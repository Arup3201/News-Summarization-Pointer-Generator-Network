When Congress is sworn in on Thursday, it will have a very different - and diverse - line up.

Not only will a record-breaking 20 female senators make up the Senate, but Congress will have a bisexual member, a Buddhist, a Hindu and two female combat veterans for the first time in history.

This modern face of Congress shows how it is finally taking a stride towards reflecting the country it is voted to represent - and it's a move the female senators are thrilled about.

'I can't tell you the joy that I feel in
my heart to look at these 20 gifted and talented women from two 
different parties, different zip codes to fill this room,' Sen. Barbara 
Mikulksi, D-Md., told ABC.

'In all of American history only 16 women had served. Now there are 20 
of us.'

As well as making a collective record, 
many of the women are making history in their own right, such as Senator
Deb Fischer, the first woman to be elected as a senator in Nebraska.

The
20 female senators are divided into four Republican and 16 are 
Democrats, yet the women believe they are more willing to work together 
than their male counterparts.

'What I find is with all due deference 
to our male colleagues, that women's styles tend to be more 
collaborative,' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Diane Sawyer.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., added that 
women have a camaraderie which helps with negotiations - something which she says the women are more successful at than the men.

'I think there's just a lot of 
collaboration between the women senators and... advice and really 
standing up for each other that you don't always see with the men,' she 
said.

Collins added that, just because the 
women all get on, it does not mean that they share the same beliefs or 
do not push for what is best for their constituents.

'I always push back the idea that there are women's 
issues,' she said. 'Because every issue from war to taxes to education affect women 
in this country. And that's why the point of having women be represented
on all committees and leading many of them is so important.'

But despite setting a new record, the women are still not satisfied there are enough of them and vow to fight for 30 per cent representation in the Senate.

Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., told Sawyer that women are still underrepresented in the Senate.

'I think that until we get to 50, we still have to fight because it's still a problem,' Boxer said.

'I think that because of this new class and the caliber of the people coming and the quality of the people coming, I think that hopefully in my lifetime - and I really do hope and pray this is the case - we will see 50 per cent.'

But progress is also underway with religion, with Tulsi Gabbard becoming the first Hindu congresswoman and Mazie Hirono becoming the first Buddhist senator. Both are from Hawaii.

It signals a move from a Congress where the question has long been which Christian denomination candidates are, rather than whether they identify with a religious group.

Former Deputy Historian for the House of Representatives Fred Beuttler told ABC there was a notable nod towards religious plurality among the 110th Congress, which was elected in 2006.

A Muslim, Keith Ellison, D-Minn., and two Buddhists, Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and Hirono from Hawaii, were elected to the House that year.

He explained that 'the House is a very representative 
institution by its design,' so as the country diversifies, 'you expect to see more religious diversity in the House'.

And some newly-appointed congresswoman have seen this in action.

'Tulsi never ran as a Hindu or thought of the campaign in that way,' Gabbard campaign spokesman Jim McCoy told ABC.

'However, after her victory there was a huge outpouring of joy and elation from Hindus throughout America and even in India. So although Tulsi has never seen it as a "victory for Hindus", it's clear that Hindus in America now feel less marginalized than they had prior to her election.'

But Gabbard is also proud to be representing another group - female combat veterans.

'While I understand all of the interest 
about my being the first Hindu elected to Congress, I feel that of 
greater importance is the fact that Tammy Duckworth and I will be the 
first women combat veterans ever to serve in Congress in our country's 
history,' she told ABC.

'Thousands 
and thousands of women in our armed forces have given their lives and 
made tremendous sacrifices, so to have the voice of women combat 
veterans in Congress is a very important milestone.'

Another new congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, has been described as an atheist, but said she simply sees herself as someone who is not part of a religious group.

She attended Brigham Young University
but left the Mormon church after she graduated, explaining that, while 
she has a huge respect for the faith, she doesn't believe in the tenets 
they do.

Sinema, and a 
handful of other non-theists, offer representation to the one in five 
Americans who say they have no religious affiliation, according to the 
Pew Research Center.

The 36-year-old is also standing out as the first openly bisexual member of Congress in history.

She
joins six openly gay and lesbian members in the most demographically 
diverse Congress in U.S. history. Senator Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., became 
the Senate's first openly gay member.

'LGBT Americans have finally broken through a glass ceiling that held firm for more than two centuries,' Chuck Wolfe, president of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, said in an email to supporters.

Among the openly gay members of 
Congress - all of whom are Democrats - one, Wisconsin congressman Mark 
Pocan, is married, while another, New York's Sean Patrick Maloney, is 
raising three children with his partner of 20 years.

'Today LGBT Americans gained powerful, authentic voices on Capitol Hill who will fight for true equality for all, and Congress became more representative of our country,' said Wolfe.

'We could not be more proud of these seven exceptional men and women.'
