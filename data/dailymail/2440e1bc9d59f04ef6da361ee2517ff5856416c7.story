A Premier League star involved in an roadside altercation with a cyclist is being hunted by police today after Sir Chris Hoy backed a campaign to find him.

Rob Lockhart claims the footballer's matt-black Audi Q7 braked suddenly in Hale, near Manchester, and he bruised his face and damaged his bike after smashing into the back.

The player then allegedly laughed in his face and told him 'good luck finding me on foreign plates', before driving off from the accident last week.

After hearing of the incident, Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy retweeted this picture of the luxury car and urged the public to help detectives catch him.

Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline they are still trying to track the international midfielder down, but would not confirm the identity of the player, who has been named online.

Rob Lockhart said the driver refused to swap insurance details after the incident last week because 'it didn't apply' when an accident involves a bike and a car

‘He pulled away and then pulled over sharply to park on double yellow lines outside a cash point. I think it was dangerous,' Mr Lockhart told MailOnline.

‘I think I hit the back window with my head, helmet and face. I had mild concussion for two to three days afterwards.

‘He got out of his car and said sorry I didn't see you. Then he just walked to the cashpoint. I didn’t feel he had any regard for me and what had just happened. He didn’t seem to care.

‘I was in shock, checking myself, the bike, and the car to see what was damaged.

‘When he walked back to his car I said we need to exchange details and he just said no. He said you’re on a bike and I’m in a car, it doesn’t matter. 

‘He was really laid back, not angry. He didn’t even check if his car was damaged.

‘I tried to get my phone out to take a picture and He laughed and said you won’t trace me because my plates are foreign. He then left the scene.

‘I called the police when I got home once it sank in.

‘I don’t know who he was, he had a foreign accent. I don’t follow football. I just want all this sorted out’.

Two witnesses took photos of the car and driver which Lockhart shared on Twitter.

But it has since gone viral.

Sir Chris Hoy was among the thousands to retweet and users soon responded by linking a local player.

Olympic cycling legend Hoy retweeted the
message: 'This chap said "good luck finding me on foreign plates" after
knocking a cyclist over in Hale. Please help find him.'

Mystery man: The Premier League player has been named online but police would not confirm his identity

A spokesman for the player’s club refused to confirm or deny his involvement in the alleged incident. MailOnline has also tried to contact his representatives.

'The driver failed to stop at the scene and we are making efforts to identify, trace and speak to him,' a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said.

'Members of the public who witnessed what happened have also helped us and we are pursuing these leads. Any information we receive that may help will be acted upon.'

Anyone with any information is asked to call police on 0161 856 7530 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
