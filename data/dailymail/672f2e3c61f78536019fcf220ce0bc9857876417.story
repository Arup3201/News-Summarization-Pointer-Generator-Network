A police detective who helped to capture the leader of the Great Train Robbery is having to sell his 18th-century farm house after being convicted of damaging it 17 years ago.

Former Detective Chief Inspector Brian McNeil was convicted following a five-day trial which cost more than £18,300 after he replaced a wooden box-winder spiral staircase with a straight one during renovations.

A court heard Long Lease Farm at Hawsker, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, was 'unfit for human habitation' when Mr McNeil, who helped arrested Great Train Robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds, bought it in 1996 and spent £250,000 saving it from ruin.

Mr McNeil, 76, and wife Jillian, 71, have now put the Grade Two listed property on the market to pay the £23,600 legal bill following their conviction.

The court at Scarborough heard how McNeil had offered to replace the spiral staircase as far back as 1999 - but there was then a dispute about which way round it should turn.

McNeil wanted it facing to the right to prevent the steps coming up through the floor of his newly remodelled bathroom.

But planning bosses at the North York Moors National Park insisted on the traditional turn to the left to preserve the original lay-out of the rooms.

The couple denied failing to comply with an enforcement notice originally served in 1998.

But they were convicted after a five-day trail costing more than £18,300 at Scarborough Magistrates Court.

Mr McNeil, originally from Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, was fined £5,000 and his wife £1,500. They were each ordered to pay £8,553 court costs.

During the renovations, ex-Scotland Yard officer Mr McNeil removed the wooden box-winder spiral staircase in the hallway and replaced it with a straight one

The couple are now planning on selling the house, but even if they could afford to stay on they still have to fix the staircase - which could cost another £20,000.

District Judge Adrian Lower called the case a 'sorry saga' and said it would have cost the couple less money if they had carried out the work in the first place.

Mr McNeil was a top 'thief catcher' whose career highlights included helping Tommy Butler arrest Great Train Robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds (pictured)

He understood how the couple must feel 
'frustrated and let down' by the rejection of a string of compromise 
plans by the national park.

But the couple were guilty under planning law - which might be seen as 'strict and Draconian' but was laid down by Parliament, he added.

Anthony Eastwood, defending, said: 'This is not a case where someone has acquired a national treasure with almost irreplaceable visual aspect which has been vandalised.

'They have restored a derelict property to a thing of relative beauty which is an asset to the national park.'

After the hearing Mr McNeil branded the verdict 'outrageous' and a 'travesty of justice'.

Mrs McNeil, who said she expected a not guilty verdict, added: 'I’m not shocked. I’m just very angry.'

The National Park has refused a Freedom of Information request to say how much the saga - involving three appeals, a full blown public inquiry and 16 years of legal proceedings - has cost.

But the McNeils claim the cost to tax payers runs into six figures.

Mr McNeil recalled: 'The staircase fell apart when we took it out. It was only held together with fence stakes.'

He dumped the wreckage in the cow shed. It was in half a dozen pieces by this time and ended up on a bonfire.

Bruce Reynolds handcuffed to two policemen for a court appearance in November 1968

The country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed 35 miles from its London destination in August 1963.

A 17-strong gang launched the raid on the overnight service from Glasgow at the Bridego Railway Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire in the early hours of August 8 in what has been dubbed the 'crime of the century'.

Led by the charismatic Bruce Reynolds, the group of criminals pulled off the notorious heist, making off with £2.6million - the equivalent of £40million today.

The train was stopped at a set of fixed signals which the gang had switched, leading driver Jack Mills to go and investigate.

He was knocked out by an iron bar wielded by an unknown member of the gang, forcing him to give up work, and he died seven years later.

Following an outcry over Charmian Biggs cashing in on her husband's crime by selling her story to the Press, the Daily Mail sponsored a fund to help Mills's family, raising more than £34,000 by the time of his death.

The bulk of the huge haul has never been recovered.

The gang shared out the proceeds at isolated Leatherslade Farm - Biggs taking around £148,000 - but thereafter things started to go badly wrong, with nearly all the gang members being rounded up by the police.

In fact, the Leatherslade Farm hide-out was a huge mistake on the part of the gang. The police were telling reporters that they were looking for an isolated farm which had just changed hands and which was 25 miles from the scene of the crime. Leatherslade met every one of these requirements.

When the gang became aware that the police were hot on their scent, they quit the farm hurriedly, leaving behind scores of tell-tale fingerprints.

Most of the ringleaders were quickly rounded up, and 11 of the robbers got jail sentences ranging from 14 to 30 years.
