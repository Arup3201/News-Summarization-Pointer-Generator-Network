The lighting of the Olympic cauldron at last night's opening ceremony was, if nothing else, wonderfully unique.

The giant flame's design was so sophisticated the studio where it was crafted looked more like James Bond's gadget workshop, its architect revealed today.

Thomas Heatherwick said he was pleasantly surprised when the idea to have 204 separate petals come together to form one giant flame got 
the go-ahead from a range of officials including Prime minister David 
Cameron and London 2012 chairman Lord Coe.

Complex: The design of the Olympic cauldron was so sophisticated it was made in a workshop that look more akin to James Bond's gadget workshop

Spectacular: It may be far smaller and lighter than previous cauldrons, bu there can be no denying the impact the flame had at the opening ceremony

Going green: Each of the 204 petals is fuelled by natural gas, which means energy consumption can be reduced significantly and the flame will still burn brightly

Measuring just 8.5 metres high and weighing 16 tonnes, it is far smaller and lighter than ones from previous events. The one lit in Beijing four years ago weighed a staggering 300 tonnes.

Mr Heatherwick, who developed it at his Heatherwick Studio in Kings Cross, London, said: 'We were aware cauldrons had been getting bigger, higher, fatter as each Olympics happened and we felt we shouldn't try to be even bigger than the last ones.

'This incredible event has 204 nations coming together, so we had a child from each country bringing these copper polished objects in.

'At the end of the Games, this cauldron will dismantle itself and radiate back down to the ground and each of those copper pieces take away by each nation and put in a national Olympic cabinet somewhere.'

The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog) requested the flame be powered by natural gas, which is pumped individually through the stems of each petal.

A spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The multiple burners means that the burn-rate is flexible.

'The gas flow can be reduced very significantly - this means we can reduce our gas consumption from 100 per cent down to 15 per cent.

'We are constantly monitoring the flow rate to ensure the minimum quantity of gas is burned.'

Locog is also working with energy company EDF to see that all of the carbon emissions will be offset.

Intricate engineering has gone into the design to ensure the flame does not go out, in any 'unforeseen circumstances' it will relit by the 'mother flame' kindled in Olympia, Greece.

The copper petals, created to be 'very small and humble objects', were made using traditionally skilled craftsmen of the sort who used to roll sheet metal to make body parts for car makers such as Bentley, according to Mr Heatherwick.

He said: 'It is like the biggest gadget that anyone can make in a shed but this shed is the most sophisticate shed in Harrogate.

'It was like the Bond gadget workshop.'

More than a billion people who watched globally along with the 70,000-plus crowd inside the stadium saw the unique petals being carried by each of the children as they accompanied each Olympic team into the stadium for the athletes' parade.

The rods which make up the stem of the cauldron are made of stainless steel with a heat and acid treatment that makes it a colour called bad black, which is actually slightly blue.

The petals are copper and the entire structure is about 8.5 metres tall and will be moved from the centre of the stadium overnight tomorrow.

It will move to the end of the stadium where the huge bell was struck to signal the start of the opening ceremony.

Like the cauldron the London 1948 organisers used when the Olympics were last staged in the capital, the cauldron will stay alight inside the stadium rather than being pitched above it.

The cauldron design team used the fact that the athletes' parade is a long event, lasting at least 90 minutes, to retrieve the elements from the centre of the parade and discreetly fix them to specific spots on the cauldron.

Practice had to be done at night as the lighting of the cauldron had to be kept secret.Rehearsals were held in the north of England, but were switched to the stadium nearer to the grand event.

Mr Heatherwick said: 'It had to stay a
 secret. We had to wait until the dancers had gone home so it was about 
3am - that was the time that it (the stadium) was available for use to 
use.'

The seven teenage 
up-and-coming athletes who made up the final torchbearers had 45 seconds
 to light the cauldron. There was then a 45-second wait before it all 
lifted into place.

By the 
time the first ring was in place the last one was lifting and coming 
together. 'So it was like a dandelion seed being blown - but it seemed 
to work, which was a huge relief,' Mr Heatherwick said.

Mr
 Heatherwick said he and artistic director Danny Boyle, the mastermind 
behind the opening ceremony, wanted something that was not about being 
bigger than the last Olympic cauldron, in Beijing, but was about the 
people involved in bringing it together.

This is one of the reasons why is was set in the centre of the stadium with the parading athletes surrounding it.

He
 said: 'We were thinking about this incredible object with 204 nations 
coming together. It was a challenge but it did not feel enough to design
 a different shaped bowl.'

The
 cauldron will be split up at the end of the Games and each piece will 
be returned to a competing national Olympic committee (NOC).

Mr
 Heatherwick said: 'The cauldron will dismantle itself and come back to 
the ground. These pieces will be taken away by the NOC.

'They will be these heated elements, maybe they will get buffed, but everyone will have a piece.'

Heatherwick Studio was established in 1994 by Mr Heatherwick, an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA and a Senior Fellow at the Royal College of Art.

He is the recipient of honorary 
doctorates from four British universities – Sheffield Hallam, Brighton, 
Dundee and Manchester Metropolitan.

He
 has won the Prince Philip Designers Prize and, in 2006, was the 
youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry.

He
 has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given 
lectures, tutorials and talks at the Bartlett School of Architecture, 
London’s Victoria and Albert Museum and Yale University.

The opening ceremony, put together by
 Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, had been cut to three hours to 
ensure athletes did not get stranded and left unable to get home.

It was only when organisers put the final rehearsals together that they realised it would run too late for public transport.

But some viewers were miffed that it still didn't finish until gone 12.30am.

Ben Wilson tweeted: 'A great opening ceremony for @Olympics last night. But I am very tired this morning as it was a late finish.'

Darren Huckerby ‏added: 'Not a bad opening Ceremony, late finish though!'

Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson previously denied the cut had been forced because of problems with the G4S security firm who failed to employ enough guards for the Games.
