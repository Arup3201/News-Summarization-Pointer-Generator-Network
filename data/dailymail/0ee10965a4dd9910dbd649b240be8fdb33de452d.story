Of all the players Manchester City might have expected to drive the final nail into their Champions League coffin Ivan Rakitic was a long way down the list, but it was the former Sevilla midfielder who got the goal on Wednesday night. 

Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp.

When he signed in the summer what was the reaction?

There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons – firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season.

Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago?

Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career. Is Rakitic better than Cesc? Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement.

Rakitic was brought to Barcelona from Sevilla for £14million to replace Cesc Fabregas, who joined Chelsea

And those characteristics are?

He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Barça last Saturday away at Eibar. Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot. He’s a very complete midfielder.

Who brought him to Spain?

Sevilla signed him from Schalke for €2.5m. It was another work of genius from the club’s Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit.

Did he consider England?

His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain. When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer. He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead. The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages.

And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday?

It will. And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven.

How did that work out for Luis Enrique?

Badly. Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic. Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta. ‘They are great players but they are not getting any younger,’ Paul Clement told me after the game. Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match. Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park. When he is at his best, he is their engine.

Now he’s back in the team for good?

He didn’t start against Malaga and Barca lost 1-0. He then played and scored against Granada. He is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at Barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at Sevilla. When he scored against Grandada he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room – the German keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and he even said of Luis Enrique: ‘He knows what he is doing, we have to trust in him.’
