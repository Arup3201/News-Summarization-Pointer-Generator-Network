An image of Manchester United's potential new home shirt for next season has started to do the rounds on Twitter.

German manufacturers adidas are designing their first Manchester United kit after signing a staggering world-record deal to replace sportswear rivals Nike.

An apparent leaked Manchester United shirt for next season is doing the rounds on Twitter 

Manchester United will end their 13-year deal with Nike at the end of the current campaign  

Louis van Gaal is expected to benefit from Manchester United's adidas kit deal

However Sportsmail understands the image of the apparent new design, which is spreading across social media, is not the new design as it will be released later this year.

Manchester United signed a kit deal worth an incredible £750million to team up with adidas from the start of next season. 

Louis van Gaal's side will end their lengthy affiliation with Nike, which has seen the American company design the Premier League club's official sportswear for the last 13 years.

United said back in July: ‘Manchester United has reached a 10-year agreement with adidas for a global technical sponsorship and dual branded licensing deal for a minimum guarantee of £750m, subject to certain adjustments.'

Van Gaal, who brought in the likes of Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw in the summer, is likely to benefit from United's kit deal with adidas by being handed another hefty summer war-chest. 

Real Madrid - Real’s agreement with adidas, which runs until 2020, was widely reported to be the most lucrative in world football before United announced their deal with the same firm.

Barcelona - Barcelona announced in 2007 that their deal with Nike, initially signed in 2006, was being extended until the end of the 2017-18 season. The original contract was worth a minimum of £24million a year.

Arsenal - This is the first season of Arsenal’s deal with Puma, which was announced in January as the biggest contract in both parties’ history.

Chelsea - Chelsea and adidas signed a 10-year deal last June worth almost £300million.

Man City - City switched from local firm Umbro to Nike last season in a six-year deal announced in May 2012.

Liverpool - In January 2012, Liverpool announced a six-year agreement with American firm Warrior. The deal is reportedly worth £25million a year to the Reds. Warrior general manager Richard Wright said at the time: 'We are here to shake up the world of football.'

Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich and adidas extended their collaboration beyond the 50-year mark with a new deal in 2011 that runs until 2020. Adidas also owns a stake in the club.

England - The Football Association ended a 60-year association with Umbro by switching to Nike. A five-year deal to run from 2013 to 2018 was announced in September 2012. The figure was not made public but the FA described it as 'a substantial investment'.'

NFL - Nike replaced Reebok as the official supplier of kit to the National Football League in 2012 in a five-year deal that is the most lucrative in US sport.
