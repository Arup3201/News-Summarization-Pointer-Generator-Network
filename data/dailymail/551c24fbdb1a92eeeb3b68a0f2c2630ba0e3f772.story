The number of plastic bags blighting Britain’s beaches has rocketed by a fifth in a year – despite vows by the Coalition to tackle the issue.

Some 72 throwaway carrier bags are now littering every mile of coastline, posing a devastating threat to marine and bird life such as turtles and gulls.

Beaches in Kent, Dorset, Devon, East Sussex and Yorkshire were named the worst offenders as campaigners accused the government of ‘empty promises’.

Under threat: British beautyspots like Tynemouth, North Tyneside and marine life are under threat from the growing problem of waste plastic bags - which Britain chose not to ban under EU law

Preservation: Volunteers also found double the number of cigarette butts, ruining beautiful scenery like Sennen beach, Cornwall

England now remains the only part of the UK with no firm proposals to tackle the issue, after Scotland pledged to introduce charges and fees in Northern Ireland and Wales have seen bag use drop by up to 96 per cent in some supermarkets.

The figures, revealed in a report by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), are a blow to the Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign – which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers.

The charity found that despite last year’s wet weather keeping many families away from the coast, litter rose by three per cent to reach its highest level since 2008. Dr Rob Keirle of the MCS said the environment secretary ‘should be embarrassed’.

‘David Cameron promised this would be the greenest Government ever – it is probably the emptiest promise ever made, because they have done so little for the environment,’ he said. ‘The biggest disappointment is that the UK Government in England has done very little, while smaller economies in Wales and Northern Ireland have imposed a charge to reduce unnecessary waste.

Blight: A recent survey found on average 72 plastic bags were found per mile on UK coast

‘These figures show that there is a lot more work to be done. Plastic bags and other waste hangs around for years. Even if we act now, it will still have an impact on the next generation.’

The figures were recorded in September last year in the charity’s annual Beachwatch survey, in which 3,366 volunteers helped clean 238 beaches across Britain.

Although the number of bags per mile dropped from 70 in 2010 to 61 in 2011, it rose again last year to 72 – an 18 per cent leap.

Shakespeare beach in Dover, Kent, was one the worst for rubbish with 68 bags full of litter collected by volunteers, followed by Chesil Cove in Dorset where they filled 60 bags with discarded waste.

Slapton Sands in Devon, Spurn nature reserve in East Yorkshire and Brighton beach were also among the top five.

MCS volunteers also found double the number of cigarette butts, while smoking-related litter such as lighters and empty packets rose by 90 per cent in a year. Almost two-thirds of the total litter was plastic, with 120 disposable bottles per mile.

The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said it was ‘disappointed’ with the figures. ‘Picking up rubbish is costly for local authorities and that money can be put to better use,’ said a spokesman.

In March, actor Jeremy Irons called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘curable problem’ of plastic bags as he backed the Daily Mail’s campaign.
