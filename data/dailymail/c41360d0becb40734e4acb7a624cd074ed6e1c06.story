Tory MP Zac Goldsmith was  last night attacked for using a reference to Auschwitz to criticise popular newspapers.

The environmentalist made the provocative remark – described by one fellow MP as ‘pathetically stupid’ – at  a star-studded session of a Parliamentary committee investigating privacy  and injunctions.

Sitting alongside actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, the MP rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of famous people simply so that they sell more copies and remain financially viable.

Zac Goldsmith made the provocative remark - described by one fellow MP as 'pathetically stupid' - at a star-studded session of a Parliamentary committee investigating privacy and injunctions. He later conceded his words could have been chosen differently

He said: ‘No one said that Auschwitz should have been kept open because it created jobs.’

Some 1.1million people – most of them Jewish – died in the concentration camp in southern Poland during Hitler’s reign of terror in the early 1940s.

Mr Goldsmith later insisted on Twitter that his point about newspaper sales was ‘valid’ but conceded he ‘could/should have made it citing something different’.

Journalists hired private inquiry agents to amass ‘a veritable treasure trove of information’ about celebrities including Hugh Grant and his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley, the Leveson inquiry into Press standards heard yesterday.

In 2003, investigators raided the office of a private agent used by national newspapers and found files detailing illegal searches for criminal records and car number plates, and other searches for addresses and ex-directory and mobile phone numbers.

Other ‘targets’ were not publicly named, but the inquiry was told one newspaper had paid £800 for the June 2001 phone bill of an unnamed sportsman from a national team.

Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘In relation to some of [the cases] it’s absolutely right that there may well be a public interest justification for the inquiry. In relation to others, however, it’s difficult if not impossible to see what public interest justification there could be.’

He was appearing before the joint 
Commons and Lords committee – separate to the ongoing Leveson inquiry 
into Press standards – because he had previously obtained a so-called 
super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had 
been leaked to the Press.

He said newspapers that engage in immoral behaviour to boost sales should be allowed to go to the wall.

But Labour MP Margaret Hodge, a member of the Parliamentary Committee Against Anti-Semitism Foundation, expressed outrage at his use of Auschwitz in his argument.

‘I just think it is a pathetically stupid comparison,’ she said. ‘He should think before he opens his mouth and hurls insults like that. It will cause a lot of distress to people.’

Last night a spokesman from the Holocaust Educational Trust said: ‘Zac Goldsmith has said that he could or should have cited a different example and we agree.’

Mr Goldsmith added on Twitter last night: ‘No one can genuinely believe I equated tabloids to concentration camps.’

He had earlier told the committee that
MPs found guilty of certain types of hypocrisy should be ‘barred from 
office’, saying: ‘If you are in a position of authority such as an MP...
it does mean you have to expect to be scrutinised very, very closely 
and very regularly to ensure you are not engaging in hypocrisy, you are 
not engaging in fraud, you are not abusing your position of power.

‘If an MP for example were to campaign
on a ticket where he was incredibly homophobic and then it emerged 
later that that person was in fact gay then I think newspapers would 
have absolute right to rip that person to pieces – that wouldn’t be 
enough. I think they should be barred from office.’

The committee also heard from Mr Grant who told how on one occasion photographers slashed every surface of his car with a knife.

And Mr Coogan said that he had spent thousands of pounds in legal fees trying to defend his privacy.

He said: ‘I at one point threatened an injunction against a newspaper that was going to publish a story about a member of my family, not about me, that was no way in the public interest.

'The correspondence that led to them not publishing cost me between £15,000 and £20,000.

‘In my pursuit of having had my phone hacked, that has cost me over £200,000 so far. I hope I will get it back one day – I don’t know – so it keeps me awake.’

Max Mosley, former boss of the FIA motor sports governing body, was also on the panel. He won damages for breach of privacy in 2008 after the News Of The World exposed his participation in a sado-masochistic orgy with prostitutes.

QUENTIN LETTS sees four crusaders take on the Press

Four rich swordsmen yesterday visited Parliament to complain about the naked nerve of the media. All were cross that their sexual/marital misadventures had been paddled in and peddled by the jaunty British Press. Such was their displeasure that they demanded a privacy law.

Their testimony was heard at times with giggling rapture by the new Privacy and Injunctions Joint Committee. The Prayer Book’s line ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’ may soon have to be Tippexed out and replaced by ‘Thou shalt not publish any article about adultery, unless first having checked with the participants that they are happy to have their horizontal activities discussed by the Daily Phwoarr’.

Our stern quartet of trouser-droppers was: Steve Coogan, comedian; Hugh Grant, film actor; Max Mosley, sometime motor-racing johnny; Zac Goldsmith, MP for Richmond Park in the Conservative interest.

Steve Coogan described stories about celebrities' sex lives as 'tawdry dirt' at the hearing

Mr Mosley is the one who had a run-in with the late News of the World after that newspaper disclosed his taste for sex parties, at one of which the laydees spoke German and wore prison uniforms. Mr Mosley, who wears a hearing aid and sounds ducal posh, is of the view that those who disapprove of his carry-on are dated moralisers.

‘This was actually a private orgy,’ he said, most indignant. How reassuring, in this day and age, to find a chap so insistent on manners. If Mr Mosley is of the view that gate-crashing has run amok in 21st-century Britain, I’m with the fella all the way, if that is the phrase. I wonder: did the invitations (not stiffies, please) to his private orgy say ‘RSVP’ and advise a time for carriages? Dress: optional. That sort of thing? Good for him! Hyacinth Bucket herself would admire such insistence on etiquette.

But a curse on my frivolity. Does it not prove what our four crusaders, our four doughty warriors for the common folk, were saying? They envisaged an Olympian ideal of journalism in which seemingly every page is an in-depth expose of malpractice in hospitals and the social services.

One of them (I forget which) complained that the very word ‘celebrity’ was ‘a pejorative term employed by the Press’. Plainly they have never received emails from showbusiness publicists imploring them to attend an event because it will have ‘a big celebrity turnout’.

The MPs on the committee addressed the witnesses by their Christian names. The peers were more circumspect.

Lord Dobbs (Con) gushed that the room’s public seats were packed (not true, as it happens). Crossbencher Lord Harries, former Bishop of Oxford, covered his face and closed his eyes during long passages of evidence. Disgust or an attack of the  post-prandial zeds? Both forgivable.

Lord Gold (Con), having heard Mr Goldsmith suggest that MPs deserved less privacy than other people, was puzzled as to how this could be made to work in law. Mr Goldsmith agreed it was complicated. Mr Grant said freelance photographers had tried to run over the grandmother of a child he fathered. Mr Mosley, who at one point used the Mitfordesque term ‘people like us’, was asked about Press regulation. He wanted ‘a body’. The man is incorrigible!

Actor Hugh Grant claims the press harassed the mother of his new born son after the birth

Mr Coogan had been to the word factory. He described stories about celebrities’ sex lives as ‘tawdry dirt’. He has the makings of a red-top sub-editor.

Mr Goldsmith was perhaps the least dogmatic of the quartet but then went and stepped in a cowpat. He compared nosy newspapers to Auschwitz concentration camp. That he was sitting next to Oswald Mosley’s son when he said this somehow accentuated the looseness of the remark.

Lord Thomas (Lib Dem) wondered why Mr Grant, having been bullied by out-of-control paparazzi, did not seek legal redress for harassment. Mr Grant, so far as I could follow, agreed that he had eventually done something like that.

So why the need for a law on privacy which would probably help chiefly lawyers, sado-masochist freaks, libidinous actors and passing totalitarians?
