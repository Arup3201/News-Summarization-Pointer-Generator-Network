A British grandmother facing the lethal injection in Texas for kidnap and murder is to have her case reviewed after lawyers claimed they have uncovered new evidence.

An appeal from Linda Carty will be sent back to her trial court in Houston for additional review in a move welcomed by human rights group Reprieve, which has been helping with her case.

Carty was convicted of masterminding the fatal kidnapping of Joana Rodriguez, her 25-year-old neighbour, who was seized by three men along with her four-day-old son in 2001.

Ms Rodriguez was later found dead from suffocation, with duct tape over her mouth and a plastic bag around her head.

Her body was found in a car Carty had been leasing and the baby was discovered in the vehicle unharmed.

There was no forensic evidence linking Carty to the crime, but the three attackers testified that Carty had hired them to carry out the kidnapping as part of a plea bargain that saw them dodge the death penalty. 

Lawyers for Carty, 56, claim prosecutors coerced witnesses into giving false evidence at the trial where she was convicted.

Their appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also argues prosecutors arranged for a deal with a co-defendant that was not disclosed to defense lawyers.

They claim that four jurors now say they either would have acquitted Carty or not given her a death sentence.

The Harris County prosecutor's office said it was investigating the claims.

Former primary school teacher Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts before its independence from Britain. 

She had lived in Houston for nearly 20 years before being arrested.

Celia Ouellette, staff attorney at Reprieve, said: 'This is a wonderful day for Linda - and for justice. 

'That a prosecutor can threaten witnesses to lie under oath and testify against a woman, who ends up being convicted of murder and sentenced to death as a direct result, is truly devastating.

'We look forward to giving Linda a day in court that is not rigged against her from the start.'

Carty's US lawyer, Michael Goldberg of Baker Botts LLP, said: 'It has long been clear that Linda should have a new trial because of the catalogue of errors in her first. 

'Linda's whole team has been working tirelessly for more than a decade to achieve this result and we look forward to giving Linda the chance at justice that she deserves.'

Carty has lodged a number of appeals against her conviction, all of which have been rejected.  

In 2010, Lord Faulkner raised her case in the House of Lords in July, asking British government to press for a reprieve.

That same year, she contested her conviction in a video plea alongside a document from the British Government outlining its concerns over the trial. 

That request for a retrial was based on claims she was given inadequate legal support during her original trial and the Government were blocked in their efforts to help her.

Her daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, has spent years rallying MPs for support  following the US Supreme Court's refusal to re-open her case.

In 2012, the Foreign Office said it was lobbying the Texas authorities to stop her execution, with a statement reading: 'The Prime Minister and British Government are deeply concerned.'

Ms Carty has always insisted she was framed by three men in revenge for her work as an informant working for a drug enforcement agency.

If the latest efforts fail, she is to be executed by lethal injection. 

The last British woman to be executed was Ruth Ellis in 1955. She was hanged for shooting her lover outside a pub in North London.
