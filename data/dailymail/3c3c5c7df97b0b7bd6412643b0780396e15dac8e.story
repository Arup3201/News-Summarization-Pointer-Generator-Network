Jailed: Dennis Scott, pictured outside Hull Crown Court on Friday, falsely claimed more than £23,000

A 65-year-old man who claimed almost £24,000 in benefits despite having £88,000 in the bank has been jailed.

Dennis Scott received thousands in pension credits between 2009 and 2014 by falsely claiming that he had less than £4,000 in capital.

But a recent house sale meant the grandfather had significantly more money - making him ineligible for the credits, which are intended to guarantee pensioners a minimum income.

He claimed the money had been destined for his grandchildren, saying he had wanted to give them a 'better start in life'.

Scott, from Barnsholme, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dishonestly making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions. 

He was jailed for eight months at Hull Crown Court on Friday. 

The court heard the £23,776.16 he falsely claimed had been repaid in full by July last year. 

Defending, Antony Farrell told the court that Scott was a family man who had wanted to give his grandchildren a better start in life than the one he had been given.

Jailing him, Judge Richardson QC said Scott had behaved in a 'shameful fashion'. 

He said: 'It must be made very clear to you and to anyone like you who is tempted to defraud the state in respect of social security benefits that a prison sentence is likely to follow such conduct.

'Your flagrantly breached that system by your shameful conduct. For a man of your years you ought to know better.' 

He also noted that Scott had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.
