Around 1.5 million people living in Ebola-ravaged Sierra Leone are today in lockdown as experts reveal the official death toll has reached almost 3,000.

Six months into the most deadly outbreak in history, the latest figures indicate the disease may be slowing pace in Guinea - the site of the original outbreak in February.

But experts have warned a dire lack of beds and community resistance in some areas are helping the virus spread.

Meanwhile efforts to straighten out muddled data are gradually revealing an epidemic even more deadly than first thought.

It comes as the World Health Organisation revealed the global death toll is close to 3,000 in the worst epidemic on record since Ebola was first discovered in 1976

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said of the 6,263 cases of Ebola recorded in five West African countries, 2,917 people had died as of September 21. 

Compared to the agency's previous update, the latest data shows 99 more deaths in Liberia since September 17.

However there have but only four new cases in Sierra Leone since September 19 and three in Guinea since September 20.

The proportion of cases in the last 21 days - the incubation period of the virus - has also fallen in the three nations, suggesting the spread of the disease may be slowing. 

The WHO said: 'The upward epidemic trend continues in Sierra Leone and most probably also in Liberia.

'However, the situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilised.

'Between 75 and 100 new confirmed cases have been reported in each of the past five weeks.'  

The WHO said Liberia had 315 bed spaces for Ebola patients and aid agencies had promised to set up 440 more, but the country needed a further 1,550 beds that nobody had yet offered to provide. 

In Sierra Leone, 297 planned new beds would almost double existing capacity, but a further 532 were needed.

With too few beds and a huge shortage of expertise, the effort to tackle Ebola has switched to setting up care centres in communities and training locals, including 11,000 teachers in Liberia, to educate people about how to combat the disease.

In Sierra Leone travel has been restricted into and within three more 'hotspots' in the West African nation, where 1.5 million people live.

Sierra Leone is one of the hardest-hit countries in an Ebola outbreak which has swept through West Africa in the last six months.

More than 2,900 people have been killed by the virus, the World Health Organisation today said.

The health agency said the situation in Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate, driven by a sharp increase of cases in the capital, Freetown. 

In an address to the nation on Wednesday night, President Ernest Bai Koroma put Port Loko, Bombali, and Moyamba districts under isolation, meaning only people delivering essential services can enter and circulate within these areas.  

WHO also noted that these districts were seeing a rise in cases.

In other areas, including Freetown, homes will be put under quarantine when cases are identified, a government statement after the address revealed.  

The current epidemic, the largest on record since Ebola was discovered in 1976, has also hit Liberia,and Guinea. 

It is thought to have infected more than 6,000 people.

One victim is thought to have slipped across the border from Guinea to Senegal, though the disease does not appear to have spread there.

Similarly in Nigeria, the virus appears to have been stopped in its tracks, with the outbreak seemingly contained.

The president of Nigeria has declared his nation 'Ebola-free' after eight people died and another 20 cases were recorded when a Liberian man crossed the border and died in July

Around 20 cases and eight deaths, have been linked to the death of Patrick Sawyer, a U.S. citizen and consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance who entered the nation from Liberia, after attending his sister's funeral. 

She too died after becoming infected with the disease.

Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said on Wednesday: 'Nigeria is free of the virus now but we know that to be permanently free from it, we must remain vigilant and work with WHO and the international community to eradicate it completely from our sub-region and forestall the possibility of its re-emergence on our shores through migration.'   

The outbreak's unprecedented scale and geographic spread have pushed governments to impose severe measures, like the cordoning off of entire towns or regions. 

Last week, Sierra Leone imposed a three-day nationwide lockdown, confining its six million people to their homes while health teams spread out to look for the sick and educate people about the disease.

The exercise revealed the outbreak is worse than thought, the government said, with 160 Ebola cases found during the shutdown.

'There is a desperate need to step up our response to this dreaded disease,' the Sierra Leone government statement said.  

'The prognosis is that without additional interventions or changes in community behavior, the numbers will increase exponentially and the situation will rapidly deteriorate.'

Two districts near the outbreak's epicenter - Kenema and Kailahun - had already been isolated. Liberia, the country hardest-hit by the disease, cordoned off areas of its capital at one point to slow transmission.

In Sierra Leone, 75 percent of targeted households have been reached by 'social mobilisers'. 

The WHO said: 'The upward epidemic trend continues in Sierra Leone and most probably also in Liberia. However, the situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilised'

But in some areas of Guinea, where an Ebola team was killed last week, there was still resistance to such efforts, the WHO said.

'For example, there are reports from Fassankoni, Guinea, that communities have set up roadblocks to screen entering response teams,' it said.

The risk of infection among health workers is also much higher than previously thought. 

A recount has shown 81 have died in Sierra Leone out of 113 who caught the disease - a 72 per cent death rate, instead of a 40 per cent rate previously reported.

The WHO said its latest data did not yet include the cases and deaths found during a three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone.
