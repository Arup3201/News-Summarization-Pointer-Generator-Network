Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell's bicycle, which was at the centre of the 'plebgate' row, is now for sale on eBay.

Mr Mitchell was riding the seven-year-old bike when police officers refused to let him leave Downing Street via the main gate in September last year.

It was claimed at the time that Mr Mitchell swore at the officers and called them 'plebs'.

By Sunday evening, the bike had already attracted more than £1,000 in bids, from a starting bid of £200

Mr Mitchell - who strenuously denies the allegation that he used the word 'plebs' - was forced to resign after a series of damaging headlines.

He has now put the Reflux Westminster bicycle on eBay as he seeks to give it 'a good home out of the limelight'.

All the proceeds from the sale will go to the charity Nyumbani UK, which helps HIV and AIDS affected children in Kenya.

The 18-speed two-wheeler, complete with front basket, has so far attracted an anonymous bid of £1,020 ahead of the auction's end on Thursday at 7pm. The first bid was £200.

Scotland Yard are investigating the Downing Street dispute in the wake of a Channel 4 investigation which cast doubt on the original account of the incident.

The programme revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate at the time, as had originally been claimed.

An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also since been called into question.
