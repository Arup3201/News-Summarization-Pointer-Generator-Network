A quiet village in East Anglia has been rocked after a haul of weapons were allegedly uncovered at the home of its parish council chairman.

Deadly automatic guns, including an Uzi sub machine gun and an AK-47 assault rifle, were allegedly found during a police search of the home of Jim Arnold in the village of Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk.

Arnold, 49, who has been chairman of Wyverstone parish council for around seven years, has been charged with four counts of possessing prohibited weapons.

The charges relate to the Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine gun, an AK-47, a self-loading rifle and a bolt action shotgun.

Arnold, a former crane driver who is suffering from terminal cancer, was remanded in custody by Ipswich magistrates yesterday.

He entered no plea to the weapons charges and was deemed too ill to enter pleas to two charges of assault.

A series of controlled explosions were carried out by an Army bomb disposal team at his home on Monday to destroy other suspect items found by police.

Officers refused to confirm what had been found, other than describing it as 'some produce'.

Arnold's house, which he shared with his wife Lyn, 45, remained cordoned off today as a search of his four acres of land continued.

Officers were first called to the house on April 13 to reports that a woman in her 40s had been assaulted on March 27 in an alleged domestic incident.

Arnold, who is believed to have been a licensed firearms holder, was arrested on suspicion of assault before police began searching his home.

Andy Mellen, the vice chairman of Wyverstone parish council, said: 'Jim Arnold is a diligent council chairman.

'He is well known in the community and has served the village well in various ways for many years.'

Another local who asked not to be named said: 'It is no secret that Jim is very ill and only has weeks or months to live.

'He was a legitimate firearms holder and had an interest in guns for many years.'

Another villager criticised police, saying: 'No-one is telling us anything. They won't say how long it's going on for or whether there's any danger.

'It's been like this for the past week. It all goes quiet then all of a sudden everything kicks off, the police move in and all hell breaks loose. It's been a total nightmare.'

Anne Hornsblow, who lives near Arnold's home with her husband Rob and their children, said: 'Everyone in the village is wondering what's going on.

'There's a lot more talking going on and everyone seems to be taking their dogs for a walk outside our house to see what's been happening.'

Other villagers said they had been told to expect a heavy police presence to remain in the village for another fortnight while further searches are carried out.

Sgt Jon Taylor of Suffolk Police said the controlled explosions were carried out to 'dispose of some produce' found at the property.

He said the investigation had 'far-reaching implications' for the whole force, with officers drafted in from across the county.

Arnold will appear before Bury St Edmunds magistrates on April 28 for a further hearing on the assault charges. He is due before Ipswich Crown Court on May 1 to answer the weapons charges.

A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'Police are continuing investigations following the discovery of a number of weapons at an address in Wyverstone.'

The spokesman confirmed that a 45-year-old woman from the Stowmarket area had been arrested on suspicion of possession of a prohibited firearm.

She has been interviewed by officers and bailed to return to police on May 21.
