A Wheel of Fortune contestant was about to win a shot at the million dollar grand prize when he bumbled his answer and lost out big time.

The contestant, whose name was Paul, had to solve a puzzle that was missing just one letter when his brain failed on him.

And before he could figure out what happened, the guy next to him quickly stole his thunder.

Ecstatic: The tuxedoed contestant named Paul was thrilled when he won the chance at $1 million on Wheel of Fortune during their season premier in Las Vegas

Lucky: Paul got very lucky when his spin landed on the One Million spot, which could have won him a lot of money. But his luck was about to change

And its all because of the word 'Curio.'

Things were looking good for Paul when he spun the famous wheel on the long-running game show’s season premier’s. It landed on the coveted Million Dollar prize, in between treacherous Bankruptcy spots.

Paul asked for a C, and there were three.

He triumphantly held his million dollar panel, which would have turned into a real million dollars had he continued on his winning track.

But his unfortunate misstep came when he solved the puzzle.

Still happy: Paul triumphantly held up his game piece. Had he kept on that track, he could have eventually won the million bucks

'Curry-O': With only one missing letter, Paul's win seemed like a lock, but he mispronounced 'curio' and lost big time

The words ‘CORNER CURIO CABINET’ tried to come out, but curio just didn’t sound quite right.

After a long, hushed pause, the judges hit the wrong answer buzzer and Paul’s neighbour went on to pronounce the words correctly.

Paul first looked shocked.

‘It didn't come out the way you intended it to, we'll take a look at it during the commercial to make sure we treated you fairly,’ said host Pat Sajak.

After that, Paul just looked sad.

He should not feel lonely, however. Last year, a contestant made headlines after losing $4,000 for pronouncing ‘swimming’ with ‘g’ at the end.

Sad face: After judges deemed his bumbled word an incorrect answer, Paul went from jubilant to depressed
