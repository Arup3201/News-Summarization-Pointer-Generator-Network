An Australian government agency has labelled the Sydney siege a terrorist attack.

In positive news for businesses affected by the December attack on the Lindt chocolate cafe, Treasurer Joe Hockey today labelled the siege a 'terrorist incident' for insurance purposes.

The ruling under the Terrorism Insurance Act means that insurers will not be able to refuse claims because of terrorism exclusion clauses in their policies.

Three insurances have registered claims relating to the siege to date, according to the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation. 

Mr Hockey said he was pleased the companies did not apply terrorism exclusion policies.

Today's announcement follows reports one of the hostages is seeking a 'six figure sum' to speak to media outlets. 

Marcia Mikhael, one of 18 hostages held prisoner by the mad gunman Man Horan Monis, is reportedly seeking a 'six figure sum' for a televised interview.

Daily Mail Australia understands several hostages have held discussions with television networks about telling their story. 

The Federal and State governments are both conducting a review into the siege to examine what lessons could be learned. 

The NSW Coroner announced this week that an inquest will be held into the siege from January 29.
