A girl of 14 died yesterday after a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into a group of three friends as they walked to school.

Liberty Baker was hit outside her academy secondary school in the Oxfordshire town of Witney.

Despite efforts to save her, the popular pupil – whose father is a businessman and mother an Oxford University employee – was pronounced dead soon after being taken to hospital.

Killed: Liberty Baker, 14, was named locally as the victim of a fatal car crash in Witney, Oxfordshire. It is believed she and two friends were hit after a car mounted the pavement while she was on her way to school

Tragic death: Liberty was a described as a 'beautiful kind person, always making people around her happy'

Friends Mercy Greaney and Bronte 
Moulder, both 14, were also knocked down as they walked with her to 
Henry Box School at 8am and are being treated in hospital for minor 
injuries.

A 40-year-old man who was walking nearby was also hit and suffered a broken hip.

Last
 night an 18-year-old man was being questioned by police after being 
arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

It is thought  he had only recently passed his driving test.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron, who is the MP for Witney, expressed his 
condolences on Twitter and urged witnesses to contact police.

He said: ‘My thoughts are with friends and family of the 14-year- old girl killed by a car in Witney this morning.’

Tributes: Distraught pupils left flowers at the scene of the crash this morning which killed Liberty Baker, 14

Fatal: The 14-year-old victim was pronounced dead and three others hit by the car were in hospital

Sophie
 Hicks, 14, a friend of the three victims, said she usually accompanied 
the girls but had stayed at home yesterday because she was ill.

She
 said of Liberty: ‘She was one of my best friends. It doesn’t quite seem
 real, I feel numb. I was on the phone to Mercy and she said they 
couldn’t watch as Liberty was getting CPR. I can’t believe she has gone.
 She was just so lovely. She always put others before herself and she 
had a great sense of humour.’

Liberty lived with parents Paul, 46, and Maureen, 44, and ten-year-old brother Finley in a £250,000 detached home in Witney.

Her
 father runs an engineering company and her mother describes her 
employment on Facebook as working at Oxford University’s St John’s 
College.

It is understood to be in an administrative role.

Yesterday, friends laid flowers on the grass verge where the girls were hit by a blue Citroen.

Francesca
 Hicks, 17, said the driver had just passed his driving test, adding: ‘I
 see him driving down the road to go to work in the morning.

‘It only clicked that it was him when I saw the car because his car has been modified a bit so it is recognisable.’

Pupils left floral tributes at the scene and a Facebook group was created in the schoolgirl’s memory.

One friend wrote: ‘Liberty Baker, you were way too young. Heaven’s gained a beautiful angel. RIP.’

Campaigning
 for a memorial tree in the school grounds, the Facebook group said: 
‘Liberty Baker was a beautiful kind person, never sad, always making the
 people around her happy.’

Pupils were told about the tragedy at a special assembly less than an hour after the schoolgirl died.

A
 man who lives near the crash scene said: ‘My wife heard a horrendous 
scream and looked out of the window to see a young girl in school 
uniform, who had been knocked over by a small blue car.

‘The
 children from the nearby estates meet up and walk down our road to the 
school in town every day, and she must have been on her way to school 
when she was hit.’

Thames Valley Police are appealing for witnesses following the incident.

Last
 night the driver continued to be interviewed on suspicion of causing 
death by dangerous driving but officers were understood to have ruled 
out fears that he deliberately drove at the pedestrians.

Police
 said they were trying to establish how he lost control of the car and 
whether he was distracted at the time of the crash.has been killed and 
two others have been injured after they were hit by a car as they walked
 along the pavement.
