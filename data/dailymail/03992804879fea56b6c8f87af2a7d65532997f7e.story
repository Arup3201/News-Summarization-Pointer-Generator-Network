Barcelona defender Dani Alves continues to make the most of his time off during the international break after being left out of the Brazil squad to play France and Chile.

After releasing a new charity single earlier this week with former Barca team-mate Jose Pinto, the right back appeared to spend his Saturday serving up hot dogs.

Hungry punters popping in for a lunch time snack will have been surprised to see the 31-year-old behind the counter as he served up the fast food favourite.

Alves shared a video of him lathering up a hot dog with mayonnaise (or similar) to his official Instagram account.

Alves is famed for his wacky behaviour on social media and this week's antics will do nothing to shake that image.

Meanwhile, Alves looks set to leave Barcelona on a free transfer this summer. The full back is yet to be offered a new deal to stay at the Nou Camp and he reportedly has his pick of several clubs.

Alves is believed to be in discussions with Paris Saint-Germain, while Manchester United have also been credited with holding an interest in the former Sevilla defender.

Reports in the Spanish press on Saturday claimed that Alves had agreed to join Laurent Blanc's PSG and was even looking at houses in the French capital.
