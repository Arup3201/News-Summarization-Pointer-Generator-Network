A dancer who was taken to hospital by her mother when she started suffering stomach pains was shocked to discover she was in labour and about to give birth.

Jodie Smith, 17,  started feeling unwell last Monday night, but when her concerned mother Lesley, 47, took her to A&E in the early hours, doctors revealed she was pregnant and about to become a mother.

Just hours later, on July 23, Miss Smith gave birth to son Jack Arthur, who weighed in at 8lbs, while shocked Lesley rushed to buy baby supplies.

Miss Smith, a keen dancer from Carleton Glen in West Yorkshire, had no idea she was pregnant as she hadn’t put on any weight.

Mother Mrs Smith, said: 'We are still a bit shell-shocked. Jodie hasn’t stopped smiling’.

'She has been going to college, going to work, doing her dance classes, going to the gym, all as normal. She wasn’t ill and looked just as slim all the way through.'

She said Miss Smith started feeling unwell with stomach pains last Monday evening, while she and her husband Michael, 43, were out for the evening.

Mrs Smith said: 'She’d gone to her 
boyfriend’s, but came home because she was feeling so unwell.

'I told her
 to take two paracetamol, but I got a call from her brother later that 
evening saying Jodie was still poorly and had been sick.'

'At 1am she came and woke us up and I called the on-call GP, but they told us we’d have to go to the Wakefield walk-in clinic.

'She was in so much pain by then I knew we’d never get her there, so we took her to A&E.'

Once at Pontefract Hospital, doctors quickly discovered Miss Smith was pregnant and in labour, and transferred her to Pinderfields in Wakefield, where she gave birth in the early hours.

Midwives believe Jack was a couple of weeks overdue, and that at the very least he was full-term. New mother Jodie (centre) who sat her A-levels this summer, is still planning to go to college to study dance

As Miss Smith, a dancer, had no ante-natal car, doctors were initially unsure what stage the pregnancy was at - shortly before she went into labour

As she’d had no ante-natal care they were unsure what stage the pregnancy was at.

New grandmother Mrs Smith added: 'I was in the supermarket at 6.30am buying baby stuff, because we had absolutely nothing.

'The midwives think Jack was a couple of weeks overdue, and certainly full-term. He’s had all his checks and he’s fine. Even they can’t believe it.'

Miss Smith, who sat her A-levels this summer, is still planning to go to college to study dance. Her boyfriend, Danny Yeoman, 19, said: 'It’s been a shock, we’re still getting used to it.'

Jack’s surprise arrival has also brought the family up to five living generations, and Mrs Smith said the family were delighted with the new arrival.

She added: 'They’re all really pleased, but a bit overwhelmed at the moment.'
