Aston Villa midfielder Aleksandar Tonev will have a medical on Monday ahead of joining Celtic on a season-long loan.

The 24-year-old Bulgarian was a target for Celtic before joining Villa for £2.5million last summer. 

He flew to Glasgow on Sunday night and talks will continue on Monday.

Elsewhere, Paul Lambert is hoping to keep hold of defender Ron Vlaar amidst interest from Ronald Koeman's Southampton.

Lambert is keen to open talks with the 29-year-old centre-half once the transfer window shuts, but was far from impressed with Koeman for admitting publicly that Vlaar was 'an option'.

The Villa boss said: ‘There is been absolutely no enquiry, not one iota on it. The only thing I am disappointed in is people talking about him, who should know better than to talk about other people’s players.

‘I don’t think you accept it. I think out of respect you don’t do it, you don’t get involved in that. That is my opinion. You will have to ask others what they think but I am just giving my opinion.’
