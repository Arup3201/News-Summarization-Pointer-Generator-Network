Leaving your seat at half-time during an Ohio State football game is never a good idea, because there’s every chance you’ll miss out on a world-class spectacle.

It’s at half-time that The Ohio State University Marching Band strut their superbly choreographed stuff and their latest performance – a tribute to Michael Jackson’s Bad album, released 25 years ago – entirely justified their claim to be The Best Damn Band in the Land.

During Saturday’s game against the University of Iowa, the band’s 225 musicians played a medley of hits, including the title track, Billie Jean, The Way You Make Me Feel and Man in the Mirror – but it was the formations that provided the wow factor.

Good to be bad: The Ohio State University Marching Band spell out the name of Michael Jackson's hit album

Spectacle: It's probably best not to leave your seat for too long during an Ohio State football game

Tribute: The Marching Band played a medley of Michael Jackon's hits

Moving and shaking: Perhaps the best moment was when the Band formed an outline of Michael Jackson and moonwalked across the pitch

They seamlessly moved from one to the other - at one point forming the word ‘Bad’ and the crown that adorns the album cover.

The most impressive moment, though, arrived during Billie Jean, when the band formed an image of Michael Jackson himself, complete with a white glove – and then moonwalked.

Footage of the clip, posted to YouTube, has gone viral, with over two million views to date.

Unsurprisingly, internet users have been heaping praise on the performance.

James McCallum said: ‘I've been in a marching band in my life. This is totally awesome! I'd rate this as one of the BEST videos EVER to hit YouTube! Congratulations to the OSU Band! Very IMPRESSED! Especially the Moon Walk across the field. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!'

Sally B, meanwhile, wrote: ‘A fitting tribute to the The King. Incredible performance by the OSU- the precision, creativity and wow moment was just unbelievable!'

And Chase Krogh posted this comment: ‘Blew my mind. The most insane thing I have ever seen a marching band do!!!’

The band’s previous half-time performances have included tributes to hit video games, with music from the likes of Halo and Pokemon, and The Beatles.
