A new mother was found shot dead  Wednesday night, after family received a call to check up on her at home.

Family members arrived at the Mars, Pennsylvania home of 42-year-old Tara Sherri Bouie around 11:30om Wednesday night and found her lying dead next to her 5-month-old baby who was sitting in a high chair.

It appears Bouie suffered a gun shot wound to her head, but her young child was left unharmed. Investigators believe the baby could have been left unattended for more than 11 hours.

Bouie had only been living in the home for a few months, and Pennsylvania State Police Lt Thomas Dubovi said in September it had been the scene of a raid where a man was arrested in connection with a homicide investigation. 

However, Lt Dubovi could not give more details on the SWAT activity since neighbor State Police or Adams Township Police were involved.  

'This is a quiet neighborhood, a rural but affluent neighborhood. Most people around here work and have jobs. We don’t see large amounts of drug activity or anything like that. So, this is unusual,' Lt Dubovni told KDKA. 

Family told the station that the woman has a boyfriend, but that he doesn't live with her. 

Police continue to investigate the murder and so far have not made any arrests.  

'The circumstances right now are leading us to believe there was foul play involved,' Lt Dubovni told WPXI. 

Bouie's child is now being cared for by family. 

An autopsy was set to be performed on Thursday.   

Bouie allegedly had a boyfriend who did not live with her. Her baby is now being taken care of by family.
