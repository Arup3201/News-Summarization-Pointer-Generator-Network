They seem like an unlikely pair. She is a pro-democracy campaigner turned global heroine, known by her followers as 'The Lady', while he is an ageing former Radio 1 DJ nicknamed the Hairy Cornflake.

But as Dave Lee Travis greeted Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday by taking her hand and kissing it they seemed like old friends.

Miss Suu Kyi met the DJ for the first time after revealing how his show gave her a lifeline during her  years under house arrest in Burma.

Her hairy cornflake: Aung San Suu Kyi meets DJ Dave Lee Travis as she visits the BBC World Service in London at the start of her historic four-day visit to Britain

The Nobel laureate had previously told
 how she listened to Travis – also known as DLT – on the BBC World 
Service while in confinement.

On a visit to BBC Broadcasting House 
in central London she briefly met the DJ, whose music request programme A
 Jolly Good Show she had said made her world 'much more complete'.

During their meeting, when asked if she knew who Travis was, Miss Suu Kyi said: 'I know, I heard you yesterday.'

The DJ told the Burmese opposition 
leader: 'It's just such a pleasure to meet you in person after all the 
nice things you said about the programme.'

Historic meeting: Dave Lee Travis said it was a 'pleasure' to finally meet Aung San Suu Kyi who listened to his show which he presented for 20 years

She told him she was once 'thrilled' to have heard the voice of a Burmese boy on the programme.

'Well that's the World Service,' 
Travis replied. 'It does what it says on the tin, and I am just glad to 
have been a part of the things that you listened to that helped you.'

The DJ kissed Miss Suu Kyi on the 
hand, adding: 'It's a real privilege to meet you.' Miss Suu Kyi, who 
spent 15 years under house arrest by the former junta until her release 
last November, arrived in Britain after visiting Norway on Friday to 
accept her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.

Historic visit: Ms Suu Kyi, who used to live in Britain, visited the country for the first time in 24 years

Foreign Secretary William Hague later 
led MPs in singing Happy Birthday to her during an appearance at the 
London School of Economics on her 67th birthday. She is due to address 
MPs and peers in Parliament later this week.

The trip comes after David Cameron 
became the first foreign leader to visit Burma since the military junta 
handed power to a civilian government and Miss Suu Kyi won a 
parliamentary seat in a by-election.

An Oxford student in the 1960s, she 
married a British academic in 1972 and they had two sons, but after she 
went back home in 1988 to nurse her ailing mother she did not leave 
again until last week.

She did not see her sons for more than
 a decade and was unable to be at her husband's side when he died of 
prostate cancer in 1999 because she knew that if she left the country 
she would not be allowed back in.
