Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said the open door policy for EU workers had benefited Britain

Workers from Romania and Bulgaria expected to flock to the UK next year are no different to Brits who own holiday homes in France or Spain, a Home Office minister has claimed.

Lib Dem Jeremy Browne insisted he was relaxed about the numbers of migrant workers who could come to Britain when working limits on the two countries are lifted next year.

And he hit out at the UK Independence Party for wanting to ‘pull the drawbridge’ to the outside world.

Mr Browne, who is widely seen as a leading figure on the right of the Liberal Democrats, defended the open door policies which have seen hundreds of thousands of people from Eastern Europe move to the UK.

He told the New Statesman magazine that he is in the ‘unfashionable minority’ the influx of Eastern European workers to the UK.

He said: ‘I don’t think there was a mistake. It was transformational in terms of Britain’s relationship with countries like Poland.

‘It was in our foreign policy interest but, at a much more direct, micro level, there are lots of employers in my constituency and around the country who are full of praise for the contribution that Poles have made to their businesses and the economy more generally.’

The government has refused to publish forecast for the number of Romanians and Bulgarians who might move to Britain, after Labour failed to accurately predict how many Poles would come here for work.

But Mr Browne said: ‘They’re only complying with the same rules as British people who live in Spain or have holiday houses in France, or who work in Germany.’

He conceded that immigration has put pressure on public services, but added: ‘I think if you look at the overall ledger . . . the positives outweigh the negatives.’

With UKIP ahead of the Lib Dems in most polls, the junior coalition partner risks being eclipsed by the anti-EU party led by Nigel Farage.

But Mr Browne insisted: ‘Essentially, the big choice the country faces is not really embodied that well by the two biggest parties: it is represented by the Lib Dems and UKIP. That’s where it’s thrown into stark relief.’

The number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers in the UK has risen dramatically in the last decade

He said it is a choice between ‘pulling the drawbridge up, erecting barriers to the outside’, and ‘being a welcoming, liberal, outward-looking, internationalist country that embraces the opportunities of globalisation’.

Even before the immigration rules change figures already show about 100 Romanians and Bulgarians a day are getting jobs in Britain.

The number of people from the two EU countries has soared by more than a third over the past year, even though they are not yet  allowed to work freely in this country.

The number here has reached a record high of 141,000, according to the Office for National Statistics – over-shadowing the total number of Australians and New Zealanders for the first time since records began. There are already fears of an  influx of Romanians and Bulgarians next year when current restrictions on their rights to work in Britain are lifted.

At present, they can only work here if they are self-employed, or are one of a limited number of seasonal workers allowed to come for up to six months a year but must then go home.

From January, they will have  free access to the labour market in Britain, like other European Union citizens.

The influx is hardly surprising, given that Bulgaria’s minimum wage is 73p an hour and in Romania it is 79p, while in Britain it will rise to £6.31 for over-21s later this year.
