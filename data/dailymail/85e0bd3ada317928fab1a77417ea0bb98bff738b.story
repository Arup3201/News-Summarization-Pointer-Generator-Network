Luke Shaw has his eyes on the prize at Manchester United.

The England international progressed through the Southampton academy and impressed enough to earn a £31m move to Old Trafford last summer, which he hopes will provide a trophy laden career.

Shaw posted a ’throw back Thursday’ tweet with a picture from when he was a child, posing next to the Premier League trophy with the caption: ‘#TBT my dream has always been to play for England and in the Premier League. Hopefully one day I will lift this cup.’

However performances will have to improve drastically for Louis van Gaal’s side, who are 12 points behind leaders Chelsea, with 13 matches remaining in the season.

Shaw has a troubled start to life at Old Trafford under van Gaal, with the Dutchman questioning the left back’s fitness levels.

However the England international has managed to play his way into the United side, making 15 appearances so far this season.

Shaw is suspended for Saturday’s trip to face Swansea in the Premier League having been sent off against West Ham earlier this month.
