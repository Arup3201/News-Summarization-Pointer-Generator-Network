It was the old man's anger immortalised by a rifle-toting Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino.

Now scientists have pinpointed the moment kindly old gents start shouting 'get off my lawn' - and it seems it's on their 70th birthday.

A 15-year study found that although stresses and strains reduced for men after the age of 50, happiness still began to dip 20 years later.

Menacing: Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. Researchers examined more than 1,000 war veterans over 50

Psychologists interviewed more than 1,000 men repeatedly between 1989 and 2004 and found they had fewer 'hassles' as they got older and daily life became simpler.

Yet their overall happiness then reduced around the age of 70 for a huge range of reasons, the scientists found.

Bitter: A 78-year-old Clint Eastwood as Walt

They included health problems, declining brain power and the death of family and friends, lead author Carolyn Aldwin told National Public Radio's Linton Weeks.

Dr Aldwin, of Oregon State University, said it was difficult to establish exactly what made men grumpy.

She told NPR: 'I'm not certain anyone has studied this exactly. But we do know that the most difficult sort of caregiving is for Alzheimer's patients, who often have personality changes like irritability or hostility - that is, grumpiness - which make them much more difficult to deal with.'

But the researchers could not say for certain whether the stress of caring for someone else was a direct cause of grumpiness, she added.

The study examined 1,315 men aged 
between 53 and 85, mostly war veterans, who were part of the 
long-running Normative Aging Study established by the U.S. government in
 1963.

Groups used by the study have also been used to look at smoking risks, stress and cardiac health.

The findings, published in the latest edition of the journal Psychology and 
Aging, said grumpiness in older men was caused by a mixture of 
changes within the brain and external factors.

Around four-fifths of the men said life became easier at age 50, but only 20 per cent said they were happier after they retired.

Most of them agreed they were less happy after the age of 70, the report said.

The boy's a menace! U.S. films are full of stereotypes of the grumpy suburban man, including Walter Matthau (left) as fed-up neighbour George Wilson in the 1993 version of Dennis the Menace

Stereotype: In Up (2009), Carl Fredricksen refuses to leave his house after his wife passes away

Clint Eastwood, who returned to the screen as embittered war veteran Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino (2009), was only the latest in a long line of suburban grumpy old men on the silver screen.

They have included Walter Matthau, who played George Wilson in Dennis the Menace (1993) and one half of the self-titled Odd Couple in Grumpy Old Men (1993).

Screen legend Jack Nicholson played a grumpy widower surrounded by people he did not like in About Schmidt (2002), while the animated character Carl Fredricksen in Up (2009) is so grumpy after his wife's death that he refuses to sell his house to developers.

There is a shred of good news, however. No matter how grumpy they were at the start, most of the old men finally manage to crack a smile just before the credits start rolling.
