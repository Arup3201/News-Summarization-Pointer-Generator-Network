Just when 
we thought Princess Beatrice was the reigning Princess of style, her 
little sister pulls a serious fashion statement out of the bag.

Princess Eugenie looked high fashion in a printed skater dress as she attended Tracey Emin's star-studded birthday party.

The 
24-year-old was joined by long-term boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank,
 and her mother, Sarah Ferguson, at Mark's Club in London for the 
artist's birthday last night.

The young 
royal looked sophisticated and chic in the statement dress, which
 she accessorised with an embellished clutch and black ankle strap 
sandals.

She also wore a charity bracelet she designed herself as Patron of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.

She designed it as an exclusive and limited edition with British jewellery brand Daisy London and all proceeds of the sales go towards the RNOH's Charity Redevelopment Appeal.

The charitable Princess mingled with the likes of Bob Geldof, Vivienne Westwood and the birthday girl Tracey Emin herself.

54-year-old Sarah opted for a chic black dress but added a bright injection of colour with a tailored blazer.

Her
 trademark fiery red hair had a loose curl and was worn down. 
The children's book author chose sensible shiny black ballet flats for 
the outing.

Fergie's youngest daughter was making the most of the balmy evening in a
 summery patterned dress that highlighted her perfect porcelain 
complexion.

And it looked like Sarah Ferguson and Princess Eugenie Of York were loving their family night out as they continued the celebrations at swanky London club Loulou's on Thursday evening.

The mother-daughter duo cut elegant figures when they emerged from the hotspot after a fun-filled evening.

Indeed, there's a never a dull moment for the busy family, who are often spotted out at various events together.

Speaking to
 Harper's Bazaar in 2011 in defence of hanging out with her daughters 
Princess Beatrice, 25, and Princess Eugenie, 24, the Duchess Of York 
said she didn't see a problem with it and prides herself on having a 
close family unit. 

'We
 do everything together, even go clubbing, which caused some people to 
say, "Can’t you back off? They don’t want their mother there."'

'So
 I asked them and they said, "No, we want you to come because you’re 
hip-hop, crazy, mad." I just don’t see the world like most people. I 
don’t tell my daughters anything. They decide; I guide,' she said.

The
 proud parent added added her daughters are: 'extraordinarily bright. 
Even with dyslexia, Beatrice got A’s in history and classics.'

Crown jewels: The 54-year-old kept accessories minimal with a simple bangle, necklace and earring combination
