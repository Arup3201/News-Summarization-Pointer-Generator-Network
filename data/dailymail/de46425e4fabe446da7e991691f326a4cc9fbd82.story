It has long been known as the Holy Grail of comedy… and the Monty Python stars could barely contain their excitement yesterday as they announced their comeback.

Despite all being in their seventies with a combined age of 357 years, the legendary troupe are getting back on stage together for the first time in 30 years.

John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin have all agreed to reunite.

Getting back together: The five remaining stars of Monty Python (from left: Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Graham Chapman who died in 1989) are to reunite for a show

Cult comedy: The group's surreal TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus was first broadcast in 1969

Once the secret was out there yesterday, Idle, 70, posted a giddy Twitter message: 'Python meeting this morning.

'Can't wait. Press conference Thursday will be live.'

Jones,
 71, revealed that the ageing comedians hope to boost their bank 
balances: 'We're getting together and putting on a show – it's real.

'I'm quite excited about it. I hope it makes us a lot of money. I hope to be able to pay off my mortgage!'

And
 he's not the only one hoping the cash will help. Cleese, 74, has made 
no secret that despite the phenomenal success his comedic talent has 
brought him, he has been left crippled financially by a £12.5million 
divorce.

Earlier this year 
the stars were also all ordered to pay extra royalties to a former 
producer after losing a High Court battle over their hit stage show 
Spamalot.

A judge ruled 
that Mark Forstater, a producer of the 1975 film Monty Python And The 
Holy Grail, was entitled to a seventh of the profits from the spin-off 
musical, which has grossed well over £100million.

The
 reunion comes after several failed attempts to reform by the group, 
which was last seen together in 1983's The Meaning Of Life. However, 
according to sources, the surviving members realised 'it was now or 
never'.  

It is understood 
the Pythons will perform live again, with the potential for a film or TV
 show to follow. But it is unknown if it will be new or old material or 
both.

More details are due 
to emerge at a press conference tomorrow, which will take place at The 
Playhouse Theatre in London's West End where Spamalot is running.

Idle
 is believed to have had higher earning power in recent years and is now
 worth an estimated £10million after he co-wrote Spamalot with John Du 
Prez and paid the other Pythons a fee, estimated to be £1million.

Cleese,
 who married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade last year, divorced his 
third, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, in 2008. He launched a stand-up tour 
called Alimony Tour to help fund the payments.

JOHN CLEESE: Now 74, Cleese has had a long career of acting success since his days with Monty Python.  His work writing and starring in BBC hotel comedy series Fawlty Towers won him the greatest acclaim, and he also appeared in films including A Fish Called Wanda, Clockwise, and Bond films The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.

Four-times married Cleese has also found success with a string of one-man shows.

TERRY GILLIAM: After Python the 72-year-old went on to become a successful screenwriter and director, with hits including The Fisher King, Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, and The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus.

The American-born Python has been married to British wife Maggie for 40 years, and they have three grown-up children. In 2006 he renounced his U.S. citizenship in protest at President George W Bush, and spends a lot of his time in Umbria, Italy, because he can now only spend 29 days a year in America.

TERRY JONES: The Welsh-born comedian went on to work as a director, author and musician.  Now 71, he went on to co-write the screenplay for Labyrinth, and directed Erik The Viking and The Wind In The Willows. Last year Jones, who is married to wife of 42 years Alison Telfer, announced that he had proposed to lover Anna Soderstrom, 30, with whom he has a three-year-old daughter, Siri.

Life after Python: Terry Jones, now 71, and Eric Idle, now 70, went on work in the entertainment industry

ERIC IDLE: After Python Idle, now 70, went on to act in and do voiceovers for various projects including Robbie Coltrane's Nuns On The Run, Terry Jones's The Wind In The Willows (Idle played Ratty), South Park and The Simpsons.  In 2004 he created Spamalot, the musical based on Monty Python's Holy Grail, and he performed his 1991 hit song Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life at the London 2012 Olympics closing ceremony.

MICHAEL PALIN: Sheffield-born Palin, 70, has gone on to find further fame as a maker of travel documentaries, a career he stumbled upon after making a show about his childhood love of train journeys for the BBC in 1980. Since then he has made programmes including Michael Palin: Around The World In 80 Days, Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure, and Himalaya With Michael Palin. He and wife Helen have three grown-up children and when not travelling he lives with her in north London.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN: Leicester-born Chapman, who played the lead in Holy Grail and Life Of Brian, went on to write shows after Monty Python but never achieved such great success. He died, after developing tonsil cancer and secondary spinal cancer, aged 48 in 1989.  Speaking at a private memorial service for Chapman, Cleese claimed later that he was the first person in Britain to say f*** at a memorial service.
