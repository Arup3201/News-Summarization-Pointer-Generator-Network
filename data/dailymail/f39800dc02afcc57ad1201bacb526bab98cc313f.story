It’s August in Florida which means locals were braced for a potential hurricane - and so were the throngs of Republicans gathering for the party's national convention which begins on Monday. 

Tropical Storm Isaac is expected to pick up speed and threatens to hit the Gulf Coast as thousands of visitors flock to Tampa Bay for the Republican National Convention.

Forecasters predict the storm could turn into a hurricane by next Thursday, as it gathers strength with winds already measuring 45 miles per hour.

The minimum speed for a Category-1 hurricane is 74 mph. Having
formed off the Island of Guadeloupe, Isaac is moving up the Caribbean 
putting Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba in its path.

The islands are on alert and expecting more than a foot of rainfall, which could cause flash floods and mudslides.

At the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 
Cuba, military personnel prepared for the approaching storm and stacked 
sandbags around buildings on the base.

On Wednesday, 
pretrial hearings at Guantanamo Bay for five prisoners accused of 
launching the September 11 attacks had to be postponed due to the 
looming storm.

The storm’s course is uncertain and 
some predict it could hit the southern tip of Florida by late Sunday, 
before it travels up to Tampa on Monday, as the national political 
meeting gets underway.

The GOP gathering, where former 
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is expected to be selected as the 
Republican presidential nominee, would be plagued with severe rains, 
thunderstorms and high winds.

The convention is being held at the 
Tampa Bay Times Forum, which is located in a mandatory evacuation zone, 
should Isaac become a Category 2 hurricane. A Category 2 hurricane would
sustain winds of 96 mph.

Preparations have been underway for nearly six weeks before the event begins on August 27 until August 30.

Nearly $20 million was spent to prepare 
the scene for the political pow wow, with up to 300 people working round
the clock to refurbish the venue, home to the Tampa Bay Storm arena 
football team and the town’s NHL team, the Tampa Bay Lightning.

But the mayor of Tampa, Democrat Bob Buckhorn, seemed unfazed by the looming tempest.

‘We're
watching it. We're tracking it. I think we're going to be OK but we'll 
be prepared in the event it heads this way,’ Buckhorn told CNN.

‘We hope it moves further away from us, but if it doesn't it's still going to be a great convention,’ he added.

But
local small business owners, counting on business from delegates and 
convention watchers, are worried the weather could put a dent in their 
hopes of profiting from the event. 

'At
this point, the money is already spent. Mother Nature, you just can't 
control it,' souvenir shop owner Richard Moore told WTSP-TV.

'The
ball is already in motion, they can't stop it, can't send back stuff,' 
he said about local business that have stocked up in advance of the slew
of attendees, adding 'I'm a glass half-full kind of guy and hoping for 
the best.'

The gathering is expected to generate
$200 million in revenue, a figure that could be severely slashed if 
weather prevents visitors from landing in the town.

Tampa
Bay is the second largest city in Florida, with a population of 2.8 
million. Roughly 50,000 visitors are expected to travel to Tampa for the
convention.

‘With the convention or without the 
convention, I can tell you this is August 22, hurricane season, and 
normally anywhere in Florida or the Gulf of Mexico we should monitor any
system that forms,’ Lixion Avila, a senior hurricane specialist at the 
Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.

Visitors will descend upon the Florida town for the convention, when Mitt Romney, left, is expected to receive the party's presidential nomination. Romney has selected Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), right, as his running mate

The hurricane season on the Atlantic begins in June and typically lasts until November but August is known as one of the most active months. Isaac is the ninth named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season.

August 24 will mark the 20 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 hurricane that hit the Sunshine State in 1992 before it moved to Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It is the third costliest hurricane in the U.S., causing damage valued at up to $26 billion.

Hurricane Ike, which hit Louisiana and Texas in 2008, is second with $37.6 billion in damage and Hurricane Katrina, the devastating storm of 2005 that wreaked havoc on New Orleans, was the costliest with $108 billion in damage.
