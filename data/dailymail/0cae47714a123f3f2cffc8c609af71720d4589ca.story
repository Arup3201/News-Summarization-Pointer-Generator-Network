Steffon Armitage has taken another step towards switching allegiance to France in time for next year’s World Cup by being included in a 74-man squad named on Friday by Philippe Saint-Andre.

The 28-year-old Toulon back-row forward has been overlooked by Stuart Lancaster since moving to the Cote d’Azur in 2011, despite earning a series of prestigious awards, culminating in being crowned European Player of the Year last season.

Knowing that he is unlikely to add to his five England caps because of the RFU edict against picking players based overseas, the former London Irish openside is attempting to exploit new eligibility rules to qualify for France.

Having included Armitage on a list of 10 foreigners to be monitored with a view to selection, Saint-Andre said: ‘On this list there are three players who are not eligible for France yet — Armitage, Alex Tulou and Blair Connor — but all three are in the process of getting a French passport.’

The amendment to the IRB’s eligibility criteria has been made to comply with Olympic regulations ahead of the introduction of Sevens at the Rio Games in 2016. 

A committee must decide if a player who has represented one country, but who has not been capped for at least 18 months, can switch nationality with a view to playing Sevens, but ultimately for 15-a-side rugby, too.
