Pressing ahead: Michael Gove has said he will axe legal quotas of school fields for team sports

Michael Gove yesterday vowed to press ahead with rule changes that could see hundreds of schools sell off their playing fields.

The Education Secretary remained defiant over his plans to scrap regulations setting out the minimum space schools must provide for team games, facing down critics by telling them they were simply wrong.

Opponents say the rule change - due to come into force tomorrow - will make it easier for schools to justify cutting back the size of their playing fields.

Since details of the move were first revealed as Britain celebrated Olympics success, an online petition has attracted more than 150,000 signatures demanding a rethink.

Challenging Mr Gove in the Commons yesterday, Nic Dakin, Labour MP for Scunthorpe, said: 'Considering the need to preserve our Olympic legacy, what does the Secretary of State have to say to those 150,000 people who signed a petition against his plans which will come into force this Wednesday to scrap minimum size regulations for school playing fields?'

Mr Gove replied: 'I admire their passion, but they are wrong.'

Under the current rules, schools must provide between 2,500 and 75,000 square metres of space for team games depending on the number of pupils they educate.

In future, they will merely be required to provide 'suitable outdoor space' for physical education and play.

The current detailed table of minimum space requirements will be rewritten and simplified but will be laid down in non-binding guidance rather than law.

The Department for Education says the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly and cheaply to accommodate a surge in the birth rate.

Officials also say that schools will find the new rules easier to follow because bureaucratic restrictions have been removed, allowing heads to decide what is best for their pupils.

But Labour claims the move could lead to 'salami slicing' of school pitches.

An Early Day Motion tabled in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband to demand the scrapping of the new regulations has been signed so far by more than a dozen MPs.

Opposition: 150,000 people have signed a petition and shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg commented on the importance of having good sports facilities

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: 'We need our schools to have the best possible sports facilities so that we encourage a new generation of Olympic athletes, and healthy and active young people.

'By telling schools they no longer need proper playing fields the Government is letting down our young people.

'Labour believes all pupils should have access to playing fields, regardless of where they go to school. David Cameron said he wanted to 'spread privilege' in education - he should show he means it by reversing this decision before even more damage to school sport is done.

'If David Cameron believes in school sport he should back Labour's motion to protect school playing fields.'

But the DfE defended the move. A spokesman said: 'For the first time these regulations require all schools to provide space for all the activities in their PE curriculum and for outdoor play.

'We have made the rules much easier for schools to follow by removing bureaucratic restrictions and freeing schools up to decide what is best for their pupils.'

He said that previous rules on playing fields favoured outdoor team sports, with no requirement for schools to have space for activities in the curriculum or for play time.

The Coalition has come under intense pressure over its strategy for creating an Olympic legacy through schools.

It faced criticism for scrapping a scheme aimed at building links between schools and clubs and reducing the amount of ring-fenced cash for school sport.

Its record on the sale of school pitches also came under fire with revelations that more than 30 had been sold off since 2010 despite a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement.

Some decisions to allow sales had been taken against the advice of a panel of experts.

The Government has also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of PE a week.
