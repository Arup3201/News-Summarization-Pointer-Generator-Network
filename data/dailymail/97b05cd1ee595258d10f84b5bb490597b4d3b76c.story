A woman has described how she stings herself with bees up to 100 times a week, in large part, for sexual pleasure.

In the latest episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction, Margaret, 53, from Morningview, Kentucky, admits that ten stings 'makes sex great'.

The couple do not elaborate on this bizarre detail, though Margaret speaks unapologetically about her love of the bee sting sensation.

Bizarre addiction: Margaret, 53, from Morningview, Kentucky, loves stinging herself with bees and admits that ten stings 'makes sex great'

'I sting myself on my hip, my elbows, on a finger, my ankle, my forehead, on the tip of my nose,' she says on the show.

'The most I've ever given myself was between 15 and 20 in my left hip. I really love stinging myself with bees!'

Margaret says she began stinging herself around a decade ago to relieve her arthritis pain.  She now keeps hives in her back garden for a steady supply.

'[I heard] people [had] been using it to relieve certain pain symptoms,' she explains.

'The first time that I stung myself, it 
didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would,' she recalls. 'And it just got
 easier every time.'

Now Margaret indulges herself with around 15 stings a day.

Holding a bee in a set of tweezers, she describes how she taps the insect's abdomen against herself to make the stinger puncture her skin.

'There's a couple of trigger points right here that I like to sting,' she says, prodding at the skin around her kneecap. 'I can kind of put a little dent in it with my fingernail.'

She says the resulting sensation is 'peppery' and while 'no two stings are alike', she 'feel[s] relief from all of them.'

Unlikely habit: Margaret started stinging herself to relieve arthritis pain over a decade ago

Margaret's husband, JD, admits he is concerned about his wife's dependence on bee stings, though it does not surprise him.

'She's always had kind of a taste for looking at the odd side of things,' he says. 'At this point now, with 15 stings a day, that's when I've started to get really concerned about this.'

In the episode of My Strange Addiction, a doctor warns Margaret that her next sting could be fatal as her constant use could cause an allergy to develop.

But while Margaret experiences guilt over the bees that have died as a result of the habit, she has been unable to give up - though she has cut back to around ten stings a day.

My Strange Addiction documents people who turn to atypical compulsions in order to deal with 
their emotional demons.

The new season also features a woman who has grown her hair to 21-feet-long, and a 19-year-old girl who is hooked on eating sand.
