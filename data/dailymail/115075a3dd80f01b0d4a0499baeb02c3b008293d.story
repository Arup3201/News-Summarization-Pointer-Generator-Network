A British man accused of drug dealing in Dubai was forced to watch fellow prisoners being raped while being held for seven months without trial, his devastated sister has claimed.

Suneet Jeerh, 25, is one of three Britons facing up to 15 years in jail for possession of Spice' - a type of synthetic cannabis which 
was only made illegal in the United Arab Emirates nine days before they 
were arrested.

The trio claim they were
tortured and beaten by police and all denied the charges when they finally appeared 
in court today after seven months waiting on remand.

Speaking to the Daily Mail Mr Jeerh's 32-year-old sister Daveena claimed 
all three men had been let down by the Foreign Office and Consulate 
officials since their arrest last year.

She said: 'My brother was beaten after he was arrested and when he asked
the consulate officials to take photographs of his injuries they simply
refused.

'He has been forced to watch rapes in the prison he is 
being kept in.

'Instead of helping these men the consulate officials have
been putting obstacles in the way of their families. We feel we have 
been totally let down by the Foreign Office and consulate.'

'In 
Suneet's case the British officials took 60 days to release to my family
a report on what had happened to him. They even refused to accept 
passport identification that our family were his next of kin...they 
wanted to see bank statements and all sorts of other documentation.'

Karl Williams denies the drug charges police have accused him of

Jeerh from Ilford, Essex, is standing trial alongside Grant Cameron and Karl Williams, both 25, from 
Wanstead, East London.

They were on 
holiday in Dubai when they were arrested on July 10 last year and 
finally appeared before a judge in the Dubai Criminal Court after being 
held without trial.

They are among a group of six Britons facing lengthy sentences for 
possession or dealing in 'Spice' - a type of synthetic cannabis which 
was only made illegal in the United Arab Emirates nine days before they 
were held.

One of the group - 23-year-old Alistair Ross Cameron - has
already been sentenced to 10 years in prison and is appealing his 
conviction.

The three men facing trial were forbidden from speaking and 
their hearing was held in Arabic without a translator being present.

The
case was then adjourned until March so two witnesses - policemen Osman 
Saeed and Osman Ali - could be called to give evidence and face 
allegations from the defendants that they were beaten, given electric 
shocks and threatened with guns.

The men, who are filing a 
counter-accusation against the officers, say they were forced to sign 
documents in Arabic after being threatened without knowing what was 
written.

Plumber Williams says he was driven into the desert and 
tortured before being taken back to his room in the Media Rotana hotel, 
where he claimed the policemen placed a towel over his head and 
electrocuted his testicles before pointing a gun at his head.

He said
in a statement released by human rights charity Reprieve: 'I started to
believe I was going to die in that room.

The three men were arrested 
outside the Dubai Marina yacht club, a popular drinking spot for British
expats, after a tip-off to Dubai police's drugs division.

Yesterday's
hearing was attended by Alex William's brother Liam - a 30-year-old 
Dubai-based publishing executive - who said: ' Whatever was in the car 
had nothing to do with my brother.

He was only here on holiday for one 
week.' Spice was made illegal in the UK in December 2009, when it was 
classified as a class B drug, but had been sold openly in the UAE for 
two years before it was banned on July 1 last year.
