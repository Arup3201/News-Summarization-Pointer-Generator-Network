Almost half of both France and Nigeria's starting lineups for their World Cup last-16 tie in Brasilia came from the Premier League.

Here, Sportsmail looks at how the English-based contingent got on in Monday's game:

One winner: Kenneth Omeruo comes out on top against Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud in this duel

Familiar foes: Odemwingie and Evra came up against each other on the international stage

Troubles in front of goal: Victor Moses hooks Benzema's shot off the line as Nigeria looked to hold the French

Best of enemies: Kenneth Omeruo and Laurent Koscielny go up for a header during the last-16 tie

Anticipation: Chelsea youngter Omeruo tries to get in the way of a Giroud shot

19 minutes: Tottenham's Huge Lloris gets beaten by Emenike at his near post. Luckily the goal is ruled out

28 minutes: Olivier Giroud appears to aim an elbow at John Obi Mikel - but the incident goes unspotted by the referee.

37 minutes: Patrice Evra has his arms wrapped around Peter Odemwingie but the referee decides it does not warrant a penalty.

39 minutes: Finding himself running onto a pass on the edge of the box, Mathieu Debuchy blasts one of France's best chances wide.

48 minutes: John Obi Mikel brilliantly nutmegs Chelsea target Paul Pogba with a backheel

63 minutes: Odemwingie flashes a snapshot at goal from the edge of the area but Lloris gets down low to save his powerful effort.

68 minutes: Victor Moses races back behind his goalkeeper to clear Benzema's shot off the line and keep the score at 0-0.

74 minutes: This time it's Mikel's turn to clear off the line as France turn up the pressure.

Hugo Lloris (France, Tottenham) - 90 minutes

The Spurs 'keeper was perhaps lucky not to concede in the first half after Nigeria's Emenike was narrowly adjudged to be offside as he put Nigeria ahead, beating Lloris at his near post.

Otherwise the sweeper-keeper was at his commanding best, dominating the high balls that Nigeria tried to send into the French penalty area.

Mathieu Debuchy (France, Newcastle) - 90 minutes

The Newcastle man, starting ahead of new Manchester City right back Bacary Sagna ably supported Mathieu Valbuena down the right hand side.

He was rarely tested defensively and even had a decent effort at goal towards the end of the first half with a shot that flew wide.

Laurent Koscielny (France, Arsenal) - 90 minutes

Solid at the back, as he has been all season for his club.

Koscielny dealt well with the high balls that Nigeria sent into the box but in truth he was rarely troubled except occasionally by Odemwingie's pace.

Patrice Evra (France, Manchester United) - 90 minutes

Luke Shaw might find it difficult to find a place in the Manchester United side if their stalwart left back continues this kind of form.

Evra was imperious down the left hand side but he perhaps could have conceded a penalty in the first half as he grappled with Peter Odemwingie - showing some of the worrying frailties that he displayed at Old Trafford last season.

Olivier Giroud (France, Arsenal) - 61 minutes

Could be considered lucky to even be on the pitch for as long as he did after appearing to aim an elbow at John Obi Mikel in the first half. Giroud has been a frustrating figure for many Arsenal fans this season and he showed why against Nigeria.

The French have experimented with pairing Giroud with Karim Benzema or playing the latter alone. Giroud's inability to combine with his strike partner upfront for France was one of the reasons they struggled to create much in the first hour of the game. France looked much better when he was withdrawn for goalscorer Antoine Griezmann.

Battle: Giroud has to fight off the attentions of Omeruo as France seek to break down Nigeria

Bad boy: Giroud was substituted by Didier Deschamps as France went in search of a winner - which they found

Speed merchant: Chelsea loanee Moses uses his pace to get him around Manchester United's Evra

War: Victor Moses comes out on top in this challenge with Karim Benzema, with Odemwingie looking on

Kenneth Omeruo (Nigeria, Chelsea/Middlesbrough) - 90 minutes

Looked strong in the centre of defence against one of the World Cup's most effective offensive sides.

While he seems unlikely to get a chance at Chelsea, Omeruo could be in line for a Premier League loan after a successful spell at Middlesbrough last season.

John Obi Mikel (Nigeria, Chelsea) - 90 minutes

The Chelsea man was his usual self in the heart of midfield, keeping things ticking over and playing the unglamorous simple passes that are often under-appreciated.

While he usually plays slightly further forward for his country, Mikel returned to his withdrawn role to combat France's runners from midfield. He found himself in the right place at the right time to clear off the line in the second half. His backheel on Pogba was brilliant.

Victor Moses (Nigeria, Chelsea/Liverpool) - 88 minutes

Moses came into the side in place of the injured Michael Babatunde but struggled to make an impact.

His clearance off the line with the score at 0-0 was brilliant though, and not something you would usually expect from the flying winger. He was unlucky to see his curling shot deflected by Debuchy as Nigeria tried to grab an equaliser.

Peter Odemwingie (Nigeria, Stoke) - 90 minutes

Odemwingie has always been known as a bit of a troublemaker - and he was one of Nigeria's brightest sparks, using his space to cause problems for the French backline.

He slammed one shot which Lloris did well to save but couldn't quite make the breakthrough for his side.

We're through: Giroud might have had a poor game but he celebrates with North London rival Lloris here
