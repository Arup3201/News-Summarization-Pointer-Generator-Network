Complaints: Rachel Oxburgh resigned after her firm Casabu failed to deliver hundreds of orders

She is a privately educated peer’s daughter who marketed her business as a godsend for busy price-conscious mothers.

But the Honourable Rachel Oxburgh has resigned after hundreds of customers were left without the Christmas presents they paid for.

She spoke proudly of her business credentials after co-founding the mail order firm, Casabu, in April 2012, selling ‘branded’ children’s clothes and toys at discounts of up to 90 per cent.

Dr Oxburgh, whose father is former Shell chairman Lord Oxburgh, said she was aiming for a million customers by the end of 2013 and the website was named one of the top 20 start-ups of 2012 by judges including Duncan Bannatyne, of Dragons’ Den.

But for reasons which are unclear, it hit dire financial troubles and Dr Oxburgh, 49, resigned as chief executive and director over Christmas.

Scores of angry mothers have taken to the company’s Facebook page to complain.

One disgruntled customer, Kerry Campling, wrote: ‘I haven’t received a refund, an apology or a reply to the numerous emails I have sent, and I still want some of the goods.’

Another, Natasha Harpur, added: ‘I am completely at my wits’ end with this. It’s a lot of money and the stress it caused me over Christmas was unbelievable.’  Others complained about the ‘disgusting’ and ‘diabolical’ service they had received and their inability to get through to the firm’s customer service hotline.

A statement on Casabu’s Facebook page on January 6 read: ‘We have been working over the holidays to get to the bottom of the issues that caused a number of orders to go astray in December and now have a clear picture.’

The company promised ‘a full refund’ and their ‘most sincere apology’ to customers who had not received their goods, adding: ‘We will be starting on this process tomorrow and expect to have it complete by early next week at the latest.’

But when that deadline passed last week, customers accused the firm of making an ‘empty promise’. Natalia Znatkova wrote on Facebook that she was still waiting for orders placed in early November and there were ‘no signs of activity’ from Casabu.

Last March Dr Oxburgh was optimistic about the firm’s future, saying: ‘The beauty of the flash sales model is that we don’t need to sink capital into stock and we can use this investment to grow our customer database.’

The married mother of two – who was educated at the £14,451-a-year Perse School in Cambridge – also told Reuters in April that she had a ‘resilient’ business model.

At her £1.5million home in  West London, Dr Oxburgh confirmed she had resigned and  said Casabu’s co-founder, John Heseltine, had also stood down as a director.

She added: ‘The average customer’s order was £35 to £40  so I understand that they have lost out, but we are in a much worse position.’

Patrick Bradley, of Ingenious Ventures, which invested in Casabu last year, said: ‘Just because Rachel has stepped down … does not relieve her of her responsibilities for the way the business has been run.’

Sue Jones, of Westminster Council, said Trading Standards became aware in December of ‘problems with the company’ after customers called the Citizens Advice Consumer Service.
