There is no denying that 2013 is already the year of Cara Delevingne.

The fun-loving 20-year-old landed her debut British Vogue cover this month and has been the darling of New York fashion week.

But while the bushy-browed model has seen her star rise rapidly and even been dubbed the new Kate Moss, Cara has revealed that she never had any intention of pursuing a career in modelling.

Unplanned career: Cara Delevingne says she never planned on being a model and it 'just happened'

Speaking to Vogue.co.uk about
her glamorous career, she said: 'I love modelling, I am so lucky and I 
appreciate everything I have because I never thought it was going to 
happen. I never really thought I would become a model, it just sort of 
happened.'

And despite being one of the most sought-after models of the year, fresh faced Cara said: I'd always looked at those girls and thought, "Those are super humans, 
they're so gorgeous and glamorous all the time and then I thought, wait 
I'm a model, that's so weird."'

In recent months Cara has starred
alongside Romeo Beckham in Burberry's SS13 campaign as well as landing the DKNY campaign and walking the runway for Chanel, Diane Von Furstenberg and DKNY.

The girl that is everywhere: Cara has walked countless New York fashion week shows already and is likely to take London Fashion Week by storm but still can't believe her luck

She also holds a much coveted title as one of Victoria's Secret's 'Angels' and despite catching the eyes of teen heartthrobs Justin Bieber and Harry Styles after walking the runway in the lingerie giant's annual show, she still can't believe her luck.

She told Vogue: 'There's these goddess women like Victoria's Secret models, that's not me, it's crazy, it's mad.'

'The best thing about modelling is the clothes, the people I meet and the
people I get to work with, the places I go, the experiences I've had.

But as with any job, there are always
highs as well as lows. 'The worst part of being a model? I hate high 
heels, more than anything.

'It's the physical 
side of modelling that is bad, not sleeping, having to work 78 
consecutive days,' she said.

All about the people: Cara says one of the best things about modelling is the people she has met and who she gets to work with (L) She shares a moment with Diane Von Furstenberg and (R) with best friend and fellow model Jourdan Dunn

She is widely loved in the industry for 
her sense of fun and fellow models Karlie Kloss and Jourdan Dunn often 
complement her fun loving attitude and crazy personality.

And despite her goofy, outgoing personality, Cara maintains that she is a shy girl at heart and told the fashion site that it is all about having confidence even if you think of yourself as a shy person.

She added: 'If you're willing to work that hard and if you want it that badly, it's 
all about determination.

'If you really want it, you'll be able to 
achieve it.'

Never saw it coming: The 20-year-old says she looked up to models as 'superhumans' and found this 'then and now' photo that someone posted on Instagram very amusing
