Tennis was a game made for three, according to the first Victorian rule book.

Our ancestors started playing the game outdoors for the first time thanks to a Birmingham lawyer who experimented with the sport.

Instead of the Wimbledon as we know it with strict singles and doubles teams - and no mixing of the sexes - the early Victorians were more liberal.

First rules: The 
1874 ‘Lawn tennis or Pelota rules of the game’ by Thomas Henry Gem was 
the first of its kind

History: Fairlight House in Ampton Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, where the first ever game of lawn tennis was played in 1859. The modern game is now played by millions all over the world

In a version called the Unicorn one player could play against two opponents. And while ladies were discouraged from playing in general, they were permitted to battle against the men.

This means if Wimbledon were played the Victorian way we could see a big female name like Serena Williams play the likes of Murray and Djokovic.

Tennis experts insist the 1874 Lawn tennis or Pelota rules of the game by Thomas Henry Gem was the first of its kind.

How to play: In a version of the game called the Unicorn one

discouraged from playing - they were permitted to battle against the 
men

Former PE teachers Sue Elks, 69, and 
Christopher Elks, 68, from Wythall in the West Midlands explained the 
difference the modern game has with the tennis of yesteryear.

'The version of tennis where two people against one was called the unicorn match.

Classic: Pictured is old-style tennis gear at the grave of Major Thomas Harry Gem, who invented to modern game

'The game could be played with a racket from the old real version of tennis that was indoors, a wooden bat from the old medieval game five, or simply with the hand.

'The scoring was to 15, where whoever reached this figure first in single points would win the game.'

There are several contenders for the title of ‘inventor of tennis’.

The game was patented by Major Walter C. Wingfield in London and the game became a global sporting phenomenon shortly after this - with tennis courts popping up from the US to China.

By 1877 the All England Club held the first tournament at Wimbledon.

However, the game evolved from a combination of real tennis - which was played with a ball and net, but was the exclusive preserve of the aristocracy - and rackets which was popular with the working classes in pubs and prison yards.

Ms Elks, Christopher and a host of other tennis-buffs believe the true pioneer of the game was Thomas Henry Gem, who brought the game outside thanks to the new innovations in technology at the time.

He is understood to be the inventor of lawn tennis.

Thomas Henry Gem created the game of lawn tennis with friend JBA Perera in a back garden in Edgbaston, Birmingham, before forming the first lawn tennis club in Leamington Spa in 1872.

'For the first time the newly developed India rubber allowed balls to bounce on grass,' said Ms Elks.

'Also the invention of the lawn mower meant that grass was now in such well-kept state that play was possible on the lawn.

'It’s only thanks to these new types of technology that the game of tennis as we know it could evolve.'

The game we now recognise as tennis was formalised in the 19th cenutry as 'lawn tennis'.

Bouncy rubber balls and well-kept lawns were now available across the land to enable what we previously an indoor sport to move outside.

But early version of the game have existed since the 12th century, where French monks would play at hitting balls back and forth with their palms.

The so-called jeu de paume (game of the palm) took centuries to develop into a game involving nets and rackets.

By the 16th century, the game was popular in both England and France, and would be played with solid rackets, much like the offshoot sport known as real tennis today.

The name tennis comes from the French word tenez - an instruction to 'hold!' or 'receive!' which players would shout to their opponent before serving.

It was a favourite of Tudor King Henry VIII, whom some accounts say was playing a match while his second wife Anne Boleyn was executed.

It's place in English and French history was confirmed during the reign of Elizabeth I, when Shakespeare's Henry V was first performed.

Evolution: Tennis fashion has changed over the years, as the above line-up of ladies dressed in the styles of different periods shows

Towards the start of the play, Henry receives a mocking gift of a treasure chest full of tennis balls from the Dauphin of France. The warlike king then promises to 'march our rackets to these balls' and 'play a set shall strike his father's crown' - fulfilled by their clash at the Battle of Agincourt.

Tennis societies and associations proliferated across Britain in the late 19th century, with the first Wimbledon tournament played in 1877.

The game's popularity continued to swell in decades to come, and by the 1960s international interest was huge, and the top players were huge stars, earning vast sums of money - a trend which today shows no signs of abating.
