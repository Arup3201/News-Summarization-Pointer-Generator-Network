When temperatures plunge, most people head straight indoors.

Not for the residents of Donetsk in Ukraine.

Several daring locals took to the ice-cold waters of the city’s frozen ponds over the weekend, marking the start of the eleventh season of ice swimming.

Diving into the ice-cold water of Scherbakov Park's second city pond, participants performed comedy fairy-tale sketches and danced to traditional folk music.

Such is the tradition of swimming in the icy waters that even several members from the Donetsk Peoples' Republic National Council joined in.
