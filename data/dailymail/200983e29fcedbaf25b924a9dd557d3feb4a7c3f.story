Russia's leading state television company fired an entire department today after its facebook page lauded Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels as a 'great' figure alongside Winston Churchill.  

'We apologise to our readers for the unethical publication,' said VGTRK media group after a public outcry.  

The scandal erupted after Kremlin-controlled Vesti-24 news channel on Monday published a montage of quotes about Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, to mark the 90th anniversary of the death of the Soviet Union's founder this month.

Russian TV station Vesti 24 posted this picture of Nazi Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels on its facebook page today on a list of 'great men'

Goebbels, the Third Reich's fascist ideologue, was cited as praising Lenin for 'leading' the Russian people 'from suffering' - and to freedom.

Other 'great men' on the list included British wartime leader Churchill as well as Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein. Lenin's successor Josef Stalin was also included.  

The inclusion of Goebbels led to a furious backlash readers of the Facebook page which is followed by 1.1 million people. 

By Tuesday night, the Nazi had been dropped from the list, though Stalin - a figure revered by some older Russians - remained.  

Because of the scandal 'we 
announce that our Social Media Marketing team has been fired in its 
entirety', stated the company. The page has now been removed

It was unclear if the posting was a deliberate act to cause embarrassment at the media giant or an unintentional blunder. 

The company is seen as a mouthpiece of the Kremlin, part of a tightly controlled Russian media which strongly backs President Vladimir Putin. 

Opposition photographer and popular blogger Dmitry Aleshkovsky described VGTRK's main news show as 'Goebbels' television,' in a Facebook comment.

The company's deputy general director Dmitry Kiselyov was also recently named head of Russia Today, a new state news agency established in an apparent bid to improve the country's battered international image.

Another television station caused controversy by debating whether the Russians should ave surrendered to the Nazis during the siege of Leningrad (pictured)

The Goebbels quote was published on the 70th anniversary of one the Russian people's greatest collective sacrifices, the end of the Siege of Leningrad, during which more than 800,000 people perished from hunger as they repelled Hitler's onslaught.

Another channel, privately-run TV Rain, outraged viewers - especially the elderly - in a separate incident with a phone-in on whether Leningrad, now St Petersburg, should have surrendered to the Nazis.

The channel  issued an immediate apology, saying it had not intended to offend veterans.

Attempts to whitewash the Nazis often provoke understandable anger in the former Soviet Union, a country which saw the loss of up to 27 million in the Second World War.
