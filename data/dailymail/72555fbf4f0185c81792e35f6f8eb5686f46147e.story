A teenage couple from Colorado accused of murdering the boy's grandfather, and killing and dismembering his grandmother, allegedly planned the grisly crime so he could collect his inheritance.

Brendan Johnson, 19, and 18-year-old Cassandra Rieb appeared in court Wednesday in Sterling, a small city on Colorado's rural northeastern plains 110 miles northeast of Denver, a day after they were arrested in the deaths of Charles and Shirley Severance, both 70.

Arrest affidavits show both teens told police they planned to kill Johnson's grandparents by smothering them with pillows as they slept. Police say Rieb told them Johnson wanted to inherit their house and $20,000 from their checking account.

Crime scene: Police performing a welfare check found Charles Severance's body inside his Sterling, Colorado, home nine days after the murder

Police say the teens dumped some of Shirley Severance's remains at a a reservoir near Sterling and others about 30 miles away across the state line in Lorenzo, Nebraska. Police discovered Charles Severance's body in his home last week.

The teenage couple are being held without bond in the Logan County jail on suspicion of first-degree murder as well as felony robbery, theft and forgery charges.

Victim: Shirley Severance, 70, was stabbed multiple times, strangled to death with a string, burned and dismembered

‘These are the charges they are being held on and not necessarily the formal charges,’ Sterling Police Chief Tyson Kerr said in a statement. ‘In addition, some of these charges may be filed as crimes against an at-risk adult.’

Kerr said an autopsy will be performed on Shirley Severence this week. Police have not revealed the full autopsy results for her husband, only saying that the body did not exhibit signs of trauma or injury. 

The body of Charles Severance was discovered in his home in the 400 block of South Third Avenue May 29 after Brendan Johnson contacted police asking them to perform a welfare check.

According to court documents, following their arrest the couple admitted that they had begun planning the murders in early May.

‘We had agreed to do it together; Obviously… like one get one and the other get the other one,’ Cassandra Reib was allegedly quoted as saying in the affidavit obtained by The Denver Channel.

According to the document, Rieb told investigators Shirley Severance offered her and her grandson money, but the pair stabbed and strangled the woman to death anyway. 

Johnson allegedly said he and Rieb entered his grandparents’ Sterling home May 20. The plan was that he would strangle his grandfather and Rieb would attack his grandmother.

The 70-year-old Mr Severance put up a fight, and Johnson told police he believed the elderly man ultimately died of a heart attack.

Confession, Rieb, 18, told police the plan was for her to kill Shirley Severance while her boyfriend attacked his grandfather

Motive: Police say the Walmart worker wanted to inherit $20,000 and his grandparents' home

In the meantime, his girlfriend confronted Shirley Severance, who offered the couple money, but the 18-year-old tried to strangle her.

The woman’s grandson attempted to slit her throat, but missed and cut her jaw. Mrs Severance tried to flee, but Johnson pulled her back into the house and stabbed her multiple times before strangling her with a string.

Before she died, Shirley Severance reportedly asked her attackers, ‘Why are you doing this to me,’ according to Rieb. Johnson allegedly responded, ‘You know why.’

The couple escaped in Charles Severance’ truck after Johnson allegedly wrote out two fake checks and forged his grandfather’s signature. It was not until nine days later that Brendan Johnson called police.

In the meantime, the 19-year-old Walmart employee used the stolen vehicle to go to a concert in Denver and to dispose of his grandmother's corpse.

To cover up the evidence, the couple burned and buried the 70-year-old woman's body in two separate locations.

Johnson revealed during questioning that after he doused his grandmother’s body with gasoline and lit it on fire at a reservoir near Sterling, he tried to hack off an arm and a leg.

The pair came back to collect the scorched remains buried in a fire pit a few days later, but could not get to them because there were people camping in the area.

They made a third trip to the reservoir May 28, at which time they dug up the body and re-interred it in Nebraska.

Johnson and Rieb are due back in court June 18. If convicted, they could face life without parole or the death penalty.
