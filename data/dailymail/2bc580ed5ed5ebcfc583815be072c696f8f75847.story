A man who allegedly stole a woman's phone just seconds after she was fatally struck by a subway train had 'no criminal intent' in taking the device, his lawyer has claimed.

Josue Gonzalez, 26, was caught on surveillance video covering his mouth in shock as the train smashed into the victim at Boston's Downtown Crossing station last Thursday night.

But as he did so, he positioned his foot over the woman's cellphone - enclosed in an orange case - which had flown out of her purse and landed on the platform on impact.

According to prosecutors, Gonzalez, from Brockton, Massachusetts, covered the phone with his foot, before looking around to see if anyone was watching in a deliberate attempt to steal the item.

But now, the defendant's attorney has said his client did not mean to break the law and there was 'no criminal intent' behind his actions at around 9.50pm last Thursday.

Gonzalez, who works for an International House of Pancakes restaurant, appeared at Boston Municipal Court on Monday, where he pleaded not guilty to larceny charges.

Donning sunglasses and a hat, he said nothing to reporters as he was released on personal recognizance, according to The Boston Globe. 

Following the fatal collision, Transit Police released the shocking footage of Gonzalez from the station's surveillance cameras, asking the public for help in identifying the suspect. 

The video quickly went viral online, with many social media users condemning the man for his 'heartless' and 'sly' actions, WCVB reported. 

Last week, Lieutenant Richard Sullivan said: 'Ninety-nine percent of all of the other people were concerned about what happened, running to the end of the train to see if they could help.
