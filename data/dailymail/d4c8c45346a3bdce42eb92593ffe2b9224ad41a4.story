A benefits cheat who stole almost 26,000 by claiming he could barely walk was caught after investigators filmed him jogging and kicking debris while working as a race track marshall.

Anthony Carter, 60, was first granted disability living allowance as a result of his arthritis and hip problems.

He recently told authorities he needed a walking stick to get around - but a court heard how his physical condition had improved by 2006 following a hip operation.

Benefits cheat: Anthony Carter continued to claim thousands of pounds in disability allowance - claiming that he was barely able to walk - despite his physical condition improving in 2006 following a hip operation

Investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) launched a surveillance operation into Carter after receiving a tip-off about his scam.

They discovered he was carrying out voluntary work as a race track marshal and attending several meetings a year in Derbyshire.

Video footage captured by undercover investigators showed Carter walking along the race track, kicking at debris and jogging.

Scam: The benefits cheat illegally claimed almost £26,000 in disability allowance from 2006 to 2013

He was also spotted holding a large flag and waving it when necessary at the racing events.

A court heard the fraudster was overpaid £25,925 in disability living allowance between March 2006 and August last year.

Carter, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances affecting entitlement to benefit.

But he was spared jail and was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday.

Judge Peter Barrie told Carter it was public money and said he had a responsibility to notify the authorities of a change in any circumstances.

He said: 'You had a hip replacement operation and got much better.

'In 2006 you were able to be active working as a volunteer race marshal and clearly at that point not entitled to receive these benefits.

'It is a serious form of fraud.'

Carter was also ordered to pay back the entire amount he fraudulently claimed between March 2006 and August 2013.

Prosecutor Nicholas Berry said Carter admitted his role during interviews and told the DWP his main duty was to stand at a designated part of the track.

But video footage played in court shows the fraudster dressed in bright orange overalls jogging alongside the track as go-karts speed past nearby.

He can also be seen standing in a cage waving a giant yellow flag in the 1..07-minute video which was filmed in September 2012.

Samantha Powis, defending, said Carter had been a hardworking man until his physical difficulties and the claim began legitimately.

She added: 'He's unlikely to ever trouble the courts again.

'He's very concerned. He's very frightened.'

Speaking after the case, Sian Fellowes, a DWP fraud manager in the West Midlands, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.

'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'
