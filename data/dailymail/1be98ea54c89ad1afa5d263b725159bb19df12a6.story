Police in Toronto are still looking for the man who attacked an elderly woman last weekend, severing her nose. Yesterday, they asked for the public's help in identifying two men who might be able to aid in the investigation.

A 76-year-old woman had just gotten off a street car at Yonge-Dundas Square around 2pm Saturday when a man got into the same elevator as her.

The stranger brandished a weapon before slicing off part of her nose and fleeing.

According to Detective Constable 
Gianni Filippin, the attack was unprovoked and there wasn't any 
indication that the man was trying to rob her.

'It was just a random attack,' he told the Toronto Star.

On Thursday, police in Toronto released images of two men they say may be able to 'assist with this investigation.'

Who did this? Police say they want to speak to the two men to ask them if they heard anything or saw anything related to the attack

According to Constable Wendy Drummond, the two men in the surveillance images were in the vicinity at the time of the attack.

'We just want to speak to them to see if they have any information. If they heard anything, saw anything,' she told the National Post.

Police are currently looking for a suspect described as a man 40 to 60 years old, and between five-foot-six and five-foot-eight.

The elderly woman who was attacked is still recovering from her injuries but doctors were able to reattach the portion of her nose that was cut off.
