Tensions between Japan and China escalated further today after thousands of Chinese protesters took to the streets and overturned Japanese cars.

The demonstrations were the latest in an ongoing feud between the two countries over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.

Chinese protesters denounced Japan's claims to the islands - which are known as the Diaoyu in China and as the Senkaku in Japan.

Tokyo responded by urging China to protect Japanese citizens.

The demonstrations came after 10 Japanese nationalists swam to the islands on Sunday in a tit-for-tat move following a similar landing by Chinese activists last week.

Both China’s government and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda are under domestic pressure to take a tough stance over the islands.

But economic ties between the two countries are deeper than ever, and both are thought to be keen to prevent the feud spiralling out of control.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said that they were anxious to contain the situation.

'We would like to continue to deepen mutually beneficial relations between Japan and China, keeping a broader perspective in mind,' he said.

'Regarding the protests in China, we are asking, above all, to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals (in China).'

The anti-Japanese protests in part reflect bitter Chinese memories of Japan’s occupation of large parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s.

Chinese mainstream media were critical of Japan, but some also suggested that violent protest was not the way to proceed.

'Japan has made a series of mistakes 
in the Diaoyu Island issue, and has hurt the Chinese people’s feelings,'
said the China Youth Daily.

'The
young people’s patriotism is laudable ... but for a selected number of 
those who are smashing their fellows’ vehicles, damaging public 
property-that shows foolishness.

'This severely disrupts social order, injures the cities’ image, and furthermore, affected China’s image.'

Japan, eager to keep the feud from escalating, deported the Chinese activists within days but the fate of the Japanese protesters remains undecided.
