Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been thrown a lifeline by Australian voters just as his internal opponents appeared ready to dump him, with the latest opinion poll confirming a pro-government shift is under way.

The Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday puts the coalition almost neck-and-neck with Labor in two-party terms at 49-51.

That's the best result since October and a big improvement on the 54-46 split recorded in January.

As speculation about Tony Abbott's leadership rumbles on, a Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday puts the coalition almost neck-and-neck with Labor in two-party terms at 49-51

Labor's primary vote dropped four points to sit at 36 per cent, while the Coalition gained four points to hit 42 per cent, according to the poll of 1,406 voters.

The results confirm a surge in government support suggested last week by Newspoll, which found primary support for the government rising three points.

Yet Mr Abbott continues to lag behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull as preferred leader of the Liberal Party, with the latter scoring highter in all of 10 leadership attributes voters were surveyed about.

Just one fifth of those polled believe Mr Abbott enjoys the confidence of his party. Half think Mr Turnbull does.

Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten remains the preferred prime minister compared to Mr Abbott, but his margin has been slashed from 16 points to five since the previous poll to sit at 44-39.

On sunday, Mr Abbott laughed off the latest round of leadership talk as recycled rubbish, saying the matter was settled by the failure of a spill motion in the Liberals' party room three weeks ago.

But talk of a second spill motion this week persists, after reports a majority of Liberal MPs and senators now want to dump him. 

A relaxed Mr Abbott poked fun at the leadership rumours at a Clean Up Australia Day event on NSW's south coast on Sunday.

'This is Clean Up Australia Day, and I'm just not going to do anything but recycle the rubbish,' he joked.

'And that's what's happening, we're just recycling rubbish today.'

A party room spill motion three weeks ago was defeated 61-39, and the coalition was getting on with governing, Mr Abbott said.

'Frankly I think the people of Australia are sick of the insider obsessions of people in Canberra,' he told reporters.

Prospective leadership contenders Julie Bishop and Mr Turnbull steered clear of the speculation, with both declaring their support for Mr Abbott.

Mr Turnbull said it was 'absolutely critical' Liberals concentrated on defeating Labor at this month's NSW election.

'The big political question in the next four weeks is the NSW state election,' he told reporters on his Sunday morning walk in Sydney.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull both threw their support behind Mr Abbott on Sunday following the latest opinion poll

'The prime minister has my support. He has the support of the Cabinet and life goes on.'

Ms Bishop dismissed the continued rumblings as hypothetical, after News Corp reported the foreign minister would put her hand up in the event of a spill.

'The prime minister has not been challenged. There was a spill motion that didn't succeed, and what we're doing is focusing on governing,' she told Network Ten.
