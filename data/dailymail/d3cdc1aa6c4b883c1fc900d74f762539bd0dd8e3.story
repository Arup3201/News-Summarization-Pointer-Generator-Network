For some, drones represent a frightening future where people will be constantly surveyed.

But one startup thinks small, unmanned aircraft should be seen as approachable and has even positioned them as flying pets that can be taken for a walk on a leash.

There are strict rules governing where drones can be used and by whom, but keeping a drone on its lead could side step safety and some privacy concerns.

Fast: Fotokite is built to be launched and fully operational in under one  minute, unlike more complex drones which take time to check and calibrate.

Easy to navigate: The drone does not rely on trained operators, GPS or sophisticated sensing for controlled flight. To the user, flying the camera is as simple as holding a kite, and framing the picture is as easy as rotating your hand-held monitor. 

Accountable and safe: Existing drones can be difficult to manoeuvre in windy conditions and can be dangerous. The Fotokite's tether provides a safer way to fly and allows close-proximity operations. The tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners, the company said.

Rule-abiding: The drone can be regulated as a kite under FAA UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) guidelines.

Fotokite is a small quadrocopter that is compact and simple – designed to be used by people for taking aerial photographs of places and events such as family parties and weddings.

It does not rely on GPS, machine vision or even a compass for navigation, which should decrease the chances of crashes.

Sergei Lupashin, the Zurich-based roboticist behind the innovation, told the BBC: ‘Should something happen, the leash gives a robust fail safe - the vehicle reduces thrust and it automatically comes back to the operator.’

Unlike more complex ‘professional’ drones, the Fotokite prototype can be launched and working in under one minute and can be flown by people with no experience of operating complicated systems, radios and complicated aircraft.

The company says: ‘To the user, flying the camera is as simple as holding a kite, and framing the picture is as easy as rotating your hand-held monitor.’

Fotokite also claims to be easier to manoeuvre than more complex drones, which can be dangerous if they get close to buildings in windy conditions.

‘The Fotokite's tether provides a safer, more direct way to fly. It enables close-proximity operations and the tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners,’ the start-up said.

Dr Lupashin told MailOnline: 'We are passionate about making aerial photography safer and more accessible to everyone.'

Importantly, because the aircraft is tethered to a leash, it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones, the company claims.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said operating
rules for standard Unmanned Aircraft (UAVs) include:

They must never be flown beyond the
normal unaided ‘line of sight’ of the person operating them. This is generally
measured as 1,640ft (500m) horizontally or 400ft (122m) vertically.

 An
unmanned aircraft fitted with a camera must always be flown at least 164ft (50m)
distance away from a person, vehicle, building or structure.

An unmanned
aircraft fitted with a camera must not be flown within 492ft (150m) of a
congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert.

Consideration
must be shown to other airspace users. Therefore unmanned aircraft should not
be used in the vicinity of airports or within restricted airspace.

Commercial
 drones are banned in the U.S. and there are laws banning their flight 
within close proximity of people, buildings and bridges for example in the UK.

Ben Gielow, general counsel for the Association
for Unmanned Vehicles Systems Internet is unsure whether the leash would bypass such laws.

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority told MailOnline that it is difficult to know whether the aircraft would fall within current rules and regulations without knowing more about where it would be flown and other specifics.

Dr Lupashin was inspired to create the drone on a 
leash during street protests in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow when he 
realised how useful an aerial perspective would be for journalists 
reporting the event.

But the idea evolved in an unlikely direction and Dr Lupashin saw potential for the technology to be used as a toy as well as by photographers, archaeologists and architects.

He has created a prototype of the ‘pet’ drone based heavily on a quadrocopter he bought from a shop, which he demonstrated at the recent TED conference using a leash for a small dog.

His device can shoot video as well as take photos and he thinks that while people fear military drones and large unmanned vehicles flying high above them, they will be less suspicious of a flying camera on a leash used by normal people.

He said: ‘People treat you normally - it is like a flying pet. It always has a physical connection to the operator’.

There is no launch date or price for the drone yet, but it will be available to pre-order 'soon'.

Safe: Because the aircraft is tethered to a leash, it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones, the company claims. Here, the drones are demonstrated at the recent TED conference
