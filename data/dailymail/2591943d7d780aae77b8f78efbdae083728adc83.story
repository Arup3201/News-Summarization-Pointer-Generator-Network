The case of Felix Garcia - a deaf man serving a life sentence for a murder he says his brother framed him for - took an unexpected turn this week when a third brother arrived in court to say both his siblings are guilty.

Garcia's supporters insist he did not receive a fair trial in the 1981 murder-robbery of Joseph Tramontana, Jr. in Tampa, Florida, for which both he and his brother Frank are imprisoned. 

At a parole hearing yesterday, the board decided to move up Felix Garcia's potential parole date by one year, to 2025. He will get another hearing in three years.

They did not move up the date for brother Frank Garcia, who is serving a 99-year sentence with a potential 2026 release date. His case will be reheard in seven years.

The third brother, Mike Garcia, and sister Tina Daniels spoke at the hearing only in the proceeding for Frank Garcia.

'You know your family members - when they're telling the truth and when they're not telling you the truth,' Mike Garcia said. 

'People can bull crap, I understand that. People are con artists, I understand that. I know my brother Frank. I know my brother Felix. I know Francisco Garcia did not pull that trigger.'

A commission member asked if that meant Felix participated. 'Yes. Yes, they were both there at that time,' Mike Garcia answered.

After the hearing, he told reporters that he believed Felix is the person who killed Tramontana Jr.

'That's what I've heard over the years. I wasn't there,' he said. 'I know my brothers, and that's it. ' 

Mike Garcia's account is a vastly different story than lawyers presented. 

They said Felix Garcia had two witnesses placing him six miles away from the motel where the murder happened.

The lawyers insist Frank Garcia, his sister, Tina, and her boyfriend, Ray Stanley participated in the crime and framed Felix.

They say Frank Garcia gave Felix the victim's ring to sell, and the pawn shop slip tied him to the crime.

Neither the sister nor Stanley was charged, and Stanley has since died.

Frank Garcia later admitted Felix wasn't involved in the murder, the lawyers also said. 

Although Felix Garcia was given a hearing aid, and a courtroom speaker was turned up,  lawyers say he still could not understand the proceedings at the murder trial.

'He is totally innocent,' lawyer Reggie Garcia, who isn't related to the brothers, said. 'Felix Garcia has an alibi before, during and after the murder.'

But prosecutor Mark Ober said the affidavit Frank Garcia signed on behalf of Felix was part of a plot to get his brother out so he could sue the state and then help seek Frank's release.

After the hearing, Pat Bliss - an attorney who has fought for 18 years on Felix' behalf - approached his siblings and said she was shocked they did not speak for him, too. 'He never asked us,' Ms Daniels said.

'He feels like he's been deserted by his family,' Ms Bliss responded.
