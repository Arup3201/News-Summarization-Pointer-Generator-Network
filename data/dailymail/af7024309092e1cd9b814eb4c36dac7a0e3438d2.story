The Missouri church attended by Michael Brown’s father and his family was one of a dozen or so buildings burned to the ground during Monday night’s protests in the wake of a grand jury’s decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson. 

While the majority of the buildings destroyed on Monday were in downtown Ferguson, the Flood Christian Church is located some three miles away from the protests in a remote section of Country Club Hills.

Pastor Carlton Lee, who has been a vocal advocate for the Browns since their son was shot in August, has said he believes that white supremacists rather than protesters were to blame for the destruction.

What's more, this all happened just one day after Michael Brown Sr. was baptized, attending a service at Flood Christian Church and then undergoing the actual religious rite at the nearby West Calvary Mission Baptist Church.

Brown was joined by his wife, Cal, and their children for his baptism on Sunday.

'It's just been so much stuff going on, we haven't had a chance to do it,' said Michael Sr. 

'After all the stuff that's been happening, we have to keep doing positive things...it's just something we needed to do for our family.' 

Rev. Lee told NBC News that he believes Flood church was targeted because he has repeatedly called for the arrest of Officer Wilson.

'I'm very vocal in regards to the Michael Brown case,' said Lee, who has participated in rallies and press conferences with Michael Brown Sr. and claims to have received 71 death threats. 

'The police called me and told me the church was on fire,' Lee said. 'I was in complete disbelief. I didn't think anyone would set a church on fire. 

'I feel like one of my children has died. I put my blood, my sweat, my tears into this church, getting this church built from the ground up. 

'To see that it was taken down in a few minutes is really heartbreaking.' 

Rev. Lee said Michael Brown Sr. was 'just devastated again' about the extensive damage. 

He then brought up how close it happened to Brown Sr.'s baptism.

'Sunday, we do the baptism, Monday, the church is one fire. It just doesn't add up.'

He suspects his church was targeted by white supremacists who wanted to punish him for his support of the Brown family.

Pastor Lee told Mail Online that he had known the Brown family for several years after officiating at their wedding. He said he remembered Michael Jr. as a ‘big jokester.’

‘He was a fun loving guy to be around,’ he recalled.

On Sunday Lee had baptized Michael Brown Sr, his wife, Cal, and their children.

The event, which had taken place at a different church, had been planned months ago and Michael Jr. was supposed to be there, too. 

'Sunday, we do the baptism, Monday, the church is one fire. It just doesn't add up,' he said.

He said Brown had pledged his help in repairing the damage to the storefront church that was once an automotive shop. The building and been a non-denominational church since February 2013.

'We rebuild,' Lee said. 'We do not stop.'
