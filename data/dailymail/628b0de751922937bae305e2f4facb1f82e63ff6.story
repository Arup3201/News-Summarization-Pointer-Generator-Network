Dallas Animal Services has sparked outrage  after putting down four dogs earlier this year, dogs that members of the community say were handed over by their owner in hopes that they would find new homes. 

On December 30, 27 dogs were taken from a potential animal hoarder by the shelter with the permission of the owner and, according to reports, it was agreed that they would be kept until homes could be found for them.

On New Year's Day however, four of the animals were euthanized.

Tragedy: Four dogs (onse above) were euthanized by Dallas Animal Services on New Year's Day

Big haul: The four (one above) were part of 27 brought in in hopes of finding new homes before the winter weather set in

Deeply upset: Marina Tarashevska (above) is one of the women who helped get the animals from the owner to the shelter with the promise that homes would be found

'These dogs just looked at us like, "Please help." And so we were trying to help them,' Deborah Whittington, who worked with fellow resident Marina Tarashevska on rescuing the dogs, told NBC 5. 

She said that the dogs were supposed to spend 10 days in the shelter while they tried to find homes for the animals before they would consider putting them down, something that a worker there assured them of when they were brought in.

'I don't think that the left hand always knows what the right hand is doing, and I feel like they have betrayed the trust of the community,' said Whittington.

Sana Syed, public information director for the City of Dallas, said the workers at Animal Servies are just as upset about what has happened.

'To know that four dogs may have been euthanized in error has devastated staff, and they are also eager to look for ways to prevent incidents like this in the future,' she said in a statement.

Angry: Deborah Whittington (above) who also worked on the rescue team says she is frustrated with the shelter

Bad circumstances: The four dogs (one above) were living with what many believe was a serial animal hoarder

Bad conditions: The dogs (onse above) were in very small cages and outdoors, and had been named Faith, Hope, Love and Grace

It is still not entirely what clear what did happen, but the city did release a statement about the incident.

'On Tuesday, Dec. 30, Dallas Animal Services officers picked up four dogs. The owner gave the dogs to DAS in hopes of finding them a new home. They ranged in age from about one to eight-years old. The officers took the animals to the City shelter, where they were entered into the system as “owner surrenders,"' began the statement. 

'Two days later, on Jan. 1, all four dogs were euthanized by DAS staff based on their health and behavior.'

Diggin in: The city said it is launching an investigation into what happened at the shelter (above) and will share what it finds 

An investigation is under way, one made even worse by the fact that on January 5, well before the 10 day deadline, homes were found for the four dogs.

The city said it will share its findings once the investigation is complete. 

The 27 dogs had been sharing small, outdoor pens when they were found by Tarashevska, Whittington and their team, who wanted to make sure they got indoors before the cold weather hit and therefore reached out to Dallas Animal Services. 

They had named the dogs Faith, Hope, Love and Grace.
