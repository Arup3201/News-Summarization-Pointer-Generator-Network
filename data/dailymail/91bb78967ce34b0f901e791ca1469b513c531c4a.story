Wendy Davis has reassured her supporters their campaign was not fought in vain as she conceded defeat on stage alongside her mother who almost killed her when she was a child.

Davis, who broke down in tears as she gave her concession speech, had earlier called Republican Greg Abbot to congratulate him on his landslide victory.

She told supporters at the Davis campaign's Forth Worth election party they must continue fighting despite a landslide victory for her Republican opponent Greg Abbot.

She said: 'This wasn't just a campaign for the governor's seat, this was a fight to ensure the state belongs to you,' reported Kera News.

'The only way we will have lost tonight is if we stop fighting. I am so proud of all that we have accomplished.'

Davis took to the stage flanked by her daughters and mother. Two months ago the Democrat publicly revealed her mother attempted to kill her and siblings when they were children by putting them in the trunk of her car.

The 51-year-old explained her mother was battling depression after her divorce and was struggling as a young single parent with three children under the age of five.

Lost in the noise of Tuesday's U.S. Senate elections is a second potential landslide, with Republicans threatening to reassert their dominance over governor's mansions in a large majority of states.

The marquee matchup in Texas pitted Greg Abbott, the paraplegic state Attorney General, against state Sen. Wendy Davis, a freshly minted feminist icon known for filibustering an anti-abortion bill in pink sneakers.

Abbott had pulled away in recent days, enlarging a 6-point lead to an 18-point spread in the last two weeks – since Davis ran a controversial TV ad making a wheelchair the center of attention - and ended up winning big on Tuesday, despite reports that he failed to even make the ballot in one town.

Accusations surfaced Tuesday afternoon that in the Lone Star State's third-most populous county, Abbott's name isn't on at least one touch-screen ballot machine. Instead, an Instagram photo of a Bexar County machine shows, the Republican slot is taken by David Dewhurst, the 2012 failed GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. 

Logan Churchwell, communications director at the conservative True the Vote organization, told MailOnline that his group had confirmed Bexar County has received 'additional complaints' and that 'they are currently investigating how widespread the matter is.'

'Unlike voting machine calibration issues that may switch votes,' he explained, 'this appears to be a data-entry error when preparing the digital ballots.'

'I think it's a photoshopped deal but we are checking,' Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen told the San Antonio Express-News. 

The image, which shows clunky block-like sections of the video template out of place, could reflect a ham-fisted Photoshop attempt, a Republican campaign consultant in Washington told MailOnline. 

'Or,' he said, 'it could be that the voting machine's software is messed up. If it's pulling in candidates from two years ago, who knows what else is wrong in those computers?'

The campaign operative insisted, though, that Abbott would win Tuesday.

An alert Bexar County, Texas voter snapped this picture of a voting machine that omitted the name of GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, substituting 2012 failed lieutenant governor hopeful David Dewhurst instead

'Not even the Democratic Party could buy enough votes or stuff enough ballot boxes to save Wendy Davis at this point,' he said.

WOAI reporter Jocelyn Tovar posted the Instagram photo after she interviewed the woman who snapped it. It's unclear how that voter could have edited the image so fast, and without leaving the polling place.

'I don't have time for that,' the woman told her. Tovar posted a second photo on Twitter, showing the same kind of digital goof.

It's also unclear how many votes for Dewhurst were recorded before the machine was taken out of service. Election officials said there's not much they can do about it, and Texas election law prohibits them from assigning his votes to Abbot. 

Far less Election Day controversy chased candidates in Maryland, Florida, Wisconsin and other states – 36 in all – that are choosing chief executives on Tuesday.

About 14 of those races are rated as toss-ups. In 14 states overall, Democrats appear to be safely in control either because the races are runaways or because they're not contested this year. That number pales next to the 22 states that Republicans can easily count on running when the rust settles.

SENDING HIM PACKING? Wisconsin Democrat Mary Burke failed to end the rule of Gov. Scott Walker, even though she got some help from Pres. Obama

Gov. Walker has attracted scorn and tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from angry labor unions, but still could  not be stopped

BY A HAIR'S BREADTH? Anthony Brown (right) is Maryland's lieutenant governor, and Michelle Obama wanted him to get the top job

In Wisconsin, organized labor arch-enemy Scott Walker's lead was within the polling margin of error against Democrat Mary Burke, but he still pulled of a rather large victory in the state. 

Barack Obama has campaigned there for Burke personally, making her one of few politicians who welcomed the unpopular president's help.

Walker is loathed on the political left for trimming the sails of the state's powerful unions, but he survived a nasty recall effort and has presided over an economic program that added jobs, cut deficits and grew the state economy dramatically.

Maryland ultimately provided the upset of the night as businessman Larry Hogan defeated Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, an African-American whose failure to win the top job could be seen as a repudiation of his boss, Gov. Martin O'Maalley.

O'Malley is a likely presidential candidate in 2016, and handing the governor's mansion keys to a Republican will likely hurt his standing immeasurably.
