Jodi Arias' effort to raise money for her legal team has offended many involved in the murder trial, but now new revelations about her creative subjects are shocking her ex-boyfriend's family.

Old drawings that the accused murderer made while in jail show a noticeable similarity to her victim Travis Alexander's sister.

In one series called 'The Hat', the female subject looks just like Alexander's sister Tanisha Sorenson, who followers of the case are familiar with because she has been sitting in the court room the entire length of the death penalty trial.

Who's that girl: Court watchers have said that there are distinct similarities between the women in some of Jodi Arias' drawings and her slain ex-boyfriend's sister Tanisha Sorenson

Killer turned artist: Arias has been seen sketching throughout the lengthy trial, and she has been selling the art online to raise money for her legal expenses

Supporters of Travis Alexander's family found the pencil drawing that Arias allegedly made while behind bars for the brutal killing of her 30-year-old ex, who was found dead in his home after being stabbed 29 times and shot.

This black and white drawing is not one of the ones that Arias and her supporters have been selling online in order to help pay for her legal team and her family's expenses while staying in Phoenix, Arizona for the trial.

Though 'The Hat' series has not been put up for sale, her other drawings-featuring famous stars of yesteryear like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly as well as a number of reportedly anonymous subjects- have fetched thousands for her cause.

The likeness between the woman in 'The Hat' and Tanisha Sorenson is striking, with the two sharing similar eyes and lip shapes.

Eery: Supporters of Alexander's family noticed the similarities between the two, and because the drawings were made before the trial, that hints that Arias has been thinking of Alexander's sister for years

Ms Sorenson has been a constant presence in the Phoenix courtroom, sitting alongside one of Travis' good friends and their other sister. At one point during Arias' testimony about her sexual exploits with Alexander, Ms Sorenson visibly rolled her eyes.

'I know this might sound creepy, but I hope to get to watch her die someday after she’s on death row,' Ms Sorenson told HLN during an earlier interview.

'Even if it’s in 20 years from now, the death penalty is what she deserves, though she most likely won’t get it and instead will get some life sentence.'

The Hat is not listed as being for sale, but the site, run by Arias' friends outside of prison, continues to list other drawings.

Just today they added an earlier piece of art that the suspected murderer made of an unidentified woman holding a blue pill between her teeth.

Due to apparent popular demand, they've also announced that they will be selling 100 limited edition reprints of her picture of an hourglass.

Four other pieces that have already been sold all went for $1,000 or more, with her portrait of Grace Kelly earning a whopping $3,050.

The drama surrounding the case continues in the courtroom as well, as one of Alexander's ex-girlfriends took the stand on Tuesday.

Deanna Reid, who dated Alexander 
before he dated Arias, and prosecutor Juan Martinez tried to have her 
testimony go against that of the defense which asserts that Arias was 
physically abused and mentally manipulated by Alexander.  

The
defense rested their case last week but they are asking to add another 
witness after a prosecution expert told jurors that Arias suffered from 
borderline personality disorder.

The
expert, clinical psychologist Janeen DeMarte, told the court that Arias
does not suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or amnesia as her 
lawyers have claimed.
