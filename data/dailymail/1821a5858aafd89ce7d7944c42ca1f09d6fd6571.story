This is the horrifying moment a drunk driver ploughed into a pub at 60mph just seconds after a group of customers had been standing in the doorway.

Problem drinker Leigh Brennan, 45, had already injured two others after crashing into a Mini before speeding off from the scene and in his Volvo estate car.

He lost control again and smashed into the Three Elms in Brixham, Devon, leaving the landlord Kevin O'Neill seriously injured under a pile of rubble.

Devon and Cornwall police have released the shocking CCTV footage in a bid to warn motorists of the dangers of drink driving in the run up to Christmas.

The pub's pool team had been stood outside smoking shortly before the car careered into the doorway head on.

Dangerous: Leigh Brennan, 45, smashed into the front of the Three Elms pub in Devon at 60mph while drunk behind the wheel

Landlord Kevin O'Neil was left with a crushed pelvis, broken ribs and spinal injuries after rescuers dug him out from underneath the bricks by hand.

He spent three days in intensive care and required three operations.

Brennan staggered out of his car and shouted abuse at those who tried to help and police when they arrived.

He refused to give a breath or blood sample but witnesses said he was clearly drunk.

He was jailed for 12 months and banned from driving for two years after admitting dangerous driving at Exeter Crown Court following the incident in March this year.

Speaking yesterday, Mr O'Neil said: 'I was seriously ill. I was 
in intensive care for three days and had three operations for a broken 
pelvis, three vertebrae in my spine, broken ribs, skin grafts and my 
heart went out of sync which was down to the shock. The price of a taxi is the price of a pint.' 

Inspector Richard Pryce, head of 
Devon and Cornwall police roads policing said: 'The devastation caused 
by drink driving can be seen clearly in the CCTV footage.

Rubble: The damage caused after Brennan ploughed into the Three Elms pub in Devon in March this year

Injuries: Landlord Kevin O'Neil had to have three operations following the crash after he suffered a crushed pelvis, broken ribs and spinal injuries

'There was a group of people stood 
outside the pub just moments before the crash and it is a miracle that 
no-one was killed and only one person was injured.

'The number of people who are killed 
or seriously injured by a driver who is under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs is much too high and can be reduced.

'If you drink and drive your chances of getting caught by police are high and the consequences are life changing.

'As well as the potentially tragic 
consequences, someone who is caught drink driving faces losing their 
livelihood, a driving ban, a hefty fine or spending time in prison.'
