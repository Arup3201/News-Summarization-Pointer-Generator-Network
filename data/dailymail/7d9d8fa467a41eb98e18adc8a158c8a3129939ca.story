With the door to the steam room shut at his Ascot home, Boris Berezovsky liked to retreat from the stresses of being a sworn enemy of Vladimir Putin, the former KGB man he bankrolled to become Russia’s president.

But it was in this sanctuary that his body was found on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death.

Once such good friends that Berezovsky spent millions creating a political party for Putin, the pair fell out spectacularly in 2000, prompting the Russian leader’s supposed ‘godfather’ to flee to Britain.

Unanswered questions: Boris Berezovsky's body was found at his estate in Ascot on Saturday, a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death

Suggestions that Berezovsky, pictured with his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova and their dog, Sim, had committed suicide were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire's friends and business associates

Yet even after escaping Moscow and moving into the former home of TV star Chris Evans, replete with hi-tech security systems as well as underground car parking, sauna and swimming pool, Berezovsky did not feel safe.

Surrounded by teams of Russian security men, and with a personal bodyguard alongside him 24 hours a day, he was convinced his Kremlin enemies would track him down and kill him, even after he moved two years ago to a new property in Berkshire.

Yesterday, suggestions that Berezovsky had committed suicide – as reported widely by the Russian media – were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire’s friends and business associates.

‘Boris was a fighter, and suicide was just not in his DNA,’ said Dr Yuri Felshtinsky, a close friend.

'Boris was looking to the future and did not seem to be suicidal. We spoke about his daughter.

‘Boris feared for his safety, and understood that the Kremlin aimed to destroy him as an example for anyone else who opposed them. He understood the Kremlin mindset better than anyone.’

Andrei Sidelnikov, a Berezovsky supporter given political asylum by Britain for his opposition to Putin, was emphatic. ‘Such a person could never commit suicide,’ he said. ‘He was an exceptionally lively person and, despite his various setbacks in life, always remained so.’

The discovery of Berezovsky's body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire, Badri Patarkatsishvili (pictured), who he joined forces with to put Putin into power

Demyan Kudryavtsev, another Russian emigre and friend of the dead billionaire, also dismissed speculation that Berezovsky had killed himself: ‘No, it’s wrong. There are no exterior signs of suicide, no traces of a syringe, no signs that he could have taken some pills.’

Even more disturbing, the discovery of Berezovsky’s body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire he joined forces with to put Putin into power – and who also later fell out spectacularly with the Russian leader.

Badri Patarkatsishvili, a businessman and politician, was found dead at the Surrey mansion he owned, not far from Berezovsky’s former home, in 2008. Police, who initially described the death as ‘suspicious’, tested for radiation poisoning, but no traces were found.

Along with Berezovsky, the dead man had helped bankroll Putin’s rise to the Kremlin, but had later clashed with associates of the country’s president as rival sides battled for control of Russia’s assets.

No doubt: Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin

Shortly before his death, the 52-year-old had spoken of an assassination plot, claiming that a hit squad of four Georgians had been sent by the Kremlin to London ‘to do something against me’, while secret tapes of a conversation between a Russian official and a Chechen hitman emerged in which they discussed how to make him ‘disappear completely’.

Experts say that, as well as deadly substances such as ricin and polonium, a favoured method for despatching enemies of Russia is poisoning with sodium fluoroacetate, a chemical used in pesticides that causes heart failure when ingested in tiny amounts, with the cause of death notoriously difficult to establish. If Patarkatsishvili was assassinated, could the long arm of the Russian leadership have reached out to an enemy in the Home Counties again?

There is no doubt Berezovsky was hated in the Kremlin. Yet it would be a grim end indeed for a man who was once a model Soviet citizen.

Born in Moscow in 1946 to a Jewish civil engineer father and housewife mother, he was studious at school and sufficiently gifted at mathematics to join the Soviet Union’s Academy of Sciences.

But the collapse of communism helped propel him from academia to the pinnacle of one of the most ruthless and violent business environments on Earth: post-Soviet Russia. As the Soviet empire crumbled and gang wars erupted, Berezovsky decided to go into business and forged a relationship with AvtoVAZ, producer of the Lada car.

To protect his fortune, Berezovsky forged ties with Chechen gangsters – some of the most feared people in Russia. The graveyards of Russia are full of dead businessmen from the 1990s, and Berezovsky almost joined them: he faced a gun battle in central Moscow in 1994, and a year later the Mercedes he was in was blown up, decapitating his driver.

But with nerves of steel, Berezovsky went for broke: he paid for the publication of President Boris Yeltsin’s memoirs, securing him the goodwill of Russia’s then leader. The political clout this gave him offered access to the national airline Aeroflot, and then to Russia’s massive oil reserves.

Rewarded with a seat on Yeltsin’s national Security Council, he helped implement the peace deal that ended Russia’s first war with rebels in the Chechnya region, and was seen as a figure of almost Rasputin-like influence.

As Yeltsin’s health deteriorated in 1999 and his popularity plummeted, Berezovsky and others began to look for a protege who could rule Russia for its second post-Soviet decade. The obscure former KGB spy they found was Putin, who was officially approved by the powerbrokers of Russia during talks at their dachas around Moscow.

‘He presented [Putin] to the Russian establishment of that time, brought him into Boris Yeltsin’s close circle, and he was the first to believe that out of this indistinct bureaucrat, a successor could be made,’ said commentator Sergei Parkhomenko. ‘He was certainly the political father of Vladimir Putin.’

Yet, after he came to power backed by Berezovsky’s cash, Putin became irritated with the demands of his sponsor, who once said: ‘Everything can be bought and everything on Earth has a price. Politicians are the hired help of entrepreneurs.’

This was an affront to Putin, a proud, self-proclaimed strongman who did not like anyone having power over him. His response was characteristically uncompromising, and after a series of death threats Berezovsky fled.

Since Britain rebuffed Putin’s calls for Berezovsky to be extradited, the Kremlin has been busy preparing case after case against him in absentia – with ‘crimes’ allegedly ranging from massive fraud to murder. Undeterred, Berezovsky used his British base to vow to overthrow Putin. He joined forces with other exiles to implicate the Russian state in killings.

But last year he suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky wanted £4billion from Abramovich, whom he accused of using the threat of Kremlin retribution to intimidate him into selling shares at a knockdown price.

Some say Berezovsky had struggled to come to come to terms with losing the case, in which legal costs hit £100million. Clearly shaken by the verdict in August, Berezovsky said it appeared to have been written by Putin himself. ‘Life is life,’ he sighed, before being driven off in a black Mercedes with tinted windows.

Those who believe he died either of natural causes or at his own hand point to his dramatic loss of capital in recent times.

His fortune, once estimated at £2billion, was running out, partly because he had spent years fighting a losing battle against Kremlin attempts to seize his assets.

He was forced to sell his £200million yacht, and closed his political foundation, which had waged a public relations war against Putin, highlighting corruption and political killings linked to the KGB. He was also reeling from one of Britain’s biggest-ever divorce settlements, to his former wife Galina in 2011, to whom he paid more than £60million.

Known for his love of cognac and beautiful women, Berezovsky was married three times and was a notorious womaniser. But lately one friend claimed he had been depressed by the loss of his wealth and was not himself.

‘We will learn later what exactly happened, but in recent months Boris was depressed,’ said Alex Goldfarb. ‘There was no secret about that. The court case was a massive blow. He was depressed. We were concerned about him.’

That concern was not shared by his enemies in the Kremlin. While an official spokesman claimed yesterday that Berezovsky had written to Putin this year to apologise, and begged to come home, his friends said this was merely Soviet-style propaganda.

Indeed, he would have faced years in prison had he returned.

Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: Boris Berezovsky will never criticise the Kremlin again, and that is just the way Vladimir Putin will like it.
