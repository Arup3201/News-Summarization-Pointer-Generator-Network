A generation of teachers will struggle to introduce a tough new school curriculum because of their own poor grasp of the three Rs, a leading headmistress warned today.

Many bright teachers are ‘completely at sea’ with proper English grammar and have little knowledge of the literary canon because their own education lacked rigour, according to Alice Phillips.

Teachers had been ‘hastily’ swotting up ahead of the introduction of the new curriculum across primary and secondary schools this week.

Problem: Teachers do not have a good enough grasp of English grammar, warns a leading headmistress

But Mrs Phillips, president of the Girls’ Schools Association, warned that extra training courses were not enough and called for more rigorous degrees for would-be teachers.

Under the new curriculum, more emphasis will be placed on giving pupils a grounding in English grammar and punctuation.

Pupils will also be required to study a broader range of classic literary works including at least one 19th century novel and a selection of poetry since 1789.

In maths, pupils will be required to cover more material with greater emphasis on times tables, fractions, algebra and mental arithmetic.

But Mrs Phillips, head of fee-paying St Catherine’s School, Bramley, near Guildford, Surrey warned that a generation of teachers would struggle to deliver the lessons because their own education lacked ‘breadth’.

She said her school had introduced a specific English grammar course for 11-year-olds only to discover that some staff were ill-equipped to teach it.

‘In the process of introducing the course we quickly established that some of our younger teachers have not been taught English grammar in the 90s and 00s when they were at school themselves and, consequently, they feel less confident as they teach as relatively new learners themselves,’ she said in a blog for the TES teachers’ journal.

‘Many of our brightest, most enthusiastic teachers have little or no grounding in English language or grammar – through no fault of their own - and are completely at sea with many aspects of proper usage,’ she added.

They would struggle to ‘delve into the mysteries of subordinate clauses’ with a class of 14-year-olds, she said.

She also warned that some English literature teachers were ‘frankly, unversed in much pre-20th century literature’.

Without prior knowledge of a broad range of texts, teachers may simply ‘bone up on two or three texts and stick to them’.

But Mrs Phillips added: ‘This is not at all in the spirit of the new curriculum, nor will it be permissible.

‘Whilst, with the old GCSE, a teacher could stick determinedly to one or two staples, the new curriculum will change set text lists more regularly.

‘This is a welcome return to variety, but are we supporting our teachers to be ready and is there time to get this right for the first generation of students?’

In maths, there was already a shortage of qualified teachers. This would lead to problems teaching the new so-called ‘big fat maths’ curriculum, said Mrs Phillips.

‘While we undoubtedly have teachers who know the maths, there are not enough of them around to teach the extras.

‘This can only mean that schools will be placing in front of students teachers for whom maths is not their degree subject, or even an allied subject.’

In a series of proposals, Mrs Phillips called for student debt to be waived for graduates who stayed in teaching for 10 years.

She also called for a Government PR campaign targeting pupils as young as 17 to encourage them to become teachers as well as a new breed of ‘subject-focused’ degree courses combined with educational theory to encourage more bright students into the profession.

‘Bridging the knowledge gap for a generation of teachers whose own education may not have included the breadth that the new curriculum espouses is our immediate task. 

'Beyond that, we must ensure that future teacher training addresses subject knowledge as well as education theory,’ she said.
