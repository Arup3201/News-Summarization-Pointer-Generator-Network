A grieving mother was involved in a dramatic courtroom row with a drug dealer because she was desperate to know who gave him the ecstasy that killed her 16-year old daughter.

Drugs counsellor Diana Harding, 47, called Thomas Donelan, 20, a 'coward' as he stayed tight lipped at a Stockport inquest into the death of college student Serena Harding.

Serena collapsed shortly after taking MDMA  - pure ecstasy - 'bombs' bought from Donelan - but although he was jailed for two years this year, he still refused to say where he got the drugs from.

In an emotional exchange Mrs Harding, from Warrington, Cheshire, confronted Donelan as she stood in the witness box.

Confrontation: Heartbroken mother Diana Harding called Thomas Donelan a 'coward' during her daughter's inquest because he failed to say who supplied the drugs that killed her child Serena

Tragic: Serena Harding, 16, was found dead after taking ecstasy last year - the first time she had taken it

She said: 'Does it not trouble you that the people who sold you this drug are going out spreading this all over the place?

'More people will die like my daughter. She would have had a future she would have had a life. Does this not prick your conscience?

'It’s these low life you are working for. They don’t tell you what goes into it what you are buying. Do you not want to stop this? You be a coward.'

But Donelan replied: 'I won’t tell you where I got it from. I can’t tell you. It is not an issue of having a conscience. It is not in any disrespect of this girl’s memory.

'I’m sorry. If I knew they were going to come into your daughter’s hands I wouldn’t have sold it.'

The hearing was told Serena who studied fashion and design at Warrington Collegiate took the £20 drug for the very first time on August 21 last year to impress a boy she had a crush on during an afternoon out with friends at Reddish Vale Country Park.

The youngster who suffered from Chron's disease which affected her immune system wallowed around one quarter of a gram of the class A party drug-known for being pure ecstasy and began having seizures. She died later in hospital.

Her mother Diana told the Stockport inquest: #It was such a horrendous shock. I still don’t believe it now that she would have taken it.

'She swore to me that she would never take drugs as she knew what I did. I had mentioned most drugs to her, I never thought she would because of how ill she was.

'I had spoken to her and she knew the dangers. I also told her that alcohol was even more dangerous statistically and I wondered whether she understood that properly or misinterpreted it.'

Mrs Harding said she felt her daughter had succumbed to peer pressure .

'If someone talks about something with a lot of enthusiasm and how wonderful it was and she was not feeling wonderful.

'She just wanted to be a normal girl like her friends. They may not have realised it was peer pressure but it was.'

Tragedy struck when Serena arranged over Facebook to buy crystal MDMA with 19-year old Michael Millington whom she was besotted with. He described the drug to her as a 'very positive and safe experience'.

They and friends bought the drugs from Donelan at a house but after taking them at the 397 acre park she complained of being thirsty then collapsed struggling from breath on a bench underneath a railway viaduct.

Millington told the hearing: 'I think I was naively bigging up the drug. I don’t know but that may have had an influence on her. I had not known Serena to use MDMA previously. Serena bought the same amount as us, and paid £20.

'Up to that point, her health, she seemed fine. She said she was a bit thirsty so I went and got her some water. She was behaving normally. I felt okay I had used MDMA previously and didn’t feel any different. Next thing she was collapsed on a bench.'

Last July Donelan from Levenshulme, Manchester was later locked away for supplying drugs. Millington, from Lymm, Cheshire was given a 12 months suspended sentence and Dean Williams, 18, of Stockport was given a six month suspended term.

At the time a judge said he and his friends were 'misguided individuals who believed and were part of a culture who believed that taking drugs such as ecstasy and MDMA is harmless.'

Recording a verdict of misadventure Coroner John Pollard said: 'Serena by no means was a habitual drug user. This was one of the first times she had tried drugs. She was a young girl who had an awful lot to put up with because of the Chron’s Disease and the effects it had on her.

'It is the embarrassment of having it as a young girl, it is a very difficult condition and the drugs prescribed made her put weight on.

'She may well have had a crush on this guy, what is certain is that she was led by others who were older and more experiences in ways of the world. On this particular occasion she did what she did to be seen to be part of the gang.

'It is quite clear that she had not done it before, she was not a regular user and this was her first time trying it.

'Enormous lessons must be learnt which may help another family. I would make the plea to anybody who may be thinking of trying it- you simply don’t know the purity or strength and you do not know the affects it will have on you.

'Bring into the mix someone who not in the most robust of health there are serious questions to be considered. There is no evidence that anyone made her take this drug. I think she was a willing participant and they all went to the address and all took some.

'Serena took this drug for the affect of the drug , she took it willingly with the intent of getting the buzz.'

In an interview after her daughter’s death Mrs Harding said: 'If my daughter could do it then somebody else’s daughter could. Television makes out like it is fashionable to take drugs, a right of passage, but no drug is safe.'

'When I got to A and E they showed me into a side room and I knew it was very serious. sat there hugging my knees and asked if my daughter was alive. They said no. It was the worst day of my life.'

'People have a stereotypical idea of what people who take drugs are like, but anybody can have a slip up.

'No mother should have to see their daughter lying dead on a medical table. Serena was out of her depth. For a mad moment she said ‘go on then’ and paid with her life.'
