The acting deputy U.S. attorney general in charge of overseeing 'public integrity' prosecutions testified Friday that he doesn't know who's in charge of the criminal investigation of Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of the tea-party targeting scandal.

David O'Neil, whose job atop the DOJ's criminal division puts him in charge of public corruption prosecutions, told Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan that he also doesn't know how many prosecutors are assigned to the case, or how many attorneys from his division are working on it.

Asked to identify the lead agent in the Lerner investigation, O'Neil would only answer, 'I'm sure that we can provide that information to you.'

Rep. Jim Jordan has asked the Justice Department seven times for information about who is leading the Lois Lerner IRS investigation, but so far has received no information

Acting Assistant Attorney General David O'Neil said Friday that he's in charge of the DOJ division overseeing public-corruption prosecutions, but didn't know who is in charge of the Lerner probe

Republicans are incensed that 
DOJ trial attorney Barbara Bosserman – a partisan who has contributed 
nearly $7,000 to President Barack Obama’s campaigns and other Democratic
 party coffers, has reportedly been appointed as the probe's point person.

They have demanded the appointment of a special counsel to take over, passing a House resolution on May 2 that claimed the Obama administration has a 'conflict of interest' and that 'statements and actions of ... the Obama Administration in connection with this matter have served to undermine the Department of Justice's investigation.'

Twenty-six House Democrats joined every Republican in voting yes.

Jordan told MailOnline Friday afternoon that O'Neil's testimony 'is even further proof as to why a special counsel is needed to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal.'

'The DOJ investigation has been a joke, as evidenced by Mr. O'Neil's unfamiliarity with even the most basic details of the work being done by the division he oversees.,' Jordan said.

'We are talking about the IRS violating the First Amendment rights of Americans, and we deserve a real investigation that helps us deliver justice.'

Lerner was found in contempt of Congress this week. She is accused of carrying out a politically motivated scheme to hamper conservative nonprofit groups' ability to raise money during the 2010 election cycle by slow-walking their applications for tax-exempt status.

Jordan blitzed O'Neil, a former New York prosecutor, with questions about the 'investigation of targeting of conservatives by the Internal Revenue Service' during a hearing about U.S. marijuana policy.

But he refused to concede that Jordan's description accurately reflected what the DOJ is investigating.

'I would disagree with that characterization. I don't – uh –,' he said, reiterating his objection a second time barely a minute later.

Robert Mueller, then the director of the FBI, testified in 2013 that he also didn't have answers, and promised to provide them to Congress.

So far, House Republicans have come up empty.

Lois Lerner ran the IRS Exempt Organizations division until her retirement in late 2013, and is accused of leading an effort to hamstring tea party groups because of their political philosophy

An exasperated Jordan fumed at O'Neil that 'we've asked you seven times. We've sent seven different inquiries to the Department of Justice, and each time they can't tell us anything.'

'I oversee the public integrity section,' O'Neil said during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing, adding that 'yes,' he is involved in the case.

He claimed there are 'numerous career federal prosecutors that are on that investigation.'

But when Jordan asked him how many are in that group, complaining that he has 'been trying to get this answer now for 11 months,' O'Neill conceded, 'I can't tell you that answer sitting here today.'

O'Neill also suggested that the Department of Justice is unlikely to appoint a special counsel.

'No,' he said. 'A special counsel is not warranted.'

When the House found Lerner in contempt, it referred her to Attorney General Holder for prosecution, prompting an aide to a Texas Republican to call it 'the slime probing the slime.'

The female staffer told MailOnline that 'if Holder ever opens the Lerner file ore than once, I'll strip naked on the National Mall and sing the president's favorite Al Green song.'
