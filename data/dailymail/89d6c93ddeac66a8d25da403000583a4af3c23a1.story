There are calls for outspoken MP Fred Nile to resign after he said the only 'man' inside the Lindt cafe siege was gunman Man Monis.  

The Christian Democrat MLC told Sunrise this morning: 'Usually men try to protect the women but it looks like the men were trying to protect their own skins.

'Where were the men? The only "man" really there was the man with the gun.' 

Asked about his remarks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Rev. Nile said he 'misspoke'. 

'I wanted to say he was a cowardly man. I left the word cowardly out. 

'(He was) hiding behind the shotgun. I was certainly not complimenting him.'

Gunman: Man Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place

In a follow-up tweet, he said: 'The terrorist was a coward. The real Man was the man WRESTLING with the gun.'

Rev. Nile had already sparked controversy earlier this week by declaring that none of the men who fled the Lindt cafe should receive bravery awards. 

Around 10am on December 15, Man Monis held up 18 people and kept them hostage for more than sixteen hours at the Martin Place cafe. 

He forced many of them to hold the black Islamic Shahada flag in the cafe's window throughout the ordeal. 

Two people - barrister Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson - were killed at the siege's bloody end. 

Mr Nile told Fairfax Radio earlier this week that Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson should be the only hostages given awards.

‘They should get recognition for what they suffered as hostages but I don't think they should get bravery awards,’ Mr Nile said.

'Even the men who fled leaving women behind': This tweet posted by Fred Nile's team sparked controversy earlier this week. He later expanded on his remarks in an interview with Fairfax Radio

‘Maybe they could have done something more to protect the women.

‘Normally bravery awards are given for an act of bravery - that somebody actually does something. They haven't done anything.’ 

Mr Nile also argued that it would only lessen the worth of bravery awards to provide them to those male hostages who fled.

Fellow state MP Alex Greenwich this morning tweeted: "The only man inside the Lindt Cafe siege at Martin Place was the man holding the gun" - He should resign for this comment'.

'Fred Nile has offended the Christian values he allegedly represents by using this tragedy ahead of an election & cruelly insulting victims'.

Mr Nile said the male hostages that fled the from siege did not deserve bravery awards 

During the siege itself, the ABC reported Rev. Nile was among many Sydney residents to gather near Martin Place, a short walk from NSW State Parliament.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier this week requested Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove support a push to honour the victims, surviving hostages and emergency services with bravery awards. 

Thousands of people, including the Prime Minister, Premier and Rev. Nile, laid flowers at Martin Place after the siege. 

A coronial inquest examining the siege presided by State Coroner Michael Barnes will begin later this month, on January 29. 

NSW Premier Mike Baird has announced that a permanent memorial will be established in Martin Place by the first anniversary of the siege. It will include a permanent garden.
