Yaya Toure says  Manchester City's £30million move for Swansea striker Wilfried Bony represents a signal of intent from the club in the Barclays Premier League title race.

And Yaya's brother Kolo has tipped Bony to become the new Didier Drogba.

The Toure brothers and Bony are in Abu Dhabi with the Ivory Coast squad as they prepare for the African Cup of Nations which starts on 17 January in Equatorial Guinea.

Swansea striker Wilfried Bony will seal a £30 million transfer to Manchester City later this month

Bony has scored 25 goals in 54 Premier League games for Swansea since arriving from Vitesse in 2011

The breakdown of the deal looks to be £25m up front, plus a further £3m if City win the Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup during Bony's contract. 

Bony would have to figure in 60 per cent of games in those competitions.

Yaya told SunSport: 'Manchester City are always a club that wants important players like Bony and Aguero, they always want to progress and be at the top of the Premier League. 

'If you want to be at the top of the Premier League you need to sign the top players and Bony is one of them at the moment. 

'It will be tough to win the title again as Chelsea are in a good moment. 

'It is not finished and we need to compete well and do the business and again.' 

Kolo added, 'He started scoring goals very quickly. It is why he is like Drogba. He is also strong, big and uses his body very well.'  

 The Ivory Coast striker is currently on international duty at the African Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea
