Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph has paid tribute to Michael Carrick and says he is excited by the prospect of learning from the Manchester United midfielder while playing alongside him for England.

The Aston Villa midfielder made his fourth appearance for England during the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday forming part of a three-man midfield with Carrick and Jordan Henderson.

And Delph believes playing with the former Tottenham and West Ham midfielder will only improve him as a player.

'He is a great guy, he has been great with me and it was pleasure to play with him the other night,' Delph told the FA's official website.

'He is calm in possession, great on the ball and he is an experienced head. It's definitely going to help me playing with him.

Carrick has won five Premier Leagues and a Champions League with Manchester United but has struggled to hold down a regular spot in the England team.

The 33-year-old has made a modest 32 appearances for the national side but Delph has always appreciated Carrick's ability.

'I have watched him over the years and I really, really admire the way he plays.

'Hopefully I can pick up some things that he does and try to implement it in my own game.' 

'I think real football people can see what he does and how he effects games, how he controls games.

'I don't think he is unappreciated, definitely not from me anyway. I see all his strengths and I get really excited when I look to my left and he's there, when I am training with him or when I see him around the building.

'I am really excited to play with him and learn from him.'
