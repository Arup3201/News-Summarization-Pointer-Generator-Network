Mother-of-ten Emma Green launched a tirade of homophobic abuse at her son Scott when he told her he was in a relationship with another man

A mother-of-ten punched her oldest son in the face in front of police officers, after he came out as gay at a family party.

Emma Green, 37, launched a tirade of homophobic abuse at her son Scott when he told her he was in a relationship with another man.

The family party then descended into a chaotic brawl and Green - who called her son a 'dirty queer' - punched him in the face in front of police officers who had been called.

Green was ordered to pay £100 to her son and was fined £200, at Perth Sheriff Court.

She admitted carrying out an assault aggravated by sexual prejudice outside the family home in Ross Street, Kinross.

Fiscal depute Lisa Marshall told the court: 'The complainer is the accused’s son who had recently disclosed to friends and family that he was in a relationship with another male.

'This caused friction in the family and particularly with the accused. On the Saturday evening there was a gathering at the Ross Street property.

'The accused, the complainer and various other people were in attendance. Drink was taken and over the course of the evening she was calling her son a p**f and a gay b******.

'The complainer ended up in the street being arrested by police in connection with an assault matter. As he was being arrested the accused approached her son and punched him to the head.'

She then continued to verbally abuse her son as police told her she was under arrest.

She replied ‘I’m homophobic. I don’t care - I hate the little gay b*****d.’”

Solicitor John Adams, defending, said: 'My client is 37 and a mother of ten children. The complainer is the eldest son and this incident came about when the family had been at a party together.

'Her son had been acting up against other members of the family and associates of the family. They were all taking alcohol and there was an incident with her son.

'She took umbrage at his actions and reacted in anger. She certainly isn’t proud of her actions. She was motivated by his sexual orientation.

'But the position in the report suggests she has reacted more in anger. That has not got a bearing on their relationship now. There is no ongoing ill-feeling between them.

'She moved to Scotland in 2010 and this is her first time before a court. She is in receipt of benefits and is responsible for a number of children.'

Sheriff Lindsay Foulis noted that the assault allegations against Scott Green were dropped by the Crown after the witnesses failed to give evidence against him at a trial.

He said: 'It is an inter-familial assault. If she hadn’t been so stupid as to strike her son when he was being held by police officers, nine times out of ten this wouldn’t have seen the light of day.

'You can’t act in this way and it was added to by the fact it was prejudiced.'
