Understudy goalkeeper Lee Robinson admits he would love to finally make his Old Firm debut - 11 years after first joining Rangers.

The 28-year-old spent five years at Ibrox as a youngster but tasted just 15 minutes of first-team action.

He was brought back to the club in the summer to provide back up to Cammy Bell and Steven Simonsen and was at last given his first start for the Light Blues in Saturday's 1-0 win against Dumbarton as Rangers booked a place in the William Hill Scottish Cup fourth round.

But news of that victory was immediately overshadowed as Gers were paired with bitter Old Firm rivals Celtic in an explosive League Cup semi-final.

Robinson may not even make the bench for that game - due to be played on either January 31 or February 1 next year - with Simonsen now recovered from the head knock which kept him out against the Sons and Bell due to be back in action early in the new year after shoulder surgery.

But the Englishman insists he will be ready to face Ronny Deila's Hoops if called upon.

Robinson said: "I'm sure this is a draw that will excite the boys - I'm probably the wrong person to ask because I've only been here a few months.

"I was only on the bench for one Old Firm game during my first stint here. That was back in 2006 or something and we lost 2-0.

"But I would love to be part of something like that."

Rangers saw off the Sons for the second time in a week thanks to Kris Boyd's third goal in five games.

The former Scotland striker clipped the ball in off the post a minute before half-time after a great spot by Lewis Macleod set him up - leaving the goalscorer to praise the 20-year-old for another moment of brilliance.

Boyd - who watched Macleod head home the winner against St Johnstone on Tuesday night to set up the Old Firm semi - said: "We've seen the performances Lewis has put in in the past couple of months.

"He's a fantastic talent and as long as he keeps working hard at his game and learning, developing and listening he can go far.

"He's a fantastic young kid with a bright future but the most important thing for him is to keep doing the right things.

"But when you see him on a field he's a joy to watch and you feel that every time he picks up the ball something is going to happen."
