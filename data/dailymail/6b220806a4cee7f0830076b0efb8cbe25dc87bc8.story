The upset of England’s travelling support at their treatment by the FA led to the chants during the victory in Switzerland concentrating on that controversy rather than the team’s top performance.

The hard core fans were furious at the FA for switching their loyalty scheme to award two points, or ‘caps’, for attending home matches and one for away games when previously it had been the reverse.

It is claimed the switch could lead to the demand for Euro 2016 tickets being over-subscribed with more fans getting enough ‘caps’ to be considered for priority allocation.

The disgruntled supporters sang: ‘Two points for Wembley, you’re having a laugh’, ‘We only get one cap’ and ‘Loyal support, treated like s***’.

The unpopular strategy has been brought in by the FA because filling Wembley for England matches is the priority over the next two years. They claim a lot of fans who travel to England away games do not watch the team at home.

The away following claim the first game since the revised credit system was introduced — the Wembley friendly against Norway — attracting the lowest crowd for an England match since the stadium opened showed a botched policy.

Fans chief Kevin Miles said: ‘There is no question the FA’s policy is alienating the loyal travelling support. After all the improvements in behaviour, being regarded as surplus to requirements has gone down like a lead balloon.’

The FA say they are monitoring fans’ disquiet but have no plans to make any changes.

Another serious concern over the FA falling out with the fans is that it will lead to a churn from the official England supporters club — all of whom are police vetted when they apply for tickets — and bring about unregulated accessing of seats elsewhere. Certainly no extra problems are needed in the build-up to the powderkeg friendly against Scotland at Celtic Park in November. However, the English and Scottish FAs said on Tuesday that they are confident of their security arrangements at a venue used to dealing with high-profile occasions where there is a potential for trouble, such as Old Firm games.

The viewing public have yet to re-engage fully with Roy Hodgson’s team, despite the impressive performance in Basle. The average of 5.6million viewers and a peak of 7.7m were less than ITV Sport were expecting for England’s toughest qualifying match on the road to Euro 2016. It does not augur well, ratings-wise, for the next game at home against San Marino, who offer no proper competition.

Meanwhile, ITV’s ranking seems to be such that commentator Clive Tyldesley was seated in British Airways economy on the way back from Switzerland while pundit colleagues Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright were travelling business class.

FA chairman Greg Dyke, who was famously spotted reading the aptly-named erotic thriller A Death in Brazil while watching England training during the World Cup, whiled away some time in Basle in similar cerebral fashion — at an arts and craft store checking out pencils and brushes.

A youth football league with more than 10,000 players has returned its FA Charter Standard award in protest at a mandatory rule to award three points for a win across all age groups from under 10 upwards.

The South East London and Kent League pride themselves on child friendly principles and want to keep two points for a victory to stop teams running away with the league or being stranded at the bottom. The FA have yet to respond.

Bookmaker giants Ladbrokes — who have helped revitalise the St Leger — are not expected to renew their title sponsorship of the fifth Classic after Saturday’s running, following the clash with Irish Champions weekend. Ladbrokes will wait for post-race findings before reaching a decision.

Aston Villa's bright start to the Premier League — leading to Fabian Delph’s promising England debut — has also meant selling American owner Randy Lerner remaining remarkably relaxed that there are no buyers on the horizon.
