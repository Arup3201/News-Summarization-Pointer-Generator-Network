Remembered: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs was honoured at a private service

An extraordinary array of figures from the worlds of business, politics and entertainment flocked to pay their respects at a private ceremony for their friend, the late Apple founder, Steve Jobs.

Former president Bill Clinton and U2 frontman Bono rubbed shoulders with dozens of top Silicon Valley executives at the moving service which was held at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

Other guests included News Corp Chief Digital Officer Jon Miller, Google co-founder Larry Page, former U.S. vice president Al Gore and the founders of US software maker Adobe.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, who took over from Jobs in August walked up to the chapel with a man dressed in the garb of a Buddhist monk.

Actor Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the blockbuster 'Toy Story' animated films made by Pixar, a studio founded by Jobs, was also in attendance.

Jay Y. Lee, the son of Samsung chairman Lee Kun-Hee, who are fierce rivals to Apple, attended in response to a personal invitation from Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Security guards blocked of roads half a mile away from the university's memorial church and the campus was closed to the public for around eight hours.

Guests arrived in dozens of black limousines and tinted-out out SUVs before walking up a path lighted by hundreds of large white candles to the Memorial Church in the heart of Stanford University's campus.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared Sunday as 'Steve Jobs Day' in the western US state.

He said: 'To call him influential would be an understatement.... His innovations transformed an industry, and the products he conceived and shepherded to market have changed the way the entire world communicates," Brown said in a statement.'

Mr. Jobs, who struggled for years with pancreatic cancer, is credited as a visionary who ushered a string of successful products, including the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and Apple's iTunes music store.

He masterminded Apple's turnaround from near bankruptcy in 1996, turning it into the world's most highly-valued technology company.

The memorial was held two days after Apple released its latest iPhone, the 4S, which Mr Jobs helped develop and appears to have been a hit with consumers despite initial disappointment among industry analysts and bloggers.

Apple said pre-orders were the best ever, while AT&T Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp. said initial sales were also their best yet.

Love: Jobs met his wife Laurene Powell on the Stanford campus in 1989 when he gave a talk to students

The touching ceremony is believed to have been organised by Job's widow Laurene Powell-Jobs

It was on the Stanford campus that Steve Jobs met Laurene, who was 
studying for a graduate business degree, in 1989 when he gave a talk to 
students.

And it was also there that in 2005 he delivered his most famous and 
moving speech, on the lessons he had learned from his first struggles 
with the disease.

'Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever
encountered to help me make the big choices in life,' he said in a 
commencement address to students.

'Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all 
fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the 
face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

'Remembering that 
you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of 
thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no 
reason not to follow your heart.'

Apple also plans to host an event for Apple employees to celebrate Jobs' life at its headquarters in Cupertino on October 19.

Jobs' legacy continued to resonate across the globe on Friday in commercial terms as well as tributes.

Apple shares closed at a record high as the company put its latest device, the iPhone 4S, on sale at retail stores in the U.S. and six other countries.
