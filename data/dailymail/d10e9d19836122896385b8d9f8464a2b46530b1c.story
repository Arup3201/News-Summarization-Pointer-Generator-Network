Ali Carter will tackle Shaun Murphy in the final of the General Cup in Hong Kong on Saturday after making an impressive return to snooker.

Essex cueman Carter has been undergoing treatment for lung cancer and is making his first competitive appearance this week since last season's World Championship.

The invitational tournament has featured several of snooker's leading players, and Carter beat defending champion Mark Davis 6-2 in the semi-finals, making a best break of 139 during his convincing win.

Murphy defeated Joe Perry 6-5 in the other semi-final, aided by a break of 144 and a run of 80 in the deciding frame.

Carter, 35, is a two-time former World Championship runner-up who last year was treated for testicular cancer and has battled Crohn's disease for over a decade.

He put off his return to snooker recently when pulling out of a Players Tour Championship event in Sofia, Bulgaria, following a final round of chemotherapy.

But Carter has been thrilled by his return to the baize, writing on Twitter on Friday: 'Through to the final of the general cup her in Hong Kong! I'm delighted... can't believe it, to where I was a few months ago!!'
