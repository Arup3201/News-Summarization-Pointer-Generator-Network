A 23-year-old woman has been jailed for more than four years after she tipped a disabled pensioner out of her wheelchair - just to steal £20. 

Tanya Frankum offered to help Patricia Haskins, 67, when she found herself alone in Worcester city centre on August 26 last year. 

But instead of playing the Good Samaritan, Frankum wheeled her towards the River Severn close to the cathedral.

There she tipped the pensioner - who suffers from a development disability - on to the ground before making off with her handbag and purse. 

Miss Haskins was later discovered by a member of the public in distress and helpless on the ground and was later treated for injuries to her knees.   

On Wednesday, Frankum admitted robbery and was jailed for three years and nine months at Worcester Crown Court.

She was also imprisoned for an additional six months to run consecutively for an assault on a woman at a hostel in Worcester, for which she had previously been given a community order.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Cullum said: 'You deliberately took her the wrong way and, in an absolutely shameful act, tipped that woman out of her wheelchair, robbed her then left her helpless.

'That was a wicked act. That vile abuse was bound to affect the independence of her victim.'

He added that Miss Haskins had placed her trust in Frankum to get her home and said there was 'no excuse for such a callous act.'

Jason Aris, for the prosecution, said Frankum acted around 10.15pm after offering to help the pensioner, whom she knew.

He added: 'Before she could get her bearings, this defendant tipped Miss Haskins on to the ground and took her handbag and her purse, which was attached to Miss Haskins' belt.'

After she was arrested, Frankum claimed the man she was with had robbed Miss Haskins and she had gone to help the pensioner.

But the man present at the incident was never charged and has since died, the court heard.  

Brendan Reedy, defending, admitted it had been a 'nasty and mean' offence to tip someone out of a wheelchair.

But he said Frankum, who appeared via video-link from Eastwood Park prison, Gloucestershire, had been living 'back on the streets' and was in an emotional state because her baby had been taken away by social services.

After the hearing, a spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'We are pleased with the result from the Crown Court in this unprovoked crime which was carried out against a vulnerable and defenceless member of the community.'
