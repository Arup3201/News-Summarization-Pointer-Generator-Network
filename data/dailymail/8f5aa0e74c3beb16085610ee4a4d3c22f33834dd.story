Men may believe that whizzing around in an expensive set of wheels is the way to a woman's heart, but they couldn't be more wrong.

The stereotype that women are turned on by flashy cars is in tatters as new research has shown that, while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex, women actually labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant, self-centred and dangerous.

New research aimed to establish whether the type of car you drive actually does influence perceptions - and the results could make you think twice before buying your next car.

Sorry, Lewis Hamilton! Women label drivers of sports cars as 'arrogant, self-centred and dangerous'

While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits.

Meanwhile, men tended to most associate negative personality traits with drivers of 4x4s, viewing owners of these vehicles as arrogant, rude, and self-centred.

By comparison, women felt that saloon drivers (like Ford Mondeo, Renault Megane, VW Passsat) were likely to be hard working and safe drivers, while hatchback drivers were seen as being modest.

Both sexes attributed the most positive personality types with eco- car drivers (such as Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius), naming them as the most likely to be conscientious, intelligent and also the safest drivers on the road.

Despite being one of the most difficult colours to keep clean, the research found that black is the car colour that is most likely to turn someone’s head.

Not so fast! While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits and prefer those who drive eco-friendly cars

The research suggests that the perfect car for a man looking to attract a partner would be a black eco-car, such as a Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf.

Phill Jones, a spokesman for Motors.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'Our survey provided an interesting snapshot into how people perceive car drivers, with the bad boy sports car stereotype still holding true.

'The disparity between men and women suggests that the yummy mummy “Chelsea tractor” stereotype might be having a similar effect on men as sports cars appear to be having on women. 

'While there is no doubt that owning the Batmobile or a Back to the Future Delorean would be a conversation starter if you’re looking to meet new people, in reality the car we buy is likely to make us feel more confident rather than make other people find us more attractive.'
