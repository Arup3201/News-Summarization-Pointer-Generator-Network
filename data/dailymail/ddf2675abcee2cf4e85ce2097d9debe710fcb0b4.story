A Minnesota father had to choose which of his seven children to save when a fire broke out in his Minneapolis duplex on Friday night.

Tragically, 60-year-old widower Troy Lewis was only able to save two of his children, 9-year-old Shaca and 5-year-old Electra. The children who died in the blaze ranged in age from 8 years to just 19 months.

Lewis cried from his hospital bed, describing the choice no parent wants to make.

'I wanted to get all of my babies,' Lewis told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'All of my babies. I wanted all my babies.'

Blaze: Lewis managed to save two of his seven children before the flames, pictured, became too much

Shaca and Electra are still in critical condition according to a Hennepin County Medical Center spokesman.

The
 fire broke out around 4:30am on the top floor of the duplex. According 
to the building's landlord, Lewis and his children had been living there
 for the past six or eight months. The children's mother Kim Davis, 31, 
died in November from cancer.

Lewis had to jump out of his second-story window to escape the blaze.

He injured his back in the fall, but went right back into the house to save his children.

First he grabbed Shaca who was gasping for air.

Then he went for 8-year-old Christopher, but found his son already dead.

'He was dead,' Lewis told the Star Tribune. 'I saw him burned. I saw my baby burn.'

Two
 other children shared a bedroom with Christopher, 5-year-old Fannie and
 3-year-old Troy, so Lewis moved on to look for the other kids knowing 
those two children didn't make it.

Tragic: Five of Troy Lewis' seven children died in a duplex fire Friday morning

Cause: Authorities say the fire started on the second floor, and likely was caused by a space heater

'I had a choice to make, a dead child here or...a live one,' Lewis said.

After rescuing Shaca and Electra, Lewis again attempted to get back into the house but by then it was engulfed in flames.

'I ran back upstairs to get the third child, that's when I stopped. I couldn't do it no more. Out of seven, I have two. I have to be strong for them,' Lewis told WCCO.

'All I can say is that they were beautiful children,' Lewis added. Should have never moved into that house.'

The Minneapolis Fire Department was still investigating the cause of the Friday fire.

A space heater was found on the ground of the upper apartment, but officials don't know if it was in use when the fire began.

Temperatures reached a lot of 0 degrees on Friday, Valentine's Day.

Landlord Paul Bertelson’s company identifies distressed
 or foreclosed properties, refurbishes them and rents to low-income 
families. He said the 102-year-old duplex had smoke and carbon monoxide 
detectors. The upper unit is heated by permanent baseboard units.

There were no current code violations on the duplex where 15 people lived.

Neighbor Brandi Craig awoke to the children's cries when the fire broke out before dawn.

'They were all screaming,' Craig said, her face twisting with emotion. 'Once they stopped screaming, it was over.'

Craig said that just the night before she and her fiance had stopped by to give the kids some soft drinks.

'We gave them hugs and kisses and told them we’d see them in the morning,' she said.

Instead she woke up to see the house engulfed in flames, a blaze already too dangerous for her to do anything but watch as firefighters broke down the door and tried to rescue the kids. She saw them bring two apparently already dead children from the building. At that point, she said, she couldn’t watch anymore.

Lucky: A man living on the first floor of the building smelled smoke and evacuated the house with his family

Neighbors say the second and third floors of the home were occupied by a man and his seven children ranging in age from 1 to 9

'It just took everything away from me,' she said.

Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said three children died at the scene. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed the two additional deaths but did not release any information about the victims.

Fruetel said firefighters encountered heavy smoke and fire on the second and third floors of the duplex as they searched for victims and survivors. It took firefighters about 2½ hours to put out the blaze.

He said investigators were still trying Friday to determine a cause, but it appeared the fire started on the second floor, in the center of the building.

He said the building was up to code and smoke detectors were hard-wired and appeared to be working. He said he didn’t know if the smoke detectors went off before this fire.

Gov. Mark Dayton issued a statement offering condolences to the family and friends of the victims, and thanking firefighters and other first responders 'whose heroism saved lives this morning.'

Minneapolis Public Schools confirmed two of the children killed were students at Bethune Community School, in the first and second grades.

City records show an inspection report last summer called for repairs to smoke detectors in the unit, among other violations. City spokesman Matt Laible said all of the violations were taken care of and that the unit’s rental license was renewed just a week ago.

One of the more than 40 firefighters who responded to the scene was injured. Fruetel said he suffered a muscle strain.

The Red Cross was assisting three adults and four children who were displaced by the fire.
