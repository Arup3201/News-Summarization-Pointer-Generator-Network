The boss of the Iceland supermarket chain admitted he would not eat cheap own-brand food products – because they ‘won’t contain much meat’.

Malcolm Walker also claimed the horse meat scandal was a ‘storm in a tea cup’, and insisted that supermarkets should not be blamed for it.

Most supermarkets sold three types of products, he said – premium, standard and economy – and he would not eat the economy product.

Opinion: Malcolm Walker, chief executive of frozen food firm Iceland, said supermarkets are less at fault for the horsemeat problem and slammed councils for awarding food contracts 'based purely on one thing - price'

‘Iceland has never sold economy products – we do not sell cheap food,’ he said.

‘We have one brand of food, one level of food . . . we know where all our food comes from, we follow the supply chain right the way through and it’s very short.’

He added: ‘I wouldn’t eat value supermarket products because they won’t  contain much meat. There will be other things in there, whether it’s rusk or filler or whatever it is.’

Mr Walker, whose chain has removed beef products which tested positive for traces of horse DNA, denied that horse meat was endemic in the food chain.

He insisted Britain’s supermarkets ‘shouldn’t be blamed’ for contamination and claimed they had ‘a fantastic reputation for safety’ of products.

Instead, he blamed local councils for the scandal, saying they had compromised food quality by trying to drive down the prices of catering contracts for schools and hospitals.

Mr Walker said: ‘Supermarkets carry out an enormous range of testing procedures on every product that bears their name.

'Okay, you can say we haven’t been testing for horse. Well, why would we? We don’t test for hedgehog either.’

Fears: Mark Price, the managing director of Waitrose, warned consumers could pay the price for the scandal, as ensuring food has the best safety guarantees means it can no longer be seen as a 'cheap commodity'

He told the BBC that supermarket products did not contain horse meat, even though the scandal erupted last month when Tesco Everyday Value Beef Burgers were found to be 29 per cent horse meat.

Tesco then admitted the ‘minced beef’ in its frozen bolognese was up to 100 per cent horse meat.

‘If we’re going to blame somebody,’ Mr Walker said, ‘let’s start with local authorities because there’s a whole side to this industry which is invisible.

Talks: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has called on supermarkets to do more to explain to customers how horsemeat entered the food chain

‘That’s the catering industry. Schools, hospitals – it’s massive business for cheap food and local authorities award contracts based purely on one thing: price.’

An angry Mr Walker then told Channel 4 News: ‘Supermarkets are on the high street, they’re very visible, and they’ve taken all the blame for this and that’s not right.

‘I don’t believe that any horse flesh has actually ended up in a British supermarket, [it’s] traces, microscopic contamination quantities.

'The Tesco problem was a filler, it wasn’t meat at all, it was a filler that they put into a cheap burger.

‘This is a storm in a tea cup – it’s over-hyped.’

Investigation: FSA chief executive Catherine Brown said that testing was the right way to address the issue, and said the focus would be on areas of higher risk

Investigation: One of the plants raided, Dinos & Sons Continental Foods in Tottenham, said it was 'co-operating with local trading standards officers and the FSA'

The Iceland boss’s comments provoked anger from the Local Government Association, which accused Mr Walker of passing the buck and said local authorities did not handle catering contracts for hospitals.

A spokesman said: ‘The law is 100 per cent clear that it is the responsibility of the manufacturer, supplier and retailer to make sure the product they sell us is what they say it is.

‘There has been a major supply chain failure that’s not the fault of consumers, councils or hospitals. The companies that supply our food need to take responsibility.’

n Almost a third of voters (31 per cent) have stopped eating ready-meals as a result of the scandal, a poll suggested yesterday, and one in 14 has stopped eating meat altogether.

The ComRes survey for the  Independent on Sunday also found that 53 per cent of those questioned favoured a ban on all meat imports ‘until we can be sure of their origin’.
