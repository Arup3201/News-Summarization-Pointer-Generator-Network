A woman who dubbed herself the 'human dustbin' has lost more than 14 stone.

Emma Corrigan, 34, ballooned to a life-threatening 27st 4lbs after gorging on multi-packs of crisps and chocolate.

The charity worker had become so big that she was even refused entry to a rollercoaster ride.

She said: 'I was beyond enormous. I could eat a multi-pack of crisps in one go. Food was the answer to all my problems.

Charity worker Emma Corrigan, 34, ballooned to more than 27st after gorging on crisps and chocolate

'I loved sweets and chocolate and big bowls of creamy pasta and glasses of wine.

'I was the biggest kid in my class and I felt like a giant. Mum told me the other kids would catch up but they never did.

'I'd get get called "fatty" and other awful names but I'd just console myself with a biscuit.'

By the age of 18 Emma who is 5ft 8ins had grown to a size 20. As time passed she got bigger and bigger and reached a massive size 32.

Once Emma got invited to a BBQ and after she piled her plate with sausages she sat down - only for her bottom to get stuck in a plastic chair.

She says: 'I would laugh at these horribly embarrassing moments by playing the clown. It was easier than doing something about it.

'I reasoned there was worse things than carrying a few extra pounds.

Then at 25, she met Jon Hancock, then 32, who adored her curves.

She says: 'I loved cuddling up in front of the telly with him with a big bag or two of tortilla crisps.'

But it was one night after watching the television programme Supersize vs Superskinny that she decided to change her life.

Emma used to weigh 27 stone but after swapping crisps for diet shakes now weighs just 13 stone

She said: 'I couldn't take my eyes of this enormous woman on the screen. It was more like looking in the mirror. I turned to Jon afterwards and said 'she's just like me.'

In late 2012 a friend recommend Emma try the very low-calorie diet LighterLife.

Food is completely replaced by four meal packs a day in the form of shakes, soups and bars.

She said: 'I was twice the size of everyone else. I got on the scales and weighed over 27 stone. It was pretty mortifying.'

Emma, of Manchester, swapped her normal 3,000 calories a day with meal replacements totalling 600 calories.

She said: 'Of course it wasn't easy giving up my favourite foods like chocolate and bread but I did it.

'In the first week I lost 11 pounds and was so pleased.'

After losing more than 14 stone Emma can really see the difference in her appearance

Now a year on Emma has lost 14 stone 2lbs and is a slinky size 14.

She said: 'Even my feet have shrunk. I feel like a different person. I guess I am because I've lost the weight of a whole human being!

'I love wearing feminine dresses and heels. I could never wear lovely shoes before because it was just too painful because of the weight of my body.

'I want to lose 15 stone in total and then I will be happy.

'I now exercise regularly and Jon thinks I look absolutely amazing. He's so proud of me. He says I am superhuman.'

Another long held wish came true for Emma. 'I went on a rollercoaster for the first time after queuing for an hour - only to discover I hate them after all.'
