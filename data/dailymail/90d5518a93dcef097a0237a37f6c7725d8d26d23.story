Republicans are trying to boost women's support for the GOP presidential nominee by setting up a political action group to back female candidates.

An adviser to Sarah Palin, a Tea Party leader and a Republican politician are together starting the innovative ‘ShePAC’ political action committee.

Tim Crawford, who has advised 2008 vice presidential nominee Mrs Palin and former President Ronald Reagan, is one of the three founders.

The group filed registration documents with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to create the super PAC, its leaders said.

ShePAC joins dozens of such outside groups that can now raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they don’t work with official campaigns.

Thanks to a 2010 U.S. court decision, outside groups have already  spent $54million on congressional and presidential races this campaign season.

They are taking over most of the negative advertising and pumping up the cost of running campaigns in traditionally cheaper state races.

ShePAC hopes to raise $25million by tapping both grassroots and establishment donors to help GOP women win state and federal races.

It will also help bring the women's vote to the GOP nominee opposing Democratic President Barack Obama in the November general election.

‘We firmly believe that women will make the difference in 2012 and beyond, not just at the ballot box but as candidates,’ Ms Terrell said.

‘We seek (to) increase the number of Republican women office holders on all levels with both financial and organisational support.’

The GOP needs four seats in the Senate to take control as the majority party. Only 5.5 per cent of Congress is held by conservative women.

One is Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party favourite who dropped her presidential bid last month after a poor finish in the Iowa GOP contest.

Republican women are in Senate races in Hawaii, New Mexico, Missouri, Nebraska, Virginia and Connecticut.

ShePAC also may be a vehicle for Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, who has already joined the group's Facebook page.

She is facing a recall election alongside Governor Scott Walker after they curtailed collective bargaining rights of unionised public workers.
