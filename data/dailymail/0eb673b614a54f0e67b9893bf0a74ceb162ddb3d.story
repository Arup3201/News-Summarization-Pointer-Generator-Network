A naked man who was acting erratically at an Atlanta airport gate was shocked with a stun gun and will likely face criminal charges, Atlanta police say. 

The 23-year-old man was at a Delta gate in the A concourse of the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Thursday morning yelling and acting strangely, police spokesman Greg Lyon said.

The man, identified as Derrick Weems by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, did not calm down when police approached him.

Lyon said airport police were called to try to calm the man, but he kept yelling and an officer hit him with the stun gun to try controlling the situation without a physical fight.

Lyon says the man was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for a medical evaluation and will be charged with disorderly conduct.
