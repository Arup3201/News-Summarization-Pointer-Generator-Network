Double tragedy: Judge Peter Fenn, 56, lost his battle to cancer just a few hours after his wife Maxine was found dead at their home in Ipswich

The devoted wife of a judge has died in a suspected suicide hours before he lost his battle with cancer.

The body of Maxine Fenn, 46, was found at the couple’s home as her husband, Peter Fenn, 56, lay in a hospice bed.

She was said to be ‘mentally and physically exhausted’ after caring for Mr Fenn throughout his three-year cancer ordeal.

Friends described the deaths as ‘an almost Shakespearean tragedy’ and said the judge passed away in the hospice without knowing that his wife had died before him.

Mr Fenn, who had been a judge at Ipswich Crown Court, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 but carried on hearing cases until he fell ill during a trial last November.

Friends contacted police last Thursday evening after Mrs Fenn, a keen horsewoman, failed to respond to text messages and phone calls.

Officers broke down the front door of the couple’s house in Ipswich and found her dead inside with her two collie dogs alive and well beside her.

It is believed that she had taken an overdose of pills.

Mr Fenn, who was being cared for at St Elizabeth’s Hospice in Ipswich, died the next day.

Yesterday friends said Mrs Fenn had cared tirelessly for her husband.

Carol Hipkin, chairman of the Colne Valley Riding Club in Essex, where Mrs Fenn organised cross-country events, said: ‘They were a very close couple and she worked extremely hard looking after him and supporting him when he was ill.

‘She was a tower of strength to her husband. It was awful for her and towards the end she was mentally and physically exhausted.

‘It was an ordeal for both of them. I like to think her spirit left her body and was at her husband’s bedside when he died.’

Mrs Hipkin said her friend had never talked about suicide, but added: ‘A couple of weeks ago, she did talk about what she wanted to happen if something happened to her. She was talking about who would look after her horses and how the dogs would possibly go back to the breeder.’

Cases at Ipswich Crown Court were halted on Monday while barristers, judges and court staff gathered to hear resident judge David Goodin pay tribute to Mr Fenn, who was an accomplished musician and director of music at his church in Stowmarket.

Judge Goodin described him as ‘intelligent, dedicated, straightforward and respected’ and praised him for his ‘patience, fairness and authority without pomp and arrogance’.

He added: ‘In Maxine he had a wife who supported him through his judicial career and latterly through the gruelling illness he bore so bravely and for so long.

'As a couple they were dedicated to each other and shared a love of horses, dogs and travel.’

Barrister Martyn Levett, who was a close friend of Mr Fenn, added: ‘In his final days I asked if there was anything he would like to change or whether there was ever a time he felt like giving up. “Never”, he said, “I have done more than most. I have loved and been loved. I have good friends and my only wish is that I could spend more time with those who I will leave behind”.

‘By a cruel irony, almost Shakespearean in its tragedy, Maxine, ten years younger, predeceased him by no more than 24 hours in an untimely death herself.’

The couple, who married in 2000, had no children. An inquest into Mrs Fenn’s death will be opened next week.
