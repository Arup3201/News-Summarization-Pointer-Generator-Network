The gallantry medal awarded to a bomb disposal novice blown up during the first weeks of the Blitz has sold at auction for £74,500.

Ordinary Seaman Bennett Southwell had come to London to volunteer in a bomb disposal unit, but was tragically killed just a few weeks into the job.

He was passing tools to this commanding officer Sub-lieutenant Jack Easton when he accidentally activated the bomb, giving them both 12 seconds to escape the explosion.

Sale: OS Southwell's George Cross (left) sold for £74,500. His 1939-1945 War Medal (right) also sold in the same lot.

While Sub-lieutenant Easton was able 
to get behind a nearby bomb shelter, OS Southwell was caught up in the 
blast and died immediately.

He was awarded the George Cross, the nation's second-highest award for gallantry, just three months later.

The original was sadly stolen in 1945, but the replacement medal had stayed in the family until it was sold by relatives at Dix Noonan Webb in London.

David Erskine-Hill, of London 
auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'Direct wartime awards of the George 
Cross are extremely rare, and few of them more evocative or poignant 
than the example to Southwell Bennett.

'His
tragic death might normally have passed with no further comment beyond 
the bland statement that announced the award of his decoration in the 
London Gazette.

'Unusually,
however, his officer, though seriously injured, survived the incident, 
as a result of which the full story behind Bennett’s gallantry later 
emerged.'

Devastation: The Blitz ravaged London and tore huge holes in the streets, such as this one seen in front of the Royal Exchange

The bomb disposal units of the Second World War saved countless lives, and allowed Britain's war effort to continue unhindered.

Their exploits were later commemorated in a 1970s TV series called Danger UXB - a reference to the warning signs which coated London to warn passers-by away from the bombs.

The bomb which killed OS Southwell had
landed in the East End of London in the first weeks of the Blitz, when 
Hitler turned his attention from British airfields to the capital.

After
the parachute mine buried in a house in London’s East End began 
whirring, he and Sub Lieutenant Jack Easton had 12 seconds to get clear 
of it.

The senior officer managed to dive behind a nearby surface air raid shelter and, despite being buried by rubble, survived.

Deadly work: The Bomb Disposal units working in the Blitz put themselves at huge risk, as shown in this scene from 1970s series Danger UXB

OS Southwell, who only joined the bomb disposal team days before, ran down the street and was struck by flying debris and died instantly.

He was posthumously awarded the George Cross which his relatives have now sold at auction for 74,500 pounds.

OS Southwell, from Rotherham, South Yorks, was a married father of one when he was called up for the war in July 1940.

He volunteered for mine and bomb disposal in September 1940 and died on October 17.

Sub Lt Easton later wrote of how the two men were called to Hoxton in the East End to a UXB that hung suspended from a ceiling of a house just six inches from the floor.

He said: 'I called my Rating (Southwell) into the hallway and explained the position. He would remain in the passage and pass me whatever tools I required.

War effort: Bomb disposal officers stopped Britain coming to a standstill during German air raids

'I had been working to detach the keep ring for about a minute when the bomb slipped in front of me. I heard the whirr of the bomb mechanism. Unless I got clear I had exactly 12 seconds to live.

'I pulled open the door against the weight of planks and I ran. I was through the hall in two leaps.

'I saw my Rating running down the street to what he, poor devil, thought was safety.

'I had no time to use distance for safety and ran across the roadway to a surface air raid shelter opposite. I flung myself on its far side, its bulk between me and the house.'

Sub Lt Easton was pulled out from underneath the demolished shelter unconscious and with a broken back.

He added: 'My Rating was killed. He was beheaded by the blast. The mine destroyed six streets and it was six weeks before his body was found among the rubble.

'He was a brave man and left behind a brave widow. I saw her receive her husband’s decoration from His Majesty the King.'

The George Cross that sold was actually an official replacement after the original was stolen in 1945. OS Southwell’s War Medal 1939-45 also sold alongside it.

Throughout the six years of the Second World War, the men and women of Bomb Disposal faced the continuous challenge of falling bombs - many of which were designed not to explode straight away in order to create more fear and devastation.

When air raids over Britain began, the Army had very little idea of how to defuse the devices, but quickly developed tools and methods to make the explosives safe.

Bombs were actually less deadly than expected - early estimates said the Blitz would kill almost 2million people, rather than the 55,000 it did - but the consequences were still devastating.

In saving thousands of civilian lives, 750 of their own number were killed, more than half as many again as the tally of British aircrew who died during the Battle of Britain.

Vital work: Bomb disposal experts tentatively lift a bomb out of the ground

Once air raids started against Britain in earnest, Churchill personally ordered that Bomb Disposal be given all the resources they needed to carry out their 'highly dangerous' work.

By the time the Blitz ended in mid-1941, more than 40,000 civilians had been killed, half of them in London. More than 190,000 bombs had fallen, 20,000 of them UXBs.

When peace was declared in May 1945, the men of Bomb Disposal had defused about 40,000 high explosive bombs, together with some 5,700 butterfly bombs and another 6,900 anti-aircraft shells and incendiaries.

But their work was far from over. Between 1950 and 1958, another 140 UXBs were disposed of and 150 others discovered.

The clear-up continues even today, with bombs regularly found on building sites.

Andrew Relton - No, every 'S' does not have to be replaced by a 'Z', but bombs and missiles ARE fitted with fuZes. The word FUZE is used to differentiate it from the electrical FUSE.

The bomb disposal officer handling the fuse of an unexploded bomb and the experts tentatively lifting a bomb out of the ground are ACTORS from the tv show UXB.The real men who carried out this type of work during the war were the bravest of the brave.They sometimes carried out this work whilst the bombs were still droping.Every single one of them should have received a bravery award

- therealscarface , Liverpool,+++That medal has no real value, but it has all the value in the world in that it represents a man's life. Lost in the hope that others might live. To dismiss that in the heartless, snappy, immediate  world you'd prefer to exist in would make us truly lost.  Perhaps you already are lost. You have no idea of the  of the years that man lived and died  in. Don't comment on that you know nothing of.

There are a lot of much safer jobs that I can think of like Blindfolded Bullfighter and Free Fall Parachutist with out the parachute!

" removing the fuze from it," fuze ? I think you mean fuse ....... or does every 's' have to be replaced with a 'z' now ?

If you thought that rendering unexploded German bombs safe was dead easy, a simple matter of removing the fuze from it, you'd be completely wrong. What most people don't know is that quite a few German bomb fuzes had integrated booby-trap mechanisms inside them. These were highly sensitive and would automatically trigger detonation if the bomb was moved even slightly, or if someone tried to remove the fuze from the bomb in an attempt to make it safe. In short, these bombs were specifically designed to kill the very men who were tasked with rendering them safe. It took great courage to kneel down next to an unexploded bomb knowing that it had been fitted with an anti-handling device that had been put there in the hope of blowing you to shreds. Some bombs had 2 fuzes fitted. One could be a booby-trap fuze and the other might be a clock-work delay, ticking away the seconds until detonation in the next 12 hours or 12 minutes. Very scary for the men who had to render them safe!
