Updates: A message about Mitchell's condition was posted to her official Twitter on Tuesday night

Earlier her website urged fans to: 'Light a candle and sing a song, let's all send good wishes her way.' 

Sources earlier told TMZ that a 911 call was received from Joni's Los Angeles home at 2.30pm, with the caller stating she was unconscious. 

Paramedics who responded reported that the Big Yellow Taxi singer was 'alert' during the journey.

It is not yet known what prompted the medical emergency. 

Mitchell has been known to retreat inside her Spanish-style villa and not venture out for extended periods of time.

She has lived in the Bel-Air home alone since 1974 and has previously spoken about how she enjoys her autonomy.

'Yes, you can call me a recluse,' she told The Star in 2013. 

'But I like living alone.'

The Canadian-born singer has won eight Grammys in her career and was one of the most iconic stars of her generation.

Last year, Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, admitted she endured years of turmoil after being diagnosed with the rare condition Morgellons disease, which made her believe parasites were living under her skin.

The condition is not acknowledged by Western medicine, which considers it psychological.

In the memoir, Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words, she revealed: 'At the height of my illness I could not even wear clothing. 

'All the time it felt like I was being eaten alive by parasites living under my skin. I couldn't leave my house for several years. 

'Sometimes it got so bad I couldn't walk and I'd have to crawl across the floor. My legs would cramp up, just like I was having a polio spasm.'

Mitchell is known to have a history of health issues, having also overcome polio and scarlet fever.  

Recent interview: Joni Mitchell invited CNN into her home last year for a in-depth sit-down interview. She spoke of her career, health and being referred to as a 'recluse'

The singer, who gave up singing in 2010 because 'six decades of heavy smoking have finally robbed me of my voice,' also previously revealed she suffered from insomnia and acute paranoia. 

She has been smoking since she was nine. 

A spokesman for the star did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
