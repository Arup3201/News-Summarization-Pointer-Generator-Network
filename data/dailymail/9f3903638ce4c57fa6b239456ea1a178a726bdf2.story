Nathan Penlington  is an obsessive. What he likes doing more than anything else is collecting things — things that you or I might not necessarily think are worth collecting.

One of his most treasured collections consists of Uri Geller merchandise.

So impressed was the teenage Penlington with Geller’s spoon-bending prowess that he hunted down every product that Geller has ever endorsed — from a limited-edition range of porcelain plates, to a collection of psychically energised teddy bears.

Obsessive: Nathan Penlington made it his mission to find the boy in the book

When he sees that 506 different Choose Your Own Adventure books are being  auctioned on eBay, Penlington does  not hesitate. As far as he’s concerned, Choose Your Own Adventure, a series of books produced in the Eighties in which  the reader has the power to determine the plot, are every bit as collectible as Uri Geller teddies.

He puts in what turns out to be a winning bid of £41.01, and a few days later a large parcel arrives at his home.

At this point something strange happens. Inside one of the books, Penlington finds several sheets of paper. They are a diary, or a section of diary, written 20 years earlier by the original owner, a 15-year-old boy called Terence Prendergast.

What strikes Penlington most of all is  how sad the entries are. The boy who had written them plainly had no friends and no self-confidence.

Bullied at school, he had sought refuge in the fantasy of becoming a hero. The most disturbing entry reads simply: ‘Left school with intention to kill myself.’ Penlington becomes determined to track down Terence Prendergast and find out what had happened to him. His girlfriend warns him that this is not necessarily a good idea — after all, Prendergast may no longer be alive — but he’s having none of it. He has found a new obsession.

His early efforts are not promising. Although Penlington finds plenty of Terence Prendergasts, none of them is the author of the diary — although one does turn out to be the Archbishop of Ottawa. But the more he digs, the more he comes to realise that he is also exploring his own past. He, too, was a lonely, self-conscious adolescent and his quest becomes in part a quest for the boy that he used to be.

By dint of some dogged detective work, Penlington finally runs Prendergast to ground, alive and well and living with his parents in a suburb of Birmingham. ‘The door is pulled open by a boyish-looking man, wearing a tee-shirt and jeans . . . This is him. This is the boy in the book.’

While the two men chat away and end up forging a kind of friendship, Prendergast himself proves to be a bit of a letdown. Far from being mired in gloom, he seems disappointingly well-adjusted.

While he was clearly an unhappy  adolescent, his suicidal urges were never that strong, he insists — although he  did once put a loaded air pistol in his mouth and pull the trigger. ‘The pellet must have hit my tongue or something, because it bounced straight out and landed in the bath.’

And that, you might think, would be  the end of it. After all, Penlington has found Prendergast — where else is there for him to go?

Quite a lot of places, it turns out. He goes to see an expert on diaries, a child psychologist and even a graphologist to get Prendergast’s handwriting analysed.

Real-live theatre: Nathan's experiences provide material for his comedy routines

By now a little worm of suspicion had begun to flex itself in my mind — the suspicion that what was driving Penlington wasn’t just an obsession, but something else. He is, after all, a stand-up comic who has performed with Ricky Gervais among others, and he clearly thinks there’s some professional mileage to be got out of his quest.

Indeed, as he reveals at the end, he’s turned the whole thing into a ‘live, interactive, real-life theatre show called Choose Your Own Documentary’. Nothing wrong with that, of course, except it does make you feel that Penlington might be a bit more hard-nosed, maybe even a bit more ruthless, than he likes to make out.

You get a sense of this in the chapter where he goes back to his childhood home in Rhyl, North Wales and looks up a girl called Nancy who he had a crush on when he was a teenager. They go to a park where Penlington has arranged for a guitarist friend of his to play Love Is All Around.

And then he shoots off back to his girlfriend in London, presumably leaving a shell-shocked Nancy to resume her life as a lonely divorcee.

One of the problems with being an obsessive collector is that you can’t stop accumulating stuff. It’s the same with this book. Somewhere in here is a fascinating and touching story, but it’s been all but buried beneath a mountain of clutter.
