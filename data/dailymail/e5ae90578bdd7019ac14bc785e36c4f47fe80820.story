President Barack Obama showed himself a perfect gentleman with Queen Elizabeth II during D-Day commemorations in Normandy Friday, tenderly helping the 88-year-old monarch down a flight of stairs.

Photographers covering the event in Chateau de Benouville, Normandy, captured Obama and New Zealand's Governor-General Jerry Mateparae guiding her majesty to her position for a group photo with other world leaders.

Many observers were quick to point out that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stood off to the right just a few steps away, did not bother to aid the elderly queen.

Obama and Queen Elizabeth were among 19 heads of state and members of royal families who attended a series of elaborate ceremonies and memorials marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

The American president and the British monarch appeared cordial during the commemorative events in France, which culminated with a dazzling fireworks display.

The two were pictured walking amiably side by side deep in conversation just a couple of steps behind President Putin and France's Francois Hollande.

The lanky commander-in-chief thoughtfully bent his 6-foot-1 frame so he could listen to his royal interlocutor.

For President Obama, the queen seemingly served as a buffer separating him from Mr Putin, whom he did not publicly acknowledge and went to great lengths to avoid.

The
 queen was equally eager to keep her distance from Putin in light of her son Prince Charles' controversial comments made last month comparing the Russian 
president to Adolf Hitler.

To be on the safe side, the queen focused all her attention on Obama.

French diplomats 
had thought long and hard about where to seat Mr Putin. The solution was
 to slot him near the top of the table but in tranquil waters away from Obama and the queen of England – between 
the Queen of Denmark and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

It was reported that Putin and Obama did eventually have a brief conversation in private on the sidelines of the lunch. 

Perhaps the only faux pas committed by the American president was that he was caught openly chewing gum throughout the meal with Queen Elizabeth seated to his left.

Obama did not fare quite as well in the presence of royalty three years ago, when he unwittingly violated the royal protocol by delivering a speech while Britain's national anthem played in the background during a state dinner in Buckingham Palace.

Toast: The Royal raised her glass with the French leader at the elaborate venue. She also said: 'Each year has  compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War'

Also, it is only a matter of time before some sharp-eyed royal observer makes hay of the fact that during the D-Day event in Normandy, President Obama lightly touched her majesty on the arm when helping her down the stairs.

According to centuries-old protocol, the queen should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake.

First Lady Michelle Obama caused an uproar in 2012 when she gently rubbed the queen's shoulder after the monarch put a friendly arm around her waist during a G20 reception.

After
 lunch Friday, the leaders made the short journey to Sword Beach. Here the 
hosts erected a vast arena where the 3rd British Infantry Division came 
ashore on D-Day morning.

The day of gratitude drew royals 
including Queen Elizabeth II of England, who dined at the French 
presidential palace in the evening, and the king of the Netherlands, 
Willem-Alexander, as well as political leaders from across Europe.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel also joined in, along with a small group of German soldiers, as a sign of European unity.

Dancers re-enacted the drama of the Nazi 
takeover and battles across Europe against Hitler's forces on a stage at
 Sword Beach, one of the landing points near Ouistreham, a small port 
where British troops landed and fought their way to Pegasus Bridge, a 
key route.

At
 least 4,400 Allied troops were killed the first day, and many thousands
 more in the ensuing Battle of Normandy that opened the Allied march to 
Paris to liberate the Nazi-occupied French capital in August. Another 
August assault was launched by forces from North Africa into southern 
France.

‘The true measure of all our actions 
is how long the good in them lasts,’ Queen Elizabeth declared in a speech during a state dinner hosted by President Hollande at Elysee Palace in Paris.

‘Each year has  
compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World 
War. Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 
700 years as they do after 70.’

Noting
 ‘the joy of becoming a great-grandmother’, the 88-year-old Queen added a
 telling sentiment that will, no doubt, be much quoted by future 
historians: ‘Everything we do, we do for the young.’
