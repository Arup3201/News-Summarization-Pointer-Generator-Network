Howling winds are responsible for these carved this outstanding series of pictures of diving dunes and swirling lines in vast desert landscapes.

Photographer Sandro Santioli snapped the intricate patterns, which were cut into the rolling plains of Namibia, Tunisia, and Morocco by the harsh winds of the desert.

The huge dunes are continually moving and being reshaped by the weather, with a mixture of straight and wavy grooves etched into the sides.

They show a huge range of golden colours, moving through yellow, orange, red and brown, depending on the placement of the sun.

Sandro, from Chianti, Tuscany, Italy, regularly travels through deserts in a 4x4 jeep as he leads photography workshops.

He said: 'Namibia has some of the highest and most beautiful dunes in the world.

'The intense red-like colour offers a high contrast against the blue sky, and its beauty stuns me every time I see it.

'The dunes are always on the move, as a mix of weak and strong winds shape them. The only things that is constant is change.'

He added: 'The most fascinating thing about taking pictures of this kind, is the endless chance to see new shapes, colours, and contrasts.

'Everything looks so infinite, like tracks, roads, and plains. All the landscape is just one single and endless view - it is breathtaking.

'These wide spaces are so extremely empty, but you don't feel alone. Instead, you feel deeply in touch with nature.

'It is like being in the middle of a huge art exhibition.'
