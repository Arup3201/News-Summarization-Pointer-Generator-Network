A man who looks just like accused cop-killer Eric Frein claims to have been stopped at gun-point and tackled to the ground repeatedly by police searching for him.

James Tully, 39, lives in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where state troopers and the FBI have been hunting for Frein since September 12, when he allegedly shot dead a state trooper, and badly wounded another.

He walks to work every day for five miles through the heart of the search zone, bringing him into daily contact with troopers trying to find the elusive Frein, who has now dodged the authorities for 39 days.

Lookalike: James Tully, left, looks like Eric Frein, who has been hunted by state police for more than five weeks after allegedly shooting dead a trooper and wounding another

Stopped: Tully, pictured walking near his workplace in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, says he has been stopped more than 20 times

Tully says overzealous officers have held him face-down in the gravel, knee in his back, while shouting at him to identify himself. He has taken to carrying photo ID everywhere to prove he is not one of America's most wanted men.

Tully, a separated father of two who works at an aerospace manufacturing firm, says he has been stopped at least 20 times. 

Speaking to the Pocono Record, he described how he was walking home Friday down Route 447, after finishing work at midnight.

Violent encounter: Tully says that one officer who stopped him late at night pointed a rifle at him and pinned him to the floor with his knee

Necessary: Tully has started wearing visible photo ID to convince police he is not Eric Frein

He was stopped twice without incident - but the third officer to spot him leaped from his SUV 'screaming like a lunatic' and aiming his rifle straight at Tully, he said.

He said: 'The only ID I saw was the barrel of the gun. He yelled at me to get down on the ground with my arms out wide and he demanded my name.'

Despite tearing the ID badge out from under Tully, the officer, he said, continued to hound him.

He allegedly said 'I will break you right here - what is your name?' while pressing down on his bad back with one knee.

After a while a state trooper who had seen Tully before pulled up and calmed the situation - and promised to tell other searchers about him. He says he was stopped three times the next day.

Survivalist: Frein, right, has been on the run from state police and the FBI for 39 days now - and has yet to be taken in despite frequent sightings

He later checked into hospital, where he was told his ribs were bruised in the encounter. 

He told the Record that due to budget constraints he doesn't have a car - and said nobody is available to give him a lift home because of his late hours.

Despite a bad knee and back, he walks to work every day - a 5-mile trip which takes him two hours each way.

Pennsylvania State Police declined to comment on any encounters with Tully, but noted that he has not filed any complaints to them.

Police have spend weeks searching for Frein in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, around where Tully lives and works.

Armed: Significant resources have been piled into tracking Frein down. Above are U.S. Marshals riding in an armored vehicle

Chopper: Even helicopters have been deployed in the hunt. Here one chopper lands in a school at the heart of the search area

But they have now shifted their primary search area 5 miles southwest after a woman out for a walk Friday night reported seeing a rifle-toting man with mud on his face near Pocono Mountain East High School.

On Monday afternoon, an officer with Pocono Mountain Regional Police spotted a man dressed in green in the woods near the Swiftwater post office, less than a half-mile from the school.

That prompted an intense police search as students were heading home for the day - a potentially volatile situation that had some parents fuming.

With classes canceled Tuesday, state police and the FBI searched the school district's Swiftwater campus, clearing and securing the high, junior high and elementary schools. 

The manhunt is now concentrated along the heavily trafficked Route 611 corridor in the heart of the Poconos. Major attractions and businesses in the vicinity include Mount Airy Casino Resort and pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur, where Frein worked briefly.

On Tuesday, police with dogs were seen searching a clothing collection bin across the street from a popular restaurant.
