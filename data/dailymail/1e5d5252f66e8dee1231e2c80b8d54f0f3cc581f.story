When bubbly blonde Gemma Collins burst onto our screens in TOWIE as a bolshy mouthpiece for plus-size women, not many people took her seriously.

But Gemma - who is often criticised for being overweight herself - has certainly had the last laugh as she celebrates not only the opening of her debut plus-size clothes shop, but also a nomination for Best Designer at the Plus-size Fashion Awards - all in the space of four weeks.

The reality star from Romford,
32, could not be more thrilled with the response she has had to Gemma’s Boutique which she opened in Brentwood, Essex at the start of the month and says her nomination is a dream come true.

'The response has been amazing. I have 
been inundated with plus-size women calling me up and thanking me for 
helping them find clothes,' she told MailOnline.

Exciting times: Gemma Collins has opened her first-ever boutique plus-size clothes shop and been nominated for Best Designer at the Plus-Size Fashion Awards this month, and she couldn't be happier (Dakota dress, £75

Gemma was inspired to open the boutique by her mother (who she was enjoying a much-needed spa day with when Femail caught up with her).

'My mum is a bigger lady and she couldn't find any clothes to fit her. There were about two shops she could go to on the high street. She just wanted to enjoy shopping but she couldn't.

'So I made it my mission to help bigger girls, I want them to be able to enjoy shopping every day,' she explained.

Describing her new boutique, which specialises in plus-size clothing for women between sizes 16 and 32, she said: 'It's not dowdy, there's lots of colour, it's vibrant and buzzy and women will leave feeling a million dollars.'

Svelte: Gemma was following a clean and lean diet programme but admits she has recently fallen off the bandwagon but looks great in her new collection (L- Cheltenham, £65, R- Somerset - £65)

Whilst she is keen to champion 'real women', Gemma can't help but admire curvy Kim Kardashian.

'I loved Kim when she was pregnant, she looked amazing; she's got it,' she says.

Gemma may love Kim but admits it's the Duchess of Cambridge that her mother wants her to emulate.

'Me and my mum were looking at the photos of Kate when she came out of hospital and we just thought she looked so happy. She is so classy.

'My mum said to me: "Why don't you start being posh and sophisticated like her?" But I just told her: "I'm always going to be Gemma from Essex, mum!"'.

Flower power: Gemma was inspired to open the boutique by her mother who found it hard to find plus-size clothes on the high-street (Shaghai dress, £60)

Kate vs Kim: Gemma's mother wants her to be classy and sophisticated like Kate but Gemma prefers Kim Kardashian and thinks she looked amazing when pregnant

Gemma admits it has been a very hectic time for her of late.

'In the space of one week, I filmed the last episode of TOWIE, moved house, my relationship broke down, and I opened the shop, so it has been very hectic.

'But I got through the pressurised time with a smile.'

And while Gemma was working hard following celebrity favourite James Duigan's Bodyism fitness regime, she admits that her busy work schedule has meant she has fallen off the bandwagon.

Still, she says she is 'comfortable in her own skin' right now.

And she has every right to be feeling confident because she has just been nominated for Best Designer at the British Plus Size awards, which will take place in November.

Speaking about the honour, she said: 'It is a dream come true, I can't believe it.

Career dreams: Gemma says she would love to star on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here (Gambia T-shirt available in black and burnt orange - £29.00)

Proud shopowner: Gemma opened her new plus size store in Brentwood, Essex at the start of the month

'I was just a normal girl from Romford who couldn't find any clothes and now I am designing my own line and have been nominated for this.

'My clothes have a high-street price point so I think that works in my favour; you just never know.'

Gemma
has been working exceptionally hard lately and on top of filming for 
TOWIE, she has designed two clothing collections and released a top 10 
book.

And still there's no stopping the outspoken blonde from Romford.

'I have got my winter line coming out and a Christmas collection with Simply Be,' she says.

'It's my mission to make big women feel good. And trust me, my new collections are drop dead gorgeous and absolutely to die for,' she added.

With rumours circulating that Joey Essex is set to head to the jungle on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, Gemma says she would love to join him.

But for now, she is focusing on fashion. Her next stop? Oxford Street.

'I want a flagship store on Oxford Street with my name in lights like on Hairspray, full of sequins and cupcakes,' she said.

Grand plans: Gemma would love to have a flagship store on Oxford Street (Mexico top, £45)

The brand new Gemma Collins’ Collection is available now from www.gemmacollinsofficial.com and in store at Gemma’s Boutique in Brentwood, Essex
