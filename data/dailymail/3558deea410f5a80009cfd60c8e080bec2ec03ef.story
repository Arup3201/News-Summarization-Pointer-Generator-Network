Filmed: Former minister Tim Yeo was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private

A senior Tory is facing calls to quit in a new lobbying scandal – after allegedly offering to help a private company influence Parliament.

Tim Yeo, the chairman of the powerful Commons energy and climate change committee, was filmed apparently bragging that he had privately coached the director of the firm – to which he has financial links – on how to influence the committee.

In reality, he was speaking to undercover reporters posing as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire him on a salary of £7,000 a day.

Mr Yeo said he could introduce them to ‘really all the key players in the UK Government’, and guide them on how to give evidence to his own committee of MPs.

The MP, who served as an environment minister in John Major’s government, has earned about £400,000 from consulting work for various green companies.

He ‘vigorously’ denied any wrongdoing last night although he pulled out of TV interviews during the day.

MPs and campaigners said the footage was ‘damning’ and called for him to stand down.

Mr Yeo, whose committee scrutinises new energy laws, was recorded at a restaurant by Sunday Times reporters posing as representatives of a solar energy firm who asked for his help.

He would have to declare such an interest, and was filmed saying he could not speak out for them in the House of Commons because ‘people will say he’s saying this because of his commercial interest’.

However, he reportedly assured them: ‘What I say to people in private is another matter altogether.’

By way of illustration, he told them how he had advised John Smith, managing director of GB Railfreight, before the executive gave evidence to the committee last month.

Westminster has been embroiled in a scandal this week about MPs and peers handing lobbyists more than 200 Parliamentary passes despite mounting concern about their influence

Mr Yeo is a paid director and shareholder of Eurotunnel, the firm’s parent company. He told the reporters: ‘I was able to tell him in advance what he should say.’

Today he sought to play down the significance of the exchange.

Mr Yeo told BBC Radio Wales: 'What happened was I travelled with the person concerned in the company of two other people, five days before his appearance before the committee, in a train.

'During that conversation I spoke very briefly to him about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee so I could explain to him that because of the business connection between us, which of course was properly declared and registered, I wouldn’t take part in questioning.'

The MP for South Suffolk has taken various paid roles at green firms since taking over the chairmanship of the committee in 2010.

He also has shares and options worth about £583,000 in low-carbon firms that have employed him. The House of Commons code of conduct prohibits members from acting as paid advocates.

He is the latest politician to be implicated in the ‘Westminster for sale’ scandal by the Sunday Times. It was revealed last week that three peers had agreed to ask parliamentary questions and lobby ministers for paying clients. Lords Mackenzie of Framwellgate, Cunningham and Laird all deny the claims.

'I intend to contest these allegations very vigorously indeed.'

Tim Yeo MP

Tory MP Margot James wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘damning’.

She said ‘paid consultancy and directorships relevant to committee work surely incompatible with chairing [a] committee’.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tim Yeo appears to have been caught red-handed in a disgusting attempt to bend the rules.

‘Mr Yeo should resign but, more importantly, the Government should reconsider its disastrous energy policies that reward this sort of behaviour.’

Mr Yeo apparently told the reporters he could commit to at least one day a month, despite already holding four private jobs and negotiating to take a further two.

He said: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I can use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections.’

Mr Yeo has referred himself to the Commons standards commissioner for the allegations to be investigated, and said he ‘totally rejects’ the claims.

He said: ‘The Sunday Times has chosen to quote very selectively from a recording obtained clandestinely during a conversation of nearly an hour and a half in a restaurant with two undercover reporters who purported to be representing a client from South Korea.

My lawyer requested the whole recording from which these extracts were obtained but this has not been given.’ He said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he had coached Mr Smith.

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He has referred himself for investigation, clearly he has to stand down while that goes on.'
