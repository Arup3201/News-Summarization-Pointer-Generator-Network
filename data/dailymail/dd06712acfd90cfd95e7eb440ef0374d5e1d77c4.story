America faced a fresh threat of another pounding from Mother Nature today as three extreme weather fronts began to sweep towards the coastline.

Tropical Storm Nate sprang to life in the western Gulf of Mexico on last night, Tropical Storm Maria formed in the Atlantic and Hurricane Katia churned up surf along Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, forecasters said.

The trio of tropical cyclones 
came during what is traditionally the busiest part of the 
June-through-November hurricane season in the Atlantic basin.

Thousands of Americans were fleeing the U.S. East Coast today after being ordered to evacuate during flash floods which have taken two lives.

Heavy rains have seen severe weather warnings issued from Maryland to New York early on Thursday morning.

In Derry Township, Pennsylvania, an elderly man trying to get water from his basement was killed when the house's foundations collapsed.

A motorist in Elizabeth Township, Pennsylvania, was also killed after becoming trapped in their vehicle early on Thursday during extreme weather.

The National Weather Service issued several flash flood warnings early Thursday for parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.

Mandatory evacuation orders were also issued across several parts of New York state as officials predicted the rain would worsen on Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

'At
this time of year we are essentially at the peak of the hurricane 
season,' said John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist at the U.S. 
National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th named 
storm of the 2011 hurricane season, was racing westward across the 
tropical Atlantic, with tropical storm watches being issued for the 
Leeward Islands, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its 
report late Wednesday.

The NHC said the government of Antigua has issued a tropical storm watch
for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis and Saint Kitts 
in the Leeward Islands.

At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles 
east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained 
winds of 50mph, the NHC added.

Maria was moving toward the west near 23mph, and 
this rapid motion is expected to continue during the next 24 hours, the 
NHC said.

Storm watch: At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained winds of 50mph

'Interests elsewhere in the Leeward Islands, The Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Maria,' the NHC said.

A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate formed in Mexico's Bay of Campeche, prompting the Mexican government to issue storm warnings for its coast from Chilitepec to Celestun.

Nate was about 125 miles west of Campeche and had sustained winds of 45mph. It was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday and move slowly north and then northwest toward the Mexican coast, the U.S. forecasters said.

Coastal residents in the warning area could start feeling its gusts and rain by Wednesday night, they said.

'Data from the Pemex oil rigs in the Bay of Campeche measured sustained winds of 43 mph gusting to 50 mph,' the U.S. forecasters said.

Crude oil futures rebounded sharply, partly on fears that Nate could disrupt U.S. and Mexican oil and natural gas operations in the Gulf. Nearly 37 per cent of U.S. oil production in the Gulf remained offline from Tropical Storm Lee's trek through the region last weekend, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said.

Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. It was a Category 4 at its peak.

Katia was centred about 335 miles west-southwest of the island of Bermuda and was expected to pass between the eastern U.S. coast and Bermuda by Thursday.

Forecasters said the core of the storm would stay out to sea but Katia was wide enough that its outer squalls could reach the shores of Bermuda, a British territory and global reinsurance hub whose 70,000 residents were under a tropical storm watch.

Danger: Even with Katia's centr likely staying well away from the U.S. coast, large swells will impact the East Coast the next few days

Taking a turn: Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm

Katia generated large swells that kicked up the surf and caused dangerous rip currents along the beaches of the Eastern United States, Bermuda and parts of the Bahamas, the forecasters said.

Once past Bermuda, Katia was forecast to curve eastward over open seas where it would pose no further threat until it nears Scotland on Monday. By then it will no longer be a tropical system, but could spread out into a larger storm.

'It'll likely be a very big, significant weather system,' Cangialosi said. 'It will evolve into a classic wintertime storm by the time it gets there.'
