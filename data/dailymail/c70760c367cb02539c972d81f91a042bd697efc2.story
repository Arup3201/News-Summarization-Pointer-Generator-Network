Former President Jimmy Carter recently said he 'could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons we had' during the Iranian hostage crisis.

Carter also claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible.

Carter made the remarks during an episode of CNBC Meets after Tania Bryer asked him 'Do you feel there were any choices you would have made differently?'

'I think I would have been re-elected easily if I had been able to rescue our hostages from the Iranians,' Carter said on the program. 'And everybody asks me what would do more, I would say I would send one more helicopter because if I had one more helicopter we could have brought out not only the 52 hostages, but also brought out the rescue team, and when that failed, then I think that was the main factor that brought about my failure to be re-elected. So that's one thing I would change.'

Carter also said 'I could've been re-elected if I'd taken military action against Iran, shown that I was strong and resolute and, um, manly and so forth.

'But, er, I think if I, I could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons that we had, but in the process a lot of innocent people would have been killed, probably including the hostages and so I stood up against all that, er, all that advice, and then eventually my prayers were answered and every hostage came home safe and free. And so I think I made the right decision in retrospect, but it was not easy at the time.' 

Carter lost in the 1980 presidential election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.

The fifty-two hostages were eventually released in January 1981. Sixty-six Americans were originally taken hostage from a US embassy in November 1979, CNN reported. 

Carter also celebrated his 90th birthday Wednesday in Atlanta, blowing out three candles representing the past, present and future and thanking family and friends for their support and love.

'It's been a good first 90 years,' the 39th president joked before telling the crowd gathered in a chapel on The Carter Center grounds that he is looking forward to much more work. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded the international health and human rights organization after leaving the White House.

Not 'manly' enough? Carter, seen here with his family in 1980, claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible

Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. 

Carter said his life was most shaped by his marriage to Rosalynn and growing up in Plains, Georgia, where he worked and played with black children who didn't have the same rights as he because of their race. Carter said he still feels guilt for not realizing sooner how wrong that was.

Being elected president, he said, was the highlight of his political life. However, he said he's had the 'best times' of his life since establishing The Carter Center, 'this beautiful place on earth that has set moral and ethical standards that exemplify what a superpower like America ought to be.' 

Rosalynn Carter choked up while introducing her husband, telling him she's proud of him for both his work and the family they built together. As for what's next, Rosalynn Carter said only one thing is certain.

'It will be something because Jimmy Carter is miserable if he's not doing something,' she said, laughing with the crowd.

Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. He was born 111 days after President George H.W. Bush, who celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this year.
