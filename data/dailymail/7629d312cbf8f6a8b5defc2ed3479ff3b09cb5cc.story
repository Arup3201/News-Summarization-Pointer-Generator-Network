A man was killed after his dog pressed down on the accelerator of his car and ran him over.

James Campbell, 68, had got out of his car to open metal gates at the driveway to his Florida home when the accident happened.

As he stood by the gates his pet bulldog jumped into the well of the driver's seat and pressed down on the accelerator.

The vehicle surged backwards and trapped him under its wheels.

The victim's partner 56 year old Iris Fortner had desperately tried to stop the car before it backed into Campbell.

She was in the driver's seat but was unable to prevent the accident.

Florida Highway Patrol officials said the accident took place outside the couple's home in Cantonment in Florida's Panhandle.

Campbell and Fortner were backing into their driveway when he got out to open their gates.

When Fortner opened her door to see where Campbell was standing police said their large boxer bull dog jumped into the car and pressed the accelerator.

The car was engaged in reverse gear and shot backwards hitting Campbell who was pronounced dead at the scene by Escambia County Emergency Medical Services.

Fortner has not been charged.
