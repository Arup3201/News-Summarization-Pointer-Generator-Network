Koalas are generally seen as some of the cuddliest critters Australia has to offer, but a recent video from a Brisbane sanctuary shows they have a tougher side, too.

The clip, uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, shows two Koala's embroiled in a vicious fight inside Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, tussling each other across the enclosure while a zoo keeper tries using a rake to keep them apart.

But Lone Pine koala keeper Karen Nilsson said the said the behaviour is commonplace during mating season, when the animals argue over breeding, reports Nine News.

The male koala, Mr Peabody, is the only male koala in the sanctuary permitted to mate. He is believed to have made an unwanted advance on his female neighbour.

'She didn't appreciate him being there because she's not ready to mate. She was just trying to send him on his way,' Ms Nilsson said.

'He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was actually a very polite little tiff. Both are 100 percent fine – no injuries whatsoever. Whatever the issue was, they've sorted it out and moved on.'

Ms Nilsson said the rake is used by keepers in order to keep the animals apart without risking harm. But the animals rarely hurt each other during the tiffs.

'Sometimes they get little bite marks on the ears but it's pretty minor. Once the hierarchy is established, they get on really well,' she said.

Fighting among koalas is common for males, who use the fights as a means of climbing the hierarchy.

Females will generally only fight during mating season if males make an unwanted advance.
