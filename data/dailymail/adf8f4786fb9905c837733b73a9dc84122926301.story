An incredible 232.08-carat white diamond of 'exceptional size and clarity' has been unearthed at a mine in South Africa, with a possible value of £10million.

The dazzling D colour Type II diamond was found by Petra Diamonds at its Cullinan mine in South Africa, with four analysts predicting a £10million price tag.

Type II diamonds, which are formed over long periods of time, tend to be large and irregular in shape and have no measurable nitrogen impurities.

This means they are often of top quality in terms of colour and clarity.

Valuable: An incredible 232.08-carat white diamond has been unearthed at a mine in South Africa

Meanwhile, D colour stones are known for being the most colourless, and therefore the most sought after and costly.

The Cullinan mine is famed for the largest rough gem diamond ever recovered, the 3,106 carat Cullinan Diamond found in 1905, which was cut into stones that are part of Britain's Crown Jewels. 

A spokesman described the newly-found stone as 'a magnificent example of the large, high quality diamonds for which the mine is known.'

The recent find is Petra's largest white diamond since it unearthed the 507-carat Cullinan Heritage in 2009 from the same mine. 

That rough white diamond was given a 'flawless' clarity grade and fetched $35.3million (£21million), a record price for the company.

'We estimate a sales price in the order of $10million to $15million (£10million), given Gem Diamonds' recent sale of Type II white at about $70,000 per carat and assuming some losses for cutting/polishing,' Numis Securities analysts said in a note.

Start saving: Petra said it expected the diamond to be sold between October and December

Formed over long periods of time, Type II diamonds tend to be large and irregular in shape.

They have no measurable nitrogen impurities that cause a yellow or brown colour in other diamonds. 

This means they are often of top quality in terms of colour and clarity.

They are also rarer than Type I stones, which are the most common class of diamond and contain atoms as their main impuritiy. 

D colour stones are known for being the most colourless, and are therefore the most sought after and costly.

'The extra revenue would go straight to the bottom line', Numis said.

Petra, which reported revenue of about $473million (£290million) in the previous financial year, declined to specify how much the diamond could fetch.

A company spokesman told Reuters the stone would most likely be snapped up by a buyer from traditional diamond hubs such as the United States, Europe, Israel or China, who could cut the stone into polished gems.

'It's more a case of the clients coming to us, rather than us needing to approach clients,' he said.

Petra said it expected the diamond to be sold in October-December, the second quarter of its financial year.

Investors are also awaiting the outcome Petra's sale of a rare 122.52-carat blue diamond recovered from Cullinan this year. Analysts have pegged the stone's value at more than $35million. The sale period closes on Friday.

Rock on: The enormous sparkler was found by Petra Diamonds Ltd at its Cullinan mine in South Africa

The miner, with five producing mines in South Africa and one in Tanzania, sold a 29.6 carat blue diamond to U.S. luxury jeweller Cora International in February for $25.6million.

Petra has in the past year retrieved some large blue diamonds from Cullinan, which was one of the five non-core mines it bought from Anglo American Plc's De Beers unit - the world's biggest diamond producer by value.

Shares in the diamond miner, which operates primarily in South Africa, climbed as much as seven per cent to a high of 189.2 pence in early trading, the biggest rise on Britain's FTSE 250 Midcap Index on Tuesday.
