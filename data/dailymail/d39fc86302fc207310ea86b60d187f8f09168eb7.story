Despite warnings of rainstorms for the fourth year in a row, revellers refused to have their spirits dampened at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade in Sydney.

Parade goers gathered from across Australia, as the 114 floats of the gay and lesbian parade made their way through the city.

This year, the parade reprised its past as a protest march with several of the floats making fun of Russian leader Vladimir Putin's conservative views on sexuality, and the so-called 'anti-gay' sentiment in his administration.

Many of the city's public officials and political hopefuls turned out to show their support, with many of the participants having a deeply personal relationship to the protest parades.

The police in Sydney also made an increased effort this year, eager to not repeat the mistakes that happened at last year's celebrations, when the peaceful demonstration turned to brutality with the arrest of Jamie Jackson Reed.

Director of the Hollywood picture 'The Great Gatsby' Baz Luhrmann designed the final float, which was strictly ballroom-themed, and both he and singer Ricky Martin watched from the stands.

While the weather was not quite bikini-hot, it didn't stop the most flamboyant crowd of Sydney from adorning themselves with sequins and g-strings in their scantily clad attire for the entire day

The parade also served as a great opportunity for a sounding board for those opposing the anti-gay policies put in place in Putin's Russia. These objections were clearly demonstrated by the giant Putin figures that were led through the streets during the parade

Ten Thousand marchers along with 144 floats entered in the 36th parade, with many of the floats decrying the anti-gay sentiments pushed by the Putin administration. The pride parade was a chance for objectors to voice their displeasure with many resorting to wry take-downs of Putin on floats

The party that originated from the beginnings of the parade carried on long into the night, with many public officials in the city not only endorsing the activity, but taking part in the festivities

Sydney police ordered a high-visibility operation to be launched, with officers vowing to work better with event organisers in order to avoid the brutality that occurred the in the same celebrations the year before

Last year, the gay pride demonstrations turned to brutality when teenager Jamie Jackson Reed was filmed being arrested and slammed to the ground by a police officer after accusations of violent behavior. An eventual lawsuit by Reed led to him getting $40,000 in compensation

The last sunny Mardi Gras Gay Pride parade took place in 2010, and every year since has been hit by rain and wet weather. But every year, the hundreds of people that turn out for the event refused to let the weather dampen their spirits, with this year being no exception

The parade travelled through the city of Sydney with over 100 floats, with either end dominated by scenes of partying, celebrating gay rights and protesting against subjugation

The party and parade was also used as a meeting place for the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, who came together to celebrate freedom in their country and protest anti-gay legislation in others
