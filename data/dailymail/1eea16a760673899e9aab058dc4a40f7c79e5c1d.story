The victims of a burglary captured their alleged intruders after spotting them in the street - on the way back from another break-in.

The Wyatt family's surveillance system filmed the moment a woman and two men took two TVs and numerous Christmas presents from their home in Warrior, Alabama, last Friday.

Just two days later, Chris Wyatt spotted the suspects' Ford Ranger pickup truck driving down a road and swerved to block them into a corner.

Vigilante justice: The group held a woman and two men at gunpoint until the sheriff's deputies arrived

Mr Wyatt, his wife Sarah, and two other relatives ordered them out of the car - apparently full of stolen goods - and held them at gunpoint until police arrived.

According to Chief Deputy Randy Christian, officers received the 911 call on Sunday afternoon while they were interviewing the victims of another burglary.

When they reached Mr Wyatt and his detainees, they found the computer monitor, trumpet, knife collection and jewelry that the second victim reported missing. 

The case is the latest of vigilante justice in Alabama, where home surveillance systems have soared in popularity over the past two years.

After realizing they had been burglarized on Friday, the Wyatts watched the security reel which showed a woman knocking on the door. 

When there was no answer, she appeared to break through a window with two men before lugging out numerous items.

The next day Mr Wyatt posted the footage on Facebook and said that he vowed to find the intruders, commenting: 'guns out and loaded'.

But their vengeance came sooner than expected when he spotted the car from the video just hours later.

'They happened to drive by and we seen them drive by and we knew it was them and we stopped them,' Chris Wyatt told WSFA.

Relieved: Mr Wyatt said he was shocked to find the suspects' car had more stolen goods inside it

'They tried to say that they were lost and we corrected them where they were.'

Deputies have yet to confirm the identities of the three people detained on Sunday afternoon and no charges have been brought.

Incredibly, their vehicle appeared to be full of items stolen from another family.

Mr Wyatt said: 'They broke into another house an hour before this and luckily their stolen stuff was still in that vehicle.'
