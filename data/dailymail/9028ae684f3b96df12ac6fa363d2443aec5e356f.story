Scientists at Cardiff University have made a breakthrough in a study of the heart defect which almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba

Scientists have discovered the cause of a heart defect which almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba.

The breakthrough in understanding Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could now pave the way for new drugs and a cure.

The heart condition kills dozens of young people every year, because until now experts have been unable to pinpoint the cure.

But heart specialists at Cardiff University found two vital proteins in heart cells are to blame for the previously inexplicable cause of death.

A rare genetic mutation in some people causes the two proteins to 'not communicate' with each other.

Professor Tony Lai, from Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: 'A healthy and regular heartbeat is maintained by precise control of the calcium level in heart muscle cells.

'But our experiments have identified a genetic flaw that invites chaos to this process.'

His colleague Dr Michail Nomikos explained why the heart’s biological equilibrium becomes unstable.

He said: 'When calcium levels rise the heart contracts - and when the calcium levels drop the heart muscle relaxes, similar to the upstroke and downstroke of a motor engine.

'The precise control of this movement relies on the direct physical interaction between a calcium channel protein ryanodine receptor and a calcium-sensing protein called calmodulin.

'We discovered that a genetic mutation in calmodulin causes a loss of regular heart rhythm and produces ineffective communication between the two proteins.

He added: 'Abnormal changes in calcium levels disrupt the smooth cycling between cardiac contraction and relaxation that leads to irregular heartbeat and sudden death.'

The Cardiff scientists say drugs could be developed to give doctors a new weapon in the fight against sudden cardiac death.

Gabby Logan’s brother, Daniel Yorath, was 15 when he suddenly collapsed and died during a kick around with his father, former Wales and Bradford City manager Terry Yorath, at the family home in Leeds in 1992.

Match of the Day presenter Gabby later launched the Daniel Yorath appeal in his memory.

Fabrice
 Muamba was playing for Bolton Wanderers in an FA Cup tie against 
Tottenham in March 2012 when his heart stopped for 78 minutes.

After his recovery he supported campaigns to prevent deaths from sudden cardiac arrests.

Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate 
Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Keeping the 
heart’s calcium levels under control is critical to maintaining a 
healthy rhythm.

'By showing how calmodulin mutation could disrupt this and lead to sudden cardiac death, the Cardiff team have provided new clues for how to treat the condition in the future.

'Uncovering genetic links like this is vital to help combat the devastating effects of inherited heart conditions.

'We are urgently campaigning for more research to help find the undiscovered faulty genes putting people at greater risk of heart disease.'

Dr Steve Cox, Deputy Chief Executive of Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY), said: 'Young sudden cardiac death is caused by many different conditions, not all of which are genetic.

'However, significant progress is being made in genetics and we hope this research will result in practices that can reduce the incidence of young sudden cardiac death.

'In 80 per cent of young sudden deaths there are no prior symptoms, which is why CRY campaigns for all young people to have the opportunity to be tested.

'Our screening programme currently tests around 15,000 young people every year - and one in every 300 people we test has a potentially life threatening condition identified.

'We will continue to lobby for greater access to free screening, especially for young people regularly involved in sport, even at a grass roots level.'
