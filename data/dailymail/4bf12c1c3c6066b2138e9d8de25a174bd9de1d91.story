After a career spent bringing other people’s stories to life, it is his own story  that is perhaps the most touching of all.

Film director Richard Attenborough is as much in love  with his wife Sheila Sim as he was seven decades ago, according to those close to the pair.

And the besotted couple, who have neighbouring rooms in a care home, still hold hands every day.

Devoted: Lord Richard Attenborough and Lady Sheila Sim pictured in 2008, have been together for 72 years

Lord Attenborough, who celebrates his 90th birthday today,  lives with Lady Attenborough,  91, in a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west London.

The director, who won eight Oscars for his 1982 epic Gandhi, has been in a wheelchair since  suffering a stroke five years ago.

At a screening of Lord Attenborough’s 1993 movie Shadowlands to commemorate the filmmaker’s landmark birthday, his close friend and former colleague Terence Clegg said: ‘I saw him just on Friday, he’s frail, he’s very quiet now but he’s lovely and he’s in good hands.

‘He’s being well looked after and he just holds Sheila’s hand and they’re as much in love today as they were 72 years ago. I’m happy to say he’s really in good form.’

Back in the days: Young and in love, the couple are pictured in 1952

Lord Attenborough met his actress wife when they were  students at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in  London and co-starred in a play.

They went on to have three children together. Michael, 63, is a  theatre director and Charlotte, 54, became an actress. Their elder daughter, Jane, and her daughter Lucy died in the 2004 South Asian Boxing Day tsunami.

During the screening, which took place at the BAFTA headquarters in London, Michael said: ‘My parents met 72 years ago and they’re actually in a home now because they need a lot of nursing care, but they’re in rooms next door to each other.

‘Dad’s on her right hand side and Gerald [Lady Attenborough’s brother] is in a room on her left. So she’s in the middle of her brother and her husband. I think it’s a minor miracle to hold a marriage together for that length of time.

‘They met at RADA, and to hold a marriage together, in our business of all businesses.’

Together forever: Richard and Sheila live in neighboring rooms at a care home for entertainers

Michael, who hosted a party at the weekend to celebrate both  his father’s 90th and his mother’s 91st birthdays, added: ‘It’s horrid to see someone whose life was so much based around activity and around articulacy having lost the capacity to do both. 

‘But it was still clear to me yesterday that he knew exactly what was happening and I told him that I was coming here and he was very touched that BAFTA was honouring his 90th birthday in such a way.’

Also at the screening on Tuesday was William Nicholson, who wrote the screenplay for Shadowlands and was behind the film adaptation of Les Miserables.

He said: ‘We do live in a world now where a lot of directors seem to think the way to create good film is through fear, through creating an atmosphere of great tension and I have experienced this myself.

‘And I just love it that [Lord Attenborough] made his great films through the opposite method. This is not the Lord Sugar school of filmmaking, and thank God  for that, because what a miserable world it would be if we had  to endure that.’
