Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has called for Labour to introduce a 'death tax'

A 'death tax' should be introduced on old people's homes to raise more cash from children who 'win the lottery' with their inheritance, Labour grandee David Blunkett has claimed.

The former Home Secretary said it was unfair for people in London and the South East to inherit a fortune from their parents simply because of the soaring property market in and around the capital.

Mr Blunkett said the previous Labour government's proposed 'death tax' to pay for care in old age had 'a lot of merit' and should be revisited.

Labour was forced to abandon plans for a 10 per cent levy on estates to pay for social care before the 2010 general election after the Tories walked away from cross party talks on the issue.

But speaking at a Policy Exchange event in London, the former Labour frontbencher said he still backed the policy.

He said: 'I'm also interested in a much more refined, properly monitored equity release scheme because I think those who have got considerable capital assets – and certainly in London and south east because of property prices they have – [should do more].'

'Let me be really controversial: Why should their sons and daughters or nephews and nieces win the lottery when they die?

'Because that's what it amounts to compared with people in the rented sector and particularly in low terraced housing, even if they own it, in the North and Midlands.'

Asked if he meant the 'death tax' – as the Tories dubbed the proposed levy before the 2010 election – Mr Blunkett said 'yes', according to the Telegraph.

He said: 'I think that it's got a lot of merit – properly organised, properly regulated so it's not fraudulent – where people could release some of the equity to pay for their care and still allow their offspring or their nieces and nephews to inherit a pretty good bung.

'At the moment, the capital divide in this country is growing and it's going to have social consequences in the long run.'

Labour was forced to abandon plans for a 10 per cent levy on estates to pay for social care before the 2010 general election. The Tories have instead introduce a cap on social care

Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, last year said he wanted to 'embrace' a system where social care is funded by imposing a tax on estates when people die

The Coalition has rejected proposals to impose a charge on people's estates to pay for old-age care – promising instead to set a legal limit on the sums that residents can be charged for care.

Ministers claims the cap will stop people having sell their homes in old age and help create an insurance market where people can cover themselves for the future cost of round-the-clock care.

The Government has set a cap on care costs, meaning no-one will have to pay more than £72,000 before the Government steps in.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, last year said he wants Labour to 'embrace' a system where social care is funded by imposing a tax on estates when people die.

Mr Blunkett praised Mr Burnham for being 'brave' in 'coming back' to the policy.
