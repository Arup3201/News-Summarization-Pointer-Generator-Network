As airports begin their single busiest day of the holiday period, Gatwick has warned travellers that while festive cheer is welcome on planes many items we associate with Christmas are not.

London's Gatwick Airport has issued a warning to 64,000 people leaving via the airport today, Sunday, December 21, pulling party poppers on planes is top of their list of no-nos.

The airport's Christmas and New Year travel guide for those escaping Blighty for the snow or sunnier climes tells passengers to pack poppers in their bags, and leave them there, while Christmas crackers should go in their checked luggage.

And those who attempt to circumvent the rules will find themselves frisked and their bags searched by security as part of strict anti-terrorism measure.  

'People should also not take wrapped Christmas presents on board the plane as hand luggage as security staff may ask to unwrap them,' an airport spokesman said.

'We are also advising passengers that seasonal treats such as cranberry sauce, pickles, mince meat, jam, marmalade and other jellies, tubs of clotted cream, custard and brandy sauce, all fall under liquid rules meaning anything over 100ml must go in the hold.'

A Christmas tree adds festive cheer to Gatwick's terminal, which will have 64,000 departures today

Gatwick alone expects more than 1.7 million passengers to travel through the airport between December 19 and January 5. 

For the second consecutive year Geneva, a gateway to many popular ski resorts, Barcelona and Dublin are the most popular destinations for travellers from the airport south of London.

Christmas day itself will see more than 15,000 passengers arriving and departing from the airport while 64,000 passengers are flying out on Sunday.

December 21 is the busiest day for departures of the festive calendar

It's not all bah humbug around the West Sussex runways though, with a gospel choir, a Santa brass band and a Frank Sinatra tribute act among the performers at the airport today.

Up to four million Britons will head overseas during this festive period, estimates the travel association Abta,  slightly higher than the number who travelled abroad for Christmas last year.

Heathrow, the busiest departure point, is expecting nearly 700,000 passengers to leave from the London airport between December 19 and Christmas Day.
