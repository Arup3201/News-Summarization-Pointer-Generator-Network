Newcastle United have hit back at Gary Lineker’s accusation they are delaying their appointment of a new head coach in order to avoid signing any new players in January.

The former England captain tweeted: ‘Brilliant tactics from Newcastle board to delay appointing their new manager so they don’t have to buy any players in the transfer window.’

The Magpies are still searching for Alan Pardew’s successor and it is likely that John Carver will remain in caretaker charge until the summer.

But managing director Lee Charnley said: ‘I saw the stuff Gary Lineker tweeted saying we’re hanging back from appointing a head coach so we don’t have to sign anyone which isn’t correct. Are we delaying to get through the January window? Absolutely not.

‘In all honesty, the January window is not one we ever envisaged being particularly active in. That’s partly because of the amount of business we did in the summer but also because January is a difficult market to operate in.’

Charnley, meanwhile, has given the clearest indication yet that United will not appoint a new boss until the end of the season.

‘We see this as a long-term decision,’ he said.

‘We’ve got a number of options and clearly my preference is to try and find someone to bring in now.

‘However, because it will be a long-term commitment, if I have to wait until the summer for what I believe is the right individual then I would rather wait than actually take someone now who I think isn’t the best fit.

‘I’m not going to take someone who is free and available now if we have a better option and options by waiting until the end of the season. I know that won’t be an entirely popular point of view but for me that is the most sensible thing to do. It is about the medium to long term and ensuring we get the “right one”.’
