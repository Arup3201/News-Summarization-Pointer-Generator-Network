Four women had to be rescued when their car turned off a coastal road and plunged into the sea – after the driver followed directions from a sat nav.

The holidaymakers, from London, were attempting to find a seaside village pub in Angle, near Pembroke, west Wales, in the dark when the device instructed them to turn right.

They travelled past a sign saying ‘No Through Road’, before their hire car suddenly fell into the sea.

A Coastguard spokesman said: 'The women followed the instructions of their sat nav and took a wrong turning. We had a call to say that a car had gone into the water and helped the women onto dry land'

Coastguards found the women still in the hire car and helped them back onto dry land.

A spokesman said: ‘The women followed the instructions of their sat nav and took a wrong turning.

‘We had a call to say that a car had gone into the water, and luckily we located it and helped the women onto dry land.’

The four were uninjured and managed to get a lift to the Old Point House pub, which they had been searching for all along.

Landlady Alycia Watkins said: ‘They got quite a ribbing from the locals.

‘They were definitely in need of a stiff drink or two.’
