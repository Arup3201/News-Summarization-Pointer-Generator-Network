A grieving mother was devastated when she tried to collect her dead son’s clothes from police, but was given a bag full of rubbish instead.

Diane Down, 49, thought she was going to collect the possessions of her son Sam Down, who died aged 18 in mysterious circumstances in 2007.

Sam was staying at a friend’s house when he was found slumped unconscious with a cut on his head, and was later pronounced dead.

Mrs Down said receiving the bag of rubbish from police was 'heart-breaking' and 'insulting'

Mrs Down was expecting to pick up the clothes her son was wearing when he died, but was instead confronted by a mess of dirty tissues, cigarette butts, grubby newspapers, food wrappers and empty cans and bottles.

Bungling members of Thames Valley Police had given her a bag of rubbish from the house where he died, which was used as evidence.

Mrs Down, who has fought for years to find out more about her son’s death, described the blunder as ‘heart-breaking’.

The black sack of rubbish was recovered from the house where Sam died, and was given to Mrs Down by mistake

She said: ‘I’m absolutely distraught. I had plucked up the courage to finally go and pick up my son’s possessions and this is what they have given me to remember him by.

‘There is nothing here even remotely connected to my son for me to treasure.

‘I thought it was going to be his clothes and they would smell of him. It was a very personal thing for me - I wanted to be able to touch them and hold them again.

The blunder was another blow to Mrs Down, who has tried for years to find out more about how her son died

‘But they literally gave me a bag of stinking rubbish. It’s just heart-breaking.’

The police mistake came after Mrs Down, who also has four daughters had fought a six-year battle to get answers about how her son died unexpectedly in October 2007.

Sam, a trainee scaffolder, was found 
dead the day after a party at a friend’s house close to his family home 
in Stantonbury, near Milton Keynes.

An
inquest into his death heard how Sam’s friend, Elliot Cooper-Carroll, 
woke up in the morning and noticed he was slumped unconscious on the 
floor with a cut on his head.

But Elliot and his mother did 
not call an ambulance until four hours after they noticed Sam’s 
injuries, the inquest heard.

In the meantime, 
the family had bagged up rubbish from the night before and even sat down
to eat bacon sandwiches for lunch before eventually calling 999.

Eighteen-year-old Sam Down was a trainee scaffolder, and died after going to a party at a friend's house

Sam was pronounced dead as soon as he arrived at hospital.

A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death for Sam, which Diane has been fighting ever since.

Mrs Down opened her own investigation 
into her son’s death and even hired a private toxicology expert to 
disprove that Sam had been high on drugs.

The
Independent Police Complaints Commission later ruled that Thames Valley
Police had made mistakes in their original inquiry, but the case has 
never been re-opened.

The rubbish was collected as evidence from the house where Sam died in 2007

Mrs Down took her case to the High Court, but it was ruled that a fresh inquest could not be held because vital forensic evidence had been destroyed.

Once she had exhausted all her options to pursue answers, she asked to collect Sam’s possessions which had been left with police.

Describing the moment she collected 
the bag, she said: ‘The woman put it on the table and I felt the sealed 
bag. I expected it to be soft because I was expecting clothes.

‘But
it felt hard so I said to her “what is it?” She said “I don’t know”. It
had Sam’s name and case number on a tag, though, so I took it.

Mrs Down thought the bag contained Sam's clothes as it was labelled with his name and case number

'I didn’t want to open it there because I wanted privacy. I know he was wearing a blue hoodie, jeans and a black Ted Baker tee shirt because I washed them all ready for him to go out that night.'

'To be given a bag of rubbish is just insulting.'

Superintendent Barry Halliday apologised for the mistake, and pledged to deliver the correct package to the distraught mother.

He said: 'I express my sincere apologies for this situation'.

'My staff fully understand how difficult this must be for families and all efforts are made to examine the contents fully before release but on this occasion, for understandable reasons, this was not possible.

'Having reviewed this case carefully, the police still have an item of clothing belonging to Sam and I will ensure this is delivered to Mrs Down as soon as possible.'
