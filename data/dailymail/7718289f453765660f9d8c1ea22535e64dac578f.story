Cheerios is bringing back its famous interracial family for a Super Bowl ad in the cereal's first spot during the game in eight years.

The General Mills cereal company stirred controversy when they released the ad last year featuring bi-racial actress Grace Colbert, prompting the company to permanently disable comments on the video's YouTube page after several racist reactions.

But overall the ad was extremely successful and most came out to defend Cheerios' depiction of a diverse American family. As of Wednesday the original ad had garnered over 74,000 likes on YouTube compared to less than 3,000 dislikes.

She's back: Child actress Grace Colbert will star in a second Cheerios ad at this year's Super Bowl. This latest ad has her talking to her dad about getting a new baby brother

Precocious: After learning that she's getting a new baby brother, Grace gets her dad to agree to getting her a dog

The first ad shows little Grace going up to her white mom seated at the kitchen table, asking her if Cheerios are really good for your heart.

Her mom says the whole grains can help lower cholesterol and Grace shuffles away mischievously.

The next shot shows her black dad waking up from a nap on the couch with a mound of cereal on his chest.

In the new ad released Tuesday, Grace is at the table with Dad this time as he explains (using Cheerios of course) how she will soon be getting a baby brother.

The precocious little girl uses the Cheerios like chips and raises her father's one baby to a dog as well and he agrees.

'Cheerioes is about families and love and connections and breakfast,' said Camille Gibson, VP of marketing for Big G cereals, on the General Mills corporate blog. 'Our new Cheerios ad celebrates one of those special moments in a family that America fell in love with. The ad quietly celebrates the emotional sharing and simple joys we find when spending just a few simple moments together every day.'

Some criticized the ad and it's sequel because they believe General Mills is exploiting race to sell cereal.

But Peter Moore Smith, the executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi, the ad agency that produced the commercial, doesn't agree.

'If we’re milking anything,' he told the New York Times, 'it’s this delightful little actress...a little girl’s special relationship with her dad.'
