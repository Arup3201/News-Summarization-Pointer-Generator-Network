Christopher Eagles has been jailed for two years after he chiselled away at a wall to make a hole which he used to steal £10,000 of gold and pottery

A burglar chiselled his way through the wall of a jewellers shop before making off with £10,000 of gold and pottery.

Christopher Eagles, 50, spent hours making the two ft hole in the nine inch thick brick wall at the back of Church Street Gold in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

But the prolific burglar, who has 50 previous convictions, was caught after detectives recognised him from CCTV.

He has now been jailed for two years after admitting the burglary in June.

Owner Paul Wood, 48, from Stoke-on-Trent, said the shop was 'totally trashed'.

He said: 'I came into the shop in the morning and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was in shock.

'There was a hole in the wall of my office which had been chiselled away and clearly was how he got in.

'It
would have been a tight squeeze - only enough room for someone quite 
small. I thought at first they must have sent a child in.

'The
shop was totally trashed, with glass and bricks everywhere. I couldn’t 
understand it because I have good security - bars on the window and CCTV
in every room.'

Eagles had spent the hours before the raid chipping away at the external wall, which was accessible by an alley way and had created the hole as a way to sneak into the jewellers.

He stole £10,000 of gold jewellery, porcelain and pottery from the jewellers and caused significant damage during the break in.

Police later found some of the stolen 
pottery displayed on the mantlepiece at the house of Eagles’ heroin 
addict girlfriend, Victoria Walters.

Mr Wood said: 'I was in shock for days after the raid.

'He had stolen cash from the office, jewellery, figurines, and smashed open a safe in the back room.

'Watching the CCTV footage back, I saw him go up to the cameras and turn them all away. He didn’t try to break them though or steal the hard drive so I handed it over to the police straight away.

'I’m glad they have both been jailed, but they will be out before I know it and I fear they will come after me again.

'It has cost me thousands of pounds to repair the damage, and although I did get some of the items back, the psychological impact has been the worst.

'One of my staff left shortly afterwards,
which may have been for the best. I would rather if they come back that
none of my staff have to suffer.'

Owner Paul Wood has said he has been left in fear following the burglary in June

Mr Wood said he has now been left in fear
after the burglary, which happened in June. He said it has taken him 
four months to return the shop back to normal.

Eagles was jailed for two years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown court after admitting the burglary.

Judge Paul Glenn, said: 'The property was stolen in a professionally-executed shop burglary committed by Christopher Eagles. The police then recovered items of high value, almost the entire haul from the burglary.'

Jailing Walters for 12 months for handling stolen goods, the judge said: 'You and Eagles plainly planned to make a significant amount of money had you not been caught with the property.'
