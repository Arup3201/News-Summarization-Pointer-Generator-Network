The University of Engineering and Technology in Peru has created the first advertising billboard in the world to make drinking water out of thin air.

The breakthrough is designed to inspire more young people to pursue careers in engineering.

It is also meant to show how technology can be used to solve local problems and not always an eyesore in the shape of... billboards.

Peru: The first advertising billboard in the world to make drinking water out of thin air

The university came up with the idea to transform the country's high levels of humidity into water in conjunction with ad agency Mayo DraftFCB, the website bigthink.com reported.

Lima, the capital of Peru, is the second largest capital in the world that’s located in a desert and access to drinking water is a problem to its 7 million people. Over a million have no access to running water at all and rely on private companies to deliver to their homes.

The city is part of a coastal desert of Atacama, the driest in the world. It depends on drainage from the Andes as well as runoff from glacier melt — both sources on the decline because of climate change.

Due to the extremely dry climate, annual precipitation is less than 1 inch, many people draw water from wells that are often polluted – worldwide 2.2 million people die every year from drinking contaminated water.

On the other hand, the atmospheric humidity in Lima is about 98 per cent.

The billboard requires electricity to power five generators that make up the billboard’s inverse osmosis filtration system,  capturing the air humidity, condensing and purifying the water, and filling it up in 20 litre tanks.

The water is then transported through small ducts to a central holding tank at the billboard’s base, where there is a water faucet.

How it works: through an air filter into a condenser. From there to another filter and into tanks which let the water flow into a faucet

The billboard has already produced 9,450
 liters of water in just three months, according to Mayo, which it says 
equals the water consumption of 'hundreds of families per month'.

The university hopes the billboard will lead to more billboards: dozens, hundreds or even thousands of billboards, strategically placed in the city or out-lying villages, might provide enough water for the whole city.

Rain is rare but many in the capital don't have direct access to water and rely on deliveries
