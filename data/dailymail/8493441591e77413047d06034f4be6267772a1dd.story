Stevens will appear in court on Thursday after police issued an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) on behalf of Meares. Just last week the couple put on a united front at the David Jones Autumn/Winter fashion launch

Just last Wednesday the pair presented a united front at a David Jones fashion event in Sydney. 

According to reports from Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of James Packer discovered text messages on Jon's phone. Jodhi is believed to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the police were called to the couples' home after the fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped. 

The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds. 

Only last week Jon and Jodhi seemed to be very much together, with the musician lashing out at detractors online, in defence of his fiancee Jodhi in some fiery posts on Facebook. 

Meares' last social media post (pictured), uploaded onto her Instagram page on Tuesday night, was a motivational logo

Last week the couple were in the audience of the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch. It was Meares' first public appearance since the drink driving scandal (pictured) that plagued the latter half of her 2014

Happier times: Meares' Instagram page is full of pictures and selfies of Stevens, including this one from a week ago, captioned: 'My Johnny- playing me a new song he's been working on. Oh to be that talented'

Last week the 43-year-old was spotted wearing both an engagement and wedding ring while out in Rose Bay

It is yet another public drama Jodhi Meares will feel she could do without after her drink driving crash in June 2014.

The fashion designer appeared in court in August, but escaped with just a 12-month driving ban and a fine for $1,100, despite recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181 and rolling her Range Rover.

Her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb. 

At the time, her solicitor Chris Murphy said Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to Packer, which lasted from 1999 until they separated in 2002. 

'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said  about it [the marriage],' he said.

'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools.

'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer.'

Jon recently showed support for his fiancee by slamming users on Facebook who took the opportunity to criticise Jodhi for her recent car accident

On the Upside: When some commenters confused Jodhi as Jon's daughter, he replied that his fiancee was flattered by the mistake

Just last week, an account in the name of Jon Stevens didn't take well to some people on social media criticising Johdi for the drink driving incident. 

One user commented: 'Hope she doesn't get p***** & stack her 4wd afterwards.' Stevens hit back, writing: 'Hope you don't choke on your own vomit.' 

He wasn't finished there, the rant posted in the early hours of Thursday continuing: 

'Your poor taste just shows what a pathetic person you must be ... as with everyone makes mistakes and nobody got hurt in Jodhi's accident thank god ... and she completely put her hand up and took full responsibility for her actions which I reckon you don’t know how to do that coz you must be perfect? But I doubt it very much as clearly you are a very boring person that has never made a mistake in your life...' 

The user  replied: 'No I'm not perfect Jon but I have lost a family member through the actions of a drink driver.' 

Message of support: Jon posted this photo of he and Jodhi to Facebook last week after her brand The Upside featured in the David Jones Autumn/Winter fashion parade

Stevens was due to play several gigs this week but the shows have now been cancelled with concert-goers offered refunds

After crashing her car in June and recording a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit, the star was fined $1,100 and banned from driving for a year
