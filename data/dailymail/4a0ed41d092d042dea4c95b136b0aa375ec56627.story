David Gibson, 28,  fractured his skull, nose and both eye sockets after he fell face first into a barrier at the side of the pitch after a horror tackle

A footballer fractured his skull, nose and both eye sockets after he fell face first into a barrier at the side of a pitch during a horror tackle.

David Gibson, 28, was playing for Felixstowe Harpers against Ipswich Valley Rangers in the Bob Coleman Cup quarter final when he careered off the pitch on Saturday.

He was left completely unrecognisable following the incident, and was kept in hospital for two days as medics tended to his horrific injuries at Colchester General Hospital, Essex. 

The match  was immediately abandoned when the forward was injured in the 24th minute while his helpless team-mates looked on. 

Former Ipswich Town right-back Kevin Steggles, the father of David's girlfriend, was at the match.

Mr Steggles, 53,  said: 'It's the worst thing I have ever seen.

'But at the end of the day it was an accident and it's obviously a difficult time for all the family.'

Mr Gibson, of Ipswich, is in his second season at Felixstowe Harpers.

Harpers manager Ian Watson branded the horrifying incident 'traumatic' but said the barrier surrounding the football pitch did conform to FA guidelines.

Mr Watson said: 'It was traumatic.

'David stumbled into it at quite a pace although it was a normal challenge.'

But he stressed: 'If you can have a freak accident like this one just how dangerous are those posts?'

Ipswich Borough Council, which runs Gainsborough Sports Centre, has launched an urgent investigation.

A council spokesman said: 'We have completed a report into the incident and it will now be investigated.

'We are just very pleased that Mr Gibson appears to be making a good recovery - and we send him and his family all the best.'

Mr Watson added: 'The people who dealt with it at the scene were absolutely fantastic, including the managers and physios.

'The reaction from other clubs and players has been really overwhelming - that's the good thing about local football.'

The game will be replayed on Saturday, March 28.
