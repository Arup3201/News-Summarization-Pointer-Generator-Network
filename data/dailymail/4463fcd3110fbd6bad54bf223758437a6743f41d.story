After rubbing shoulders at 18 with the heir to the throne and an actor now tipped for an Oscar, these Eton chums might have been afraid they would be outmatched at any school reunion.

But pity them not, for after having the best start in life nearly half gone on to lucrative careers in the City - earning certainly more than enough to ensure their children can benefit from similar privileges.

Of the 18 members of the year 2000 Eton Society not taking Hollywood by storm or waiting to be crowned king, eight have leveraged their early experiences of having lots money to get into jobs looking after other people's wealth. 

Scroll down for video 

The Eton Society: Edward King (1), James Parry (2), Ivo Stourton (3), Alexander True (4), Ed Millais (5), David Ferreira (6), Tristan Rodgers (7), Matt Lowe (8), Harry Walsh (9), Alastair Balfour (10), Eddie Redmayne (11), Jamie Wrightson (12), Tomas Stael von Holstein (13), Dave Walston (14), Harry Aubrey-Fletcher (15), Tom Roberts (16), Vachan Kashyap (17), Hamish Barne (18), Tony Selwyn (19), Prince William (20)

And from what can be gleaned about them online, the rest have also enjoyed their fair share of success in their chosen fields, from the academia to law to classical music.

Prince William is second in line to the throne, while Eddie Redmayne, fresh from his Golden Globe win, is fast earning himself a place among Hollywood royalty.

But they are not the only high profile alumni of Eton's class of 2000, with Matt Lowe - a music scholarship student and the Eton Society president - now regularly playing cello with some of the biggest names in classical music.

The eight who have gone into finance are Alexander True, David Ferreira, Tristan Rodgers, Harry Walsh, Alastair Balfour, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Tom Roberts and Vachan Kashyap.

Two more are lawyers (including one who combines that profession with a sideline in writing novels), one has recently left the army, one is a Cambridge academic, one works in shipping, one in engineering and another as an entrepreneur in the holistic wellness industry.

Just one has totally renounced the path of corporate progression. Ed Millais abandoned a career as a barrister to become an apprentice in the Church of England and is now working in the inner city (but hardly gritty) parish of Kensington.

As well as helping out with parents' evenings and school tours, members of the group upheld a centuries old tradition of the society - to wear their own individually designed waistcoat. 

Prince William can be seen in the photo, taken in 2000, in a waistcoat made from an Aston Villa shirt while Redmayne, recently named GQ Magazine's Best Dressed Man, is seen in a pink and black number.

Eddie Redmayne won a Best Actor Golden Globe for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the Theory of Everything at the awards last night

The actor previously told how he played rugby with Prince William at school, and described him as a 'wonderful man' who he reportedly felt sorry for, because everyone wanted to tackle the future King of England. 

While Prince William went on to study geography at St Andrews, Redmayne went to Cambridge to read History of Art - the same course as the Duchess of Cambridge. 

Eddie Redmayne took home a Golden Globe last night for best actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. 

Redmayne, who shot to fame when he appeared in Birdsong, beat off competition from Steve Carell in Foxcatcher, Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler, Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game and David Oyelowo in Selma.

The English actor, who was previously the face of Burberry, stars as real-life theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, in the James Marsh directed film.

Eddie Redmayne picked up a best actor Golden Globe award last night 

Eddie Redmayne was born and raised in London. 

He went to Eton College and was in the same year as Prince William. 

Redmayne went on to study History of Art at Trinty College at Cambridge. 

His first stage performance was in a West End production of Oliver! and in 2002 he appeared as Viola in Twelfth Night at Shakespeare's Globe. His appearance earned him many accolades, including being named the most outstanding newcomer by the Evening Standard in 2004. 

Redmayne has had a successful stage career,  appearing in Red at the Donmar Warehouse in London in 2009 which earned him an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. 

The play transferred to Broadway in 2010 and Redmayne went on to win a Tony Award for his performance. 

In film he is known for his roles in The Other Boleyn Girl, My Week with Marilyn and Savage Grace. 

He has also appeared in a number of television productions including Birdsong, Tess of the d'Urbevilles and The Pillars of the Earth. 

Redmayne's talents have also extended to modelling and he modelled for Burberry in 2008, appearing with Cara Delevingne in 2012. 

The actor's appearance also led him to be named on the International Best Dressed List in the September 2012 edition of Vanity Fair. 

He was also recently named best dressed man by GQ magazine in recognition of his dapper outfits.

He has also received a SAG Award nomination and his name is a favourite to be mentioned later this week when Oscar nominations are announced.

The actor married Hannah Bagshawe less than a month ago and was seen on the red carpet, dressed in a velvet suit, with his new wife on Sunday evening. 

They married on December 15 after two years of dating, having become engaged on a romantic holiday in June that year.

Bookmaker Coral has slashed the odds on Eddie Redmayne winning the Oscar for Best Actor next month, after his Golden Globe win. The British star is now the 11-10 second favourite to triumph, with his biggest rival being Michael Keaton who is edging ahead as the 4-5 favourite. 

In the category for Best Picture, Boyhood is now the clear odds-on favourite at 1-7 to be awarded the accolade, ahead of The Imitation Game at 9-1.
