After the news broke her  Facebook page was filled with tributes from other eating disorder sufferers who  she had helped over the years.

Jay's mother Tracey Taylor, 45, also from Walker, Newcastle, has paid tribute to  her 'beautiful' daughter and spoken of how overwhelming the support has  been.

She said: 'The tributes on her Facebook page have been so comforting. She helped so many other people who were suffering from eating disorders, but  in the end she just couldn't help herself.

'She was like a mentor in many ways. She was so bright. She was a really gifted writer and would write poems about  her experiences.

'It was just me and Jade when she died. I'm pleased I was there to comfort her. I don't think there is any bond like the one between a mother and a daughter.

'She had been ill for a long time, since her early teens. We're putting the funeral back until her sister Sherrie gets back from Florida. They were very close.'

Â Eating disorders are characterised by an abnormal attitude towards food that causes someone to change their eating habits and behaviour, according to the NHS.

A person with an eating disorder may focus excessively on their weight and shape, leading them to make unhealthy choices about food with damaging results to their health.

Types of eating disorders:Eating disorders include a range of conditions that can affect someone physically, psychologically and socially. The most common eating disorders are: Anorexia nervosa, when someone tries to keep their weight as low as possible, for example by starving themselves or exercising excessively

Bulimia, when someone tries to control their weight by binge eating and then deliberately being sick or using laxatives (medication to help empty their bowels)

Binge eating, when someone feels compelled to overeatCauses of eating disordersEating disorders are often blamed on the social pressure to be thin, as young people in particular feel they should look a certain way. However, the causes are usually more complex.

There may be some biological or influencing factors, combined with an experience that may provoke the disorder, plus other factors that encourage the condition to continue.

Risk factors that can make someone more likely to have an eating disorder include:

If you or someone you love is suffering from an eating disorder, speak to your GP and visit support websites such as b-eat, eating-disorders, or the National Eating Disorder Association.
