President Vladimir Putin used the 200th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles of the Napoleonic Wars to call for unity and patriotism, as thousands of actors recreated the 
Battle of Borodino.

Mr Putin's government spent at least £700,000 on the re-enactment  which was seen by many as not only a nod to Russian history, but also a show of its current commitment to military power.

The 1812 Battle of Borodino was a key moment in the French-Russian war, which claimed 70,000 lives.

Re-enactment: President Vladimir Putin has joined thousands of enthusiasts as he led commemorations of a battle 200 years ago that led to the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte

Dressed up: Historical club members dressed as soldiers take part in a reenactment marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino at Borodino village some 120 km outside Moscow

Show: It was seen by many as not only a nod to Russian history, but also show of its current commitment to military power

In 1880, Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was commissioned to produce the 1812 Overture to commemorate Russia's defence against Napoleon.

The orchestral masterpiece is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire, ringing chimes, and brass fanfare finale.

As he led the commemorations this week, Putin made a rousing call for unity among Russia’s diverse
ethnic and religious groups.

Standing
by a monument at the scene of the battle, 120 km (75 
miles) west of Moscow, Putin delivered a speech extolling the virtues of
patriotism that enabled Russia to repel the French army.

Back
as president since May, Putin faces more open opposition in big cities 
than at any time since he first rose to power in 2000, and a persistent 
Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus.

Battling: The large and bloody single-day Battle of Borodino between the Imperial Russian Army and Napoleon's Great Army resulted in the retreat of the Russian army and the occupation of Moscow by Napoleon

Result: During the battle neither side won a decisive victory in the battle and tens of thousands of soldiers were killed on both sides before the Russians withdrew and abandoned Moscow to the French

For the second time in recent days he
called for unity, underlining his concern that the insurgency could 
spread and threaten the integrity of Russia, home to many nationalities 
and religions.

'Only 
when Russia’s nations were united, were together, they achieved the best
results in the development of their fatherland,' Putin told Russian and
foreign dignitaries, including former French president Valery Giscard 
d’Estaing.

'By and large patriotism, which was the basis of all our major victories, comes down to the unity of the Russian nation.'

Putin also evoked the Battle of Borodino to rally Russians behind him in his successful presidential election bid last winter.

Occasion:Putin, speaking after laying a wreath at the monument close to the field where actors re-enacted the battle, also used the anniversary to call for unity between European nations

Popular: Tens of thousands of Russians and foreigners gathered at the scene of the battle on Sunday to watch the colourful re-enactment by more than 3,000 military enthusiasts

The Islamic insurgency in the North 
Caucasus, more than a decade after Putin toppled a separatist government
in Chechnya, could also undermine unity in other parts of Russia.

The
killing of a Muslim cleric in July in the central province of 
Tatarstan, in Russia’s heartland, showed violence may be spreading to 
other mainly Muslim regions.

The
Battle of Borodino, remembered by Russians as an epic 
victory, is commemorated in Lev Tolstoy’s novel 'War and Peace'.

Neither
side won a decisive victory in the battle and tens of thousands of 
soldiers were killed on both sides before the Russians withdrew and 
abandoned Moscow to the French.

The
Russian troops regrouped and the French, after occupying Moscow, were 
forced by badly stretched supply lines, the cold winter and lack of 
reinforcements, to withdraw from Russia, constantly harassed by Russian 
forces.

Putin, speaking
after laying a wreath at the monument close to the field where actors 
re-enacted the battle, also used the anniversary to call for unity 
between European nations.

'Such
occasions as today do not only serve to remember bloody events. This is
a good reason to speak about how we should build relations with our 
neighbours, our current friends in the common European home,' he said.

Big spenders: It was reported that Mr Putin's government spent at least £700,000 on the re-enactment

Acting the part: Nine planes were used to disperse clouds over the scene, but rain soon covered the field, along with grey smoke steaming from historic weaponry

'I’m deeply convinced that real reconciliation and respect for the past, for our common history, for the heroism of our predecessors, for the honour and bravery of the soldiers carrying out their war duty, is the foundation for really friendly relations between countries and nations,' he said.

Russians also take pride in their country’s effort to defeat Nazi Germany in World War Two, which began on Sept. 1, 1939, at the cost of millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians.

'We were more often together than at war. France was always our strategic ally,' Putin told Giscard d’Estaing.

'I hope we will manage with our friends from France and other European countries to do more to unite Europe on the basis of moral values.'

Tens of thousands of Russians and foreigners gathered at the scene of the battle on Sunday to watch the colourful re-enactment by more than 3,000 military enthusiasts.

Nine planes were used to disperse clouds over the scene, but rain soon covered the field, along with grey smoke steaming from historic weaponry.

'The level of patriotism in our country has sunk in the last 25 years. Such events help to bring it back,' said Alexei Rogatnev from St Petersburg, dressed as a 19th century Russian soldier.
