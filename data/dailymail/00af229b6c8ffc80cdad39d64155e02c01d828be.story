Nobody ever laughed at Luis Suarez. Racist abuse isn’t funny. Biting an opponent isn’t funny. Diving and cheating isn’t terribly amusing either.

So quite what Suarez meant when he suggested ‘people in England laughed’ about his ‘attitude over the last few years’ is anybody’s guess.

All that can be said is that the Uruguay striker was utterly humourless when he spoke to the assembled English media in a corner of the post-match interview area here on Thursday.

Payback time: Suarez felt no remorse about sinking his adopted home

He was cold, impassive. Nothing like the man we had just seen kiss his physiotherapist on the head before blubbing in the dug-out. No, after a shower and an encounter with doping control this was now payback time. This was a chance to settle a score by delivering a not-so-polite ‘up yours’ to his adopted home.

Which was a pity given how prepared we English were to acknowledge his brilliance. To acknowledge the sheer force of will he displayed in almost singlehandedly destroying England’s hapless defence.

We knew he was a world-class talent. It was why he was crowned the best player in the country by both his peers and the Press.

But to perform at that level on Thursday only weeks after he was being pushed around in a wheelchair was incredible.

It was an achievement that commanded our respect. Sadly that respect does not seem to go both ways and this is not about the English media — which is irrelevant — but about his colleagues at Anfield, the people of Liverpool and beyond.

The people who were prepared to forgive and forget and recognise that here was someone who addressed his issues and became a better player, and a better man, as a result.

Now, however, you have to question just how genuine he was. In fact, you start to question a number of things he has said in recent months and wonder whether the real Suarez has just resurfaced again.

The same Suarez we saw agitating for a move away from Liverpool last year. Who even resorted to questioning the honesty and integrity of his manager, Brendan Rodgers. 

Only last month he said he was committed to remaining with Liverpool. That he signed his new contract last December because he was now totally committed to the Anfield cause.

My best manager

Sven Goran Eriksson. Far from perfect but made three consecutive quarter-finals and masterminded big wins against top opposition.

My favourite momentThe 5-1 win in Germany is the most exciting match I’ve witnessed covering England.

My favourite player

Rio Ferdinand. There have been more gifted players, but he was a top class centre half — something we’re missing.

‘I signed the contract because I love it here,’ he said. ‘If you’re not happy here you don’t sign any contract.’

Before Liverpool’s players went their separate ways for the summer he also told them he was going nowhere. Steven Gerrard was certainly of the view that Suarez would give Liverpool at least one more season.

More worrying for Liverpool is the apparent disregard for the reception he is sure to receive in the Premier League after making his remarks. The suspicion must be that he does not fear the inevitable hostility because he does not intend to return to England.

On Friday the Spanish newspapers were dominated by speculation regarding Suarez. The hierarchy at Real Madrid were thought to have been encouraged by Suarez’s post-match comments, sensing there might now be a chance to pounce. 

Defying the odds: Suarez had surgery on a knee injury just a month ago

In Barcelona it is claimed that a deal is all but done. Whether the Catalans have the financial clout to make such a move remains to be seen.

But Mundo Deportivo, the Barcelona sports daily, reported that the club had not only identified Suarez as their top target but said talks are very serious.

They wrote of an €85million release clause in Suarez’s contract that would be lowered by €20 million should Real Madrid or Barcelona make a bid.

And they salivated over the prospect of Suarez partnering Lionel Messi and Neymar in the most formidable attack in Europe. At the same time, they said Alexis Sanchez might move to Liverpool.

The report also highlighted the added attraction for Suarez of having the in-laws round the corner.

Apparently his wife’s family live in Castelldefels, a Barcelona suburb where the likes of Messi currently reside.

‘I want to see what they think now,’ was how Suarez signed off his message to those he considers his detractors. Presumably from a safer vantage point, somewhere in Spain.
