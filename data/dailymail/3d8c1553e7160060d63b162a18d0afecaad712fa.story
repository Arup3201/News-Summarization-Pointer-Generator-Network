With all of its homes and businesses without power, it is one of the areas hardest hit by Storm Juno.

But in the midst of the blizzard, the small Massachusetts island of Nantucket has welcomed a new life.

At around 3.53am on Tuesday, baby Cayden Keith Moore was born at Nantucket Cottage Hospital.

He was delivered with the help of a backup generator after the snowstorm swept across the small community, destroying power lines, sparking wind gusts of 78mph and causing widespread floods.

Speaking to the Boston Herald, Cayden's mother, Danielle Smith, 22, admitted she had been a 'little worried' about giving birth to her son while the hospital was running on generator power.

'I got to the hospital before it got super bad outside and by the time we did deliver we were running on generators,' said Miss Smith, joined at the hospital by Cayden's father, Corrigan Moore, 19.

'We were actually a week-and-a-half early, but we were both really excited... Before I went into active labor everyone was saying he would be the first blizzard baby of 2015, which I think is pretty cool.'

Cayden, who weighs 6lbs 4.8oz and is healthy, was delivered by Dr. Margaret Koehm.

'They told me to go home, pack your bags and do the little things you need to take care of before the storm hits,' the new mother said. 'We were able to get to the hospital in the morning.

'It was still just the fluffy snow that wasn’t sticking yet. They told us it was probably a safer bet to just get our things together and come back in case we needed to be here when the snow got really bad.'

The hospital also reached out to another expectant mother on Tuesday. She also agreed to shelter at the facility until the storm ceases, according to MyFoxBoston.com.

Nantucket is continuing to battle the effects of Juno, which is tearing across America's East Coast. Eleven people so far have been evacuated from flooded areas of the island to a shelter.

On Tuesday morning, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) reported that the community was 100 per cent without power. It is also suffering from no cell phone coverage.

And Nantucket is not Massachusett's only region to have been greatly disrupted by Juno.

A huge 33.1 inches of snow in the town of Lunenburg, with wind gusts topping 75mph. Meanwhile, in Boston, Juno dumped 26 inches of the white stuff on many streets, with 30mph overnight winds.

And in Marshfield, an 80 to 100 foot section of a sea wall collapsed due to the bad weather, causing floodwater to surge into nearby streets and homes.  

'I have damage to the front of my house. The shingles are off. You know, because this is about the tenth time I've done this, I probably have about $25,000 in damage,' one resident told WHDH. 

Another added: 'Scary. Scary night. Heard the water come running down here.'
