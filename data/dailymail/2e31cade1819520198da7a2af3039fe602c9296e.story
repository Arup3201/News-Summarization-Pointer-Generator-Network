The number of children adopted from state care has risen by almost 60 per cent in four years to more than 5,000 – the highest level since modern records began.

It is a triumph for former Education Secretary Michael Gove’s new rules sweeping away barriers blocking adoption on racial or bureaucratic grounds.

Figures released yesterday showed 5,050 children were adopted in the year to the end of March, an increase of 26 per cent in a year and 58 per cent since 2010. 

The number of children adopted under four years old has gone up by 70 per cent since 2010.

There are now more adoptions than at any time since comparable records began in 1992.

The breakthrough follows years of decline in adoption as social workers insisted children in state care should only go to families of the same racial or cultural background. 

Adoptions were also blocked on the grounds that prospective parents were too old, or that they smoked, or even that they were too middle class.

Critics said children were being damaged by being forced to live in care homes or with a succession of foster families because social workers had an ideological dislike of adoption.

After the appointment in 2010 of Mr Gove – who was brought up by adoptive parents – guidance was changed to speed up adoption and remove barriers such as race, age or class. 

Adoption falls under children’s services covered by the Department for Education.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who replaced Mr Gove in July, said the rise in adoptions – which had fallen to 3,100 in 2011 – meant thousands more vulnerable children were finding homes.

She said: 'These figures show a significant and sustained rise in the number of adoptions – an increase of 26 per cent in the last twelve months. 

'This means thousands more of our most vulnerable of children finding the loving and permanent homes they so desperately need.

‘We also promised to remove delay and frustration from the process for both children and adopters. Today’s figures show that we are delivering on that promise.

'The system is working more quickly, as well as providing more support to families after an adoption has taken place.’

On average a child entering the care system who is adopted waited two years of four months before becoming legally part of their new family. However, the waiting time has gone down by two months over the past year.

The difficulties for children brought up in state care who do not win adoption can be highly damaging.

In 2012 figures showed that a third of children living long-term in state care failed to learn to read by the time they were seven. 

Seven out of eight failed to reach the benchmark for a decent education, five A*-C passes at GCSE or equivalent including English and maths.

One in five were not up to date with immunisations, and almost the same proportion had not been to a dentist in a year.

Yesterday’s figures showed that among 27,220 young people who spent their childhood in the care system and are now aged 19,20, and 21, nearly four out of 10 are NEETs – not in education, employment or training. 

Figures also showed the number of children in care rose to 68,840 last year, up by seven per cent on 2010 levels.
