Fears for the health of Ukraine's jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko are growing after it was confirmed that she has been taken to hospital.

Less than a week after images emerged apparently showing bruises inflicted on the former Prime Minister, a high-security police convoy was seen taking her for treatment.

Tymoshenko's daughter, Yevgenia, has also said that the 51-year-old has agreed to end her hunger strike which started on April 20.

Her imprisonment has soured relations 
between Ukraine and the West with Prince William among those boycotting 
the country over the abuse claims.

Her transfer from prison in the 
eastern city of Kharkiv to a nearby hospital for treatment under the 
supervision of German doctors was worked out last week in a compromise.

But Wednesday's early morning transfer
seemed unlikely to relieve pressure on Yanukovich who has been thrown 
on the back-foot by sharp Western criticism of his treatment of his 
rival. 

Deputy Health Minister Raisa Moiseyenko said Tymoshenko was moved from her prison in Kharkiv to a local clinic Wednesday morning.

Dr Lutz Harms, a neurologist with Berlin's Charite clinic, will supervise her treatment at the hospital because Tymoshenko does not trust government-controlled doctors.

Moiseyenko said she hopes the hospitalisation and treatment will prompt Tymoshenko to end her hunger strike.

Ukraine's Deputy Health Minister told reporters Tymoshenko was moved to the hospital this morning

Supporters supporters near the jail in Khariv shouted out 'Freedom for Yulia!'

Fears: Yulia Tymoshenko thought she was 'in the last moments of her life' during the 'attack', her daughter said

Tymoshenko was jailed last October for seven years for alleged abuse of 
power while in office, a charge she denied.

She says she is the victim of a 
vendetta by Yanukovich who narrowly beat her for the presidency in 
February 2010. The European Union and the United States have condemned 
her trial and sentencing as politically motivated and called for her to 
be released.

Authorities have denied she was mistreated.

Her daughter, Yevgenia, said on 
Tuesday her mother had agreed to end her hunger strike under the 
supervision of a German doctor in a local hospital.

Eyewitnesses in Kharkiv said 
Tymoshenko was brought to a side entrance of the hospital by ambulance 
on Wednesday morning in a heavily guarded convoy that included several 
police cars.

Two lines of white-coated hospital 
staff shielded her as she was carried into the hospital on a stretcher, 
preventing journalists and onlookers catching a glimpse of her.

A few supporters nearby shouted out 'Freedom for Yulia!'

The state prison service, in a 
statement, confirmed she had been moved to hospital 'for the course of 
rehabilitation recommended by the international medical commission'.

Tymoshenko appeared placid and 
untroubled at World War Two Victory Day celebrations on Wednesday, 
despite the growing political pressure.

Addressing war veterans in Kiev, he 
spoke of the need to defend world peace by shunning 'populism of all 
types', but remained silent about Tymoshenko.

In an embarrassing setback on Tuesday,
he called off an informal summit meeting in Yalta of Central and 
Eastern European leaders after several of them said they were staying 
away because of the Tymoshenko affair.

He quickly drew fire for this from other opposition figures.

Arseny Yatsenyuk, leader of the Front 
of Change party, said cancellation of the Yalta meeting amounted to a 
'shameful failure' for Ukraine.

'This leadership is dragging the 
country and its people with it into international isolation,' Interfax 
news agency quoted Yatsenyuk as saying.

Vitaly Klitschko, world heavyweight 
boxing champion who heads the Udar party, said: 'The leadership clearly 
has no wish to change the situation and meet calls by Kiev's European 
partners to respect human rights and democratic standards.'

Western outrage over the treatment of 
the charismatic Tymoshenko, who led the 2004 Orange Revolution street 
protests which doomed Yanukovich's first bid for the presidency, has led
to threats by European politicians to boycott the European soccer 
championships which Ukraine co-hosts next month.

The prestigious, month-long Euro-2012 
tournament which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland from June 8 to the 
final in Kiev on July 1, is meant to showcase the former Soviet republic
as a modern European nation with its heart set on joining the 
mainstream.

Some individual Western government 
ministers now say they will not attend Euro-2012 matches. European 
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said he has no plans to 
visit Ukraine and the other 26 commissioners are following suit.

An EU diplomat said he expected EU 
foreign ministers to 'harmonise and coordinate' strategy towards Ukraine
at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.

The row over Tymoshenko has already 
led to the indefinite shelving of the signing and ratification of 
landmark political and free trade agreements with the EU.The beating is alleged to have 
occurred on the evening of April 20, while prison guards transferred her
to hospital to be treated for back pain.
