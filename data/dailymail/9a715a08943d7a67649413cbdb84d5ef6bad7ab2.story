John Whelan was banned from driving for six months

A man was arrested in his vintage convertible for driving at five mph after drinking seven bottles of cider. 

John Whelan had been in the pub all day when he got behind the wheel of his £20,000 TVR Chimaera . 

In a bid to go unnoticed, the 25-year-old planned to drive the 200 yard stretch to his work's car park in Brecon, mid Wales, at a snail's pace to avoid police attention.

But when officers pulled the quantity surveyor over, he gave a reading of 109 microgrammes of alcohol - more than three times the legal limit of 35. 

Whelan was banned from driving for six months and fined £660 at Brecon Magistrates Court. He was also told to attend a drink driving rehabilitation course. 

The court heard how Whelan had been watching the football with friends in the pub when he downed seven bottles of Mangners cider. 

He decided to move the car - which can go from zero to 60mph in just five seconds - to his office's car park for the evening. 

A by-passer noticed the bright yellow vehicle crawling up the country road and called police. 

Prosecuting Lisa Jones said: 'He was located by police who’d been contacted, not because he was driving too fast or swerving across the road, but because he was driving too slowly at 5mph.

'He was full compliant at the road side and was arrested following a positive road side breath test.'

The 25-year-old said he now may move to a city with better public transport.

The 25-year-old had been driving his £20,000 TVR Chimaera while more than three times over the legal limit 

Defending Carl Millar said: 'He is a self employed quantity surveyor who relies on his car - his current contract covers a 100 mile area.

'Whelan’s future is somewhat unknown, he may move to London as the public transport system is better there or he may return home to Ireland.'
