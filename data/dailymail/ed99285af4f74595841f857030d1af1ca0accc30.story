An elderly couple found buried in the back garden of their home were both shot, police have said.

The remains are believed to be William and Patricia Wycherley who have not been seen since 1998.

The bodies were found in the garden of a house in Forest Town, Mansfield, on October 9,

It has been reported the couple's daughter Susan Edwards, 55, and her 
husband Christopher, 57, were arrested on suspicion of murder at St Pancras International 
railway station in London on Wednesday.

Police have said an elderly couple found in this garden in Forest Town, Mansfield, were both shot

Macabre find: Nottinghamshire Police are 
still waiting for forensic tests to confirm the remains are those of the
Wycherleys, but detectives are 'confident' the skeletons discovered in 
the back garden belong to the pair

They continue to be questioned by 
detectives in relation to the deaths as police revealed the cause of 
death had now been determined.

Mr and Mrs Wycherley disappeared from the house in 1998, according to neighbours.

A spokeswoman for Nottinghamshire Police said: ‘Following an examination of the remains, discovered in the back garden of a house in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, on Wednesday 9 October 2013, a Home Office pathologist has determined that both people died as a result of being shot.’

Murder inquiry: The outside of the semi-detached house in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where police three weeks ago found the remains of William and Patricia Wycherley buried in the back garden after a tip-off

Mr and Mrs Wycherley moved into the house in 1987.

A murder inquiry was launched after the bodies were unearthed in the back garden of the semi-detached house following a tip-off to the police.

Neighbours said Mr Wycherley, a former merchant sailor who would now be 100, and his wife, who would now be 79, ‘disappeared’ from the property in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in the late 1990s.

Rumours later circulated locally and within their extended family that the couple had moved to either Ireland or to the Lancashire coast.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
