Two Planned Parenthood nurses quit their jobs because of dirty and dangerous work conditions and what they called 'a meat-market style of assembly-line abortions'.

The former employees of the Delaware branch have spoken out about what allegedly takes place behind its closed doors and said that a rush to get patients in and out leaves the operating tables soiled and unclean and that doctors don't wear gloves.

Jayne Mitchell-Werbrich, former employee said: 'It was just unsafe. I couldn't tell you how ridiculously unsafe it was.

'It's not washed down, it's not even cleaned off. It has bloody drainage on it.'

Under the spotlight: The former employees of the Delaware branch have spoken out about what takes place behind its closed doors and says it needs to be stopped

Another former employee, Joyce Vasikonis told Action News: 'They were using instruments on patients that were not sterile. They could be at risk of getting hepatitis, even AIDS.'

Both nurses quit their jobs to protect their medical licenses and because they did not want to be held liable if a patient was harmed.

A series of emergency calls were made from the clinic this year which raised concerns about practices taking place there.

Since January 4, five patients 
allegedly have been rushed from the facility to the emergency room, 
again placing the clinic in the spotlight.

But in Delaware, abortion clinics are not 
subject to routine inspections and the state only steps in when they have a
patient complaint.

Investigators say they have not found evidence to support the claims raised by Vasikonis and Werbrich.

This year, one doctor and two more nurses have left. Several patients have lawsuits pending against the clinic.

The branch CEO Ruth Lytle-Barnaby told Action News: 'Planned Parenthood of Delaware has 
provided high-quality services for more than 80 years. Each year, we 
provide confidential, compassionate care that includes breast cancer 
screenings, birth control, prevention and treatment of STDs, Pap tests, 
sexual health education, abortion, and health counseling to more than 
11,000 women, men and teens in all three Delaware counties.

'In my role as the new CEO of Planned 
Parenthood of Delaware, recently my staff and I launched a review of 
patient services. I determined that we need to take immediate steps to 
assure our patients of our high-quality care, including enacting 
immediate personnel changes.

'We do not tolerate employees that fail to 
meet our standards for patient care and services. Any 
employee who does not live up to our standards of patient care will be 
terminated. Patient health and safety has always been and remains 
our top priority.'
