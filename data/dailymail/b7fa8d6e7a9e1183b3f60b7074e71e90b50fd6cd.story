Long-forgotten headshots of Hollywood stars before they were famous appear in a new book titled 8x10.

Andie MacDowell is seen around the time she was transitioning from a model to actress aged 25, while a bright-eyed Naomi Watts, 18, gazes into the camera shortly after making her movie debut.

The images were captured by New York-based photographer Andrew Brucker, who explains that he came into contact with 'so many cool people, all so young, with that wild spark.'

One of his youngest clients was Winona Ryder. She visited his studio alone when she was just 14 after scoring her first major part in the 1986 film Lucas. She went on to star in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice.

Kate Bosworth, now aged 30, also turned to Mr Brucker as her career began to take off, thanks to her appearance in Robert Redford's 1998 hit, The Horse Whisperer.

Meanwhile a 19-year-old Kerry Washington got her portrait taken while starring in a less glamorous educational series on the PBS channel called Standard Deviants.

Among the leading men to appear in Mr Brucker's book are Chris Noth, Robert Downey Jr. and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

A fresh-faced and stubble-free Alec Baldwin also appears on the cover of the hardback.

Mr Brucker told MailOnline that Mr Baldwin was one of his favorite subjects.

'Alec Baldwin
lacked a certain vanity that photographers love. His enthusiasm made it a truly creative process'

'His enthusiasm made it a truly creative and collaborative process,' he recalled.

'He was always game to try things and
lacked a certain vanity that photographers love. We worked together 
after those early shots many more times.'

Mr Brucker started out in fashion but during the late Eighties decided to explore the world of headshot photography.

It didn’t take long before he
became the go-to man for every serious young actor in New York. While 
some went on to make it big, he said the majority suffered from 'loss of
focus, substance abuse, and just giving up.'

Looking to the dramatic, stylized portraits from 1930s Hollywood he chose to shoot all of his clients in black-and-white.

He says that he preferred using natural light and 'intimacy was important'. Each actor was told to bring their own set of clothes that were 'true to their personalities' and girls had to do their own make-up.

‘Many of my customers became friends and some still are to this day,' he revealed, adding that the bigger stars moved on 'keeping up with the pace and demands of their success.'

8x10 by Andrew Brucker is published by FVW and can be purchased for $39 from Strand Books
