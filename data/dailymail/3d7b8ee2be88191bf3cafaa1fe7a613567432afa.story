Pictured wearing his Red Arrows display uniform with pride, this is one of the last photographs taken of tragic pilot Jon Egging just a day before he died.

The RAF pilot was taking part in a meet-and-greet with fans of the display team and is seen smiling as he is joined by enthusiast Samantha Barnes at a static display at the Bournemouth Air Festival.

The photograph emerged after it was claimed Flight Lieutenant Egging may have crashed when a bird hit his jet after Saturday's display over Bournemouth, Dorset. The famous squadron has now been grounded 'for weeks' according to an RAF source as the investigation into the crash continues.

Investigators have discovered remains
at the crash site which suggest a ‘catastrophic bird strike’, a senior 
RAF source said yesterday.

This could have extinguished the flame in the Hawk T1 jet’s engine – known as a flame out – resulting in a total loss of power.

The possible theory behind the tragic crash emerged as Flight Lieutenant Egging’s family suggested he crashed after being knocked unconscious during the jet’s final seconds.

A post-mortem examination of his body today revealed he died of multiple injuries.

The 33-year-old is said to have steered the Hawk away from houses before it crashed into the bank of a river as his wife watched on in horror.

The Red Arrows had just completed a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival when the single-engine jet went out of control as they returned to the seaside town’s airport on Saturday afternoon.

Witnesses yesterday told how they found the body of the pilot, known as ‘Eggman’, face down in the River Stour.

His ejector seat and helmet were nearby, while his parachute was also in the water.

Flight Lieutenant Egging’s grandmother said relatives have been told 
the pilot may have been unable to eject from the stricken jet because of
the huge G-forces  encountered when he banked at too sharp an angle.

The pilot managed to set the Hawk on a 
path away from homes in the nearby village of Throop, and issued a 
Mayday call and is thought to have been thrown from the wreckage on 
impact.

Doris Egging, 88, 
from Southam, Warwickshire, said: ‘Jon was a hero but he probably didn’t
eject because he was unable to after being knocked out.

‘I spoke to my son, Jon’s father Philip, and he sounded ill. He couldn’t take it in.

‘I’m
told they were coming back at quite a height and this may have sent 
Jon’s plane out of control. Philip was told Jon was higher than he 
should have been when he banked.

‘I would very much believe he would sacrifice his own life to save others, that’s the way he was.’

Flight
Lieutenant Egging, who grew up in the nearby village of Ufton, joined 
Southam’s Air Training Corps at 13. He was awarded a Royal Air Force 
bursary while at Southampton University, and joined in 2000.

In
2009 he completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan, flying a Harrier GR9 
in support of ground forces. All Red Arrows pilots must complete at 
least one tour in order to join the elite display team.

Mrs Egging added: ‘He survived some 
hairy moments out there, by all accounts. It’s a terrible irony that he 
survived that, only to lose his life now.

‘But flying with the Red Arrows was his dream. He was so proud, as we all were of him.’

The
pilot and his wife, Dr Emma Egging, 32, an academic at the British 
Museum, married last June in their local village church in Morcott, 
Rutland.

Hours after Saturday’s crash, the widow issued a moving tribute to the ‘exemplary pilot’, and said: ‘Watching him today, I was the proudest I’ve ever been. I loved everything about him’.

He was inspired to fly by his father, Philip, 59, a retired BA pilot. Both his father, who lives with second wife Linda, 53, in Alcester, Warwickshire, and mother, Dawn, a university administrator, 59 today, who still lives in Ufton, have travelled to Bournemouth.

Nick Woods, 35, who discovered Flight Lieutenant Egging’s body in the water, said: ‘I could tell straight away it was too late. He was very badly injured, dead. There was nothing I could do.’

Mr Woods described hearing a spluttering noise from the plane seconds before it hit the ground.

Yesterday, a senior RAF source said that investigators revealed they had found bird remains at the crash site.

Earlier this month, a bird strike forced a Red Arrow jet to make an emergency landing at the Blackpool Air show, while in 1997, a Red Arrows jet made an emergency landing after flying into a flock of birds during training.

Hero in the making: Jon aged six

The Red Arrows have used the dual 
control BAE Systems Hawk T1 aircraft since 1979. There are 170 of the 
training aircraft in service with the RAF and all have been grounded.

Formed
in 1965, the Red Arrows have completed more than 4,000 displays. Though
there have been other crashes, the last deaths occurred in 1978 when 
two pilots were killed during a practice session.

Around
30 apply to join each year, whittled down to a shortlist of nine who 
must then pass flying tests.  Of those that pass, the current pilots 
select three to join the team, based on their personal qualities, in a 
closed selection meeting.

There
are no reserve pilots as one pilot could not learn all nine positions 
to the standard required. If members are unavailable, the team perform 
in a smaller formation.

Yesterday
a minute’s silence was held for Flight Lieutenant Egging and a tribute 
film shown at the Bournemouth Air Festival before yesterday’s air 
displays began.

A spokesman 
at the Red Arrows’ base at Scampton, Lincolnshire, refused to speculate 
on the cause of the crash, which is being looked into by a MoD-led 
Service Inquiry.
