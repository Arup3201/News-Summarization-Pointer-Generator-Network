Was this the finest season in the history of European golf? When you think of names like Ballesteros, Faldo, Woosnam, Lyle and Langer, it would be quite a statement. Not to mention recent examples, such as 2012 when Rory was winning the US PGA and we had the miracle of Medinah.

But, by way of a farewell column for this marvellous year, let’s make the case. In the spirit of Christmas, let’s recall 12 days that add to a wondrous argument for thinking it just so.

Day One: Players Championship, Sawgrass

It was all a bit quiet until mid-May. Thankfully, German Martin Kaymer thought it too quiet. With a gutsy 30ft putt for par on the island-green 17th he secured a one-stroke win in the PGA Tour’s flagship event and ignited a stunning run of success.

Day Two: BMW PGA Championship, Wentworth

The week began with Rory McIlroy revealing his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki. Gee, we thought: what next? Thankfully, the answer was Rory The Golfer Like No Other. Seven shots back with a round left, McIlroy made up the deficit with a 66 for his first win on European soil.

Day Three: US Open, Pinehurst

The best 72-hole performance in 2014? There’s no argument. It’s that man Kaymer. After two rounds, he was the first man in major history to follow one 65 with another. He was eight clear. No one got near him over the weekend, either.

Day Four: French Open, Paris National

If you had to compile a list of players you would least like chasing you down the stretch, Graeme McDowell would be near the top. Kevin Stadler must have thought eight shots was enough insurance but G-Mac chased him down to complete a thrilling title defence.

Day Five: Scottish Open, Royal Aberdeen

He had already won once in July, in America. Now Justin Rose crossed the Atlantic and delivered a links masterclass. Four rounds in the sixties and a total of 16 under par on a course as forbidding as this one was a majestic effort.

Day Six: Open Championship, Royal Liverpool

So much for McIlroy not being able to play links golf. Like all the greats, he went away and worked hard on what was missing. His reward was two 66s to begin, a couple of eagles at the tail end of his next round, and a two-shot win on the final day. He became the first European to win three of the four majors.

Day Seven: Bridgestone Invitational, Firestone

Who would have blamed him if he had rested on his laurels after his Open win? McIlroy, however, was a man on a mission. Next stop, one of his favourite courses, as he caught Sergio Garcia to claim his first World Golf Championship event. He was world No 1 once more.

Day Eight: USPGA Championship, Valhalla

Over the previous eight rounds we had seen the power and glory of Rory; now we saw the guts. After a long weather suspension he was three behind Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson and two off Phil Mickelson with nine to go. Yet he passed them all in the dying Kentucky light to seal his second Major in a row.

Day Nine: Ryder Cup Friday, Gleneagles

It’s never easy being heavy favourites, nor shifting momentum after losing the opening series. But Europe’s golfers overcame both to turn a one-point deficit at lunch into a two-point advantage. The Americans had targeted McIlroy and Ian Poulter, only for Rose and Stenson to demonstrate this was a team of many talents.

Day 10: Ryder Cup Saturday

The Americans came back strong on the second morning, only to run into Lee Westwood and McDowell at their most obdurate. Alongside brilliant rookie partners Jamie Donaldson and Victor Dubuisson, they ensured there would be no US comeback. Europe led by four.

Day 11: Ryder Cup Sunday

A good start by the Americans and suddenly there were some frayed nerves. But G-Mac settled those by fighting back from three down against Jordan Spieth to win the opening singles. With Rory thrashing Fowler, it was Donaldson who clinched the winning point with a wedge shot of a lifetime to 12 inches.

Day 12: DP World Tour Championship, Dubai

It was fitting the final event came down to a shootout between four of Europe’s stars. Appropriate too, that the shot that separated Stenson from McIlroy, Rose and Dubuisson, to the par-three 17th, was one of the best played all year.

Quote of the year

'You could argue that Rory’s run in the summer was the best three-week stretch of golf ever played.'

American Rickie Fowler offers his take on Rory McIlroy’s 12 rounds from mid-July to mid-August that earned him two majors and a WGC. In sequence: 66, 66, 68, 71, 69, 64, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68.

It wasn’t just on the men’s circuit that Europe’s leading players dominated. Thanks to Colin Montgomerie with his two senior majors and a brilliant year for the ageless Bernhard Langer, they cleaned up among the over-50s as well. Meanwhile, at the Dubai Ladies Championship this week, England’s Charley Hull, at the age of just 18, is in pole position to become the youngest winner of the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit.
