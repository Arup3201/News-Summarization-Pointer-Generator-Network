A man was arrested after a teenage girl he allegedly exposed himself to chased him for half an hour until police arrived.

Jodie Schofield, 16, was walking down an alleyway near her home off Blackfriars Road in Salford, Greater Manchester, when she claims a man appeared and exposed himself.

Jodie immediately ran after the man and after a two-mile pursuit her screams eventually alerted two builders who helped detain him on New Hall Road as she called police.

Feisty 16-year-old Jodie Schofield was so annoyed when a middle-aged man allegedly flashed at her that she chased him for thirty minutes until two builders stopped him and the police arrived to arrest him

A 52-year-old man was arrested at the scene and has since been released on bail.

Jodie, who was returning home after walking her cousin to school at St Peter and St John Primary School at the time of the incident, said she gave chase out of anger as the man had been ‘laughing’ throughout the act.

She said: “I saw him peeking around the corner and then he disappeared.

“I shouted at him and told him to stop but he was just laughing at me the whole time and I didn’t want him to get away with it.

“I was running after him for ages – about 30 minutes – but I just didn’t want him to get away. After a while two builders saw us and I was shouting what had happened so they managed to get hold of him and keep him there until the police arrived.”

Jodie didn’t know the builders who came to her aid but said she wanted to thank them again having only had chance to speak to them briefly at the scene.

She said: “I want to say thank you to them for helping me stop him because it’s a horrible thing to go through.”

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman confirmed the incident is being investigated.

He said: “We received a call at 10.36am where an adult male had been detained by members of the public and was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure.

“He was chased by the complainant and detained nearby by builders who had seen him running away.

“He has since been bailed until May 1, pending further enquiries.”
