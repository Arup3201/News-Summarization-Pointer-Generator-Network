Eight Los Angeles police officers 
violated department policy when they mistakenly riddled a pickup truck 
with bullets, injuring two women, during a manhunt last year for 
cop-turned-killer Christopher Dorner, a civilian oversight board 
announced Tuesday.

Police
 Chief Charlie Beck and Alex Bustamante, inspector general for the Los 
Angeles Police Commission, independently recommended that the shooting 
be ruled out of policy, commission President Steve Soboroff said. He did
 not provide further details.

Beck
 will decide disciplinary measures for the officers, who were assigned 
to non-field duties during an LAPD investigation. Possible measures 
could include extensive retraining, suspensions or even firings.

Out of policy: Police Chief Charlie Beck will determine how to best punish the eight officers the panel found to be out of policy

At
 a news conference, Beck said he couldn't comment on what discipline the
 officers may receive because their information is private under state 
law. He said 'these officers will all and have all received extensive 
training as had the whole Los Angeles Police Department relative to 
these types of issues.'

Los
 Angeles Police Protective League spokesman Eric Rose said the union's 
president, Tyler Izen, was waiting to review the commission's report 
before providing comment.

Last
 year, the city paid the women $4.2 million to settle a claim. That was 
in addition to a separate $40,000 settlement for the loss of their 
truck.

The Police Commission's determination didn't surprise the women's attorney, Glen Jonas.

Deal reached: The city of Los Angeles has agreed to pay Margie Carranza (left) and her mother, Emma Hernandez (right), $4.2million after the women were shot in February during a manhunt for Chris Dorner

Mistaken identity: LAPD officers fired at least 100 rounds at the delivery women's Toyota Tacoma without warning after mistaking it for Dorner's pickup

'There
 (are) 4.2 million reasons I have to believe it's out of policy,' he 
said. 'Anyone with any common sense would agree it's out of policy.'

Dorner,
 a fired Los Angeles police officer, claimed he was unfairly dismissed 
and vowed revenge against law enforcement officers in a rambling online 
manifesto.

He killed 
the daughter of a former LAPD police official along with her fiance and 
two law enforcement officers over 10 days before being cornered and 
killing himself in a burning mountain cabin in San Bernardino County.

On
 Feb. 7, 2013, Los Angeles police guarding the Torrance home of a 
high-profile target named in Dorner's manifesto opened fire on a pickup 
truck they thought was Dorner's.

Compromise: Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich, right, stands with Glen Jonas, attorney for the two injured women, during a news conference to announce a city settlement with Margie Carranza and Emma Hernandez

V for victory: Glen Jonas called the settlement amount fair and said it possibly spared the city as much as $15million

It actually contained the two women delivering newspapers.

'This was a tragic cascade of circumstances that led to an inaccurate conclusion by the officers,' the police chief said.

The
 officers had earlier learned that the target's wife recently had seen 
Dorner in the neighborhood appearing to case the location, and just 
prior to the shooting officers heard over police radio that Dorner was 
getting off the freeway nearby, Beck said. In the early morning hours, 
officers said they saw the blue Toyota pickup 'creeping' down the road, 
according to the chief's report, with its high beams and flashers on.

In
 his report to the commission, the chief said he expected that officers 
'make every effort that they determine that the truck was in fact 
Dorner's.'

He wrote, 
'While there were similarities, the truck that approached was a 
different make and model, different color, had no ski racks and no 
over-sized tires.'

Beck
 said officers opened fire immediately after one woman threw a newspaper
 and an officer mistook the sound of it hitting the pavement for 
gunfire.

'There is no 
evidence to support that they were holding an object that could be 
reasonably perceived to be an imminent deadly threat,' Beck wrote in his
 report. He said an officer with similar training and experience would 
not reasonably perceive a deadly threat in the same situation.

'I
 sympathize with the officers, but I have a very high standard for the 
application of deadly force, and the shooting did not meet that 
standard,' he said Tuesday.

The mother and daughter had reached a separate deal for $40,000 to replace their ruined Toyota Tacoma

Officers fired 103 rounds, and up to 40 of the shots hit the walls, windows and garages of nearby homes, Jonas said.

Emma
 Hernandez, who was 71 at the time, was shot in the back, and her 
daughter, Margie Carranza, then 47, suffered minor injuries. Hernandez 
recovered except for some slight shoulder problems but neither woman 
returned to work, Jonas said, adding that Carranza tried but 'it was too
 traumatic for her.'

'The emotional and mental trauma is still there and they're still dealing with that,' he said.

The
 shooting occurred hours after Dorner opened fire with an assault rifle 
on two Los Angeles police officers who had stopped his pickup in the 
Riverside County city of Corona.

During
 the resulting gun battle, one officer was grazed and the other was 
sprayed with shattered glass. Donner fled and a short time later shot 
two Riverside police officers, killing one.

'Both
 of these incidents were tragic for all involved, the officers who were 
injured in the first incident and the innocent women injured in the 
incident in the City of Torrance,' Soboroff said in a statement. 'As in 
all use of force incidents, the department has completed a thorough 
review and will adopt the lessons learned, both good and bad from these 
incidents.'

Soboroff 
said the Police Commission followed Beck's recommendation that the 
lethal use of force in Torrance was out of policy, making its 
determination after nearly three hours of discussion and months of 
investigation by the Police Department.

The
 same day that the women's pickup was shot up in Torrance, a police 
officer in that Los Angeles suburb opened fire on another pickup truck.

Torrance
 police Officer Brian McGee believed Dorner was in the truck when he 
rammed it and opened fire, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors 
who determined that his use of force was reasonable and declined to file
 criminal charges. McGee has not been disciplined by his agency.

David
 Perdue, of Redondo Beach, who was on his way to surf, wasn't shot but 
he suffered head and spinal injuries. The city of Torrance paid him 
$20,000 for the damage to his truck and he has filed a federal lawsuit.
