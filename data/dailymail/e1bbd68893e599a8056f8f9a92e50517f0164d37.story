It seems fans of the cult film Zulu were not the only ones fascinated by the renowned Battle of Rorke's Drift.

Queen Victoria, who was on the throne when the battle took place, was so enthralled by the celebrated battle that she ordered Lieutenant John Chard, the commanding officer, to give her a written report of what happened.

But, just like in the battle itself, Lieutenant Chard went above and beyond his call of duty - and decided to draw the queen five sketches showing a blow-by-blow account of how the battle unfolded.

Lieutenant John Chard - who later became a major - drew sketches to show Queen Victoria a step-by-step account of the Defence of Rorke's Drift, which took place in January 1879

Lieutenant Chard - who later became a major - also drew one landscape sketch, complete with a key, to give Queen Victoria the full picture of what happened when Zulu Warriors surrounded a British compound.

Now, those sketches have put been on display for the first time, as part of the Treasures From 
the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle.

In the 
drawings, the lieutenant tells Victoria that the sketches are drawn 
'chiefly from memory and therefore might not be quite correct'.

But he said it would give a 'fairly accurate impression' of the relative positions.

In the sketches, Chard uses red dots to show where the British soldiers moved and black dots to represent the Zulus.

He even includes gardens and bushes in the diagram, while showing in detail how the hospital - which, along with a supply depot, formed part of Rorke's Drift - was destroyed by fire.

He uses the caption: 'Darkness - completely surrounded.'

The battle, which became the subject of the movie Zulu in 1964,Â saw 150 soldiers fight off up to 4,000 Zulu Warriors.

The film, which is still celebrated more
 50 years after it was made, saw Stanley Baker play Lieutenant John 
Chard, while Michael Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead.

The success of the hand-to-hand combat came just hours after the Zulus achieved a resounding victory over the British troops during their first engagement at Isandlwana.

But this time, when some of the Zulu forces assaulted the British field station at Rorke's Drift, British soldiers repelled the attack, despite being heavily outnumbered.

The Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded.

Rorke's Drift was the base for B Company, 2nd Battallion, 24th Regiment of Foot.

Lieutenant Chard, the commander of No 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, found himself in charge of the men and, together with Lieutenant Bromhead, led the men into battle.

He was later awarded the Victoria Cross, praised for saving the lives of all but 17 of his men.

He was one of an incredible 11 men given the award.

The Anglo-Zulu war began in the late 1870s, when the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa.

Acting largely on his own initiative, the British High Commissioner presented the Zulu king Cetshwayo with an ultimatum with which he could not comply, subsequently sending a force to invade Zululand.

The exhibition, which includes dozens of other historic letters and pictures, opens today.
