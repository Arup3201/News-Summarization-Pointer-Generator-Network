QPR boss Harry Redknapp expects in-form striker Charlie Austin to be offered a new contract but denies Rangers are fighting off interest from other clubs.

Austin is the joint highest English goalscorer in the Barclays Premier League this season having scored seven goals, including the winner in a 3-2 victory over Leicester on Saturday.

The 25-year-old moved to Loftus Road in August 2013 and has only 18 months to run on his current deal.

'I'm sure the club would (like to extend his contract),' Redknapp said.

'I don't get involved in that, it's up to the chairman and (chief executive) Phil Beard.

'I'm sure everyone wants to keep Charlie here and I'm sure they'll be sitting down and talking to him.'

Austin's scintillating form, which has seen him score five goals in his last five matches, has reportedly alerted the likes of Tottenham and Liverpool.

Redknapp, however, insists Rangers have not fielded any enquiries for their star man and insists Austin still has to prove himself in the top flight.

'We've not had any enquiries from anyone else as far as I know,' Redknapp said.

'He's come into the Premier League and only played a dozen games.

'He's got a long, long way to go still - he knows that.

Both Liverpool and Tottenham have been credited with an interest in former Burnley and Swindon man Austin

'He's full of confidence, playing well, he's happy here and he's just got to keep going.'

Only six years ago, Austin was playing for Poole Town in the Sydenhams Football League - the ninth tier of the English Football League.

He scored 37 goals in 38 appearances for Poole that season and the former Burnley and Swindon forward has never hit less than 17 in a campaign since.

'He's going well at the moment but he needs to keep going well, it's only early in the season,' Redknapp said.

'He's a player who needs to get 20 goals this year.

'He's capable of getting 20 goals, he's been great for us and he's a great lad as well.

'I'm sure he's very happy here.'

Despite Austin' excellent start, QPR are keen to bolster their attacking options in January with FC Toronto striker Jermain Defoe still on Redknapp's radar.

'It depends how much it costs and what the deal is for Defoe,' Redknapp explained.

'There wouldn't be too many clubs who could afford him - he has a great contract where he is and it's going to be difficult to afford that.

'I love him as a player and a lad but it depends what the deal is.'

Redknapp added: 'We've got three strikers and they've all been excellent but in an ideal world you need four.

'You want to be able to change a game and freshen it up so that's something we'll look at if we can find the right person.'

QPR visit seventh-placed Swansea on Tuesday, looking to climb out of the bottom three for the first time since September.

'We'll have to go there and work very hard to stay with them,' Redknapp said.

'They play some great football, we know it'll be a tough game but we need an away win so we've got to be positive and believe we can go and get it.'
