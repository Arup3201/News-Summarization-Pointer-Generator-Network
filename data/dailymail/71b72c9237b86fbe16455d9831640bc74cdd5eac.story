A little sunshine could be good for your heart.

A short, sharp blast from a tanning lamp can cause blood pressure to fall, scientists have found.

The results suggest that well-meaning advice to avoid the sun to protect against skin cancer may in fact be raising the odds of  heart problems.

Getting some sunshine can lower blood pressure and cuts the risk of heart attacks or strokes, according to a recent study at Southampton University

With high blood pressure trebling the 
chance of heart attacks and strokes, researchers believe the benefits of
 sunlight may outweigh the risks of skin cancer.

The
 study by experts at Southampton and Edinburgh Universities exposed the 
skin of 24 healthy young men to a sun lamp for 20 minutes and measured 
their blood pressure.

Diastolic
 pressure – the lower of the two figures in a blood pressure reading – 
dropped significantly and remained low for at least half an hour after 
the lamp was switched off.

Studies
 into sunlight usually credit vitamin D with any health benefits, but in
 this case a different compound was at work. It is thought that the UVA 
rays emitted by the lamp triggered the release of a compound called 
nitric oxide from the skin.

Researchers have found sunshine can alter levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO), in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure

It then travelled to the blood vessels and relaxed them, causing blood pressure to fall.

The
 researchers wrote in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology that even
 a small drop in blood pressure cuts the risk of heart attacks and 
strokes.

Martin Feelisch, professor of experimental medicine at Southampton University, said: ‘Every little change might help.’

The
 findings could help explain why rates of heart disease go up in the 
winter – and why cardiac health is worse in countries further from the 
equator.

The professor said 
it will be important to check that the benefits are not limited to a 
quick blast of UV light in a lab but persist in the real world where 
people are exposed to sunlight every day. If the sun’s rays do prove to 
be beneficial for the heart, the professor said health advice on tanning
 should be reviewed.

He said that despite concern about skin cancer, heart disease is a far bigger killer.

In
 Britain, skin cancer kills  2,800 people a year while heart disease and
 strokes claim more than 160,000 lives annually and every seven minutes 
someone in the UK dies from a heart attack. Professor Feelisch said that
 fear of skin cancer has left some people scared of the sun.

Others may 
not be getting enough sunlight because they spend their work and leisure
 time indoors.

The study involved exposing the skin of 24 healthy individuals to ultraviolet (UVA) light from tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each. The results suggest that UVA exposure dilates blood vessels and significantly lowers blood pressure

He added: 
‘Avoiding excess sunlight exposure is critical to prevent skin cancer 
but not being exposed to it at all out of fear, or as a result of a 
certain lifestyle, could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We
 are concerned that well-meaning advice to reduce comparatively low 
numbers of deaths from skin cancer may inadvertently increase the risk 
of death from heart disease and stroke.’

He added that his research  is too preliminary to advise people on how much sun they should be getting.

n Sunshine can also ease the early stages of multiple sclerosis, a separate study found.

MS is a neurological condition affecting around 100,000 people in the UK, causing problems with vision, balance and the bladder.

Research
 by Harvard School of Public Health published in online journal JAMA 
Neurology found that boosting vitamin D could reduce the severity of MS.

Alberto
 Ascherio, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard, said: 
‘Because low vitamin D levels are common and can be easily and safely 
increased by oral supplementation, these findings may contribute to 
better outcomes for many MS patients.’
