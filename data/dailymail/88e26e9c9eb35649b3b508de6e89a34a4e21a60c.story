If you like the thought of using a smartwatch, but don’t want to ditch your traditional timepiece, then a new ‘invisible’ gadget may be the answer. California-based company, Kairos, has created a hybrid device, dubbed MSW 115, which features a mechanical watch alongside a hidden smartwatch.

According to Kairos, email and messages are delivered to the watch from a smartphone, as well as Facebook messages and other social media notifications.

‘You can use Kairos Watch as your remote control for your smart phone or tablet PC. Take camera shots from far away,’ the company writes on its website.

‘Control your music while walking. Send pre-set text messages while driving.’

The device also features a stopwatch and a fitness tracker that works with the watch’s sensors.

Powered by an ARM Cortex M4 chip, Kairos estimates that the battery inside the device could last a week.

The watch isn't currently available but can be pre-ordered. Prices start at $549 (£370) and rise to $1,249 (£810) for a limited edition version of 1,000 pieces.

Last year, the same company unveiled a product dubbed the T-Band, which a clip that adds similar smart tools to everyday, dumb watches.

The T-Band comes in three versions - a basic activity tracker, a simple touchscreen and an advanced notification display - with prices starting at $129 (£82).

Each band is adjustable and attaches to any watch with straps measuring between 0.7 inches and 0.9 inches (18mm and 24mm).

The T-Band ND is the basic model and works like a fitness band to track steps, sleep patterns and skin temperature.

It uses lights and vibrations to provide basic notifications, and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth.

Its steel case will be water resistant for up to three metres, while the basic band will be made out of leather
