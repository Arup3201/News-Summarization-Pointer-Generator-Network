A mobile phone designed for four to nine-year-olds has been launched by OwnFone. 

The 1stFone which has been dubbed the 'dumbphone for smart parents' is the size of a credit card and weighs 40g.

It can only make and receive calls, and it doesn't have a screen - instead it has the names of up to 12 close friends and family shown in a list with corresponding physical buttons.

The 1stFone, designed specifically for four to nine-year-olds can be customised. Options including Orange Splat, pictured front, Skulls, Leopard and more. The 12 pre-assigned contacts can only be changed and added to by a parent. A 999 button can also be added that must be pressed three times to activate

The 1stFone, from manufacturer OwnFone, has been specifically designed for four to nine-year-olds. It doesn't have a screen. Instead it shows a list of up to 12 pre-assigned contacts. The handset can only make and receive calls and a single battery charge can last a year when the handset is on standby

A couple recently designed software called C-Caller to give phones simple screen displays for people with poor vision.

Dena and Simon Marks came up with the idea after Dena's cataracts prevented her from reading the display on her mobile phone.

The pair developed the device to make phones display a large letter that relates to frequent callers.

For example, if someone called Victoria calls, a large V will appear.

Letters can be customised for different calls. 

This means that the child can only call the 12 pre-assigned numbers.

And only the parents can add or change this list of contacts.

Makers OwnFone believe that the basic functionality of the 1stFone reduces the risks of text or cyber bulling, finding inappropriate material online, 'sexting' or being mugged. 

They base this on a recent study from Southampton Rape Crisis of 7,000 school children which found those as young as 10 are routinely sending explicit pictures of themselves to classmates.

In the top-left hand corner of the handset are volume buttons, sat next to large Answer, and On/Off buttons.

The 1stFone has been designed to be hard-wearing and can withstand being thrown about and dropped by children. Makers OwnFone also believe the handset is perfect for seniors, as well as as an alternative to a work phone on a building site, for example. Clips can secure the phone to a child's clothing or a work belt

The child's name is also programmed to appear at the top of the handset. 

Children
can customise the handset with different colours and patterns including
'Green Dinosaur', 'Pink Leopard' or 'Orange Splat'.

In
addition to the 12 names, parents can also choose to have a 999 button 
programmed which has to be pressed three times to activate.

Makers OwnFone claim it can be used on a daily basis, or charged and kept only for emergencies. 

It adds that if the phone is charged and then stored away, it will hold that charge for up to a year later. 

Tom Sunderland, founder of OwnFone, said: 'In a world dominated by smartphones parents face a difficult choice when it comes to finding a first phone for their child.

'We wanted to design a fun product that appeals to children but puts parents in complete control and minimizes usage while still providing a vital connection between parent and child.'

The 1stFone costs from £55 and is available through the OwnFone website. 

The site also says that the 1stFone is ideal for seniors, as well as a work phone, because its been designed to be hard-wearing.  

OwnFone plans to launch the 2ndFone - an inexpensive handset that can be taken to festivals, for example.
