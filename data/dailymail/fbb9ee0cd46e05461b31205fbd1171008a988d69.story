Murder investigation: Rio Smedley, the baby who died in Bolton on Sunday

A murder investigation has been launched after a two-year-old boy was found dead at his home.

Rio Smedley was found unconscious at the two-bedroom home, in Bolton, Lancashire, yesterday evening after police were called following reports that his heart had stopped.

Medics rushed the toddler to the Royal Bolton Hospital but were unable to revive him.

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently being quizzed by detectives.

Leon's mother, Kirsty, in her 20s, is believed to be pregnant by the man now under arrest, who is not the dead boy's father.

Her oldest daughter, five-year-old Ella, is being comforted at her grandmother’s nearby home.

The arrested man and Kirsty were both at home in Bolton when police arrived. 

Rio’s family said in a tribute: 'Rio 
was the loving son of Kirsty, brother of Ella, grandson of Karen and 
Paddy, Gordon and Yvonne, nephew of Shaun and Jason.

'He will be greatly missed and the family now ask for some peace during this hard time.'

Neighbours said they were stunned by the news

Next-door neighbour Lilian Walkden, 70, said: 'I'm just so shocked. I was only holding that little boy a few days ago. I can still feel him in my arms saying "bye bye".'

She told how Kirsty had only been living in the street for a few weeks.

She added: 'He was such a lovely little boy and he always seemed happy.'

Fellow neighbour Simon Keegan said: 'It’s just really sad and our best wishes go out to all the family.'

Another neighbour said: 'I'm just absolutely shocked and stunned.'

Dozens of floral tributes, cards and teddy bears have been left outside the house in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet.

One card read: ‘Sleep in peace little angel’. Another said: ‘Rest in peace baby Rio. Taken too soon’.

Tragic: Rio Smedley was found unconscious at the two-storey home, in Bolton, Lancashire, after police were called following reports that his heart had stopped

Neighbour Natalie York, 31, a mother-of-eight, said she saw the drama unfold.

'They're just a normal family,' Ms York said.

'I
saw the police and ambulance around half four yesterday and heard the 
boy's mum screaming and the ambulance guy running out of the house with 
the boy in his arms.

'The ambulance shot off with flashing lights and sirens.

'I feel sick. I've got a two-year-old. It's horrible.'

Police said a post-mortem will be held to establish the boy's death at the Manchester Children's Hospital. 

Detective
Superintendent Jon Chadwick added: 'I would like to extend my 
sympathies to this young boy's family and friends at what is clearly a 
very difficult and emotional time for everyone.

'The
investigation is in the early stages and a dedicated team of detectives
will be working to establish exactly what happened.'

Bolton council said professional support will be made available to the family.
