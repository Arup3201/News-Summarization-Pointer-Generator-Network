'Wicked': Derrol Flynn used disguises and elaborate lies to con her elderly victims out of their money

A conwoman who posed as an undercover police officer to trick pensioners into handing over more than £20,000 has been jailed for eight years.

Serial fraudster Derrol Flynn, 40, convinced one of her victims she was being 'recruited' for an specialist undercover police investigation into banks.

But the elaborate scam was just a ploy to get innocent Diane Bastin to part with her money in the belief she was assisting an important police investigation.

The elderly woman was driven around Birmingham and ordered to purchase electrical items, cash cheques and take out loans.

Flynn, who was thought to be working as part of a gang, had such a hold over the 68-year-old that she refused to speak to genuine police officers for fear of breaching the Official Secrets Act.

Jailing Flynn, Judge Gregory Dickinson described the scam as 'wicked' and 'despicable'.

He said: 'I can only come to the conclusion that you are a menace to elderly members of the community.

'Only when you are locked up are they safe from you. These were serious offences and they were wicked.

'You took the items and she was left with the debt. Such was her bewilderment it took police officers a good while to convince her they were the genuine article.'

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Flynn was a serial con artist who used a number of ruses, posing as a nurse and other respectable workers, to dupe pensioners out of cash.

In another case, in June last year, an 85-year-old woman was conned into handing over her £3,000 life savings, kept for her funeral, after Flynn produced identification 'proving' who she was.

Behind bars: Flynn was jailed for eight years at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to burgle and commit fraud

Flynn, 40, of Bordesley Green, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and conspiracy to burgle.

Niall Skinner, defending, told the court she had shown remorse for the first time in a long career as a criminal.

Flynn was jailed for eight years for conspiracy to burgle and six years for conspiracy to commit fraud to be serves concurrently.

DCI Sarbjit Johal, who lead the investigation, said: 'She was wicked and preyed on the most vulnerable members of our community.

'Flynn has a history of offending against the old and infirm and the length of sentence reflects the despicable nature of these crimes.

'Anyone affected by bogus burglary should contact their local police, station to report it as soon as possible.

'We know how believable these burglars can be and would therefore encourage anything suspicious to be reported to police.

'A number of victims in these offences were traumatised not only losing money but also the fact they'd been duped, it is clearly not their fault these people are skilled and are very convincing.

'Flynn showed no remorse at all throughout her police interviews and we are very pleased that she will now be behind bars for a considerable time.'
