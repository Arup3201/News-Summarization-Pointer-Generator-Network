Bayern Munich fielded a non-German goalkeeper in the Bundesliga for the first time since 1988, as Pepe Reina replaced Manuel Neuer in a 4-0 win over Werder Bremen.

The former Liverpool man signed for Bayern in the summer, and his debut in the German top flight also makes him the first goalkeeper to play in all four of Europe's top leagues.

Robert Lewandowski took the plaudits, scoring twice as Bayern showed no signs of letting up at the top of the Bundesliga, swatting Werder Bremen aside with ease in a bad-tempered match that threatened to get out of hand.

Werder were undone by three goals from counter-attacks and a David Alaba free-kick, but did enough to rile the visitors to the point that defender Jerome Boateng, one of six players booked, became involved in an argument with a ball boy.

Runaway leaders Bayern, who have 64 points from 25 games, are now 14 clear of second-placed Wolfsburg who host Freiburg on Sunday afternoon.

Pep Guardiola's side, who have scored 34 goals in their last eight games in all competitions and thumped Werder 6-0 earlier in the season, went ahead in the 24th minute when Thomas Muller curled the ball in from the edge of the area following a counter-attack.

Despite missing Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben through injury, the leaders were as clinical as ever and Alaba chipped in a free kick in the last minute of the first half to make it 2-0.

Werder had a goal disallowed for handball by Sebastian Proedl in the second half, although the Austrian appeared to be pushed by Boateng, and the game turned ugly with several late tackles and heated exchanges between the players.

Almost inevitably Werder were caught on the break when Lewandowski grabbed two goals in the final quarter of an hour, both set up by Mueller after lightning attacks.

'We tried everything and attacked with courage for part of the game,' said Werder coach Viktor Skrypnyk. 'Overall it wasn't a bad performance, at least it was better than the 6-0 defeat.'

Earlier in the season, the reverse fixture finished 6-0, meaning that Bayern have put 10 past Bremen this term

Elsewhere, Joel Matip scored a last-minute equaliser as visiting Schalke twice came from behind to hold Hertha Berlin 2-2 while Anis Ben-Hatira was booked for putting on a spider man mask as he celebrated the opening goal for the hosts.

Eintracht Frankfurt brushed past Paderborn 4-0 and Hamburg SV are hovering just above the relegation zone after having goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny sent off in the 19th minute during a 3-0 defeat at Hoffenheim.

Eugen Polanski converted a penalty following Drobny's foul and later added a second as Hamburg were left in 15th, one place and two points clear of Paderborn who are in the relegation playoff spot.

Last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are 10th after they were held 0-0 at home by Cologne.
