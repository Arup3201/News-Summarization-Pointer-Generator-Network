A pizza delivery guy brought a huge order to the Dolby Theatre on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood on Sunday only to be roped into appearing onstage at the Oscars.

Edgar, pictured below at work at Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria in Hollywood, was fulfilling an order for five of the chain's specialty Big Papa's and a selection of smaller pies.

After the slices were consumed, host Ellen DeGeneres collected hundreds of dollars from Brad Pitt and Harvey Weinstein to tip the man, but he never saw that cash, according to TMZ.

'It's pretty clear he had no idea Ellen passed Pharrell's hat around and scored around $300,' wrote the site.

The pizza parlor did end up getting a lot of free publicity however, as advertising on the show costs at least $1.8m, according to Variety. The publicity coup is thought to be worth about $10million to the pizza chain.

Ellen had roped him into joining her onstage - where he helped hand out pieces among a room full of multimillionaires, with recipients including Brad, Jennifer Lawrence, Jared Leto, Julia Roberts, Kerry Washington and Meryl Streep.

As Ellen persuaded the stars to dig in, the bemused delivery guy doled out the squares behind her.

The
 sheepish delivery man followed Ellen around the front seats of the 
auditorium and the host later passed around a Pharrell Williams-like big
 hat to gather tips for the pizza delivery from the stars.

A source from the chain told MailOnline: 'Yes, we did [deliver the pizza]. We had a couple of guys during the Oscars.

'It was five Big Papas at 60 square slices each. But they got a bunch more, those were just the big ones.'

But he said  the delivery guy had no warning he would be making a cameo in front of millions of TV viewers.
