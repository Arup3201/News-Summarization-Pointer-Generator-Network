Harrowing video shows a US Airways plane landing without its nose gear in Houston on Monday night after a malfunction.

With 53 passengers aboard, the Embraer 190 touched down and skidded on its nose along the runway - causing sparks to fly out on both sides.

Flight 1825 from Philadelphia was preparing to land at George Bush Intercontinental Airport at 10pm when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. 

The pilots of the commuter jet had no choice but to make an emergency landing. 

Touchdown: Sparks can be seen flying from US Airways Flight 1825 after it was forced to land in Houston without its nose gear

Fire: The flight landed at 10.23pm. The Houston Fire Department was on the scene and the reported fire was extinguished around 10.40pm

Passengers: Passengers had to deplane using chutes and one was transported to a local hospital with unknown injuries

'56 souls on board 3,000 pounds of gas and we plan on evacuating on the runway ... emergency in progress,' according to air tower radio traffic. 

A video from KTRK shows huge sparks under the nose of the plane as it touched down on the runway. 

Firefighters met the plane on the runway and passengers used emergency exit chutes on both sides of the craft. 

One person sustained a minor injury during the landing and evacuation and was hospitalized. 

'They did a couple turns around the airport airspace, talked to the FAA tower, tried to get visual confirmation that the nose gear was in fact inoperable,' airport spokesman  David Hebert told KHOU-TV. 

'Unfortunately it wasn't working properly.'

As the pilot touched down, smoke filled the cabin - likely from the friction caused by the nose-landing. 

US Airways and the Federal Aviation Administration said they are investigating why the landing gear didn't work. 

Decisions: A spokesperson with the airport said that the pilot noticed that the landing gear was not coming down and decided to make the landing
