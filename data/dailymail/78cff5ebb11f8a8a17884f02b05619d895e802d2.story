Rebekah Bletsch, 36, was fatally shot in the head while out for a jog in Dalton Township, Michigan on Sunday

A murder investigation is underway after a married mother, who was initially thought to have been killed in a hit-and-run, was discovered to have a gunshot wound to the head.

The body of Rebekah Bletsch, 36, was 
found on Sunday along a quiet road in Dalton Township, Michigan where 
she lived with her husband and 11-year-old daughter.

Mrs Bletsch last spoke to a family member at 5pm before she was found by strangers on the deserted road less than an hour later. 

Attempts to resuscitate her failed and she was pronounced dead at the scene, less than a mile from her home.

It is believed that the 36-year-old had gone for a jog as she was found with headphones and an armband to hold a cellphone.

Initially her death was thought to be a hit-and-run but on closer inspection of the scene, investigators found shell casings.

An examination of her body found that she had a bullet wound to the head. The results of a full autopsy are expected to be released later today.

Muskegon County Sheriff's office are trying to work out a motive for the mother's brutal death and have set up a task force to investigate the homicide.

The 36-year-old mother was found on this deserted road on Sunday around 6pm. She was known to jog along the route daily

It is not believed to be a robbery as valuable items were left at the scene, an investigator said.

Her husband is not being considered a suspect, according to the sheriff's office. He was out of town at the time with the couple's 11-year-old daughter.

Mrs Bletsch's cellphone records are being examined to see if she was in touch with anyone before she died.

Tim Donkin, her husband's uncle, told ABC: 'There’s no scenario that makes sense, 
can bring any kind of understanding to what transpired.'

He added: 'Becky was not just a person running down the road - she had a life.'

A neighbor Tammy Pierce told WZZM that the married mother jogged down the road daily. She said that her body was found near a neighbor's mailbox but where there were no houses. 

Several yellow circles mark where police found the shell casings from the bullets.
