Claire Smedley says that she is blessed with the biggest cleavage in Britain, but today the 30-year-old revealed on This Morning that she hasn't always been so confident about her curves.

The mother-of-three hit the headlines recently after she admitted to almost suffocating her ex-boyfriend with her colossal 40MMM breasts. Her current partner Chris Willgoose has invented a 'warning system' where he taps her legs to flag up any danger moments when they are getting intimate.

Today pink-haired Claire from Derby is confident about her figure, even using it to make some money as a part-time model, but in her first TV appearance she told This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that she received some startling early advice from her local church group.

Claire Smedley claims that she has the biggest breasts in Britain and appeared on This Morning today in her first TV interview

Claire says that her breasts grew almost overnight when she was 11 and along with her new chest came cruel bullying.

Aged 12 she was already a DD cup and by the age of 16 she was wearing a H cup bra.

She said: 'They stuck out so much, I was tiny with massive boobs. Kids used to undo my bra in class or make me run so they could laugh as they moved around.

'People jump to conclusions when you look like that and think certain things when in fact it couldn't have been more different, I was actually very shy.

Claire Smedley, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she is always on her guard during sex after her ex-boyfriend nearly suffocated

'I was very involved in the church all my free time was spent there.

'I
was pulled aside a few times and told that what I was wearing wasn't 
appropriate, even though I was wearing the same clothes as the other 
girls.

'Finally I was 
pulled aside and told that I should consider having a breast reduction 
because it wasn't fair on the men in the group and I was distracting 
them.

'That was the sign for me to go completely the other way and I said: right, I'm going to go out clubbing.

'I decided to do all the things that I had never done and I went from totally shy to in your face confident overnight.'

During
the interview Holly held up one of Claire's bras to illustrate the size
of her breasts, shocked at the amount of fabric she said: 'Can you 
actually buy bras like this?'

Holly held up one of Lisa's L cup bras, which is the largest available on the high street and still several sizes too small

Claire has decided against a breast reduction and instead hopes that her glamour modelling career will take off

Claire claims that her breasts weigh 
five stone (2.5 stone each), and that although she likes having bib 
boobs now it does have its downsides.

She said: 'My shoulders ache and I 
can't get bras that fit. The biggest size that the high street does is 
an 'L' so I squeeze in to them.

'I have had a consultation about having breast reduction but I don't want to take the risk.'

Instead, Claire is focusing her efforts on turning her huge chest in to a positive part of her life.

She said: 'I've already done a few 
modelling shoots, and through the internet I have realised men like 
women of all shapes and sizes.

'Who knows what might happen in the next few months?'

Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and her large breasts

Claire said she has considered a breast reduction in the past but was told it was not an option because her BMI is too high for surgery
