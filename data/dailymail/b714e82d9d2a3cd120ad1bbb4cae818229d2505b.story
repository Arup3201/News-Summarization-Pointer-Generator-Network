Arsenal's players looked champing at the bit as they reported back for pre-season training at their London Colney headquarters on Tuesday, although there was one notable absentee.

The Gunners had a spring in their step after ending their long wait for a trophy with their FA Cup final victory against Hull in May.

One key figure who wasn't at London 
Colney though, was Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. The Frenchman has been in Brazil 
working as a television pundit for the duration of the World Cup, which meant coach Steve Bould took charge of the first training session of the season.
