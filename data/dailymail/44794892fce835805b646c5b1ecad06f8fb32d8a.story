Sally Roberts leaves the High Court after the judge ruled her son should have radiotherapy

A seven-year-old cancer sufferer can have radiotherapy against his mother's wishes, a High Court judge ruled today.

Mr Justice Bodey said he was worried 
Sally Roberts judgement had 'gone awry' after doctors said her son Neon 
could die within months if he did not get it.

Mrs Roberts, 37, a New Zealander who 
lives in Brighton, East Sussex, fears that undergoing the treatment 
would cause long-term damage to her son - such as a lowered IQ and 
fertility damage.

However, today the judge, who heard 
evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in 
London, ruled against her, adding: 'One cannot enjoy a quality of life 
if one isn't alive.'

Specialists treating Neon accepted 
that there were side-effects to radiotherapy but said that without the 
treatment the youngster could be dead within three months.

Neon was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour and underwent an operation to remove it on October 25th this year.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are 
routine follow-up treatments which doctors said would give Neon up to an
86 per cent chance of survival.

The ideal time to start this is within
28 days of surgery taking place, but the delay means his chances of 
surviving are now down to 67 per cent.

The court heard his mother missed three vital hospital appointments.

She then sparked a manhunt after going into hiding with him for four days without telling his dad Ben.

The pair were found safe and well and Neon, who has a twin sister, was put into the care of his father.

The hearing was told she would not let
doctors give him anti-sickness drugs after a brain operation this week 
to remove a tumour.

When given the chance to put forward 
alternative treatments for her son at the High Court, Mrs Roberts’s 
suggestions were labelled ‘completely unethical’.

She then asked for more time to look into alternative therapies after researching on the internet but this was refused. 

Doctors called to give evidence told 
the court: 'This boy has a very highly malignant disease and he will die
very quickly unless somebody gets their hands on him to treat him.'

Case: Neon Roberts is at the centre of a legal dispute over his own cancer treatment

Experts said the UK was one of the 
leading countries on the disease and that if parents looked elsewhere 
they would be 'doing their child a disservice.'

After hearing the case over four days 
Mr Justice Bodey said: 'Before radiotherapy was developed patients 
variably and also invariably died.'

He said he found it hard to believe 'caring clinicians' would keep back alternative therapies which would work on children.

Delivering his judgment, he said: 'The mother has been through a very stressful time.

'This sort of news is every parent's 
worst nightmare, and I have sympathy for her, but I'm worried that her 
judgment was gone awry on the question of the seriousness of the threat 
which Neon faces.

'There was a time when she agreed with
the therapy. I express the hope that when the mother has reflected on 
the outcome she will come to terms with it.

'I am sure she will support Neon through the very difficult times he has ahead. He needs both his parents to support him.'

The judge said the case 'tilted well in the favour' of Neon's father and the hospital trust.

Mrs Roberts, who admitted she 
'panicked' when she ran off with Neon, is now banned from applying for a
passport until December 2013.

The hospital trust, which has not been
identified, asked for their costs to be paid by Mrs Roberts on the 
grounds she put matters back when took Neon without his father's 
knowledge.

Mrs Roberts said she 'was not a bonkers mother'

But Ian Peddie QC, representing her, told the court his client had no money.

Neon will now live with his dad for the next year while he undergoes treatment before living permanently with his mother again.

Mrs Roberts, who stared intently at the judge as the decision was read out, was told she could not appeal the case in the High Court.

Ms Roberts had told the court she was not a 'bonkers mother'.

She said she feared that radiotherapy would reduce Neon's intelligence quotient (IQ), shorten his life, put him at risk of having strokes and make him infertile.

And she told the judge that she wanted medics to consider alternatives.

Neon's father Ben said he was 'relieved' following the decision to give it the go ahead today.

Ben Roberts was with his son Neon in hospital so was not at the hearing at the to hear the judgement handed down.

In a statement issued following today's ruling his solicitor Gwen Williams said: 'Mr Roberts is relieved that the judge has been able to make a final ruling on Neon's treatment.

'Neon's health and recovery has always been Mr Roberts' priority. While he respected Neon's mother's views, his own opinion, following in depth discussions with doctors, has always been that Neon should have the treatment.

'He now hopes Neon can be allowed to recover from his latest operation and start the radiotherapy and chemotherapy that the doctors have outlined without further delay.'

She said Mr Roberts was grateful for the careful way Mr Justice Bodey had made his decision and for the sympathy he had shown to his family.

He also thanked medical teams treating Neon and 'for the great time and energy that have devoted to issues in the case.'
