A Canadian tourist was stuck dangling  about 80 feet above a street for nearly an hour after a Las Vegas zip line attraction malfunctioned Friday. 

Firefighters rescued the man from the Fremont Street Experience's 114-foot SlotZilla zip line at 3.08pm, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. 

After taking off from the zip line, which begins from a 12-story slot machine sending riders on a 1,750-foot long trip, the trolley that ran along the cable jammed, suspending the man in the air.
