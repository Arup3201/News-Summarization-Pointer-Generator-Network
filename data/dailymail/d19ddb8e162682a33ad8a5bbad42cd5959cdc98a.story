Pippa Middleton's jaunt in the Big Apple continued today as the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister spent the afternoon skating with friends in a New York park.

Pictured on the street outside The Carlyle, the Upper East Side hotel where she has been staying since she arrived at the weekend, Pippa made the most of the sunny weather Stateside.

She has certainly made the most of her stay, packing a constant stream of glittering engagements into a few short days.

Fit: Sporty Pippa dressed casually in a heart-print red top and pale jeans - and kept the sun off her face with an NYC cap

Last night she dined at fashionable Le
 Bernardin restaurant, which brought to an end a heady few days where 
she had been whisked out by private plane to the exclusive Hamptons 
resort by one of the richest men in the country and enjoyed dinner at 
some of the city’s top restaurants.

Yesterday
 the 28-year-old arrived at the US Open in Flushing Meadows with a 
pass for the tennis courtesy of Wimbledon champion Roger Federer.

Dressed in a colour block shift dress,
 tortoiseshell shades and her favourite nude wedges, she looked every 
inch the confident Park Avenue princess.

There is speculation that party 
planner Pippa, who is due to celebrate her 29th birthday on Thursday, 
may also attend New York Fashion Week.

Pippa – an assiduous networker who 
once shared a flat with the sons of two Dukes – began her trip on 
Saturday by checking in to the Upper East Side’s Carlyle Hotel (where 
suites can cost up to £10,000) with a couple of girlfriends.

Travelling in style: Pippa and her friends were taken to Balazs' resort at the Hamptons on his seaplane, which costs $525 for a one-way trip or more than $3,200 to commission a personal flight

Pippa
 Middleton arrived in New York City this weekend and has enjoyed the 
city's more luxurious perks, although it is unclear what exactly she has
 paid for. Among her expenses:

The following day she met up with 
fabulously rich hotelier Andre Balazs, who flew her on his pillar-box 
red sea plane to his Sunset Beach boutique hotel on Shelter Island.

Dressed in red jeans and a white 
cleavage-enhancing shirt, Pippa was seen walking through the hotel, 
laughing and giggling at the perma-tanned 55-year-old divorcee’s jokes.

Balazs, who is said to be worth 
£300million and has been romantically linked with Uma Thurman, owns 
eight luxury hotels across the US including the Chateau Marmont in LA 
and The Mercer in New York.

He and Pippa were photographed playing
 table tennis together and rode around in his cream and red VW van 
snapping photographs with four companions.

That night the group shared an 
intimate dinner, with fellow diners saying there was a ‘definite 
chemistry’ between Pippa and Balazs.

‘They didn’t seem like a couple but 
there was a lot of flirting going on and when dinner ended he gave her a
 friendly European-style double kiss on the cheek,’ said one.

According to the New York Post, the 
pair talked a great deal of ‘business’.  Pippa is, after all, about to 
bring out her first book on entertaining entitled Celebrate: A Year of 
Festivities for Families and Friends.

‘She shares his interest in hospitality,’ a source told the newspaper.

When ‘fans’ recognised her, Pippa 
apparently agreed to pose for pictures and was, by all accounts, ‘really
 nice and very friendly’.

There was no sign of her on-off 
boyfriend Alex Loudon, who reportedly dumped Pippa last year after 
becoming uncomfortable with the growing publicity around her. Friends 
say that in recent months they have begun to slowly rekindle their 
romance.

After parting company with Balzas, Pippa made a trip to the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking District, where she was seen chatting to former New York Ranger Sean Avery, the New York Daily News reported.

'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk Studios.

She also reportedly met Gossip Girl actor Chase Crawford, 27, at the bar, with a witness telling Us Weekly the pair 'spoke for 10 minutes'.

The trip to the beach-side resort 
came a day after Pippa and two friends popped by their pricey Upper East
 Side hotel, the Carlyle, where rooms cost as much as $15,000 a night.

Stepping out: On Tuesday, Ms Middleton was pictured attending the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York

They
 went to Meatpacking District seafood hotspot Catch, where they enjoyed 
Chef Hung Huynh's rice cakes, crispy shrimp, salmon carpaccio, scallop 
dumplings and sushi, People reported.

Just
 over an hour later, Pippa, who was wearing a sleek green dress, went 
for quiet drinks before hailing a cab and returning to the hotel.

Pippa, who was pictured cheering 
alongside her sister at the Wimbledon tournament earlier this year, also
 squeezed in a spot of tennis as she visited the US Open on Tuesday.

She wore a close-fitting orange, lime
 green and navy blue knee-length dress - that showed off her famous 
derriere - with a basket handbag and beige wedge heels as she arrived for the tournament.

She finished off the outfit with a pair of £120 Bosworth Rosewood Sunglasses from FINLAY & CO.

There is also speculation that Pippa might make an appearance at New York's 
Fashion Week, which started on Monday at the Lincoln Center.

The stylish set are keeping her name 
on any show or party guest lists, should she wish to attend, the New 
York Daily News reported.

Her trip, during which she 
is apparently courting the perks of fame, comes despite her demands to 
remain out of the public gaze.

While newspapers have respected her request to be recognised as a private citizen, she still very much seems to be enjoying the high-flying life of a socialite.

Despite her request, US news sites chose to publish photographs of her playing table tennis with Balazs, but MailOnline has respected her wishes.

Pippa is in town for meetings over her new book, which is out on October 30. She will not be holding any publicity events for the book while she is here, Viking publishers said.

Billed
 as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative 
entertaining', it is a book she hopes will cement her credentials as a 
party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small 
fortune in the process.

Into the spotlight: Pippa became a household name after her sister's wedding, right, last year. Even though she has requested privacy from the press, she has put out a new book featuring her picture, left

Connections: Pippa with her sister Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, while at Wimbledon earlier this year

The cover's patchwork quilt-style design of pictures of Pippa may come as a surprise to some readers, however, as Miss Middleton has strongly defended her right to privacy in recent years.

Whether Miss Middleton will be able to maintain her position that she is a private citizen following the book's release remains to be seen.

Her first tome is expected to generate much publicity, and it was reported last month that she has negotiated a six-figure book deal with publishers Michael Joseph, the branch of the Penguin Group that deals with ‘highly commercial’ properties.

Miss Middleton's book deal has attracted criticism, with some observers accusing her of cashing in on her sister Kate's position as a senior Royal.
