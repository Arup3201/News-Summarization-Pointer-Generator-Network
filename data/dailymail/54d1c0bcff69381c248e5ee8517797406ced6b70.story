Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had a blazing row with their former Rolling Stones bandmate Brian Jones on the day he died, culminating in Richards drawing a knife, according to an extraordinary claim made to police.

In a bizarre twist in the mystery, The Mail on Sunday has seen documents in which the daughter of the man now thought to have been involved in Jones’s death claims that the Stones’ former guitarist was confronted at his East Sussex home by Jagger and Richards over who owned the rights to the group’s name.

Back again: This was the first time the Rolling Stones played Hyde Park since their concert 44 years ago, two days after Brian Jones was found dead

Hours later Jones was found dead in his swimming pool.

The unsubstantiated claims, contained in an internal police report, were dismissed by officers, but will add further fuel to the conspiracy theories that surround Jones’s death in 1969 and question whether he really did drown under the influence of drink and drugs.

The allegation comes after the Stones played in front of 65,000 fans at London’s Hyde Park last night, re-enacting the emotive tribute they gave for Jones at the same venue 44 years ago.

Last night’s concert was the first time the Stones have played at the park since their requiem for Jones two days after he was found dead.

The source of the claim is Jan Bell, the daughter of Frank Thorogood, Jones’s builder-cum-minder who was present at Jones’s farm on the night of his death.

Thorogood died in 1993. A year later, it was claimed that he had murdered Jones.

Sussex Police appealed on TV for information and Bell telephoned them about the alleged incident.

Her father told her that he intervened in the row between Jones and Richards, she claimed.

Titled ‘Briefing Note: Death of Brian Jones’, the police report states: ‘She said that her father had told her a number of years ago that on the day of Brian’s death, Messrs Mick JAGGER and Keith RICHARDS visited Brian JONES at the farm in the morning and her father was present when Brian was asked by both men whether he would give up the name of the “Rolling Stones” to them and agree to a financial settlement.

‘Brian apparently declined to do  so and it is alleged that Keith RICHARDS drew a knife. It is suggested that THOROGOOD calmed them down and both JAGGER and RICHARDS left the house.’Brian Jones started and named The Rolling Stones in 1962.

Last night, a Rolling Stones spokesman declined to comment on the claim. After the report was written, no further action was taken because a senior officer in Sussex Police intervened to block standard investigating procedures, it is alleged.

The Mail on Sunday has traced  the police officer who interviewed Jan Bell.

The officer, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I arranged to meet lawyers representing Mick Jagger and Keith Richards – two firms, one in New York and one in Los Angeles – to talk specifically about Jan Bell’s statement to Sussex Police, about them being at the house on the day of the death and about the knife being drawn.

‘But the Assistant Chief Constable intervened and blocked me from meeting the Stones’ lawyers. The ACC drew a line under it.

The statements made to Sussex Police by Jan Bell should have led to what the police call standard “trace and eliminate” work – to prove or disprove any information the police have been given, and to work out if something did or did not take place.

‘But I was told to put details of Jan Bell’s interview into a report, and that was it.’

The astounding allegation is the most startling piece of material that The Mail on Sunday has uncovered about Brian Jones’s death.

However, our enquiries have also brought to light further claims about what one band member may privately have suspected about it.

The Mail on Sunday has ascertained that as far back as the 1980s, Richards was aware of suspicions that Frank Thorogood killed Jones, and that Tom Keylock, a Stones manager, had led a cover-up.

Robert Greenfield, an American author and a former editor of Rolling Stone magazine, lived with  Richards in the South of France in May 1971, during the recording of the Stones’ album Exile On Main Street.

Greenfield recorded hours of conversations with Richards during this period, which reveal that the guitarist was aware of the alleged cover-up that Keylock – who Richards called Mr Get-It-Together – put in place.

Richards told Greenfield about the aftermath of Jones’s death: ‘I wanted to know who was there and couldn’t find out. The only cat I could ask was the one I think got rid of everybody and did the whole disappearing trick so when the cops arrived, it was just an accident.

'Maybe it was. Maybe the cat just wanted to get everyone out of the way so it wasn’t all names involved, etc. Maybe he did the right thing, but I don’t know. I don’t even know who was there that night, and trying to find out is impossible.’

There is also new evidence that in the 1980s Richards was aware of Thorogood’s alleged involvement in Jones’s death, via Patrick Townshend, a former business partner of Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman.

He’s the 69-year-old frontman of a band famed for rock’n’roll excesses.

But it seems time has finally caught up with Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.

He revealed that he prepared for last night’s Hyde Park concert by getting up early to do his chores.

On his Twitter page, Jagger posted a picture of himself sitting on a leather sofa in salmon-coloured jeans and a somewhat creased pink shirt.

With his hand resting on an iPad and a black ‘manbag’ on the sofa beside him, he added: ‘Beautiful day in London, can’t wait for the show.

'Been up early ironing my clothes.’
