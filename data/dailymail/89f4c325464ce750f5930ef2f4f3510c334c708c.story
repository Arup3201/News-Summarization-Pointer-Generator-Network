Almost two years ago, Martin Murray fought on the undercard of Ricky Hatton's ill-fated comeback in Manchester.

Standing in the way of a world title shot against Sergio Martinez was Jorge Navarro, an unbeaten but limited Venezuelan.

In the end, the 27-year-old offered little resistance, going down in the first and sixth rounds before the fight was stopped before it reached the halfway point.

Now Murray, who went on to lose narrowly to Martinez in Buenos Airies the following April, is in a similar position. 

This time the prize on the table is a shot at the much-feared and much-avoided world champion Gennady Golovkin.

In Monte Carlo on Saturday night, Murray faces Domenico Spada in the final fight of his current deal with South Africa-based promoter Golden Gloves.

The Italian, who brings a record of 39 victories from 44 contests, is as wily as he is tough and will be no gimme for the St Helens man.

Stopped just once by recent Golovkin victim Marco Antonio Rubio, Spada is awkward, even underhand at times, but has promised he is in the principality to win.

‘He’s experienced,’ said Murray. ‘His style is horrible and awkward but it works for him. You look at videos of him and think he looks very beatable. He looks like he’s got nothing about him.

‘But then you look at his record and look at the people he has fought and beat and you start to realise that he makes his style work for him.’

Spada took former world champion Darren Barker the 12-round distance three years ago in a European title fight and did the same to Sebastian Zbik in their two battles.

Murray will know, however, that if he can’t navigate a way past the veteran, he has no right to share a ring with Golovkin.

The Kazakh will be ringside at the Salle des etoiles following his 18th consecutive stoppage victory over Rubio in Los Angeles last weekend.

And he is penciled in to return to Monaco on February 21 for what will be his third visit.

‘People talk about Golovkin and you’ve got to answer questions about it, but the more people I get asking me about it, the more I get motivated to do a proper job on Spada this Saturday night,’ said Murray.

‘I knew I had a world title shot against Sergio Martinez back in 2013, but I still had to go out there and beat Jorge Navarro to get it. It’s the same on Saturday. If I don’t beat Spada, there’s no world title fight.

‘For that reason, I’m completely focused on Spada and am not thinking about Golovkin one bit. In fact, I didn’t even watch his fight against Marco Antonio Rubio at the weekend. I just completely ignored it. Instead, I stuck on a DVD of Spada that morning to keep me focused.’

Murray’s defeat to Martinez was his second unsuccessful world title challenge following his contentious draw with Felix Sturm in 2011.

The 32-year-old middleweight fought just four times over the following two years, eventually breaking ties with Hatton to sign a seven-figure, three-fight deal with Golden Gloves.

A stoppage win over Ishmael Tetteh and a wide points win over Max Bursak have helped build much-needed momentum.

‘I wouldn’t have been ready for a world title shot this year,’ added Murray. ‘But I feel like I’m just getting into my prime and I can beat any middleweight in the world.’

First, he must take care of Spada. For now, Golovkin can wait.
