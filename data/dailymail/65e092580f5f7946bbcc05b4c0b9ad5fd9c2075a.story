A baby born with a rare condition will never be able to smile, cry, frown or show any facial expression.

Cody James, who is 13 months old, also has to roll his eyes to keep them moist because he cannot blink.

He was born with Moebius syndrome, a rare condition that affects just two out of every million children.

Rare condition: Cody James, pictured with his parents Kim Eastwell and Talan James, was born with Moebius syndrome and will never be able to smile, cry, frown or show any facial expression

There are only 124 children with the condition in Britain, said his parents, Kim Eastwell and Talan James, of Helston, Cornwall.

Miss Eastwell said: 'He is so clever, and he is gorgeous. My heart breaks that I will never see my son smile at me.'

Moebius syndrome is present at birth and affects some cranial nerves, leaving sufferers unable to move their faces.

The left-hand side of Cody’s body is also affected.

Mrs Eastwell said that she and her husband panicked when Cody was born because he did not scream or cry.

After a while, they noticed his facial palsy was not improving, he was not supporting himself, or smiling.

She said: 'All I could hear was the other babies crying, I cried myself to sleep that night.'

But it was not until the couple later saw an eye specialist - after being told the problem was nerve damage which would repair itself - that Cody was diagnosed with the incurable syndrome.

Miss Eastwell said: 'Cody doesn’t sit up or crawl but he does roll and has one cheeky personality.

'Even though he doesn’t smile we all know he’s happy with his dirty, cheeky little laugh. He’s making so much progress, everything Cody does he has to work ten times harder for.

'At the end of the day you don’t give up on your baby.'

Now Miss Eastwell and Mr James are determined to help other children with Moebius syndrome by raising money for research into the condition.

On Saturday, the Lizard Fundraising Fair near Kynance, Cornwall, will be raising money for the Moebius Syndrome Foundation as well as Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust.
