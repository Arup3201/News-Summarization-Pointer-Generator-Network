Suspected Islamist militants have killed at least 15 people in an overnight raid on a Kenyan coastal area.

The attack comes just 24 hours after a separate raid in a nearby town left 53 dead.

The bodies of 15 people were discovered among the remains of torched houses in Majembeni and neighbouring Poromoko, which are on the Kenyan coast between Mombasa and the Somali border.

Al-Shabaab militants 
claimed responsibility for the overnight attack on their radio station 
Andalus, but said they had in fact murdered 20 people.

This afternoon, the BBC had been told that 12 women were abducted.This was later proved not to be the case.

But
 in a surprising turn of events, Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta later 
said that despite al-Shabaab's claims, 'domestic political leaders' were
 behind the massacres, not Islamic extremists.

Majembeni - the area in which the 15 bodies were discovered - is close to the village of Mpeketoni, where 53 people were brutally killed in a raid on Sunday while they watched the World Cup.

Local residents said militants also entered a third village, Mapenya, overnight, burning several homes to the ground, according to Kenya's Standard Digital.

One witness said armed men went door to door hours before dawn in Majembeni and the neighbouring Poromoko village, ordered people outside and made them recite the Islamic creed.

He said he did not see what happened to those that failed the test, but assumed they had been beaten or killed.

Police are continuing to search Majembeni and Poromoko for bodies and the death toll is expected to rise over the coming hours.

However, in a nationally televised address this afternoon, Kenya's president dismissed widely held belief that Islamist militants were behind the attacks, instead blaming 'domestic political leaders'.

His surprising allegations come despite witness testimonies to the contrary, and analysis by terror experts who say the method of killing is very much in the al-Shabaab style.

Mr Kenyatta blamed the attacks instead on ethnically-motivated violence inspired by local political leaders who are preaching the idea that some Kenyans are 'less human' than others.

The back-to-back attacks underscore the weak security around the Lamu area, which lies just south of the Somalia border.

Lamu
 once attracted swarms of foreign visitors - including a large number of
 Britons - but its tourist sector has been suffering in recent years 
because of increasing violence.

These recent suspected al-Shabaab attacks now threaten to shut that industry down altogether.

'These attacks are unfortunate and 
the perpetrators must be held accountable,' Interior Minister Joseph Ole
 Lenku this morning told residents in Mpeketoni, where he was jeered by locals.

'This government is full of talk and no action,' said one angry resident, speaking as the minister arrived in the town.

'They keep saying the country is safe, and we keep on suffering in the hands of terrorists.'

Kenya's president has blamed domestic political leaders for the deadly coastal attacks.

In a nationally televised address, Uhuru Kenyatta said that despite claims of responsibility from al-Shabaab, the Islamic extremists were not behind the massacres.

Terror experts have also said the method of killing is in the al-Shabaab style, with gunshots to the head or victims having their throats cut.

But in a surprising turn of events, Mr Kenyatta said outright that al-Shabaab did not plan and execute what he termed ethnically motivated violence, but rather local political leaders.

He said police officials in Mpeketoni had advance intelligence about the attack there on Sunday evening but failed to act on it.

He added that some officers have been suspended and will be prosecuted.

Mr Kenyatta also said some political leaders are preaching the idea that some Kenyans are less human than others.

'My deputy and I will never go the route of ethnic violence,' he went on to say.

Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, today claimed the group's gunmen killed as many as 20 people in the Majembeni assault, including policemen.

'Our operations in Kenya will continue,' he said.

Omar Awadh Salim, a 48-year-old father of two, said masked men in military fatigues broke into his house and other properties in Poromoko just after 1 a.m. this morning.

'They ordered all of us to get out of the house, and then asked us to recite 'shahada'. We all did and they let us back into the house and proceeded to the next,' he told Reuters.

Ole Lenku has defended his government's security efforts.

But many Kenyans have publicly called for him and other top officials to be fired for security shortcomings including failings during the four-day Westgate siege, where some soldiers involved were found to have looted the mall after 67 people were killed.

The Sunday night attack took place in the coastal village of Mpeketoni - 30-miles southwest of Lamu - and left 53 people dead.

Witnesses told how about 30 gunmen arrived in the town in minibuses at 8pm yesterday before bursting into residents homes, shooting dead any man they thought was not Muslim.

'They came to our house at around 8pm and asked us in Swahili whether we were Muslims,' said Anne Gathigi. 'My husband told them we were Christians and they shot him in the head and chest.'

The assault in Mpeketoni began on Sunday night as residents watched World Cup matches on TV and lasted until early on Monday morning, with little resistance put up by Kenya's security forces.
