Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was given 18 months over the ill-treatment of four patients at Roundstone Care Residential Home in Filey, North Yorkshire

A care home boss branded a female 'Darth Vader' for turning the lives of dementia sufferers into a 'nightmare' was today jailed for 18 months. 

Sentencing Siobhan Koralewski, 30, Judge Howard Crowson warned that patients mistreated in care homes were becoming Britain's 'voiceless victims'.

Ms Koralewski was last month found guilty of five counts of neglect and ill-treatment of four patients in the Roundstone Care Home in Filey, North Yorkshire, where she worked as a senior carer. 

Ms Koralewski bit one 88-year-old man between the legs and pulled a 'wedgie' on another patient in the care home which promised specialist treatment for dementia sufferers. 

Judge Crowson said her behaviour towards the various patients had been 'disgraceful, demeaning and persistent'.

He hoped conditions of her release would prevent her working in the care industry ever again.  

Judge Crowson added he was concerned there are still no guidelines for dealing with those who betray the trust of relatives and abuse vulnerable people in care.

He said to determine his sentence he had to rely on previous cases where care workers had been jailed for abuse - which involved 'short lived' ill-treatment of patients.

Judge Crowson told Ms Koralewski: 'It seems to me your behaviour exceeded any of these cases.'

He added: 'These victims are essentially voiceless.'

The mistreatment came to light after Ms Koralewski's brother, Jeremy, had raised the alarm over the mistreatment at Roundstone Care Home where he worked as a cook.

Judge Crowson told Durham Crown Court: 'He bravely informed against his mother and sister and destroyed his parents' dream of running a care home to do the right thing.'

Ms Koralewski's mother, Margaret, 67, was also accused of the ill-treatment of the four patients but was cleared of all five charges.

During her original trial at Teesside Crown Court, a jury heard how dementia sufferers were mocked, humiliated, and physically abused by Siobhan Koralewski in 2012.

In one case, the court heard she decided to 'take revenge' on Kenneth Pinkney, 88,for striking her 67-year-old mother, Margaret, and breaking her shoulder.

She ripped her top off and danced around him in a vest 'waving her breasts in his face' before hauling him out his chair and biting him between the legs, the jury heard.

Later, Ms Koralewski forced Mr Pinkney in the passenger seat of her car and drove him to Cross Lane Psychiatric Hospital in Scarborough.

She had fastened his seatbelt tight and had the window fully open  so he got cold. Ms Koralewski then kneed him in the back of the legs to force him to walk in front of horrified nurses.

She often forced another dementia sufferer, Elizabeth Hall, 59, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea.

When Ms Hall screamed in protest, Ms Koralewski put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before pulling a 'wedgie' on her to force her to move.

Ms Koralewski then pushed Ms Hall along the floor hard with her foot to the patient's bedroom door.

On another occasion, she stuffed toilet paper she found in her trousers in Ms Hall's mouth to make her shut up.

In another act of ill-treament, Ms Koralewski walked a trembling stroke victim Harold Waller, 91, by using her knee to move him while she held him up.

Ms Koralewski was also seen dragging Joan Normington, 92, out of her chair and 'frogmarching' the patient to her room.

Margaret Koralewski had acquired Roundstone Care Home with her husband Raymond in 2004. Their daughter Siobhan worked there as a senior carer and deputy manager.

In a statement read out in court  by Amanda Marshall, whose father Kenneth Pinkney was ill-treated by Ms Koralewski, she said she only learned about his mistreatment after his funeral.

Ms Marshall told Durham Crown Court: 'The nature of the abuse will stay with me all my life - especially since he was moved into that home to keep him safe and out of danger because they were dementia champions.'

Margaret Koralewski, 67, was cleared of all four charges against her but has cut contact with son 

Another victim statement by Miss Hall's sister, Bessie Grainger, said the decision to place her into care had been 'agonising'.

After learning how her mother was mistreated in Roundstone Care Home, which has since closed, she said she was still tormented by guilt. Ms Hall is now resident in another home.

Ms Grainger said: 'We have struggled to come to terms with what Elizabeth has suffered. The trauma in unimaginable.'

She added: 'I desperately want this to be a nightmare which never happened.'

Siobhan and Margaret had both denied a total of nine charges involving ill-treating the four residents. Siobhan was found guilty on five counts at Teesside Crown Court last month.

Margaret was cleared of all four charges against her and appeared in court on crutches yesterday following a fall to see her daughter sentenced at Durham Crown Court.

There was applause from the victims' families who packed the public gallery as Ms Koralewski was led away. Mrs Grainger shouted 'thank you your lordship'.

Ms Hall's niece, Jan Thompson, 50, said outside the court: 'She is an animal.'

Another niece, Julie Harrison, 57, added: 'Elizabeth was brought up by a loving family and this woman has ruined it all.

'We have been to hell and back.'

Det Sgt Mike Moorhouse, who was involved in the police investigation, said: 'She was a Darth Vader-type character within the home to residents and staff who were not in favour with her.

'She was quite a menacing character. This menacing conduct spilled over into assaults and degrading behaviour towards the residents.

He praised the whistle-blowers - Jeremy and his partner Jennifer Price, who was a care worker.

Det Sgt Moorhouse added: 'It's important to acknowledge their bravery and courage. It was at great cost to themselves personally that they ensured the safety and welfare of the residents.'

Paul Newcome, defending Ms Koralewski, told the court: 'My client worked as a carer for seven years before there was any difficulty.

'During that time we would submit she was completely devoted to the residents and committed many acts of kindness to those residents apart from their daily care.'

In November 2012, police went to the Roundstone Care Home and arrested both Siobhan and Margaret. 

Both denied a total of nine charges over the ill-treatment of patients. Margaret was cleared of all the charges.  

During the seven-day trial in Teesside Crown Court, Siobhan showed no emotion - and continued to chew gum in the dock both before and after the jury found her guilty on five counts.

Det Sgt Mike Moorhouse said after the verdicts: 'The evidence suggests she was a Darth Vader-type character within the home to residents and staff who were not in favour with her.

'She was quite a menacing character. This menacing conduct spilled over into assaults and degrading behaviour towards the residents.'

He praised the whistle-blowers - Siobhan's brother Jeremy, who worked as a cook at the home, and his partner Jennifer Price, who was a care worker.

Both lost their jobs and ended up at loggerheads with the Koralewski family after raising the alarm.

Det Sgt Moorhouse added: 'It's important to acknowledge their bravery and courage. It was at great cost to themselves personally that they ensured the safety and welfare of the residents.'
