A death row inmate sent a letter to a local North Carolina newspaper boasting about the 'life of leisure' he is living while waiting for his execution.

'Is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim?' Danny Robbie Hembree Jr. wrote in a letter from jail.

Hembree, 50, was found guilty of killing a 17-year-old girl in 2009.

He also admitted in a police interrogation to killing two other women, though he now says that he was lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes.

'Is the public aware that I am a gentleman of leisure, watching color TV in the a/c, reading, taking naps at will, eating three well-balanced meals a day?

'I am a man who is ready to except [sic] his unjust punishment and face God Almighty with a clear conscience unlike you cowards and your cowardly system.

'Kill me if you can, suckers. Ha! Ha! Ha!

Hembree was sentenced to death on November 18 for the murder of Heather Catterton and has been waiting in Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.

'I got a call from the father of the 17-year-old that he murdered, in tears,' District Attorney Locke Bell said.

'He said that this is tearing the family to shreds. This is ripping the wound open,' Mr Bell told ABC News.

'I laugh at you self righteous clowns and
I spit in the face of your so called justice system. The state of North
Carolina has sentenced me to death but it's not real,'

'(The father) said, "He murdered our daughter, got the death penalty and now he's just sitting in jail laughing at us!"'

In spite of Hembree's declarations of grandeur, the conditions of Central Prison have been under a microscope in recent months since the prison warden resigned after the despicable treatment of prisoners with mental illnesses.

Alvin Keller stepped down in November- coincidentally the day after Hembree was sentenced- following the results of an investigation that showed mentally ill inmates being left unattended for weeks at a time and found in cells covered with human feces.

The conditions in Hembree's cell seem much more luxurious, however, and he boasted about his free government health care in the letter.

In the November sentencing where Hembree was convicted of murdering a 17-year-old girl, he blew his mother a kiss after being put on death row for the crime

I'm housed in a building that connects to the new 55 million dollar hospital with round the clock free medical care 24/7.'

The gloating letter is not the only one that Hembree sent from prison which is due to be controversial.

He also mailed an inflammatory letter to the NAACP attempting to goad them into fighting for one of his alleged victims, saying that the state’s justice system was playing racial favorites.

In addition to Ms Catterton, Hembree is thought to have killed to other women- Randi Dean Saldana, 30, whose burnt remains were found in South Carolina in 2009 and Deborah Ratchford, 30, whose body found in 1992. Ms Saldana and Ms Catterton, who were friends and both had a history of drug arrests at the time of their death, were white and Ms Ratchford was black.

Hembree wrote to the African-American civil rights group arguing that Mr Bell is trying the cases of the two white women first for racially-motivated reasons.

‘I implore your great organization to pressure Mr. Bell until he gives Debora Ratchford her day in court in the interest of justice,’ Hembree’s letter said.

Both of his letters display a flagrant disregard for the victims families and his lack of remorse.

'I laugh at you self righteous clowns and I spit in the face of your so called justice system. The state of North Carolina has sentenced me to death but it's not real,' he wrote in the letter to the Gaston Gazette.

Central Prison

Central Prison was the first to be built in North Carolina, and was established in December 1884.

It was built by inmates themselves and took 14 years to construct.

Though it originally cost $1.25million to build, construction costs have gone up over the past century, and a major renovation in the 1980s cost $28.8million.

The prison holds 1000 inmates and provides work for the 700 members of staff.

Central Prison serves as the state's main execution chamber and houses all inmates on death row.

On a lighter note, it has Bible study classes, team sports and job assignments within in the prison for 260 prisoners.

Inmates can even take college correspondence courses through the prestigious University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was most recently ranked number 29 in the country.
