When Aaron Eleby saw a defenseless, fluffy puppy while out on patrol in Afghanistan the Special Forces soldier from New York knew he had to save it.

Thanks to a charity helping animals in the war-torn country, and the heroic efforts of Eleby and his fellow servicemen, the seven-month-old puppy is now living in the U.S.

Charity Nowzad was so quick with its part of the rescue mission that the dog, named Yakkul, beat Eleby back home by a week, meaning the pair could celebrate the holidays together.

Rescue mission: Aaron Eleby cuddles puppy Yakkul at his base in Afghanistan

It cost $4,000 to bring the pup back to New York, but the soldier said when he looked the dog in the eyes he had no choice.

'We were at a place and those people 
over there didn't really deserve to have any dogs in the first place,' Elbey told 10 ABC.

'He was literally looking up, like, "What are you going to do man?" ...Â  like "What are you going to do 
next? It's your call",' he said.

After taking the puppy back to base Elbey started raising the funds needed to bring him home.

The soldier had to go away on a two-week mission but by the time he returned, the money had been raised thanks to the help of family, friends and the Steve Caporizzo's Pet Connection website.

The next mission however was to get the puppy safely to Nowzad, which involved a two and half hour drive on dangerous roads.

'He actually had to drive with a 
military escort because you drive around out there by yourself with a 
dog they are going to be like "Why are you doing this?",' Elbey explained.

The charity made the arrangements to fly Yakkul 6,000 miles to JFK airport in New York, where the puppy was met by Elbey's mother, who will look after the dog when her son is away on duty.

But it was another week before he was reunited with the man who saved him.

'When I walked in and saw him, it was awesome. I'm not gonna say a tear came to my eye, but it was hiding back there,' Elbey said.

The puppy has settled into life in the U.S. well, and has made friends with the family's other dog, Naja.

The soldier wrote online, next to a picture of his dogs: 'Took forever to get him home, he beat me back by a week. My parents are doing a great job with him ... and Naja is keeping him in line.'

Yakkul's journey to the U.S. was helped by British animal charity Nowzad, which rescues stray dogs and cats in Afghanistan.

As well as helping soldiers bring stray animals they have bonded with back to their home countries, the charity neuters and vaccinates stray animals and trains local vets.
