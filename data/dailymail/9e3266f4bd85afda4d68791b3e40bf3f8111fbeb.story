Export bar: The work, known as 'Rembrandt Laughing', is said to be a striking example of the Dutch artist's early paintings

An export bar has been placed on a Rembrandt painting in an effort to allow time to raise £16.5million to keep it within Britain.

The work, known as ‘Rembrandt Laughing’, is said to be a striking example of the Dutch artist's early paintings and was one of only a few which he executed on copper plates.

The painting was bought at an auction in May by the Getty Museum of Los Angeles, California.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey deferred the grant of an export licence for the painting until at least October 15 to allow a chance for the money to be raised.

The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest advised the deferral because it was of outstanding aesthetic importance and of significance for the study of Dutch painting, particularly Rembrandt's work in the 1620s.

The picture - known as a ‘tronie’ - may have been a self-portrait but was painted in 1628 to depict an emotion rather than to be a likeness of a particular person.

Most of Rembrandt's paintings in UK collections date to after 1631.

Mr Vaizey said: ‘The UK's galleries may already have an impressive array of Rembrandts, but nothing from this period of this great artist's career.

‘I hope that my deferral of the export licence will allow time for a buyer to come forward and secure this exquisite painting for the nation, where it can be studied and enjoyed by all.’

The deferral period could potentially be extended to April of next year.

The painting was valued at £1,500 in 2007
because it was not believed to be a Rembrandt original, but later sold 
for £2.2million. It was said at the time that the painting was worth up to £20million.

Rembrandt van Rijn is considered to be one of the greatest painters in European art. His works include The Storm on the Sea of Galilee from 1633 and The Abduction of Europa from 1632.
