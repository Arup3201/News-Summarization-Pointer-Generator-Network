It is fondly remembered as the most moving moment in the First World War - a momentary pause from the bloodshed, fighting and senseless deaths. 

And now, the Christmas truce in the trenches has been re-created in a video game for the first time. 

The online game, Verdun, set in the First World War, will give players the chance to stage a Christmas truce by playing football and singing carols instead of the customary shooting.

The online video game, Verdun, gives players the chance to re-create the famous Christmas truce of 1914

Players can take a break from the usual shooting on the First World War game and enjoy the ceasefire

It offers gamers the opportunity to play football with friends online, make fires and throw snowballs

The video 'Celebrate Christmas in Verdun' shows players exchanging Christmas greetings and singing. 

It even offers the opportunity to play football with friends online, simulating the real matches that broke out at Christmas in the trenches, and throw snowballs. 

Fighting will still be possible, as normal, but the developers have created sections of the game that players can go in to and enjoy the brief peace if they wish.

There will be competitions to help keep the event festive — including prizes for the best video of the event or screenshots. 

The Christmas Truce was a series of widespread, unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front in Flanders Fields around Christmas 1914.

On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, many soldiers from both sides independently ventured into no man's land, where they tentatively socialised to host joint burial ceremonies, several meetings and carol-singing.

Troops from both sides were also friendly enough to play games of football with one another, in one of the truce's most enduring images. 

The Christmas truce of 1914 is one of the most enduring images of the bloody First World War 

The game is based on the battle of Verdun in 1916, which was one of the costliest battles of World War One

In the game, players have the chance to enjoy the brief moment of peace amid the bloodshed and fighting 

Verdun is a multi-player game, inspired by the infamous battle of Verdun in 1916, in north-east France. 

Verdun was one of the costliest battles of the First World War and exemplified the 'war of attrition' policy pursued by both sides, which led to an enormous loss of life.

The battle, which lasted from 21 February 1916 until 19 December 1916, led to more than 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). 

The Germans staged the attack in the hope of 'bleeding' the French army to death and then targeting the British alone on the Western Front, which could be brought down by Germany's submarine blockade. 

Although the Germans made initial gains and caught the French unprepared, the French fought back which resulted in a bloody stalemate where neither side could claim victory. 

Away from the gaming world, German and English graffiti artists have come together to create street art murals commemorating the 1914 Christmas truce in Shoreditch, East London.
