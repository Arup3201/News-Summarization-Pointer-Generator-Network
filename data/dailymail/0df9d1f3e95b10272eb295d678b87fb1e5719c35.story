Jose Mourinho has blasted a French media recording of a private conversation in which he appeared to criticise his strikers  a 'disgrace' as he defended his relationship with Samuel Eto'o.

Mourinho, whose comments were broadcast on French TV, said he was joking when he complained about Chelsea's lack of strikers and made an unflattering comment about the age of Eto'o. 

The Chelsea manager insists he was joking and fumed at the ethics of the journalists who recorded his comments.

Job to do: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho speaks with his coaches during training

Ready for battle: Mourinho will lead Chelsea out in the Champions League tie with Galatasaray

Speaking at a press conference ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last-16 clash against Galatasaray, he said: 'There is no story. It 
was a funny conversation with me and someone not from the football 
world. It is a disgrace that someone is taping it when we don’t know.

'I think you
should be embarrassed, as a media professional because from my point of view I
don't think you - not you [here in this room], but a colleague - (should be) able to record a
private conversation and to make it public.'

Mourinho also said Eto'o has no
 reason to be upset about the leaked comments.

He
 joked that Eto’o was probably older than 32 and hinted that an ideal 
solution may be to sign Radamel Falcao because the Colombian deserved a 
bigger audience than he had at Monaco.

'I need a striker, Falcao needs a club,' 
Mourinho is secretly recorded as saying. 'A player like him cannot play 
in front of 3,000 people. Monaco is a club to end (your career with).'

Mourinho
 was caught in conversation with the boss of Swiss watch-makers Hublot, 
explaining that Chelsea did not have anyone to score goals.

The conversation was recorded by French broadcasters Canal+ in 
Switzerland on February 17 and appeared as a video clip on their 
website. It has since been removed but Mourinho’s words had already been
 well circulated, much to the Chelsea manager's embarrassment.

The incident has 
darkened his mood on the eve of a reunion with Didier Drogba, the 
Galatasaray striker and Chelsea legend of the first Mourinho era. Drogba
 left Stamford Bridge in 2012 and the club have yet to replace his 
immense presence.

Nothing to worry about: Mourinho says Samuel Eto'o should not be concerned about the leaked comments

Lack of goals: Mourinho was overheard saying his strikers - Eto'o, Fernando Torres and Demba Ba - couldn't score

Mourinho said he enjoyed his most successful season with the striker when the pair won an unprecedented treble of Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia titles with Inter Milan in 2010, and the Portuguese insisted there was no issue between the pair.

He said: 'Samuel Eto’o is Samuel Eto’o, he is four times a 
Champions League winner, people think three but it is four. Once with 
Real Madrid, twice with Barcelona and once with Inter.

'It is with
 him I had the best season of my career. He is one of few players to 
work with me at a second club. He has no reason to be upset.

'Also he told a few years ago that, "Mourinho is the only manager in the world I would never play for". After a few years he was playing with me at Inter and now he is playing for me.

'There is no story.'

Threat: Didier Drogba will pose problems for former club Chelsea when he lines up for Galatasaray

Friends reunited: Mourinho says it will be strange going up against Drogba - but he has to forget about it

On his reunion with former Chelsea striker Drogba, Mourinho says he will try to put his feelings for the striker to one side during the game.

He added: 'I look forward to every match. I like to play. I’m happy to do it. I like to do it against the best and Galatasaray is the Turkish champions.

'Drogba, I know is difficult and it’s a strange feeling. I have to admit that. We have to do our job. I know he wants to do his job. It’s a strange feeling we have to try to forget during the game.

'Even during the game sometimes you look at players who belong to my life like Didier and (Wesley) Sneijder, and I have to play against them and it’s not the same.

'I played Chelsea once and the feeling not the same but you have to do your job. You want to win. That’s the basic principle of football. You have to forget or at least try to forget.'
