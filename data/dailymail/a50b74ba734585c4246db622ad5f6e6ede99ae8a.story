Actor James Woods took to Twitter on Sunday to blame the Rev. Al Sharpton, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Obama for being ‘responsible’ for the murder of two NYPD officers on Saturday.

Sharpton came in for the worst of Woods’ abuse, with the former Academy Award nominee calling him a ‘race pimp’ and a ‘disgusting pig’.

At one point on Sunday morning Woods’ tweeted: ‘This disgusting pig is DIRECTLY responsible for the murder of two good policemen. No discussion’.

The tweet included a photo of Sharpton at a protest against police.

Woods later took down that post, reports Daily Caller, but he continued tweeting using a series of hashtags including '#PigSharpton', '#RaceHucksters', '#TurnYourBack', '#BlueLivesMatter' 

Woods, 67, even called for a boycott of Sony Entertainment - after executives from the company recently promised to work with Sharpton after leaked emails featured racist comments.

The president also came in for criticism including a tweet that featured a photo of Sharpton and Obama and the text ‘mission accomplished’.

Woods also applauded  the NYPD officers who turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio during his press conference following Saturday's shootings.

This isn’t the first time Woods has used Twitter to express his political views.

Last year he called President Obama ‘a true abomination’ and then tweeted that he didn’t think he would work again because of his opinions.

'I don’t expect to work again. I think Barack Obama is a threat to the integrity and future of the Republic. My country first,' he wrote in response. 

The Rev. Al Sharpton said Eric Garner's family has no connection to a man who murdered two New York City cops in an apparent retribution killing as he revealed at a Sunday press conference threats made on his life in racist profanity-laced voicemail.

He also said there is no place for angry rhetoric that blames protesters or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

'We are now under intense threat from those who are misguided,' he said. 'From those who are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight.'

In one tweet, Woods accused Sharpton of being 'DIRECTLY responsible for the murder of two good policemen. No discussion’, although he later deleted it

Sharpton told The Associated Press that he's considering tightening his personal security after receiving nine messages threatening him — all within hours of the shooting.

He then clicked on his cellphone and played one message in which the male caller used the N-word to address the preacher, followed by a stream of four-letter words used to describe protest actions Sharpton has led against police-involved deaths of unarmed blacks.

'The language is "Hey N word, stop killing innocent people, I'm going to get you," and I have several like this,' he said, according to silive.com. 'We are now under intense threat from those that are misguided, by those that are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight.' 

Sharpton continued: 'There are those of us committed to nonviolence and making the system work. 

'And there are those committed to anarchy and recklessness who could care less about the families of police or the families who have raised questions about police accountability.'

He was joined at the National Action Network by the wife and mother or Eric Garner, who both advocated non-violence.

Brown's family condemned the shooting in a statement posted online by their attorney.

'We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,' the family said.

Garner, who was black, died after he was taken down by a white officer during an arrest on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes. The 18-year-old Brown, who was black, was fatally shot by a white officer. He was unarmed.

Most of the protests have been peaceful, particularly in New York. Bratton said police were investigating whether Brinsley had attended any rallies or demonstrations and why he had chosen to kill the officers.

De Blasio said the killings of Ramos and Liu strike at the heart of the city.

'Our city is in mourning. Our hearts are heavy,' said de Blasio, who spoke softly with moist eyes. 'It is an attack on all of us.'

Scores of officers in uniform lined up three rows deep at the hospital driveway. The line stretched into the street. Officers raised their hands in a silent salute as two ambulances bore away the slain officers' bodies. The mayor ordered flags at half-staff.

In a statement Saturday night, Attorney General Eric Holder condemned the shooting deaths as senseless and 'an unspeakable act of barbarism.' Obama, vacationing in Hawaii, issued a statement saying he unconditionally condemns the slayings.

'The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day — and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day,' Obama said. 'Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal — prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.'

The shootings ended a bizarre route for Brinsley that began in Maryland early Saturday. He went to the home of a former girlfriend in a Baltimore suburb and shot and wounded her. Police there said they noticed Brinsley posting from the woman's Instagram account threats to kill New York officers.

Baltimore-area officials sent a warning to New York City police, who received it moments too late, Bratton said.

Officers pursued Brinsley after the shooting to a nearby subway station, where he shot himself in the head as a subway train door full of people closed. A silver handgun was recovered at the scene, Bratton said.
