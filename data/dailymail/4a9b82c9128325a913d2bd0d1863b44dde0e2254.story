Fish lovers are facing a big leap in the price of salmon, according to a report yesterday.

Prices have rocketed by 56 per cent in the past year.

Salmon supplies have become more scare because of bad weather.

Pricey: A shortage of salmon has made it an expensive treat over the past year

Trade magazine The Grocer said 
yesterday: 'Bad news for fish fans – one of the UK’s most popular 
species - salmon - is currently experiencing sharp price increases.'

The report says that cold weather in Norway has caused salmon growth rates to slow down, thus reducing production and pushing prices up higher.

At £4,745 a tonne, farmed Norwegian salmon is now 56.1per cent more expensive than this time last year and up by 4.5per cent month on month, says The Grocer.

Salmon prices are being supported further by rising fishmeal prices, which has hit commercial producers and then consumers in turn.

This has pushed up production costs on fish farms.

The Grocer said that the picture also
remains challenging for coldwater prawns, with prices rising because 
global supply has tightened.

The
total allowable catch for coldwater prawns this year is 90.000 tonnes 
smaller than in 2012.

This caused prices to increase by 36.6per cent 
year-on-year.

But the 
magazine says that prices have eased on a month-on-month basis as a 
result of improving supplies in May and high prices curtailing demand.
