Once famous for their stiff upper lip, Britons have succumbed to an epidemic of ‘oversharing’ thanks to a steady diet of X Factor sob stories and revealing Facebook posts.

A survey of 1,000 adults shows that the natural British reserve has been eroded when it comes to talking about previously taboo subjects such as sex.

Growing numbers are prepared to spill the beans on personal issues in a way that would have horrified previous generations. The study revealed that one in four people think Britain is a nation of oversharers.

Blame Jeremy: Confessional television chat shows such as The Jeremy Kyle Show are to blame for Brits now sharing more than their parents' generation

Many have been influenced by seeing celebrities openly discuss their addictions or depression, confessional television such as The Jeremy Kyle Show or back stories on talent shows.

More than half (51 per cent) say they are more likely to talk about the topic they rated the most blush-inducing of all - sex - than their parents would have been at the same age.

But even six in ten (57 per cent) of today’s over 60s, many of whom grew up in the liberated sixties, are more open to talking about sex than previous generations.

More than one in three (38 per cent) Brits are more open to discussing personal health problems than their parents were when young.

Seeing celebrities such as Cheryl Cole open up about their emotional issues or troubled pasts have also led to 'oversharing'

Yet it is money which remains one of the most awkward areas of discussion for many, with many unwilling to tell others how much they earn, for instance.

Only 29 per cent felt they are more likely to raise the subject than an older generation.

A spokesman for laundry brand Surcare, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘As increasing numbers of people turn to social media to chat to friends and share their innermost thoughts in the public domain, it’s no surprise that a quarter of people feel we are now so comfortable tackling sensitive subjects that we have actually become a nation of oversharers.

‘Reality TV reinforces the idea that there’s something to gain from sharing sensitive information about yourself.

‘And social media is making it easier than ever for people to do so without having to deal with the embarrassment of a face to face conversation.’
