The remote volcanic islands of the Galapagos archipelago - home to the world's largest tortoises and the place that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution - is coming to Google's Street View later this year. 

Google, in partnership with Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate (GNPD), sent hikers to the Galapagos Islands with Street View Trekker equipment to take panoramic images of its wildlife.

The hikers captured thousands of images using the football-like cameras mounted on a tower on top of the 42lb (19kg) computer backpacks.

Googler Karin Tuxen-Bettman is seen in the background taking photos using the Street View Trekker orb camera attached to a backpack. The volcanic islands of the Galapagos archipelago are closed to tourists but Google recently sent its Street View and underwater cameras to the region and is putting the images online later this year

As well as taking land images with its Trekker backpack cameras, Google also took underwater cameras to the Galapagos Islands to record life on the seabed.

The Galapagos Islands, also known as the Archipielago de Colon and Islas de Colón are an archipelago of volcanic islands found on either side of the Equator in the Pacific Ocean.

Archipelago means group of islands or island chain.

The Galapagos islands are 500 miles west of Ecuador.

They are famous for their giant tortosies and blue-footed booby birds. 

The first chart of the islands was said to be made by the buccaneer 
Ambrose Cowley in 1684.

The first detailed studies of the islands were made by Charles Darwin while aboard HMS Beagle during the 1830s.

He used the animals and landscapes he saw to help develop his theory of evolution. 

They also used underwater Street View cameras to capture sea life as part of the Catlin Seaview Survey.

Google is now stitching these images together and all of the panoramic images will be 
available on Google Maps later this year so people around the world can 
experience this remote archipelago.

Few have explored the remote volcanic
islands of the Galapagos archipelago because it is closed to tourists.

Google was allowed on the islands with its backpack Trekker orb cameras to fully document the archipelago in pictures.

Each Trekker orb has 15 cameras inside it that have captured panoramic views of some of the most inaccessible places on the Galapagos.

Crews from The Catlin Seaview Survey worked with Google to capture 360-degree views of selected underwater areas too.

Raleigh Seamster, the project's leader for Google Maps said: 'We spent 10 days there hiking over trails and even down the crater of an active volcano.' 

'And these are islands, so half of the life there is under the water surface.

We brought Street View underwater to swim with sea lions, sharks and other marine animals.'

Google is processing the footage and is trying to stitch it together.

It hopes to post it to Street View later this year.

Daniel Orellana of the Charles Darwin Foundation collects seashore imagery with the Street View Trekker at the Los Humedales wetland area on Isabela Island in the Galapagos. The orbs attached to the Trekker backpacks have 15 cameras inside that can take panoramic photos. The backpack weighs 42lb (19kg)

The Street View Trekker backpacks, took more than a year
to develop.

The
40lb backpack holds up a number of 15-megapixel cameras, an on-board 
hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day.

Cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured.

The cameras captured the nesting sites of blue-footed boobies, the red-throated 'magnificent frigatebirds,' swimming hammerhead sharks and, of course, the island's giant tortoises.

Scientists working with Google are 
exploring the footage for other species and hope to update the pictures 
regularly throughout the years as they study the effects of invasive 
species, tourism and climate change on the island's ecosystems. 

'We
hope that children in classrooms around the world will be trying to 
discover what they can see in the images, even tiny creatures like 
insects,' said Daniel Orellana, a scientist with the Charles Darwin 
Foundation.

'We can use this as an education experience for children, and there is a huge opportunity for rare discoveries.'

The lava landscapes found on the island help tell the story of the formation of the Galapagos. Tourists are banned from the islands and the images taken by Google, due to go online later this year, will give people worldwide a unique view and unseen places

Orellana and others supervised the Google trekkers and helped guide them to remote areas either off-limits to tourists or rarely visited because they are hard to reach. 

They also captured images of the areas frequented by tourists so they can keep track of how this access is affecting the environment. 

Since launching Street View in 2007, Google has expanded from urban neighborhoods accessed easily by its mapping cars to more hard-to-access sites like the ocean floor, the Amazon rain forest and the Arctic. 

'This whole project was part of Google's ongoing effort to build the most comprehensive and accurate map of the world,' Seamster said. 

Daniel Orellana is shown crossing a field of ferns to reach some naturally occurring sulfur mines on the top of Sierra Negra, an active volcano on Isabela Island in the Galapagos. The Google Maps team traveled for over hours, hiking and on horseback, to reach this remote location
