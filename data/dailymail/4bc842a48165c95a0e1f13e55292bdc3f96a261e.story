A series of emails  leaked by journalists at Al Jazeera English reveal a divide among staff regarding the news organisation's coverage of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

In the exchange, some staff members brand the satirical magazine as 'racist' and 'extremist,' over the publication of controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

While others defended Charlie Hebdo's decision, saying that it needed to be done to ensure that the 'violent' do not have control over 'liberal civilization'.

'Alienating': One of the emails urged staff to discuss the potentially divisive 'Je suis Charlie' slogan. The phrase has been used to unite those standing in solidarity with the victims. Above, rally in Clermont-Ferrand

The publication of the exchange comes as the first pictures of three of the four hostages killed in yesterday's kosher supermarket siege in Paris have emerged. 

Meanwhile, there are reports that the wife of the Paris supermarket gunman - named France's most wanted woman - may already be in Syria.

In an email sent out to staff on Thursday, London-based editor and executive producer Salah-Aldeen Khadr, suggests a list of questions that should guide the channel's coverage of the attack.

He starts by explaining that the email is intended to ensure that the channel's 'coverage is the best it can be', according to the National Review, who has published the emails in full. 

Khadr urged his employees to question if the terrorist attack was 'really an attack on free speech,' asking whether an 'attack by 2-3 guys' on 'a controversial magazine' was equal to a 'civilizational attack on European values'. 

He goes on to ask staff members to discuss whether 'I am Charlie' - a slogan used to unite those standing in solidarity with the terror victims - was 'alienating', creating an 'us and them' mentality. 

'Extremist': London-based editor and executive producer Salah-Aldeen Khadr suggests framing the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, pictured above, as a 'clash of extremist fringes'

Khadr explains that people can be 'against CH [Charlie Hebdo] racism and also against murdering people'. 

Finally, he states that the massacre should be viewed as 'a clash of extremist fringes', apparently referring to the Islamic fundamentalists on one side and the team at Charlie Hebdo on the other. 

The email sparked a heated debate among its recipients. 

Just hours after it was sent, U.S.-based correspondent Tom Ackerman responded by quoting an excerpt of a New York Times article by Ross Douthat.

It read: 'If a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something, then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization.'

This prompted a response from Qatar-based Mohamed Vall Salem, who reported for Al Jazeera's Arab-language channel before joining its English wing in 2006.

He said that 'what Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech', adding that 'it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion'. 

He urged colleagues to take another look at the cartoons, explaining it was not 'what they said' but 'how they said it'.

Ending his email, he wrote: 'I condemn those heinous killings, but I'M NOT CHARLIE'.

Senior Paris correspondent Jacky Rowland wrote a simple response to her colleagues, saying '#journalismisnotacrime.' 

The exchange concludes with a response from Roving reporter Omar Al Saleh: 'First I condemn the brutal killing. But I AM NOT CHARLIE.'

'Journalism is not a crime... insultism is not journalism.. and not doing journalism properly is crime.'

A spokesman from Al Jazeera told MailOnline: 'We have arguably the most diverse newsroom in the world, and the robustness of our internal discussions that flow from this are a great strength. 

'Viewers judge us on our actual output - on the horrific story in Paris our coverage has been first class, relaying events in real time, all the while providing expert context and analysis from across the spectrum.'
