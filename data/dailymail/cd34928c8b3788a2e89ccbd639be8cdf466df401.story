Billionaire Texas fund manager Fayez Sarofim - one of the richest men in America with a net worth of $2 billion - has furrowed some brows among Houston's wealthy social set after reportedly proposing to his son's mother-in-law.

The 85-year-old father-of-five - born into Egyptian royalty and co-owner of the Houston Texans - proposed over the weekend to glamorous businesswoman Susan Krohn, according to CultureMap Houston.

It was only in May that Sarofim's son, Phillip, 27, married Krohn's 33-year-old daughter Lori in Hawaii.

However once their parents are married, they will be considered step-siblings.
