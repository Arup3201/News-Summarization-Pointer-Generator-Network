A graduate from Washington has designed a simple yet revolutionary camera lens that can be fitted to a smartphone camera and used to zoom to microscopic levels.

The six millimetre Micro Phone Lens has a magnifying range of between 15x and 60x - by comparison a high-end smartphone camera comes with around 10x zoom.

It is made of silicone that is capable of sticking to a smartphone camera lens without any extra adhesive and costs just $15 (£9).

A Washington graduate has invented a six millimetre lens, pictured, that can be fitted directly onto a smartphone camera and is capable of magnifying objects up to 60x. The Micro Phone Lens has a basic 15x zoom and will cost £9 plus shipping when it goes on sale in late September

Base magnification: 15x

Maximum magnification: 60x with phone zoom

Minimum recommended camera: 5 Megapixels 

Product diameter: 1/4'" (6 mm)

Material: Platinum catalysed silicone

Optically identical to glass

Soft lens that can't be scratched

Self-adheres to almost any mobile phone or tablet camera

Reusable and can be washed with soap and water 

All photos taken can be edited and shared in the same way as normal photos using the phone's built-in gallery and editor.

The Micro Phone Lens was created by 22-year-old Thomas Larson from Seattle after he began working on the idea while studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.  

Larson set up a Kickstarter project to raise funding for the project in August and has already raised more than $68,000 
(£44,000) before the campaign ends on 10 September.

The lenses are made of a patent pending technology called platinum catalysed silicone.

It is a sticky material that can be washed using soap and water, without damaging its adhesive qualities.

Larson claims that because the lens is classed as soft - meaning it is flexible - it can't be scratched like traditional glass lenses and is 'optically identical to glass'.

This means it has the same transparency as glass and can also bend and view light in a similar way.

Future versions of the lens could reveal the intricate details of an insect wing (insect not specified) - a user can easily see the fragile structure and mottled texture of the body part

Larson's Kickstarter campaign is for funding of a 15x version of the lens but Larson is also working on a 150X version that would produce sharper images, such as these microscopic views of an onion, left, and pollen, right

Here a piece of fabric looks as if it is covered in thick multicoloured wires, but in fact the 'barbs' are very soft fibres that have been magnified 150x by a future version of Larson's Micro Photo Lens

He adds that, in theory, the lens should stay sticky 'forever'.

On his Kickstarter page, Larson said he: 'believes, a cheap and portable microscope of this kind 
could not only be used for entertaining purposes, but also provide 
possibilities for health and disease prevention in the developing world.'

Although Larson claims the Micro Phone Lens works with most major smartphones and camera, he recommends it is used with a camera that has 5MP or higher for the best results. Here a smiley face is displayed next to a coin to show its size before it is magnified

With the detachable lens the smiley face suddenly becomes much bigger and every minute detail of the pen mark and the texture of the paper can be seen

Although Larson claims the Micro Phone Lens works with most major smartphones and camera, he recommends it is used with a camera that has 5MP or higher for the best results.

He also warns that the lens might not fit with phones that have 'funky geometry' but does not list any examples. 

The Kickstarter campaign is for funding of a 15x version but Larson is working on ways to mass produce a higher magnification models.

'Further down the road, I intend to make a 150X version of the lens 
available,' said Larson.

'Having a cheap and portable microscope would have huge 
implications for health and disease prevention in the developing world.'
