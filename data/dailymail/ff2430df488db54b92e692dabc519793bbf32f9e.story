Tragic: Joni Brace, 33, fell to his death after having a cigarette out his bedroom window

A smoker was killed when he fell out of his bedroom window while having a late-night cigarette, an inquest has heard.

Young software engineer Jonathan Brace, 33, died after he fell 20ft to his death, hitting his head on the patio below.

Brace was forbidden from smoking within the Newport home he shared with his mother, and would instead lean out of his bedroom window to avoid fumes circulating the house.

As part of a money-saving drive he had stopped going out, preferring to drink and smoke at home in his room while playing Xbox games.

The young professional had been hoping to save up enough money for a trip to Australia to see his brother.

Heartbroken Mrs Brace, 61, who tragically discovered her son the next morning, said: 'I shouted up to Joni in the morning but I got no response. I walked into his room and I could see he wasn't [there] but that the window was open.

'My worst fears were realised.'

Mrs Brace also told the inquest that she repeatedly warned her son to stop smoking while sitting on his window ledge.

Pathologist Nicholas Dallimore revealed that he had suffered severe head injuries and would have died almost instantly.

The post mortem report found he was 
almost twice the legal drink drive limit. The inquest recorded a verdict
 of accidental death.
