Scientists have discovered a brand new species of dinosaur with a nose so big it's right there in its name.

Rhinorex condrupus, or 'King Nose,' was discovered in Utah back in the 1990s, but scientists never pieced its skull together.

The skull was stored and forgotten at Brigham Young University until recently, when researchers from North Carolina State and Brigham Young Museum of Paleontology put it together and realized its something brand new.

Meet 'Nose King': Scientists have newly classified a species of dinosaur that had one of the largest nose-to-body rations in the history of dinos

The 75 million-year-old herbivore's bones were encased in sandstone in the Upper Cretaceous in the Neslen formation in Utah's Book Cliffs.

It's the first dinosaur of the hadrosaur type--duck-billed dinos more often known for their large head ornaments than super schnozes,  ever found in the area.

'We’ve found other hadrosaurs from the same time period but located about 200 miles farther south that are adapted to a different environment,' researcher Terry Gates from North Carolina State University told Live Science.

Weighing in at a massive 8,500 pounds and measuring around 30 feet long, the swamp-dwelling beast had one of the biggest body-to-nose ratios of any dinosaur yet discovered.

So what was the nose used for? Scientists have no idea.

'The purpose of such a big nose is still a mystery,' Gates said. 'We are already sniffing out answers to these questions.'

However, scientists do have a hunch about what brought the beast to its watery end--a giant crocodile.

'It seemed like a great possibility that such an attack could have caused the rapid death of a large dinosaur and helped it to be buried quickly by taking it to the bottom of a river,' Gates said.

Schnozzy: Rhinorex condrupus {'nose king') was an 8,500 pound herbivore that lived in the swamps of northern Utah. Scientists actually discovered it in the 1990s, but didn't piece the schnozzy skull together until recently
