A Minnesota zoo is welcoming the arrival of its first lowland gorilla baby.

The male primate was born Wednesday morning at Como Zoo in St. Paul weighing a healthy 4lbs.

Video footage shows the infant being lovingly cradled in the hands of his mother, 12-year-old Alice, in an off-exhibit area.

The first-time mother appears to be exhausted as she  lays restless on the ground.

The infant, who has not yet been named, is the first of his kind to be born at the zoo in its 55-year history of gorilla care and conservation.

Keepers say the baby seems to be 'strong' and is already forming a bond with his mother.

A gorilla mother is very protective of her babies and will carry them on her chest for the first three months. 

The infant will then move to ride on its mother's back at around six months old and begin playing on the ground close by.

Commenting on this pattern of behavior, Jo Kelly, Como Zoo's senior zookeeper, said: 'Gorillas are very family oriented.

'Mom will let other family members see the baby and they will take their cues from mom as to how close they can be.' 

A gorilla gestation is approximately eight months.

Alice’s housemate, 11-year-old Dara, is expecting and likely to give birth in December or January.

In both cases, the father is Schroeder, 29, who has lived at Como since 1991. 

Gorillas can live up to 40 years in the wild and 50 years in captivity.
