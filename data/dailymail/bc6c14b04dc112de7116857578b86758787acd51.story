A dog owner allowed one of his Jack Russell's to starve to death with another forced to eat its remains after leaving the pair without food for a month.

Shane Maurice Potts, 29, left the animals unattended after moving with his children to stay at his mother’s home.

The dogs were left in appalling conditions and although there was a bag of dog biscuits on a worktop - it was just out of their reach.

A female called ‘Nala’, eventually starved to death while the other, a male called ‘Simba’, stayed alive by eating her remains,

Appearing at Buxton Magistrates Court yesterday, Potts, from High Peak, Derbyshire, admitted two animal cruelty charges.

The dogs were discovered by RSPCA inspector Lorna Campbell after a call from a concerned member of the public.

She said: 'When I saw Simba at the window it was obvious he was emaciated and when I looked in I saw what I thought was a toy he’d chewed up.

'It took a moment before I realised the full horror of what it actually was, the remains of Nala. It was devastating.'

The RSPCA had offered advice to Potts in July 2011, given him neutering vouchers and re-homed a third dog which he had at that time but had no complaints since.

The court heard that Potts and his children had moved into his mother’s house in Chapel-en-le-Frith.

He hadn’t been back to his own property for more than four weeks.

RSPCA Inspector Campbell said: 'That Simba survived is a miracle. When police gained access he raced past us to a bowl of dirty water in the garden with cigarette butts in it and tried to drink from it.

'The conditions in the house were terrible. The place was covered in faeces and the floor was slippery with urine.

'There was a shredded dog food bag on the floor, an empty tub of gravy granules and chewed towels and of course what was left of his companion.

'Tragically, there was a bag of dog biscuits on the worktop which it looked as though the dogs had been trying to reach but it was just too high.'

Potts’ solicitor told the court he was finding it difficult to manage his responsibilities and had moved in with his mother to help.

He’s due to appear at Buxton Magistrates Court on August 21 for sentencing.

After being signed over to the RSPCA, Simba has recovered and has been happily re-homed.
