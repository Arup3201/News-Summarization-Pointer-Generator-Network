House Speaker John Boehner has stuck an Internet sales tax proposal in a drawer and he doesn't intend to dust it off before the end of the Christmas shopping season – if he considers it at all.

The Marketplace Fairness Act, passed last year in the Senate, would allow each state to force out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes from its residents.

But a Boehner spokesman said late Monday in a statement that the plan isn't going anywhere.

SHOPPING FREEDOM? House Speaker John Boehner wants online purchases to be tax-free so retailers – including small Internet businesses – won't have to do paperwork for all 45 states that collect sales taxes

'The speaker has made clear in the past he has significant concerns about the bill, and it won’t move forward this year,” said spokesman Kevin Smith. 

'The Judiciary Committee continues to examine the measure and the broader issue. In the meantime, the House and Senate should work together to extend the moratorium on Internet taxation without further delay.'

The committee, chaired by Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, has sat on the Marketplace Fairness Act since early in 2013.

A congressional aide told MailOnline that Goodlatte fears forcing Internet stores to collect sales taxes could create new tax-compliance nightmares.

They would have to manage the requirements of all 45 states that collect sales taxes, the staffer explained, while traditional stores with no more than a few locations only need to worry about one.

That wouldn't be a problem for a shoe store like Zappos, but it could be a paperwork headache for every small business that has an online presence.

The National Retail Federation, a trade group, is backing brick-and-mortar shops that want to see Internet sales taxes everywhere since their walk-in customers have to pay the taxes on everything they buy.

'The bill may change or even be folded into another piece of "must-pass" legislation. NRF communications director Stephen Schatz tweeted Monday. 'The fight is far from over.'

'We have about three weeks in the lame duck. Anything can happen. Retailers are all in to get this done this year.'

The Obama administration backed the proposal when the Senate bill made national news.

'We believe that the Marketplace Fairness Act will level the playing field for local small business retailers who are undercut every day by out-of state online companies,' the White House's then-press secretary Jay Carney told reporters in April 2013.

'Today, while local small business retailers follow the law and collect sales taxes from customers who make purchases in their stores, many big business online and catalogue retailers do not collect the same taxes. This puts local neighborhood-based small businesses at a disadvantage to big, out-of-state, online companies.' 

Big money: State legislators hope new laws will help recapture tax revenue lost when consumers makes billions in purchases each year from sites like Amazon

But Grover Norquist, the famously anti-tax president of Americans for Tax Reform, lashed out at the idea.

'Too many politicians in state capitols and Washington have looked at the internet only as a way to raise taxes,' he told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'They want to tax Internet access, they want to raise Internet sales.'

'Boehner has drawn a line in the sand saying the American people come first and politicians need to keep their hands off the Internet. ... Obama says yes to taxing the Internet, Reid says yes to taxing the Internet. Speaker Boehner just said "hell no" to taxing the Internet. Boehner wins.'

One odd development will strike the states of Virginia and Maryland if the Marketplace Fairness Act doesn't become law, according to Roll Call.

Transportation funding calculations in both of those states will change unless they can start collecting sales tax from their residents who buy things across state lines.

The net results will be higher gas taxes beginning in January, meaning that the Old Dominion and the 'Free State' – Maryland – will get their money either way.

Amazon already collects sales tax from residents of 23 states and wants the bill passed so it can establish its own 'level playing field' with other online giants like eBay and Overstock.

Both of those companies oppose the legislation.
