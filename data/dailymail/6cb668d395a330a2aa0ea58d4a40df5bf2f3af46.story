Jose Mourinho watched his Chelsea team mercilessly sweep aside Tottenham at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, but the three points may take their toll on his team.

As the Premier League leaders travel Newcastle on Saturday looking to maintain their unbeaten start to the seaon, Nemanja Matic and possibly Gary Cahill could be missing.

Cahill has formed a stern partnership in the centre of Chelsea's defence with John Terry but was taken off at the half time interval against Tottenham after a nasty clash of heads with Jan Vertonghen.

Nemanja Matic has stood out all season for Chelsea and will be missed when they play Newcastle

Furthermore, Nemanja Matic received his fifth yellow card of the season for pulling the shirt of Tottenham forward Harry Kane.

Matic has been earning rave reviews for his defensive midfield role at Chelsea and was formidable again as Tottenham were beaten.

As Chelsea look to take their fearsome start to the season into December's Christmas fixtures, they will be aware that the last time they visited Newcastle, they sank to a 2-0 defeat.
