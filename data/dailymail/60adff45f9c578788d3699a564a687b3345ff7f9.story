Labour will support an amendment tabled by bishops in the House of Lords which threatens to derail the Government's plans to introduce a £26,000 annual cap on benefits, the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions has said.

Liam Byrne told the Commons that if his party's 'safeguards' on homelessness were not accepted, Labour peers would vote against the Government in a crucial vote on amendments to its flagship Welfare Reform Bill.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith's measures would see a £26,000-a-year benefit cap, the equivalent of £35,000 before tax.

David Cameron taking part in 'PM Direct' question and answer session today with workers at the Asda head office. On the issue of the benefits cap he said: 'It's a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone?

However, a combination of Church of 
England bishops and rebel Liberal Democrats are threatening to derail 
the planned £500-a-week cap when peers vote on the measure today.

Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown 
became the most high-profile figure so far to speak out against the 
plans, denouncing them as 'completely unacceptable' in their current 
form.

party's 'safeguards' on homelessness were not accepted, Labour peers 
would vote against the Govt in a crucial vote on amendments to its
flagship Welfare Reform Bill. Iain Duncan Smith (right) has described it as a 'wrecking' amendment

In a heated exchange with Mr Byrne, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'If he says he's in favour of the cap, then why do his side keep on voting against it and today in the other place they have laid an amendment which is officially a wrecking amendment on the cap, so they cannot weasel their way out of it and say they are in favour on the one hand and against on the other.

'And I remind him, when it comes to housing benefit, under his side housing benefit pretty near doubled in ten years and it was set to rise far more than it'll rise under us.'

Mr Byrne said the housing benefit bill was set to rise by 'an extraordinary' £4billion over the course of four years.

He said: 'Now what we do not want on top of that is another bill for council tax payers to clean up the cost of homelessness.

The issue began to trend on Twitter this morning with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at £26,000

'Now the Secretary of State for DCLG 
has already warned us that 20,000 people will be made homeless as a 
result of the way his cap will be introduced.

'This
morning his own department published an impact assessment that put up 
the number of families affected by the cap by a third. It's almost as if
he's making this policy up as he goes along.

'So
I hope he will accept Labour's safeguards this afternoon that guard 
against a new risk of homelessness. If he dismisses it, if he wants to 
be so glib about it why doesn't he accept the amendment this afternoon, 
because if he doesn't we will support the Lord Bishops' amendment to 
safeguard against a new bill for council tax payers.'

Do you think £26,000-a-year benefits cap is fair?

Mr Duncan Smith said he did not 
accept the Bishops' amendment, adding: 'Of course it would raise roughly
the level that we would see on the level of income to about £50,000. It
would be rather pointless having a cap set so high that nobody could 
ever earn it.'

He
stated he had an email from a vicar stating he was wondering why the 
Bishops 'had failed to recognise that he as a vicar is only paid at 
£22,000 a year and wonders why they are getting excited about £26,000 
being a poverty level figure'.

Referring to housing benefit, he said the Government was saving £2billion a year and it doubled under Labour.

Lib
Dem Sir Alan Beith (Berwick-Upon-Tweed) said many of his constituents 
'object strongly to paying through their taxes for people to get more in
benefits than they can get on a working wage or to live in properties 
which are far beyond anything they could afford on their wage'.

 DAVID CAMERON: 'It's a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? I don't believe they should'

He added it was important to get the transition right, but the principles were sound.

Mr
Duncan Smith replied: 'Absolutely, the principle behind this, the 
application of it, is vital and I simply cannot understand why the party
opposite snigger and wriggle on this issue, failing to do what is 
right, failing to do what is proper and facing up to their 
responsibility.'

Mr Duncan Smith hit out Labour's position on the benefit cap proposals, stating it had 'taken more different positions than a Jane Fonda workout'.

Tory Margot James (Stourbridge) said average earnings in her constituency were £23,700 a year, arguing that 'to oppose or to equivocate on the policy on a cap on benefits is an outrageous insult to all hard working people in this country'.

Mr Duncan Smith replied that she was 'absolutely right', adding that 'this cap is fair and it is popular'. The welfare system they inherited 'is in a mess and trapping people in dependency when we could free them'.

Speaking as Mr Byrne listened, he said the Opposition's position on the issue was ill conceived, adding: 'The right honourable gentleman on this has taken more different positions than a Jane Fonda workout.'

Earlier, David Cameron said: 'It's a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone?

'I don't believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view."

Speaking in Leeds Mr Cameron said the £35,000 equivalent wage was a 'good, healthy salary'.

As ministers faced a concerted challenge to their welfare reforms, Opposition spokesman Lord McKenzie of Luton said his party backed the cap but it had to be 'based on fairness"'.

In report stage debate on the Welfare Reform Bill, he told peers: 'A particular concern for us is its potential to drive increased homelessness.'

Labour, with the backing of Church of England bishops, want the Government to exempt from the cap those threatened with homelessness because of its introduction.

But Work and Pensions minister Lord Freud defended the cap, insisting households should not be able to receive more in benefits than the average family earned from work.

'People on benefits should face the same choices as working families, including where they can afford to live,' he said.

The cap was welcomed by the Centre for Social Justice think tank, which was founded by Mr Duncan Smith in opposition.

Executive director Gavin Poole said: 'Members of the House of Lords should think twice about opposing a reform that will help tackle child poverty in the UK.

'Our present system traps families in dependency on state handouts and sends a corrosive message to the two million children who live in workless households.

'Deprived of the role model of a parent who goes out to work and earns a living, many of these children will simply repeat this stultifying, destructive cycle, graduating to an adult life on benefits.

'By capping benefits at the level of average income and by restoring the incentive to work, ministers are taking a major step towards ending intergenerational poverty and giving young people the chance to make something of their lives.
