A paramedic has been suspended after he was seen inhaling laughing gas while on duty and driving a Vauxhall Vectra emergency vehicle.

Nigel Moore, who had worked for the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust for 26 years, was seen with one hand on the Entonox laughing gas and the other on the steering wheel.

He was unsteady on his feet, had slurred speech and appeared intoxicated after he got out of the Vectra, a disciplinary hearing was told.

The gas contains 50 per cent oxygen and 50 per cent nitrus oxide and is administered for pain relief.

Nigel Moore, who had worked for the ambulance service for 26 years, was seen with one hand on the laughing gas and the other on the steering wheel.

A report by the Health Professionals 
Council Conduct and Competence Committee said: 'As the registrant left 
the ambulance station, in a Vauxhall Vectra East Midlands Ambulance 
Service (EMAS) Fast Response Vehicle, he was observed holding an Entonox
demand valve in his mouth with one hand, and the other on the steering 
wheel.'

As a team leader he was responsible 
for managing junior staff, responding to emergency calls and managing 
vehicle and equipment problems.

Based at Heath Ambulance station near Nottingham, he was later stood down from his duties and was suspended from the Trust.

He admitted to using Entonox on September 9 last year, but asked to be given a second chance.

The report from the panel said Mr 
Moore had been abusing Entonox for a few months, since the beginning of 
May 2010. However, said it was not frequent, and it had been brought 
about by depression, stress and work pressures.

Panel chair Derek Adrian-Harris said:
'This was not a one-off event. On his own admission the Registrant had 
been abusing Entonox for a period of up to five months.

'There is sufficient evidence before 
the panel to determine that the registrant has addressed the issues or 
shown insight into his behaviour.

'The registrant was in a position of 
trust which he abused by using the Entonox, and set a very poor example 
to his junior colleagues. He has brought the profession into disrepute.

'There was a real risk that patients could have been put at risk, given the condition in which the registrant was found.'

Mr Moore, who was not at the hearing in London, was given a 12-month suspension.
