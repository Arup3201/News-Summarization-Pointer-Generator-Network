Michelle Obama made a daring decision to return to the same designer who created her Inaugural Ball dress four years ago - and the risk paid off.

The First Lady looked stunning in a sweeping, velvet and chiffon, ruby-colored dress by designer Jason Wu. She teamed the dramatic gown with heels by Jimmy Choo and a diamond ring by Kimberly McDonald.

She surprised the fashion establishment by returning to a Wu design which had been custom-made for her.

Four years ago at her first Inauguration Ball, Michelle shimmered in an off-white, one-shouldered 
floor-length couture gown by the designer.

Wu, who was 26 at the time and had 
only been working in fashion for three years, saw his career take off after the
First Lady's surprise decision to wear one of his dresses.

He said at the time that he was unaware she had chosen the gown and had been watching at home on his couch and eating pizza when she appeared.

After her 2013 decision, Wu told Women's Wear Daily: 'Mrs Obama likes to keep her secrets. She fooled me again.'

Wu released a women's clothing and 
accessories collection at Target last year and continues to be popular 
with the First Lady for official engagements.

Bold move: The First Lady once again endorsed designer Jason Wu with the daring dress

The sleeveless, cross-halterneck dress with low-cut back flattered 49-year-old Michelle's toned arms and neat waist.

It had been created especially for her by Wu and was a departure from the somber palette she stuck to at earlier inauguration events.

Mrs Obama's new hairstyle - she had bangs cut in on her birthday last week - had been loosely tousled for the special night.

Vice-President Joe Biden's wife Jill also looked glamorous in a blue silk dress by Vera Wang at the Inauguration Ball.

Earlier in the day, Mrs Obama wore a 
tailored navy coat by Thom Browne. She arrived at St. John's Episcopal 
Church across from the White House this morning with  daughters Malia and Sasha, her mother Marian Robinson and the President, keeping pre-inauguration tradition.

The coat was made from fabric specifically developed to mimic the style of a manâ€™s silk tie.

Power woman:The First Lady teamed her Thom Browne coat with a J Crew belt and gloves, and knee-high Reed Krakoff leather suede boots, which retail for $1,095

Thom Browne is still best known as a
menswear designer, and he often channels classic male style aesthetics 
for his womenswear line - with an outright feminine twist, like Mrs 
Obama's nipped-in waist and bell-shaped hem.

The designer told the New York Times' Eric Wilson: 'It's one of those moments when I just can't believe that happened.'

The First Lady teamed the outfit with a necklace designed by Cathy Waterman, and a J. Crew pumps, before changing into Reed Krakoff heels - adding an embellished J. Crew belt and purple J. Crew gloves.

For the inaugural luncheon, she took off
the heavy jacquard coat, revealing the Thom Browne dress underneath, and replaced it with the same Reed Krakoff 
cardigan she wore yesterday as President Obama took the official oath of office.

This isn't the first time Mrs Obama has worn Thom Browne.

The First Lady sported the same grey dress with black lace overlay for both the DNC speeches and the final presidential debate last year.

At the inauguration 
ceremony on Sunday at the White House, she chose another pitch perfect 
navy outfit: a silk dress by Reed Krakoff - the eponymous label set up by Coach's former creative head in 2010.

At the end of the Inaugural festivities, her outfit and accompanying accessories will go to the National
Archives.

Proving they have inherited the same 
sartorial instincts as their mother, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11, looked 
elegant in bright tailored outerwear that set off their mother's navy 
Thom Browne dress-coat.

Looking sharp: Michelle and her daughters' coats all echoed the same fitted, full-skirted silhouette

Malia
chose amethyst J Crew - the same label she and her sister wore for her 
father's first swearing-in ceremony four years ago.

She teamed it with 
an oxblood snood, tights and ballerina flats, and navy gloves which 
picked out the shade of the blue dress she wore beneath.

In turn, Sasha earned style stripes of her own in a full-skirted lavender Kate Spade coat and a dress from the same label.

At ease: Cheeky Sasha leans over to her mother -
clad in Thom Browne - as she and her sister prepare to take their seats
for today's ceremony
