A spirited dog who was pinned under the tree that killed his owner and her best friend for 12 hours has been pulled out alive.

Max suffered lacerations in his mouth, a broken jaw and head injuries and was discovered next to the dead bodies of Jessie Streich-Kest, 24, and Jacob Vogelman,
23, who walked him in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, New York, believing the worst of Superstorm Sandy had
passed.

They were crushed at around 8pm on Monday evening but in the chaos their 
bodies were not found until 7.55am on Tuesday.

'Inseparable': Max was adopted by Jessie Streich-Kest, 24, who was killed with her friend when they walked him - but he was rescued and taken to hospital

Max was adopted by Jessie, a special needs teacher, from the ASPCA.

When
the crushed pit-bull was found, he was taken to Verg South, a 
veterinary hospital in Brooklyn, who treated his injuries and will look 
after him until he is fit enough to back and live with Miss 
Streich-Kest's bereft family.

'It's just a testament to Max's spirit that he pulled through this tragedy,' the vet who is treating him, Brett Levitzke, said.

'It's also a testament to his owner 
that she went to a local shelter and saved putting him to sleep. That's 
why the whole story is really heartbreaking, but hopefully it will have a
happy ending for Max.

'Max was definitely critical for the past few days, but over the past 24 
hours, he has taken quite a turn for the better,' adding he is out of his cage and now eating.

'He's a ton better,' he said. 'The fact is, Max is a real trooper.'

Max is one of at least 100 pets who 
were rescued in New York during Superstorm Sandy, but many more may be 
stranded, lost or dead.

Verg
South hospital has used generators to operate 24 hours a day, treating 
animals with ailments like broken bones, brain swellings, stress and 
vomiting caused by the violence and toxicity of the flood waters. 

Mr
Levitzke said: 'He (Max) was mentally very dull because of head trauma'
and that he will probably need surgery in the coming days.

'Jessie was a wonderful, amazing human being and they were a perfect 
match, so I am happy he is surviving,' family friend Barbara Gross said, adding about Max. 'They were inseparable.'

She told the New York Times:
'We had no idea. I was outside taking pictures of my house for the 
insurance when a cop said "back up, back up" and I saw a young man dead 
under the tree.'

Ms Streich-Kest grew up in the Prospect Park South area of Brooklyn and
was a teaching fellow who had just started teaching at the Bushwick 
School for Social Justice.

Friends said she had been relieved to get 
through her first parents' evening at the high school last week.

She was also an activist who campaigned to stop abuse of the carriage 
horses in Central Park, following in the footsteps of her father, Jon, 
who is a prominent Union figure. Facebook photographs showed her 
attending the 2008 inauguration of President Obama in Washington.

At
least 90 people are now known to have died after the monster storm felled 
enormous trees, downed dangerous power lines, swamped homes with 
floodwater and inflicted billions of dollars’ worth of damage.

Neighbour Matt MacLean said: 'Jessie was first a student and then a 
friend of mine. I can't believe that she's not here anymore. Her passion
for animal welfare, political activism, and her new career as a high 
school teacher were so amazing.

'She could plow through all sorts of obstacles and her fortitude 
was a sight to behold. My heart goes out to her family, it just doesn't 
seem real.’

Her family released the following statement: 'Just 24 years old, 
Jessie Streich-Kest left a lasting impression on all who met her, and 
especially on her students at Bushwick HS for Social Justice, to whom 
she was deeply committed.

'Jessie loved life and was deeply devoted to social justice.'

Mr Vogelman, also from Brooklyn, was studying at Brooklyn College campus of the City University of New York.

A keen thespian, he had studied theatre at the University of Nevada in 
Las Vegas and formerly worked as a stagehand at the MGM Grand.
