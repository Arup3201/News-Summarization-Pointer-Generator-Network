With over 1.3billion people in the world living without electricity, suggesting a game of football seems the least likely solution to help the chronic problem.

But two charitable entrepreneurs have seemingly come up with a way to guarantee power for those left in the darkness - an energy harnessing football.

By kicking the SOCCKET ball around, players can generate enough electricity in a 30 minute game to power a LED lamp for three hours.

President Barack Obama kicks the energy-storing soccer ball at Ubungo Power Plant in Dar es Salaam

On your head! The president looked impressed with the ball - which could end millions of people relying on harmful alternative energy supplies

And today, President Barack Obama got to witness just how powerful the ball can be.

The president kicked, headed and dribbled the ball around during an event at the Ubungo power plant to promote energy innovation in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, CBS reported.

Weighing 17 ounces— just one ounce more than a normal soccer ball - the ball contains a pendulum-like mechanism, which captures the kinetic energy generated during normal play, and stores it in the ball for later use as an off-grid power source.

Lighting up lives: The balls could spell the end of unreliable power sources, the social enterprise says

Bright idea: The power kits mean that if children play with the ball through school, they can plug them in to light up their homework every day

It is the creation of Uncharted Play - a for-profit social enterprise founded in May 2011 by Jessica O. Matthews and Julia Silverman.

The pair, who met at Harvard College when they were studying to be social scientists, had no engineering expertise, but worked on the creation of the pioneering ball.

The invention could mean an end to unpredictable power sources - and the termination of harmful power sources that are extremely damaging to users' health.

'Households use kerosene lamps, diesel generators, and wood burning stoves, which are harmful to the environment and cause nearly 2 million deaths per year,' Uncharted Play said.

'Living with fumes from one kerosene lamp is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes every day,' it added.

The enterprise says it has created power kits: 'consists of 1 SOCCKET and 10 Portable Lamps. That way, children living in off-grid communities can play with a single SOCCKET ball as a team at school and still have their own personal light for reading and homework at home
