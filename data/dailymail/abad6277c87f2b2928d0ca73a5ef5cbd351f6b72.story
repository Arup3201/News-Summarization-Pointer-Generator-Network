Armed police were involved in a tense stand-off after cornering a rampaging bullock that smashed its way into a house.

Firearms officers dashed to the scene to tackle a herd of cattle that went on the run after escaping from a field in Heacham, Norfolk.

During the mayhem, one of the animals crashed through the glass patio doors of a house and caused serious damage to the lounge.

At one point, police with automatic weapons looked like they were preparing to shoot the intruder, but the bull eventually surrendered peacefully.

Police said four bullocks were still at large last night and warned the public not to approach them.

The startled homeowner, who was still clearing up, was too shocked to comment on the bizarre break-in.

But neighbour Ron Clark, 63, said: 'I was in the kitchen making breakfast when I saw a cow coming up to where my fence is.

'I thought I was seeing things. It then shot across into someone's patio and into their living room. I feel lucky that it didn't cause any damage to us.

'I care for my mum, who is 93, and my brother, who's got emphysema. It frightened me because something could have happened to them. How do you stop a half-tonne cow?'

After the animal had calmed down, he was coaxed onto a trailer by Heacham farmer Terry Sanderson, 65, before being driven away.

Another escaped bullock was earlier shot by a farm worker after it attacked Mr Sanderson, leaving him with heavy cuts to his arm.

Mr Sanderson, who farms at Heacham South Beach, said: 'I can only apologise. I don't want that to happen to anyone. I didn't want it to go in the house.'

He added: 'It was the last thing in the world that I wanted. All I can say is that I am very sorry and I will sort it out with the insurance company.'

The drama began just before 11am yesterday.

A parish council workman had earlier tried to head off the bullock with the help of passersby.

'They all came running up the street,' said one woman who witnessed the stand-off. The man who drives the little parish council van around here tried to use it as a barrier.

'There were six big blokes with him. They got across the road, but it just ran right through them.

'It got down the end of the road by the bakery and then it skedaddled off. Police and the parish council truck have been driving around looking for it.'

Council maintenance worker Robert Bradley said: 'I tried to stop the animal running down into Station Road but it scuttled across the front of my van.

'I just happened to be there and I thought I might be able to stop it charging down the road.'

A Norfolk Police spokeswoman said: 'We heard that a bull had got into a property in Station Road.

'Officers attended and liaised with the farmer to come and remove his bull.'

Last night, the force tweeted four bullocks were still at large and should not be approached.
