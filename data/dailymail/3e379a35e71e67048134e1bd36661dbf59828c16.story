As a fast-rising Shadow Minister in Ed Miliband’s team, Lisa Nandy is a model of earnest concern as she debates the future of Britain’s schools.

But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Wigan MP has not always been so careful to project a serious image.

As the editor of a ‘Dear Lisa’ column in her university newspaper, Miss Nandy starred in a photo casebook which detailed her search for a male sex partner and also showed her naked in bed with another woman.

Up front: Lisa Nandy certainly made an impression with this low-cut effort in the House of Commons

Miss Nandy, now Shadow Children’s Minister, was the figurehead of the column in Newcastle University’s Courier student newspaper.

Styling herself as ‘The woman who likes a bit of hot mail’, the politics undergraduate appeared in a comic book-style photostrip recording her quest to bag a boyfriend.

‘I’ll never find a man!’ she moans in the strip, psimon mursimon  urrinted 13 years ago. Then, when a friend suggests a suitable partner, Miss Nandy is pictured opposite the prospective male with her hands pressed against her face in exasperation. A thought bubble reads: ‘Oh, my God! I’m not .  .  . s******g THAT!’

Later, as she is chatted up by another student who offers her a drink, Miss Nandy says: ‘I’d love a stiff one! Actually, d’ya wanna come back to my place?’

After apparently having sex with him, the MP is pictured discussing the incident with a friend. Using her fingers to illustrate her point, she complains: ‘The smallest I’ve ever seen! I’m going back on the pull .  .  .’

Just as she is giving up hope, a Fairy Godfather intervenes promising to ‘sort it out’. She is then pictured naked in bed with another woman. Miss Nandy, who has her arms wrapped around the attractive blonde, says: ‘Ooh, I thought you only had your ears pierced!!!’

Torrid: Lisa Nandy's comic book search for sex in a student paper

The 33-year-old MP, elected to Parliament on an all-women shortlist, was at the centre of a sexism row shortly after winning her seat in 2010 when she sat directly behind Mr Miliband in the Commons wearing a low-cut top, prompting a storm of debate on Twitter.

During her time in charge of her student column, Miss Nandy also dispensed advice to readers. In one column she wrote: ‘As I’ve said many times over the course of this year, THERE ARE NO FIT MEN AT THIS UNIVERSITY.’

She adds: ‘There’s a lot of diversity in a university – virgins, slimy b******s who offer to buy you a drink but have no intention of doing any such thing, geeks, the lot. The trick is how to spot them. You can usually identify a virgin from a thousand paces, cos they’ll be trendy dressers and well into dance music.’

Miss Nandy adds: ‘The only solution is to quit the manhunt and wait till after uni when you’re back amongst normal people.’

In another photo casebook, she appears to advocate smoking marijuana before writing an essay.

A male student is pictured smoking a ‘spliff’ to ‘calm his essay crisis’, then gets a first for his essay.

Miss Nandy adds: ‘Before the anti-drugs lobby gets straight on my case, I am not about to advocate getting caned before a deadline.’

In another column, a third-year student asks for advice on how to hit on first-year students. Miss Nandy says: ‘.  .  . you could try pulling in the Union when Red Bull and vodka is on special – it works for me.’ Last night the MP claimed her columns were meant to be humorous and did not reflect her personal views.

She said: ‘This was a spoof piece published by my student newspaper over 13 years ago. It was intentionally humorous and clearly didn’t reflect my views then, or now.’
