Suspects: Police in New Bedford are still searching for the woman in the winter hate. Veroinic Mello, (front) has already turned herself into police

Police in Massachusetts have arrested one of two women accused of stealing a donation jar meant for a 4-year-old girl with leukemia.

Veronica Mello, 32, turned herself into police on Tuesday after security camera footage was released showing two suspects swiping the money from the counter at Mark's Beverage store in New Bedford.

The jar was filled with money for Haylie Jansen, who is battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia  since her diagnosis in early January and who is due to undergo a third surgery on Wednesday.

Police have said they are still trying to find the second suspect, who is seen in the surveillance footage wearing a grey sweatshirt, backpack and bobble hat.

Mello, 32, who lives in New Bedford, turned herself into police station on Tuesday and will be arraigned on a larceny charge on Wednesday.

'I'm a nervous wreck right now. This is getting to be too much,' said a woman who identified herself as Veronica Mello's mother to the Boston Herald. She added she belives her daughter is innocent.

Relatives for little Haylie said they can't believe speople would be so despicable - especially since more than $15,000 has been raised already via a gofundmepage for Hailey.

'I can't believe that someone would do something like that, steal money from a little 4-year-old girl with cancer,' said Dorothy Jansen, who is Haylie's great-aunt.

'We want them both caught and we want them to have to step up and apologize to our family.'

Haylie's grandmother, Jen Magrath, told the Boston Herald that despite the 4-year-old's diagnosis, she has still continued to smile.

'She's the kind of girl who could put a smile on your face on your darkest day,' said Magrath.

'If you look at pictures of her, you'll never find one where she isn't smiling. She's just such a happy child.'

Haylie's mother, Jessica Jansen has been struggling financially and to help out, her family put four donation jars in four local businesses in New Bedford and Dartmouth.

Donations: Hailey has a gonfundme page and so far has managed to raise $15,000 for her medical care

'My daughter is the kind of person who hates to accept help from anyone, so it was hard for her,' said Magrath.

'We're all still trying to convince her to take all the help she can get because she's had to put her entire life on hold to be there for Haylie.'

The owner of Mark's Beverae store, Nabubhei Patel, said that the two thieves worked in tandem to steal the jar.

Jen Magrath said that the entire family has been rocked by the theft.

'The hardest thing for us is that Jessica has worked three jobs since she was 15 years old to get herself into school, she got a degree as a dental hygienist, which she worked very hard for, and then she had no choice but to quit.'
