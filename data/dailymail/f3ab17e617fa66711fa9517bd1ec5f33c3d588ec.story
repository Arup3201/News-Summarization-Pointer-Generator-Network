Doctor Zyad Younan claims he was drugged during his visits to the strip club but the company is refusing to drop its claim for his $135,000 bill

A strip club is continuing its lawsuit against a wealthy doctor to try and settle his massive $135,000 bill, despite police claims he was the victim of a gang of strippers who drugged and scammed at least $200,000 from their victims.

Police recently arrested a crew of New York City strippers who they say were spiking wealthy men's drinks before dragging them to strip clubs to rack up enormous charges on their credit cards.

Now a strip club at the centre of the offending is refusing to drop its lawsuit against Dr. Zyad Younan for a massive bill he incurred.

The New York Post reported the strip club Scores' attorney Alison Blaine as saying Dr. Younan's big spending was voluntary.

'He was at the club three times. He was drugged three times?,' she said.

Drug
 Enforcement Administration and New York Police Department investigators
 recently arrested four women: Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and
 Marsi Rosen, on charges including grand larceny, assault and forgery in 
relation to the scam.

Dr Younan is just one of four victims, which also includes a banker, a lawyer and a real estate attorney, to be plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens.

Once there the women would whisk the intoxicated men away for private dances and then take away their credit cards while they were too wasted to stop it.

Busted: Samantha Barbash, is escorted by law enforcement officers following her arrest in New York. Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze

Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court on Tuesday night after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City

Carmine Vitolo, a manager at the Roadhouse was also charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with physical evidence.

According to court papers, the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013.

The roundup followed an undercover investigation that found that the women joined in a scheme to rip off the men by drugging them with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'.

According to court papers, Samantha Barbash was the ring-leader along with Roselyn Keo.

Barbash’s attorney, Stephen Murphy, has said his client denies the charges.

Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City

Destination: This is Scores gentlemen's club in Manhattan - one of the destination for the women after they allegedly drugged their victims

Once they had given their victims the drugs the women then took the men to the clubs and brought the inebriated men to private rooms for dances and then stole their cards and racked up huge charges.

The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount.

'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.'

Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men

Exotic: This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens - another favorite destination of the strippers

Indeed, in some cases the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them.

The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000.

Special
 Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only 
the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security 
of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.'
