Held: Ted Beston has been arrested by police on suspicion of molesting 
young girls while working as a producer on Jimmy Savile's shows

Former BBC producer Ted Beston has 'vehemently denied' claims that he molested young women while working for Jimmy Savile.

Mr Beston, 76, was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives early yesterday morning on suspicion of historic sexual offences.

In a statement released through his lawyers today, the former Radio 1 producer said he was shocked by the allegations.

The statement added: 'What emerged in October 2012 was a side of Savile that Mr Beston never knew.

'Mr Beston vehemently denies the historic allegations put to him by the police.

'When the Savile story surfaced in October, Mr Beston made clear then that he was shocked by the allegations.

'For the time being, Mr Beston will be saying nothing further and we request that Mr Beston, who is now 76, be allowed to deal with these false claims without undue intrusion.'

The producer, nicknamed 'Uncle' Ted by Savile on air, was bailed until february.

Mr Beston, 76, was held at his home in Bromley, South London, at 6.30am and taken to a police station

He became a close friend of Savile’s while working for years as his producer on Radio 1 on shows including Savile’s Travels.

Beston is accused of procuring girls for Savile and other men to molest in the 1960s and 1970s.

Some women have also claimed that he sexually assaulted them himself.

Beston categorically denied the allegations, saying: ‘I can’t see why the accusations have been made. I knew Jimmy had girlfriends around the country but I was totally unaware of any under-aged children.’

He is the eighth man to be arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the Savile sex abuse investigation. He was bailed until February.

In Savile's Travels, Savile travelled across the UK talking to members of the public.

They also worked together on the Jimmy Savile Old Record Club and the Double Top Ten Show.

Mr Beston produced several shows for Savile and also used his skills producing hit shows for DJ Mike Read and latterly Simon Mayo's Breakfast Show in the 80s.

Throughout the course of yesterday there were signs of police activity at Mr Beston's house.

Three men in suits were seen leaving the premises in two cars carrying a large black holdall and three sealed black bin liners.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said yesterday: 'A man arrested earlier today in connection with Operation 
Yewtree - [Yewtree 8] has this afternoon left police premises.

'He has been bailed to return on a date in February 2013.

'The man, who is in his 70s and from London, was arrested at 06.30hrs on 
suspicion of sexual offences and taken into custody at a south London 
police station.

'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed "Savile and others".'

The force is leading the national 
probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in
the entertainment industry.

It is understood that up to 25 celebrities have been named to police.

A source with knowledge of the inquiry told the Sunday Times: 'They all tend to be white men of the Savile generation'.

In some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough evidence for the celebrities to be arrested.

The investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers.

Last week a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences.

PR guru Max Clifford was arrested earlier on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe.

A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago.

Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

On Monday, Starr and Clifford were re-bailed to return on dates in February and March pending further inquiries.

Officers are looking at claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.

Last week police revealed a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Jimmy Savile.

Detectives said they had received 199 complaints of sex attacks against the late BBC star from 450 different people.

Savile is said to have carried out the attacks in 17 police force areas.

Detectives said that 589 complainants – the majority of whom were young girls at the times of the alleged incidents – had contacted police as part of a wider inquiry into sexual attacks carried out by Savile and others.
