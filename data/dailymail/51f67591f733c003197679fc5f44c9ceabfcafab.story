F&F's new collection may be sold in Tesco, but with its vibrant colours and graphic on-trend prints, it looks fresh off the catwalks - and costs a fraction of the price.

Inspired by the colourful street art of the city's Santa Marta area, the eclectic high summer collection is full of colourful
Aztec motif swimwear, printed jumpsuits, shorts and maxi dresses.

Embracing the sportsluxe trend seen on every catwalk, the collection offers mesh panel crop jumpers, crochet lace shorts and geometric clutch-bags.

Welcome to Rio! F&F's SS14 campaign was shot in the favelas of Rio, which are now globally renowned as an culturally inspirational and creative hotspot (blouse, £16)

There's a nod to the season’s taste for soft, feminine ladylike shapes in the form of 50s hourglass dresses in pretty pastel shades and organza panelled midi skirts.

Swimwear is loud and proud with clashing leopard and deep purple prints emblazoned across swimming costumes and push-up bikinis.

Prints charming: Swimwear, which is offered in swimming costumes and bikini styles, is emblazoned with loud and graphic Aztec prints (left, £15, right, bikini top, £8)

Catwalk coveted: The range seemingly took inspiration from all the heavy hitting designers, such as Burberry, with lovely lace a key theme (cardigan, £15, top, £16)

Fun fashion: The range hopes to transport women to the colourful streets of Rio (left, £16), while metallics and smart jackets add a sophisticated edge (right, jacket, £28, top, £9, shorts, £8)

There are Burberry-esque lace midi skirts, casual denim shorts and eye-catching floral kaftans, which all cost under £40.

Fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones said: 'This is a really impressive and directional offering from F&F and they continue to go from strength to strength as an on-trend label.

Cut-price fashion: The colourful new collection is all priced under £40 and features casual beachwear, as well as more sophisticated styles (trousers, £14, top, £8)

Directional: Organza, as seen at Temperley and Ellie Saab, and lace, as seen everywhere, featur heavily in the new range

'They've clearly been taking note of the SS14 catwalks to offer a lot of trend-led pieces that are bound to brighten up the nation's summer wardrobe.'

The new range, which has just started to drop online, was even featured in this month's Vogue.

F&F collections are currently available in over 850 stores in the UK and over 2000 globally.
