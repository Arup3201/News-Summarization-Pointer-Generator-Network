A new survey of retired NFL players' brains has found signs of a degenerative disease in what is heralded as the first evidence of early detection in former players while they're still alive.

Until now, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) had not been spotted in the brains of players until after their death.

Such was the case with former NFL linebacker Junior Seau, who was found to have the disease - which can lead to dementia and behavioral problems - months after he committed suicide in May.

NFL players who suffer repeated head injuries in the course of their professional careers could be more prone to CTE, but it has been reported in other athletes and members of the military.

Loss: Former linebacker Junior Seau, in Dec. 2008, committed suicide in 2012. An autopsy showed he suffered from a degenerative brain disease after 20 seasons in the NFL

Scientists at UCLA used a new image 
technique to analyze the impact of head trauma on the brain health of 
five retired NFL players.

Results
 from the scans, known as positron emission tomography (PET), show the 
accumulation of abnormal tau protein, which can indicate the onset of 
future brain disease.

The tau proteins are believed to be connected to CTE and Alzheimer's disease. 

'This is the first time we have done these PET scans in NFL players who are retired,' Dr Gary Small, UCLA’s Parow-Solomon Professor on aging and a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA, told FoxNews.com.

'So it's the first time to show what 
we think are these tau protein deposits. What's extraordinary about that
 is the patterns of the deposits were identical to patterns in CTE, 
which is only diagnosed through autopsy. The logical conclusion is 
that's what we’re seeing - suggestive this is the first time we're 
visualizing CTE.'

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia.

Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later.

To test 
the brain imaging scan, Dr Small injected a chemical biomarker called 
FDDNP, which attaches to the tau proteins, into the brains of the five 
former athletes.

This allowed scientists to identify which sections of the brain had higher levels of FDDNP.

Scans revealed that the more concussions the athlete had experienced, the higher levels of tau protein were discovered.

Seau was a star linebacker for 20 NFL seasons with the San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins and 
New England Patriots before retiring in 2009. He died of a self-inflicted shotgun
 wound.

An autopsy on the athlete showed he suffered from the brain disease. He joins a list of several dozen football players who have had CTE.

CTE often impacts a person's behavior with symptoms including depression, suicidal thoughts and memory loss.

'There are other connections here that are relevant,' Small said.

'Recent studies have found that NFL players have a four times greater probability of dying from Alzheimer's than the general population. 

'In other studies, if you look at people, not just athletes, but people in general who’ve had a concussion that has led to an hour of unconsciousness - it doubles their risk of Alzheimer’s.'
