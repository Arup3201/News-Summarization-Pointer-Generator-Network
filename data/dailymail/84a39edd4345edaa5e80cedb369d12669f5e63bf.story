A Maine man faces drunk driving charges after allegedly using his riding lawn mower to make a beer run.

Police say convenience store employees turned away 51-year-old Tony Caulder when he came to Cummings Market in Kennebunk on October 19 because they thought he was drunk.

The employees followed the man outside to make sure he wasn't getting into a car and called police when he rode off on the lawn mower.

Tony Caulder, 51, was arrested for a DUI after being found by Maine police driving his lawnmower drunk on a public road on October 19

He had earlier been seen pumping gas into his lawnmower on the forecourt.

Police charged him with operating under the influence after stopping him a short time later.

Nobody answered at a phone listed in Caulder's name.

The 51-year-old was released on bail the next day and is scheduled to make a court appearance in January.

Under Maine law, riding a lawnmower on a public road is illegal but as Caulder's type of machine is defined as a motor vehicle, officers issued a DUI they told WMTV.

Tony Caulder, who is originally from Marion, South Carolina, is married and works at the nonprofit organization Goodwill Industries.

The riding lawn mower is classed as a motor vehicle which led to Caulder being charged with a DUI
