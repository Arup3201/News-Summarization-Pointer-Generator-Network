Geraint Thomas claimed third place at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic in Belgium on Sunday despite suffering a crash.

The Welshman's spill came with 58 kilometres to go when he was blown off the road in wet and windy conditions in Flanders, but the Team Sky rider bravely fought back to claim a podium place.

Katusha's Luca Paolini took the title with Niki Terpstra of Etixx-Quick-Step finishing runner-up.

Commonwealth Games champion Thomas, who took victory in E3 Harelbeke on Friday, said on www.teamsky.com: 'Today it was just on all day - stress and full gas.

'I'm happy to be on the podium again. Obviously it would have been nice to go for the win but it's hard when you're coming into the final and everyone's attacking. You can't really go with everything and some people don't want to pull as much.

On his crash, Thomas added: 'The grass was softer than the tarmac! It was unbelievable. The gusts were incredible. It was hard enough just trying to stay on the bike. Fortunately it was all okay in the end.

'I'll rest up now. Have a good massage, eat well, stay in bed and put my feet up until Sunday.'

Sir Bradley Wiggins was included in the Team Sky line-up for the 239-kilometre one-day event but withdrew during the race.
