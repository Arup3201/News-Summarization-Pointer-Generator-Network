Two brothers have died within 10 days of one another, both leaving behind wives and young daughters.

Eric and Edwin Kaupang, aged 30 and 31 respectively, from Minnesota, both died unexpectedly.

Eric 'Smash' Kaupang died suddenly on January 2 as he made his way to work on an oil rig in Alaska.

Brothers: Eric Kaupang, 30, and his brother Edwin Kaupang, 31

Early years: The brothers and best friends as children

He was the father of a two-month-old 
baby girl, Evelynn Jean Kaupang, with his fiancee Lindsey Perry, to whom
 he became engaged on the same day as his brother's wedding.

Edwin 'Eddie' Kaupang, devastated by the loss, posted on his Facebook page two days later:

'I

devastated and heartbroken... Eric Kaupang say hi to grandma and six and
 Gary and everyone else i miss you so much already it's (expletive) 
killing me i will see you in Valhalla brother i love you.'

Just over a week after he made that post, Edwin Kaupang also died.

The morning Eric Kaupang's funeral, Edwin Kaupang's wife Kiley Kaupang went to wake her husband, who had fallen asleep where he sat in a chair the night before.

She found him dead. It was later discovered that Edwin Kaupang had an enlarged heart, a condition he was not aware of.

Edwin and Kiley Kaupang were married in 2012 and had a daughter, Bella, in 2010.

Just before his death, as he mourned the loss of his brother he posted a picture of the smiling little girl on Facebook, writing, 'This beautiful little girl can make me smile on the worst days of my life i love you peanut.'

The devoted father frequently posted pictures of his daughter to his Facebook page, and his obituary notes that he loved to have tea parties with the almost-four-year-old.

Eric Kaupang traveled to Alaska to work every three weeks and resided the rest of the time with his family in Minnesota.

Edwin had established his own painting and construction business and worked hard to make it successful.

Lindsey Perry and Kiley Kaupang were both stay-at-home mothers who are now left to raise their daughters alone.

Friends and family of the popular brothers have already raised almost $5,000.
