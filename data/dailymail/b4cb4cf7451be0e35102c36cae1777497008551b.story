Ukip was embroiled in a Nazi scandal today - after one of its candidates was photographed naked showing off a series of Third Reich-themed tattoos.

Kevin O’Doherty, who is standing for a seat in Hastings, East Sussex, appears alongside a naked middle aged man poised to snort white powder off a young women's lower back. There is no suggestion the substance is a class A drug.

His left arm is covered with a series of offensive images - including a German eagle, used by Hitler during the Second World War, and two German planes diving towards a Jewish Star of David, coloured in yellow — the same colour as the badge Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is under increasing scrutiny over extremist candidates within his party

The shock image comes as the party's leader Nigel Farage was challenged over another candidate's suggestion for gay men to be shot to force other homosexuals to 'decide' to be straight.

John Sullivan wrote on Facebook in February: 'I rather wonder if we shot one 'poofter' (GBLT whatevers [sic]), whether the next 99 would decide on balance, that they weren't after-all? We might then conclude that it's not a matter of genetics, but rather more a matter of education.'

Mr Farage said he had never heard of Mr Sullivan and said he would face a 'disciplinary charge'.

The Ukip leader also claimed his party was given a rougher ride in the media than the other parties.

But he was not challenged over the Nazi shame pictures which emerged on the website Political Scrapbook earlier today.

Mr O'Doherty, the candidate at the centre of the row, is standing for Ukip in Hastings where the party boasts one councillor.

The picture - for a limited edition art book, The Dualism Volume 2 - was allegedly taken when he worked as a part-time character model.

MailOnine attempted to contact Mr O'Doherty at his email address, which includes the phrase 'stukeboy', but he did not reply to our emails.

The plane on the top of his arm is similar to a Stuka dive bomber, used by the Nazis in their invasions of France, Poland and Russia.

Nigel Farage faces a barrage of hostile questions on LBC earlier today. The Ukip leader was accused of being a divisive politician playing on people's antagonism towards foreigners

A telephone number for the Ukip candidate is not publicly listed, but a party source told MailOnline they were 'working on the assumption' that the man in the picture was Mr O'Doherty.

But they would only release a statement claiming that they were not a racist party and would be investigating the allegations.

A former Ukip supporter, described as a 'rising star' by Nigel Farage, quit the party this week - claiming it was pandering to racists

A Ukip spokesman said: 'Ukip is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values.

'Where evidence is produced to indicate a breach it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the National Executive Committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.'

Mr O’Doherty has previously sparked controversy by writing on Facebook that ‘there is no such thing as a benign Muslim’.

He posted the remarks in relation to a story he shared about a Birmingham school at the centre of allegations of a takeover plot by Islamic hardliners.

Mr O'Doherty is standing as a Ukip candidate in the Central St Leonards ward in the Hastings Borough Council elections on May 22.

The post, dated April 21, said: 'There is no such thing as a benign Muslim, only a latent adherent of Koranic dogma.'

He also defended a Ukip candidate who said comedian Lenny Henry should ‘emigrate to a black country’.

Mr O’Doherty wrote on the Daily Telegraph’s Facebook site: 'Lenny Henry is the one who raised the issue of racism by his proposition.

'The repudiation may not be pretty, but does it not have validity? He wants to set quotas which will do more harm than good. He is an opportunist grandstander.'
