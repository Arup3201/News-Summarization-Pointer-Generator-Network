The man sent to Brussels to spearhead David Cameron's plans to claw powers back from the EU has been dismissed as a 'charming' man with 'no grasp of the issues'.

Lord Hill was nominated by the Prime Minister to be the UK's European Commissioner, at a crucial time for his hopes of renegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU.

But after being selected for the financial services brief, doubts have been raised about the Tory peer's suitability for the job, as he told MEPs that he intends to serve European interests and not the City's in his new role of financial regulator. 

Vow: Conservative peer Lord Hill has promised MEPs that he intents to serve European interests and not the City's in his new role of financial regulator

Lord Hill was a surprise choice for the commissioner role in July, after previously ruling himself out because he wanted to stay in Britain.

It was seen as a coup for the UK when new Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker handed him the financial services brief.

Appearing at a confirmation hearing yesterday, he appeared to charm MEPs with jokes about the Queen but he left them short of details, and will be recalled for a second questioning session next week.

Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, who was among those to grill Lord Hill yesterday, dismissed him as 'charming but empty'.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Lord Hill is a charming person but behind his charm there was apparently little knowledge of the subject matter at hand.

'It is not about knowing the intricate details of financial regulation, it was even the main lines that apparently Lord Hill had no grasp of.'

He claimed that on a range of major issues including capital markets union, banks which are 'too big to fail' and Euro bonds, 'there was not a single idea put forward by Lord Hill that showed that he had a least some conceptions about these things'.  

He suggested that criticism of Lord Hill would be more intense were Britain's relationship with Brussels not already under strain.

'No one would claim that he had knowledge of the issues at hand. No I think that the main factor that played was that some people were hesitant to send a rebuke to the UK at times when the relationship between the UK and the European Union are quite tense.

'He may be a good commissioner, but I would probably not assign him this portfolio.'

During the hearing, Lord Hill promised to put European laws before the interests of London, denying  accusations that as a former lobbyist he would be a stooge for Britain's  financial services industry.

Addressing the European Parliament, he said he backed strong regulation of the industry, and vowed to enforce rules governing bankers' bonuses.

'I want Britain to be part of a successful European Union,' said Lord Hill, the former leader of Britain's House of Lords.  I want to work for the common European interest.'  

Appointment: Lord Hill's nomination in September was widely seen as an olive branch from Mr Juncker to an increasingly europhobic Mr Cameron

He is the first member of Jean-Claude Juncker's incoming European Commission team to be recalled since the parliamentary interviews started on Monday. 

The fate of Spain's energy and climate commissioner-designate Miguel Arias Canete was also in doubt after he faced a barrage of questions about alleged conflicts of interest and sexism.

The European Parliament can ask Juncker to change members of his line-up - as it has done previously in 2004 and 2009 - and it must approve the entire commission in a vote on October 22.  

Lord Hill's nomination in September was widely seen as an olive branch from Mr Juncker to an increasingly europhobic Mr Cameron, who has promised a refrendum on Britain's EU membership in 2017.

But he insisted that he backed strong regulation, saying he was 'not here as a representative of the City of London'.

He joked to MEPs about his poor command of foreign languages, and won applause by brushing off a question from a eurosceptic British lawmaker about his loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II.

However, a European source later said that his answers 'lacked content' and that he would get a 'second chance' next Monday or Tuesday to explain the details of his policy on key financial issues.

'Hill does not get confirmation today. He will be invited to a new public exchange of views' with the economic affairs committee, Green euro-MP Sven Giegold wrote on Twitter. 

Controversial: The fate of Spain's energy and climate commissioner-designate Miguel Arias Canete was also in doubt

Mr Canete was repeatedly forced to deny accusations of a conflict of interest after having sold his shares in two oil firms shortly after his nomination to the energy job in September, while his son resigned from the board of one company.

'The very day I knew I was being appointed the commissioner, I ordered to sell the shares,' he . From the outset I have said I have no conflict of interest,' said Mr Canete, whose job is crucial at a time when the EU faces tensions with major gas supplier Russia.

The bearded Spaniard also apologised for alleged sexism after making macho comments towards a female rival at a debate last year.

'It was indeed an unfortunate comment and I apologise once again to you,' he said.

More than 300,000 people, including 76 EU parliamentarians, had signed a petition against his appointment. There was also a 'Stop Canete' protest by the Greens and the radical left outside parliament.

Hungary's Tibor Navracsics, a former justice minister, faced a rough ride too on Wednesday, having repeatedly clashed with the EU over Hungarian Prime Minster Viktor Orban's crackdown on media regulation and the justice system.

His nomination as Culture, Education, Youth and Citizenship commissioner was particuarly galling to critics given Orban's deep euroscepticsm - Orban and Britain's Cameron were the only national leaders to oppose Juncker's election in June.

But Navracsics also sought to play up his pro-Brussels credentials, saying: 'I am proud of being a European and will be proud of being a European in the future.'

The European Commission is the EU's executive branch, and will spearhead policy for the body for the next five years.
