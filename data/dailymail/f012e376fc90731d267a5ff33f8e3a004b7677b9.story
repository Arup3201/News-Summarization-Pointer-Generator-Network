A man and a woman who had 'known each other just minutes' left dozens of shoppers in California horrified after they stripped off and had sex in front of a crowded prom dress store in broad daylight.

The strangers, who had reportedly met on the trolley and 'did not know each other's names', were spotted writhing around  outside Christina's Dress Shop in Chula Vista at around 3.30pm on Friday.

For the first 15 minutes, they cuddled and kissed while fully dressed, witnesses said. Then, the man stripped off his clothes and began 'getting sexual' with the woman, who was still wearing a skirt.

Shop owner, Christy Peterson, who captured the amorous encounter on video through the window, said the sight had shocked shoppers inside and outside of the store, including a woman with a baby.

Shocking: Two strangers left dozens of shoppers in California horrified when they stripped off and had sex in front of a prom dress store. Above, the man and woman are pictured just seconds before they 'got sexual'

Scene: The strangers, who had met on the San Diego Trolley and did not know each others' names, were spotted writhing around outside Christina's Dress Shop (pictured) in Chula Vista at around 3.30pm on Friday

'They were rolling on the ground, making out and getting sexual,' said Ms Peterson, adding that she had later heard police  refer to the woman as being 37, while the man was 'not even 21 years old'.

In the video footage, the strangers can be seen rolling around on the sidewalk outside the dress shop in Palomar Street, which was crammed with teenage girls shopping for prom gowns at the time.

The man is captured donning a yellow hooded top, pants and sneakers, while his lover is dressed in a yellow T-shirt, a skirt and ballet pumps. Both appear unaware that  their actions were being filmed.

Ms Peterson said the woman kept her skirt on as the cuddling escalated to sex. 'Her legs were in the air and the guy was on top. We were so shocked our mouths were just opened,' she told 10 News.

She added that when security failed to show up at the shopping strip mall, she called the police, while ushering customers to the back of the store in an attempt to shield them from the indecent display.

'We were just panicked and there were customers,' Ms Peterson told the news station. 'A woman with her baby and 16-, 17- [and] 18-year-old girls were here to shop for prom and got the shock of their life.'

A 17-year-old 'trainee' working her first day at the shop also saw the 'unbelievable' scene, she said.

After police arrived, the man was reportedly arrested. The woman, meanwhile, was handed a citation. Officers apparently later revealed the couple had  just met while commuting on the San Diego Trolley.

Detained: The man was reportedly arrested by police following the engagement, while the woman was handed a citation. The strangers remained 'cuddled up' while being dealt with by officers, Ms Peterson said

The strangers remained 'cuddled up' while being dealt with by officers, according to Ms Peterson.

It is not the first time a couple has hit the headlines after being caught having sex in public view.

Last month, a senior insurance broker in his late 40s was caught on camera engaging in a sex romp with a junior almost half his age at their workplace: Marsh Ltd insurance firm in  New Zealand.

The broker, who is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, is now fighting to keep his job as a regional manager at the firm after photos of the affair went viral, according to reports.
