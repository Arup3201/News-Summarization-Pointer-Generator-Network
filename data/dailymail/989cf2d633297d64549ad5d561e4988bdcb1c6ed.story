Two joyriders whose 'cat and mouse' car chase at twice the speed limit caused the death of a young schoolgirl have both been jailed.

Leanne Burnell, 21, and her 42-year-old boyfriend Leonard Jones were speeding through Taunton, Somerset, at an average speed of 65mph when Jones lost control and overturned his Vauxhall Vectra, killing 13-year-old Amy Hofmeister.

Jones had moments earlier overtaken Burnell's Ford Focus during a 4.6 mile death race where terrified bystanders said he approached speeds of 81mph.

Joyriders: Leonard Jones, 42, and then girlfriend Leanne Burnell, 21, were speeding at an average 65mph in a 30mph Taunton road when Jones collided with teenager Amy Hofmeister

Schoolgirl Amy was killed and her friend Lucy Hawkins badly hurt in the impact which happened as they were cycling along Blackbrook Way in Taunton in June last year.

A court heard Burnell was 'egging on' Jones when the pair were seen tearing through Taunton at average speeds of 65mph.

Jones - who crash specialists calculated reached a top speed of 81mph - was heard telling a front seat passenger, 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her', as he raced after Burnell.

Jones was jailed for seven years for causing death by dangerous driving and two years concurrent for having no insurance and a licence. He was also banned from driving for seven years.

Burnell was jailed for 18 months for causing death by dangerous driving and banned from driving for two years.

She had originally denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was convicted following a four-day trial at Taunton Crown Court.

Tragic: Amy Hofmeister died after being struck by the Vauxhall Vectra of Leonard Jones in June last year

Prosecutor William Hunter told the court the pair 'used their cars as toys and the roads as a playground' in the lead-up to the deadly collision.

He said: 'She was effectively encouraging Leonard Jones to drive dangerously by egging him on smiling and smirking at him.'

Lucy Hawkins told the jury: 'There was a huge impact and I just remember coming to rest in the hedge. I looked over and saw Amy on her back in the hedge with her bike next to her.

'She was completely still and wasn't moving at all. I screamed at her and got no response.'

The chase began when Burnell sped off from a pub where she had been drinking with Jones and pals - witnesses said each had had a pint of cider.

The jury was showns CCTV footage showing Jones chasing the speeding Burnell through the town and as she turned down a no car bus lane.

Burnell was in front and Jones caught her up and overtook at 80mph - as his passenger Larry Grant told him to slow down.

Police crash specialists calculated Burnell s average speed to be 65mph while Jones was doing nearly 81mph.

Giving evidence Burnell claimed she was only doing 20-25mph and that her car was chugging as it was low on fuel and could not do more than 30mph.

She told the jury: 'His car rolled, I panicked, I was in shock.'

Sentencing them at the same court yesterday, Judge Graham Hume Jones blamed Jones for the tragedy as he jailed him for seven years and Burnell for 18 months.

He said: 'However it was not Miss Burnell that caused Mr Jones to overtake in these circumstances.

'I consider that Miss Burnell was trying to get home first and Mr Jones decided he was trying to beat her.

Amy's mother Jane Hofmeister condemned the prison terms and said she had 'not received justice'.

Mrs Hofmeister, who blames Burnell for the chase and is considering appealing to get her a longer sentence, said: 'I said right from the offset I wanted justice for Amy; justice for my daughter; she was killed and taken from me.

'I don t believe I have received justice today. So the fight will continue.

'As far as I am concerned I am going to do everything in my power to take this forward.

'Eighteen months - I don t understand. Eighteen months is five months more than it has taken to get this case to court in the first place.

'My life sentence started on June 15, 2011 at 7.30pm. I have no reduction in that. Neither does my son Benjamin or my family.'

Chief Supt Daimon Tilley, District Police Commander for Somerset, said: 'This was an unnecessary death. Amy should not have lost her life because she wore a helmet and she did everything right.'
