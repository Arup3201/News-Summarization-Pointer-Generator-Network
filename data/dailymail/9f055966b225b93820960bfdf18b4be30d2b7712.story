Hostess Brands has announced it will close the suburban Chicago bakery where the Twinkie was invented in 1930, cutting 400 jobs and shuttering a piece of American baking history.

On Wednesday, the company said it plans to close the Schiller Park bakery in October.

Hostess Brands CEO Bill Toler said the company is closing the plant as it tries to improve efficiency, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

'While the old Hostess company was in bankruptcy, many competitors took over the shelves and are tenaciously defending their business and thus we must be highly efficient and technologically advanced to compete,' he said.

Hostess filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

The plant's employees were stunned by the news, Donald Woods said. He is president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco workers and Grain Millers International Union Local 1.

'They were working like 12 hours, six days a week, and they were looking for this plant to be a part of their future,' he said, adding that the workers voted in May to rejoin the union.

They had been told the company planned to keep the plant open long term, he said.

The company said they will be providing severance packages as well as outplacement services, and the workers' union will push for employees to be relocated to other plants.

The bakery had just reopened a little over a year ago as Twinkies returned to store shelves after Hostess' bankruptcy.

At the time, Hostess brands were sold off to different buyers. Metropoulos & Co. and Apollo bought Twinkies and other Hostess cakes for $410 million.

The spongy, cream-filled snack cake was invented in Schiller Park in 1930 by a bakery manager looking for uses for idle shortcake pans.
