Read the full match report from the Australian Open men's final in Melbourne 

Andy Murray allowed himself to be mugged in this Australian Open final. He knows it, and so does Novak Djokovic.

The angry cracking of two rackets back at his chair after a cursory handshake at the net spoke more articulately than the Scot’s more measured reflections after a shattering defeat by his long-time rival.

The smashing of his implements was a way of expressing what he felt about getting distracted by Djokovic’s Oscar-contending displays of frailty.

‘I play enough matches to be able to handle that situation better,’ he admitted.

But while the wildly undulating physical demeanour of the champion is what will be remembered about this encounter, there were more prosaic reasons for the result. A continuing problem for Murray is his second serve, which still requires a protection order to be slapped on it.

He may have varied it better at this event but it is still too vulnerable.

Djokovic won 62 per cent of his second serves to Murray’s 34 per cent, but it was 15mph faster. More startlingly, the 83mph average of the Murray second delivery in the final was 10mph slower than Serena Williams and 12mph slower than Maria Sharapova managed in the women’s final.

He lacked the same ruthlessness as Djokovic, particularly in the way he allowed himself to become distracted by the drama at the other end of the court as his opponent went through his physical troughs. You see this kind of thing happening more commonly in junior tennis, one player being befuddled by another’s struggles.

More profoundly, you have to take your chances when they present themselves against the best. Murray could have won all three sets, having been 4-2 up in the first tiebreak and 2-0 up in the third set, which was the time when the hammer had to come down.

Yet in comparing him with Djokovic, we are judging him by stratospheric standards, and that should not be overlooked. Indeed, it is possible that the unfolding story of this year in men’s tennis will be whether anybody can mount a credible challenge to the 27-year-old, whose game is near impenetrable.

If there is a volunteer for the role it might turn out to be Murray, seeing the improvements that he has come up with since returning from the off-season.

Taken as a whole, his form here has been immensely encouraging, a swift turnaround after the shambolic way he ended last year with an embarrassing defeat by Roger Federer and abrupt changes in his coaching team.

He played impressively in the lead-up during some competitive exhibitions, and then showed that was no mirage in particularly outstanding performances to beat Grigor Dimitrov and Tomas Berdych. The necessary aggression was there to see.

While the 6-0 scoreline in Sunday's final set looks ugly, it was apparent that whoever won the third set could romp away with it. The damage was done then, and that is what will keep Murray awake on the flight back to London.

Coach Amelie Mauresmo’s reaction later deserves as much weight as that from scathing BBC commentators such as Pat Cash and John Lloyd. ‘It wasn’t enough, it is not yet enough,’ she said.

‘You can see Novak produced his best play at the important moments. Novak served really well — better than Andy. The two things made the difference. These are two really good weeks compared to the end of last year, but to beat Djokovic, who is superb, it is not yet enough.

‘We have already made important progress — the little things are still to be worked on. There is not a lot of frustration. It is really a step forward. There remains a big one to make and we are going to try to do it.

‘The improvement he has made since the end of last year and then the first month and first Grand Slam is really positive. We will all look back on where he has come from to where he is at now. Still there are a few steps to climb before holding a Grand Slam trophy again, but the gap is closing.’

The new rankings will back up that assertion, with Murray up from No 6 to No 4 in the world. He is in familiar company, with the trinity of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer.

But after an Australian Open that always had swirling undercurrents of acrimony, Djokovic is in a group of one right now.
