An alien signal has been picked up by astronomers.

The source of the flash of radio waves is unknown, leading to speculation that it came from a giant celestial flare, an imploding star – or maybe from an alien civilisation.

The mystery signal originated up to 5.5billion light years away, far beyond the Milky Way.

It lasted just a fraction of a second – yet may have given off as much energy in that time as the Sun does in an entire day.

A handful of these ‘fast radio bursts’ have been discovered before by sifting the through old data.

Now, scientists using a giant radio telescope in New South Wales have captured one tearing through space in real time.

John Mulchaey, of The Carnegie Observatories, in Pasadena, California, said: ‘These events are one of the biggest mysteries in the Universe. Until now, astronomers were not able to catch one of these events in the act.’

Researcher Emily Petroff said: ‘For the project we had the telescope pointed at the location where one of the previous bursts from the data sets was recorded.

‘It’s so exciting to know a similar occurrence has happened in the proximity of the first. 

'Fast radio bursts only last as long as it takes a human to blink their eye. That is what makes this discovery so exciting.’

Possible explanations for the phenomenon include giant flares from distant stars or imploding neutron stars – small, particularly dense stars.

Some may even speculate that the signal has been beamed out by an aliens in another world.

Whatever the source, identifying it is only a matter of time, The Royal Astronomical Society’s Monthly Notices says.

Miss Petroff, who made the find while studying for her PhD, said: ‘We’ve set the trap. Now we just have to wait for another burst to fall into it.’
