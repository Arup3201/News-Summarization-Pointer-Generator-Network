Two children aged 11 or under are being rushed to hospital every week over drinking, new figures today revealed.

A shocking 102 youngsters were admitted to A&E departments across England for excessive consumption of alcohol last year.

They were among 2,084 under-15s - more than five per day - to be seen at emergency units for alcohol-related reasons.

In total, 7,892 under-18s were admitted in 2012/13, according to the figures obtained by The Sun.

Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed, who unveiled the statistics, said: 'This Government is failing to tackle the availability of strong, cheap alcohol that appeals to children.'

Across all ages, 609,894 people were rushed to A&E units over drinking last year - compared to a fewer 606,061 in 2011/12.

Aged 11 and under - 102 (two per week)

Aged 15 and under - 2,084 (five per day)

Aged 18 and under - 7,892 (21 per day)

All age groups - 609,894 (1,670 per day)

Alcohol Concern branded the figures 'a disgrace', saying that 'heavily-advertised' and 'cheap' brands of alcohol were sending out the 'wrong message' to children.

'Heavily advertised brands and cheap, strong booze are the drinks of choice for vulnerable children and young people,' it said in an earlier statement.

'Alcohol advertising is linked to 
consumption, particularly in those under 18 years old, and it’s time we 
introduced robust measures which protect this group from exposure to it.

'We already know that price is a key
 factor when young people buy alcohol so we have got to stop selling 
booze at pocket money prices.'

Under current law, it is illegal for people under the age of 18 to buy alcohol in a pub, shop or elsewhere.

However, adults can legally purchase alcohol for children aged five and under to drink at home.

Earlier this year, it was revealed that children as young as four are among 
hundreds of youngsters being referred to specialist drug and alcohol 
treatment services in the UK.

Treatment
 experts said the most common reason for children to come into contact 
with alcohol is through their parents and preventative work is
 key to heading off misuse among youngsters.

The Department of Health said the number of A&E admissions among under-18s was falling, but added: 'The number of people drinking is still too high.'

A spokesman told The Sun the department is looking at introducing alcohol awareness programmes in schools to teach children about the risks of drinking.

MailOnline has contacted the Department of Health for comment.
