Time to brush: The time timer helps ensure you do a good two-minute scrub each time

We all have to do it. But sometimes we forget, and sometimes we can't be bothered.

But dental hygiene is one of the most important parts of the daily routine, and a new toothbrush tries to inject some fun to the twice-daily scrub, with a smartphone app that monitors your strokes and awards you gold stars for your ability to brush

The Beam toothbrush might be a boon to parents who are trying to get their children to brush, and it may inspire every owner to take more care of their pearls.

But be warned, if you shun your teeth too much - the device could let your dentist know you have been bunking off.

The device connects wirelessly to your phone, literally putting the 'tooth' into 'Bluetooth'.

The reluctant brusher can then time their strokes and monitor their daily progress - although be warned that the toothbrush is not electric, so you still have to do the manual brushing yourself.

The makers said: 'Today, the average person brushes their teeth for only 46 seconds, but is 50 per cent more likely to brush their teeth for a full two minutes by using just a simple timer.

'Oral care is considered patient-centered, since oral health is impacted significantly by your daily hygiene habits.

'Data from the Beam Brush is designed to raise awareness for your oral care.'

Don't forget your smartphone! The brush will automatically tell your Android or Apple phone how you are doing

Set your goal and get brushing: The app can be set for different people as well as give you targets to reach

Beam CEO Alex Frommeyer told fastcoexist.com: 'The Beam toothbrush is the first app-connected toothbrush.

'Nothing about how you brush your teeth changes at all, but what we can do while youâ€™re brushing your teeth does change.'

The brush reacts to the body's own bio-electricity when it is placed in the mouth, starting the timer.

The data is then sent to the user's phone, automatically updating the log and measuring their progress against 'brushing goals'.

Then parents - or potentially dentists - can monitor the results, and help keep you on target with the brushing.

The brush, which is taking pre-orders now, will be available in November for $50 - with a current pre-order discount of $34.

The app - which will be available separately for users who just wish to use it as a timer - is due to be released for both Android and Apple devices in the coming weeks.
