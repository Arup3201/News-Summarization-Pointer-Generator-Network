A mother handed her three-month-old baby to a stranger claiming she could not afford to feed the child along with her six other children.

The baby girl was only wearing a onesie and a thin hat when she was handed to passerby Jennifer Argo at an apartment complex in Phoenix at 7pm on Saturday night.

Phoenix police officer James Holmes told KFVS12, that the woman told Argo  she could not afford to feed or clothe her baby - and claimed that she had six other children.

Jennifer Argo told ABC15: 'I looked at my neighbor and was like 'she is not coming back…' and she didn't, and she never came back.

Argo said she later learned the woman lives nearby.

'She makes me sick, I mean I'm a mother of three, I just could never imagine handing my child off to somebody and saying 'here,' Argo said.

She said she fed the child who felt cold to her.

The 39-year-old woman said her other children were on a mountain, which led police to search nearby locations - but no other children were found.

Police eventually tracked the woman down - she was incoherent and provided differing accounts of what happened to her baby, according to police.

The baby's father told police that the mother disappeared from their apartment and when she returned she told him she given their baby to the Arizona Department of Child Safety.

The woman was taken to  an psychiatric care facility for an evaluation.

The baby was handed back to the father - there were two other children in the apartment.
