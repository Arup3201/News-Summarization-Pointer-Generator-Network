Hillary Clinton has blasted 'whining' in a tirade which appeared to be directed at a former staffer who complained that balancing a stressful job and motherhood was impossible.

In an interview with Marie Claire magazine, the Secretary of State gave a stern assessment of a recent public complaint from Anne-Marie Slaughter in which she said holding down a high pressure job in government was incompatible with being a mother.

Directly following this, was a quote saying: 'I can't stand whining. I can’t stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they’re not happy with the choices they've made.

Stop your whining: Hillary Clinton has blasted 'whining' in a tirade seeming directed at a former staffer who complained balancing stressful jobs and motherhood was not possible

'You live in a time when there are endless choices... Money certainly helps, and having that kind of financial privilege goes a long way. But you don't even have to have money for it.

'But you have to work on yourself... Do something!'

Ms Clinton came under fire after the piece, from this month's magazine, was published online yesterday, but her aides quickly came out in her defence, denying that Ms Slaughter was the particular 'whiner' the secretary of state and mother-of-one was referring to.

Instead, she was talking about the fictional
 character, Holden Caulfield, from classic novel 'The Catcher in the Rye,'
 who wasn't mentioned in the Marie Claire story.

'It's outlandish and misleading for Marie Clare to imply anything else.'

Ms Slaughter - Ms Clinton's former director of policy planning - wrote a controversial cover story for The Atlantic this summer called 'Why Women Still Can't Have It All.'

In the piece, she explained that she quit her job because she found 'juggling high-level governmental work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible'.

She went on: 'Having it all was not possible in many types of jobs, including high government office — at least not for very long.'

Ms Slaughter has now returned to an academic position at Princeton, where she worked prior to her career in government.

According to the Marie Claire article, Ms Clinton said Ms Slaughter's problem was her own and that not everyone had the same experience.

'Some women are not comfortable working at the pace and intensity you have to work at in these jobs... other women don't break a sweat,' she said.

'They have four or five, six kids. They're highly organized; they have very supportive networks.'

But in the interview, Ms Clinton emphasised that she's committed to improving the situation for women at work.

She said making workplaces 'more flexible and creative in enabling women to continue to do high-stress jobs while caring for not only children, but (also) aging parents' was a priority of the government.
