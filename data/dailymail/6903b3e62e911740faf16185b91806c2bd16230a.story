More than 200 people lined the streets in the eastern Indian district of Bettiah to watch as two monkeys wed.

Onlookers cheered as the primates arrived atop a four-wheel-drive decked out with flowers, there to honour the wedding of Ramu to his new bride Ramdulari.

The nuptials were even officiated by a local Hindu priest, who assisted the owner in choosing an auspicious day for the ceremony to be held.

Udesh Mahto, the owner of the monkeys, decided to organise the wedding after the monkeys appeared to start liking each other.

Mr Mahto bought the 13-year-old male monkey, Ramu, in Nepal.

He later bought Ramdulari, the female monkey, at a village fair.

Hundreds of peoples lined the streets, some even travelling from nearby villagers, to take part in the wedding of two monkeys in India 

The owner of the monkeys spared no expense, claiming one of the monkeys was 'like an adopted son to him' 

No expense was spared by Mr Mahto for the wedding.

'Ramu is like an adopted son to me. I wanted to marry him off after it became apparent they liked each other,' Mr Mahto told local media. 

A band was hired, wedding cards were printed and a huge feast took place to celebrate the marriage, attended by villages from neighbourhood towns who travelled to join the festivities.
