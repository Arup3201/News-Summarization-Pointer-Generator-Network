From the giant bug which made itself at home on James Rodriguez’s shoulder to Luis Suarez taking a nibble of Giorgio Chiellini, some of the World Cup’s most memorable moments have been recreated in comic illustrations.

It certainly was a tournament to remember in Brazil and there were no shortage of talking points as Germany were crowned champions on Sunday.

And now, Fishfinger - a London-based creative agency - have come up with their own take on the incidents which have made their mark on World Cup legend.

Director Jeff Salmon told Sportsmail: 'We were expecting a great World Cup and Brazil 2014 certainly didn’t disappoint.

'But with England predictably getting knocked out so early, we knew we’d have plenty of "extra-time" to create something fun.

'Whether it was the alien that landed on James Rodriguez, the Japanese fans that cleaned the stadium, or the linesman who realised that he was on TV, this was simply an amazing World Cup - and we are delighted to been able to commemorate it with these amusing interactive cartoons.’
