A taxi driver hit speeds of up to 100mph as he took two women on a hair-raising journey after they got in his car on their way to a nightclub.

Hayleigh Sillars and Lisa Archibald experienced a terrifying ride after they were picked up from Miss Archibald's house in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, by driver John Krenski in December last year.

Miss Sillars described how Krenski overtook cars at more than 90mph on dark, wet roads with 60mph speed limits as he took her and her friend to a popular nightspot eight miles away in Stirling.

Their ordeal ended when Krenski was pulled over by police, who said the 61-year-old was driving so fast the police car struggled to keep up.

The officers then gave the two women a lift to the nightclub - after lending them their hats for some backseat selfies.

Speaking at Stirling Sheriff Court, Miss Sillars said: 'I got in the car at Lisa’s house and at first everything seemed fine.

'I had concerns when he started really picking up speed on the 60mph road. He was going about 90-100mph at least.

'It was fast. We were both pretty scared. I remember Lisa pointing at the speedometer and we both saw what speed he was doing. It was between 90 and 95mph.'

Miss
 Sillars said the driver overtook cars on the main road between Alloa 
and Stirling and also on a road in Stirling heading towards Morrisons 
supermarket.

Miss Sillars said had seen no cars heading towards them when the driver 
was overtaking but two police witnesses both told the court Krenski 
overtook into oncoming traffic.

Ordeal: Miss Sillars' ordeal ended when Krenski was pulled over by police, who said the 61-year-old was driving so fast the police car struggled to keep up. She said that she had seen Krenski overtake cars at speed

She said: 'He overtook two or three cars when he was heading towards Morrisons. That’s when we saw the speedometer at 90mph. His driving was erratic when he was overtaking.'

Their journey was brought to a stop when Krenski was pulled over by the police, who spotted Krenski speeding as he crossed the busy Blackgrange Roundabout on the A907 at around 10pm on 20 December.

Special Constable Michael Robertson said: 'We observed the vehicle overtaking four vehicles into oncoming traffic. 
We had to travel in excess of 90mph to catch up with the vehicle.

'The oncoming traffic was forced to take evasive action. They were observed to pull into the near side to let him past.'

His colleague Police Constable David Reid said Krenski was driving his car 'as fast as it could go'.

Happy ending: The Facebook posts that Miss Sillards put out on the night Krenski was pulled over, telling her friends about her and Miss Archibald's ride in a police car to the Stirling nightclub

He added: 'I was driving my police vehicle at its limits to keep up with him.'

When they did catch up with Krenski, he said the reason he was speeding was because he was 'late to pick up his next fare'.

After pulling the car over, the police gave Miss Sillars and Miss Archibald a lift to Stirling nightspot Fubar and let them take a photo in the back seat.

Miss Sillars posted the selfie on her Facebook, explaining that the officers had given them their hats to pose with.

She wrote: 'Stuck in the back of a taxi which apparently isn’t a taxi. 
Whilst he gets done for his erratic driving we are getting a lift to 
Fubar in a police car!!'

She later added: 'Hahaha yes police men gave us a lift and gave us their hats to take selfies.'

First-time offender Krenski, from Alloa, gave evidence in his 
defence and claimed he was being 'picked on' by the police.

He denied driving dangerously at speeds of more than 90mph and overtaking 
cars forcing them to take evasive action, driving without a taxi 
licence, and having defects on his vehicle, but he was found guilty of all 
charges after a trial at Stirling Sheriff Court.

The driver of more than four decades said he had not broken the speed limit and had no defects on his car.

Krenski
 claimed to be operating as a 'private chauffeur' not a taxi driver but 
Sheriff William Gilchrist said he was clearly operating a private hire 
cab.

Sheriff Gilchrist banned him from driving for a year and fined him £500 yesterday.

He
 told Krenski: 'Apart from the danger to other road users you were carrying 
two passengers at the time and they were placed in danger.'
