England Lions remain on course to begin their tour of South Africa with victory after closing day two of their tour match with a Gauteng Invitation XI 307 runs ahead in Soweto.

On a day where 19 wickets fell, the tourists built on the platform they had been given by centuries from Sam Robson and Adam Lyth on Monday to move to 443 all out in their first innings.

In reply, Gauteng were dismissed for a paltry 179 inside 50 overs, with Durham seamer Mark Wood taking four for 29, and although England stuttered to 43 for three second time around, they are still firmly on top in this tour opener.

Alex Lees failed to become England's third centurion of the innings on Tuesday morning, dismissed for 85 in the second over of the day after edging Keith Dudgeon to second slip.

Jonny Bairstow batted well with the lower order, bringing up his half-century shortly before fellow Yorkshireman Adil Rashid edged behind off Nono Pongolo for 11.

Bairstow eventually retired out for 62, with five fours and a six, before England were all out for a commanding total.

Gauteng limped to 46 for four in reply as Liam Plunkett, Jack Brooks, Boyd Rankin and Wood each took a wicket.

Bradley Dial and Sizwe Masondo showed some backbone, but just as they were settling into their stride, the former was bowled by Brooks for 23 and after the tea interval the hosts' captain fell for 27 after flashing Plunkett to gully.

That left Gauteng on 104 for six and in serious arrears, but Brian Barnard and Pongolo staged a mini-recovery in the final session.

Barnard thumped Rashid over long-on twice for back-to-back sixes and crashed a four back over the bowler's head for good measure off the next delivery.

But the leg-spinner would have his revenge by bowling the batsman, who top-scored for Gauteng with 39, while Pongolo was on his way soon after for 36 when he was clean bowled by Wood, who ran through the tail with three wickets in nine balls to dismiss the hosts in 49.3 overs.

England captain Jonathan Trott had decided against an earlier follow-on to give his batsmen more practice

That left the Lions with a sizeable advantage of 264, although captain Jonathan Trott opted against the follow-on preferring to give further practice to his batsmen.

That backfired slightly as Robson was dismissed for one, while James Vince added just six before he fell to the last ball of the day.

In-between, Lyth contributed 25 from 29 balls and although he too was back in the pavilion before the close, Trott, playing in England colours for the first time since the 2013 Brisbane Ashes Test, was unbeaten on 10.
