An 18-year-old former public schoolboy who shot primary school children with a BB gun to 'let off steam' has been spared prison. 

Jack Hewitt, of Gilmerton, Edinburgh, took potshots from a window of his parents' home at children aged between eight and 10 playing in the grounds of a neighbouring primary school.

When he was arrested a tearful Hewitt told police he 'was letting off steam' during his exams.

Former public schoolboy Jack Hewitt (pictured left) has avoided prison despite admitting to shooting at primary school children with a BB gun in May 2013 - he was instead ordered to carry out community service

He admitted culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm - but today avoided jail and was instead sentenced to 200 hours community service

Hewitt has twice had his sentence deferred - once to finish his exams and another to go on a charity trip to Fiji.

During the May 2013 incident he shot at and hit a group of young children who were playing in the grounds of Gilmerton Primary School during their lunch break. 

Several of the children were hit by the pellets - one girl was struck on the forehead and another was hit just below the eye.

Others had red marks and bruising on their arms, legs, stomach and heads.   

Today, a sheriff said Hewitt had an 'uncommon fascination' with firearms and had committed a serious crime when he fired at the children in Edinburgh in 2013.

But after taking into account his previously clean record and guilty plea the judge ordered him to serve 200 hours of community service.  

Sheriff Isobella McColl ordered Hewitt to complete his community service over the next nine months.

She said: 'I would have given you the maximum of 300 hours, but because you pled guilty it will be 200 hours.'

She added Hewitt had 'an uncommon fascination, like other young people, with firearms'.

After hearing a plea from Hewitt's defence lawyer for him to be admonished - the judicial equivalent of a verbal warning - the sheriff replied: 'Admonishment is impossible due to the seriousness of the offence.'

But the father of one of children slammed the sentence and said Hewitt should have been jailed.

He said Hewitt was getting off lightly because he had attended the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in the city.

He said: 'This young man was shooting at children. If he had hit one of them in the eye it could have been life-changing for them.

'He went to a private school and I think that is the reason why he got off lightly. Anyone else would have been sentenced a long time ago and not been let off to go to Fiji.

'This was a chance to make a point about firearms but they have just let this person walk - it's ridiculous.

'He must have fired that gun loads of times which shows he had no remorse after hitting the first child.

'Since this happened we have been keeping an eye on similar cases and people have ended up in jail, which should have happened in this instance.'

Outside court, Hewitt told reporters: 'I don't want to speak.'

Scottish Conservatives previously criticised the delays in sentencing Hewitt.

Today a spokesman said: 'We feel that the sentence is appropriate.'

Former public schoolboy Hewitt was a student at the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in Edinburgh
