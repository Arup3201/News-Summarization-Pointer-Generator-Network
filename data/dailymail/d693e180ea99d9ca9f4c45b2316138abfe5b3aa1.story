Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher was memorialized as a 'humble, kind young man' at his funeral on Wednesday - despite brutally murdering the mother of his child before killing himself in front of his coaches.

Several hundred mourners gathered for the NFL linebacker's funeral near his hometown on Long Island, New York.

The 25-year-old Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, on December 1, 
then drove to the Chiefs practice facility and shot himself.

The horrific murder suicide has shaken the NFL and begun a discussion of gun ownership and mental health issues.

At least seven players have given up their guns - handing them over to the security personnel for their teams,Â Sports Illustrated reports.

At Upper Room Christian Church on Wednesday, relatives wore black - 
and red, the Chiefs' color. Pastor Dawn Mixon shared that Belcher's 
mother, Cheryl Shepherd, described him as a 'humble, kind young man.'

He
had a soft spot for children and loved cartoons, she said.

'We may not understand the reasons why we are here or understand what caused this tragedy,' Pastor Mixon said.

At a celebration of Belcher's life, there were hints of the way it ended. A photo slide show played on a large screen above the stage, with images from Belcher's childhood through his football careers at nearby West Babylon High School and the University of Maine.

Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players

At least seven NFL players have turned over their weapons in the wake of the Jovan Belcher murder-suicide, according to Sports Illustrated reporter Peter King.

The players have handed their guns over to their teams' security officers to dispose of them.

One player gave up multiple firearms and told team officials he didn't trust himself with them.

Then appeared the words 'In loving memory of' Belcher and Kasandra Perkins, the mother of his 3-month-old daughter Zoey.

After a series of pictures of Perkins and baby Zoey came the message, 'Keep this little girl in your prayers.'

'The legacy we pass on to her will be good,' said his uncle, Davin Miles.

Next to an open casket were collages of photos and mementos from Belcher's playing career. An array of flowers spelled out W.B. for his high school.

Chiefs players and staff attended a memorial service for Belcher in Kansas City last week.

On a Saturday morning, the day before the team's game against the Carolina Panthers, Belcher shot Perkins multiple times at their home. Police said Belcher and Perkins previously had been arguing.

The funeral was at Upper Room Christian Church in Dix Hills, New York, near his hometown on Long Island

Belcher then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he thanked coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli for all they'd done for him. As police arrived, Belcher slipped behind a car and put the gun to his head.

His path to becoming an NFL starter had been an unlikely one. Belcher did not play in college football's top division, and he wasn't drafted. But he made the Chiefs, becoming a full-time starter in 2010.

Bishop Stephanie Green described Belcher as 'a man who did some awesome things - while other young men his age were out hustling, slinging and doing other things, he chose an education.'
