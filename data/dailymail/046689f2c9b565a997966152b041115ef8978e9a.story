New York Giants team captain Victor Cruz suffered a hideous injury in last night's National Football League game and was taken to hospital.

Cruz, the Giants star receiver was left writhing in agony on the ground when he tore his right knee tendon in the third quarter. 

The Giants team captain left the field in tears on a cart and was taken to a Philadelphia hospital.

As he departed, he was surrounded by distressed players from both teams. He is expected to miss the remainder of the season.

Cruz was put on to a cart and taken to a Philadelphia hospital - he is expected to miss the rest of the season  

The team captain was watch on by his distressed team mates, who will now be without their star receiver

The injury is a huge blow for the Giants, as since 2011, Cruz has made the most touchdowns out of any wide receiver in the league. 

Cruz was in good spirits before last night's match 

Cruz, 27, was also a Pro Bowl pick in 2012 and is known for his salsa dance after scoring touchdowns. 

The injury happened in the third quarter as Cruz leapt for a ball. 

As the ball tipped his hands, his right leg appeared to twist and he immediately grabbed for his knee while in mid air.

The pass fell incomplete and Cruz crumpled to the ground in obvious pain.  

Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said: 'It's a huge loss. The players have a lot of respect for Victor. Everyone grieved. It wasn't a good scene.

'It was tough to say anything to him. I went there and patted him on the shoulder, but he was in some pain, and it wasn't a great opportunity, 

'Anything I would have said, he wouldn't have heard me.'

Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul said: 'At the end of the day, we are praying for him (Cruz). Hopefully he gets well, and the next person has to step up.' 

A miserable night for the Giants was compounded by the final 27-0 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.
