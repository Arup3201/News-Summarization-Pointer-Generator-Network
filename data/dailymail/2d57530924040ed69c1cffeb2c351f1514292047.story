Employers should do more to help staff going through difficult divorces to stop them quitting and ending up on benefits, Iain Duncan Smith has said.

The Work and Pensions Secretary warns that when people have problems in their private lives 'their work suffers', and after going on sick pay their employer eventually says 'bye bye'.

He wants companies to follow a German model of 'trying to engage the worker' when they have personal problems which means they risk 'crashing out of work'.

Ministers warn that 60 per cent of people who leave work with mental health problems suffer from anxiety or depression.

The government wants firms to take a more proactive approach to intervene in the lives of their staff.

By supporting workers when they are going through a family break-up or other stressful period, they are more likely to stay in work and not fall into a life on benefits.

Mr Duncan Smith said: 'What happens in private sector companies, particularly, is people suffer a problem, then their work suffers, they cease coming into work regularly, what happens is they go into their statutory sick pay and at the end of it the business sort of says "bye bye".

A pilot scheme is working to offer people on benefits with mental health problems help earlier, to get them back into work sooner.

Campaigners warn that the impact of family break-up on workers can last for a long time

Mr Duncan Smith told the Work and Pensions Select Committee: 'If you go to other countries like Germany and others they have a much more proactive process in trying to engage the worker at that point really, to find out what the problem is.

'Quite often they are really quite minor problems, they may be family problems, maybe there is family break up going on, or a hiatus or something that actually you can then deal with.

'They can be sent to some kind of help and support whether it is treatment if they are suffering some kind of mental health condition early on, stablilising them and keeping them in that job.

'So that is what we are now trying to focus our attention on is to get to people much earlier where they are work where they start to show indications of difficulty and start to get that treatment.'

'We would like to push companies even further to do more and we would like to support them to a greater degree', he added.

Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, told The Telegraph: 'Iain Duncan Smith is undoubtedly correct in recognising that employers are often among the first people to discern the tell-tale signs of failing mental and emotional health and can play a valuable role in encouraging colleagues under strain to seek medical help.

'He describes this as more proactive approach, but it is still a reaction to a problem that has already begun to manifest itself. As a society we need to be proactive at an earlier stage still.'
