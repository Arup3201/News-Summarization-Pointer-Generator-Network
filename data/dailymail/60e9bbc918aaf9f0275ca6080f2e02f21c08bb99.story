The pilot of the doomed TransAsia was still holding the joystick in the plane's cockpit when his body was found, it has been reported.

Liao Chien-tsung, 42, has been hailed as a hero for his actions in the desperate last moments before the crash that killed 35 people.

Brave Chien-tsung was praised by Taiwan's vice president for steering the plane between apartment blocks and commercial buildings before ditching the stalled aircraft in a river.

Aviation authorities also revealed today that both engines had lost power in the minutes before the crash, as grieving relatives visited the scene of the crash.

Disaster: Emergency personnel retrieve the body of a passenger who died in the TransAsia Airways Flight GE235 plane crash, killing 35 people

Devastated: Grieving relatives visited the scene of the crash as rescuers continued to search for bodies. So far, 35 people have been confirmed killed, with 15 survivors and a further eight still missing

TransAsia Flight GE235, carrying 58 passengers and crew, lurched between buildings, clipped a taxi and an overpass with one of its wings and crashed on its left side into shallow water shortly after take-off on Wednesday.

Thomas Wang, executive director of the Aviation Safety Council, said one of the engines went idle just 37 seconds after takeoff and the pilots may have shut off the remaining engine before attempting to restart them - but the plane crashed before that could happen.

Mr Wang said: 'Based on the data we have so far we can see that for a period of time both engines showed no thrust.

'The right engine flamed out and triggered a warning in the cockpit. The left engine was shut down by command and the pilot tried to restart the engine but couldn't.' 

The plane's blackbox data showed that pilot Chien-tsung issued a 'mayday' call and announced an engine flameout 35 seconds after noticing engine failure, aviation authorities have revealed.

Mr Wang added: 'The plane flashed a flameout signal for one of the two engines at 10:53:28 when the plane climbed to an altitude of 1,200 feet, triggering a warning.

'Then the other engine was shut down manually. The pilot tried to restart the engines but to no avail. That means that during the flight's final moments, neither engine had any thrust. We heard 'Mayday' at 10:54:35.'

Wang said it was 'not clear' why the left engine was shut down manually and added: 'We are not reaching any judgement yet.'

About one minute after the announced flameout, the black boxes stopped recording, the Aviation Safety Council said. A flameout can occur when the fuel supply to an engine is interrupted or when there is faulty combustion.

The bodies of Liao and his co-pilot were retrieved from the almost-new turboprop ATR 72-600's cockpit still clutching the joystick, with their legs badly broken, investigators said.

'They were still trying to save this aircraft until the last minute,' Taiwanese media quoted unidentified prosecutors involved in the crash investigation as saying. 

Taiwan's Vice President Wu Den-yih visited a funeral parlour for a prayer session to pay respects to the victims, many of whom were from mainland China, and praised the actions of pilot Chien-tsung. 

Mr Wu said: 'When it came to when it was clear his life would end, the pilot meticulously grasped the flight operating system and in the final moments he still wanted to control the plane to avoid harming residents in the housing communities.

'To the plane's crew, the victims...I express condolences.'  

It has also been revealed that a lucky family who survived the terrifying crash on Wednesday had swapped seats minutes before takeoff - a move which is likely to have saved their lives.

The Lin family are reported to have asked to be moved from the left side to the right side after the father had 'heard a noise from the wing', according to local media.

Their two-year-old son is believed to be the boy seen being pulled from the wreckage yesterday.

Mr Lin had asked to change seats to the right side before takeoff after hearing a noise coming from the wing, local newspaper United Daily said.

'He was uncomfortable after he heard the noise,' the
newspaper said.

The parents then found their son floating in the
water after the crash. Lin promptly gave his son emergency first aid before rescuers
arrived.

'Right after Lin escaped the plane, he pulled up his wife,
who was just next to him. He saw his son in the water, with face
turning pale and lips turning purple,' the newspaper said.

Wreckage: Rescuers lift part of the wreckage of TransAsia Airways plane Flight GE235 after it crash landed into a river, in New Taipei City

Search: Officials search the wreckage of the doomed flight, which authorities have revealed lost power in both engines before it crashed

Thorough: Investigators sift through the wreckage at the site in Taipei on Thursday morning

Media said it appeared the pilot had fought desperately to steer the stricken aircraft between
apartment blocks and commercial buildings close to Taipei's
Songshan airport before crashing into the river.

Dramatic pictures captured by a passing motorist showed the
plane careening over an overpass, its nose up as its port-side
wing struck the taxi and roadway just metres from passing cars.

'The pilot's immediate action saved many people,' Lin's
brother, Chris Lin, told Reuters. 

'We all feel very lucky.'

Rescue officials are still searching the wreckage for bodies. There are 15 known
survivors.

Nightfall: Rescue teams have been working through the night to find missing passengers and establish the cause of the crash

Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said 16 of
those killed were from among a group of 31 Chinese tourists,
most from the southeastern city of Xiamen. Three Chinese
passengers were rescued. 

The crash was the latest in a
string of aviation disasters in Asia in the past 12 months and
TransAsia's second in the past seven months.

The plane was bound for the Taiwan island of Kinmen, not far
from Xiamen. 

The CAA also disclosed that TransAir Airways had failed to meet around a third of the requirements it had demanded after another fatal crash just seven months ago in Taiwan's western Penghu islands.

The regulator has grounded a total of 22 ATR planes from two Taiwanese airlines for safety checks following the accident, and TransAsia has been banned from applying for new routes for one year.
