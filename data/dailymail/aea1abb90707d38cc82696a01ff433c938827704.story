Television property shows talk about 'forever homes' but not many of us are lucky enough to stay in the same house we grew up in.

Jack Haddock is one of the fortunate few - he moved to his semi-detached home in Walsall in the West Midlands at the age of one, and he is still there now, 85 years on.

And not only does the 86-year-old RAF veteran live in his parents' house, but he also uses the same appliances that they were using decades ago.

Stability: Jack Haddock has lived in the red-brick semi in Webster Road, Walsall, for 85 of his 86 years

Houses going up in Walsall in the 1920s: Mr Haddock's parents were among the first to get a council house

Mr Haddock is still listening to the old wireless that the family heard the outbreak of World War Two announced on in 1939, and the Anderson Shelter that they used to shelter in during bombing raids is still in the garden, where it now serves as a shed.

He said: 'I'm very attached to this house and I love living here.  I know lots of people in this community and would hate to move.'

Jack Haddock senior never missed a week's rent for the house, which was originally owned by Walsall Council, and nor has his son, who now pays Walsall Housing Group a little more than the seven shillings and 11p it cost his father each week.

The younger Mr Haddock, who has never married, was born half a mile away in Hospital Road but moved into the red-brick house in Webster Road in 1928 as a one-year-old baby with his parents, Jack senior and Florence.

His father worked on the trams in the 1920s and was one of the first people in Walsall to apply for a council house there.

Mr Haddock, who has no children and who keeps fit by cycling 20 miles every day, said: 'I was tempted to get married once, in the 1970s or 80s, but I had mother-in-law trouble.

The house has had additions since Mr Haddock's parents knew in, including an upstairs bathroom and new wiring

How it was: Open land in the vicinity of where Webster Road was to be built, before construction work started

Mr Haddock's house cost Walsall Council £295 to build in between the wars - it is now worth £85,000

'She and my girlfriend wanted me to move to The Delves, a few miles away, but I opted against it because I wanted to stay here.

'I cut it dead - and that was the reason.'

The house was built by Walsall Council at a cost of £295 and when Mr Haddock's father applied for it, he was told his references from the local vicar, the tramp depot and the Royal Artillery in which he had served during the World War One, were not enough - he needed a child, too.

'So I was brought into the world,' said Mr Haddock junior, 'and my parents were given a tenancy at a new council house in Webster Road.'

He has lived there ever since, apart from five years living in the south when he joined the RAF after World War Two as a driver.

He said: 'At the time we moved in, it was quite modern and state of the art, although of course we all had coal fires then and the bathroom was downstairs.

Parents: Mr Haddock's mother Florence May, left, and father Jack senior, moved into the house in 1928

Still going strong: The RAF veteran who has never married or had children, cycles 20 miles every day

'My earliest memories are of steam trains roaring past our house on the way to Ryecroft Engine Shed, which is now Mill Lane Nature Reserve.

'I was 12 at the outbreak of World War Two and I vividly remember the night time bombings.  We spent many a cold night in the Anderson shelter at the bottom of our garden, which I still use now as a shed.

'Sometimes we used to watch the German planes flying back in the moonlight over our homes, after they had carried out bombing raids in Birmingham.'

Corner shop: The grocery store Mr Haddock remembers visiting as a child is still there, now run by Moham Lao

History: Mr Haddock's parents were among the first people to apply for a Walsall council house

Mr Haddock's parents died in 1958 but he carried on living there, watching as it was gradually modernised with the addition of an upstairs bathroom, electrical rewiring in the 1980s, and a full renovation as part of the Decent Homes programme introduced in 2000.

Mr Haddock is still going to the local grocery shop he's frequented since the 1930s, when it was run by a man named Joseph Venables.

He said: 'It was an institution because he ran the shop in true Victorian fashion - everything was precise, he was always well dressed and there would be religious music playing on the radio on Sunday evenings.'

Mr Haddock’s long life at his home has now been turned into a book - ‘The Home That Jack Built’ - by Walsall Housing Group analyst Rob Hunter.
