However friendly your boss is, they’re unlikely to be the first person you’d ask about family planning.

Alas, wealthy socialite Countess Maya von Schoenburg thought otherwise.

Not only did she ban her live-in housekeeper from getting pregnant for a year, but she also told the mother-of-one she had to ask her permission if she wanted to have another child.

'Overbearing': Teresa Filipowsa, seen left outside the tribunal, was told she had to keep her employer Countess Maya Von Schoenburg, seen right in a file photo, informed of any plans to expand her family

And when Teresa Filipowska, 36, did become pregnant four years later, she was dismissed within three days.

Yesterday a tribunal ruled that the 
54-year-old countess, ex-wife of Mercedes Benz heir Mick Flick, was 
‘intrusive’ for imposing the rule.

The socialite has been ordered to pay
Miss Filipowska almost £19,000 after she successfully won a claim for 
unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and unpaid wages.

She spent four years working for the 
millionairess at her 13-acre country estate in Englefield Green, Surrey,
which was once home to Marilyn Monroe.

The judge concluded that the countess, a companion of Lord Rothschild, 
was ‘plainly annoyed and irritated’ when she learned of the pregnancy, 
and it was a factor in the housekeeper’s dismissal.

But the countess, who did not attend the hearing in Reading, Berkshire, 
claimed she was forced to make her housekeeper redundant after she was 
diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and moved back to her native Germany
for treatment.

Country residence: Parkside House, Englefield, where Ms Filipowsa was the live-in housekeeper

Miss Filipowska said: ‘Initially, I was only asked to not get pregnant 
in the first year which, despite my being entitled to, I did not.

‘The respondent continued to suggest on numerous occasions that I should discuss any family planning with her.

‘The respondent was overbearing over the time I worked there, pressuring
me not to get pregnant without first “discussing it” with her. Nobody 
should be made to sit around a table and discuss intimate family 
planning issues.’

The countess hired Miss Filipowska in May 2008. She moved into a cottage
in the grounds of Parkside House with her partner Piotr Bartosiak and 
her young child.

Miss Filipowska claims that two years later the nanny left, so she was 
given the added responsibility of looking after the countess’s daughter 
when she was away.

Miss Filipowska said the countess was often abroad for parties, adding: 
‘She is what can best be described as a socialite and has many famous 
friends.

‘As a matter of confidentiality, I do not believe that it is appropriate
to identify who these people are but it is fair to say she is friends 
with numerous high profile politicians (from the UK and America), actors
and other celebrities.’

She also hosted parties at which the housekeeper was expected to help.

Miss Filipowska explained her days could start at 8am and not finish until 3am.

‘I was expected to be ready and available for any task at the request of the respondent,’ she said.

‘The job morphed from being a housekeeper to an on-call housekeeper, 
nanny, taxi driver and came to involve Piotr, despite him never actually
being employed by the respondent.’

In November 2011 the countess moved to Italy. But the property was 
rented out to a senior banking executive, and Miss Filipowska was 
assured her job was safe.

In the summer of last year the countess moved to Germany after being 
diagnosed with cancer, but continued paying Miss Filipowska.

Family planning: Ms Filipowsa, 36, successfully sued the countess for sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal

Last autumn the housekeeper, who now lives in Addlestone, Surrey, 
discovered she was pregnant with her second child, and emailed the 
countess to tell her.

The countess replied with congratulations, but ‘suggested I ought to have discussed enlarging my family with her first’.

Three days later the countess emailed again stating she no longer needed Miss Filipowska because her circumstances had changed.

In statements to the tribunal the countess, who has recently undergone 
surgery, explained that at the time she was making plans to sell her 
home.

‘I called it an unfortunate coincidence of events that Teresa got 
pregnant exactly at the same time when I had to make her redundant,’ she
said.

Employment judge Robin Lewis said the conversations about pregnancy were
intrusions on a ‘personal and intimate matter that are no concern of an
employer’.
