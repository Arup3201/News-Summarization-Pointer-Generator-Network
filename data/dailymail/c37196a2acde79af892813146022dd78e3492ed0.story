It could just be the worst ever counterfeit - but this photocopied £20 note still managed to fool staff at one shop.

Police in Manchester revealed that the counterfeit cash had been accepted by a shop as legal currency over the Christmas and New Year period.

The fake money, which was just two colour photocopies of a £20 note loosely stapled together, is understood to have been printed on normal paper and cut to size.

The staples are clearly visible, as are white lines across the note - possibly as a result of the printing process.

It was handed in to Greater Manchester Police after being used to buy products in recent days.

Police refused to name and shame the shop that accepted the fake note. But it said that they were publicising the incident to 'raise awareness'.

The GMP City Centre Twitter feed published the photograph at around 3.30pm on Wednesday with the caption: 'Hard to believe that this was accepted as legal currency. 

'Won’t name and shame establishment to avoid embarrassment.'

It later added: 'Not naming premises! It’s a reminder for vigilance for all.'

The Bank of England's £20 note officially changed in July 2010. From July 1 of that year, only notes featuring the image of Scottish economist Adam Smith could be used.

They replaced notes featuring the image of Edward Elgar as part of a move to drive down the number of forgeries.

Meanwhile Britain's first plastic banknotes are set to enter circulation in March 2015. Two million of the £5 notes will be released by Clydesdale Bank to coincide with the anniversary of the opening of the rail bridge in east Scotland in 1890.

They will be introduced in Scotland ahead of England, where the Bank of England plans to issue them for the first time in 2016.
