Perhaps this half-witted couple had been smoking a little too much of their own stock when they decided to ring the police to report that their £10,000 cannabis farm had been stolen.

Officers easily weeded out dumb duo Colin Roberts and Mandy Coghlan who had contacted them after discovering that dozens of their own cannabis plants had been taken.

However, when police tried to arrest Roberts for producing the drug, his partner Coghlan threatened officers with an air pistol, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard.

The high life: Colin Roberts, right, and Mandy Coghlan, left, told police that their £10,000 cannabis farm had been stolen

The court was told that on arrival at Coghlan and Roberts' home on April 23, they were hit by a pungent smell of cannabis.

The pair reported that £10,000 of their belongings had been stolen - and admitted that it was in the form of cannabis plants when questioned.

Officers quickly established that the cannabis had been stolen and Roberts was arrested for production of the drug - which he took to relieve his pain from Crohn’s Disease.

The court heard that on witnessing her partner's arrest Coghlan became angry and grabbed a loaded air pistol and pointed it at one of the police officers.

The pair have been handed 12-month prison sentences, suspended for two years.

David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Coghlan appeared to be intoxicated.

'She
 became upset and left the house and found a piece of glass in the back 
yard which she held to her throat. The officers took it from her.'

After seeing her partner arrested, Coghlan then barged past an officer and went into the kitchen.

Mr
 Bennett added: 'She said something about a gun, reached in a cupboard 
and pulled out something that had the appearance of a small handgun.

'The
 officer grabbed her arm and called for help and another officer was 
able to get hold of the gun.

The two of them were able to subdue her and
 place her in handcuffs.'

The pistol-type air weapon had four pellets inside and a fifth was waiting to be fired.

Officers
 found a 'gazebo set up' in an upstairs bedroom with 16 pots with just 
stubs left as the rest of the cannabis plants had been harvested. There 
was also 46.33 grams of dry skunk cannabis.

The court was told the 
potential yield of the plants and value of the drugs left in the house 
was about £2,000.

Roberts, 
aged 47, of Bond Street, who has previous offences for drugs matters, 
including cultivation of cannabis in 2009, pleaded guilty to producing 
cannabis.

Coghlan, of the 
same address, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to 
producing cannabis and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of
 violence.

They accepted there was an element of commercial supply in the growing of the cannabis.

Joanne Wallbanks, mitigating for Roberts, asked Recorder Patrick Thompson to give her client a chance.

David Bratt, representing Coghlan, said her role in producing the cannabis was lower than Roberts. He also said that she acted on the spur of the moment with the firearm.

'It was just a foolish act of crass stupidity,' added Mr Bratt.

As well as the suspended jail terms, Roberts must complete 240 hours’ unpaid work and Coghlan must work with alcohol and drug support service Adsis for 12 sessions.
