With the promise of a superfast internet connection, it was billed as one of the biggest technology launches the UK had seen.

But less than 24 hours after the 4G wireless service became available for mobile phones in 11 cities nationwide, questions were being asked about its claims to be five times faster than the current 3G network.

Initial reviews and online comments suggested speeds were not quite as promised – while some even suggested that 3G connections had been slowed down to make the new service look quicker by comparison.

Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices

Costly: EE has come under fire for its high pricing, with experts advising consumers to wait for rival networks to launch

The 4G network is available on Apple’s
 iPhone 5 as well as devices from HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei. It was
 launched in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, 
Liverpool, London, Manchester, Sheffield and Southampton.

EE, the company behind  T-Mobile and 
Orange, launched its 4G service on Tuesday, a full six months before its
 major rivals Vodafone, O2 and Three, are able to enter the market.

Customers who sign up for a contract 
are being promised speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second 
(Mbps), as fast as the average home broadband connection.

It means that from now on they should be able to download items, watch videos and view large documents without a long wait.

But the BBC’s technology correspondent
 Rory Cellan-Jones, who was among the first to try out the new service, 
said his own experience was less impressive.

■ The new 4G network was launched in 11 UK cities and will be joined by five more before Christmas, providing coverage to over 20million people.

■ It is currently offered only by the EE network, with customers paying £36 a month upwards.

■ 4G should allow users to watch videos without them freezing, download web pages at high speed, and allow smooth video-phone calls.

■ It’s quicker than its predecessor 3G because it crams more data into the radio signals used to transmit and receive data to phones.

■ Drawbacks are that the phones will run out of power more quickly – and in areas of poor mobile reception, may not be any better than 3G.

■ Earlier this year the Government admitted that when 4G transfers to a different spectrum next year, it may interfere with the Freeview TV signal, which is on an adjacent spectrum.

■ Experts say about two million homes are likely to experience Freeview interference and the Government has set aside £180million for them to have signal filters fitted.

‘For 36 hours, I have been trying out 
4G in two cities where it has been launched by the EE network,’ he 
wrote. ‘Everywhere I’ve gone in London and Manchester, outside, indoors,
 on trains and in cars, I’ve used a speed-testing application.

‘And while I’ve seen some 
breathtakingly fast results, there has also been some worrying evidence 
that the speed and extent of the 4G network is being oversold.’

He also claimed the 4G network would not stretch as far as his West London home.

There was further criticism from EE 
customers who had not upgraded to 4G, who claimed their 3G service had 
been slow or down all week ahead of the much-anticipated launch.

One wrote on Twitter: ‘My EE has been 
slow or down all week in London. Forcing people to upgrade to 4G by 
making 3G unusable. Where the hell is [communications regulator] Ofcom?’

Another commented: ‘Is the reason my 
Orange 3G has been so terribly slow in and around Heathrow recently a 
ploy to make 4G look faster than it actually is?’

Last night, an EE spokesman insisted 
that its 3G services had not been slowed to highlight its new service, 
adding: ‘This is the fastest network roll-out of its kind anywhere in 
the world. By the time other networks finally launch their own 4G 
services, EE will have an unrivalled 4G network and will continue to 
build on this.’

Olaf Swantee, CEO of EE says today is a 'landmark day' for the firm as it launches Britain's first 4G network
