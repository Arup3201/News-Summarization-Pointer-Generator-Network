Tired but elated, Pippa Middleton was all smiles yesterday as she completed a cycling race across America – and  she credited her success to a ‘particularly comfy’ saddle.

Pippa, 30, crossed the finish line just after 3am in Annapolis, Maryland, after covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes.

The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge was  the only woman in a team of eight, which also included her brother James.

Pippa, James and the rest of the team arrived in Annapolis, Maryland, with others from the Race Across America cycle team just after 3am local time, after covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes

Family fun: The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister, 30, and their 27-year-old brother set off from Oceanside, California for their adventure last Saturday, with Pippa the only woman on the team

Soft: Pippa revealed before setting off that she would be protecting her widely appreciated bottom with plenty of special 'chamois cream', which prevents chafing. Her custom-built, £2,250 road bike also no doubt helped

Professional but patriotic look: Pippa and her team-mates rode across America in Union flag-themed lycras

They set off from California on the 
Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money 
for charity.

Asked if she had suffered saddle sores, Pippa laughed and 
said: ‘It wasn’t too bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly 
comfy saddle.

The hardest thing was the sheer endurance of it and not 
getting enough sleep. We averaged about three hours a night.

‘I found cycling at night quite intimidating. There was a few nights when we came across snakes, skunks and deer.’

She said her legs had been sore for the first few days. ‘They were a bit wobbly at first but then I got used to it,’ she added.

The gruelling test of endurance didn't seem to be taking too much of a toll on super-fit Pippa

The Route: Race Across America takes place across 12 days, with cyclists venturing from Oceanside, California to Annapolis, Maryland

Pippa
 and her team cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, 
Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania 
and Maryland. It’s been brilliant. I was talked into this by most of the
 boys, and particularly by James,’ she added.

The
 trip did not go completely to plan. Two of the team’s bikes developed 
faults and two support vehicles, including the mobile kitchen, also 
broke down.

There have been
 fatalities in the race in previous years  and Olympic legend Sir Steve 
Redgrave, who took part in 2010, broke cheekbones, ribs and a wrist 
after falling from his bike.

Pippa, 30 and James, 27, appeared upbeat about the enormous challenge ahead of them before they set off on Saturday

The 30-year-old test rides her 7.5kg bike - which was crafted with her famous posterior in mind. Lasers scanned thousands of points on her body to ensure it would be the perfect fit

Pippa is the only woman taking part in the ride, which is in aid of The Michael Matthews Foundation

Pippa
 and her team was raising money for the British Heart Foundation – which
 has appointed her as an ambassador – and The Michael Matthews 
Foundation, named after a British adventurer who died in 1999, aged 22, 
on Mount Everest.

It provides education to children who wouldn’t 
otherwise receive one.

By yesterday Pippa had raised more than £4,800.
