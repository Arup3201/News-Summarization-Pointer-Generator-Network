Tragic: Paul Millgate killed himself by jumping from a window at his Bournemouth University accommodation block

A jilted student sent his ex-girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck before leaping out of a window to his death - and police had to stop people from taking photos of his body, an inquest heard.

Paul Millgate, a Bournemouth University psychology student, jumped out of the window of his accommodation block after falling into despair when his 16-month relationship ended.

Suicide notes were found in the student's room and he had previously asked fellow residents if he should kill himself.

Mr Millgate, 20, of Crowborough, East Sussex, died of devastating multiple injuries from the fall - just days after breaking up with Aleasha Istead.

Before his death, he messaged Ms Istead saying 'my life is not worth living' before sending pictures taken from the window that he jumped from.

He had started drinking heavily in the days leading up to his death and leapt from the building while flatmates were having a party in another room.

Witnesses said his body was visible from many of the 400 flats in the halls of residence.

The windows in the building are designed to only open at a tilt.  

But an inquest at Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard that the window's lock had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully.

Coroner Mr Payne reached a verdict of suicide.

He said: 'It is my conclusion that he did deliberately take himself out of the window and sadly ended up on the ground below having jumped from the 10th floor.

'This could never have been a cry for help. He must have realised that by jumping out of there, there was only one result and that would have been his death.'

A police officer who responded to the incident spoke of her shock at having to try to stop university students taking photos, the inquest heard.

PC Emily Rowberry said she was confronted by lots of students looking out of their windows taking photos and videos of the 20-year-old's body and expressed fears they would appear on social media before his family were informed of his death. 

In a statement read out at the inquest, PC Rowberry said: 'He was pronounced dead at 00.28am.

'The location was very prominent. I was concerned for the onlookers' wellbeing and the casualty's dignity. I could see a lot of people were watching from their windows.

'I shouted for people to move away from the windows and close their curtains. I was shocked to see cameras flashing as people then took pictures and video.

'I was worried pictures might appear on social media before we had time to inform the family so I shouted again for people to go inside.'

Mr Millgate had been in a relationship with Ms Istead for a year and four months. 

She told the Bournemouth inquest: 'I asked if we could have a break but he just pestered me constantly.

Devastated after break-up: In the days leading up to his death, Mr Millgate was drinking heavily and had asked other residents in his accommodation block if he should kill himself

'The weekend before he died I told him I didn't want a relationship, I wanted to focus on my exams.

'We were both upset, he said something like "my life isn't worth living" and he had said before "if we ever break up I will kill myself" but I thought it was just words.

'He bombarded me with messages on text, Snapchat and Facebook. He sent me photos taken out of his bedroom window and one showing him with a noose round his neck.

'I thought the messages were sent for attention, he had never harmed himself before.

'I ended up blocking his number and deleting him on Facebook and Snapchat, I just tried to stay away from any interaction.'

She also contacted one of Mr Millgate's flatmates and asked them to keep an eye on him.

Wrote 'goodbye' notes: The 20-year-old psychology student left messages to his parents and to his ex-girlfriend before ending his own life

His housemate Chloe Cattermole told the inquest Mr Millgate had been drinking frequently in the days before his death but they assumed that was just his way of dealing with the relationship break-up.

Miss Cattermole discovered him at 11.30pm on April 4 last year in a drunken state and helped him to the sofa, lay him down and got him a glass of water.

When another housemate went to the kitchen 30 minutes later the lights were on and the window was open.

The inquest heard the windows were only supposed to tilt open at the top for safety but students had bought keys on the internet to override the locking system so they could fully open the window to smoke. 

Two notes were found on Mr Millgate's desk - one addressed to his parents and one to Miss Istead.

Coroner Mr Sheriff Payne said the letter to his parents was clearly a 'goodbye' note.

The inquest heard the note to Miss Isted was generally a nice letter but contained phrases that suggested his intentions, such as 'I hope what I do doesn't hinder your exams' and 'I couldn't go on being without you'.

After an inquest into the death, a verdict of suicide was recorded at Bournemouth Coroner's Court, above

Mr Payne said: 'He was upset about the end of his relationship and it's clear he had difficulty accepting it.

'No one actually perceived that he was planning to end his life. He made no declaration to his housemates and his family had been in contact with him and they did not have any serious concerns for his welfare.

'He left letters to Aleasha and his parents in a prominent position and the note to his mother and father is very much a goodbye note.'
