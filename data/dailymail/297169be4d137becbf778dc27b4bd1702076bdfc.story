An 18-year-old man has been arrested and charged for dressing up as a police officer three times to question a couple about an alleged domestic abuse case.

Max Sapirman was called upon by his girlfriend's mother, who asked him to dress as a cop and interrogate her friend's allegedly abusive husband.

He donned a navy shirt and baseball cap emblazoned with Suffolk County Police Department badges, plus a gun strap to call at the home in Deer Park, Long Island.

Both the husband and the wife, who have not been named, claim they believed him to be a bonafide officer, despite the fact that his makeshift uniform does not match that worn by the SCPD.

He arrived on the doorstep at 8.30pm on September 15 and again on September 16, ordering the husband to leave the property on both occasions for a night.

On a third visit, on September 20, he dropped by again but did not order the husband to leave, the force said in a statement. 

Each time, he asked the woman if she wanted him to arrest her husband but she declined.  

Arrested: He now faces the charge of second-degree criminal impersonation and will be arraigned on Friday

This Tuesday, more than a month later, the wife discovered Sapirman was an impostor and called 911.

He was arrested at home in Deer Park on Thursday at around 8.05pm.

He has been charged with second-degree criminal impersonation and will appear in court on Friday.

Police have also issued an appeal for anyone else that believes Sapirman contacted them to come forward.
