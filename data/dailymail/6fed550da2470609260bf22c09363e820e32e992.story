Dressed in their smartest dress uniform they came to carry the coffin of a comrade who had been killed in battle.

But stopping for a cup of tea to calm themselves before the ceremony, the six servicemen found that risking their lives overseas no longer guarantees respect back home.

After flying in from Afghanistan for the funeral of Corporal Michael Thacker, the men were refused entry to have a hot drink at a bar in Coventry. They were told anyone wearing military outfits was banned.

Yesterday, as Corporal Thacker’s widow
 revealed her horror at their treatment, the bar was subject to a fierce
 protest, with thousands vowing to stage a boycott.

And a former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan said the bar’s behaviour was ‘a direct insult’ to the dead soldier.

Corporal Thacker, 27, of 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, was shot on June 1 at an observation post in Helmand province.

On Monday, he was laid to rest at 
Coventry Cathedral, with six of his closest comrades, including his 
brother Matthew, acting as pallbearers.

After taking part in rehearsals from 
6.30am, the men broke off to go for a cup of tea at Brown’s bar before 
the ceremony – but they were told they could not enter because their 
uniforms were in breach of the dress code.

This was despite the fact they were in
 their dress uniforms – or ‘number 2s’ – complete with freshly polished 
brass buttons and pressed trousers.

It is the smartest uniform after the
 ceremonial No.1 dress and sees them wear campaign and operational 
honours medals.

Last night, 60,000 people had joined a
 Facebook group calling for a boycott of Brown’s bar this Saturday, 
which is Armed Forces Day.

Although owner Ken Brown initially 
refused to apologise, he has since said his staff were unaware of the 
funeral and the incident would not have happened if they had been.

His words follow a protest at the bar in which a brick was thrown through the window and the police called.

Corporal Thacker’s widow Catherine, 
who twice served in Iraq as an Army medic, posted a message online 
saying she was ‘horrified’ at the bar’s behaviour.

The couple married 
six years ago and have a daughter, Millie, who turns three next week.

And last night she told the Mail: 
‘It’s discrimination. You can go to Iraq for six-and-a-half months, 
leaving your family behind, without proper food or being able to wash 
but you are not accepted in your own town.

‘What they are saying is that you can protect our country, but you can’t have a drink in my bar.’

Under Forces regulations troops are 
not allowed to enter licensed premises in uniform to drink alcohol 
unless at a private function.

But there are no rules banning them 
from going into a pub or bar in combat fatigues or ceremonial dress to 
order tea, coffee or soft drinks.

Corporal David Allinson, one of the 
soldiers refused entry, described being barred. ‘They said you can’t 
come in, you’re in fatigues and we won’t serve you,’ he said. ‘What can 
you do? You just go and that was it.’

Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded 
British forces in Afghanistan, said the bar’s policy was ‘a direct 
insult’ to Corporal Thacker.

‘He gave up everything he had and 
everything he would ever have, including his wife and baby daughter, so 
that his countrymen could live in peace and security – not so that brave
 soldiers visiting his home town to pay him homage could be 
discriminated against in such a heartless way.’

And Tory MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘If 
our fighting men and women can’t be treated better than this then it is a
 shameful state of affairs.’

In his apology, Mr Brown said: ‘I 
wasn’t here and the staff dealt with the situation. Basically, we have a
 rule here that no one in uniform gets served here and the staff refused
 to serve and that’s as far as it went.

‘I can only apologise again to the 
family and anyone else that was upset... it wouldn’t have happened if 
we’d been aware of the funeral.’
