A fire crew called to treat a California man who had collapsed while mowing his lawn ensured not only that he was okay but even finished his gardening chores for him.

The Corona Fire Department’s moto is ‘serving our city with pride’ and that is certainly what they did on Wednesday morning after receiving the call for help.

The crew from Engine 1 was responding to a call about an unnamed resident who had lost consciousness while mowing his lawn.

First the responders provided advanced life support treatment to the man and ensured he was sent to hospital in an ambulance for a checkup.

But then two members of the crew stayed and finished the gardening while the man’s wife and baby prepared to go to the hospital. They even put his lawn mower back in the garage.

‘We do that a lot. We look after our community - it’s pretty tightly knit,’ Fire Departments spokeswoman Lynn Mata told KTLA.

The gardener, who hit his nose when he collapsed, is described as being ‘in pretty good shape’ after the 11 a.m. emergency response, according to Mata.

The incident follows a similar heart-warming in Bayton, Texas, at the beginning of September.

Paramedics responded to a 911 call for a man - John McCormick, 67 - who fell ill while doing his garden.

After they had taken the man to hospital firefighters returned and began to mow the lawm. When they had finished they too locked the lawnmower up in the garage.

They also left a note behind addressed to Mr McCormick's wife.

'We felt bad that your husband didn't get to finish the yard,' the firefighters said and added they would help in the future.

'We are very sorry that your husband became ill, we hope he has a speedy recovery,' they said.

'Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you out.'

Other members of the Bayton community praised the firefighters.

'All of our City employees are proud to serve the citizens of Baytown, but this is truly special,' the city said in a statement posted on Facebook.

'We couldn't be prouder of our guys from Station 4. Our prayers are with the family at this sad time.'

Sadly Mr McCormick, who had a history of heart problems, passed away two days after his heart attack.
