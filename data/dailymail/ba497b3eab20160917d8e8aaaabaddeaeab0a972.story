NBC Olympics correspondents Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski have become stars of the Sochi Games in their own right with their bold fashion choices.

And now the former Team USA figure skaters-turned-broadcasters have revealed that they took six 'car-sized' suitcases to Russia in a bid to keep viewers entertained with their quirky on-air looks.

Between them, they told Today.com, their wardrobe consists of more than one hundred items including 22 pairs of shoes, 25 blazers, four fur coats - all Mr Weir’s - six pairs of leather pants, nine designer purses and 10lbs worth of jewelry.

Eye-catching duo: NBC Olympics correspondents Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski have become stars of the Sochi Games in their own right, with their bold fashion choices

'I started pulling clothes from different designers and jewelry from different designers about a month before we came over,' 29-year-old Mr Weir, who is openly gay, said.

His sidekick, Miss Lipinski, 31, who is slightly more restrained with her clothing choices, added: 'We’re [in Russia] 
for almost a month and we’re on air almost every day, so we had to put 
together outfits ahead of time so we weren’t just bringing our whole 
closet.'

Mr Weir revealed that in total they took eight suitcases with them overseas, three of his the 'size of Ford Focuses' and three of Miss Lipinski's the 'size of Audi S4s.'

The two planned their ensembles together to make sure each one coordinated.

They have been staying in adjoining rooms in the Olympic village and several videos on Instagram show them having quick meetings before deciding what to wear.

Ready for action: Before going on air, Mr Weir has shared his high-fashion looks with fans via Instagram

The charismatic duo have been providing commentary on the figure skating section of the Winter Olympics since the beginning of February and their assignment is due to end this week.

Mr Weir said that he and Miss Lipinski wanted to dress to impress because they felt like they were 'new kids on the block' and needed to prove themselves.

They also wanted to use fashion as a way of getting more people interested in their sport.

'Figure skating needs a rejuvenation,' Mr Weir mused.

'I started pulling clothes from different designers and jewelry from different designers about a month before we came over'

His fans have also applauded him for standing out amid Russia's controversial anti-gay 
laws. The athlete came out as gay in 2011 and on New Year's Eve that year, he married his Russian-born boyfriend Victor Voronov.

'Johnny Weir's 
outfit for gold medal,' one wrote on Twitter while another added: 'Former figure 
skater/current commentator Johnny Weir is actively taunting Putin w/ his
 fabulous shirt & gold chains today.'

'REMINDER,' another added. 'You'll never be as fabulous as Johnny Weir.'

So
 far Mr Weir has donned sharp fitted suits, leather pants, sheer tops, 
ruffled shirts and gold chains finished with a perfectly curled quiff or
 a braid across his head.

And
 despite receiving a barrage of threats from animal rights activists for
 wearing fur on his costume during the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, he 
again opted for a large fur coat to battle Russia's cold.

Before going on air, he has shared his looks with his thousands of followers on his Instagram page.

He particularly caught viewers' eyes with a statement necklace and a hefty jeweled ring during commentary one weekend.

'Much respect for Johnny Weir rocking the Grandma’s Bingo Night necklace,' Twitter user Chris Gorski quipped.

'How insanely jealous do you think Kanye is of Johnny Weir's necklace right now, though,' another added.

'My favorite look was the day I did leather - a leather jacket, white tux shirt - I thought I looked slim and I felt good about it'

Before
 heading to the Olympics, Mr Weir spoke about how he was looking forward to
 taking his personal style with him for his NBC gig.

He added that he would be taking inspiration from unexpected places for his screen wardrobe.

'I decided to go more of Stanley Tucci’s character from The Hunger Games,' he told Philadelphia Magazine.

'I'm
 trying to stay between the lines of Johnny on Skating with the Stars 
and the rest of the NBC men’s family in Brooks Brothers.'

When asked about her favorite look to date, Miss Lipinski told Today: 'Our pink outfits were a lot of fun - the light pink/crazy hot pink was a great match.'

Meanwhile Mr Weir said he preferred a less feminine look. 'My favorite is the day I did leather - a leather jacket, white tux shirt, beautiful necklaces, black leather pants, and wedges.

'I thought I looked super slim and I felt good about it.'
