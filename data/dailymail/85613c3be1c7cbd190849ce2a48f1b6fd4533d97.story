Monster: David Brierley, above, repeatedly assaulted the 18-year-old victim during a 45-minute attack

A psychopath who repeatedly raped a teenage girl just four months after being released from prison for an identical attack was jailed for life today.

David Brierley, 34, repeatedly assaulted the 18-year-old victim during a 45-minute attack in Swindon town centre in February this year.

A court heard how the victim thought she was going to die and begged Brierley to stop his violent attack but he ignored her pleas and carried on the attack.

Brierley, who is 5ft 10 and weighs 19 stone had been jailed for eight years at Warwick Crown Court in 2001 for repeatedly raping and assaulting an 18-year-old girl in a Stratford upon Avon churchyard the previous year.

But had only finally been freed from prison in October 2012 after being recalled for breaching the license of that release.

Brierley had been living in Birmingham and had moved to Swindon just two days before he attacked his latest victim, the court was told.

Swindon Crown Court heard he had been living under an assumed name in the Culvery Court hostel, but on the night of the rape had was refused entry by staff who believed he had been drinking.

Tattooed Brierley had met the victim on the evening of February 23 in a takeaway in the town and bought her some food.

They were said to have exchanged telephone numbers after Brierley told her he could help her get a job.

The following evening he texted the teenager and they met up in the town centre.

He took her to an area behind some bins near John Street where he violently raped her.

Before the attack, the teenager sent a text to a former boyfriend which read: 'I'm in some trouble. He wants to take me away and do lots of bad things to me.'

She told police afterwards: 'I begged him. God knows how many times and he wouldn't let me go. I kept thinking I would die that night.'

Stephen Dent, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was to claim in interview that the girl had taken him to the area by the bins but she said he had taken her there.

'Once at the bins he asked her about her sexual preferences. She was at that point very uncomfortable and realised that she might be in trouble.

'He told police that she had initiated sex with him and he didn't use a condom because she wanted children.'

Brierley has a long criminal record dating back to his teens for offences such as robbery, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding and burglary.

He had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two offences of rape. A further charge of rape and a charge of criminal damage were ordered to lie on file.

Brierley, who has now converted to Islam, had also unsuccessfully tried to change his guilty pleas after realising that he could be jailed for life and did not want to be portrayed as a 'horrible beast'.

Nicholas O'Brien, defending, said Brierley has been diagnosed with a dangerous severe personality disorder but was not regarded by psychiatrists as mentally ill.

He said: 'My best point is that in any event the complainant was not required to go into the witness box and give evidence'

'He wishes to tell the court that he now accepts he is guilty of rape but does not accept all the details the Crown puts forward.'

Judge Douglas Field jailed Brierley for life and told him he would serve a minimum term of imprisonment of seven years and 41 days before he could be considered for parole.

The judge told Brierley: 'I have come to the view that you are a very dangerous, violent sex offender.

'In my view the risk you pose cannot be satisfactorily met by the passing of a fixed period of imprisonment.

'These offences are so serious they call for a life sentence to be passed on each count. Only when the parole board is satisfied you no longer pose a risk of further offending will you be released.'

The judge added: 'She was a vulnerable young woman of 18. In her words your behaviour became freaky. She was frightened and you told her to do as she wanted or you would punch her.

'She was crying and you told her to 'shut the f*** up' and you spat in her face. She was begging you not to rape her and she was asking you to stop.

'This was a violent incident and the physical and mental harm you have done to this woman must be profound and long lasting.'

Brierley was also placed on the sex offenders' register for life.

Detective Superintendent Nick John, head of crime investigations at Wiltshire Police, said afterwards: 'David Brierley is a violent sexual predator who has proved to be a danger to women.

'Firstly, I would like to commend the bravery of Brierley's victim who was forced to relive the details of her horrific ordeal by providing full and frank details to Wiltshire Police during this investigation.

'She has displayed the utmost courage and strength during the course of this investigation and subsequent court case.

'Brierley was convicted of a rape in 2001 and was jailed for eight years. This second incident proves he has not been rehabilitated and remains a threat to women in our society.'
