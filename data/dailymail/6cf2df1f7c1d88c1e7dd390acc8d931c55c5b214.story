Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he was 'ashamed' as he announced he was to quit Parliament.

David Cameron faces the prospect of a nightmare  by-election showdown with Nigel Farage after shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer quit last night.

The former Tory frontbencher said he would step down immediately after a sleaze inquiry ruled he should be suspended from Parliament for six months over his involvement in a lobbying scandal.

His decision will spark a Tory showdown with Ukip this summer in what is normally a safe Conservative seat in Newark, Nottinghamshire.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said last night he would ‘seriously’ consider standing himself, despite facing a Conservative majority of more than 16,000.

The seat went to Labour in 1997 during the first Tony Blair landslide but returned to the Tories in 2001.

Local Tories scotched suggestions of Boris Johnson being selected, saying they had already chosen businessman Robert Jenrick to fight the seat.

It is unlikely that a by-election would be held before next month’s European elections. Senior Conservatives privately urged Mr Mercer to serve out his term as MP rather than sparking a damaging by-election. But the bitter personal enmity between Mr Mercer and Mr Cameron meant their pleas fell on deaf ears.

In a statement last night, Mr Mercer said he was ‘ashamed’ of his behaviour. The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it.

He added: ‘No point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’

Mr Mercer resigned the Conservative 
whip last year after he was caught in a lobbying sting. He was filmed 
agreeing a £2,000-a-month contract to represent undercover reporters 
posing as lobbyists representing businesses seeking to end Fiji’s 
suspension from the Commonwealth.

Patrick Mercer spent 25 years as an 
army officer with the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, serving in 
Northern Ireland, Uganda, Bosnia and Canada.

As
 the youngest colonel since the Second World War he left the army in 
1999 and soon after joined BBC Radio 4's Today programme as their 
defence reporter.

He was 
elected as Tory MP for Newark in 2001, and served on the frontbench 
under Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron.

But he was sacked by Mr Cameron in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a
 'black b*****d' was a normal part of army life.

He also claimed to have met a lot of 'idle and useless' soldiers from ethnic minorities.

Since then, Mr Mercer has been an outspoken critic of the Tory leader. In 2011 he was reported to have called Mr Cameron 'an a***' and 'a despicable creature without any real redeeming features'.

A recording obtained by The People 
newspaper suggested he also said of the PM: 'I’ve never, ever come 
across anyone less suited to the job in my life. I would take a beggar 
off the streets and put him in that position rather than have Cameron. I
 loathe him.'

However, Mr Mercer denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge.

He is said to have tabled five 
parliamentary questions and a Commons motion on behalf of the bogus 
lobbyists after they paid him £4,000.

He
 was caught on film telling them: ‘I do not charge a great deal of money
 for these things. I would normally come out at £500 per half day,  so 
£1,000 a day.’

A Standards
 Committee on Mr Mercer’s case is due to report tomorrow. But its 
conclusion that he should face a six-month ban from Parliament leaked to
 the media last night. Mr Mercer was once seen as a rising star of the 
Conservative Party, but had a catastrophic falling out with Mr Cameron

The
 Tory leader fired him as shadow homeland security minister in 2007 
after he was reported saying he had met a lot of ‘idle and useless’ 
ethnic minority soldiers during his Army career and he claimed that 
racism was ‘part and parcel’ of Army life.

The
 sacking created a lasting enemy on the Tory benches. In 2011 Mr Mercer 
reportedly described the Prime Minister as a ‘despicable creature’. His 
decision to force a by-election is viewed by some in Tory central office
 as a final act of spite.

In
 recent years, the main parties have called by-elections as quickly as 
possible to prevent Ukip having time to gather momentum.

But
 last night Tory sources confirmed the by-election could not be held on 
the same day as the European Parliament elections on May 22. The 
earliest it can be held is May 29, but it could well slip into June.

The
 timing means the Tories will now have to fight the contest in the wake 
of the European elections, in which they are widely expected to trail 
behind Ukip.

Last night, a 
Ukip source said: ‘We are watching the situation with very close 
attention. If there is a by-election very soon after the European 
elections it would be a big deal, particularly if Ukip has given the 
Tories a bloody nose. We would want to run a serious and impressive 
candidate.’
