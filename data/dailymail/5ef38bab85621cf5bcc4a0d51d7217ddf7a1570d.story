The horrific double-murder suicide involving a pregnant woman, her young son and her father has rocked the Queensland town west of Brisbane where it all took place.

The bodies of 27-year-old Kris-Deann Sharpley, who was also heavily pregnant, and her seven-year-old son Jackson were found in the house.

A 52-year-old man, believed to be her father Derek, was also found by a female relative. The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood.

'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.'

A high-calibre weapon was found but police have not established how Jackson, discovered in a bedroom with the man, died.

His mother's body lay in the bathroom.

Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide.

'I will say that they are known to police,' he said.

'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.'

The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs.

DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 

'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. 

DI Isherwood said really close members of the family haven't been able to be contacted yet.

The person who found the bodies had to climb through a window to gain access to the house.

'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said.

'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.'

Police have been seen gathering around a brick house on the street and witnesses told The Chronicle the three people who had been found dead were related to each other.

Local businessman Paul Farmer described the home owner as 'a quiet, friendly guy'.

'He would often come into the [my] shop and book things up like milk and bread and tobacco... but he would always pay,' he said. 

Neighbours say police visited the house on a number of occasions but the family were 'well-liked'.
