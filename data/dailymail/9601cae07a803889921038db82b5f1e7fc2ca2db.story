A leading economist is to step down as executive chairman of an influential City think-tank amid drug abuse allegations.

Professor Douglas McWilliams, 63, revealed last night that he is to leave his role at the Centre for Economic and Business Research after footage emerged of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine in a north London drug den.

The think-tank, which he founded in 1992, confirmed he will take a five-month sabbatical.

Professor Douglas McWilliams - A top economist and George Osborne cheerleader - has allegedly been spotted sneaking out of a crack house in north London

Professor McWilliams, who has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, said last night he was ‘taking time off to deal with issues I have not had the chance to address fully when I have been in full-time work’.

It comes just two weeks before the launch of his book The Flat White Economy which tells how London swapped the City’s champagne and supercars lifestyle for bicycles and trendy flats.

It was confirmed last night that the CEBR board agreed on November 5 last year to allow Professor McWilliams to step down from his position as executive chairman.

A CEBR spokesman said: ‘Mr McWilliams plans to take a sabbatical and to return to full-time work at CEBR on August 1, 2015.

‘Meanwhile he plans to fulfill all speaking engagements that he has accepted.’

Referring to reports that Professor McWilliams was an adviser to George Osborne, the spokesman added that ‘neither he nor any other member of CEBR staff has spoken to or met George Osborne since he became Chancellor’, but that CEBR has ‘briefed or advised all four major political parties’.

McWilliams, 63, was reportedly seen smoking two rocks last weekend during a visit to the notorious drugs den

Witnesses had claimed that Professor McWilliams had been a regular at various drugs dens in the north London area for the past several months.

One source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Last Sunday McWilliams turned up at the den around 10pm and was there about a hour and a half. There were two rocks of the drugs. He smoked it over a table and then sat there all spaced out.

'He was in a suit and started talking about the economy and all that for about 20 minutes. He kept mentioning someone famous he worked with but didn't make much sense. He was asked if he wanted any more and said "I've had too much".'

McWilliams refused to discuss the allegations when approached by journalists from the Sunday Mirror and has been contacted for comment by MailOnline.

Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College, McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'.

The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR's clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.'

On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about 'illegal drugs'

It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.'

McWilliams, married to wife Ianthe for 35 years, has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget.

He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.'

In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world's fifth largest economy.

The growth in Britain's national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries.
