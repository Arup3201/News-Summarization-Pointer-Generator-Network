Every one of the former co-hosts came back to The View this morning as part of the official send off for Barbara Walters.

The all-female cast was reunited in a way they'd never been before with every co-host from the show's 17 seasons joined together at an extra large table.

Walters and current hosts Jenny McCarthy, Whoopi Golberg and Sherri Shepherd were joined by former hosts Joy Behar, Lisa Ling, Meredith Vieira, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Debbie Matenopoulos, Star Jones and Rosie O'Donnell.

Reunion shot: All 11 co-hosts of The View were on hand for Barbara Walter's penultimate episode on Thursday

Long time coming: Barbara Walters announced last year that she would be retiring from broadcasting this spring, and tomorrow will be her final day on the program that she created 17 years ago

'This is like the Last Supper with Barbara as Jesus,' O'Donnell joked.

The reunion, dubbed 'DejaView', comes on Walter's penultimute show with her final send off scheduled for tomorrow.

In true View fashion, each of the women took turns going through their favorite memory of working with Barbara.

Clips of Walters dressed as Marilyn Monroe for a Halloween episode and the Emmy Award-winning journalist struggling to drive a golf cart punctuated the show with some of the lighter moments.

Familiar faces: An extra large table was brought in to accommodate the 11 co-hosts

Some hosts, however, couldn't help but get overcome by the emotion of the moment.

Debbie Matenopoulos, who was one of the original cast members and started on the show when she was just 22-years-old in 1997, got choked up while talking about how Walters made her feel confident during the casting call where she was the TV neophyte in a room full of famous women who were auditioning. 

Matenopoulos was on the show for two years before leaving. She now is married to her second husband and is pregnant, with a due date later this year.

Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who was the most recent co-host to leave the show after being offered a spot as a co-anchor on Fox and Friends, praised Walters for helping to teach her the ropes of morning television.

Going for it: Meredith Vieira greeted her longtime colleague with a big kiss on the lips, playing off a joke from her time on the air when she pulled the same move

Leading ladies: Walters was a Today Show host years before launching The View and Vieira later left The View to take on The Today Show role

Backstage: The co-hosts were sharing pictures over their Twitter feeds throughout the program

Back in the habit: Star Jones, who was on the show for more than eight years, shared impromptu photos with her former co-hosts Debbie Matenopoulos (left), Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck (right)

Old clips of Hasselbeck announcing her pregnancies and introducing her children to the world while working on the show for nearly ten years were played back on Thursday.

Of the seven cohosts who returned for the special, Hasselbeck is the only one currently working in front of the camera on a daily basis. Lisa Ling also hosts a documentary series on Oprah Winfrey's network, but Meredith Vieira is due to make a return to television as well. 

Vieira left The View after nine years and went on to co-anchor The Today Show following Katie Couric's departure in 2006.

She later retired from morning broadcasting to spend more time with her family and her husband Richard, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, but is due to launch her own afternoon talk show this fall.

'I think the best thing about The View is that the public got to see the other side of Barbara because everyone knows her as the journalist but you got see how she's so funny and full of spunk,' Vieira said of Walters on Thursday.

Through the years: The View was launched in 1997 by Barbara Walters and her co-producer with original hosts (left to right) Star Jones, Joy Behar, Meredith Vieira and Debbie Matenopoulos

Personal lives: Elisabeth Hasselbeck (center) said that her favorite moment on the show was when Walters helped her announce her first pregnancy in 2004

Hot topics: Political discussions often turned controversial, especially when famously liberal Rosie O'Donnell (left) and Hasselbeck (right), a conservative, were on the show at the same time (pictured n 2006)

Much of the talk show, which was launched by Walters in 1997 as a way for women of different generations and viewpoints to connect, was based on the personalities and lives of the hosts themselves, so the reunion special served as a type of update on the co-hosts past.

Joy Behar shared a picture of her 3-year-old grandson and Lisa Ling, who left the show in 2003, talked about her newborn daughter.

Ling said the best advice she ever received from the pioneering female journalist was to not forget about her personal life, and, like a concerned grandmother, Walters jumped right in by saying: 'I thought you'd never get married!'

Taking turns: Hasselbeck and O'Donnell got in an infamous on-air fight in 2007 but have clearly move past it as O'Donnell joked that the thing she missed most about the show was 'fighting with this skinny one'

Thankful: Walters, seen reaching over Lisa Ling to hold Hasselbeck's hand, said that she stays in touch with the Fox and Friends co-anchor with regular emails

Original cast: Vieira, Star Jones (center), Debbie Matenopoulous (speaking) and Joy Behar (right) were four of the original five cast members

'Your best advice that you ever gave me was "don't neglect your personal life,"' Ling said.

This was not Rosie O'Donnell's only recent visit to the show, as she came and spoke about her recent heart attack in February to raise awareness for the importance of heart health.

During today's visit, the comedian was seated next to Hasselbeck who was her political sparring partner while they were on the show at the same time.

Though some of their arguments got infamously heated, they've apparently moved into to stage where they are able to laugh about it all, because When O'Donnell was asked what she missed most about the program, she said: 'Fighting with this skinny one right here!'

Friday's show was teased as a 'historic event' and a full line up of surprises is scheduled for Walters' final send off. 

Twitter postings from other female journalists, including The Today Show's Hoda Kotb, show that a collection of women from across network lines went to The View set on Thursday afternoon for a special segment of the show that will be aired on Friday.

The Twitter pictures show journalists past and present, but other reports announced that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is also expected to be a guest on Walters' final show.

Preview of things to come: Walters' final episode was taped on Thursday afternoon but will air on Friday, and The Today Show's Hoda Kotb showed a sneak peak of the surprise guests
