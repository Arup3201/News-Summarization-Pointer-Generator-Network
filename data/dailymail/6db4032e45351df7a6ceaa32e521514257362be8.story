Nico Rosberg has denied Lewis Hamilton’s accusation that he had bragged about deliberately crashing into him at Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, saying his recollection of their chat was ‘very different’.

While Rosberg made his first reaction to his title rival’s claims, the Mercedes management were busily applying sticking plaster to their battered team and their conficting stories in an attempt —probably successful —– to avoid punishment for the incident.

Rosberg and Mercedes were all responding to the most explosive moment of the 2014 Formula One world championship. It took place over two floors of the Mercedes motorhome — the glistening, portable team hospitality area — in the Spa paddock an hour-and-a-half after the race.

On the ground floor, Nico Rosberg was briefing the press.

Simultaneously, on the first floor, Lewis Hamilton was... briefing the press.

Rosberg, unsmiling but composed, described their second lap crash as a ‘racing incident’, while Hamilton, careworn and emotional, revealed Rosberg told him in a meeting minutes before that he had deliberately caused the accident which ended the British driver’s race. 

Rosberg finished second to extend his championship lead over Hamilton to 29 points.

Responding to Hamilton’s claims in what he described as one of ‘the more difficult’ of his regular video blogs released late on Monday afternoon, Rosberg said: ‘I have been told what Lewis said in the press and the way he has stated his version of events.

‘My view of events is very different. But it is better that I don’t now give all the details of my opinion. I hope you respect that. I prefer to keep it internal.’

A Mercedes spokesman said their drivers will take part in a sponsor event in Stuttgart on Wednesday as planned. They are expected to see each other briefly.

But back to Spa on Sunday night. Moments after Hamilton made his claim, a Mercedes insider confirmed his recall of Rosberg’s admission as ‘broadly correct’.

However, in an attempt to defuse the situation before the governing FIA might have become involved, Mercedes changed tack.

Their new, refined position was outlined in private briefings and summed up in the on-the-record words of Toto Wolff, the de facto team principal, who said: ‘They agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion, but it wasn’t deliberately crashing. That is nonsense.

‘Nico felt he needed to hold his line. He needed to make a point. He thought it was for Lewis to leave him space and that Lewis didn’t leave him space.

It was deliberately taking into account that if Lewis moved it could end up in a crash.’ As of last night, the FIA had not formally asked Mercedes for an explanation. If they intervene at all it will be low-key and private, in keeping with the style of FIA president Jean Todt.

That contrasts sharply with the previous regime of Max Mosley. Under his aegis, the FIA would doubtless by now have written to Mercedes demanding an explanation of Hamilton’s claims.

The FIA were heavily involved in 2007 when Hamilton and Fernando Alonso fought for the title, only to lose to Kimi Raikkonen.

One incident that year was similar to the upstairs-downstairs press conferences in Spa. It came when Hamilton and Alonso sat in front of the media minutes after the Spaniard had prevented his team-mate from doing a final qualifying lap at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton was a ball of fury. Alonso ate a pear feverishly.

That rivalry ended — amid the wider furore of Spygate — in Alonso leaving McLaren. So how can Mercedes cope with their troublesome twosome?

It appears to be a near helpless situation. Too much enmity has built up through a season of niggle — arguably because of a lack of firmness from, and respect for, the Mercedes bosses. Evidently, their drivers ignore instructions.

Wolff has said he will think what censure they can impose on their drivers in future. But will they really listen? It seems likely to be a dirty fight of mutual distrust up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, with only self-preservation governing the pair.

And I suspect that when the season ends, one of them — probably the loser — will seek a new team.

Upset: Hamilton was visibly shaken after a meeting with Rosberg, who is claimed to have admitted guilt

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second.

May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. 

May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. 

August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.
