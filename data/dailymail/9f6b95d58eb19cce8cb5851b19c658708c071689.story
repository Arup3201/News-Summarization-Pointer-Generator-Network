Tracked: Anthea Orchard, 35, discovered a GPS tracker device on her car while signed off sick from her job with the fire service

A 999 operator who was on sick leave from the fire service found a GPS tracker planted on her car by a private detective hired by her bosses.

Mother-of-two Anthea Orchard, 35, discovered the device after neighbours told her they had seen men acting suspiciously outside her home in Bradford.

Mrs Orchard, who had been signed off work at West Yorkshire Fire Service due to stress and hyperthyroidism, has hit out at her former employers for using public money to employ somebody to 'infringe on my family life'.

The call centre worker - who has since left the service with an £11,000 pay-off - said her bosses had suspected her of turning her hobby of balloon-making into a business while she was on sick leave.

Mrs Orchard said she became convinced she was being watched when she began to receive telephone calls at home from people asking her to do work for them.

She added that men had been spotted hiding in cars outside her house.

'I was getting phone calls from people trying to get me to take on work,' said Mrs Orchard, who lives her her husband Gareth, daughter Ashleigh, five and son Haydn, two.

'I'd told them I couldn't because I was signed off work.

'The number hadn't been withheld and when I looked it up it was for a private investigator,' she said.

Mrs Orchard, who has since left West Yorkshire Fire Service with an £11,000 pay-off, then discovered the tracker device hidden on her car.

'This is an infringement into my family life,' she said.

'The whole situation has made me very ill. It is not right that public money is being used in this way.

'The car is in my name, but it was also used by my husband.

'One of my children was just a baby when this surveillance started,' she said.

'Since then I’ve spent £300 on installing blinds on my windows.

'It was horrible to think someone was watching us.

'When I saw a man laid down in the car near my house, I never felt so scared in all my life.'

'Scared': Mrs Orchard, from Halifax, says the fire service hired a private detective who planted the tracking device on her car

'Extreme case': Mrs Orchard has now left the fire service after reaching a 'compromise agreement' with her former employers

Mrs Orchard started working on a potential balloon decorating business last June while on maternity leave.

While on maternity leave she developed hypothyroidism - which affected her cognitive functions - and she was advised by a doctor not to work long hours or night shifts.

'In my spare time I was doing the balloon stuff, it wasn't using up much of my concentration and energy and I enjoyed doing it and meeting people,' Mrs Orchard said.

When she went back to work in October last year she needed to ask permission from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue to carry out secondary employment, but hadn't dealt with it after two weeks of being back at her desk.

Several days later she said she was taken in to a room and handed a letter saying she was under investigation.

On October 31, she signed off sick due to stress at work, depression and her recently diagnosed condition.

She said: 'As soon as I booked sick, I refrained from work. My husband took over the reins of the simple stuff but I didn't work with the balloons. I took the website down and didn't think of doing any more.'

Mrs Orchard was exonerated by the probe but complained to her bosses and contacted the Fire Brigades Union.

She has now left her job after signing a 'compromise agreement' in which she agreed not to take the service to court for human rights violations over 'unnecessary surveillance or invasion into privacy and family life'.

In a separate letter, Mrs Orchard was told this clause was added to the service’s usual wording due to the 'specific circumstances' of her case.

Mrs Orchard said she was advised by the Fire Brigades Union to check her car.

She said: 'Straight away I could see it wasn't right. When I tried unlocking the towbar it wouldn't come away from the bumper, so I had to pull it and that's when the tracker fell down.

'It was a PVC pouch with a sim card inside, stronghold magnets to hold it to the chassis of the car and a heavy duty battery. The unit is locked so we removed the sim card to deactivate it.'

David Williams, West Yorkshire secretary at the Fire Brigades Union, said: 'This is an extreme case.

'It’s sad that they go to all that trouble and expense to see if someone is working on their days off.

'It’s a shame they feel they have to stoop to this level. It’s not great when they are spying on their own employees.'

Mrs Orchard’s Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: 'I’m generally for intelligence-led investigations. If groups like the Department of Works and Pensions didn’t do this people would be asking why.

'If it is done well then it can work, but it shouldn’t be used whenever someone is off sick.'

Mrs Orchard has also contacted Carrie Austin, of private investigation firm Local PI, who confirmed to her that one of its agents fitted the GPS tracker to her car, and even asked her for its return.

West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue Service today refused to comment.
