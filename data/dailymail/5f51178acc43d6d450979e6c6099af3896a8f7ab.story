A benefits cheat who claimed she couldn't walk without crutches but was filmed zooming down a waterslide on a luxury holiday was today ordered to sell her house to pay back money.

Mother-of-two Tina Attanasio, 51, from Cardiff, was ordered to pay back £16,000 after blowing cash on holidays despite claiming she could barely walk.

She was caught out by her own family holiday
 videos showing her splashing around in her swimwear on a holiday in the
 South of France.

And in the water we go! A judge at Cardiff Crown Court jailed Attanaiso for 10 weeks in December and today ordered her to pay back £16,000 through the sale of her home

Her fraud was uncovered when a former lover gave the film to benefits investigators after the couple split up.

Attanasio admitted wrongly claiming £19,000 of disability living allowance and was ordered to repay £16,403. She was told by a judge she had six months to hand over the money.

'Too weak to walk': Benefits cheat Tina Attanasio outside Cardiff Crown Court last year where she pleaded guilty to fraud

The court heard she would get the money from the sale of a house.

Cardiff Crown Court saw footage of Attanasio enjoying an action packed motor home holiday at the time she was getting top-rate disability benefits.

It showed her climbing cobbled hills, bounding down steep steps and strolling on the beach.

She was also filmed in a bright red bikini happily sliding down a steep flume in a water park.

It also showed her easily climbing out of the swimming pool during the Mediterranean break.

The court heard how Attanasio had claimed she was 'too weak to walk any significant distance' without crutches.

Prosecutor Nicholas Gedge said: 'You claimed you needed help and assistance walking, getting in and out of bed, going to to the toilet and bathing.

'You said you could only walk 10 metres before feeling serve discomfort and said it would take you three minutes to do this.

'But these videos show you walking unaided, climbing up steep steps and using water slides.'

Attanasio, of Whitchurch, Cardiff, pleaded guilty to fraudulently benefits between August 2005 and February 2010.

She was jailed for 10 weeks in December last year, but brought back to court yesterday for a Proceeds of Crime Hearing.

She will have to pay back the money from the sale of her house.

Jennet Treharne, defending, said: 'She did have good days and the video took place in a climate which was warmer.

'Her back disability was significantly improved on that holiday in the South of France.'

'Tina has good and bad days and the videos were clearly taken on good days when the hot weather eased the pain in her back.'

After the case last year DWP Minister for 
Welfare Reform Lord Freud said: 'It’s cases like these that show us why 
welfare reform is needed.

'We have a duty to the taxpayer to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.

'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable.

'It
 is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals at
 the front line and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less
 open to abuse.'
