It was certainly a respectable defence from a champion who enjoyed his victory as much as any of his illustrious predecessors.

If Phil Mickelson could not quite muster the game needed to retain the Claret Jug, the fact that he did more than just hang around for four days – almost cracking the top 20 – meant a great deal.

As for how it felt to be leaving Hoylake knowing that someone else had just taken his crown? Well, in true Californian style, the ultra-positive Mickelson merely sees it as the ideal motivation to reclaim the title he values so dearly – when The Open returns to the Home of Golf in 12 months’ time.

Asked for the exact location of the empty spot where the trophy had spent the last year, Mickelson laughed as he said: ‘My heart … Yeah, I just kind of carried it around.

‘It is hard to leave here without it. 
But it’s a good motivating factor for me, knowing how great it felt to 
win this tournament – and makes me want to work harder and get ready and
 prepared for St. Andrews next year.

‘I
 can’t think of a better site or golf course to win any tournament ever 
than St Andrews. And to have The Open back is a great opportunity. And 
I’ll be working hard to try to get it back.’

Revealing
 the details of a conversation with R&A chief executive Peter Dawson
 at the back of the 18th green on Sunday, Lefty said: ‘He was just 
thanking me - and I was thanking him for a great year. We’ve been in 
touch a lot this year and he’s been terrific.

‘He’s done such a great job with the R&A. And it’s been fun representing him, the R&A and The Open Championship.

‘Coming
 here, I played about as well as I could. I didn’t score quite as well 
as I could, but I played about as well as I could. In looking at the 
lead going into today’s round, from the way that I teed off on Thursday 
and Friday, I was only a few shots off the lead. And I think that shows 
that my game is not far off.

‘To win this tournament you need to not only play great golf, but you need to have a few breaks and you need to have luck.’

Under the weather: Mickelson did not do enough over his four rounds to challenge the leaderboard

While
 Mickelson, who shot a 68 to finish five-under and tied 23rd for the 
tournament, hopes to mount another challenge next summer in the Kingdom 
of Fife, the achievement of Rory McIlroy in winning his third major 
has some predicting a new era of domination by the young 
Northern Irishman.

Cautioning
 against getting carried away, the 44-year-old said: ‘Well, you never 
can discount it - we used to say there will never be another Nicklaus, 
and then along came Tiger. You never want to discount the possibility of
 someone coming along and dominating.

‘But
 nobody has really asserted themselves week in and week out the way 
Tiger did for such a long period of time. We’ll have great performances,
 like Rory this week. Like Martin Kaymer at the U.S. Open, and so forth.
 But it’s very hard to do that week in and week out the way Tiger did. 
That’s why it was so impressive what he did.’

All smiles: He has vowed to return better next year for The Open at St Andrews
