Joanne Hatton, pictured with her first daughter Amelia, died after a catalogue of errors at Darlington Memorial Hospital

A mother died after she failed to receive an 'urgent' blood transfusion for two hours after giving birth, an inquest was told.

Joanne Hatton lost two litres of blood as she gave birth to twins by Caesarean section at Darlington Memorial Hospital.

But the hospital staff's failure to give the transfusion triggered a catalogue of errors as her condition worsened, the inquest at Newcastle Coroner's Court heard.

Despite suffering kidney failure and liver problems after the birth, no one linked her deterioration with the blood loss, her husband, Julian, told the hearing.

The 38-year-old legal adviser only got to spend one day with her newborn sons Ben and Miles before she became seriously ill.

County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust has since accepted responsibility for the failings.

Mr Hatton, 44, told Newcastle Coroners' Court doctors and midwives who were dealing with his wife did not communicate properly and that no one person was in charge of her care.

He said the hospital had 
underestimated his wife's blood loss after she haemorrhaged heavily 
following the birth of her sons on December 30 2008.

Dr Ahmed Ali, who has since retired, told
the hearing that he had called for an urgent blood transfusion but that
when he returned two hours later it had still not taken place.

Mr Hatton later said: 'It was just like a domino effect.

'Joanne's
medical condition spiralled out of control after the delivery of the 
babies and nothing could be done to prevent her deteriorating 
condition.'

The inquest 
also heard claims that Mrs Hatton, of Darlington, County Durham, was 
sent to the hospital's high dependency unit, rather than the intensive 
care ward, because of a shortage of beds.

Mr
Hatton said he was told at a meeting with the medical director of 
County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust that his wife was sent
to the high dependency unit rather than the intensive treatment unit 
because of a lack of beds.

At the same meeting, on April 17 2009,
he said he was also told that the two units did not communicate 
effectively about Mrs Hatton's treatment.

He
added: ‘Joanne's condition following the birth of our twins 
deteriorated and nobody appeared to link that deterioration with the 
significant amount of blood that she lost in theatre and when she was 
being tended to by the midwives. 

‘First it was believed she had kidney problems and that these were separate problems not linked to her blood loss.

‘Then the same happened when next it was determined that she had liver problems.

'Again, it was like nobody linked her deterioration with her significant blood loss. Nobody appeared to be talking to each other. 

‘There was a distinct lack of involvement from the maternity unit, which I found very strange at the time. 

On January 2, Mrs Hatton's family were told by a consultant that her kidneys had recovered and that she would be transferred back onto a general ward a few days later. 

However, doctors then became concerned about problems with her liver.  Mr Hatton received a phone call at 12.30am on January 4, telling him his wife was to be transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle. 

After ten days of being brought in and out of sedation, Mrs Hatton died on January 20. 

Only days before the coroner's hearing, County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust accepted responsibility for the tragedy. 

The hospital trust said it had made a number of improvements to the high dependency unit and intensive care services. 

The inquest continues.
