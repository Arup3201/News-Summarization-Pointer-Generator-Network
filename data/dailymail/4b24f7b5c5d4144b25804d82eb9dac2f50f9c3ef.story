The morbidly obese woman who became known as the 'Half-Ton Killer' has revealed why she falsely confessed to the murder of her toddler nephew.

In a new trailer for TLC special Half-Ton Killer: Transformed, 33-year-old Mayra Rosales' lawyer Sergio Valdez visits her in the hospital and tells her: 'You know, all of this was brought 
upon because you wanted to take the blame.'

'She's my sister,' Mayra says of why she took the fall for the crime. 'And it hurts to know that she's there,' she adds while choking back tears, referring to her sister Jaime's current 15-year prison sentence for abusing her child.

Protective sibling: Mayra Rosales, who became known as the 'Half-Ton Killer', has revealed why she falsely confessed to the murder of her toddler nephew to cover for her sister Jaime

Consolation: 'I know she was your sister, and I know it was a hard decision,' says her lawyer Sergio Valdez in an upcoming TV special, holding her hand to comfort her as she lies in a hospital bed

'I know she 
was your sister, and I know it was a hard decision,' says her lawyer, holding her hand to comfort her as she lies in a hospital bed.

He adds that his next step to help Mayra - who weighed 1,000 pounds at her heaviest - is to get her criminal record expunged of the false murder charges.

In 2008, Mayra rose to fame when she confessed to the murder of her two-year-old nephew Eliseo, claiming that she accidentally rolled on top of him and smothered him with her 1,000-pound body.

She was acquitted in 2011, however, after evidence concluded that the boy had multiple injuries to his skull that were not indicative of being smothered.

Transformation: Mayra, once the world's heaviest woman, has lost a staggering 600lbs in the five years since she shot to fame as the 'Half-Ton Killer' (pictured at her heaviest weight of 1,000lbs)

Then and now: She displays a much slimmer figure in a number of recent Facebook selfies, and she revealed to ABC News on Monday that she currently weighs about 200lbs

Today: The upcoming TV special, which airs tonight at 9pm, reveals how Mayra's life has changed since the murder trial that rocked her life

At the time, Mr Valdez told the court: 'It would have required her to have to swing her arm to strike the child on the head but she could never move her arm in that manner.'

Mayra then testified that she witnessed her sister Jaime using a brush to hit her son Eliseo repeatedly on his arms, legs and head.

'I thought I was dying anyway so I decided to admit that I'd done it to protect my sister because I love her,' she told the court.

Not guilty: Mayra was acquitted of murder in 2011 after evidence concluded that the boy had multiple injuries to his skull that were not indicative of being smothered. Her sister Jaime was later found guilty

Emergency: In another trailer for the TV special, Mayra is wheeled out of her home and transported to hospital in a U-Haul because she is too big for an ambulance

Since then, Mayra has embarked on a grueling endeavor to lose weight with the help of diet, exercise and surgery, so she can be fit enough to adopt and look after her sister's three surviving children.

But despite the fact that she had lost an incredible 400lbs at the time this scene in the episode was filmed, Mayra can't help tearing up when she thinks about what her sister is going through.

In the clip, Mr Valdez tries to reassure her, saying: 'You know what? You were 
going to die in there. You live, you get the medical attention you need,
 and everybody moves on.'

Mayra nods as he continues: 'The kids are fine with grandma, and you will be
 much better.'

Mr Vandez reaches in for a hug, and Mayra whispers: 'Thank you.'

Support: Mayra gives her and lawyer a triumphant high five to demonstrate her improved mobility

Mayra tips the scale at 600lbs in the
 episode, but recent pictures on her Facebook page show just how 
dramatic her weight loss is today.

Indeed,
 the former 'fattest woman in the world' displays a much slimmer figure 
in a number of selfies, and she revealed to ABC News on Monday that she 
currently weighs about 200lbs.

The
 upcoming TV special, which airs tonight at 9pm, reveals how Mayra's 
life has changed since the murder trial that rocked her life.

Real criminal: Mayra's sister Jaime (pictured) was found guilty of causing injury to her own child, and is currently serving a 15-year sentence

Taking the blame: 'I thought I was dying anyway so I decided to admit that I'd done it to protect my sister because I love her,' Mayra said of confessing to the murder of her nephew Eliseo (pictured)

In it, she will explain that her effort to get fit has mostly been driven by her desire to take care of her nieces and nephews.

'They were the first to know when I was able to stand up for the first time, and then when they saw me walking, they saw me walk in the door, they were very excited,' she told ABC News.

'They are my motivation.'
