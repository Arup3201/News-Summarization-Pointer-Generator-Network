Duncan Ferguson was involved in a motorway pile up when an Audi crashed into the back of his £18,000 BMW today, but refused to go to hospital

He is known for his hard-man reputation both on and off the pitch.

So imagine what this motorist must have felt when they crashed into the rear of an £18,000 BMW only to find former Everton striker Duncan Ferguson behind the wheel.

The 43-year-old was driving on the M57, where it becomes the Knowsley Expressway, near Liverpool this morning when an Audi A3 struck the back of the blue BMW 1 series he was driving.

The white Audi A3 convertible, worth around £25,000, was badly damaged in the pile up, which happened at around 7.30am, with its front bonnet left crumpled.

The extent of the damage done to the BMW is unknown.

Neither driver is thought to have sustained serious injuries, and true to his hard-man image Ferguson is believed to have refused to go to hospital for treatment.

Ferguson, who is now a first team coach at Everton, is believed to have been driving a company car belonging to the club at the time of the crash.

The crash caused long tailbacks as rush hour got underway, and drivers were advised to find another route.

Ferguson, who won seven caps for Scotland during his career, spent ten years at Everton as a player  in two spells, from 1994 until 2006, with a short spell at Newcastle in the middle.

He was even touted as a potential successor to former boss David Moyes when he left for his ill-fated role at Manchester United in 2013, but the job eventually went to current incumbent Roberto Martinez. 

Police and the Highways Agency confirmed that the crash had happened at around 7.30am. It was deemed to be a minor incident and no arrests were made. 

Everton Football Club has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Ferguson confronts referee Steve Bennett in 2004

Although he scored more goals than any other Scottish player in the FA Premier League, finding the net 68 times, Duncan Ferguson also racked up nine red cards, and a three-month prison sentence for assault after headbutting another player during a game.

While playing for Rangers in 1994, Ferguson headbutted Raith Rovers striker John McStay.

Referee Kenny Clark did not book Ferguson over the incident, telling Rovers players he had not seen it, but Ferguson but was subsequently charged with assault.

He was sentenced to three months in prison in 1995, by which time he had left Rangers for Everton. He served 44 days. 

In 2001, Ferguson confronted two intruders who had broken into his home, managing to detain one - Barry Dawson - until police arrived. 

Two years later, Ferguson confronted another burglar at his home, who subsequently spent two days in hospital.

Carl Bishop, who was jailed for four years in 2003, had complained that he had been assaulted by Ferguson, but this was dismissed by police.
