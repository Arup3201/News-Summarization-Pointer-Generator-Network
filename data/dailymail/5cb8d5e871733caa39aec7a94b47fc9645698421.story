It's always nice, and brave on their part, for hotel staff to tell guests on arrival that they will try and deal with any requests they may have.

An extra towel, having an ironing board sent to your room, and replacement toilet rolls are easy enough to arrange.

But how about getting a llama to run amok in the hotel or allowing 6ft long monitor lizard in the room?

It seems there is nothing concierges at these hotels won't do to make a guest's stay perfect. But just what are the strangest requests they have ever received?

Hotel concierges are usually only too keen to fulfil their guests' requests, but some travellers push it too far

A personal invite for a llama - Grand Del Mar, San Diego

A guest staying at the Grand Del Mar in San Diego, California, wanted to surprise a friend with news of a trip away.

So to give a clue, he negotiated with hotel staff to bring a llama in to help give a clue as to where he was whisking his mate off to.

It was of course Peru, and they happily went off some time later. The llama was of course taken home safely.

One man keen to reveal a surprise destination in a clever way to a friend asked for, and got, a llama 

Penguins waiting in the room - Four Seasons, Hawaii

Sitting alongside the llama for one of the wackiest requests comes courtesy of the fantasy island of Hawaii.

A concierge at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai has revealed that one guest asked for a group of penguins to be waiting for them in their room, with Morgan Freeman narrating the meeting.

Sadly, the guest didn't get chance to p-p-p-pick up a penguin, and the request was dismissed.

No shock that a request for penguins to be waiting in the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai was dismissed

Room full of Nicholas Cages - Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk, Texas

Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz decided to have some fun when she checked into the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk during a business trip.

After receiving a welcome text that offered assistance 'any time,' Ms Grzywacz replied back saying she would like a signed picture of Nicholas Cage in Con Air on her bed.

And the well-meaning staff adhered to her request, and the actors face was waiting on entry.

The rest of the trip involved various other requests for Nicholas Cage in an array of films, all granted by the hotel.

Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz was delighted when her jokey requests for images of Nicholas Cage were fulfilled 

The dedicated staff delivered the requested images, and even apologised when one didn't come in time 

Three M&Ms and a bacon portrait - Woodlands Resort, Houston 

Bacon is a beautiful thing to many people, so much so a guest asked for a picture of it in his room along with three red M&Ms

Dustin Wray and girlfriend Lauren Taylor decided to spent the night at the Woodlands Resort in Houston after purchasing tickets to see their favorite singer John Mayer perform there.

When Dustin had completed the online booking for the hotel room a month earlier he couldn’t resist having some fun when it came to the ‘special requests’ section.

Dustin requested: ‘Three red M&Ms on the counter. Not packages, just three single M&Ms. One for me, one for my girlfriend, and one to split if we get hungry late at night. And a picture of bacon set on the bed. I love pictures of bacon.’

And sure enough, on checking into their room they were met by the M&Ms, which they shared, and the delicious photo of bacon.

Lovely stuff.

A large rubber duck in the bathroom? - Premier Inn, Godstone

It's always nice to have some element of home comforts when your staying in a hotel.

And one guest made sure he wasn't going to miss out during his stay at the Premier Inn in Goldstone, Surrey, when he requested a large rubber duck for the bathroom.

Other requests received by staff for the brand with the Lenny Henry commercials include a team member loaning a guest their trousers for an important last minute meeting in Liverpool, helping a guest buy a new bridesmaid's dress as the original had ripped on a wedding day in Ross on Wye and helping a guest propose to their bride to be because they were too nervous in Bournemouth.

Can I bring my 6ft-long lizard? - Travelodge, Lowestoft

Can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight? Can you call Windsor Castle and find out if the Queen is in? Can you store my lobster in your freezer?

These are just some of the peculiar requests Travelodge staff have been asked by customers. 

One such customer who was staying at Docklands Travelodge asked the hotel team if he could practice his board presentation in Mandarin to the hotel team prior to a meeting.

A 6ft-long monitor lizard wasn't included in the Lowestoft Travelodge's list of permitted pets

Another, staying at Edinburgh Central Travelodge, asked the hotel manager if he could borrow his suit for the morning as he had a job interview and he forgot his suit at home.

Meanwhile, the hotel receptionist at Luton Travelodge received a call from a PA to see if her boss could be dropped off by helicopter in the hotel car-park.

And the best of all was a man who was unsure if the pet policy covered his far-from-domestic animal at the Lowestoft Travelodge - a 6ft monitor lizard.

Help to buy two camels? - Loews Ventana Canyon Resort, Arizona

A guests asked the staff at the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort in Tucson, Arizona if they could assist him buy two camels.

The concierge, who was on her first month in the job, kept her cool, and a straight face, located a nearby dealer, and the guest's wish was fulfilled.

Well nearly... after giving the camels a 'once over,' the camel had one too few humps for the guest's liking and he pulled out of the deal. He clearly should have specified he wanted a bactrian breed of camel so he didn't get a dromedary. 

Although a concierge found a camel dealer in Arizona, the guest wanted them to have two humps not one

Wild goat's milk from Wales... for a bath - Savoy Hotel, London

The Savoy's head butler Sean Davoren has had some wacky requests in his days service elite guests, with wild goat's milk for a guest's bath among the more unusual.

But it was certainly achievable, at a cost. The milk itself cost a manageable £50, but the taxi fare to Wales and back to get it ran up £600 on the meter. 

The milk was then warmed up, and 30 bottles of heated Evian was used to rinse the white stuff off the picky client afterwards.

A unicorn greeting - Hotel Indigo in Asheville, North Carolina

For all of a hotel employee's good intentions, mythical animals are a request too far.

But the concierge at the Hotel Indigo in Asheville, North Carolina, thought outside the box, and purchased a cuddly unicorn toy instead.

Citing that the unicorn had 'migrated' for the season, the toy was left with an apology of not being able to purchase the real thing.
