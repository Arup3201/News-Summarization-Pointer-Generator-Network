A 33-year-old woman has died after fighting a flesh-eating bacteria which ravaged her body for a month.

Crystal Spencer died at Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital on Sunday night in Detroit, Michigan after she had been admitted to the emergency department of another Detroit hospital with severe pain from a large boil on her thigh on June 30.

Mrs Spencer’s husband Jeff believes she contracted the flesh-eating bacteria necrotizing fasciitis at the emergency department at Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

Death by bacteria: Crystal Spencer has died after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria a month ago

He plans to have an autopsy done to find out how exactly his wife died, his attorney Brian Benner said.

Two days after the Farmington Hills woman was admitted to Botsford Hospital, Mrs Spencer was transferred to Huron Valley-Sinai where she underwent a four hour procedure to remove what Mr Spencer called a ‘watermelon-size’ piece of flesh from her thigh.

Her condition improved enough to be sent home but she was readmitted again when her condition deteriorated.

Legal action: Mr Spencer plans to sue Botsford Hospital where he believes Mrs Spencer contracted necrotizing fasciitis

Mr Spencer said that he will be taking legal action against Botsford Hospital where he believes she contracted the rare infection.

Dr Gerald Blackburn, the hospital’s infectious diseases director and other staff had reviewed Mrs Spencer’s case, the hospital spokeswoman Margo Gorchow said according to Detroit Free Press.

Ms Gorchow said that the hospital would aid with any investigation into the case but said there were many reasons why Mrs Spencer could not have contracted the disease at Botsford Hospital.

Ms Gorchow said that the bacteria is usually not contracted in a hospital but caused by an open wound. 

Mrs Spencer did not present any symptoms of the condition when she was treated at the hospital and she neglected to follow the doctor’s discharge instructions to see the doctor the next day.

She was also the ‘classic example of a person at risk’ of infection because Mrs Spencer was diabetic, overweight and a smoker making her ‘more vulnerable’.

Not at the hospital: Botsford Hospital officials say that Mrs Spencer would not have contracted the bacteria at the hospital and that she had not followed discharge instructions

According to KSDK, Mrs Spencer’s family were preparing for her to enter rehab until her condition deteriorated suddenly.

Eric Spencer, her father-in-law said: ‘I mean she was cheerful and whatever. She was looking forward and on her way to recovery.’

Her husband had said while she fought the bacteria that she only had a 20 to 30 per cent chance of surviving the aggressive disease, and say her Type 2 diabetes has complicated her recovery.

Other recent cases of the flesh-eating disease have been reported in South Carolina and Georgia, making this one of the first in the north of America.

Victim: Georgia grad student Aimee Copeland, 24, also contracted the aggressive disease after cutting her leg falling from a zipline. She had a leg, the other foot and both hands amputated to save her life

Road to recovery: Aimee was pictured smiling with her parents outside the hospital last week

Student Aimee Copeland had her leg, the other foot and both hands amputated, as well as part of her torso, to save her life.

Recent pictures show her grinning in the hospital, and her parents have said she is determined to walk at her graduation ceremony in December.

Necrotizing
fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but
extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to 
something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy 
skin, muscles and fat.

The
disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a 
minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that 
kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms
include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading 
bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock 
are also common complications.

Sufferers
must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given 
powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can 
become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
