Collared: James Cosby, 46, has been arrested on charges of tampering with evidence in the killings of his daughter and her girlfriend, both 24, last week

The father of one of two women whose bodies were found behind a Dumpster in Texas has been charged with evidence tampering in both killings, which may have been motivated by the victims’ sexual orientation.

James Larry Cosby, 46, from Houston, remains jailed on $500,000 bond, said Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset.

Trochesset said the investigation is ongoing and charges against Cosby could be upgraded to capital murder.

‘It appears that the young ladies may have been murdered in his home,’ he said.

The bodies of Britney Cosby and Crystal Jackson, both 24, who investigators say were in a romantic relationship, were discovered March 7 next to a trash bin behind a store in Galveston.

Officials say Miss Cosby died from blows to the head and Jackson from a gunshot wound.

Loranda McDonald, Cosby's mother, suggested that her father may have murdered the young woman because she was a lesbian.  

‘He said it to me a few times that he did not like the idea of her being gay,’ said McDonald.

The grieving mother also revealed that she wants Cosby to ‘suffer’ and feel the pain that she is feeling.

‘Right now I hate him, I'm very angry with him,’ she told ABC 13.

Investigators believe the women, from Houston, were killed elsewhere and their bodies were dumped on the Bolivar Peninsula.

Search: Detectives are now looking for the couple's new silver Kia, pictured, which was stolen

A few hours before his arrest, James Cosby had attended a vigil Wednesday evening in Houston for the women.

Trochesset
 said that after the vigil, sheriff's office investigators went to 
Cosby's home and interviewed him. During the interview, investigators 
became suspicious of Cosby and things they saw at the home.

After obtaining a search warrant, officials found ‘blood and other evidence’ at the home, Trochesset said.

Detectives
 are still searching for the slain couple’s silver 2006 Kia Sorrento, 
which they suspect may have been used by the killer to transport the 
women’s bodies to the dump site. 

According to a police report, officers inspecting Cosby's home seized a hammer and noticed a missing window shutter.

A similar shutter was found covered in blood and bearing James Cosby's fingerprints next to the women's bodies.

Community activist Quanell X described the grisly scene inside James Cosby’s blood-spattered home.

‘Blood was all on the walls, all on the speakers -- on the sofa,’ he told ABC 13.

Mr X, the family’s spokesman, also claimed that he found writings condemning homosexuality as a sin on Cosby's Koran, MyFox Houston reported.

Crystal
 Jackson's father, Reverend Ivan Jackson, told the news channel that he too did not
 agree with his daughter’s sexual orientation, but loved her as much as 
his other children.

Mr Cosby has been charged with two counts of evidence-tampering. He is being held at the Galveston County Jail on $500,000 bond.

Cosby, who has a long criminal history, had been released from prison about five months ago, Trochesset said.

Harris
 County court records show he had received a two-year prison term in 
2011 for failing to register as a sex offender in connection with a 1994
 aggravated assault conviction.

The records also show a prior conviction for failure to register as a sex 
offender and convictions for assault and unlawfully carrying a weapon.

Britney
 Cosby and Crystal Jackson left their home in Houston, Texas on 
Wednesday night for a trip to Galveston - which is 50 miles south - in 
their new Kia Sorrento.

But 
their families did not hear from them and at 7.30am last Friday, a beer 
delivery man found their bodies near a Dumpster outside a convenience 
store in Port Bolivar, just north of Galveston.

Second crime scene: Police searching James Cosby's Houston home discovered blood and other evidence, suggesting that the women may have been killed there

The Galveston County Medical Examiner's Office concluded that Cosby died from the result of blunt force trauma while Jackson was killed by a gunshot wound, KTRK reported.

The couple had been together for two years and lived together.

Jackson, a barista at Starbucks, was the mother of a five-year-old. Cosby worked as a security guard.

'That was her girlfriend, that was her soulmate,' one of Cosby's neighbor's, James Randle, told ABC.

On Valentine's Day, Jackson wrote a Facebook message to Cosby beneath a photo of them together.

'Words can't explain 
how u make me feel,' she wrote.

'From the moment we met, I just knew u was the one 
for me, through all the tears, laughter, the good and bad, I still love u
 always and forever.'

On Sunday, police released a composite sketch of the suspect who was reportedly seen driving the car, which in retrospect bears a strong resemblance to Cosby's father.
