Scotland vs England. It wasn’t bad was it? Passion, atmosphere, goals, we really should do this again soon. Same time next year?

England’s 3-1 victory against their counterparts north of the border was, as far as international friendlies go, an epic encounter.

Look what it meant to the players; when was the last time Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal as he did on Tuesday night?

And we shouldn’t forget the fans. The atmosphere inside Celtic Park was pulsating. The response on social media was emphatic, too. Not to mention the eight million or so who tuned in to ITV’s coverage. 

So, why was last night’s game only the second meeting between the two old enemies in 15 years?

We should be making this an annual get-together. Why play a meaningless friendly against Norway in front of a half-empty, half-interested Wembley crowd, when we could have a repeat of what happened at Celtic Park. 

Get a trophy in place – it would give England and Scotland a real chance of actually winning something – and name it after the two nation’s finest players. How about the Moore-Dalglish Shield or the Charlton-Law Vase?

Let’s alternate venues, too. Wembley next year, and then back up north for the following campaign. A football version of the Calcutta Cup. Surely it’s a no-brainer?

Those from footballing yesteryear will remember the two nations clashing every year. The Home International Championships saw England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland battle it out annually.

But with crowd trouble on the rise, a piled fixture list, lack of interest in the matches – notably bar England vs Scotland – and the Three Lions citing a desire to play against ‘stronger’ teams, the tournament was canned in 1984 after 100 long years.

Although attempts were made to revive the competition in 2011, albeit without England, the re-branded tournament flopped and was discontinued over poor attendances.

But that shouldn’t put England and Scotland off staging an annual fixture. This is the fixture which really matters, and the evidence was on show last night. The fans behaved themselves, too. 

The FA and SFA should get their heads together and make it happen annually. Every November, under the lights, two teams battling it out to be the best in Britain. What’s not to love?

With the Premier League and Champions League taking centre stage, this could be the best way to revive all of our flagging interests in the international game.
