The uncle of 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius said his nephew is not a liar and has 'no intention to travel overseas', only hours after the sprinter was granted permission to travel abroad.

A South African judge relaxed bail conditions yesterday imposed after the Paralympic and Olympic track star was charged with murdering his girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

Arnold Pistorius said the ordeal had brought the Pistorius family closer together, adding that they wished to connect with the family of Reeva Steenkamp in the future.

Verdict: Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius successfully appealed against some of his bail restrictions on Thursday

'We can just imagine Reeva's mother 
and father and their family, what they must be going through, it is 
unthinkable. So, we hope to meet them one day and try to share this 
hardship with them, that we also experience.'

Stressing his family's support and a belief in his nephew's innocence, Arnold Pistorius said Oscar was not a 'liar'.

'We
know the facts and we know exactly what was going on, because Oscar is 
not a liar. The one thing, he has made a lot of mistakes, but the one 
thing he has never done is lie.

'So we trust him - what he said to us - as the facts. And it was a terrible, terrible mistake.'

Speaking about the family of model Reeva Steenkamp, Arnold Pistorius said he could not imagine their grief.

'One
can never feel that pain that a mother and a father must feel for the 
child that they have lost, that must be terrible. And for Oscar to have 
lost... what is worse than losing somebody you love and you have been 
the... the instrument? It is unthinkable.'

Asked if Pistorius would be returning to the competitive track in the near future, his uncle revealed:'Not in the near future, not realistically. No, I don't think so. In the future - perhaps, yes, I would like to say that.'

Set for a return? Pistorius wins gold in the men's 400m - T44 final at the 
London Paralympics. His lawyers argued that he might need to run at track meets
again to earn money

Conditions: Pistorius must provide authorities with his travel plans at 
least a week before he leaves the country. He must also return his passport to the court within 24 hours of returning to South Africa

Arnold
Pistorius added that family members were encouraging the athlete to 
return to training, fearing it would affect his long term performance.

'The
knowledgeable people tell me that if a super athlete does not train for
a year then he will never get back to where he was. So we try to 
convince him to get back into training.'

The runner is free to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms yesterday to allow him to make money

Lawyers for the ‘Blade Runner’ 
successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad and ‘earn
income’ while awaiting trial.  

Defence: Pistorius says he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house

The controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in London’s showpiece athletics event at the Olympic Stadium.

Pistorius, 26, is charged with the 
murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot after she locked 
herself in his bathroom in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He claims
he mistook her for an intruder.

The Olympic and Paralympic athlete 
was not present as judge Bert Bam told North Gauteng High Court in South
Africa that bail restrictions should be eased to allow Pistorius to 
travel abroad to compete at international athletics meetings, provided 
he handed over a detailed itinerary at least a week before his 
departure.

Miss Steenkamp’s family did not comment on the decision, which came despite strong objections from prosecutors.

Victim: Reeva Steenkamp, a successful South African fashion model and television personality,  was found dead at the home she shared with the paralympic athlete

It is certain to prove controversial 
as  it potentially paves the way for Pistorius, one of the world’s most 
successful athletes, to earn vast sums of money while he  is awaiting 
trial.

Although charged with murder, 
Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime  and would be allowed to 
enter Britain by the Home Office.

It is now likely that he will compete
at the London Anniversary Games, which takes place from July 26 to 28 
at the Olympic Stadium in East London – one year on from London 2012 and
the final event at the venue before work begins to convert into the 
home of West Ham football club.

It is also the last major athletics event before the World Championships in Moscow two weeks later. 
Significantly, Pistorius’ agent Peet van
Zyl said yesterday that the competitions could be ‘on the radar’ for 
the athlete, who  last year became the first to  take part in both an 
Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The International Association of 
Athletics Federations said the double amputee would be allowed to 
compete in this summer’s competitions if he qualifies.

Yannis Nikolau, spokesman for the 
ruling body, added that Pistorus would be ‘free to run . . . on the 
basis of the “innocent until proven guilty” principle’.

There
is also the possibility that Pistorius, who can receive tens of 
thousands of pounds in appearance money, could compete in the British 
Athletics Birmingham Grand Prix at the end of June.

At
yesterday’s bail appeal hearing, Pistorius’ lawyer Barry Roux said that
while his client had no immediate plans to compete, it is likely he 
would need to return to the track to earn money.

Since
his arrest the Paralympic gold medallist has sold assets including a 
share in a racehorse and property. ‘He is not going to run away and 
hide. He is going nowhere,’ Mr Roux told the judge.

‘It’s only, only, only to earn 
income . . . No other reason and under controlled circumstances. Why 
stop him from travelling under controlled circumstances?’

Mr Roux also argued that Pistorius 
should be able to return to his home and the scene of the shooting, 
which has been investigated by the prosecution.

‘The accused can’t be stopped [from 
going] back to his house indefinitely,’ he insisted. Pistorius claims he
killed 29-year-old model Miss Steenkamp accidentally when he fired 
shots through his bathroom door in the early hours, fearing she was an 
intruder.

Prosecutors say he shot her intentionally after they argued.

His bail terms originally required 
him to hand over his passport, avoid his home in Pretoria and all 
witnesses in the case, report to a police station twice a week and 
abstain from drinking alcohol.

But these rules were relaxed by Judge Bam, who described the decision not to grant Pistorius permission to travel as ‘wrong’.

He also no longer has to be regularly supervised by a probation official and the ban against him drinking alcohol was lifted.
