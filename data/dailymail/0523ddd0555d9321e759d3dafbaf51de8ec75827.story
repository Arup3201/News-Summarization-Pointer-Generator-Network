The family of former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke has spoken out about his clandestine relationship with now-wife Blanche D'Alpuget, saying that in its early stages it almost destroyed their family.

Breaking their long-held silence, the children and grandchildren of Mr Hawke spoke to Australian Story about the rift that divided them when the former Prime Minister announced that he was leaving his wife of 39 years, Hazel Hawke, to be with Ms D'Alpuget.

Mr Hawke's grandson David Dillon said that his grandparent's divorce really rocked the family, especially when it was announced he planned to marry Ms D'Alpuget.

Mr Hawke, who turns 85 this year, sparked public and private backlash when it was revealed that he had been having an affair for nearly 20 years with Ms D'Alpuget, who was also his biographer, reported The ABC.

While Mr Hawke famously swore off alcohol for his time in office in recognition of his need to be accountable to the Australian public and reliable as their leader, he continued his affair with Ms D'Alpuget in a continuous act of infidelity which shocked the nation. 

'I think initially when our grandparents split and Bob moved on with Blanche it really tore our family apart,' said Mr Dillon in the second of a two-part special with the program, which goes behind the scenes in The Lodge.

Mr Hawke's children have reportedly been estranged since his marriage to Ms D'Alpuget in 1995, speaking to Australian Story about the open hostility she experienced from them

The relationship between the Hawke generations have eased recently, especially since the death of Mr Hawke's ex-wife in 2012 after a long battle with Alzheimer's

Mr Hawke's children  reportedly became estranged after his marriage to Ms D'Alpuget in 1995, speaking to Australian Story about the open hostility she experienced from them.

However, the relationship between the Hawke generations has eased recently, especially since the death of Mr Hawke's ex-wife in 2012 after a long battle with Alzheimer's.

Mr Hawke's daughter Sue Pieter-Hawke said that her father had shown genuine sorrow for some of the pain he caused his ex-wife.

'Dad gave a very touching speech at the private reception we had after the very public memorial for Mum nearly two years ago at the Opera House,' said Ms Pieter-Hawke.

'And he was quite emotional and genuinely distressed and conceded some of the distress he caused her and I think it was very moving that he did that,' she said.

'I think he’s a man who has made amends where amends need to be made.' 

Mr Dillon said that Ms D'Alpuget played a large role in creating paths for relationships within the family to be mended.  

'Blanche expressed a lot of love in times of adversity,' said Mr Dillon.

'She is a really strong woman and she’s played a really important role in allowing our family to reconnect and get over that initial big hurdle that we experienced through the divorce,' he said.

Mr Dillon said that the family had worked hard to get to a place of healing and friendship with his grandfather's wife. 

'Time heals all wounds and we have moved into a place now where we have an amazing relationship with both Bob and Blanche,' he said.

The full documentary special of Australian Story will air on Monday night at 8pm on the ABC.
