A suburban Detroit police officer has been fired and a handful of others are under investigation after surveillance footage showed a cop cut off a young mother’s weave.

Charda Gregory’s weave was crudely chopped off late last year by former Warren Police Officer Bernadette Najor using a pair of scissors after she was arrested for trashing a seedy motel on the notorious 8 Mile Road.

The weave was removed, Ms Najor told her superiors, because Ms Gregory was deemed a suicide risk – reasoning that police commissioner Jere Green told WXYZ ‘makes no sense.’

Scissors: The clippers used by the disgraced cop can be clearly seen in the video

‘There’s a real simple thing: it’s called right and wrong.  And to me this is something that I won’t tolerate,’ Mr Green told the station. ; “I don’t buy that’s the proper way to treat a human being.

‘I don’t think it’s decent, I don’t think there was any reason to do it, and when I look at it – that bothers me,’ he continued.

The disturbing footage captured in November first shows Ms Gregory unable to stand straight up, she told the station she was drugged during a party that evening.

Ms Najors is shown pushing Ms Gregory multiple times before she and three fellow officers drag the woman to a holding chair and strap down her limbs.

The disgraced officer then pulls out a pair of scissors and begins chopping off large chunks of the restrained woman’s hair, the pain is so intense her legs flail in agony.

‘She took it upon herself to get the scissors.  And for whatever reason, decided that she was going to butcher my client,’ lawyer Paul Misukewicz said.

The demeaning ordeal is not finished until Ms Najors finishes by forcibly yanking a big chunk of hair from Ms Gregory’s head – which she says left her bald in spots as a result of the hair being pulled out by the roots.

‘She’s a very horrible person,’ Ms Gregory said.

‘I guess the best way to describe it would be sadistic,’ her attorney added.’ There’s absolutely no reason for it.  And it’s demeaning’

The officer was initially placed on leave by Mr Green but then fired, he said. It was not her first disciplinary action.

Documents uncovered by WXYZ showed she had been suspended in the past for being ‘untruthful.’

When confronted in a local shopping center by a WXYZ reporter, the former officer shouted that she would ‘call the police’ if the camera wasn’t taken off of her.

The charges originally brought against Ms Gregory have since been dropped, and the other officers involved are being investigated as to why they did not intervene despite reporting the incident to superiors.
