The billionaire family of a Red Bull energy drink heir accused of killing a police officer in a hit-and-run accident have paid the officer's siblings about $100,000 in a deal that may avoid a civil lawsuit.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, 27, is charged with driving a Ferrari that struck the officer and dragged his body down a Bangkok street earlier this month.

The Yoovidhya family paid the officer's siblings 3 million baht ($97,000) last week, police Lt. Col. Viradon Thubthimdee said. He said the settlement will protect Vorayuth from a civil lawsuit.

This $1m Ferrari is believed to be the car that struck the officer and dragged his body down a Bangkok street

'We sometimes call this a "funeral 
fee". If the victim's party is satisfied with the amount of money, then 
they will not seek compensation through a court,' Viradon said.

The payment, however, does not 
protect Vorayuth from criminal charges of causing death by reckless 
driving and fleeing to avoid arrest.

If convicted, Yoovidhya, the grandson of the late Red Bull creator Chaleo Yoovidhya, faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of 20,000 baht ($666).

The payment from the extremely wealthy
family is also unlikely to quell public outrage over the incident and 
an initial attempt to cover up Vorayuth's alleged involvement by 
arresting a bogus suspect.

The family was ranked fourth richest in the country this year by Forbes magazine with a net worth of $5.4 billion.

Yoovidhya's grandfather Chaleo (left), the founder of the energy drink Red Bull, died in his 80s in March, leaving his heirs a wide range of businesses

They own a wide range of businesses, 
including shares in the energy drink brand, hospitals, real estate and 
the sole authorized importer of Ferrari cars in Thailand.

The car involved in the accident was valued at about 30 million baht ($1 million).

'3 million baht is too little ... how 
could a sports car be more expensive than a man's life?' a commentator 
said on a popular Thai Web forum, pantip.com.

'His wrecked Ferrari should have been sold and the money should be added to the compensation money,' another forum user wrote.

It is not uncommon for the rich and privileged to get away with crimes in Thailand. Though there is no suggestion Yoovidhya is trying to escape justice or that the authorities are not taking the matter seriously.

Investigators are waiting for 
forensic test results before possibly adding more charges against 
Vorayuth, including speeding, drunken driving and drug use.

No date has been set for a trial.
