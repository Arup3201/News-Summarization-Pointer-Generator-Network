Jamie Carragher has criticised Liverpool's Emre Can for his sloppy display in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup draw against Chelsea.

The German midfielder has been used as a makeshift defender in recent weeks, but bundled Eden Hazard to the ground in the box before the break as the Belgian fired the visitors ahead from the spot.

Raheem Sterling's second-half strike spared Can's blushes as the Reds came from behind to leave the semi-final on a knife-edge ahead of next week's second-leg at Stamford Bridge.

But former Liverpool defender Carragher stuck the boot in to the 21-year-old.

'He played really well in the last five or six games bringing the ball out,' Carragher told Sky Sports.

'But against top-class players he's been found wanting. He got beaten too easily and tried to rectify it and made two mistakes.

'He found it really difficult and looked like a midfielder playing at the back. People say he's been doing well recently in relation to bringing the ball out, but it was clumsy and a penalty, no doubt about it.'

Carragher received a backlash on social media but took to Kicca to explain his comments.

He wrote: 'When I've seen him (and I watch every game) defend he's struggled at times in the game against Leicester, Wimbledon & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but Lfc had over 60% possession so didn't have much defending to do.

'My point is tonight was the first time he's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously Lfc would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he's impressed.'

Great game tonight at Anfield proper cup tie, but my comments regarding Emre Can at ht & afterwards seemed to get most reaction on social media from Lfc fans! 

My thoughts on Can at CB in a back 3 is that he gives control to the team on the ball and helps the team build from the back. 

In a back 3 he will also have less defending to do but, when I've seen him (and I watch every game) defend he's struggled at times in the game against Leicester, Wimbledon & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but Lfc had over 60% possession so didn't have much defending to do and he was good as you'd expect with the ball & with Hazard defensivley a couple of times second half. 

My point is tonight was the first time he's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously Lfc would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he's impressed. 

But if the opposition dominate he'll have to do more defending, and CB's in a back 3 think if you had to put them in a 2 in a back 4 would you want Can there probably not but why? 

Because his main strength is not the defending its bringing the ball out which he'd do less in a back 4!! hopefully that clears my thoughts up And yes I wasn't quick & also made mistakes!!
