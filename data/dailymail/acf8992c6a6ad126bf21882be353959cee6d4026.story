Kamara confessed to the crimes and pleaded guilty on Monday.

The ex-nanny was never authorized to write checks from the account.

However, between May 2011 and May 2013, she forged the couple's signature on the checks and then cashed them, prosecutors said, earning a total of $431,542.

The victims discovered the theft and fired Kamara in May 2013.

According to the criminal complaint, she wrote her former employers a handwritten letter soon after apologizing for her actions.

'I ask your forgiveness. You can take me to court, send me in jail and throw the keys into the sea, your actions will be justified,' the letter reads.

'I stole your money to build my house in Africa.'

In addition to her new home, Kamara send money transfers and also used it to gamble at a casino in Charles Town, West Virginia, authorities said.

However, she disputes the amount of money that she took from the couple.

Kamara faces up to 20 years in prison for mail fraud and a mandatory minimum of two years, according to NBC News. She has also agreed to pay back the $431,542.

She will be sentenced October 14.
