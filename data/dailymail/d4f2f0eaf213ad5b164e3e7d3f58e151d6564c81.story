Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly exchanged final petty insults and jibes but stopped short of turning their weigh-in violent.

Both men had been warned about their conduct as fears grew that a fight would breakout prematurely.

But they kept their cool to ensure their bitter rematch goes ahead on Saturday night.

Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon before their fight on Saturday evening

The pair managed to keep the weigh-in civil without any violence but made sure they got in their last psychological digs at one another 

Both weighed in under the cruiserweight limit in front of a capacity crowd in the resplendent St George's Hall.

Unsurprisingly, their cheers were reserved entirely for Bellew with Cleverly on the end of a rather more hostile reception.

Perhaps mercifully, three long years of talking is now at an end as Bellew bids to avenge his defeat to then world champion Cleverly.

The Liverpool crowd was orchestrated by Bellew who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown for the weigh-in

Cleverly received a hostile reception in Liverpool but remained focused at the weigh-in on Friday, weighing in just below the limit

They will next set eyes on each other ahead of the first bell at a sold-out Liverpool Echo Arena. 

'It’s been a long time coming but tomorrow the talking stops. It’s real now and I’m excited,' Bellew told Sky Sports News HQ.

‘I talk a great fight because that’s what I feel. I’m the cruiserweight here, a manufactured cruiserweight against a fat cruiserweight.’

Bellew added: ‘I’ve waited long and hard in a 12 week training camp away from family and loved ones whereas he stayed in a dingy house in Wales. He (Cleverly) should have stayed and trained in London with Adam Booth.

‘You need more vision and desire than that. I have more desire than anyone in this division.

This could be the fight of the year if he can absorb what I’ve got for him.

Both fighters insist the talking stops now but they had plenty to say to each other during the weigh-in and had to be separated

‘I’ve prepared to go to the trenches, I’m prepared to go to war. If not then it’s going to be a very short, sharp fight for him.

‘This is the defining fight in both of our careers. We will be remembered for Saturday night, simple as that. It will be a painful, brutal fight for him. It will be the end of his career Saturday night.’ 

Meanwhile, Cleverly had his say at the weigh-in: 'I’m very happy, it’s a good weight for me. Making the weight isn’t a problem and I feel good.

'I’m ready, I’ve had a great training camp, mentally I feel sharp and I should perform well. It’s the biggest fight of my life. It’s such a grudge match, a massive rivalry and it’s got personal. When I win it will mean the world to me and then I can move on to bigger and better challenges.

'It’s going to be a tremendous atmosphere. I really hope and I really think it’s going to be a great fight. Cruiserweight is chapter two for me and this is the acid test.'
