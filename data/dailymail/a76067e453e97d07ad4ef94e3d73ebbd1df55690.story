Pennsylvania 11-year-old Sarah Murnaghan got a second chance at life last year when she received a new set of lungs from an adult organ donor, becoming the exception to a nationwide rule.

Before Murnaghan, children under 12 were only allowed to receive donations from other children but on Monday the Organ Procurement and Transplantation network voted and changed the policy.

Now all sick children may apply to receive adult organs, giving them a better shot at recovery.

Murnaghan and her parents offered comments after a national transplant board voted to permanently allow children the opportunity to apply for adult organ donations

The little girl spoke about the crucial piece of legislation at a press conference outside of her family's Newtown Square home on Monday.

She called the rule change 'great' before wading into the more kid-friendly topic of summer.

'We do school work with mom and dad and we go to the pool and we go to some parks,' she said.

Murnaghan's case sparked national debate last year when doctors gave the cystic fibrosis patientÂ  just weeks to live.

At the time, the 11-year-old was only eligible to receive an organ from another child and child organ donations are rare.

In a last ditch effort, her desperate parents launched a public campaign to get her on the adult list and a federal judge agreed - handing down a court order to halt the Under 12 rule.

The ruling was a success since Sarah has just breathing on her own for the first time in three years.

Murnaghan returned to the hospital on the first anniversary of the controversial transplant to have a tube in her neck, which had been used to connect a ventilator, taken out.

In a statement, her family called the lawsuit 'the absolute last resort' after other appeals failed.

'We believed making lungs from donors 12 and older available to children under 12 who are good candidates to receive them was the right thing to do. We very much appreciate that the medical community (now) agrees with that,' the family, including parents Janet and Francis Murnaghan, said.

The lung transplant issue only affects about 20 children a year, making it difficult to study outcomes, the network said. A dozen children have asked to be added to the adult list under a waiver this past year, but most are still matched with donor lungs from children, the transplant network said.

Sarah with her mother and father who launched a campaign get her access to the adult donor waiting list. Eventually they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult lungs

Plight: Sarah had been a top candidate for organs from a child donor but such donations are rare

'Any allocation policy must weigh the unique needs and circumstances of transplant candidates with the benefit a transplant can provide them,' said Dr. Stuart Sweet, secretary of the network, a private nonprofit group that manages U.S. organ allocation.

'This is a difficult balance for very young lung transplant candidates in particular,' Sweet said. 'The progression of their lung disease may be considerably different from other patients, even those just a few years older.'

Lung transplants are not a cure for cystic fibrosis but can buy time. The typical life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients is 37 years and continues to rise as new medical advances are developed.

The case raised questions among some health specialists and medical ethicists about how organ donation rules are developed and under what circumstances they might be disregarded.
