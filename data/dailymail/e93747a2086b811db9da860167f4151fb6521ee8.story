Olympic ace Victoria Pendleton delighted the Tory conference today by urging youngsters to take up sport to help them get a job later on in life.

The cyclist said playing sport helped build vital characteristics which bosses wanted.

She said: 'It builds character, confidence and resilience - things that don't necessarily show up in test results but that employers are always looking for.'

The remarks echo Lord Tebbit's famous suggestion that the unemployed should get on their bike to find work.

Ms Pendleton, who won gold in the velodrome at the Beijing and London Olympic Games, was at the Tory conference today to introduce Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

The cycling star told activists that every child should have access to PE at school.

She said: 'It can bridge the gap between socio-economic status, race, gender, ethnicity and disability.

'Whatever you want to do, wherever you are, whoever you are, you can always get involved and that's all you need to do to reap the extensive benefits - the physical, mental, social, intellectual benefits.'

She went on: 'In most instances, you just need someone with a little enthusiasm to give you a bit of direction and a little bit of encouragement.

'You don't have to be gifted and you don't have to want to do it professionally - you just have to enjoy taking part as the lessons you learn in childhood are vital and will stay with you for the rest of your life.

'Sport teaches kids things you can't measure - determination, discipline, persistence, team work, integrity, honesty.'

'It builds character, confidence and resilience - things that don't necessarily show up in test results but that employers are always looking for.'

She said research showed more than 90 per cent of children behaved better and more than 95 per cent were fitter and healthier after more sport was added to the curriculum.

The cycling star said sport adds 'firm foundations' for a healthy future.

Pendleton's appearance on the Tory party platform was a long way from collecting gold on the podium at the London 2012 Olympic Games

Ms Pendleton said: 'Sport can often provide opportunity for children who feel their circumstances limit their options in life, increasing their confidence and the aspirations.

'Of course not every child can score in the premiership or clinch Olympic Gold but you can't underestimate the life lessons sport can offer - sometimes you win, sometimes you lose in sport as in life.

'But it's how deal with the success and the failure that builds character and that's what sport and physical activity can provide in abundance.'

Norman Tebbit, who was Employment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, said his father 'got on his bike' to find work

Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'.

But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' never actually said anything of the sort. The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981.

A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'.

The then Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.'
