Being Kate Middleton's hair must be quite fun. One flick, and the press goes crazy. Not since Betty Grable became known as the Girl With The Million Dollar Legs has a single aspect of a woman's appearance gripped the world’s attention so completely.

The Duchess of Cambridge's hair has become such an obsession it practically needs its own agent to manage the endless stream of speculation about who's cutting it, whether it's been coloured, tonged or blow-dried, and exactly how she manages to keep it so annoyingly swishy.

After its slightly tired-looking Poppy Day appearance (never have one woman's grey roots made the front pages of so many newspapers), it came out fighting at a recent charity event, that familiar chestnutty gloss restored, those curls soft and just the right side of tousled.

Copy Kate: But where can you get hair just like hers?

Question was: who had done it? Step forward . . . half of London's top salons.

In hairdressing circles, 'owning' the K. Middy locks is PR gold. Not only does an association with Kate's hair carry huge cachet, it also guarantees a full appointment book.

The result has been some less than edifying behaviour, the kind of backbiting, infighting and general Machiavellian plotting more usually found in the corridors of the House of Commons. Only better dressed, obviously.

Many can lay legitimate claim to have handled the hallowed follicles. During her engagement and in the run-up to her wedding, she (along with her mother and sister) patronised the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea.

Enviable: The Duchess of Cambridge's glossy locks are coveted around the world

James Pryce was her main stylist, and it was he who teased her hair into the soft, romantic half-chignon on the big day.

Both Ward and Pryce's stock rocketed; but then, as so often happens when a stylist makes the transition from mere salon employee to a name in their own right, the pair fell out.

They went their separate ways - and the divorce has been far from amicable. There have been all kinds of vicious rumours swirling around the internet about Pryce trading on his royal associations, all of which he strenuously denies. Luckily, he has found a new berth at the Josh Wood Atelier, alongside other similarly battle-scarred refugees.

George Northwood, formerly a protege of Daniel Hersheson, is there, quietly tending to the likes of Alexa Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley; and Josh himself is a survivor of a fallout, with his old partner at another top Chelsea salon, Real Hair.

In fact, the Atelier has become a kind of rebellious refuge for star stylists who've come a-cropper of their former bosses, a place to find top hairdressing talent that’s more interested in hair than in the politics of hair.

All the stylists work for themselves, and no one owns anyone - it's a sort of anti-salon, where clients’ privacy is respected and discretion is key.

Meanwhile, the battle of the royal barnet rages on, and this time the invader is an Italian called Rossano Ferretti, who claims to have pioneered his own cutting technique - which he calls 'the method' - and who charges £600 a pop for the pleasure of it.

It was he, the Ferretti camp claim, who restored Kate's hair to its former glory. But the gossip is that she didn't have her hair cut by Ferretti at all, merely dropped in at a party at the salon.

The real heroine is royal court stylist Amanda Cook Tucker, aka Mandy, who has done William and Harry's hair for years, and who also did Diana's.

Health kick: Sarah is trying to drop her bad eating habits with the help of Bodyism

It's very odd. Either there's something other than mint-flavoured chlorophyll in the Bodyism gym water, or I’m beginning to enjoy this. Three weeks in, and I remain stubbornly corpulent (32 per cent fat: I still haven’t quite recovered from that revelation); but I don't FEEL quite so exhausted.

There's a spring in my step as I waddle my way through the cigar-scented air of Knightsbridge towards my sessions.

Food-wise, things have improved too. I wouldn’t quite describe my diet as clean and lean; but I have introduced a few changes which, for now at least, don't feel too restrictive.

The first is breakfast. If I'm on the school run, it's nuts - in more ways than one. There isn't the time or the mental space to successfully deposit two nippers, clothed, fed, watered and in possession of whichever permission slip/item of sports clothing/musical instrument happens to be the order of the day AND fix myself a poached egg and avocado salad with extra-virgin-cold-pressed-super-organic-health-seed oil. So I have nuts instead.

Almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts make a fine combination. It’s not very thrilling, I know, but its much better than the children’s breakfast leftovers, and I have to admit, grudgingly, that James Duigan, creator of the Bodyism health and diet system I'm trying to follow, is right: the nuts fill me up and I don't get so hungry/sleepy at lunchtime.

Low-energy lightbulbs

New research has shown that eco-bulbs emit UVA rays, which cause premature ageing. So if you sit under one all day long, use a moisturiser with a minimum spf of 15.

The second is in the evenings. 
Night-time is when it all goes wrong. I can be well-behaved, food and 
drink-wise, all day. Then evening comes, the kids are in bed, work is 
done and it’s time to reward myself. Which means a glass of wine and 
some quality time with a pudding.

I
 do more damage between the 9  o'clock watershed and the end of 
Newsnight than at any time during the week. If I could just bring myself
 to go bed at 9pm, I would be as thin as a pin. Also, catatonically 
dull. Apparently, this is quite normal.

It was trainer Rebecca (size 6, blonde, 
beautiful, bright: your basic nightmare) who suggested I try one of 
Bodyism's many shakes, the Serenity blend.

'It's delicious,' she enthused, eyes bright as a puppy's. 'It'll stop you craving sweet things - and it will help you sleep.'

There's no way this is going to replace my tub of Tesco Finest Devon vanilla ice cream, I thought to myself grumpily as I shook the designated amount of what looked like sawdust and gerbil droppings into my blender and added full-fat milk (never drink semi-skimmed, say the bods at Bodyism: too much processing).

It was weirdly delicious. The next evening I had it hot, and it was even yummier. I did sneak just the tiniest bit of dark chocolate into it, but what the hell: it's still got to be better than ice cream.
