Cracked under pressure: Florence Thomson, arriving at Lincoln Crown Court

A grandmother was tasered by police after stabbing her husband 17 times when  she snapped under the pressure of caring for him, a court heard yesterday.

Florence Thomson, 78, had just moved home with her husband Keith, 79, who has Alzheimer’s disease, when she ‘flipped’ and repeatedly plunged a carving knife into his chest, causing him horrific injuries.

She looked ‘totally deranged’ when her daughter called in by chance after the attack, prosecutors said, and ‘had a wild look in her eyes and was covered in blood’.

Police were called, and when Mrs Thomson, who had also begun to  cut herself, refused to put the knife down, they tasered her twice.

Mr Thomson, who used to work for electronics firm Ferranti, survived despite his injuries and is being looked after at a care home. He is said to be keen to see his wife.

Mrs Thomson, who arrived at court using a Zimmer frame, yesterday escaped a jail sentence for the attack after a judge heard that years of  caring for her husband had taken their toll on her mental health.

Lincoln Crown Court heard how Mrs Thomson cracked after the couple moved to a newly built bungalow in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, from another property in the market town.

They had been married for almost 40 years but Mr Thomson’s memory had deteriorated severely since 2003.

Mrs Thomson was said to have complained in the weeks leading up to the attack that she had ‘lost him’ years before and couldn’t ‘put up with him’ for much longer.

After the attack last November, her husband was taken to intensive care in nearby King’s Lynn with ten stab wounds to his chest as well as injuries to his shoulder, hands and right thigh.

Mrs Thomson, who suffered minor injuries from the barbs of the taser, told police: ‘I love him to bits. I lost it. I just flipped my lid. You always hurt the one you love and I hurt my husband. It was because of the stress. The pressure of moving house got to me. Please, please, I’m sorry for what I’ve done. I’m not an evil person.’

Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, told the court how on the day of the attack Mrs Thomson’s daughter from a previous marriage, Sheena Pentney, called in to check that  everything was OK. She found her mother in a ‘deranged’ state and  her stepfather lying on the bedroom floor, covered in blood.

When police arrived, Mrs Thomson ‘appeared at the doorway still holding the knife’ and moved towards them, Mr Aspden said. She ignored requests to drop it, causing officers to taser her twice before arresting her on suspicion of attempted murder.

Psychiatrists who examined Mrs Thomson agreed she was ill at the time she carried out the attack. She pleaded guilty to wounding her husband with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Judge Michael Heath sentenced Mrs Thomson, who had spent five months on remand, to a two-year community order with supervision by probation officers and imposed  an indefinite restraining order which means she can visit her husband only under supervision.

He said the case was ‘highly unusual and extremely sad’, adding: 'They had been happily married for 40 years and were devoted to each other.

‘In 2003 Mr Thomson began to experience signs of memory loss. He eventually contracted dementia and it got progressively worse. She was his sole carer.

‘Caring for anyone with dementia should not be underestimated. She found herself under a great strain and contracted a depressive illness.

'Plainly at the time of this incident the balance of her mind was disturbed against a background of great domestic upheaval.

‘There are very exceptional cases when justice should be tempered with mercy. This is one of them.

'In almost every case of wounding with intent any defendant who either pleads or is found guilty can expect to receive a sentence measuring in years.

'For reasons I hope are obvious, I am satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the guidelines in this case.’

Mrs Thomson chose to make no comment after the hearing but her lawyer said she was ‘anxious to see her husband’ and that he ‘would like to see her as well’.

A neighbour of the retired couple, Jim White, 42, said yesterday: ‘To taser her twice does seem a little bit over  the top. It does make you wonder what the police would have done 20 years ago or so without these weapons.’

But Detective Inspector Dave Rimmer, of Lincolnshire Police, said: ‘The use of the taser was necessary to prevent Mrs Thomson injuring herself further, to prevent her injuring the attending officers but most critically to allow for immediate medical attention to be rendered to her husband.

‘Had the officers not acted so quickly, it is possible the injuries to Mr Thomson may have proved fatal.’
