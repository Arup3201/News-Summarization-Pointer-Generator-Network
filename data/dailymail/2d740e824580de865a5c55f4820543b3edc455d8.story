A driver claimed he could not tax his car because he had taken too much Viagra.

The motorist suggested he had been unable to leave the house to buy a new tax disc after over-dosing on the anti-impotence pill.

He was one of dozens of people who tried to avoid paying road tax for their vehicle by submitting increasingly implausible excuses.

Excuses: A claim that a driver had taken too much Viagra is among a list of silly excuses given to DVLA to explain why vehicles are not properly taxed

Almost all drivers pay to tax their vehicles or declare that it has been taken off road.

But the DVLA today released some of the silliest excuses given by people caught out for not paying their road tax.

It includes admissions that the money has been spent on betting on a horse race instead or that the person could not tax their vehicle because they had ‘man flu’ or had fallen out of a tree while picking plums.

Tax: More than 99 per cent of people do pay for a tax disc for their vehicle

Others suggested that they did not have to tax their car because it would have cost more than the vehicle was worth or their were owed more in a rebate from the taxman.

The age old school favourite – that a dog had eaten the papers – also featured on the list.

Carolyn Williams, DVLA’s head of digital services, said: ‘The vast majority of people tax their car on time but it amazes me to see the excuses people come up with.

‘It’s easier than ever before for people to tax their car and our digital services are designed to be used any time of day or night to fit in with people’s lifestyles - so there really is no need for silly excuses.’

Latest figures show that 99 per cent of vehicles are properly taxed or declared off road.

If a vehicle is not taxed or declared ‘SORN’ the owner could face a penalty fine.

If the vehicle is seen parked on a public road it could be clamped, impounded and ultimately crushed.
