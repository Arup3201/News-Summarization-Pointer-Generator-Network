This week sees the UK’s first melon juice launching — with a whole melon in every bottle.

There are two varieties of Mello, which will be launching in Ocado at a special promotional price of £1.99 throughout August and at two bottles for £4 during September. The normal price will be £2.49 for a bottle.

Mello is made from pressed melons and nothing else. There is no added water, sweeteners or preservatives — and it is low-calorie, fat-free and full of vitamins and minerals.

These includes vitamins A and C, essential for skin and hair health, and potassium, which maintains blood pressure.

It is, the makers say, great to drink after a gym work-out or to cure a hangover!

The brand’s founder, Rose Aldean, spent a year working out the best way to turn her home-made melon juice into a viable supermarket product and came across HPP — high pressure processing — as the best method. The juice is not heat pasteurised, which can destroy the vitamins, minerals and enzymes found in fruit, and it isn’t a cold-pressed juice which often need additives to stop them deteriorating.

Instead, with HPP, the melon is skinned, deseeded and juiced and the juice is then subjected to a high level of pressure.

This inactivates the micro-organisms that cause decay, while at the same time retaining the nutritional value and keeping the juice fresh throughout its shelf life.
