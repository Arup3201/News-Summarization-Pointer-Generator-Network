An adorable video has captured a service dog's play date with Pluto on a Disney Fantasy Cruise.

The video, uploaded to YouTube by a fellow traveler, shows the gorgeous fluffy white dog, Bingo, pouncing and playing with the staffer dressed as the classic Disney character.

His owner, Mark, said that his playful pooch had loved meeting Pluto.

'All my dogs think Pluto is a real dog,' Mark wrote on a Disney message board. 'He wanted to Pluto chase him really bad.'

Hello there: Bingo the service dog meets Pluto after being invited to a 'play date' on a Disney Fantasy Cruise

Playtime! Slowly Bingo begins to trust him and starts to lunge at him, as owner Mark looks on

At first, the dog is apprehensive 
about meeting the oversized character, and looks for encouragement from 
Mark, who is behind him in a wheelchair.

Slowly, Bingo begins to trust Pluto, inching closer before jumping back with a bark.

When he gets over his initial nerves, Bingo remembers his manners and sits to shake hands with Pluto - first his right and then his left - as the gathering crowd emits an 'awwww!'

By the end of the video, the boisterous dog is merrily
 hopping around his owner's wheelchair without a leash - barking at 
Pluto to encourage more fun.

After
 their play date, the new friends pose side-by-side for some photographs. 
When Pluto leans down on his front, the obedient service dog copies him 
to make the same pose.

The Disney staffer playing Pluto also fully embraced the role, scratching his sides with his feet and jumping towards his new friend - as the other dog tried to nip at his whiskers.

On Disney message boards, Mark wrote how Disney has long been welcoming to his service dogs, and that
 Bingo has always loved meeting the characters.

He also explained that he had received an invite from the character managers aboard the ship, specifically asking Bingo to join them in the atrium for a 'play date'.

The video on YouTube has so far been watched nearly 52,000 times - and has nearly as many encouraging comments.

'I love it,' one viewer wrote. 'The dog is like: you look like a dog but smell like a human, I am confused.'

'A little tempted to buy a giant dog costume!' one viewer wrote, while another added: 'This is probably the most fun this guy has had on his job.'
