Jonathan Walters made a beeline for the match ball at the final whistle. He stuffed it underneath his shirt and held it tightly as he strutted towards the tunnel.

It was a tangible reminder of his 200th appearance for Stoke, the day he scored a perfect hat-trick — one with his right foot, one with his left and a header in the 90th minute. He is the first player to achieve the feat since Kevin Nolan and Romelu Lukaku in May 2013.

‘He was magnificent the whole game,’ said manager Mark Hughes, ‘He probably doesn’t get enough credit for the effort he puts in. He gives everything every game. He is going the right way about getting a new contract.’

Harry Redknapp shook his head at the final whistle. This was his side’s fourth loss in a row, as they extended their record for the most consecutive away defeats in Premier League history, which now stands at 11.

For many, the emblem of transfer deadline day is the sight of Redknapp giving interviews to the rolling news channels out of his car window. The QPR boss said: ‘I couldn’t say we’re going to get anyone in before the deadline. Everyone’s trying but it’s not easy at this stage of the season. I don’t know whether Emmanuel Adebayor is a possibility but he’d do for us.’ Redknapp was encouraged by his side’s second-half performance. Eduardo Vargas nearly scored a showstopper equaliser on 57 minutes but his scissor kick effort was well saved by Asmir Begovic.

‘It looks with a 3-1 scoreline like you’ve been well beat but that isn’t the case. At 2-1 at half-time I said I thought we could win. They were hanging on for grim life.’

A glum looking Roy Keane was in the stands, a day after allegedly unleashing a barrage of verbal abuse to a taxi driver who told him to ‘smile’. Perhaps a grin was elicited from the heavily bearded Republic of Ireland assistant manager by the sight of his players Stephen Ireland and Walters combining so well.

For the first, goal, Ireland’s neat back-heel pass set up his countryman for a simple finish. The two players collaborated again to double the home side’s lead. They exchanged passes twice before Ireland pulled the ball back across goal for Walters to score with a cool finish.

Nico Kranjcar, who clearly enjoys a trip to the Potteries, pulled one back for QPR with his third goal in as many games at the Britannia.

But Walters sealed the victory with a header after the ball bounced kindly for him in the box.

At the double: Stoke find themselves two goals ahead thanks to Walters' second goal of the game

A glum looking Roy Keane was in the stands at the Britannia, a day after allegedly unleashing a barrage of verbal abuse to a taxi driver who told him to ‘smile.’

Perhaps a grin was elicited from the heavily bearded Republic of Ireland manager by the crucial role his compatriot Stephen Ireland played in the two Stoke goals.

For the first, it was his neat back heel pass that set up Walters for a relatively simple finish. Ireland stole the ball from under Karl Henry’s nose after some miserable QPR defending and directed it towards Walters whose powerful right footed finish sailed past Rob Green to put.

That goal enlivened the game after a dire opening 20 minutes, with routine passes going astray and the icy wind whipping in from the open edged stadium making it difficult to retain possession.

Not that it was having a detrimental effect on Ireland and Walters who again collaborated superbly to double the home side’s lead.

They exchanged the ball twice before midfielder Ireland, 28, unselfishly pulled the ball back across goal.

QPR defender Nedum Onuoha scrambled back but could do nothing to prevent Walters netting his ninth goal of the season – six in the league - with a cool headed finish from six yards out.

Nico Kranjcar, who clearly enjoys a trip to the Potteries, pulled one back for QPR with his third goal in as many games at the Britannia.

The visitors demonstrated much more of their attacking threat in the second half.

Eduardo Vargas nearly scored a showstopper equaliser on 57 minutes but his scissor kick effort was well saved by Asmir Begovic. 

Joey Barton then smacked the underside of the crossbar with a free kick from 25 yards out. Begovic made a comfortable but crucial save of a fizzing Leroy Fer free kick from 30 yards out as the visitors pushed for a point to take back to West London in the closing minutes.

But Walters sealed the victory with a diving header after the ball bounced kindly for him in the box.
