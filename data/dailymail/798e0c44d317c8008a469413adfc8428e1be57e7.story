The beginning of Major League Soccer's 20th season cannot come quickly enough for its newest, and arguably most highly anticipated, member.

Ever since Manchester City announced that NYCFC would help form the American branch of the all-encompassing City Football Group (CFG) empire, huge doubts of skepticism have rained over the Big Apple and beyond.

When someone like Sheikh Mansour, whose personal wealth stretches towards £20billion, becomes involved with a sporting venture it's natural to assume huge swathes of spending will swiftly follow.

After all, there is no institution on planet football which has the kind of structure CFG have attempted to build. The Yokohama F-Marinos were purchased last May while Melbourne City are enjoying the fruits of their Abu Dhabi association.

NYCFC manager Jason Kreis and his squad enjoyed time rubbing shoulders and tapping into Manuel Pellegrini's knowledge last month. A simply priceless opportunity not afforded to others.

Yet MLS doesn't operate like the Barclays Premier League, or anywhere else for that matter. The Sheik's incredible £1.2b investment in Manchester will not be replicated here. With strict, and at times mind-numbingly convoluted, rules ensuring spending doesn't exceed strict guidelines, NYCFC haven't been able to scour the world and bring a bucket load of superstars to Manhattan.

Kreis was swiftly brought in by former City midfielder Claudio Reyna who is now the club's sporting director. Forty-two-year-old Kreis is highly rated in the US following an impressive seven year-spell with Real Salt Lake City where he won the MLS Cup in 2009.

With the franchise being based in New York City, a place where the biggest names come to play, the money men in the Middle East were acutely aware just how important it was to bring excitement to the table.

Putting bums on seats was vital - a view not shared by the New York Red Bulls. Star men Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill have not been replaced with faith placed in younger, hungrier players. The natives at the Red Bull Arena are far from happy.

NYCFC though knew big names had to arrive especially at the inception with a temporary home at Yankee's Stadium in the Bronx not the ideal base to spend the first three years. A soccer specific stadium is in the pipeline – yet, as David Beckham is finding out in Miami, locating real estate for sporting venues in major US cities is anything but straightforward.

So in came David Villa and, protractedly, Frank Lampard.

Both stellar signings tap into the fervent, cosmopolitan football fanbase here. Villa ticks all the boxes for the Spanish speaking fans who pack the bars when Barcelona and Real Madrid strut their stuff in La Liga.

Providing the 33-year-old steers clear of injury, it would be a shock if the former Barcelona forward doesn't get 20 goals or more. The slow paced, pretty much Championship standard of MLS will ensure a player of his class will provide defences with more than their fair share of nightmares. Expect him to drop deep, yet still cause all manner of problems in Kreis' preferred diamond formation.

Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be there and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out'

Lampard too will have fun even if his signing was woefully handled by all concerned. New Yorkers are not used to being forced to settle for second best. And they wasted no time in showing their discontent.

With the former Chelsea midfielder's name plastered all over billboards along with Villa, his arrival was the trigger which helped secure 14,000 season tickets sales.

Naturally when news broke of his decision to stay in the Premier League until the end of the season, there was anger. And understandably so. City hoodwinked MLS commissioner Don Garber who, for someone who rules with such autonomy, was shown to be a touch naive throughout the whole 'will he, won't he' saga which always looked like having an outcome which wouldn't benefit New York.

The fury, though, also indicated there are people who already care. 

When kick-off arrives on Sunday at a sell-out 60,000 in Orlando, Lampard won't be on their minds

Yet when kick-off arrives on Sunday at a sell-out 60,000 againt fellow new franchise Orlando City, Lampard won't be at the forefront of anyone's thoughts.

With US midfielder Mix Diskerud signing from Rosenbourg, Kreis is building a strong core while a contingent from South America and Europe add flair excitement - and something of the unknown.

'We have players who want to play, who like to play one and two touch and excite the crowd, ' said  24-year-old Diskerud, who was part of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad last summer.

'I definitely think that we are starting history here.'

With the Red Bulls based in New Jersey – a minimum 30-minute train ride away from Manhattan – NYCFC have advertised aggressively to make their mark.

Brazilian star Kaka will play for the new MLS franchise Orlando City, who NYCFC face on Sunday

Community projects have flourished for the past two years following the creation of the City soccer schools in Harlem while the tie-in with the New York Yankees – one of the most famous and iconic sporting brands in the world – should not be underestimated.

Building a team which will be competitive won't be easy. Cohesion takes time. Yet if the honeymoon period stretches over a few victories, who knows where the feel good factor could take City's latest potshot at glory.

An indelible mark has already been made off the pitch.

Now's the time to start producing on it. 

Kaka - Orlando City SC

The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass.

Frank Lampard – New York City FC

One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City.

Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy

The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane.

David Villa - New York City FC

Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season.

Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls

Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.
