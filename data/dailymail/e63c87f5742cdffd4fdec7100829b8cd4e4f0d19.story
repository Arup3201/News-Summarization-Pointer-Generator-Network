Jailed for three years: Theressa Morrisroe, 51, of Northampton, made over 80 fraudulent payments over a three-year period while working for a charity

An accounts clerk who defrauded a charity out of more than £100,000 by paying money into her seriously ill father’s bank account has been jailed for three years.

Theressa Morrisroe, 51, of Northampton, made more than 80 fraudulent payments over a three-year period while working for the Motor Neurone Disease Association in the town.

But she was caught after a supplier contacted the charity about an unpaid invoice last June, with investigations finding the money had been paid into an account belonging to her father.

The charity then discovered payments to another 22 suppliers had been siphoned into this account without the knowledge of her father, whom she cared for full-time.

Even after leaving the charity in 2013, Morrisroe then went on to defraud a company called Phoenix IT out of more than £24,000. 

She spent all of the money or gave most it away to family members. Morrisroe pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and was jailed yesterday at Northampton Crown Court.

But despite pocketing more than £124,000, Morrisroe was not ordered to pay any compensation or costs after Judge Lynn Tayton heard she had ‘no realisable assets’.

Ayesha Bell-Paris, prosecuting, told the court Morrisroe had worked for the MND Association as a purchase ledger clerk between 2006 and 2013.

But she abused her position and made 80 fraudulent transactions into her father’s account and her own during a three-year period between 2010 and 2013.

Caught: A supplier contacted the Motor Neurone Disease Association (based in Northampton, above) about an unpaid invoice, with investigations finding the cash had been paid into an account belonging to her father

The court heard Morrisroe’s crimes were only uncovered a year after she left the charity.

Miss Bell-Paris said: ‘Investigations revealed that 22 different suppliers had made payments into the defendant’s father’s account. Other payments had also been made into her own account.’

A victim impact statement read out to the court from Linda Cherrington, head of finance at the MND Association, said Morrisroe’s crimes had left her colleagues ‘visibly shocked and upset’.

She added: ‘All her colleagues at the charity have struggled to believe "one of the family" could have so persistently abused her position of trust as a member of the finance team.

‘They have all been rocked and visibly upset by the fact a long-term member of staff - on the surface a conscientious and enthusiastic colleague - could be able to defraud the MND Association out of more than £100,000.’

In her police interview, Morrisroe, who was paid a salary of £22,000 a year at the MND Association, said she had stolen the money because she was suffering financial problems

She also told officers that she ‘hated everyone at the charity as they had been horrible to her.’

Stephen Evans, defending, said the accounts clerk had financial issues and had been supporting her father, brother and son.

He added: ‘She was someone who felt making the payments to family members would demonstrate she was needed. She is desperately ashamed and knows the gravity of what she did. She has nothing materially as she lives in a rental property. She lives a rather sad, isolated existence.’

The court heard the MND Association has managed to claim back just under £100,000 due to having insurance that covers employee theft.

But the charity said almost £10,000 had been spent investigating the fraud which had caused considerable damage to their reputation.

Speaking after the case, Martin Gosling, a fraud investigator at Northamptonshire Police, said Morrisroe had committed a ‘heinous crime’.

Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association said: ‘Fortunately, our support for people living with MND was not affected by this fraud and I am pleased to say that the financial loss to the Association was reimbursed by our insurance providers.

‘Our systems have also since then been vigorously externally reviewed and found to be as robust as possible moving forward. I would like to thank everyone who continues to support the MND Association by sharing awareness or by raising vital funds to bring us closer to a cure.’
