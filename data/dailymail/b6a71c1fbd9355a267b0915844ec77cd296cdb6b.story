It’s a country as revered for its fine whisky as it is for its breath-taking landscape.

But when it came to creating a scent that managed to evoke the splendour of Scotland, creators perhaps wisely chose the latter.

Heathrow Airport has developed a new fragrance based on the heather that lines the Scottish Highlands, and which they are now pumping out in Terminal 2.

The Heathrow  'Scent Globe' sprays aromas associated with different countries, including Scotland

Bosses hope that the aroma, created by ScentAir, will inspire travellers passing through the airport’s departure lounge to visit the country.

The move comes after the launch of Heathrow’s Scent Globe in November – a large dispenser that sprays aromas associated with different countries.

Perched in the departure lounge, the orb has already offered curious globetrotters exotic scents designed to evoke images of Thailand, South Africa, Japan, China and Brazil.

The selection of destinations were chosen for their popularity with Heathrow passengers.

To conjure up the essence of the nations, Heathrow worked with Design in Scent to produce tailor-made fragrances from ingredients associated with the designated country.

South Africa's smell captures the adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense and wild grass, while Brazil's scent oozes rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine.

Japan is brought to life through cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris, capturing the essence of coastal villages synonymous with the great Pacific Island.

For China, developers used ‘mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion', while Thailand used lemongrass, ginger and coconut.

Because of the popularity of the experiment, bosses suggested creating a scent that was connected to the UK.

Scotland’s scent is called ‘Flower of Scotland’ and will be used at the airport over the course of this week.

A Heathrow spokesman said: ‘With around 13 million passengers a year using Heathrow as their gateway to Britain’s regions, in particular Scotland, it is no surprise that the next scent to be chosen to tantalise passengers over this festive period is "Flower of Scotland".

‘With 255 weekly departures to Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland is by far one of the airport’s favourite destinations.

‘The aroma of the heather capped highlands and the crisp loch air will be smelt throughout Terminal 2’s walkways and public areas.'

The spokesman added: ‘Heathrow hopes the scent will encourage passengers to explore not only the exotic destinations the airport connects to but the wonderful hidden gems Britain itself has to offer.’

'Flower of Scotland’ can be enjoyed until the end of the week when it will be replaced with festive fragrances to get passengers Christmas mood that capture the aromas of freshly cut Christmas trees through to more traditional concoctions of wild berries, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla.
