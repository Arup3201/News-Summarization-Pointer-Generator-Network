The husband of missing Utah mother Susan Cox Powell has accused her parents of turning the couple's children against him.

Josh Powell has asked that the courts place his two sons, aged four and six, with a guardian as his in-laws have an ‘irrational vendetta’ against him.

‘The Coxes are coaching my sons in ways that are clearly intended to destroy our loving relationships as a natural family unit,’ Josh Powell wrote in a court declaration that he filed in Pierce County, Washington.

‘By living in the Cox house, the boys are exposed to the Coxes' overwhelming attitude of hatred toward me and it is seriously traumatizing my children,’ he wrote.

‘There is considerable evidence that the Coxes make explicit comments to and around my sons reflecting their attitude.’

He said that by being with his in-laws, his sons ‘are caught in the middle of a very hostile war of words and emotions’.

Susan Powell was reported from her West Valley City home on December 7, 2009, when she failed to show up for work as a stockbroker at Wells Fargo Financial. A body has never been found.

Her husband is the only named person of interest in the case but has never been charged or arrested.

He said he took his young sons, then 
four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. He 
believes his wife ran off with another man.

Susan Powell's parents have had custody of the children since September.

They had previously been living with their father and grandfather, but were removed from the house after their grandfather, Steve Powell, was charged with voyeurism and possession of child pornography.

Steve Powell has pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of voyeurism and one of possession of child pornography. He remains jailed on $200,000 bail.

The arrest prompted a Cox family lawyer 
to directly accuse Josh - for the first time publicly - of involvement 
in his wife's disappearance.

'The time has come where we have to stop playing cat and mouse games: Josh Powell had something to do with the disappearance of the mother of these children,' attorney Steve Downing said.

Powell responded: 'Everything they said is patently false. I am a good father to my sons.'

No one has been charged in Susan Powell's disappearance, and police say the case remains an active investigation.

Since his wife's disappearance, Powell, 
who still wears his wedding ring, has claimed his wife suffered from 
mental illness and plotted her own disappearance.

He has denied killing her or having anything to do with her disappearance.

'I would never even hurt her,' a tearful, red-eyed Josh Powell told CBS' Early Show in August.

Josh and his father have said they believe Susan Powell ran off with another man.

'I'm still thinking she left,' Steven 
Powell told The Associated Press in August. 'Hopefully they'll be able 
to find her at some point... We don't believe she's dead.'

In July, Steve Powell, who claims his 
daughter-in-law was in love with him, announced that he planned to 
publish her private journal online.

‘People don't know that there are two 
distinct sides of Susan. She was very ... kind of an open person in a 
sexual way ... with the opposite sex,’ he said.

No trace: She was reported missing from her Utah home exactly two years ago

Susan's parents have always defended their daughter in the press and have made it clear they suspect foul play in her disappearance.

‘My clients are under a court order in the family law case not to discuss the matter,’ the Coxes attorney, Anne Bremner told the Huffington Post in response to Josh Powell's latest allegations. ‘I can say that the boys are in a loving and safe home.’
