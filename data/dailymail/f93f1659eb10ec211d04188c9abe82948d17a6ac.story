Barefoot and hungry, he honed his skills on the squalid streets of a red light district in India.

Now 16-year-old ‘slumdog’ soccer protégé Rajib Roy is dreaming of becoming a millionaire – after being chosen to train with Manchester United.

He impressed the Red Devils’ scouts during a school football tournament in Goa last month and, with 11 other talented young players spotted in India, arrives at the Premier League club’s Old Trafford ground tomorrow for 15 days of training with its coaches.

Dazzling dribbler: Rajib Roy, 16, from Kolkata, West Bengal, is set to arrive in Manchester this weekend to take part in a training camp at Old Trafford after being spotted by talent scouts

Rajib is pictured with his few possessions in the family's single-room home in the Kolkata slum, the largest red light district in Asia, where he grew up with his prostitute mother and younger brother

Family support: Rajib's mother Rekha, an impoverished sex worker, helped him along his way to football success by sending him to a local school for children of women in her profession

Rajib’s mother used to be a sex worker
 and now toils in a handbag factory for just £30 a month. He has no idea
 who his father is.

Yesterday,
 he said: ‘People keep asking me how it feels to be my mother’s son and 
then achieve something like this. I don’t know how to answer that 
question.

‘But when my coach told me I had been selected by Manchester United it was like a father’s recognition.’

Rajib
 – a striker said to have dazzling dribbling skills – shares a single 
room with his mother Rekha and younger brother in the notorious 
Sonagachi suburb of Calcutta, where thousands of women are forced to 
sell their bodies in order to survive.

On
 the wall is a poster of Chelsea’s Brazilian star Oscar – whom the 
youngster idolises because he also comes from a background of poverty. 
Rajib often had to survive on a half-empty stomach to keep his soccer 
hopes alive as he  practised for hours on the streets as a child.

‘With
 the money my mother would give me to buy food, I would purchase 
football boots and jerseys. It was tough, but I was determined to 
achieve my goal,’ he told the  Times of India.

‘I
 used to watch the bigger kids play and realised I wanted to be like 
them. I started playing, and then I saw matches being played on 
television.

‘I wanted to be like those big players and dedicated myself to realising this dream.’

Baller: The 16-year-old football talent is seen playing barefoot with children during his football practice at a local park in Kolkata

Knows his stuff: The teenager is an obsessed Manchester United fan and often uses the little money he is given for lunch to go watch the games

Fighting prejudice: At his previous school, Rajib was relentlessly bullied because of his mother's profession and now attends Rahul Vidya Niketan in Sealdah, a special school for the children of sex workers, where he is part of the school's football team

Humble beginnings: Rajib is pictured with his mother Rekha in the small single room they share in Sonagachi, the suburb known as Kolkata's red light district, which is home to 12,000 sex workers and their families

Move on up: Rajib's skills as a football player has opened up new doors for him and his family to reduce their level of poverty

His
 life changed two years ago when his mother sent him to the local Rahul 
Vidya Niketan school for children of sex workers and he took part in a 
soccer project that aimed to integrate them into mainstream society.

Rajib
 was part of the West Bengal team to win the National Slum Soccer 
Tournament in Nagpur earlier this year. Last month, he and 30 others 
were selected to take part in the championship in Goa where  the 
Manchester United scouts  spotted him.

Rajib’s
 friend Arko Dey, 17, whose mother ekes out a living selling potato and 
flour snacks from a street stall, has also been chosen  to train at the 
club, where the  star players include England  strikers Wayne Rooney 
and  Danny Welbeck.

Arko said his mother wept after hearing he had been picked. ‘We live in abject poverty,’ he said.

‘She knows nothing about Manchester United.’

A new chance: Rajib Roy holds up his passport and the letter from Manchester United assuring UK Border officials that he has indeed been invited to come and train at Old Trafford

Rajib, who has no idea who his father is, stands in the doorway of his home in the Sonagachi suburb of Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, in West Bengal

Change of scenery: The talented striker learned to play football on these streets in the West Bengal slum he calls home, but is set to swap them for Old Trafford this weekend

Close to goal: The 16-year-old is one of 11 teens arriving in the UK this weekend to spend two weeks training with Manchester United's coaches after being spotted at a national tournament for young players in India

Among
 other things they will get a free tour of the world-famous stadium 
which normally costs £20 - the monthly income of Rajib's family.

Rajib said: ‘People keep asking me how it feels to be my mother's son and then achieve something like this.

‘I don't know how to answer that question.

‘But when my coach told me I had been selected by Manchester United it was like a father's recognition.’

He
 added: ‘My mother is a very shy person. She would lock me in my room 
after lunch so that I could take a nap, but I would quietly sneak out to
 play with my friends.

‘Last
 month I was selected along with 30 others to participate in a camp in 
Goa through a nationwide school championship competition.

‘I arrived late because I took a train from Kolkata. Everybody else took a flight.

Football for life: Rajib, centre, is pictured with his friends in the Kolkata slum where they grew up

High hopes: Although he dreams of playing Premiere League football for Manchester United, Rajib hopes that his football talents will help him earn money to put his younger brother in a  good school

Rajib has been attending the local Rahul Vidya Niketan school for the children of prostitutes, pictured, for two years, which is how he was finally able to play organised football

The founder of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, whose aim is to improve the lives of sex workers and their families, Dr Samarjit Jana set up the football initiative which helped Rajib win a place at the Manchester United training camp

The
 teen admits he often spent the little money his mother gives him to buy
 lunch on watching football tournaments elsewhere in the city.

Dr.
 Jana said: ‘Rajib's dream is to build career in football. He wants to 
play in the English Premier league and his favorite team is Manchester 
United.

‘One of his other 
goals is to help his nine year-old brother get into an English medium 
school so he can develop a better academic career.’

Dr. Jana added: ‘We started a football academy on a very small scale four years ago.

‘It provides training for children of marginalised communities such as sex workers and construction workers.

‘Out of 11 boys selected from this eastern part of India by Manchester United two of them are from our community.

‘There are five million sex workers in India and we are just providing a minority of them, and their families, with a chance.

‘This shows that if you give them the opportunities they have a chance of success and I'm sure other boys will follow them.’
