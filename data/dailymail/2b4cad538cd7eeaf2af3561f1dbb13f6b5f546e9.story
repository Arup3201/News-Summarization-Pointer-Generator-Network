Matt Stevens has dismissed the notion that scrummaging is a ‘dark art’ and has called on officials to sharpen up so less time is spent re-setting the set-piece.

Many spectators are left frustrated by the number of stoppages that - despite new IRB regulations to reduce the number of collapsed scrums - disrupt the flow of play and cause games to run well beyond 80 minutes.

With 39 appearances in the England front row to his name, Stevens is in a strong position to comment. The new regulations put more emphasis on pre-binding than a powerful engagement and the former Saracens prop believes more clarity is needed with the referees.

‘I think there are a lot of good points about the new scrummaging laws,’ said Stevens. ‘We’ve got hookers hooking again and we’ve got scrums generally staying up more than when we had just a full out hit without the bind. It would be good to speed them up a bit, but how do we do that?

‘I hate this ‘dark arts’ label of no-one knowing what’s going on. If you speak to any bio-kinnetist of physiologist, it’s all about body positions and power vectors. If you’re a referee at the highest level today, you’ve got to know exactly what’s going on. It’s not an excuse to say that it’s just the front row so no one knows, because it’s not actually that difficult. It’s just a perception.’

The new regulations surrounding the collision at the scrum are also intended to reduce injury. A report in the British Journal of sports medicine found that in the 2011/12 Aviva Premiership season, before the new rules were introduced, 88 per cent of scrum-related injuries fell upon those in the front row.

But England still have a high injury toll among their forwards – with Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero all among the front row absentees – and Stevens believes the added emphasis on scrummaging in the northern hemisphere is a root of the problem.

‘The Premiership is the toughest competition in world rugby in terms of playing good teams week in week out,’ said Stevens. ‘There’s not a huge amount of rest time and more you’ve got a set piece battle every single weekend. In Super Rugby there are big dynamic back lines and big physical ball carriers, but in the Premiership you’ve an extremely physical pack to deal with. I think it takes its toll.

‘I don’t know the nature of all of England’s injuries, but Cole’s is a neck injury, which is a scrummaging injury. He played a huge amount of Test rugby early on in his career. You battle it out you eventually get injured. In professional rugby that’s what happens.’
