A California mom has been arrested for leaving her two toddlers inside her car while she went gambling.

Phaley Nget, 37, of Oakland, is facing child endangerment charges after cops discovered her daughters inside her unattended car across the street from Casino 580 in Livermore.

The kids, ages 2 and 3, had been inside the locked vehicle in 75-degree heat for some 30 minutes before a passerby called the cops.

Authorities said temperatures inside the vehicle were reaching more than 81 degrees and rising.

'When we arrived, one of the children was crying,' Officer Traci Rebiejo, of the Livermore Police Department, told KTVU-TV.

Nget avoided the Casino parking lot and used blankets to cover the car's partially cracked windows.

'Maybe she was trying to conceal the kids in the car so no 
one else could see there was children in the car or maybe was she was 
trying to keep some of the heat out of the car,' Rebiejo told the station.

Cover up: Nget left her car windows partially cracked and covered with blankets, which police say was an attempt to keep passersby from seeing her daughters trapped inside

Officers tracked Nget down and found her inside the casino's card room. She was arrested and hauled to Santa Rita County Jail, the Contra Costa Times reported.

Casino 580 patron Jessica Guerrero told KGO-TV she recognized Nget and that she gambles there 'quite a bit.'

'I wouldn't even leave my dog in the car for 10 minutes out here, let alone my kids,' Guerrero added.

Nget is being held on $200,000 bail.

The children were not injured. They were taken into protective custody.
