Manchester City's top foreign footballers are learning the English language by watching children's television shows, it has been revealed today.

The Premier League club reportedly gives its new signings language packs when they arrive, which allegedly suggest they watch CBeebies and shows such as In The Night Garden.

And the unusual method seems to be working - with Argentinian striker Sergio Aguero surprising fans in an interview recently by speaking English.

During the interview, the sportsman, who signed to the club in 2011, said his English was 'getting better every day'.

Two of the club's new Spanish signings, Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo, are believed to be watching Teletubbies and Balamory in a bid to improve their language skills.

A source told The Sun: 'City recognise the importance of players speaking English, which will help them both on and off the pitch.

'The club lays on tutors who help the players and these packs assist them with learning.

'The children's TV shows are useful for the players to learn English. Some of the players enjoy watching them more than their kids.'

It is thought that player are also advised not to watch football programmes from their native countries - and instead watch English language broadcasters.

The source added: 'Instead, they're advised to watch La Liga on Sky Sports so they can pick up football jargon.'

The news comes as the club reveals Alvaro Negredo has been helping Manchester school children to learn Spanish.

In a video on the club's website the striker can be seen teaching children to say simple phrases such as 'What is the weather like in Spain?'.

He later speaks, albeit in Spanish, about how he likes working with young people and teaching them a skill.

The move is part of the City in the Community project, which aims to forge links between the club and the surrounding area.Â
