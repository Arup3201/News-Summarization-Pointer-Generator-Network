QPR defender Rio Ferdinand revealed that although he loves reality TV, he would never appear on it himself.

The 35-year-old said that he loved shows like Gogglebox and The Fried Chicken Shop, but starring in them is another matter altogether.

In The Sun’s serialisation of his autobiography #2sides , Ferdinand said: 'You will never see me on Strictly (Come Dancing) ever, no chance. I know David Seaman and Robbie Savage have, but it's just not me.'

But the former Manchester United star did study ballet as a child and Ferdinand said people still think of him as something of a dancer.

'People really think it really is me,' he said. 'A lot of people talk to me about my retirement and ask if they'll see me on strictly. No chance. Nor I'm a Celeb - I don't like spiders, rats or snakes.' 

Ferdinand did admit to enjoying some of his experiences with TV, though. 

In 2006 the former international defender starred in  Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups - a show where he played pranks on England team-mates before declaring that they had been 'merked'.

He said: 'I want to do some more comedy. I can do it better when I retire and take more time with it. Maybe pranks. I enjoy stuff like that and the response it got was unbelievable.'
