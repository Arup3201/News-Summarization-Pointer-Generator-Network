A 45-ton humpback whale entangled with heavy crab line and buoys for more than a week in Hawaii waters is finally free.

A response team cut away several hundred feet of fishing line from the 45-foot-long whale's tail using a pole equipped with a knife, according to the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary.

Their inflatable craft came within ten feet of the marine mammal as it sidled up next to it during the rescue attempt along the leeward coast of Maui.

Once released from the line, the whale swam free with only a small piece of line lodged in a wound remaining, but the fragment will fall off as the would heals, said Ed Lyman, Large Whale Entanglement Response Coordinator for the sanctuary.

The entangled whale was first spotted on the afternoon of February 13, 45 miles northwest of Hilo, according to the Star Advertiser.

The whale's conditions were documented and a tag was attached to it so it could be tracked on satellite by the West Hawaii Marine Mammal Response Network.

It was not seen again until Sunday and was reportedly carrying a red buoy along the Kona Coast.

But as the whale moved into unreachable waters with treacherous currents near south Point, the sanctuary had to halt plans for a rescue effort last Monday, as they stood down and waited for weather conditions to improve, according to West Hawaii Today.

From Tuesday to Thursday, the whale was tracked traveling around the Big Island before being seen again Thursday evening off Maui's south shore.

Males measure between 40 and 48 feet, while females measure between 45 and 50 feet.

They can weigh between 25 and 40 tons.

Their flippers are very long, usually between a quarter and a third of their body length; and their tails can be as long as 18-ft wide. 

They live mostly in polar to tropical waters, including in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.

Humpbacks migrate at three to nine mph and can travel over 3,100 miles  during each seasonal migration.

On average, these incredible creatures have a life expectancy between 45 and 50 years. 

The following morning, a response team  assembled at Maalaea Harbor.

When the response team on the rescue vessel arrived just before 8am, they found the whale's fluke tangled in at least five wraps of gauge line, according to the NOAA.

Crew held the line and attached more buoys to keep the whale from diving and at surface level, while they successfully cut the line. 

'There was no sudden thrashing. It would trumpet blow, which is a sign of stress,'  said Lyman. 

'It definitely wasn't happy with us being there. It didn't understand.'

Tissue samples were taken from the animal to determine its health before it was let go, and the rescue vessel returned to the harbor at 2.30pm.

Entanglements like this could result in drowning, starvation, infections and increased susceptibility to ship strikes, according to authorities.
