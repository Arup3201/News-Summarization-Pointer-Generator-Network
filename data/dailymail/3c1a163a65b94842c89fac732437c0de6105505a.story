Many people are instead opting for showers lasting less than 30 seconds

More than a quarter of Britons never have a bath, surprising new figures have revealed.

Millions opt for quick, effective showers, which can often last for no more than 30 seconds each morning.

The change is being led by youngsters and affects areas as far apart as Northern Ireland and south-east England.

A survey by Homebase shows that, today, on average, over 26 per cent of the population never has a bath which rises to one third in London and the South East.

The figure rises as high as 35 per cent in Northern Ireland. 

The trend away from having a soak  is spread equally between men and women but affects mostly a younger generation, aged between 18 and 24.

More worryingly for the health conscious among us 17 per cent of the population will spend less than 30 seconds enjoying a shower every morning.

Homebase Marketing Director Jo Kenrick said: 'An entire generation is missing out on a spectacular sensation which our grand parents took for granted.

'However, such is the pace of modern life, that a ritual which has lasted for centuries is in risk of falling out of favour in just two decades.'

People in Northern Ireland are the least likely to bathe, with 35 per cent saying they can't find the time
