Citigroup's chief economist was today scolded by a judge in New York for contacting his alleged stalker weeks after she was arrested for harassing him.

Willem Buiter was ‘admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an ‘invitation to connect’ to Heleen Mees via business networking website LinkedIn.

He had also contacted her on Skype just weeks before she was charged with allegedly sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages.

The judge’s comments came as the full extent of Mees’ alleged stalking was revealed in court papers which showed she followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel.

She also sent Mr Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, a message which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’.

Citigroup economist: Willem Buiter was 'admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an 'invitation to connect' to Heleen Mees via business networking website LinkedIn

Mees, 44, appeared at the Manhattan Criminal Court wearing four-inch grey suede stilettos, a tight-fitting navy knee length pencil skirt and a grey top with a grey cardigan draped over her shoulders.

Prosecutors say that her obsessive behavior lasted between 2009 and last month during which time she bombarded Mr Buiter, 63, with at least 164 Facebook messages, hundreds of phone calls and 68 requests to meet him for a drink in one month.

Some of the emails were sexual such as a request to 'also send him naked pictures of other women'.

But others were more disturbing such as a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky'.

In the criminal complaint against her Mr Buiter says: ‘In May 2010, the defendant tried to meet with me at my hotel in Beijing, China, and in January 2013, the defendant tried to meet me at my hotel in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by using a fake name.

‘On May 6, 2013, the defendant came to my apartment building in the County and State of New York, and tried to be let up to my apartment.’

Mees’ lawyer Ira London told the court that the reality was in fact very different.

He said that the affair was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British citizenship.

Mr Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter on February 27 but Mr London said that on June 19 he contacted his client on Skype.

Mr Buiter disconnected his alleged stalker as a contact on Skype on June 23 but three days later he reconnected her.

first criminal complaint was filed. Among the allegations was that she 
harassed Mr Buiter's children from his first marriage, David, 22, and 
Elizabeth, 19

Mr London told the court that this behavior ‘only served to illustrate that this was a bilateral relationship and not harassment'.

Mees was arrested on July 1 when the first criminal complaint was filed. Among the allegations was that she harassed Mr Buiter's children from his first marriage, David, 22, and Elizabeth, 19.

An amended complaint was sent on August 5 removing the allegation that Mr Buiter's children were harassed.

The message to Mees from Mr Buiter via LinkedIn was sent two days later.

It is not clear if he sent it or the message was automated but Judge Quinones made it clear that regardless she was unimpressed.

Judge Quinones told the prosecutor: 'The People will admonish the complainant witness (Mr Buiter) that he is not to contact this defendant in any way'.

During a testy exchange she raised her voice to Mees to ask that she understood she was to have 'absolutely no contact' with Mr Buiter and his wife under the terms of a protection order.

She demurely replied: 'Yes'.

Mr London failed in an attempt to have Mees’ £3,200 bail lifted despite telling the court she had an apartment in Brooklyn worth $1.5m of which $1m was in equity.

He also told the court that after her arrest she was sacked from her job as a professor at New York University’s Public Service school, though she has since had interviews with two other universities.

Mees has yet to plead to five counts of harassment and stalking. She will next appear before the court on October 24.

Among the other allegations against her is that she targeted Mr Buiter's wife, Anne Sibert, a professor of economics at the University of London’s Birkbeck college.

Mr Buiter, who was not in court yesterday, says in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for the safety of my wife and my children.’

Mees’ has a chequered history and according to reports in the Dutch media she is a feminist activist who  once wrote a pornographic story for a literary magazine.

Speaking after the hearing Mr London said Mees is ‘emotionally distraught’ and said her relationship with Mr Buiter had been ‘intimate’.

He said: ‘She had feelings for Mr Buiter and those feelings have been trampled on’, adding that when he contacted her on LinkedIn it made her ‘more distraught than she was’.
