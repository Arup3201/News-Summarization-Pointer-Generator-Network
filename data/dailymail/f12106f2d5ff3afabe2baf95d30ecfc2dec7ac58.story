Randy Lerner waited a considerable time before dismissing Paul Lambert, their close relationship making the American keep faith when supporters had long given up.

But, with Aston Villa in the relegation zone and 13 Premier League games to go, the club’s owner cannot afford too much deliberation with his next decision.

Despite no little talent, the players look bereft of confidence and ideas. Some are not pulling their weight. An instant injection of impetus is needed if Villa are to avert the impending disaster of relegation to the Championship.

Step forward Tim Sherwood? Ever since leaving Tottenham at the end of last season he has been the man near the top of every vacancy list.

His availability in a sparse field of credible managers made him a candidate for the jobs at West Bromwich Albion, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Now he is the favourite to step into the Villa Park hotseat.

His Premier League experience amounts to just five months in charge at Tottenham, but he left White Hart Lane with the highest win ratio (59 per cent) of any manager at the club in the Premier League era.

He was a compelling character and forceful personality, unafraid to speak his mind to a formidable boss in Daniel Levy.

Villa need a spark to lift the mood and generate a turnaround in results. Judging from his time in north London, Sherwood would provide that.

Lambert, understandably tired after three seasons of continual struggle, had resorted to using clichés when talking about the challenge ahead for Villa. ’13 cup finals,’ he said of the remaining Premier League matches. It was the same term he used last season.

The squad need to hear a different voice, an opinion that will compel and inspire. Tactically too, their play has been muddled. The switch from direct football to a possession-based game seemed like a sensible plan for long-term stability but has resulted in tedious fare. Just 12 goals in 25 games is a statistic that even those averse to data crunching can comprehend as terminal.

Sherwood displayed at Spurs his ability to generate a lift in results and a good style, improving players and handing debuts to younger talents.

He does not yet have the UEFA Pro Licence coaching qualification required by the Premier League but has been working towards it with the Welsh FA and that should satisfy the authorities. Sherwodd has his UEFA A and B qualifications.

The problem has come in each of his rumoured reprisals when discussions turn to wages. At West Brom last summer, he looked on course for the job until demanding £2.5million a year, plus sizeable packages for his assistants.

A man who knows his worth, you might say. And that is fair enough. Still being paid by Tottenham as part of his severance package, Sherwood does not have to accept less than what he feels is his value.

His reunion with Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand at QPR hit the buffers in similar circumstances, though, a job that seemed tailor made.

Villa, with its history and financial stability, represents a better long-term bet – and there is a growing sense Sherwood needs to take an opportunity before it is too late.

For the right man, Lerner will find the necessary funds. Desperate to avoid relegation to the Championship, and the disaster that would spell for his ambitions to sell the club, he is willing to pay well to get that bounce that will see Villa above the dreaded dotted line come May.

Whether he feels this is Sherwood remains to be seen. Ideally, he would turn to a manager well-versed in steering sides clear of danger. But Tony Pulis has already pitched up in the midlands and is doing just fine at West Bromwich Albion.

Sherwood would be a gamble given his inexperience in these waters, but short-term at least, he may represent the best out there.

Long-term, Villa are in serious need of lasting change, they need to conduct a proper search of candidates, stage an in-depth recruitment policy.

Right now, though, there is not time for that. Right now, Sherwood is available.
