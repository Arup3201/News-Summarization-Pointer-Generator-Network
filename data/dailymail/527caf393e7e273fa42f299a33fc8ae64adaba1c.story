A chartered surveyor is set to spend two months inside an eight foot water tank in a desolate island as he tries to raise money for charity.

Nick Hancock is planning to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of Rockall and raise money for the Help for Heroes charity.

Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than Rockall itself.

Being in such an isolated location, only four people have ever slept on Rockall. Less than 100 have landed on it.

But Mr Hancock, 38, from Edinburgh, has even created a yellow living pod from an 8ft water tank, and made it cosy with spray-on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on Rockall.

He recently won Â£3500 from the Kukri Adventure Scholarship - following a presentation at the Royal Geographical Society in London - to help his bid, set for early June.

The current record for time spent on Rockall is 40 days back in 1985 - when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the islet.

Mr Hancock, who stayed for a short while on the isolated islet 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, hopes to spend a record-breaking 60 days on the rock to raise money for Help For Heroes.

'The RockPod survival shelter I have constructed is almost complete,' said Mr Hancock.

'It was recently insulated by Foamspray Technologies in Leeds, and I am now finishing it internally.

The majority of my equipment and supplies have arrived and I have been distributing and packing them in the plastic drums, donated by Smiths of Dean, which I will use to get my kit onto Rockall.

'I fully expect that I will have to repack several times to ensure I know where everything is, but otherwise I feel confident that I will be ready in a month's time for this amazing adventure.'

The expedition is being sponsored by Calor Gas who will provide a stove and the LPG needed to cook.

In 2011 TV adventurer Ben Fogle said he wanted to lead an exhibition to "reclaim" Rockall for Britain.

'I once tried to invade Rockall, unsuccessfully, and have first-hand experience of the ridiculousness of Rockall's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing. It is a realm of the sea, a kingdom governed only by the weather,' he said.

'Nick's attempt to not only land, but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity.'

Survival expert Bear Grylls added that it was 'an ambitious, exciting - and wonderfully mad - project, but in aid of a life-changing charity that needs our help.'

Even TV adventurer Ben Fogle failed to land Rockall and he has praised Mr Hancock for the attempt

Belgian radio enthusiasts landed on the remote North Atlantic islet - Britain's loneliest outpost - in October 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours.

The island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago.

The rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past Ireland, Iceland and Denmark have lain claim to Rockall and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it.

Ownership is now being examined by the United Nations in the light of competing claims from Iceland, the Faroes and Ireland.

The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810, by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion.

In 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on Rockall to reaffirm the UK's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition.

Andy Strangeway wanted to put a new plaque on Rockall to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the British Empire.

Yorkshireman Mr Strangeway also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach Rockall after there was a hold-up in getting the islet's first planning permission from the Western Isles Council - the nearest local authority.

The Royal Navy annexed Rockall in 1955 and the Island Of Rockall Act 1972 declared it part of the Western Isles.

Its exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831.

But it was on September 18, 1955, that the island was officially annexed by the British Crown when three marines - Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott, Sergeant Brian Peel and Corporal AA Fraser - and civilian naturalist James Fisher were deposited on the island by a Royal Navy helicopter.

Rockall is a formidable opponent for any adventurer, located 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and surrounded by choppy water

The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK's claim.

During his reconnaissance trip last June, Mr Hancock did unfurl a Union Jack and tweeted on Twitter: 'Happy jubilee Your Majesty' but did, however, lose some equipment during his brief stay.

The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11 feet x 4 feet, and is just 13 feet below the summit.

There are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae, seaweeds and one black lichen. Just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near Rockall.
