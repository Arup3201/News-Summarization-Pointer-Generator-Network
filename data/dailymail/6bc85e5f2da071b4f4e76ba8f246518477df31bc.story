Changes: More children now read more ebooks on iPads or Kindles than they do traditional books, which is damaging literacy standards (file picture)

Children who read on an iPad or Kindle are falling behind in the classroom as figures showed for the first time the majority of youngsters now prefer ebooks to printed versions.

The advance of technology means that young people who read on a screen have weaker literacy skills and fewer children now enjoy reading, experts have said.

A survey, conducted by The National Literacy Trust, found that 52 per cent of children preferred to read on an electronic device - including e-readers, computers and smartphones - while only 32 per cent said they would rather read a physical book.

Worryingly, only 12 per cent of those who read using new technology said they really
enjoyed reading, compared with 51 per cent of those who favoured books.

Pupils who get free school meals, generally a sign they are from poorer 
backgrounds, are the least likely group to pick up a traditional book, the research found.

The poll of 34,910 young people aged between eight and 16 
across the UK found that those who read printed texts were almost twice 
as likely to have above-average reading skills as those who read on 
screens every day.

The study also found that children were more likely to have their own computer than their own desk.

Jonathan Douglas, the director of the National Literacy Trust, said: 
'While we welcome the positive impact which technology has on bringing 
further reading opportunities to young people, it's crucial that reading
in print is not cast aside.

'We are concerned by our finding that children who only read 
on-screen are significantly less likely to enjoy reading and less likely
to be strong readers.

'Good reading skills and reading for pleasure are closely linked to 
children's success at school and beyond. We need to encourage children 
to become avid readers, whatever format they choose.'

Damaging: Reading electronically appears to be causing the number of children who enjoy reading to plummet as well as hinder academic performance, experts say

Award winning author Joan Brady is one of several literary stars to say the rise of the ebook is a 'problem' for Britain's children.

Boys in particular would prefer to read on a computer screen and the change in trend has encouraged many publishers to cash in by offering electronic versions of comics and books.

The number of children and young people reading newspapers has fallen from 46.8 per cent in 2005 to 31.2 per cent in 2012.
