It was a typically glamorous affair at today's Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Final at Cowdray Park Polo Club, Midhurst, England.

Fashion and music elite gathered at the champagne brand's VIP area, where waiters in orange aprons and orange sunglasses brandished glasses of bubbly.

Alexa Chung, Jodie Kidd, Tinie Tempah, Zafar Rushdie and Natalie Coyle all attended the event. Alexa led the fashion brigade in a gorgeous floral maxi dress, which she paired with simple black pumps and her trademark red lipstick.

Beauty icon, model and presenter Alexa recently said that her go-to lipstick was MAC's Lady Danger, which she appeared to be wearing today.

After arriving at the Polo she was pictured reclining on Veuve Clicquot's orange deckchairs, where she slipped off her shoes and beamed for cameras, seeming to be having the time of her life at the sporting event.

Jodie Kidd, meanwhile, arrived with her ex-solider fiance David Blakeley. He looked dapper in a blue shirt and chequered blazer, whilst Jodie sported an array of citrus tones, wearing a short orange dress and tangerine-coloured bag, with yellow sunglasses and matching yellow sandals.

She also bought two-year-old, Vianini, her son with ex-boyfriend and polo player Andrea Vianini. Jodie, 35, split from her partner and 
father of her child Andrea last summer after three years together, 
revealing the relationship had 'fizzled out' and they had found 
themselves spending lengthy spells apart.
