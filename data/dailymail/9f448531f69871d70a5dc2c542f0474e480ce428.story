The cruise ship entertainer who sent a young Gold Coast woman 1439 text messages in the weeks before she plummeted to her death allegedly emailed a former girlfriend a 34-point memo where he outlined the reasons 'why she is not worthy'.

Last month, Dan Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail for using a carriage service to menace and harass his cheerleader girlfriend Breeana Robinson, 21, before she plunged to her death in January 2013.

Former partner Kate Ostrowska, 35, has since revealed she allegedly received a lengthy email message from an account in Shearin’s name in 2010. It was just one of the 'nasty' alleged incidents that occurred during and after their tumultuous relationship. 

‘He sent me and my friend (an) email with a 34 point list,’ Ms Ostrowska told Daily Mail Australia.

The email featured the subject line 'Things for Kate to see a councilor (sic)' and branded Ms Ostrowska 'selfish, stubborn, nasty, psychotic'. 

It criticised her sexual performance and physical appearance and complained that she 'won't clean or cook'.

The note described her as 'jealous, two-faced, hates men', saying she 'always thinks she is the victim' and 'has no heart', among multiple other insults.  

Ms Ostrowska first met Shearin while working on a cruise ship in 2005.

The pair struck up a relationship over Facebook in 2010 and she soon came to Australia to meet with him.

'He was the perfect man for me,' she told Daily Mail Australia, saying the two talked together about love and their future life.

But when she came to Australia, Ms Ostrowska, from Poland, said their relationship quickly took a turn for the worst, with Shearin becoming ‘very controlling’ towards her.

‘I ALWAYS had to say sorry, and it was always my fault,’ Ms Ostrowska said. 

After their relationship ended, Ms Ostrowska said was receiving threatening Facebook messages from unknown people, who she believed was Shearin, until May 2014.

'You look disgusting,' said one message, seen by Daily Mail Australia as being sent from a woman's Facebook account.

On January 29, 2013, Shearin's girlfriend Breeana Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport, at 10.35pm.

She had just returned from cheerleading practice.

The athletic but slight young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building.

A court heard that in one text sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin wrote: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'.

In another text, Shearin wrote to Breanna: 'You're a complete f---ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c---'.

Shearin pleaded guilty to harassing Ms Robinson with his phone. According to reports, he is planning to appeal his six month sentence.

A former star of So You Think You Can Dance told Daily Mail Australia in October that Ms Robinson was a 'beautiful soul'.

Anthony Ikin, who runs a Gold Coast dance studio and has performed in Paris at the Moulin Rouge, said Ms Robinson - herself a talented dancer who was legally blind - was an inspiration to him. He called her his 'beautiful Bree'.

'I was just as big of a fan of hers as she was with me,' Mr Ikin told Daily Mail Australia from Los Angeles, where he is on tour.

'Her courage, strength and never-give-up attitude inspired me throughout my career. That time she came and watched me in Paris at the Moulin Rouge was magical.'
