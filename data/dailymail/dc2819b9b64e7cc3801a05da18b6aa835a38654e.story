England performed a spectacular U-turn on Friday night by sacking Alastair Cook as their one-day captain less than two months before the World Cup.

Only five days after they insisted that Cook would lead them in the showpiece one-day tournament, England dramatically changed their minds and ditched the man they have invested so much in over the last year.

Eoin Morgan will now lead England at the World Cup which starts in February and will be held in Australia and New Zealand.

Cook ultimately paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50-over form which has seen him average just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike-rate of 73 and lead England to five one-day defeats in their last six series.

Yet it still came as a shock when it emerged on Friday night that England were going to make a last-gasp change at the top because they have stuck with their man through thick and thin during a traumatic year for English cricket.

Last Sunday England coach Peter Moores, who has backed Cook emphatically since replacing Andy Flower in April, said ahead of England’s last one-day international in Sri Lanka: ‘If you ask my opinion, Cook will be captain at the World Cup.’

Then on Monday, just before England’s last defeat in their 5-2 series loss, managing director Paul Downton added: ‘I would be extremely surprised if he’s not captain at the World Cup.’

Now, with England leaving for a triangular series against Australia and India ahead of the World Cup in just over a fortnight, the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in Cook.

Moores met fellow selectors James Whitaker and Mick Newell at Loughborough on Friday, while Angus Fraser joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in Barbados and Downton sat in as a non-voting presence.

They ultimately reached their decision because of Cook’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven-match series in Sri Lanka even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him.

And the sense of England being in a state of one-day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace Cook with a batsman in Morgan who has a worse one-day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds.

At least Irishman Morgan, such a key performer in England’s one-day batting, seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one-day captain.

Cook, nothing if not a stubborn fighter, was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in Australian conditions.

He was under extreme pressure when England lost to India in the second Test at Lord’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three Tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one-day cricket. 

Cook, who has never played in a World Cup, leaves the post having led England to more one-day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one-day rankings in 2012 and the Champions Trophy final a year later.

It was the way Cook confounded his one-day doubters after succeeding Andrew Strauss in 2011 that convinced England he was still their man but they agonised over Cook’s future when he lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer.

They stood firm then but have lost their nerve now.

Now, as well as Morgan, the beneficiaries of Cook’s misfortune look sure to be Ian Bell, who will compete with Alex Hales to become Moeen Ali’s opening partner, and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was left out of the Sri Lankan squad.

England had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on Friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper Morgan in Sydney. Whitaker, the national selector, will confirm the World Cup squad at Lord’s that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it.

Bell, dropped after two matches in Sri Lanka, Ballance and the fit-again strike bowling pair of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will all form part of a 15-man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one-day tournament of all.

Cook, who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild England from the ashes of their 5-0 defeat by Australia, has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm.

The news may be a blow to Cook, but it should ensure that he is in better condition, both mentally and physically, at the start of a run of 17 Tests in little more than a year which begins when England tour the Caribbean in April.

A refreshed Cook will be integral to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes next summer which, whatever anyone in English cricket says, remains far more important than competing in a 50-over tournament.

England, who have not been World Cup contenders since 1992, have had to replace their one-day captains immediately after failed World Cup campaigns going back to Mike Atherton in 1996 and continuing with Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Strauss.

The only difference this time is that the axing has come before a World Cup failure rather than after one.
