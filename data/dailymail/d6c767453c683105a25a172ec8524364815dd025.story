American University is investigating an unofficial fraternity after emails between the brothers referencing rape, assault and drug abuse were leaked last week.

Epsilon Iota is not an official campus club, but the remnants of fraternity Alpha Tau Omega which was shut down in 2001 after several hazing and alcohol abuse incidents. The remaining brothers renamed themselves after their chapter name and have continued to recruit on campus.

Over 70 emails and text messages between the brothers, which date back to 2012, were posted on a Tumblr account last Thursday by an anonymous source.

Shocking: An unofficial fraternity at American University is drawing criticism after over 70 emails between brothers were leaked last week. Many of the emails make light of sexual abuse, like the one above

Some of the emails talk about using drugs like LSD and ADHD medication Adderall, but the most concerning exchanges reference rape.

In one email about organizing a mixer, one of the brothers writes that they should set up pre-games before hand where the girls will get drunk with the guys they know and are more comfortable with.

'Then [when] they start getting f***** up we switch them from apartments so they are f***** up when they meet brothers they know less and would hook up with easier,' the brother writes.

Unofficial institution: Epsilon Iota has at American University since 2001, formed when Alpha Tau Omega was shut down for hazing and alcohol abuse

Another email shows the brothers discussing how to best cover up a female's allegations that she was hit by a brother.

'Let's formulate an excuse. For the remainder of the semester, we feign ignorance - our brotherhood already met for the last time...None of us have heard anything except rumors from outside.'

Another brother offered a more horrifying response: 'It seems like damage control is very straightforward: someone needs to stuff a d*** in that [redacted] girl's mouth with the quickness.'

According to the Tumblr, the messages were posted in order 'to promote safety of AU students and speed up the disciplinary process for the individuals involved'.

AU President Neil Kerwin issued a statement saying the emails require 'immediate attention' because 'allegations include high risk and harmful behaviors that...may represent breaches of our student conduct code and of the law.'

Plotting: In one of the emails, a brother writes at length about how to best take advantage of drunk girls

Serious allegation: While discussing which girl should be named the fraternity's 'sweetheart', one of the brothers speaks about a girl whose friend was allegedly raped at the fraternity

'That these alleged behaviors may have occurred within our community reminds us that we are not immune from the problems that have occurred on campuses across the country,' President Kerwin wrote. 'This situation cannot be viewed as an isolated set of circumstances.'

And this isn't the first time the university has tried to shut the frat down.

In 2006 they threatened to disband EI, saying it posed threats to the community because 'it does not follow any sort of bylaws and engages in questionable behavior such as hazing and excessive drinking'.

However, it's hard to target an unofficial society and the group continued to prosper - much to the dismay of residents near the Washington, DC campus.

In a single year, the fraternity was responsible for 15 neighborhood complaints including 'loud parties, public urination and trash.'

But they may not be so lucky this time. In addition to criticism from the school administration, a Change.org petition to shut the group down has garnered over 1,000 signatures.Â
