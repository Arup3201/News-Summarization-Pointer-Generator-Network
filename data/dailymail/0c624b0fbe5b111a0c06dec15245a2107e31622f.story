Dozens of objects recovered from the ruins of Roman cities Pompeii and Herculaneum will go on show outside Italy for the first time at a new exhibition at the British Museum.

The two cities on the Bay of Naples were wiped out by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

The show will feature objects found in their ruins including jewellery, carbonised food and a baby’s crib that still rocks on its curved runners.

An employee of the British Museum holds a colourful fragment of wall painting unearthed from the destroyed Roman city of Pompeii, which is set to go on display outside Italy for the first time.

Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, in AD 79.

Just after midday on August 24, 
fragments of ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris began pouring down 
on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and
causing the roofs of many houses to fall in.

Curator Paul Roberts said the 250 objects would illustrate the domestic lives of the population and show the 'different halves of this amazing story'.

He said: 'These are not extraordinary cities, they die in an extraordinary way, but they are ordinary cities in Roman terms.

'That’s why they are so important because we can look at them and say we have a pretty good idea what was going on in other Roman cities.'

Mr Roberts said the 400 to 500 centigrade volcanic avalanche that buried Herculaneum had preserved many objects including furniture and food.

He said: 'It was buried in a different way from Pompeii and the effect of that as this cloud of superheated gas and debris swirled around the houses of Herculaneum it carbonised, it turned into charcoal wood, leather and even food.'

Six pieces of carbonised furniture, including the crib, will be lent to the British Museum in what Mr Roberts said was 'a world first'.

He said there would also be “a loaf of bread that was put in the oven in AD79 and came out in the 1930s” complete with the namestamp of the slave who baked it.

Other exhibits include peppercorns rescued from the drains, carbonised figs, a lamp and wall paintings.

Also on show will be the body casts 
of six people, including a family of two adults and two children who 
died huddled together under the steps of their villa, and a pet dog.

Mr Roberts said: 'The exhibition 
isn’t about death, you had to have the death of the cities in order to 
bring them to life again, but the exhibition is all about the life of 
these people.

'Domestic life is something we all share.

'We don’t all go to the baths, we don’t all go to the amphitheater - but we all have a home,' he said. 

The exhibition, which is sponsored by
Goldman Sachs, is a collaboration with the Archaeological 
Superintendency of Naples and Pompeii, which is responsible for the 
remains of the two cities.
