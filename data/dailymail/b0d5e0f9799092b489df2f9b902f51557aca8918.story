An Ohio police officer and his wife were arrested for leaving their young children alone in the car with a loaded gun while they went to a bar to drink.

Michael Webb, 35 and his wife Staci Hall, 29, who were on vacation with their 11-month old and 3-year old boys in Florida, are charged with aggravated child neglect.

The children were found asleep in the backseat of the car by the bar's staff who called the police.

When officers appeared on scene they discovered Webb's .40-cailber Glock pistol in the vehicle, loaded and easily within reach of the children, The News Herald of Panama City reported.

The gun was discovered out in the open, unholstered on the driver's side door.

After the arresting officers found the unattended infant and toddler in the car with the window slightly cracked they proceeded in to The Coyote Ugly Saloon.

There they discovered the 
couple drinking at the bar, 'with no apparent view of their children,' 
The News Herald reported. 

The couple had reportedly been sitting at the bar for close to an hour by the time the police arrived.

Webb is a police officer with the Ross Township Police Department of Ohio.

Currently facing charges in Florida, he has been placed on administrative leave at home as a result of his arrest, Ross Township Police Chief Ben Kramer told Cincinnati.com.

Webb and Hall were detained at the Bay County Jail and released after posting separate $500 bail bonds. 

Their children were taken into custody by the Florida Department of Children and Family Services.
