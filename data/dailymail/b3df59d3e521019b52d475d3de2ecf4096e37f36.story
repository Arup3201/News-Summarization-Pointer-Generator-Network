Singletons in search of love should take note - 8.52pm tonight will be the best time this year to find a date online.

Researchers believe people looking for a date will have the best chance of finding someone compatible shortly before 9pm as the number of people logging on to internet dating sites peaks.

They believe a combination of back to work blues and New Year's resolutions to find a partner will send millions of people to online dating sites.

Researchers say the numbers of people logging on to internet dating sites will peak at 8.52pm

It will conclude what is traditionally the busiest week of the year for online dating.

On match.com alone, interactions between members over the past seven days were 11 per cent higher than average.

In January, an estimated 3.2million people will go online in search of a date.

Kate Taylor, resident relationship 
expert at match.com, said: 'It's the time of year when we vow to eat 
more healthily, exercise more frequently and budget better.

'As
the Christmas festivities calm down and we re-evaluate our lives, it's 
little wonder that looking for a partner will top the list of New Year 
priorities for many single people.

Match.com said people are happier in a relationship and many singletons will have made it a New Year's resolution to find a partner

'If you make sure you're online during the busiest time of the 
whole year you'll have an even better chance of meeting someone 
special.'

Match.com found that financial security, work performance, family relationships and body confidence improved when people are in a relationship.

Internet dating is now the third most popular way to meet a partner in Britain, along with meeting someone at work.

It has become so central that it is now included in the Office for National Statistic's UK 'shopping basket' of goods and services that measures the UK's cost of living.
