This sorry sight is the result of mindless vandalism which police are calling a 'crime against our Armed Forces'.

The First World War memorial was knocked over on Friday night, leaving lumps of stone scattered across the grass where people would normally stand to pay their respects.

Villagers in Prestbury, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where the structure has stood proudly since 1920, have placed a £1,000 bounty on the heads of those responsible.

No respect: The shattered remains of the First World War memorial in Prestbury, Gloucestershire, lay strewn across the grass. The monument carries the names of 41 dead servicemen on six plaques

They are now desperately trying to raise funds to get the structure repaired in time for Remembrance Sunday on November 13.

Sergeant Mark Stephens, from Gloucestershire Constabulary, said the cost of the damage could be as much as £5,000.

He said: 'This is a crime against the men and women of our Armed Forces who have in the past, and continue in the present day, to pay the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country to ensure the freedom and liberty we all enjoy.

'This will have a significant impact on not only the residents of Prestbury, but also the wider Cheltenham community.

'It is particularly poignant as we are so close to Remembrance Sunday when a great many people attend the Prestbury service held at the memorial to honour those who have fallen in service of our country.

'You can rest assured that I will ensure every possible line of inquiry is fully investigated to determine how this damage occurred and, if it were malicious, to bring those responsible before the courts.'

Manhunt: Police gather evidence from the scene. They want to speak to three people seen taking photographs of the memorial around 30 minutes before the vandalism was reported

The memorial carries the names of 41 servicemen killed in the 1914-18 war on six plaques.

It was built in April 1920 using donations from villagers in place of a tree used as a gift-giving spot for children.

Outraged businessman Terry Croft, 44, has put up a £1,000 reward to catch the vandals.

Mr Croft, from Prestbury, said: 'I think I know the sort of person who would have done something as shocking as this and for the circles in which they operate, this sort of offer should have some impact.

'Money always talks and if it brings somebody forward who has information to help catch whoever did this, it will be well spent.'

A dog walker reported 
seeing a woman and two men taking pictures of the memorial - dedicated 
to the parish's war dead - shortly before it was destroyed.

Police want to speak to three white people, aged 18 to 25, in connection with the incident.

They
were between 5ft 6in and 5ft 9in tall, dressed in jeans and anoraks, at
about 11.20pm - 30 minutes before the vandalism was reported.

It is not known whether the memorial can be repaired or replaced for Armistice Day.

Poignant: The vandalism comes just weeks before the village marks Remembrance Day in honour of those who have died in conflicts since the First World War

Prestbury Parish Council will debate the matter at a meeting tonight.

Malcolm Stennett, parish council chairman, said: 'It's really horrendous.

'It's terrible when you think that our troops are out fighting at the moment, getting killed and injured, and people are going around desecrating a war memorial.

'It must show an extremely low intellect and I hope the police are able to bring the culprits to book.'

The Reverend Daniel Papworth, of north Cheltenham team ministry, added: 'It is sad and distressing to see the damage and local people are understandably shocked.'
