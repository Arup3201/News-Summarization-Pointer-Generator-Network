Inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt has marked a new milestone in her recovery after another harrowing health scare where her family feared the worst. 

In recent weeks, surgeons successfully constructed a new nose for the 27-year-old bushfire survivor. 

But her family were on edge throughout the entire procedure, with Ms Pitt telling Woman's Day she stopped breathing during the operation.

Before: Ms Pitt spent more than two years in hospital, much of it wearing a compression stocking (left) after experiencing burns to around 65 per cent of the body. Her face is pictured right prior to the reconstructive surgery on her nose performed recently

Burns victim: Ms Pitt experienced burns to around 70 per cent of her body during the 2011 bushfire. After years of recovery, Ms Pitt told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long!"

Prior to the bushfire, Ms Pitt, from Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast, worked as a mining engineer and a model

Her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone'.

'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine.

'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' 

It has been a long road to recovery for Ms Pitt, who suffered burns to around 65 per cent of her body when she was caught in a bushfire in the Kimberley in September 2011. 

Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. 

But she was not expecting complications in this latest procedure. Ms Pitt told the magazine: 'I thought I'd wake up in the burns unit, but instead I woke up in ICU.' 

Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is now happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media. 

Milestone woman: Ms Pitt published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For

Soul mates: Turia Pitt's boyfriend, Michael Hoskin, has been by her side since the very beginning of her hospital experience

Up and at it: Ms Pitt agreed to an out-of-court settlement with ultra-marathon event organisers Racing The Planet in 2014.

She told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'. 

It's just the latest in a series of milestones for Ms Pitt, who last year published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For.

She starred on the front cover of magazine The Australian Women's Weekly in June 2014. The cover won praise for featuring Ms Pitt.

Ms Pitt has headlined a number of a speaking opportunities and in June 2014 she trekked the Great Wall of China to raise more than $175,000AUD for the charityInterplast. 

Interplast sends teams of volunteer medical workers to developing countries in Asia to provide free surgery for people suffering conditions including cleft lip and palate and burn scar contractures.   

Ms Pitt told Woman's Day she is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman next year, following an operation to 'refine her nose and widen her nostrils'. 

Ms Pitt and Mr Hoskin currently live in Ulladulla, on the south coast of New South Wales.
