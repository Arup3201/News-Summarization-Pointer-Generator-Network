A second body has been found at the site of a house fire in Filleigh.

Fire destroyed a couple's Grade II listed home on an estate owned by the Earl and Countess of Arran.

Bob Rines, who rented the gatehouse of the Arran family seat, died in the fire which ripped through the property he shared with his wife Joan on the Castle Hill Estate, in Devon.

Fire probe: Two firefighters investigate the damage at Meadow Park Lodge after a man was killed. A second person is feared to still be inside the property

Tragedy: The burnt out Meadow Park Lodge property on the Castle Hill Estate where the fire happened in the early hours. Two bodies have now been found

A police spokesman said: ‘One body was found and recovered after a very careful search this morning.

‘A second body has just been located in the property in the last five minutes.

‘Police priorities now lie in identifying the deceased and informing the next of kin.’

The couple, aged in their 60s, had lived in the property for the last seven years.

The Countess of Arran, Eleanor Gore, said it was a 'hideous thing' to have 'happened to such lovely people'.

The countess, who was Eleanor van Cutsem before she married, and her husband Arthur Gore, the 9th Earl of Arran, let out 50 properties on the 5,000-acre Devon estate.

Lady Arran's family, the Fortescues, have lived in Devon since 1454 and she is the 16th generation to live on the site after her ancestors arrived in England with William the Conqueror in 1066.

Her husband Lord Arran is one of the 92 surviving hereditary peers in the House of Lords and the couple have two children.

Their daughter Laura married Major James Duckworth-Chad, MVO, former Equerry to The Queen, in 2004.

Mr Rines worked for South West Water and today his van was still parked outside the property he had lived in with his wife since 2005.

The police and fire service are carrying out a joint investigation into the cause of the blaze.

Possible double death: Bob Rines died in the blaze and his wife Joan is also feared to have been killed

Probe: An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way. Firefighters entered the property this afternoon and found a second body

The
site, set in countryside near Barnstaple, Devon, employs around 30 
staff is frequently used for weddings and corporate events.

The main house there burned down in 1934 when two people lost their lives.

A
cordon was moved back along the driveway of the estate as fire crews 
went into the burned out lodge to search for the second body they expect
to find inside the gutted building.

Tragedy on their land: The Earl and Countess of Arran own the estate which has approximately 50 houses on it

Joan Rines was described as older than her husband and has five grown-up children who have long since moved away.

Lady Arran said: 'We're just completely devastated. That such a hideous thing has happened to such lovely people.

'I looked out of the bedroom window and all I could see was flames licking in to the sky. So we rushed down there.

'There was not much we could do except pray. I've been to see some of the family today - our hearts go out to them.'

Paul Smalley, the Castle Hill house estate manager. paid tribute to the couple. Although only one body has been found, residents and staff are braced for more bad news.

'We are all in shock. They were very well known and very well respected residents on the estate,' he said.

'They have lived in the house since 2005. Their house is at the end of the front drive and all of us would see them as we drove in and out.

Country residence: Castle Hill House at Filleigh, Devon, which is primarily used for weddings. A property on the estate was gutted by fire in the early hours of today

'They were friendly figures - always giving a wave and a smile and sharing normal chit chat.

'We will all miss them terribly and our thoughts are with the five children of Joan Rines.

'Robert, or Bob, as he was known worked for South West Water. There was nothing to suggest they wouldn't be living with us in this close-knit community for many more years.'

Crews were called out to the large fire at Meadow Park Lodge at around 2.30am this morning.

Earlier a spokesman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was to be investigated.

'One person was found dead and a joint investigation will be carried out with the police,' he said.

'The building is in quite an unstable 
state so it has not been possible to go inside and there are still 
persons unaccounted for.'
