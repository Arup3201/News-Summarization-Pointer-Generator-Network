Software king-turned-fugitive John McAfee has a penchant for big bottoms and snorting 'bath salts' through a straw in his underpants.

That's according to a bizarre new video the millionaire has posted on his blog, where he plays the part not of Silicon Valley tech genius but a Hugh Hefner-esque hero in his playboy bunny element.

Titled, 'The McAfee Guide to Uninstalling McAfee Antivirus,' the eccentric 4:26 minute clip shows the 67-year-old, who last year was on the run from police over a murder in Central America, slamming the software empire he founded in various states of undress.

He starts out reading a selection of the 'volumes' of letters he claims to still receive, despite selling the business 15 years ago, asking how to uninstall the software. One of which colorfully bemoans how the software inhibits his pornography downloading.

'I have no idea,' he declares in a red silk robe before he sets a bill on fire to light a cigarette.

McAfee then asks a geeky glasses-wearing fellow to explain to viewers how to rid themselves of the software he's in the past called 'too annoying' to use.

Bath salts: The eccentric millionaire is undresses by his harem

Meanwhile, the millionaire busies himself with a group of big busted, big bootied women.

When the lab tech 'Bartholomew' talks about 'backing up,' McAfee gropes the sizable bottom of one of his 'bunnies' pulling her rear towards his lap as others touch, stroke and kiss him.

Using an elaborate straw, he then inhales a mountain of white powder labelled 'bath salts' before sucking the tow of one of his ladies.

Then he gets to business, lambasting the software company he created in the 1980s, which is now owned by Intel.

Toe-sucking: McAfee indulges in some toe-sucking in the odd video that he uploaded to his blog on Wednesday

'Fifteen years ago, I had some beautiful software and they took it over. I don't know what they did,' he explains.

'It was like the time I hired that Bangkok prostitute to do my taxes while I f***ed my accountant. It was just like that.'

McAfee then takes the uninstalling of the software into his own hands.

'I know what to do, I know exactly what to do,' he says, before grabbing a hand gun and shooting at his laptop screen.
