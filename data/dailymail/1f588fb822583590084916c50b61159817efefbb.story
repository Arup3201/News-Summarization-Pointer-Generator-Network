David Cameron called in under-fire Andrew Mitchell  for a face-to-face meeting after news broke that he had called police ‘plebs’ during his foul-mouthed Downing Street rant, it emerged tonight.

The Prime Minister told Mr Mitchell his behaviour was unacceptable, and the Government chief whip  said that he did not use the words attributed to him in reports but accepted he needed to apologise.

He 'looked him in the eye', insisting he didn't use the word, sources said. Mr Cameron has since read an official police log showing he called officers 'f****** plebs', but is expected to stand by Mr Mitchell.

Beleaguered: Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative Party Chief Whip speaks to the media outside the Cabinet office in Whitehall, central London, yesterday to address allegations he hurled abuse at a police officer

Boris Johnson today claimed it would 
have been 'common sensical' for police to have arrested Mr Mitchell for 
his outburst, which the police log says left members of the public ‘visibly shocked’.

But
to further undermine Mr Mitchell’s explanation for his rant, it also 
emerged today that the ‘long and extremely frustrating day’ which he 
blamed for his foul-mouthed tirade at police officers included lunch at 
London’s poshest curry house, the Cinnamon Club.

The full police log for the confrontation reveals details of the moment 
Mr Mitchell was told by officers to use a side gate to leave Downing 
Street, and not the main gates reserved for ministerial cars.

Mr Mitchell repeatedly stated that he was the chief whip and demanded the main gates be opened, the log says.

After several refusals he eventually made his way to the side gate, where he let rip at officers.

The police log states: ‘There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite 
the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr Mitchell said: “Best you 
learn your f****** place... you don't run this f****** Government... 
You're ******* plebs.”

‘The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken 
aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior Government
official. I cannot say if this statement was aimed at me individually, 
or the officers present or the police service as a whole.’

In a hugely embarrassing escalation of the stand-off, officers then 
threatened Mr Mitchell with arrest under the Public Order Act for 
swearing, a move backed by Mr Johnson.

London Mayor Boris Johnson used a visit to South Ruislip Library to say police should have arrested Andrew Mitchell

The London Mayor said today: 'In my book you shouldn’t abuse police officers and I’ve made that clear loads of times.

'If I read the papers correctly there was a proposal to arrest Mr Mitchell for what he said. That seems to be wholly common-sensical.

'The public order act does allow for police officers’ discretion in this matter. They’ve obviously decided not to go ahead with it. But it shows the gravity of this offence.'

A YouGov poll found more than two-thirds of voters accepted the police account that Mr Mitchell called officers 'plebs' after they refused to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street.

More than half the 1,739 adults questioned in the online survey - 52 per cent - said they thought he should resign.

Earlier today one of Mr Mitchell's daughters told reporters outside the family home: 'I can tell you one thing - my father is an honest man.'

The official police log of what Andrew Mitchell said to officers in Downing Street

Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary, today condemned the outburst. 'Andrew Mitchell has apologised for what he did. It was clearly totally wrong for anyone to go around swearing at police officers but certainly for Cabinet ministers.

'He has apologised for that, I gather he has apologised directly to the police. I think we should draw a line under the matter now."

However the full police log, reported by the Daily Telegraph, will dash any hopes 
among senior government figures of drawing a line under the row.

Mr Mitchell has pointedly refused to deny using the word ‘pleb’ – a politically 
damaging remark which reinforces the impression of an out of touch Tory 
elite.

But the contemporaneous note from an on-duty police officer makes for devastating reading.

To make matters worse, it also emerged that Mr Mitchell had spent part of the day at one of Westminster's smartest restaurants.

Andrew Mitchell's 'long and incredibly frustrating day' included lunch at the Cinnamon Club in Great Smith Street, London which is within walking distance of several government departments

Famed for its upmarket Indian cuisine, the Cinnamon Club menu includes fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried morels and saffron sauce, costing £95

Mr Mitchell has in part blamed a 'long and frustrating day' for losing his temper, but The Sun newspaper today claims he spent part of that day enjoying lunch at the Cinnamon Club where main courses start at around £20, but the fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried morels and saffron sauce costs £95.

Ex-government adviser George McGregor told The Sun he was dining at the restaurant at the time near Mr Mitchell, and said: 'He didn't seem to be having a long and frustrating day to me.'

It is thought he was there for around an hour and a half.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Mitchell had eaten at the curry house, but stressed: ‘It was a lunch, not a long lunch.’

Mr Mitchell yesterday broke his silence with an apology outside the Cabinet Office.

There was speculation he might be on the verge of saying something dramatic, or even offering his resignation.

But, in the event, a clearly 
uncomfortable Mr Mitchell denied using the ‘words that have been 
attributed to me’ – but refused to say exactly what he had told the 
police.

This stubborn reluctance to discuss 
the precise language last Wednesday evening meant he was bombarded with 
fresh questions.

Claims: Mr Mitchell denied using the words attributed to him, but pointedly refused to deny he had using the classist slur 'pleb' against the officers

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood 
last night rejected Labour’s call for a full inquiry into the incident, 
and attempted to close down the affair.

In a letter to shadow home secretary 
Yvette Cooper, Sir Jeremy said Mr Cameron had spoken to Mr Mitchell and 
‘made very clear that his behaviour fell short of what he expects of his
ministers’.

Sir Jeremy said there was a ‘genuine difference of view’ 
about what Mr Mitchell had said.

He said he had discussed the incident 
with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who was also 
‘very disappointed at the lack of respect shown towards the police’.

But
he said Mr Hogan-Howe did not wish to pursue the matter as the officers
concerned had accepted Mr Mitchell’s apology.

The Met however faced a backlash when 
it emerged it was launching a leak inquiry to find out how details of 
the clash were passed to the media.

Downing Street backed the Chief Whip, saying Mr Cameron accepted his version of events and believed it was time to ‘move on’.

But their stance infuriated the 
police, who said their officers were effectively being accused of lying.
John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called on 
Mr Cameron to hold an investigation.

‘Clearly Mr Mitchell is denying using certain words, effectively now impugning the integrity of the police officers,’ he said.

Two-wheeled terror: Mr Mitchell had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike into Downing Street when he made the outburst at police

Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, today demanded the truth about the incident from the Mr Cameron.

She told ITV's Daybreak: 'You read these reports and you have got a cabinet minister not just swearing at the police but also sneering at them, calling them plebs, saying they should know their place.

'I don't think the prime minister can just dismiss this and try and sweep this under the carpet.'

Yesterday Mr Mitchell acknowledged 
that he had not shown the police ‘the amount of respect I should have 
done’ but said the incident had come at ‘the end of a long and extremely
frustrating day’.

One senior Tory said colleagues had 
been ‘surprised’ by Mr Mitchell’s grudging statement, adding: ‘We 
expected him to be far more contrite.’

Shortly after his tirade at the 
police, the minister headed off to dine at the Carlton Club, a private 
club for Conservative members in the exclusive St James’ area of London,
where he was guest speaker.

Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick 
Clegg said it was ‘really important that Andrew Mitchell explains fully 
and in detail his version of events’.

And Jeremy Browne, the Lib Dem Home Office minister, said the apology left unanswered questions.

He added: 'I think people want to know what was said. Explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said, so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up.'

Friends of Mr Mitchell last night said
he was ‘categoric’ that he had not used the  word pleb. One ally 
claimed officers may have misheard him say the word ‘plod’.

Last night it was suggested that the 
firearms officers at the centre of the row face being moved from Downing
Street when they return to duty today to keep them out of the 
spotlight.
