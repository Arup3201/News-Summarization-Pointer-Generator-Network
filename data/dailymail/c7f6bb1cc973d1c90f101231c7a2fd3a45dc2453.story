A creative mother has begun a 'rescue' project in which she refashions sexualised children's dolls into a more natural and childlike form.

Sonia Singh, from Hobart in Tasmania, removes any trace of make-up, reduces the lip and eye size and personally sews the dolls modest new outfits.

Her before and after pictures of the refurbished dolls reveals a stark difference between the out-of-proportion Barbie dolls and make-up clad Bratz dolls, and her more natural alternative.

Hobart woman Sonia Singh has begun re-furbishing pre-owned Bratz dolls into a more natural form

'This little ex-Bratz girl has had a major make-under! I Rescued from the Glenorchy tip shop in Tasmania, she has been repainted, and restyled and refooted,' the mother-of-one wrote on her website 

Ms Singh also began sharing before and after photos of the doll to show their dramatic transformation 

'Here are the Tree Change Dolls (ex-Bratz dolls) playing outside the way kids should, after their radical make-unders,' Ms Singh wrote on her website, Tree Change Dolls.

'These dolls have been rescued and rehabilitated from op-shops and tip shops around Tasmania.

'These lil [sic] fashion dolls have opted for a 'tree change', swapping high-maintenance glitz 'n' glamour for down-to-earth style.

'I hand repaint the dolls faces, mould new shoes, and my Mum sews and knits their clothing.'

She has received an overwhelming amount of support for the project which she's called Tree Change Dolls

The creative mother plans to sell the toys online on Etsy after being bombarded with requests from enthusiastic parents

Ms Singh's creations result in a doll that any child can relate to and she matches their new looks by photographing them doing exactly what children enjoy

The result is something that any little girl can relate to and their creator matches their new looks by photographing them doing exactly what children enjoy – climbing trees, swinging on tyres and romping around outside. 

MGA Entertainment's Bratz website describes their dolls as 'the only girls with a passion for fashion' who are all about 'the hottest fashion trendz' and 'serious attitude'.

Ms Singh explained that the inspiration for her modified dolls came from something a little more humble.

The contrast greatly with MGA Entertainment's Bratz dolls which are described as 'the only girls with a passion for fashion' who are all about 'the hottest fashion trendz' and 'serious attitude'

'I found this ex-Bratz doll at the Margate tip shop in Tassie,' Ms Singh wrote, 'She was definitely ready for a tree change! I have re-painted her face, sewn overalls, moulded new shoes, and re-conditioned her hair. Her top is hand knitted by my Mum!'

'My sisters and I grew up playing with second-hand dolls and home-made toys in the beautiful Tasmanian natural environment,' she wrote.

'I love the satisfaction of repairing and reusing discarded items to give them a new lease on life.'

Since sharing images from her project online, Ms Singh has received an overwhelming amount of support from parents requesting to purchase the toys.

She now plans to set up an online store on Etsy where she'll sell the second-hand dolls to loving homes, complete with a before picture.
