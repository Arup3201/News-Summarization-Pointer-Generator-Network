Russia is accusing Kiev of using white phosphorous in bombings of Ukrainian cities controlled by rebel separatists.

The city of Slavyansk came under fire overnight on Thursday and residents told Russian media that incendiary bombs were dropped on the city.

A video allegedly showing the overnight attack by Kiev military sees white flames rain down from the sky.

Potential proof: This video was released by  Russian media earlier this month, and allegedly shows white phosphorous bombs being dropped on a Ukranian city

Slavyansk is a separatist stronghold in southeastern Ukraine which has been the focal point of the government’s terrorist crackdown over the past months.

Although Kiev and groups of pro-Russian rebels have exchanged fire in and around the city since the end of April, Kiev firmly denies any use of banned weapons and incendiary bombs.

Ukraine’s National Guard, a part-volunteer force heavily involved in the eastern campaign, dismissed the incendiary bomb charges as absurd.

The video allegedly filmed in Slavyansk during the bombing began circulating in Russian media on Thursday and witnesses say they came under fire from both rockets and bombs.

‘We all saw what happened here yesterday. They used rocket launchers as well as incendiary bombs against us,’ resident Roman Litvinov told Russia Today.

White light: According to witnesses of the shelling on June 12, the bombs dropped were incendiary phosphorous bombs, a type of weapon which is banned by the UN, something  firmly denied by Kiev

‘The ground was on fire. How can the ground burn by itself. It burned for about forty minutes,' he added.

‘Ukrainian defence forces and nationalists are using prohibited weapons against Slavyansk civilians, firing on refugees and killing children,’ said Russia’s human rights ombudsman Konstantin Dolgov yesterday.

‘Kiev’s humanitarian crimes against its residents in the south-east are multiplying. They must be investigated and the guilty punished.’

Incendiary devices are designed to set off fires and were used widely during the Vietnam war. They are banned by the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.

Russia was accused of sending tanks into Ukraine today with Kiev claiming three T-72 tanks entered the country in Snizhne - some 13 miles inside Ukraine. It comes as attention was diverted to chaos in Iraq

Video footage appeared to show  tanks moving towards Horlivka - a mining city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly claimed it would not invade Ukraine, having annexed the Crimean peninsula

Success: The Ukraine army managed to re-take several Pro-Russian separatist control points in the region of Mariupol on Friday

Battle: Destroyed barricades in an unidentified part of Mariupol on Friday

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov
 warned that Ukraine has failed to make any progress in efforts to stop 
the violence and halt military operations, adding: ‘This is causing 
increasing concern.'

This 
comes after Thursday's accusations from Kiev that Russia us sending 
tanks into Ukraine for the first time while the West’s attention was 
diverted by the chaos in Iraq.

The
 development threatens to destroy the tentative peace process just when 
the US and EU had hoped Vladimir Putin had agreed to ease tension.

Three
 T-72 tanks were in Snizhne, some 13 miles inside Ukraine, backed up by 
armoured personnel carriers, claimed Kiev. It was initially not clear if
 the tanks were Russian or under  the control of separatist forces 
sympathetic  to Moscow.

Russia uses T-72 tanks but Ukraine does not.
