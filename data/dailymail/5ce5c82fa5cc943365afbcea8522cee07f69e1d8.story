French club Bordeaux-Begles have announced the signing of Australia star Adam Ashley-Cooper.

Ashley-Cooper, 30, has agreed a two-year deal and will move to France after next year's World Cup, Bordeaux announced on their official website.

The Wallabies centre or wing has won 104 caps and is set to be a key performer when Australia tackle a World Cup pool next autumn that also includes England and Wales.

'I am extremely grateful for my career in Australia, and I want to thank the ARU (Australian Rugby Union) and the Waratahs for their support over the past decade,' Ashley-Cooper said.

'Without them, it would have been impossible for me to write this new chapter.

'I look forward to participating in the future of the (Bordeaux) club after the World Cup.'
