Nearly 800 people have had surgical instruments left inside them after having an invasive procedure at a hospital since 2005, according to a new report.

The report from The Joint Commission, a non-profit health care safety watchdog, shows there were 772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012, resulting in 16 deaths.

Equipment like sponges, towels, needles,
 instruments, retractors and other small items and fragments of tools 
have been found in patients.

The researchers found the most common causes of these incidents were due to human error and a lack of policies and procedures.

The report notes that doctors traditionally rely on protocols like counting all of their tools or conducting ‘cavity sweeps’ to look for equipment.

About 80 per cent of retained sponges occur when the nurses and doctors think they've had a correct count.

In 95 per cent of the cases, patients had to stay longer in the hospital, according to CBS News.

The most common sites these incidents occurred were operating rooms, labour and delivery rooms, ambulatory surgery centres or labs where invasive procedures such as catheters or colonoscopies take place.

An incident was nine times more likely when an operation was performed in an emergency basis and four times more likely when the procedure changed unexpectedly.

Sophia Savage, a nurse from Kentucky is one of those unlucky people to have experienced this first hand.

She became violently ill in 2005, only to undergo a CT scan and find out a surgical sponge had been left in her abdomen during a hysterectomy four years earlier. 

‘What they found was horrific,’ Savage told the New York Times in 2012. ‘It had adhered to the bladder and the stomach area, and to the walls of my abdominal cavity.’

She added, ‘I never dreamed something like this would happen to me.’

The Commission says she suffered severe health issues, anxiety, depression and disability.

Savage sued the hospital where the surgery took place for $2.5 million, but the award was appealed.

'Open communication': Ana Pujols-McKee, executive vice president and chief medical officer at The Joint Commission, who did the report. She says it is critical that hospitals comply with procedures

The watchdog is now calling for a stricter, more standardised counting system involving all members of the hospital team, including surgeons, nurses, techs, anesthesiologists, and radiologists.

They recommend two people - a nurse and tech - count out all the equipment and have it verified by a surgeon.

The counts should be performing them before the surgery begins, before the cavity is closed and at the time the procedure ends.

A whiteboard can display the count, and the team should debrief to address any concerns about equipment or the procedure.

Such a system was shown to reduce errors at one children's hospital by 50 per cent in only one year.

‘It's
 critical to establish and comply with policies and procedures to make 
sure all surgical items are identified and accounted for, as well to 
ensure that there is open communication by all members of the surgical 
team about any concerns,’ said Dr Ana Pujols McKee, chief medical 
officer of The Joint Commission in a statement on their website.
