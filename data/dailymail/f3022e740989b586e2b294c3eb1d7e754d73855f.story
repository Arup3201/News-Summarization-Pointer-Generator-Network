A California family are in mourning after the sudden death of an Oakland tech-engineer who collapsed riding his skateboard on Tuesday - just three weeks before the expected birth of his first child.

According to witnesses, George Schnakenberg, 38, came off his board with no warning. He was then taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

His pregnant wife, Joanne Chang called her husband 'the light of my life' and revealed that the couple are expecting a girl and that they are to name her Nova.

Distraught, Chang told the San Francisco Chronicle that she felt 'lucky to have had' George in her life.

'His energy was infectious, his creativity was unbounded. George had more ideas than he had time to develop them all.'

Several witnesses reported to investigators that Schnakenberg fell while riding and may have hit a parked car afterward.

Hailing from Pittsburgh, Schnakenberg was the co-founder and design director of Sollega Inc., which produces solar equipment and solutions for large firms.

Relaxed: Joanne wrote that she will desperately miss her husband and that he had too many ideas in his head to act on

He worked in the design industry for almost 20-years and made products for a wide range of clients, such Nike and TiVo.

His wife said that the greatest tragedy is that he will never see his daughter.

'I still cannot comprehend that the invention he was most proud of - his daughter - is one he will not get to see,' she said.

In his spare time, Schnakenberg also worked at the Oakland consultancy, Infinite Collective, where he created several products, including an electric skateboard and bike.

'He was just very upbeat, positive, innovative, creative ... a hard worker, really smart, a great designer and just a very good person and good friend,' said Chang to the San Francisco Chronicle.

His friends joined Chang in lamenting the tragic passing of the talented designer.

'He's somebody who knows everybody and is loved by a lot of people, and one of the best designers I've ever met,' said John Humphrey, 41, a close friend who lives in New York.

His friends and family have set up a memorial page that has already raised $36,000, which will be set aside for his unborn daughter, Nova.

'When we close our eyes,' the family wrote, 'we picture George on his skateboard descending an endless hill, with San Francisco behind him, and his trademark big grin.'
