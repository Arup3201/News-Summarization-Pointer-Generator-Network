Basketball star Kendrick Perkins shocked his 55,000 Twitter followers on Tuesday night when he offered them the chance to buy his pet dog.

The center for the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder tweeted just before 10:30pm: ‘Hey I have a English bulldog and he to big to be around my youngest child he 10 months got his papers and he got a micro chip.’

Perkins sent another tweet a minute later explaining that even though he had paid $3,000 for the dog he was willing to accept $1,500. ‘Just want him to have a good family’ he tweeted.

Perkins explained that he was selling the 10 month old dog because he was getting too big to be around his young children

Photographs soon followed showing the rather mean-looking young pouch, before Perkins tweeted again that the pet ‘needs to be gone by tomorrow.’

As well as several interested parties, the Thunder's center also received several messages either joking about his offer or taking him to task for his behavior.

One tweeter, Nick Scibelli, wrote: '@KendrickPerkins perk this isn't the way to get rid of a dog'

Another, Mike George added: '@KendrickPerkins I'm sure @MikeVick would give him a good home..'

Less than 45 minutes after his first tweet on the subject, Perkins had sold his dog

In April 2007, Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons was implicated in an illegal interstate dog fighting ring that had operated for five years. He pleaded guilty to federal felony charges and served 21 months in prison.

Despite the criticism and the humorous remarks, Perkins managed to find a new home for his dog less than 45 minutes after his first tweet.

'They dog sold yall,' Perkins tweeted his followers.
