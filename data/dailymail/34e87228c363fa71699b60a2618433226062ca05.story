Tickets are still available for the blockbuster Champions League match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium.

An article on City's official website, posted on Tuesday morning, said a limited selection of single-seat tickets would be on sale from the stadium ticket office in the hours up to kick-off. 

We asked Ric Turner of fan site Bluemoon just why City fans weren't flocking to arguably the club's biggest game of the season so far against one of the giants of European football.

Manchester City take on Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium in the Champions League on Tuesday night. It should be a prestigious occasion, with the reigning English champions taking on their German counterparts, yet tickets remain on open sale and the attendance is likely to be under 40,000. So, why is there seemingly such apathy amongs the City support for such a high-profile game?

Qualifying for the Champions League always seemed like the holy grail, competing with Europe’s elite sides on a regular basis, but now that we are actually there it feels like something of an anti-climax and it has failed to capture the imagination of City fans.

One factor is the tedium brought about by the flawed Champions League structure and seedings system. For the second year running we were drawn in a virtually identical group with both Bayern and CSKA Moscow. This will be the sixth time in four years that we have faced Munich. It’s dull and monotonous playing the same teams over and over again.

There is also a general disillusionment with UEFA at present; indeed, the City fans will stage a protest prior to kick-off on Tuesday evening. 

The main grievance relates to the away tie in Moscow, played in October. UEFA insisted that the game be played behind closed doors, leaving many City fans who had already paid for flights and hotels out of pocket and unable to claim compensation. 

To add insult to injury, around 350 CSKA fans were in the ground for the game regardless, making a mockery of the punishment. Their fine for racism and crowd trouble was eventually reduced to a paltry £79,000. City, meanwhile, were fined £49m for having the temerity to invest in their team and local community.

However, the overriding factor is, of course, economical. City’s support is predominantly working class and many people simply balk at paying £40 to see a game of football. Particularly when it comes just three days after another home game, costing a similar amount. Once you factor in that the game is on terrestrial television, and that Christmas is a matter of weeks away, then it’s not hard to see why ticket sales have been sluggish.

Man City find themselves bottom of Group E, with just two points to their credit so far and two games left

The likes of Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes may well sneer, but as multi-millionaire footballers they lost touch with the economic realities facing most people a long time ago. Rival fans, too, will no doubt chortle about it on social media, although I’ve never really understood the obsession with attendances.

Imagine being a grown man and mocking another club for the size of their crowds? I don’t feel superior to, say, a fan of Bury because they only get 3,000 at their games. You’d be an idiot if you did.

Rather than resorting to cheap point scoring, fans across the country should be working together to address the real issues at hand here: namely the rampant commercialisation of the game, and exponential ticket price increases that are preventing many working-class fans from attending football matches.
