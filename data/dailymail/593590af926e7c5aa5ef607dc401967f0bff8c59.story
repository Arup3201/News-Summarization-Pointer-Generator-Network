Outspoken new Health Minister Anna Soubry faced a Tory call to resign after saying she backed changing the law on assisted suicide.

The former television presenter, who joined the Government in last week’s reshuffle, said it was ‘ridiculous and appalling’ that Britons had to ‘go abroad to end their life’.

Ms Soubry immediately came under attack from fellow Tories, with one warning that any attempt to change the law would be ‘fiercely’ opposed.

Health Minister Anna Soubry has been asked to resign by Tories after calling for assisted suicide to be made legal

Tory MP Peter Bone dismissed her views as ‘totally wrong’.

He said: ‘If she wants to speak out like this on something that is matter for Parliament – not government – she should resign as a Minister and make them.’

Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘Any new right-to-die legislation will be rigorously fought by MPs from across the House.’

The outspoken remarks  put her on a collision course with new Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, with sources saying he would not appreciate ‘attention-seeking’ by members of his Ministerial team.

Assisted suicide is punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment.

Tony Nicklinson's lawyers failed to overturn the country's euthanasia law before he died at home last month after suffering from locked-in syndrome since 2005

However, 60 people have killed themselves with the help of friends or family in Britain since 2009.

Ms Soubry said that the laws governing how people could take their lives needed to ‘evolve’ to allow people to die at home. But the MP – who is also a barrister – made it clear she did not approve of allowing doctors to end patients’ lives.

‘The rules we have about who we don’t prosecute allow things to happen, but there’s a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about it,’ she said.

A Downing Street spokesman said the Government had no plans to legislate on assisted suicide, adding that if any new laws were proposed, MPs would be given a free vote.
