Jerry Sandusky's blunder-prone lawyer inadvertently made a mockery of his client's case today when he held an impromptu press conference outside the courthouse after the decision was made to waive the hearing.

Joe Amendola told reporters outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, that the grand jury report outlining the child sex-abuse charges was deeply flawed - including allegations that Penn State coach Mike 
McQueary witnessed Sandusky
rape a boy in a campus locker room and that he told this to Joe Paterno.

He said to them: 'If you believe this (allegation) then I suggest you dial 1-800-REALITY'

Unluckily for Joe Amendola - and Sandusky - it turns out this is the number for a gay-sex phone line with an opening message informing the caller it is the 'hottest place for triple-X action'.

Confront: Former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky arrives for a preliminary hearing at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, this morning where he will face his accusers

Oops: Attorney Joe Amendola speaks outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, telling reporters if they believe the accusations they can dial 1-800-REALITY

Officials at a Pennsylvania college say Jerry Sandusky had contact with its football programme last year despite being told he failed a background check when applying to be a volunteer coach.

Juniata College spokesman John Wall says Sandusky consulted for the school's former coach during the 2010 season despite the coach being informed Sandusky couldn't be associated with Juniata's program.

The college says Sandusky applied to volunteer in May 2010 but was turned down after the background check revealed an investigation by a high school where he'd volunteered.

Juniata was not told of the nature of the investigation, which ultimately led to child sex abuse charges.

Unnamed players tell the station that Sandusky was active in the programme.

'Get ready for bulging, bursting pleasure,' it continues.

The unorthodox lawyer has already been criticised 
for the way he has handled the disgraced former coach's case, which 
included giving him the green light to do a TV interview with NBC's Bob 
Costas and two days of interviews with the New York Times.

Amendola insists 67-year-old Sandusky 
is not the serial predator described by the grand jury and said that 
though his methods may be unorthodox, he has a plan.

He said on Saturday: 'I do have a strategy. There is a method
to my madness. This has been a well-thought-out strategy.'

Today's blunder will only add to the 
assumptions of legal experts, who wonder if the small-town solo 
practitioner has taken on more than he can handle.

Sandusky's decision to waive the 
preliminary hearing came as a shock, as Amendola previously said this 
was not an option, believing it to be an 'important opportunity for him 
to maintain his innocence'.

Shortly after arriving at a packed 
Centre County courthouse at 8am, he and Amendola and second attorney 
Karl Rominger, joined two prosecutors and a court reporter in the 
judge's chambers.Â 

After Magistrate Judge Robert Scott asked Sandusky if he understood he was waiving certain rights, the former coach said yes.

According to ABC, Sandusky briefly paused outside the courthouse afterwards and said: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters... We want the opportunity to present our side.'

When a reporter shouted to him: 'Sandusky, do you still maintain your innocence?', his attorney answered for him saying: 'Yes.'

Unbearable: Ben Andreozzi, an attorney for victim number four, holds a handwritten letter from his client, which told of going through 'the most difficult time of his life'

Leaving: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie sit in a car after departing from a hearing where he waived the right to have a preliminary trial

Following the decision, Harrisburg attorney Ben Andreozzi read a statement from his client, who is known as Victim Four which said: 'This is the most difficult time of my life. I can't put into words how unbearable this has been on my life, both physically and mentally.

'I can't believe they put us through this only to waive the hearing. Regardless of the decision to waive the hearing, nothing has changed. I still will stand my ground and testify the truth.'

Andreozzi told Penn Live the word 'truth' was underlined three times by his client, who would have been the first testify this morning but was only told of the decision at 8.30am.

The hearing was expected to last a 
day or more. Sandusky has denied the allegations, which led to the 
departures of longtime Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and the 
university president.

'This development we believe provides
maximum protection to most importantly the victims in this case,' said 
Senior Deputy Attorney General E. Marc Costanzo. 'It avoids their having
to testify for a second time. They will of course testify at a trial in
the case.'

Judgement day: Wearing a dark suit and with his wife Dottie by his side, he arrived at the courthouse where a judge will decide if the case will go to trial

Attorney: Joe Amendola, right, talks to reporters after a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to hold Sandusky for trial on charges of sexually abusing boys

Statement: Jerry Sandusky himself told reporters afterwards: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters...We want the opportunity to present our side'

Costanzo said the amount of publicity
generated by Sandusky's attorney made the decision unexpected, but said
the decision to waive was not unusual given the strength of the state's
case.

There have been no discussions about a
plea bargain, Costanzo said. Sandusky's next court appearance, an 
arraignment, is scheduled for January 11. He remains under house arrest.

Michael Boni, a lawyer for one of the
accusers, said he was encouraged by the development. The accusers 'do 
not have to relive the horrors they experience up on the witness stand' 
by having to testify at the hearing and at trial.

He
also said it may pave the way for a plea deal somewhere down the road 
but the prosecution said that was not even discussed today.

Sandusky, in a dark suit, entered the county courthouse through the back door this morning with his wife, Dottie, at his side.

He looked straight ahead, ignoring questions from reporters. Defense attorney Joseph Amendola followed him into the courthouse.

About 50 members of the media and 10 local residents, a few of them waiting with cameras to take pictures, awaited his arrival.

Witnesses have contended before the 
grand jury that Sandusky committed a range of sexual offenses against 
boys as young as 10, assaulting them in hotel swimming pools, the 
basement of his home in State College and in the locker room showers at 
Penn State, where the 67-year-old former assistant football coach once 
built a national reputation as a defensive mastermind.

Repeat: Sandusky was arrested and jailed on December 6 on new child sex abuse charges brought by two new accusers, including one who claims Sandusky molested him numerous times in a basement bedroom

The scandal has provoked strong 
criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop Sandusky, 
and prompted the departures of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno 
and the school's longtime president, Graham Spanier.

Sandusky,
67, has said repeatedly that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the 
case. In interviews with NBC and The New York Times, he said he showered
and 'horsed around' with boys but never sexually abused them.

Sandusky is free on $250,000 bail, but is subject to electronic monitoring and the equivalent of house arrest.

He also can have no contact with victims or witnesses and have no unsupervised contact with minors.

Last month Mr Sandusky told NBC's Bob Costas and The New York Times that his relationship to the boys who said he abused them was like that of an extended family.

Mr Sandusky characterized his experiences with the children as 'precious times' and said the physical aspect of the relationships 'just happened that way' and didn't involve abuse.

If the accusers stay true to what was in the grand jury report, the court will hear today that Sandusky often showered with them, put his hand on their legs during car rides, and showered them with presents, attention and trips to football games.

His advances allegedly ranged from soapy bear hugs in the shower to rape in his basement during sleepovers.

He admits showering with them but denies sexual contact.
