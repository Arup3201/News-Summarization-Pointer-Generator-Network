As businessman Geoffrey Edelsten is chased for millions by the Australian Tax Office and US creditors, it's now been revealed more than $30 million has been 'inexplicably' removed from his private trust account ledgers.

The Australian Taxation Office is pursuing the former doctor for $14,130,000 in taxes and penalties and a motion was filed in the US Bankruptcy Court on Friday regarding a secret settlement last month between Mr Edelsten and his creditors, namely Florida's Mawardi family, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The ATO says the US trustee liquidating Mr Edelsten's assets showed that it 'disproportionately favours (the) trust' and may have been unaware of $30.9 million in his Norman South Trust as of June, because that amount of money may not have been disclosed before the agreement.

The Daily Telegraph also reported the ATO motion said that as of 2012, Mr Edelsten extended a loan of $35.1 million to his own trust.

It said the settlement, which seeks to distribute funds from assets such as apartment complexes in the US, an airplane and homes and cars in Australia, was unreasonable.

The reason being because it did not consider a 'sizeable loan Edelsten extended to the trust that was removed inexplicably from later financial statements.

He filed for bankruptcy in the US earlier this year and was described by a US judge as being 'self servingly ambiguous' about his assets.

Mr Edelsten declined to comment saying it was 'against the law'.
