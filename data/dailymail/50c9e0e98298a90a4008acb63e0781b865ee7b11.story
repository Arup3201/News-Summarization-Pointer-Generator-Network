Spain joined an unwanted list in the history books by becoming the fifth world champions to be knocked out in the group stage. Sportsmail take a look back at the other four champions who embarrassingly fell at the first hurdle.

Italy 1950

The Italians were the long-standing defending champions, having won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 - with a 12-year gap until the next tournament in 1950.

Their national team was weakened with some of the side sadly dying in the Superga air disaster a year before the start of the tournament and the champions were not keen to attend the finals.

Surrender: Italian representatives present the jules Rimet Cup to their Brazilian counterparts

After some persuasion they travelled to Brazil, but by boat rather than plane.

They lost 3-2 to Sweden before beating Paraguay 2-0 but it wasn't enough and the Italians were on their way home - again by boat.

Brazil 1966

The Selecao won their second World Cup in 1962, beating
Czechoslovakia 3-1 in the final, but failed to clear the first stage at the
following tournament in England, despite a star showing from Pele and Garrincha
in their opening 2-0 victory over Bulgaria.

That win was marred by an injury to Pele, and the forward
missed their second match, a 3-1 defeat to Hungary.

Winners: Brazil's 1962 captain Mauro picks up the Jules Rimet Cup - but it was not so easy four years later

Star: Brazil boasted Pele in their ranks in '62 and '66 but he failed to inspire them in the latter

He recovered to start in
the third and all-important game against Portugal, only for sidekick Garrincha
to be ruled out.

Without the two working in tandem Brazil were easily beaten by
a Portugal side inspired by Eusebio and with that Vicente Feola’s side were
out.

France 2002

After thrashing Brazil in the 1998 final in front of their
own fans in Paris, France began the following tournament in the worst possible
fashion.

Tournament debutants Senegal pulled off one of the biggest
World Cup upsets ever in the opening match, as Papa Bouba Diop scored in a
shock 1-0 victory over Les Bleus.

Elation: France looked unstoppage as they produced a perfect performance in the 1998 final to beat Brazil 3-0

Crashing down: But four years later they were a laughing stock. Sylvain Wiltord couldn't believe it

In their second Group A match, France failed to find a way
past Uruguay, with the game finishing 0-0. The holders’ star striker Thierry
Henry was sent off in that game to compound their misery.

A limp 2-0 defeat to Denmark sent France crashing out after
just three games. Their failure to score a single goal earned them the record
of worst ever World Cup performance by a defending champion.

Italy 2010

Four years on from the drama of their penalty shootout win
in the 2006 final against France, Italy flew to South Africa with a strong
squad intent on defending their crown.

Drawn in a seemingly easy group with Paraguay, New Zealand
and Slovakia, pundits tipped Italy to saunter into the knockout stages.

Rejects: But the Italians were made to look stupid after crashing out of a seemingly simple group

How
wrong they were.

After being held to 1-1 draws by Paraguay and New Zealand,
they lost 3-2 in their final group game to Slovakia, becoming the third nation
to be eliminated in the first round as reigning champions.

All over: Sergio Ramos rues Spain's defeat to Chile which ends their reign as World Cup holders

Spain 2014

Casillas and the centre-back pairing of 
Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique looked like they had never met before, let
 alone won a World Cup and two European championships together.

Vicente Del Bosque made two changes for 
their second group game against Chile, not that it helped. Barcelona 
pair Gerard Pique and Xavi were replaced by Bayern Munich utility man 
Javi Martinez and their speedy club teammate Pedro.

Napoli 
forward Eduardo Vargas gave Jorge Sampaoli’s side a deserved lead with a
 calm finish in the 19th minute, before an improvised Charles Aranguiz 
toe-poke doubled their lead three minutes before the break.

Despite
 bringing Fernando Torres on after the break Spain still struggled to 
create chances, and the defeat dumped them out of the World Cup with one
 round of group stage matches still to play.

Adios: Jordi Alba and Ramos couldn't pick themselves up from a two-goal deficit to keep Spain in the competition
