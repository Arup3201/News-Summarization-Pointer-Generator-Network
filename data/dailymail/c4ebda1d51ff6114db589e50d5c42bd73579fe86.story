From the suburban home of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, to the 525,000ft tall Mega Maid in Spaceballs – one designer has created the ultimate guide to baddies’ lairs.

The interactive infographic by a California-based estate agency called Movoto features 40 of the most iconic homes and hideaways of famous TV and film villains.

Hovering over each evil residence shows the villain who lived there, the estimated size of the property, as well as added features that helped the baddie commit their crimes.

The interactive infographic by a California-based estate agency Movoto features 40 of the most iconic homes and hideaways of famous TV and film villains, including the smallest - the Chum Bucket from Spongebob Squarepants

The smallest residence on the list is The Chum Bucket from the Spongebob Squarepants TV show.

It is listed as 3.75ft tall and is home to Plankton, the rival restaurant owner trying to steal the recipe of The Krabby Patty from Spongebob’s favourite Krusty Krab.

By comparison, Dr Evil’s lair from the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is 3,500ft tall. It is built into a volcano in the Caribbean but isn’t particularly discreet due to the fact Dr Evil’s face, played by Mike Myers, is carved into the side.

There are not many Disney lairs in the top 40. Ursula's magical cave from The Little Mermaid measures 70ft tall and is also home to her serpent sidekicks. It is here that Ariel traded her voice for legs

Its special features include being surrounded by liquid hot magma and housing a full size piano.

The Death Star from Star Wars is the largest villainous retreat to feature in Movoto's infographic.

Home to Lord Vader, it measures 524,934ft in diameter and includes a garbage chamber and giant super laser capable of destroying entire planets.

In contrast, Los Pollos Hermanos from Breaking Bad is just 40ft wide. It is the hideout and cover for Gustavo Fring and his drugs operation.

The Death Star is a fictional space station and superweapon appearing in the Star Wars science-fiction franchise created by George Lucas. It is capable of destroying an entire planet with its powerful superlaser

The infographic describes its special features as: 'Nothing special outside being a perfect cover'.

Other iconic lairs include the Bates Motel from the film Psycho, the Jolly Roger - the mobile home of Captain Hook - and Malfoy Manor, which Voldemort and his band of death eaters used as a base in the seventh book of the Harry Potter series.

Natural lairs include the Grinch's Mt. Crumpet, Normanisan Island from the Incredibles movie and Lonely Mountain, which is Smaug's hide-out in The Hobbit.

Futuristic lairs range from the Crucible space station, which measures 5,24,934ft in diameter and was home to the Darleks from Dr.Who, the Death Star from Star Wars and the Borg Cube from Star Trek First Contact (all pictured)

Futuristic lairs range from the Crucible space station, which measures 5,24,934ft in diameter and was home to the Darleks from Dr.Who, to the Borg Cube from the Star Trek film  First Contact.

The cubes have been used by the Borg Queen and are capable of eliminating all life on a planet in 24 hours.

Measuring 9,964ft wide, each cube has a crew size of 130,000, a tractor beam to paralyse opposing ships and a cutting beam to destroy vehicles, among other weapons.

The Borg cube is the primary starship class of the Borg Collective's fleet. They are designed as a combined weapons platform and factory and their main purpose is to destroy the military capacity of a species and assimilate the survivors into the Collective
