Gyms face a crackdown on rip-off rules that allow them to impose punishing charges on users who try to cancel their contracts.

Thousands sign up each January because of New Year resolutions to lose weight and get fit.

However, many contracts carry small-print clauses that lock customers into long-term deals – up to 24 months – and make it difficult to quit.

Fine print: Gyms face a crackdown on rip-off rules after many contracts were found to carry small-print clauses that lock customers into long-term deals - up to 24 months - and make it difficult to quit

The Office of Fair Trading has taken one company responsible for 700 gyms to court over unfair contract terms and put others on notice to clean up their act.

Currently, a customer who loses their job a few months after joining a gym and tries to get out of their contract can be hit with penalty charges equivalent to the remaining length of the deal, which could be more than £700.

The OFT is expected to announce that it will outlaw contracts that last longer than 12 months or do not contain a get-out clause for members who lose their job or sustain an injury.

Virgin Active has already responded by changing its contracts to give customers better rights to cancel.

The OFT has also been looking at the small-print rules of major chains such as LA Fitness, Fitness First and Bannatyne’s.

OFT spokesman Cavendish Elithorn said: ‘We are investigating a number of companies that operate fitness club chains or provide management services to gyms over concerns about unfair terms or business practices.

‘These include tying consumers into lengthy terms with  limited rights to cancel should their circumstances change, and using misleading debt collection practices.’ 

The OFT’s investigation stems from a court case involving Ashbourne Management Services, which draws up agreements and collects payments for 700 gyms. The judge ruled that a gym contract was unfair if it ran for longer than 12 months and did not allow the consumer to cancel with 30 days’ notice and a moderate penalty.

Virgin Active is extending the period during which members who are made redundant may give notice to end their membership from one month after their redundancy to two. It is also extending the ability to cancel membership following loss of employment to those who lose their job in circumstances other than redundancy.

Several gyms have already cut their contracts to a maximum of 12 months, while some, such as Fitness First, offer one-month and four-month deals. Bannatyne’s said it did not offer contracts longer than 12 months.
