Raheem Sterling was partying at a London nightclub until 3am just a day after he complained about being 'too tired' to play for England, it was revealed today.

The Liverpool winger did not start the Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia because of fatigue but 24 hours later went to Cirque le Soir with national team mates Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

One partygoer said she saw him 'up on his chair dancing' at the West End club with dwarves, snakes, bearded ladies and fire eaters to entertain customers.

Raheem's journey to London started from Tallinn, where he played the last 26 minutes of England's 1-0 win because manager Roy Hodgson said he was suffering with 'fatigue'.

After flying back to Manchester straight after the game on October 12 the following day he travelled 200-plus miles to London to meet with Arsenal duo Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain and Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. 

A woman at the club told The Sun Sterling was the centre of attention at the club, with the DJ repeatedly shouting his name. 

She said a friend joked: 'My dad's a Liverpool fan and he'll be furious to see this. People were aware of the England match and the tiredness comments.' 

Another clubber said: 'I saw Raheem there. I don't know what time he was out till but I'm pretty sure he had a good time.'

Roy Hodgson and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers were forced to hold takes after Raheem Sterling complained of fatigue ahead of England’s win in Estonia.

The 19-year-old jad first admitted leg weariness to coach Gary Neville last Saturday during England’s final training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. 

Sterling told Hodgson on Saturday he was struggling with tiredness and form and was replaced in the starting line-up by Adam Lallana for England's 1-0 victory in the Euro 2016 qualifier.

Roy Hodgson elected to use Sterling off the bench after the midfielder claimed he was 'too tired' to start

But the 19-year-old came off the bench to win the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored the winning goal.

Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you tell the truth. We were doing a light session. Just before we started, Raheem came to me and said "look I really am feeling a bit tired".

Last week, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers defended his young star, insisting Sterling had not refused to play for his country.

He said: 'This is a boy that felt a bit tired but he didn't say he didn't want to play. He's a human being, not a machine.' 

However, the revelations will heap more controversy on the 19-year-old as he prepares to face European champions Real Madrid in the Champions League at Anfield tonight.

Sterling and his representatives last night declined to comment.
