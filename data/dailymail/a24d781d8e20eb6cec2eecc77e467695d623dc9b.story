It may look like its glory days are far far behind it - but this rusting Mini is expected to fetch £15,000 at auction.

It has been left untouched and unloved in a Chichester barn since 1986, but it now emerges that the car is the world’s oldest original Mini.

The decrepit motor was the eighth to be made when it rolled off the production line in 1959 and despite is poor condition, the vehicle is being described as a ‘classic’.

Rusty: The grey paint work on the Mini is still visible in place, but the car is still far from roadworthy

Enthusiasts keen on the prospect of returning the dusty Austin Mini Se7en De Luxe Saloon to its original condition are expected to drive up its price.

The vehicle was bought by a David Gallimore in 1986 from a Gladys Hobro of Aldwick, Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

Mr Gallimore kept the car, which originally cost £497 and has a 848cc engine, in a Chichester barn until last year.

The Mini has just 30,000 miles on the clock, but after rusting away for more than two decades doesn’t actually work.

Interior: The basic design is a far cry from modern luxuries such as air conditioning and electric windows

Through the rust it is possible to 
glimpse the original Farina Grey paintwork, and it retains the original 
registration plate: XLL 27.

The interior is basic, but has all the original features including its only dashboard instrument - a speedometer.

It was built in July 1959 at Longbridge, Warwicks, three months before the model went into full production.

Workings: The Mini was designed in the 1950s at a time of fuel shortages and its engine is just 848cc

It was then sent to Car Mart Limited in 
Colchester, Essex, where it was first sold. It has emerged again in 
need a full make-over: inside, outside and under the bonnet.

John Polson, from Bonhams which is selling the car, said: 'This is a wonderful opportunity to buy the car and restore it. It is the oldest unrestored Mini.

'Collectors love the fact it has had very little done to it since it was built. It was the eight to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives.

Glory: Despite its run down condition the Mini retains many of the features that made it such an influential car

'The Mini is one of the most important cars of the 20th century. They have always been collectable.

'Some collectors would want to return her to new, but others would just like to get her going again and keep her in the original condition.'

It is thought that only three Minis earlier than this one exist today, but they have all been restored over the years.

One is at the British Heritage Motor Centre Museum in Warwickshire, and the other two are in private collections in Japan.

In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T.

Its design came about because the Suez Crisis meant that the country was short of petrol, and smaller cars were required.

The sale is on April 30 at The Royal Airforce Museum in London.
