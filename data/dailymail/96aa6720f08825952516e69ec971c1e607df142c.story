Sir Alex Ferguson has sympathised with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, and says he 'never played against any West Ham team that played football I was afraid of.'

The legendary United manager, writing in updated chapters of his autobiography, said he didn't understand Hammers supporters' insistence on the 'West Ham way'.

The 72-year-old claims the 'way' is a myth that he never saw in his 26 years as Manchester United manager, and backed Allardyce's style as good management. 

Sir Alex Ferguson says West Ham fans expect too much of Sam Allardyce, who did well to keep them up

Ferguson insists that he has never understood the 'West Ham way' and that the Hammers never scared him

West Ham's last major trophy came in 1980, when the won the FA Cup, beating Arsenal at Wembley

* I spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but dressing-room was out of bounds

* I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as Manchester United assistant manager

*Louis van Gaal is formidable... and he and Ryan Giggs can learn from each other  

Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow 

* Liverpool were definitely the team of last seasson... even Manchester United fans couldn't begrudge their nemesis an impressive sruge up the table

And Ferguson also insisted that all the West Ham sides he'd faced as United boss had been either negative in their approach or lucky. 

'I hope that before I die someone can explain the "West Ham way", writes Ferguson in his updated book. 'What is it? They last won a trophy in 1980, the FA Cup. 

'I never played against any West Ham team that played football I was afraid of. They were always surviving, or lucky as hell against us.'  

Ferguson also labelled last season's West Ham squad as 'a team of very average players' who were helped by Allardyce.

The Hammers, who currently sit fourth in the Premier League table after an excellent start to the season, finished with 40 points last year, seven clear of the relegation zone.

And fans were extremely critical of Allardyce's style of football throughout last season, something which Ferguson thinks was uncalled for.

'There is this preconception with West Ham fans that Big Sam is a survivalist who tells teams to boot the ball up the pitch. 

'The truth is that he stayed up with a team of very average players. That’s management. He drew the best from them.'
