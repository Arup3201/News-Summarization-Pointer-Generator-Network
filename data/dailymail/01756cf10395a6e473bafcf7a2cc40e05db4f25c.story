Bristol's Peter Nunn denies sending abusive messages to a Labour MP after she supported a campaign to have Jane Austen on banknotes

A twitter troll bombarded a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to feature Jane Austen on £10 notes, a court heard yesterday.

Peter Nunn, 33, is said to have passed on the ‘menacing’ messages threatening to rape Stella Creasy and calling her an ‘evil witch’.

Miss Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, was deluged with offensive messages after she backed a high-profile social media  campaign to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes.

The court heard Nunn both retweeted and composed messages in which  campaigners were threatened.

Feminist Caroline Criado-Perez launched the Austen campaign in July after the Bank of England replaced social activist Elizabeth Fry with Sir Winston Churchill on £5 notes. The Bank then announced the Pride And Prejudice author would replace Charles Darwin on the £10 note.

Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court Nunn ‘embarked on a campaign of hatred in various different forms towards both women’.

He is said to have posted messages from two separate Twitter accounts and retweeted a message sent to Miss Creasy which read: ‘You better watch your back, I’m going to rape your **** at 8pm and put the video all over.’

Miss Morgan said: ‘It is not alleged that he created the text and the threat, but for whatever reason he chose to retweet it and it is a message that is menacing in character.’  

Nunn, it is said, then sent other offensive messages to the MP.

He allegedly wrote: ‘If you can’t threaten to rape a celebrity, what is the point in having them?’

After he was banned from Twitter, he 
is accused of creating another account and writing: ‘I’m here again to 
tell you that I’ll rape you tomorrow at 6pm.’

The
 court heard that Nunn, a self-styled blogger from Bristol, also left 
offensive posts in which he called the campaigners witches.

Miss
 Morgan told the court that while the entries do not form part of the 
criminal charge, they show the ‘hatred’ he had for the women.

She said: ‘They demonstrate the state of mind of the defendant at the time at which he was sending the reported tweets.’

Nunn
 defended his action in a series of video diaries, saying: ‘It’s 
entirely ridiculous – an MP and someone else got a few messages saying 
“I’m going to rape you”. I’ve had it before, you can’t go to the police 
they’ve enough to do. They’re looking for murderers and proper rapists.’

When Nunn was arrested he admitted he had retweeted  messages that were violent, but said he did so ‘to further debate’.

He
 denies sending a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, 
obscene or menacing character by a public electronic network. The charge
 carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.

The case was adjourned for reports until September.

The campaign to get writer Jane Austen on banknotes was a success, but both women suffered a barrage of hate as a response to their support for it
