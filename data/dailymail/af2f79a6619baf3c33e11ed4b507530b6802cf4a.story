A pair of classic leather shoes is an ideal, time-tested Christmas gift for a British gent.

But look closely at the stack heels of cobbler Oliver Sweeney's new designs as each one conceals a tiny bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch.

The smart Oxford-style shoes are the world's first brogues to hide miniature bottles of whisky  and at £295, are the latest designer gift for the man who has everything.

There are only 130 pairs made by the British men's footwear and accessories label.

Each pair took two days to make out of calf leather and feature the initials 'JW' stitched on the back of the shoe.

The stitching, the inner sole and the shoes' dust bag is all red to reflect the signature colour of the blend while the leather is tanned the same shade as the Scotch.

Each of the  brogues, with their signature hole-punched patterns, feature the iconic Johnnie Walker 'striding man' tattooed directly on to the leather of the heel.

The only suggestion that there's a bottle of the strong stuff hidden in a suede-lined recess in the stacked heel comes from the metal screwtop peeping out of its hidden compartment.

Buyers will also receive a bottle of ginger ale and a recipe card to make the new cocktail Johnnie and Ginger, which combines one part whisky, three parts ginger ale and a wedge of lime over ice.

Oliver Sweeney and Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky collaborated to create the limited edition footwear

The Johnnie Walker Oliver Sweeney Brogues are part of the whisky's Bold Collections project, a series of ventures combining drinks and design.

Oliver Sweeney's Cobbler-In-Chief, Tim Cooper, described the partnership between the shoemakers and the classic Scotch as 'a fun project which we've been absolutely passionate about perfecting.'

He said: 'Always obsessing over detail and the best construction methods, we take our time to select the right materials and components to give you real quality and distinctive style.'

He said the partnership with Johnnie Walker feels like 'the perfect fit' and added, 'we hope you enjoy our amusing take on a style classic'.

A spokesperson for Johnnie Walker said: 'We are hugely excited to work with Oliver Sweeney, an iconic brand which is renowned for its craftsmanship and bold style. 

'Our limited edition brogue matches the intrepid and sophisticated characteristics of Johnnie Walker Red Label perfectly.'
