Two schoolgirls survived being buried alive when a section of cliff collapsed on them as they walked on a beach.

The friends were saved by a group of three men who dug them out with their bare hands after a 10-year-old boy raised the alarm.

The girls are believed to have been trying to climb the 30ft tall shallow sandy cliff face when it suddenly collapsed at Hemsby beach, Norfolk.

Rescue: Kenny Chaney, 66, who helped to dig out the schoolgirls after a section of cliff collapsed on them at Hemsby beach, Norfolk

One girl aged about 12 was buried up to her neck at the base of the cliff while her nine-year-old friend was trapped up to her chest six feet up.

The incident happened around four miles away from where Paige Anderson, 15, was buried when a tunnel she was digging collapsed last August.

Retired fisherman Kenny Chaney, 66, and two holidaymakers frantically dug the girls out after they were buried on Good Friday.

The coastguard and fire service were alerted but the girls were dug out before they arrived.

The girls are thought to have been staying at a nearby holiday park.

They were playing alone on the beach when around 30 tonnes of sand collapsed.

Mr Chaney, who was metal detecting nearby, said: 'They were very lucky not to have been killed. They could easily have suffocated in the sand if it had gone over their heads.

'A family were apparently walking along the beach and saw the cliff coming down. They must have heard the girls screaming and went over to help.

'I didn’t hear or see it happen, but a boy aged about ten in this family group ran to get me and said "Two girls have been buried in an avalanche".

'I raced over to help these two other men. We were all digging at the sand with our hands to get them out.

'I had a little spade with me, but I didn’t want to risk using it in case I injured them. It was a difficult job because more sand was pouring down the cliff as we dug the sand out from around them.

'The girls were panicking and freaking out. They didn’t know if they were going to get out alive. One girl was buried up to her neck and the other up to her chest.

'I was worried that the whole lot was going to come down on all of us. It was pretty vertical there and there’s a lot of weight in it. We were all drawing out the sand with our bare hands.

'It felt a long while when I kept digging and the sand kept collapsing in. I just put my two hands together and kept scooping it out.

'They were very lucky they didn’t get completely buried or nobody would have seen them.'

Mr Chaney said the girls appeared ‘deeply shocked’, but had no other apparent injury.

He said: 'We lay them down on the beach after we pulled them out. They were both completely freaking out.'

An adult turned up a short while later who is believed to be one of their fathers.

Three fire engines, two ambulances and local lifeboat men arrived on the scene just minutes after the terrified girls had been pulled from the sand. They did not need hospital treatment.

Ross Hewitt, coxswain of Hemsby Lifeboat, issued a warning about the dangers of playing around cliffs.

He said: 'The major risk is death. Luckily for the girls, there was someone on the beach, but apart from them there was nobody else.

'They could have been stuck there for who knows how long.

'It’s an important message we’ve got to get out and we will be speaking to the council about getting warning signs by the cliffs. It’s something I feel is lacking. We want to keep the beach busy and keep it safe.'
