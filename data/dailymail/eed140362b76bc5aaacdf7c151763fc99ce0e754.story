The man who was put behind bars for obsessively texting his former girlfriend before she fell 11 storeys to her death has been released from jail after just 10 days as neighbours recount what they witnessed on that fateful night.

Cheerleader Breeana Robinson, 21, fell from the balcony of the Gold Coast high-rise apartment of her controlling boyfriend, Dan Shearin in January last year. 

Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail on October 27 after pleading guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass Ms Robinson who received 1,439 text messages from him before she died.

At what was expected to be a straight forward bail application at Southport District Court on Thursday, Judge Terence Martin recommended Shearin's lawyers appeal the case, Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

'If the words were spoken face-to-face, there would be no illegality,' Judge Martin said. 'He can't be punished for having a bad personality.'

Meanwhile, Gina and Buddy Hadid, who live on the fourth floor of the same building as Shearin, have spoken out about what they saw the night that Ms Robinson plummeted to her death. 

'Never ever will I forget this in my life. It will stay in me for the rest of my life,' Gina told ACA.

'I just heard her scream, something go past me fast, like a flash of light.'

'I'm 100 percent sure I heard her saying 'no' or 'oh no'. So I did hear her screaming and saying something when she went past me.' 

'I went to look over and I saw her lying there, not moving in her underwear and I quickly ran inside and called to my husband 'Buddy wake up, call the police.' 

Buddy Hadid and a security guard were the first to reach Ms Robinson.

'I called the ambulance on my phone. I was talking to the ambulance. The security guard and I were taking it in turns one was doing CPR and one was talking to the ambulance and then we swapped over, 'Mr Hadid said.

Mr Haddin said he first saw Shearin within a minute of exiting the building.

'We were trying to work out who she was and he just turned around and said "oh that's my girlfriend",' Mr Haddin said.

'He was perfectly calm, he was calmer than what I was.' 

Just seven days after his girlfriend's death, Shearin went on a holiday to Bali where he posted pictures of himself enjoying massages.

When he returned from his trip, Mr Hadid claims Shearin threw a party at the same unit where Ms Robinson fell from.

Judge Martin said Shearin should receive bail because his appeal was unable to be heard before November 17.

In the 38 days Ms Robinson was with Shearin before she fell to her death he sent her 1439 text messages, Southport Magistrate's Court heard earlier this month.

At 10.35pm on January 29, 2013 after she returned from cheerleading practice Ms Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport.

The athletic, but slight, young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. 

The court heard evidence that in one text message sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin said: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'.

In another text message sent to Breanna that was heard in court, Shearin said: 'You're a complete f***ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c***'.

Police investigating the death charged Shearin with using a carriage service to menace or harass Ms Robinson. He pleaded guilty.

Ms Robinson, who was legally blind from a young age, had been drawn to cruise ship entertainer Shearin through his promises of helping the pretty blonde to realise her dreams of a dancing career.

Shearin, who describes himself on Google Plus as 'Australia's premiere cruise ship vocalist/author & cruise ship specialist' was Ms Robinson's first boyfriend. 

Shearin, who friends of Ms Robinson's said is obsessed with Facebook and dating sites, has called girls 'bitches' and a 'psycho' on another of his Facebook pages.

On September 21, he posted, 'Haha. I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection. One has set up an account on grindr with my phone number thinking that it might somehow embarrass me.

'Talk about psycho just coz she couldn't f*** me lol. She is so stupid that she doesn't realise that it is a criminal offence these days.'

Friends of Ms Robinson told Daily Mail Australia how the 'lovely young woman' who had struggled at school because of a chronic astigmatism called 'cat's eye', would have done anything to become a dancer.

'She believed Dan would help her achieve that goal,' the friend said, on condition of anonymity.

'She was the sweetest, kindest person, unaffected and always apologising,' the friend said.

Ms Robinson, who was unable to drive a car because of her sight problems, fought to be independent, and had travelled overseas to see the Moulin Rouge in Paris.

'She idolised Gold Coast dancer Anthony Ikin,' the friend said. 

'She knew she couldn't be a Moulin Rouge dancer, but she hoped to dance professionally and that's how she and [Dan Shearin] met.

'He promised to help her get work on cruise ships.'

Shearin has written a book, Confessions of a Neurotic Cruise Ship Singer, which has a subtext of sex and romance.

Shearin, who recently returned from a trip to Canada to appear at Southport Court, has reportedly fronted 'Las Vegas style' productions says on his Facebook page he has performed 'in over 30 different shows on cruise ships'.

On June 15 this year, he posted on Facebook, 'It just dawned one day as I walked along the beach that no matter how many dating sites I join, however many places I go, or how much time I spend searching for the right woman, none of it is going to speed up the process because the Universe has a plan and when the time is right, she will appear no matter how much time I spend in solitary.'

'Time to live life and stop waiting.'

On July 25, he posted: 'So sad to hear that another young woman has committed suicide from a Surfers hi-rise tonight. 

'My heart goes out to her family and all those innocent people who saw her land.

'Having witnessed this exact same situation myself, I hope those affected seek counselling.'

Following Ms Robinson's death, Shearin moved from the H20 apartment block and is now believed to be working for a Gold Coast time share company.

The investigation into the 21-year-old's death remains open.
