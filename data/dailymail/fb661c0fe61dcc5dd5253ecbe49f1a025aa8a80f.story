Alleged thieves: Brian and John Vetrulli Jr. were jailed Saturday in Montgomery County on charges of theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property

Police say the Gilbertsville men stole 13 sewer grates from area parking lots since the beginning of December and had receipts showing they'd sold more than 1,000 grates to scrap-metal dealers.

Each grate weighs about 100 pounds and costs about $475. Police say the Vetrullis sold them for $9 each.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 30.

ABC reports that  the men confessed to stealing as much as $500,000 worth of grates - more than 1,000 from Philadelphia, Limerick, Collegeville, Plymouth Meeting, Willow Grove, Abington, Bensalem, Haverford, Broomall, Upper Providence, and Montgomeryville.
