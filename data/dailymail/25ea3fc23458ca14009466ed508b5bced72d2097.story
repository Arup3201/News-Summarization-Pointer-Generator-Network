Watching Cristiano Ronaldo slam home two more penalties on his way to eight goals in three games on Tuesday night it occurred to me just how much of a certainty it is that he will score every time Real Madrid are awarded a spot-kick. 

You could hang a couple of car tyres from the cross-bar, tell him the goal will only count if he puts the ball through one of them, then put two goalkeepers on the line… and he would still bury it.

‘It’s not normal’ is what so many rival coaches have said about him since he embarked on his one-man quest to become Real Madrid’s all-time top goal scorer five years ago. And no, it isn’t normal.

Luis Enrique, long before he was Barcelona manager, once commented that what made Lionel Messi so incredible was not so much what he did, because all players are capable of a mazy dribble and a clever lobbed finish; especially in training or when they are developing as youngsters playing against players who are far inferior and who will never make the grade.

No, the incredible thing about Messi was that he did it against great players in big games and he did it all the time, every week. He made fellow professionals look like the ‘not-very good’ kids in the playground.

That is exactly what Ronaldo does. Take a top-flight keeper who week-in, week-out makes great saves and against the Portuguese football becomes a game of fetch – fetch the ball from the back of the net.

Commanding central defenders are reduced to spectators in the penalty area as he leaps to head home another cross. Full backs look slow as he powers past them. That ability to be the perfect winger and the perfect centre forward in one player is another thing that makes him stand out.

Here are just some of the records Cristiano Ronaldo currently holds:

Forget for one moment the debate about him being the greatest player, is there a better header of the ball in world football at the moment? Almost definitely not. Some players have the spring, some have the direction in the header, the timing, the ability to hang in the air – Ronaldo has the lot.

Then there is the desire to score as many goals as possible in every game. The fury when he misses a late chance to score a fifth. The wild celebration that greeted his insignificant fourth in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon last year.

But for Ronaldo there is no such thing as an insignificant goal. Each one counts, every strike is another chip chiselled out of the block of stone from which he is making a statue of himself that will stand outside the Bernanbeu long after he retires. 

Only injury or a move away in the next couple of seasons will prevent him from becoming the club’s all-time top scorer and if he wins another European Cup someone who is every bit as important to them as Alfredo Di Stefano was.

Years            Club                       Apps Goals 

2002-2003     Sporting Lisbon       31      5

2003-2009     Manchester United  292    118

2009-             Real Madrid             254    264

2003-             Portugal                   114    50

Is he the club’s greatest goalscorer of all time? If he scores more than anyone else surely that argument will be settled?

There will always be those who argue it is easy to score in the current Spanish league with its huge gulfs in budget between teams. But Spanish football has dominated European competition in recent years with Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao all making their mark. 

In the last 10 years six Europa League-winning clubs have hailed from Spain. It’s not a two-team affair and Ronaldo has scored against everybody.

It’s true there are a couple of featherweights at the bottom of the table, sides against which the last 10 minutes of matches can resemble Monday morning shooting practice but, all the same, such opponents still need to be beaten into submission and invariably it’s Ronaldo who has gleefully performed that task.

With stories of a possible return to Manchester United some commentators last week raised eyebrows at the idea of signing Ronaldo aged 30 (as he will be next year). Can anyone see the decline? Does he not look physically just the same as he did five years ago. There is no reason why he can’t remain at his peak for another five years.

Five more frightening years to add to the 25 hat-tricks and the 264 goals in 254 games. Raul is the club’s current top scorer on 323 goals. It took him 15 seasons and 741 games. 

Raul was a great player. Ronaldo makes the greatness of others look ordinary.
