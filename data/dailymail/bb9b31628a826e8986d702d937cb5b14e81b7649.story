In just a few decades they have escaped total extinction after being saved by breeders.

The Hucul horses are pictured frolicking in the meadows and forests near Odrzechowa in southeastern Poland.

The Hucul is a small primitive breed of sturdy pony which were used as pack horses to carry heavy loads over treacherous paths in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe.

In the 19th century, the Huculs were used by the Austro-Hungarian Army and in Czechoslovakia in World War Two.

However, the numbers of ponies rapidly declined and by the 1970s there were only around 300 horses left.

But breeding programmes were put in place and the horses are now thriving and it is thought there are now thousands living in Eastern Europe.

The horses are often used now by tourists and keen equestrians for trekking into the mountains.

The horses run in a field together after scientists and farmers in Poland and across eastern Europe worked together to help the breed avoid extinction 

Hucul ponies, or Carpathian ponies, were used widely in the Second World War after becoming renowned for their hardiness and endurance 

The breed became threatened after the conflict, with only 300 of the ponies recorded in Czechoslovakia, where they originate from  

Thanks to a number of breeding programmes in Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic, there are now an estimated 1,000 Hucul ponies in the world 

One of the ponies presents its flaring nostrils at a camera while enjoying the meadows and forests in Poland. It is one of a number to have been born with the help of the breeding initiatives 

The horses graze in the sun in Odrzychowa in south east Poland as it is revealed the breed is safe from extinction despite a drastic decline in numbers since the Second World War 

The ponies originate from the Carpathian Mountains in eastern Europe and are considered one of the oldest breeds of horse in the world

A group of trekkers are taken through shallow water on an organised excursion in Poland where farmers have restored the breed's population 

The ponies, now safeguarded by the efforts of scientists devoted to maintaining its population, graze in a field with a number accounting for their herd painted beneath their manes
