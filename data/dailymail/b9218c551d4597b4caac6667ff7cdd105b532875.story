Veteran cabbie Gene Salomon has seen it all -- encounters with the mafia, lovesick couples, and even Leonardo DiCaprio.

Salomon, who has worked as a taxi driver for 36 years, told The New York Post that despite the lack of job benefits, he gets personal fulfillment from the stories he collects on the job.

'I have more stories than the Empire State Building,' he said.

Salomon's stories, including his run-in with Leonardo DiCaprio, are to be released in his memoir 'Confessions of a Taxi Driver' on January 28.

In it, he recalls meeting the future Titanic star and 'king of the world.'

Salomon told the Post that in 1996, DiCaprio hopped into his cab, asking 'Don't you know who I am?'

When Salomon said he didn't, he says DiCaprio rattled off a string of films he starred in -- and the two hit it off as he drove the young star to a nightclub.

Salomon has fond memories of the star, and says he asked 'Who was the biggest celebrity tipper you ever had in your cab?'

Salomon allegedly told him John McEnroe gave him double the meter price -- and was shocked to see DiCaprio one-up him.

'Well,' DiCaprio reportedly said. 'I'm gonna give you triple the meter!'

Salomon told the paper he's had 114 celebrity clients over the years -- including Lauren Bacall, Sean Penn, Dennis Hopper. He was even lucky enough to have two cab rides with Paul Simon.

Salomon reportedly told the singer 'I want you to buy the Yankees.'

'Me? You want me to buy the Yankees?' Simon said, the paper reports. 'I don't have that kind of money. You should talk to McCartney.'

Salomon also recalls many other stories -- including couples attempting to have sex in the back of his cab.

'With me, I do find it offensive, but my level of resentment seems to depend on the way the passenger goes about it [...] I do get annoyed if they’re pretending I’m not even there,' he told the Post.

Salomon says one couple leaving the Bowery Hotel attempted to have sex in his cab -- only to be spotted by a female police officer.

Though the couple initially ignored her warnings, they eventually stopped when she yelled, 'Hey, you, lady in the taxi -- get off that guy right now!' Salomon told the Post.

Salomon also told the paper he's even had a run-in with the mob during the height of the Pizza Connection trial -- when two men speaking Italian and English hopped into his car, asking to be driven to the airport. He says the two men were very eager to hear the radio, describing the trial.

'It was then I realized where I had picked them up — Foley Square, the very place where all the courthouses were located,' Salomon told the Post. 'And they had gotten into my cab at 4 p.m., the time of day when a trial would be recessing. And they had told me that they make this trip to Chicago every Friday. They were going back home for the weekend until the trial picked up again the following Monday!'

'I knew at this moment as well as I could ever know that these guys sitting five feet behind me were card-carrying members of the mob,' he continued.

Salomon said that though the men only gave him a 10 percent tip, he wasn't going to fight it.

'What could I say besides, “Have a good flight"?'

Salomon also says he's seen many couples have sex in the backseat of his car...to the dismay of law enforcement
