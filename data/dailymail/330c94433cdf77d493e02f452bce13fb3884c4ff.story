Olympic hopeful Dina Asher-Smith insists it is unfair on the majority of athletes to suggest the sport is in crisis after a number of doping stories in recent months.

Claims of systematic drug use in Russia followed an eight-year ban for Tyson Gay's former coach Jon Drummond for doping violations in December.

But Asher-Smith, a sprinter with her targets set on Rio 2016, insists the suggestion there are major cracks appearing in the sport is disrespectful to those who are training and competing clean.

'(Doping) is disgusting, I have to work really, really hard,' the 19-year-old told BBC Sport.

'And I know all the British girls are working really hard, so to paint them with the same brush is quite unfair.

'It's unfair to all the athletes who work really hard to say the sport's in a crisis.'

World and European indoor 60 metres champion Richard Kilty admitted there was a 'shadow' hanging over the sport but felt the best way to combat that was to beat the cheats on the track.

'I race against convicted dopers at almost every Diamond League meeting or major championships and it's not nice or fair,' he said.

'But the best thing you can do is go out there and beat those guys, knowing you can have full pride in doing it clean.'
