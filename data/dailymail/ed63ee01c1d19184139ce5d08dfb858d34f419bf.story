A massive study of the Pacific Ocean floor shows it’s a huge underwater garbage dump.

On over 18,000 hours of footage from deep sea remotely operated vehicles, researchers at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) looked at seafloor as deep as 13,000 feet and found manmade trash items in every place they looked.

Deep sea vehicles viewed dive sites all along the West Coast from the Gulf of California to Vancouver Island and all around the Hawaiian Islands, with the worst accumulation of plastic, metal, fishing debris, and other trash in Monterey Canyon off the California coast.

Researchers found that Monterey Canyon, where MBARI
conducts 200 research dives per year, had more trash than anywhere else.

In the deep sea ravine off the coast of California alone,
the researchers noted over 1,150 pieces of debris on the seafloor.

Mapped: Everywhere the along the West Coast and Hawaiian Islands the seafloor is littered with plastic, metal, and various other man-made trash

Abysmal: The researchers were surprised to find that the deeper they went, the more trash they found. Even as deep down as 13,000 feet

Researchers did not find random spatterings of trash all
across the Pacific seafloor. Instead, they discovered that debris accumulates
in deep sea slopes and rocky areas.

There was more garbage found in deeper areas than in more
shallower spots.

‘I was surprised that we saw so much trash in deeper water.
We don't usually think of our daily activities as affecting life two miles deep
in the ocean.’ Said lead author of the study Kyra Schlining. ‘I'm sure that
there's a lot more debris in the canyon that we're not seeing. A lot of it gets
buried by underwater landslides and sediment movement. Some of it may also be
carried into deeper water, farther down the canyon.’

Most of the debris, about a third of it, is plastic. Because
there is no sunlight on the sea floor, these petroleum-based objects can take
hundreds of years to degrade.

And as they do, they often turn brittle and break into tiny
pieces. As this happens, it becomes more likely that tiny sea floor creatures
will consume the toxic substances.

This can harm the animal and introduce foreign substances
into the food chain.

Deep sea fishing: Fishing gear was also a common. Plastic was the most common type of object found

Paper or plastic: Metal was the second most common item type found. Of the plastic items, about half were plastic grocery bags

Of the plastic items, about half were plastic grocery bags.
These increasingly controversial items can choke and smother animals.

Los Angeles became the biggest city in the country to ban
free plastic bags in grocery stores following a city council vote this past Tuesday.

About $2 million a year is spent to clean up plastic bag
litter in Los Angeles. Sanitation authorities estimate more than 228,000 bags
are distributed in the city every hour.

But clearly many of the bags are ending up deep down on the
sea floor.

Metal objects were the second most common. Of them, about
two thirds were aluminum, steel, or tin cans.

Discarded fishing equipment was also commonly observed. As
were glass bottles, papers, and cloth.

Big: A huge shipping container containing a thousand tires was found. Researchers believe such large items could seriously disrupt deep sea ecosystems

Batteries included: In addition to choking and suffocating creatures, some trash can contaminate the deep sea with caustic chemicals

MBARI researchers hope to do additional research to
understand the long-term biological impacts of trash in the deep sea. Working
with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, they are currently finishing
up a detailed study of the effects of a particularly large piece of marine
debris—a shipping container that fell off a ship in 2004.

Inside the container are over 1,000 steel-belted tires.

Researchers believe such a large item, to which many
organisms have attached despite being in a habitat devoid of solid objects, can
seriously disrupt a deep sea ecosystem.

There is no way to cost-effectively remove the trash, so education
about preventing further accumulation is a major goal of the project.

For now, though—or at least up until now—the problem has
only worsened.

‘The most frustrating thing for me is that most of the
material we saw—glass, metal, paper, plastic—could be recycled,’ said Schlining.
‘Ultimately, preventing the introduction of litter into the marine environment
through increased public awareness remains the most efficient and
cost-effective solution to this dilemma.’
