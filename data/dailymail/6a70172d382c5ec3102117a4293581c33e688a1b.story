We’ve had treadmill desks and even human hamster wheels, each designed to stop us sitting for hours on end.

But the latest design, dubbed Dynamic Chair, turns the user’s whole body into a mouse so even when they’re sat down, they’re still moving.

Sensors built into the exoskeleton design recognise pressure and movements, which are then used to control an on-screen pointer.

The Dynamic Chair (pictured) was created by designer Govert Flint from Eindhoven University. Programmer Sami Sabik then translated these physical movements into on-screen ones. Sensors in the seat detect pressure, range of movements and angles and moving the hips, for example, scrolls through pages

The Dynamic Chair was created by designer Govert Flint from Eindhoven University, with help from programmer Sami Sabik.

It was designed and built for Mr Flint’s ‘Creatures with Creations’ research project.

‘Although our bodies are evolved to move, we tend to design objects based on monofunctional use and posture,’ explained Mr Flint.

Sensors in the seat detect pressure and the angle of the body, while accelerometers measure and track the movement of the user’s legs.

These movements are interpreted digitally, using software created by Mr Sabik, and are translated into movements on screen.

For example, moving the hips and lowering the body’s centre of gravity, for example, scrolls through pages and moves the mouse around the screen.

Kicking the left and right leg corresponds with left and right clicks, and in the future, arms could control swipe pages and open windows. 

‘Furthermore, as technology takes over more functions that formerly required exertion on our part, we are left with a less useful body.

‘We relegate our movements to leisure time.

'Movement becomes a choice and a lifestyle, segregated from our regular lives.

Kicking the left and right leg, when sat in Mr Flint's bionic chair (pictured) corresponds with left and right clicks on the screen. ‘Full body movement correlates with feelings of happiness,’ said Mr Flint. 'And yet, we spend days sitting behind a computer'

This vision is demonstrated in a video that accompanies the researcher project.

To master the type and range of movements, Mr Flint studied dancers at the Scapino Ballet Rotterdam.

‘Full body movement correlates with feelings of happiness,’ continued Mr Flint. ‘And yet, we spend days sitting behind a computer.’

To make this more dynamic, Mr Flint’s exoskeleton chair allows the body to move freely.

‘With this chair, our bodies are once again functional, stimulating regular movement. 

'After all, that’s what we were designed to do.’

The prototype chair doesn't register arm movements, because arms are typically used to type. But, in the future, Mr Flint imagines arm movements being used to swipe pages and open windows (demonstrated)
