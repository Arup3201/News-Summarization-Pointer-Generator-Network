The latest trend hitting this summer's festivals are musical Wellington boots.

The 'Bloom Boots' come with a built-in sound system that connects to any Bluetooth-enabled device and can play music wirelessly wherever you are.

The bright yellow wellies also feature a waterproof pocket in the right boot that keeps your phone safe and dry, and a larger pocket in the left boot to store other belongings and festival essentials such as money, tissues or a torch.

Created by mobile music service Bloom.fm, these bright yellow 'Bloom Boots' come with a built-in sound system that connects to any Bluetooth-enabled device and can play music wirelessly wherever you are

The rechargeable speakers can be used to play music stored on any connected device.

Users
can also access more than 18 million tracks from Bloom.fm's free iOS 
app, or listen to over 150 in-app radio stations, including new stations
featuring artists from the line-ups of each major UK festival.

Earlier this week Vodafone and the University of Southampton unveiled a new range of denim shorts that use body heat and movement to generate electricity.

The
Power Shorts can charge a phone's battery by 
harvesting energy from the human body using kinetic and thermoelectric 
technology.

The shorts are fitted with a phone connector and ferroelectret materials.

As the wearer moves, the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed.

As the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes, a charge is produced on the surface of the material.

The Bloom Boots come with a mini-USB cable that can be plugged into any computer or appropriate adapter to charge the speakers.

The speaker will then last for five hours on a single charge.

Oleg Fomenko, CEO and co-founder of 
Bloom.fm said: 'Bloom.fm was created specifically for your mobile, and 
our users take all their favourite music with them wherever they go.

'The summer festival season is the highpoint of the musical calendar.

We wanted to make it even better by letting friends enjoy their music together while hanging out at campsites or between bands.'

'UK music fans love festivals and certainly aren’t scared of a bit of rain and mud.

But with a pair of Bloom Boots they can make sure the music never stops and keep their phone and feet dry in style.'

The Bloom Boots are exclusively available from Firebox and cost £89.99.

Bloom.fm's app and radio streaming are both free without a subscription.

For £1 a month users can also borrow up to 20 songs at a time and then swap them for new tracks.
