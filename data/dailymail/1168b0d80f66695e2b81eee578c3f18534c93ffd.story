From the puritanical Victorian standards of beauty in 1910, to the eclectic styles of today, a fascinating new time-lapse video documents how hairstyles have changed over the past century.

The video, masterminded by the team at Cut Video, shows how beauty has evolved over 100 years in just one minute.

Beginning in 1910, the model showcases the elegant yet conservative curls seen on the Crawley women in Downton Abbey.

Then and now: Beginning in 1910 and finishing in 2010, a new video shows how hairstyles have evolved

The film swiftly moves through to 1920, also known as the Roaring Twenties, and depicts the popular bobbed haircut - a symbol of women's increasing freedom. 

The look was inspired by glamorous film stars such as  Louise Brooks, and make-up was worn heavy.

Next up is the 1930s and 1940s - eras that took cues from Hollywood starlets such as Bette Davis and Rita Hayworth. 

Curls were big news during these decades, which is reflected in the video, and it shows them loose, pinned and, above all, in abundance.

Glamorous: The 1950s were all about immaculate hair via beautifully curled bouffants, as seen in the video

The video then moves on to 1950s. Following the end of the Second World War, women became increasingly glamorous and immaculate.

They embraced traditional, conservative values of beauty and with it came beautifully curled bouffants, and the iconic 'doe eye' created with heavy eyeliner and bright lips.

The 1960s, as proven in the video, were all about the apologetically voluminous beehive.

The look was created in 1954 by Chicago-based hairdresser Margaret Vinci Heldt who was asked by the editors of a glossy magazine to conjure up a style to reflect the next decade - it became a sartorial hit.

Next up came the 1970s - and a social revolution. Indeed, hair reflected this and was worn long, flowing and free. Popularised by the likes of Farrah Fawcett, it was all about loose curls.

Thanks to the social revolution of the 1970s, hair was worn long, flowing and free a la Farrah Fawcett

As for 1980, as seen in the video, hair got bigger and bigger and women took inspiration from Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, who crimped their hair and wore it in a side ponytail. Make-up was colourful and clashing and hairspray was a girl's best friend. 

As the footage ventures into 1990, it's clear that Jennifer Aniston's character Rachel in Friends was hugely influential. Hair was long, sleek and framed the face; choppy layers were all the rage. So popular was this look that it was recently named the most iconic hairstyle ever.

The millennium hairstyle didn't change hugely and sleek hair was still big news.

The final look in the video is 2010 and showcases bouncy, loose curls reminiscent of Kim Kardashian - the model is even taking a selfie using her mobile phone.

Jordan from Hershesons said of the video: 'The time lapse shows a real move from hair that is contrived;  you need an arsenal of products and tools for hair that is stiff and untouchable.

'Nowadays, hair has gone on a journey to be more organic, natural. Far more ‘get up and go’ achievable beauty, hair you want to run your hands through.

'The most popular requests we get are for ‘undone’ styles. People want ‘Cool Girl’ hair that looks a little bit naughty.'

Wacky: In 1980 hair got bigger and bigger and women took inspiration from Madonna and Cyndi Lauper

Sleek and chic: The 1990s and 2000 were fairly bland in terms of hair experimentation. Women wore their locks sleek and choppy layers were favoured

Selfie nation: Hair as we know it today is worn effortlessly curled and the final shot in the video, right, is perhaps a nod to selfie-obsessed celebrities of today such as Kim Kardashian 

nice’n easy colour Advisor Jonathan Long comments on the hair colour trends through the decades:

1930s:

“In the 1930’s with the already vibrant Art Noveau, and the more recent Art Deco trends spreading across Europe and America, hair became more graphic and bold. The look was short, jaw length hair, with strong shape. Long hair tended to be pin curled at the front to resemble jaw length hair and kept small and tight in a chignon style at the back. Colours were bold, single applications of primary colours; the purest tone. If it was blonde it was the cleanest, purest platinum possible and if it was dark it was deep and strong to give strength and density to the shape.”

1940s:

“In the 1940’s, even in the midst of war with clothing and fabric rationing, people took great pride in their hair. The updos of the 30’s continued but hair naturally became longer and darker giving way to beautiful deep rich dark tones which would be set on pin curls then brushed through to create that classic wave of the 40’s. Raven haired beauties like style icon Ava Gardener epitomised the 40’s and took the lime light with beautiful blondes like Veronica Lake becoming more rarely seen on screen.”

1950s:

“With the constraints of war at an end, glamour became popular and women wanted to create a hair look that implied ‘domestic goddess’. Women looked to the glamour of Marilyn Monroe and the decade's other big Hollywood screen vamps and sirens for inspiration. Intense red coloured lips and platinum blonde hair became popular, highlighting a pale complexion.”

1960s:

“Women were moving into the workplace and wanted a more manageable and achievable day-time look. Hair colour was kept simple, with the emphasis on natural, healthy-looking colour like nice’n easy Sunkissed. Blonde was still the key colour but a more natural darker blonde with highlights, made famous by Ursula Andress and Bridget Bardot. Darker hair was often given highlights and the sun-kissed look by soaking strands of hair in lemon juice and sitting in the sun.”

1970s:

“At the beginning of the 1970’s a dark natural blonde look remained popular, inspired by Farrah Fawcett from the cult series 'Charlies Angels'. Hair was all about manes of free-falling curls, soft partings and long fringes completed by bronzed skin. However by the end of the era with the 'Punk' movement, women like Toyah Wilcox started to experiment with hair colour. For the first time we saw vivid primary or fluorescent hair colours emerging.”

1980s:

“Women were opting for intense strong colour to compliment 'power dressing'. Rich brunettes and strong blondes were all the rage, inspired by Dynasty characters' Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis (Joan Collins). On the other hand, the rebellious streak that started with punk continued with women led by Madonna wanting an ever-changing hair colour to go with their unconventional, eccentric clothing.”

1990s and 2000s:

“During the 1990’s and naughties, the whole world went back to blonde all over again! Each season we see the emergence of new hair colour trends, but our love of blondes remains constant throughout. Multi-toned inspired highlights, which can be achieved at home with nice’n easy Sunkissed, or an all over blonde – any shade of blonde in fact, even previously brunette models and film stars turned blonde.”

2010s:

“With all of the resources available to us today in the 2010s, blonde is still the desired hair colour of choice. The blondes of today are much easier going and less high maintenance. Multi-tonal, sun kissed, sandy blondes have replaced the all over block colours of previous years, allowing for that organic look and feel. We are entering into an era of huge change in hair colour and the way that people perceive hair colour. In the 2010s it should be a part of you not something extra added. With the likes of Scarlett Johansson opting to 'dress it down' instead of 'up' with her tousled sandy, sun kissed locks at this year’s Oscars showing her real natural beauty, you can definitely see the change we are heading for!”
