The woman who police say viciously attacked a New Jersey mother in front of her two-year-old son has turned herself into authorities.

Latia Harris, 25, surrendered to police on Monday night in relation to last week's brutal that was captured on video.

Authorities say they were 'close to capturing' the fugitive over the weekend in Philadelphia.

Surrendered: Latia Harris, a South Jersey woman who police say attacked a mother in a field in Salem County turned herself in on Monday evening. Harris had been eluding capture for six days

Caught: According to New Jersey State Police, the attorney for Latia Harris called them on Monday saying Harris would surrender within an hour

Harris faces two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.

The 4'9" tall, 100 pound Ferreira says the attack left her with a broken nose and a mild concussion.

Police say Harris is the attacker seen in the video wearing a red McDonald's uniform.

The fight began because investigators believe Harris thought Ferreira, a one-time coworker, had spread rumors about a romantic relationship between Harris and a work supervisor.

Horrifying aftermath: Catherine Ferreira, 27, suffered a broken nose, two
 black eyes and a mild concussion, but she said she could have been dead
 had her assailant struck her in the right spot

Team effort: Salem City Police Department partnered with the New Jersey State Police Fugitive Unit and the United States Marshall¿s New Jersey/New York Regional Fugitive Task-force in an effort to locate Harris

Bystanders: The attack was even more shocking given that many people simply stood around and videoed the fight with their cellphones instead of trying to prevent it from escalating

Harris thought the revelations could jeopardize her job.

On the video the Harris is seen kicking Ferreira while she is laying on the ground and spitting at her.

Police managed to obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. 

The
 graphic footage showed the McDonald's employee pounding Ferreira and being punched and kick her at least 20 times.

Incredibly, Ferreira's two-year-old son was in the middle of it all, trying to intervene by kicking and screaming at Harris.

‘Mommy!’ the little boy cried out.

You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams.

The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on Ferreira lying bleeding on the ground.

Before
 she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not 
over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.'  

Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood. 

They found the 27-year-old bleeding 
profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was 
taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face.

What has caused uproar is that fact several people witnessed the attack but did nothing except record it on their cell phones.

The video of the brutal beating went 
viral, yet none of the bystanders 
seen in the footage came to Ferreira’s aid as she was being brutalized 
by the much larger woman.

Little hero: Ferreira said her sole protector during the beating was her 2-year-old son, Xzavion, who threw himself on Latia Harris

Caught: Latia Harris, 25, is in jail and now facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats

'[It's outrageous] that it occurred 
in front of a 2-year-old and because people didn't intervene. The video 
is clear, you can see people not looking at the fight itself but looking
 at their camera looking at the fight,' said Chief John Pelura, Salem Police.

Meanwhile, Jim Burlaga, the owner and operators of the McDonald's where Harris worked, released the following statement:

'I
 am aware of the incident involving one of my employees earlier this 
week. I am extremely disturbed by this kind of behavior and it goes 
against the values and standards that I expect from my employees in my 
restaurants. This employee will 
not be serving customers pending this important police investigation and
 I'm fully cooperating with the local police in this matter.'

Harris has not shown up for work following the incident.

Last week, just days after the assault, Ms Ferreira said she was shocked that no one besides her toddler came to her rescue.

Appearing before the cameras last Friday she could be seen with a badly swollen face and two black eyes.

The video shows her being thrown to the ground like a rag doll and repeatedly being punched in the face.

'I think it’s messed up no one came to my rescue,' Ferreira told NBC Philadelphia.

The only person to intervene on behalf of the woman was her 2-year-old, Xzavion Ortiz.

‘I became so much closer to my son 
because he didn't care what was going on,’ she said. ‘He wasn't afraid. 
He just wanted to defend his mom.’

Idle gossip: Ferreira (left) said her feud with Harris (right) started a couple of weeks ago when she dropped by the McDonald's where she once worked to chat with her friends and mentioned that Harris had a relationship with a manager

Different persona: Harris also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur

Family matters: The 25-year-old has two young children (pictured) and a large family in Philadelphia

Ms Ferreira explained to NJ.com that she used to work at the same Salem McDonald’s as Harris.

Two
 or three weeks ago, she stopped by the eatery to chat with some of her 
former colleagues, and at one point Ferreira made an off-hand remark 
about Latia Harris' alleged romantic relationship with her supervisor.

According to Ferreira, the 25-year-old
 overheard her comment and became upset. In the weeks that followed, 
Harris kept calling her and saying that she could get fired over the bit
 of gossip. 

Last Tuesday, 
Ferreira said she was walking home with her son at around 7pm when 
Harris ambushed her in a clearing behind the McDonald’s and smacked her.

Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem

Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times

'Monstrous': The victim's son tried to intervene by repeatedly kicking her attacker in the legs until Harris threatened to kick the 2-year-old in the face (right)

No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her

The 4-foot-9, 10-pound 
mother tried to reason with Harris and informed her that she did not 
want to fight, but the woman ignored her pleas, hurling Ferreira' to the
 ground.

‘I could have been
 dead right now, had she hit me in the right spot it would have been 
over, over nothing,’ Ferreira tearfully said. ‘McDonald’s isn’t worth 
it, a guy isn’t worth it.’

The
 people who witnessed the attack and did nothing to stop it have been 
condemned by local police and the media, but Ferreira cautioned against 
demonizing them, stressing in the interview that they should not be seen
 as ‘monsters.’

At the time, when speaking of her attacker, Ferreira broke down
 in tears, saying she felt sorry for her because the woman has two 
children.
