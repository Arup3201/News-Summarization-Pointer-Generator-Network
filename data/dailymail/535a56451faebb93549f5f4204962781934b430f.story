Bizarre CCTV footage has emerged of a horseman riding into a train station in Berkshire and racially abusing a staff member.

Detectives today launched a manhunt to find the man who brazenly rode into Windsor and Eton Riverside Station with a riding crop - and threatened to whip an employee.

During the incident on January 4, bemused staff confronted the culprit as he trotted into the booking hall at the station in Berkshire - a short distance from Windsor Palace.

The incident turned nasty when the rider racially abused one of the staff members on duty and threatened to whip them.

Police rushed to the station after the shocked station employee raised the alarm but the rider had already fled by the time they arrived.

Detective Constable Rod Harbron who is leading the investigation said the man - who wore a black jacket and blue jeans - arrived at around 3pm and made his way towards the platforms. 

He added: 'When challenged by a member of station staff, he racially abused them and threatened to assault them with a riding crop.' 

'A busy railway station is no place for horses and rail operators have every right to refuse access to people with animals under the railway bylaws.

'The member of staff was just doing their job and racial abuse and threats will not be tolerated. Who is the man on the pony? If you recognise him, please get in touch.'

A spokesman for the South West Trains - Network Rail Alliance - said the abusive and threatening behaviour towards its staff will not be tolerated.

'We will not tolerate this type of behaviour against our staff and will work with British Transport Police to identify those responsible,' he added.
