Samuel Eto'o has completed his move from Everton to Sampdoria, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal.

The 33-year-old striker joined the Toffees on a free transfer in August and leaves after scoring four goals in 20 appearances. 

Everton boss Roberto Martinez told the club website: 'We thank Samuel for his efforts and for bringing his know-how to the team and to (Everton's training ground) Finch Farm, where he passed on some of his terrific experience to all of the young players in particular.

'The memory of his performances in Europe stand out especially. On behalf of all Evertonians, we wish him well for the next chapter in his career.'

It was reported last week that Eto'o had already agreed a contract with the Serie A side, accepting a 40 per cent pay cut, but the deal stalled, with Sampdoria complaining about a lack of clarity in their dealings with Everton.

On Saturday, the Genoa club published a picture of the four-time African Footballer of the Year in their colours and Everton confirmed on Tuesday that Eto'o has returned to Italy on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

The former Cameroon international spent two years with Inter Milan between 2009 and 2011 before moving on to Anzhi Makhachkala and then Chelsea.

Following his release by the Blues at the end of last season, Eto'o opted to stay in the Premier League and declared on his arrival at Goodison Park: "I am here for two years and hope to be here for a lot more."

Eto'o scored in his first game for Everton against Chelsea and also netted against Krasnodar in the Europa League as well as scoring a brace in a 3-1 victory over Burnley.

But he was in and out of the side as Martinez's team struggled for form and made his last appearance as a substitute in the 1-1 FA Cup draw with West Ham on January 6.

Sampdoria were looking to strengthen their forward line after selling top scorer Manolo Gabbiadini to Napoli earlier this month.

The Genoa outfit, coached by Sinisa Mihajlovic, are fifth in Serie A, level on 34 points with fourth-placed Lazio and two points adrift of Napoli.
