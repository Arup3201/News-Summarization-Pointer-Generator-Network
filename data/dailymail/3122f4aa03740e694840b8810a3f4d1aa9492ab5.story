Manchester City’s stars will become the first players in the Barclays Premier League to sleep at their own new training ground before games.

Manuel Pellegrini’s squad moved across town this week in to their new £200m training base opposite the Etihad Stadium.

Now it has emerged that the first team will effectively use the ‘Etihad Campus’ as a hotel the night before home games, eating and sleeping there before making their way across the road to the stadium.

Usually Premier League clubs stay in hotels before games, enabling managers to hold team meetings and ensure players eat and rest correctly.

City have always used the Hilton on Manchester’s Deansgate but their players will now effectively have their own bedrooms at the training ground. Pellegrini will also expect his players to head back there after afternoon games for a meal and recuperation.

It is understood that the players will not use the centre on Friday night ahead of Saturday’s game against Tottenham as only a third of the new training ground is fully operational. This means they could well use it for the first time ahead of the Manchester derby on November 2.

City’s Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira said: 'The first team will be able to stay there on the night before a home game, instead of going to a hotel.

'I think it’s an advantage to stay.

'When I played in Italy we had a place to stay after training.

'Normally, after training you want to go straight home so you don’t end up stuck in traffic, but here you can stay and have a treatment, and leave much later. It is more professional.'

City are not the first team to have sleeping facilities at their training ground. Neighbours United, for example, installed rooms last year.

However, they are the first club to effectively be able to use their own base as a hotel the night before matches.
