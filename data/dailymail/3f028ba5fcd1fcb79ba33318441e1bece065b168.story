Harry Redknapp has revealed he was attacked with coins and verbally abused by Arsenal fans as he left the Emirates Stadium after the Gunners' 4-1 win over Liverpool.

Currently out of work after leaving his position at Queens Park Rangers, the former Tottenham boss was at the Emirates as a spectator on April 4 when some fans turned against him.

Redknapp claims he had earlier signed autographs and posed for pictures with friendly supporters, but when he was stuck in traffic after the game, a group of supporters began abusing him.

Speaking on Sky Sports' The Fantasy Football Club, Redknapp said: 'I went to Arsenal and to be honest with you they were fantastic. 

'The people you meet, everyone, I signed autographs and spoke with everybody. I come out and had a couple of pictures in my car with the lads who come over - they were Arsenal fans.

'Suddenly about 15 blokes outside of a pub there go off and I'm stuck in the traffic. They see me and bang, (they start) throwing coins and giving me abuse.

'You know, it's unreal. It's always the small minority so they can spoil it for the rest and that for me is a big problem.'

The 68-year-old, who was speaking to former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson, admitted that abusive fans is the least enjoyable thing as a manager. 

'A lot of it is not good abuse and a lot of it is personal abuse, it’s filth,' Redknapp continued. 'I see people there with their grandkids saying the most horrific things - it’s scary really.

'Most punters are fantastic and it’s a lovely game I’ve been brought up with.'
