Everton have left for their 4,800-mile round trip to face Russian side Krasnodar in the Europa League without defender Seamus Coleman.

Right-back Coleman, who has missed Everton’s last three matches with a hamstring injury, was not on the plane that left Liverpool John Lennon Airport on Wednesday morning with manager Roberto Martinez also thinking about Sunday’s Premier League clash against Manchester United.

His Irish international team-mate James McCarthy also did not make the trip in an otherwise strong squad.

Everton are currently 15th in the Premier League but beat Wolfsburg 4-1 in their opening Europa League tie a fortnight ago.

If goalkeeper Tim Howard faces Krasnodar on Thursday he will become the club’s record appearance maker in Europe.

Sylvan Distin, who has not played since the 3-0 League Cup defeat at Swansea, and midfielder Steven Pienaar who collected a groin injury at the end of August were also left behind on Merseyside.

But there were places in the squad for senior stars Leighton Baines, Gareth Barry, Howard and captain Phil Jagielka, youngsters Luke Garbutt and Tyas Browning, understudy keeper Joel Robles and multiple Champions League winner Samuel Eto’o.
