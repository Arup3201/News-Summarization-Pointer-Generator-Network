A shocking audio recording of what is claimed to be the moment a wounded Afghan fighter was shot by a Royal Marine has been released by a military court.

The shot can be clearly heard – followed by the veteran sergeant saying: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil.’

A few seconds later he can be heard ordering his comrades: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I’ve just broken the Geneva Convention.’

In the recording of the incident one soldier says: 'I'll put one in his head if you want' before a single gun shot can be heard, followed by groans from the insurgent, an unknown Afghan national.

Scroll down for audio

Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine allegedly shows the moment three men helped 'execute' an insurgent in Afghanistan, a court heard

Accusations: Three marines, known only as Marines A, B and C have been charged with murdering the man, who was lying in a field seriously injured after an Apache helicopter attack

Clip: A single gun shot can be heard, followed by groans from the insurgent, an unknown Afghan national who died

'Shuffle off this mortal coil you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us'

Three marines, known only as Marines 
A, B and C have been charged with murdering the man, who was lying in a 
field seriously injured after an Apache helicopter attack.

They claim he was already dead when a shot was fired into his chest.

A panel at a court martial in 
Bulford, Wiltshire, today retired to consider their verdicts in the 
case, after two weeks of evidence, but will now resume its deliberations
tomorrow after reaching no verdict.

Audio: In a recording of the incident a soldier is heard saying 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us' after the shot is fired into his chest

Case: The prosecution says a single gun shot was fired into the victim's chest at this spot, and three men are currently on trial

Footage: The recording hears the group dragging the man's injured body with the marines apparently joking about refusing to give first aid

Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett has ruled graphic video footage - from which the audio was taken - must not be released.

Key:M/marine: unidentified speaker?Marine B: lower confidence in attribution(Lower level confidence in words transcribed)... Unintelligible speech

End of recording. Next video:

'Its
release may be for proper journalistic purposes... but would also be 
used for sensationalist purposes by others and propaganda purposes by 
terrorist groups,' he said.

'More importantly its release will increase the threat of harm to British service personnel.

'I am not prepared to make an order which
may lead to the injury or death of a single member of the British armed
forces and in making this decision I have erred on the side of safety. 

However, Judge Blackett permitted the 
release of certain still images from the video, which was captured on a 
camera worn by Marine B.

The video footage shows the Royal 
Marine patrol stood waiting outside a field of tall crops, with an 
Apache helicopter audible overhead.

Servicemen
can be heard swearing and complaining about their task of carrying out a
'battle damage assessment' after the Apache helicopter attack.

During
the trial, court martial heard the insurgent had been shot at with 139 
30mm anti-tank rounds but was still alive - albeit seriously injured - 
when discovered by the patrol.

One
commando can be heard asking: 'Why didn't they use a f***ing rocket?', 
another replies 'F*** me, it's just error after error after error.'

Marines A and C are seen scouting out the field, locating the Afghan before calling the others over.

As Marine B walks towards them, the 
camera captures its first shot of the seriously injured insurgent - 
lying on the ground, wearing a white dish-dash and covered in blood.

The
patrol drags the man across the field and into a wooded area nearby, 
throwing him to the ground. Marine A is heard asking 'Anybody want to do
first aid on this idiot?'.

Marine
B is heard to loudly reply 'no'. Marine C offers to shoot the man in 
the head, which is refused as Marine A rules 'that would be f****** 
obvious'.

The injured man, whose shirt had been 
pulled up his bloodied back, suffers kicks from the servicemen, who then
flip him from back to front.

Marine A is seen walking forward, 
bending down, and shooting the man at close range in the centre of his 
chest with a 9mm pistol.

Giving
evidence to the court martial, Marine A insisted he believed the 
insurgent was dead at the time and he was simply shooting into a corpse 
in anger.

After shooting
the man, Marine A is seen turning to the other members of the patrol 
and telling them 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas.

'I just broke the Geneva Convention.'

On the way back down to the CP, it came over the Coy net that 2 more men they'd tracked were up at compound 46 W5S, just West of us, and were about to get smashed by the AH.

We went firm to watch/wait to see if we were needed and waited...

When the strike when in it was sound, AH let loose with 30mm and the geezer got smashed.

As he'd been heading East at the time, across a field, we got tasked to carry out the BDA - since we were only around 500m away.

So we headed up there, and as soon as we crossed into the field he was in, behind compound 13, I pinged him.

White dish dash, 50 meters North of the tree line we were moving up, in the middle of the field. 

**** was still moving!

138 30mm rounds hadn't finished him off.

I expected him to be in bits!

So we drew level with him and went firm, then me and Marine A moved out to him, covering each other a bound at a time, as the others provided our protection.

He was down and hanging out but still moving, I said as much to Marine A, as well as I had a headshot, but we cracked on up to him - I'd expected to brass him up there and then, but I followed Marine A's lead.

We got to him, and he was in a very bad way, first we did the standard checks, Marine A searched... him, then jumped on him and rolled him over to check under him for any nasties.

PGSS had us in full view, as did AH so Marine A was playing it straight.

We recovered an old hanging out AK, with 2 mags, as well as a HE Grenade - sneaky ****.

Next he started assessing his wound, while I had my pistol drawn on his head in case he tried anything; any excuse to pop him I would, piece of ****.

I wanted to slot him bad, but Marine A said no due to the PGSS feed - goes direct live back to Bastion, could wind me up on a Murder charge.

As I said before, he was ****** up though his brain just hadn't caught up with his body - he was dead, but he just didn't know it yet.

The HE/Incendiary rounds the AH use has fragged up his entire left side, head to toe, and he has 2 or 3 nasty ones up his back - having sucking chest wounds you could have fit 3 fingers in - his lungs and **** hanging out.

I felt no pity for him though, **** had just been shooting up our boys at TALANDER and god knows what before that.

So once we'd searched and de-armed him, a couple of lads came over to drag him out of the middle of the fields, as we were mega exposed, and into the treeline... everyone else was firm in.

This also meant we were out of the watchful eye of the PGSS balloon.

Initially Marine A had sent up that this worthless piece of **** was alive, rightly or wrongly, but wasn't keen to call a MERT out; he was nearly dead anyway, don't think he'd of pulled through.

Now we were in cover, I was ready and waiting to pop him with a 9mm, one in the heart should do it, but I waited out for the nod from Marine A, kept pressing the point and although for one minute I thought we were actually going to treat and casivac him, Marine A squashed it and sent it up that he'd snuffed it while we treated him.

So there I was, pistol drawn, waiting for Marine A to get off the net so I could pop this little **** and be done with it; when Marine A came back over, and thinned me out, to take up arcs with the others.

As I walked off towards **** ****, Marine A popped him one himself! I felt mugged off, but job done, little **** was dead at the end of the day.

We got some DNA off him, then headed back in. I was pretty threaders; not because I hadn't got to finish him off myself, as he was dead either way, and I'd have gained nothing from it, although I wanted to, maybe just for self satisfaction.

I just felt a little mugged off.

Still end result was a good one = 1 x dead Taliban **** bag, 1 x AK, 2 x Mags and 1 x Grenade off the streets. Result: NEMESIS x1.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
