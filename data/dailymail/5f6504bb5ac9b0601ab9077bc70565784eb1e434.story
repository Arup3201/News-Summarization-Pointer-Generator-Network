A baby born without an immune system is trialling a world-first gene therapy cure to ‘re-boot’ her body’s defence systems and give her the chance of life outside a sterilised environment.

Seventeen-month-old Nina Warnell suffers from Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome (SCID) - an inherited condition known as ‘bubble baby’ syndrome - which affects just one in 300,000 babies.

She has all the appearance of a healthy child but her body is unable to fight even the mildest germs - meaning even a cough or sneeze could kill her.

Nina Warnell, 17-months-old, was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome which means her body is unable to fight germs

The radical new treatment - devised by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital - has its risks but Nina’s parents Graeme and Aga Warnell, from Maidenhead, have been left with few choices.

‘With Nina’s condition, you’re against a ticking clock,’ said Mr Warnell, 43, a real estate project manager.

‘If you don’t do anything within the year, the chances of recovery and survival are very limited.

‘It’s very rare that a child survives beyond two if nothing is done.’

Nina was diagnosed in March 2012 after her mother became concerned that she was sleeping too much and not feeding properly.

At five-weeks-old she was admitted to hospital where doctors discovered that she had multiple infections including advanced pneumonia.

The treatment works by re-engineering Nina's bone marrow to add a vital missing gene. Doctors hope that this will allow her body to create its own immune system

She was placed in isolation to stop her coming into contact with any more disease and the infections were tackled with a cocktail of antibiotics and anti-viral drugs.

The family had to scrub down and wear masks and gowns before being allowed through an airlock-type room to see their critically ill daughter.

Things then went from bad to worse as doctors told them Nina needed an urgent bone marrow transplant for any chance of survival.

Both her sisters and parents did not match and so Mr and Mrs Warnell campaigned for the public to register as donors with the Anthony Nolan Trust and equivalent charities abroad.

Nina (pictured moments after her birth) was believed to be a healthy baby until her mother noticed that she was sleeping a lot and not feeding well. She was admitted to hospital at five-weeks-old

Tests revealed that she was suffering from numerous infections. She was diagnosed with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome and put on the bone marrow donor list but no match could be found

But with Nina getting worse by the day the family decided to move her to Great Ormond Street.

Over the following months she slowly started to recover and finally put on weight and doctors managed to create an ‘artificial’ immune system for her.

She has to take 15 medications a day and immunoglobulin transfusions every three weeks to maintain it - but it is still very weak.

At this point, Professor Bobby Gaspar, a consultant in paediatric immunology, approached the family about the possibility of gene therapy - and things are now starting to look brighter.

A team led by the professor is in the process of trialling a new form of gene therapy on the youngster.

Nina was getting sicker by the day waiting for a transplant so her parents moved her to Great Ormond Street Hospital for pioneering treatment

Doctors used an extensive drug regime to create an 'artificial immune system' for her but she is still very weak

Nina is missing a gene which produces an enzyme vital to the production of a healthy immune system.

The doctors have harvested her bone marrow and have re-engineered it using a new type of ‘reprogrammed virus’ to splice the vital gene she is missing into her DNA profile.

The re-engineered bone marrow has been re-inserted into her body and they hope a fully functioning immune system will develop.

Doctors estimate a 60 to 90 per cent chance of success.

Professor Gaspar told MailOnline that he hopes this form of gene therapy will be able to help many other children as well, and that it could eventually replace bone marrow transplants as the main form of treatment for children with immunodeficiency.

As part of the treatment, Nina underwent a session of chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow so that the new one can grow in its place.

They are trying a new treatment which involves harvesting some of her bone marrow and re-engineering it to include a vital gene that she was missing. They hope this will allow her body to create its own immune system

She has suffered sickness and lost some of her light-blonde hair in the process.

She also had to be housed in a sterilised room during treatment to minimise the risk of catching a potentially fatal disease.

SCID is a genetic disorder which results in a poor antibody response to germs.

It is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiency and can be caused by any one of nine different gene mutations.

It is also known as the bubble boy disease because one patient, David Vetter, became famous for spending 12 years living in a sterile bubble.

Patients are usually affected by severe infections early in their life - these can include pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections.

If left untreated, the babies usually die within one year.

The most common treatment is a bone marrow transplant.

There were several scares after she contracted a virus and the bone marrow became contaminated with bacteria when it was inserted into her body.

However, Mr Warnell said that in ‘true Nina style’ she fought them off and her cell count started to move slowly in the right direction.

As this is a pioneering treatment, 
the long-term outlook for Nina is unclear and it could be months, years 
or even decades for side effects to surface.

Nina
 returned home last month but the family will not know if her body has 
started producing its own immune system until Christmas.

If the gene therapy treatment is found to be unsuccessful, Nina will require a bone marrow transplant.

Although
 a potential match has been found - this is not the preferred option as 
Nina would require more aggressive chemotherapy and face the risk that 
her body will reject the donor marrow.

Mr
 Warnell, who has another daughter, Megan, 11, from a previous marriage,
 said: ‘When I look back at the last year of what we’ve been through and
 what’s happened to our family, it’s very hard to describe.

‘I
 can only really summarise it as like playing a record and someone just 
grabs the needle and pulls it straight off with a horrendous scratch and
 then there’s just silence.’

Nina (pictured with her sister, Mia, three) also had chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow and allow the new marrow to grow. Doctors believe there is a 60 to 90 per cent chance the treatment will be a success

However, they have been buoyed by Nina’s ‘fighting spirit’ which has seen her battle through several close scrapes.

He
 added: ‘Nina has maintained this internal resilience, which has baffled
 some of the doctors, where by, she has fought through all of these 
things whilst having no real immune system.

‘There is no medical answer why, she just has a very strong constitution which has enabled her to survive.

‘She’s
 now, in a very strange way, a very confident baby, in that she’s so 
used to being examined by doctors and people looking at her, people 
prodding, poking her, injecting her, that she’s almost a child that 
welcomes any form of human interaction in the hospital, especially as 
when at home she’s quite isolated.’

Since
 Nina left hospital, the family have had to turn their house into a 
quarantine zone and must screen everyone, and everything, that enters 
the house.

Nina has now been allowed home but her parents will not know whether the treatment has worked until Christmas. They have to disinfect everything (pictured) to ensure she is not exposed to germs

Mrs Warnell, 39, said: ‘We sterilise probably three to four times a day and then anything that drops on the floor has to be washed and sterilised again.

‘There’s also obsessive hand-washing. This is a house of compulsive hand-washers, but it has worked, it has really prevented any infections.’

The barriers they have had to impose on Nina has been particularly hard on the couple’s other daughter Mia, three.

She has to have limited contact with other children because of the risk of picking up a cold.

Mr Warnell said he often sees her staring longingly out of the window at the other kids playing outside.
