A postcard has finally been delivered to its rightful recipient - almost half a century after it was first posted.

Jason and Anna Crabtree were astonished when the letter - originally sent from Germany - fell on their doorstep in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

The postcard was sent from Bad Godesberg near Bonn and was posted on March 13, 1963.

Talk about late post, this card took 49 years to arrive from Germany, but its rightful recipient Derek Lewis is grateful he finally got it

Now, after putting out an appeal, the couple have tracked down the rightful recipient, Derek Lewis, 71, a retired grandfather who used to live in their house.

Mr Crabtree, 37, said: 'We were surprised that the original stamp was intact and it was in such good condition.

'We thought it was pretty funny that the Royal Mail decided to deliver it and that there wasn’t even a note on it.

'We are also wondering where it could have been all these years. It would be quite interesting if we could track its very long journey.'

Despite its long and delayed journey, the card is in good condition, with the stamp still intact. Intended recipient Derek Lewis points out that postcodes weren't in general use at the time

A delighted Mr Lewis said the card had come from an old pen pal, Gudrun Rentrope, who he’d been writing to since he was 17.

Gudrun had sent the postcard as a thank you after Mr Lewis had looked after her father during a visit to England.

Dear Derek,

First thank you very much for the presents, which you have given to my father and thank you that you met my father.

Today I am with my class in Bad Godesberg and Rhondorf. There lives our chancellor.

It is a wonderful day. I hope that next week I have a little more time to write you. Best wishes and once more thanks.

Yours Gudrun

But the card never turned up and Mr Lewis, a retired finance worker, said it was then that the pair lost touch.

Mr Lewis, who also lives in Maidenhead, said he was ‘totally surprised’ when it finally reached him 49 years after it was posted.

'The postcard thanked me for looking after her dad and passing on gifts. She was a very dear friend. It was quite a pleasant time in my life.

'In those days people didn’t have postcodes and I think this could have been one of the reasons it went missing. I can’t imagine how it got back into the system again.'

The card was stamped by Royal Mail in Swindon on Monday, October 29, 2012.

The Royal Mail has dismissed the possibility that it had gone missing in their system and suggested it must have been put in a postbox recently.

Spokesman Candice MacDonald said: 'It is extremely unlikely that this item of mail was in our system all this time.

'It is difficult to speculate what may have happened, but almost certainly it was put back in a postbox very recently, as we regularly check all our sorting offices and machines are cleared.'

A letter posted in Burnham-On-Crouh, Essex in 1929, finally arrived in East Dulwich, London, 79 years later.

Tracy Smeathers had to wait 9,964 days for her college certificates to 
arrive. She completed her course in 1982 but her papers were posted in 
February 2010.

A letter sent by a British soldier during World War Two arrived at its 
destination over 64 years late.The hand-written note was posted by 
Serviceman Charles Fleming to a woman identified only as 'my dearest', 
on March 20 1945. It was finally delivered by the Royal Mail to RAF 
Lakenheath in 2009.
