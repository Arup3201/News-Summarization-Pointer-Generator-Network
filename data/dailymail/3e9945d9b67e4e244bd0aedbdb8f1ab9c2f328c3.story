BBC Sport's determination to retain their coverage of the Six Nations has been significantly helped by their record-breaking viewing figures for the tournament and the positive feedback from the organisers.

A peak of 9.63million watched England beat France and go agonisingly close to clinching the title after 4.1m had tuned into the Italy-Wales game followed by a 5.1m audience for Ireland-Scotland as the audience built hugely during one of rugby’s greatest days.

The BBC website also had its best ever figures, with 8.22m searching for the Six Nations last Saturday.

The Beeb value the Six Nations along with Match of the Day and Wimbledon as their three most precious annual sporting properties and the viewing success of this year’s tournament was even more important, with the Six Nations preparing to talk to subscription channels for the next rights deal from 2018.

But the Six Nations are known to be delighted with the coverage of their competition by the Beeb across all regions and outlets.

And there is the opportunity for more of the same over the next two years. The 2016 fixture list sees the last game in Paris between France and England starting at 8pm, while the 2017 climax will be Ireland v England in Dublin at 5pm.
