Kimberly-Clark Corporation is being sued for $500million by a Southern California law firm that claims the its surgical gowns do not protect against Ebola.

The suit claims Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex among other personal care products, misrepresented the protection provided by surgical gowns manufactured by its healthcare brand. 

Law firm Eagan Avenatti said it filed the class-action lawsuit Wednesday, stating that the company's MICROCOOL Breathable High Performance Surgical
Gowns failed industry tests and did not meet certain standards.

Unprotected?: A lawsuit claims that wearers of Kimberly-Clark's surgical gowns are not fully protected from the Ebola virus

Attorneys claim the company misled regulators and workers and placed them at 'considerable risk,' as the gowns are not completely watertight and could allow wearer to contract the virus.

'Kimberly-Clark needs to immediately recall these gowns and
come clean with the FDA, CDC, healthcare professionals and the
general public,' said lead attorney Michael Avenatti in a
statement.

The firm says that the lawsuit is being brought on behalf of lead plaintiff Dr Hrayr Shahinian and 500,000 others.

'We anticipate seeking over $500 million, which represents at a minimum the amount of revenue that KMB has received from the sales of these gowns,' added Avanatti.

The gown was first introduced in 2011 and since then Kimberly-Clark has sold millions of units, according to the suit. 

The Ebola crisis in Africa, combined with the first diagnosis in the United States, has increased demand for protective garments, Judson Boothe, Kimberly-Clark Health Care's senior global manufacturing director told ABC earlier this month.

Impervious: The company claims on its website that its gowns are 'impervious' and the lawsuit states Kimberly-Clark has represented the products as being suitable for protecting against Ebola

The MICROCOOL gowns are produced under the Kimberly-Clark Healthcare brand, which is in the midst of being spun off into its own company.

Stocks for the new company, which will be called Halyard Health, will go on sale starting on Monday.

The company did not comment on the litigation, though its shares did not seem affected by the news.
