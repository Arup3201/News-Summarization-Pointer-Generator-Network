An Australian family have sprinkled the ashes of their triple jumper father on the athletics track at the Olympic Park, 64 years after he won silver at the 1948 London Games.

George Avery, born in 1925, 
attended the 
Olympics in 2000, and told his daughters that 
he would like return to the site of his Olympics glory if the Games came to London.

He died before he could make the trip so his daughter Robyn Glynn decided to sprinkle his ashes on the athletics track in Stratford, East London.

Legacy: The Olympic Torch is presented at the 1948 Summer Olympic Games at Wembley Stadium in London

'We decided in 2000 that we were 
going to bring my father back here,' Miss Glynn told ABC Online 'but unfortunately
he passed away a few years ago.'

'So my sister and myself, our 
husbands, our daughter and our grandchildren came with his ashes... and 
he's here with us as we watch the Triple Jump.'

Miss Glynn admitted that after watching the Triple Jump and the Usain Bolt run in the 200m final, the family went and scatters hsi ashes.

'We snuck ourselves down to the edge of 
the track and in the breeze we let his ashes go and they went right over
the Triple Jump track!''

She told ABC Online that when her father attended the Olympics in the 1940s it took three weeks for the team to fly to the UK and the plane broke down three times.

She said that once they arrived in Great Britain, the team were not at their optimum fitness, and her father ended up in hospital after contracting pneumonia.

Although he was planning to compete in both the Long Jump and the Triple Jump, on his release from hospital he was instructed to pick one event to compete in and he selected Triple Jump.

But Mr Avery was not a boastful man and Miss Glynn said it wasn't until she was aged 12 that realised he was an Olympian after seeing his medal in a drawer.

Later in life Mr Avery began to embrace his Olympic success and attended a lot of events for the 2000 Olympics and spoke at schools.
