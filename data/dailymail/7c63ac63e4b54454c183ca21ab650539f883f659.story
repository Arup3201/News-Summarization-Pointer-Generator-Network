Amnesty International has admitted to writing a letter to the Australian Government in support of crazed Sydney siege gunman Man Monis seeking asylum after the conman was successfully convincing in his perception of an Iranian spy.

Monis approached the human rights body in April 1997, under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi, claiming that his life was in danger after writing poetry published by an Iranian anti-regime outlet.

Amnesty wrote a letter of consideration to the Immigration Department to be taken into account in their determination of the Iranian national's refugee application before his visa was granted in 2001.

Amnesty wrote a letter supporting Monis' refugee application after reviewing Iranian anti-regime poetry he had published

'Mohamed Hassan Manteghi’s status as a cleric, his involvement with the Ministry of Intelligence, and his connections with high level individuals are relevant considerations which add objective weight to his fear of persecution, and to his fear of being targeted by the authorities outside Iran,' The Daily Telegraph reported the supposed letter from Amnesty International stated.

Amnesty refugee coordinator Dr Graham Thom highlighted the political nature of Mr Manteghi's poetry published in Iran, after reviewing copies of the work printed in the Payam-e Daneshju publication.

'As detailed in this letter, we confirmed that the Iranian authorities had arrested the publisher of this poetry in July 1996 for "publishing lies and causing public confusion",' he said. 

'The editor of this publication continues to be in and out of jail in Iran for his writing.'  

However, Dr Thom conceded if he had been the coordinator at the time then he would have been written the letter differently.

'Amnesty's processes have certainly changed … today when I get evidence we will only state something as a fact when we're able to verify it,' The Daily Telegraph reported.

'I'm not sure why (Monis's claims) were taken at face value.'  

He said Monis gave names that matched those of Iranian officials which was presented as evidence to the Australian government. 

Monis held 17 hostages for up to 16 hours in the Lindt cafe in Sydney last month

Terrorism expert Greg Barton said part of the issue was that Monis was a 'brilliant individual' who was 'very manipulative'.

'He was a good con artist - certainly not a regular person,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He also praised Amnesty for the handling of the costly blunder.

'It's easy to be critical - kudos to them for admitting to making a mistake.' 

Monis approached Amnesty International for a second time in August 2010 under the guise of Sheikh Haron.

He visited the Sydney office without notice and requested support.

'Amnesty International declined to provide him with assistance, as his case did not meet the organisation's human rights criteria,' Dr Thom said. 

'After declining this request for support, Amnesty International had no further involvement in his case and advised him to contact police.'
