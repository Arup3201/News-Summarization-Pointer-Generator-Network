A harbourmaster says Britain's ports are being littered with sunken boats which are being bought online by drunk amateur sailors.

Captain Paul Thomas has spent the past year clearing out all abandoned vessels from Fowey harbour in Cornwall at a cost of thousands of pounds.

He believes that would-be sailors are getting carried away after a few drinks and impulse buying second-hand fishing vessels through online auction site eBay.

Many boats, such as this one in Fowey harbour in Cornwall are being left to rot by their owners 

Fowey is an incredibly popular destination for boaters with a sheltered harbour and excellent mooring 

The hidden costs incurred with a boat such as mooring rates, maintenance and insurance, then scare the new owners who abandon their boats to rot in the harbour.

In the past week the authorities have rounded up a catamaran, a fishing boat, a yacht and other miscellaneous vessels that had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair.

When an abandoned vessel is identified a notice is issued to the owner, informing them they are required to either repair or remove the vessels.

If this is not done, the authorities assess the vessel, before selling it off if it is still sea-worthy, or scrapping it if it is too damaged.

Captain Thomas said: 'It's one of the plagues of harbour masters.

'People can be seduced into buying a boat really easily, often late at night and maybe after a few drinks, but buying it is the easy part - then there is mooring it, maintaining it and insuring it.

'They don't realise how expensive it is, can't afford it, and then we get left with the boats and the costs.

'It is time-consuming, and we have better things to do. Leaving a boat to rot is simply marine fly-tipping and we're not having it.

'People have a responsibility to the community, the environment and the harbour users.

'Fowey is a beautiful place and we want it to remain that way.

'We don't want derelicts making it look untidy and causing a possible environmental hazard.'
