Jewell-Belluccio, awarded Class A Coach of the Year in 2014, was hired by the school two years ago and also began working as a senior teacher's aide last year, according to the Democrat and Chronicle.

School district officials were informed of the allegations through rumors on Monday which led to an internal investigation.

They then alerted police, said Laurel Heiden, a spokeswoman for the district.

Cheerleaders from Jewell-Belluccio's squad are rallying behind her with many showing their support on social media.

One student wrote: 'Regardless of everything my coach was the best person I've met, and this won't shake my image of her. We love you JB. OHS always and forever.'

Another student wrote  that she felt bad for the cheerleaders and said that Jewell-Belluccio brought the cheer program back on its feet.

Her tweet said: 'I just feel so bad for the cheerleaders. They must feel awful right now. She brought the cheer program back on its feet...it's just so sad.'

Following the incident, Jewell-Belluccio resigned from her position at the school and was released on bail.

She will face the charges at Greece Town Court on March 11.
