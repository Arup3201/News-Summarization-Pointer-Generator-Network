A six-month old baby girl has died from meningococcal disease in Adelaide and four other people have been diagnosed with the infection this month.

A one-year-old, two-year-old, and two women in their 40s have been identified as the other four SA patients battling the disease.Â 

South Australia Health has issued a public health warning after the tragic death on Monday and a spike in cases of meningococcal, including 16 so far in 2014, compared to 17 at the same time last year.

Chief Public Health Officer Dr Stephen Christley said that 'meningococcal infection numbers tend to be higher when there are more respiratory infections around, such as influenza'.

Dr Stephen Christley, Chief Public Health Officer for South Australia Health, issued a warning about meningococcal disease on Thursday

'As we have experienced increased numbers of cases in the past few weeks we're asking the general public to be aware of the symptoms of meningococcal disease and seek medical advice if necessary,' Dr Christley said.

Around 10 per cent of the population carry the meningococcus bacteria around in the nose and throat of but it is usually harmless.

Dr Christley issued a reminder on the symptoms, stating they 'may include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sore muscles, followed in some cases by a rash of red and purple spots'.

'Babies or young children with meningococcal infection may also be fretful, refuse feeds or be difficult to wake,' he added.

People who are particularly at risk in SA will be given antibiotic chemoprophylaxis as a preventative measure.

Meningococcal bacteria can cause meningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain, and septicaemia, an infection in the bloodstream

The infection can develop quickly and lead to serious illness or even death. Early diagnosis and emergency treatment with antibiotics are vital.

Across Australia, over 250 cases of meningococcal disease are diagnosed each year. Most most cases are seen in infants, young children, teenagers and young adults but people of any age can be infected.

In August, Daily Mail Australia revealed how a Sunshine Coast toddler, who was just 13 months old when he contracted the disease and spent two and a half weeks in a coma fighting for his life, has taken his first ever steps after doctors fit him with a new set of prosthetic legs.

Brave little meningococcal survivor Finn Smith, now 22 months old, had to have both feet and one of his hands amputated after they were badly affected by bruising.

Last month he went to his final fitting at Sunshine Orthopaedic Services in Nambour where prosthetist Dewet Heyns gave Finn his 'click clicks' - the nickname the toddler has given his new legs because of the clicking noise they make when he puts them on.

On November 22 last year Sunshine Coast toddler Finn Smith was raced to hospital he was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks

Finn Smith has made a remarkable recovery and now has new legs

Finn's mother Sarah Smith said she had to hold back tears as she watched him take his first steps forward with the aid of a walking frame.

'It just gives me that hope that he'll be able to do everything he would have been able to do before the illness,' Ms Smith said.

Finn's new legs mark an important step in his recovery journey, but it has been a long nine months for his parents Sarah and Jason Smith.

On the night of November 21 last year, Finn had been up all night with flu-like symptoms and every once in a while he would get the shakes.

The couple had an on-call doctor visit at 1am, who diagnosed him with a viral infection and told them to get him antibiotics in the morning.

The next day during a car trip to Brisbane, they noticed three bruise-like dots on his forehead.

They raced to the nearest hospital, which was seven minutes away at Redcliffe, and when they arrived Finn was admitted straight away.

'Within half an hour he was pretty much unrecognisable,' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

Finn was crying tears of blood, blood was coming out of his mouth and his body had puffed up.

'The meningococcal had done its incubation time the night before,' she added.

'You don't know until the spots come out and once the rash comes out the damage is done - your little boy is fighting for his life.'
