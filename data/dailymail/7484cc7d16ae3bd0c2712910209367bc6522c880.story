Country Life featured Ella Clark on its frontispiece after a letter from her fiance Ian Fortune

Country Life's legendary 'Girls in Pearls' are often the daughters of the aristocracy.

So this month's frontispiece, personal trainer Ella Clark – and especially the manner in which she was chosen for the slot – makes a refreshing change for the 117-year-old magazine.

The former RAF officer, 29, was picked when her fiancé – a squadron leader – contacted the magazine's editor after being wounded by a bullet during a tour of Afghanistan.

In a heartfelt letter, Ian Fortune, 32, explained what it would mean to have his fiancée in the quintessentially English magazine's pages and an unlikely plot was hatched by its editor.

Secret arrangements were made for a three-day photoshoot in rural North Yorkshire and Miss Clark was whisked away and given a makeover.

She told the Telegraph: 'It was a bit of a shock when I ﬁrst found out what he had done but I am always up for trying these things.

'It was amazing, all a bit overwhelming but really good fun. They were really nice people and the weather from the ﬁrst day was really nice so it was great to be involved – and Ian loves it, which is the most important thing.'

Sqn Ldr Fortune said: 'The mere sight of Ella takes me back to those timeless frontispiece girls in pearls. Everything Ella and I stand for, our love for the country, the countryside, to keep this country protected and great for future generations seem to be embodied in Country Life.'

Mr Fortune added that he had ordered the magazine for his unit – 27 Squadron RAF – during its tour of duty in the wartorn country because it 'gave us all a tangible link with home – no mean feat given we were in a war zone 4,000 miles away'.

Already a devoted reader, he said he found it especially comforting during the months he spent recovering from a Taliban bullet that hit him above the eye.

The Chinook pilot was injured while ﬂying wounded soldiers back to Camp Bastion in 2010 and won the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery as a result.

Mark Hedges, the magazine's editor, said Mr Fortune's letter was so moving that he immediately made arrangements to feature Miss Clark.

He said: 'When I got that letter from Ian it just melted my heart. Here was a guy who had been injured in Afghanistan and the first thing his team bought him in hospital were his pyjamas and a copy of Country Life.

'We send a lot of issues to Afghanistan and at one point they were using it as a way to teach the interpreters English.

'It is heartening to know that image of the green and pleasant land which is captured by the magazine still strikes a chord with our servicemen and women abroad.'

Famously known as the 'Girls in Pearls' page because many of its early debutante models wore pearls, it aims to show upper class British rural life in its most ideal light.

The pair, who live near Farnham, Surrey, will marry later this month in Yorkshire.
