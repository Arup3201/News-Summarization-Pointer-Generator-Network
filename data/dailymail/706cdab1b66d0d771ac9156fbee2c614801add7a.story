These shocking images shows the moment a wheelchair-bound cerebral palsy sufferer was carried out of a bar by bouncers who said he could only stay if he stood up.

Troy Hitchins, 20, had gone to the pub with his friends on Saturday night, but was told he could only stay in the upstairs bar if he could get out of the wheelchair.

Mr Hitchins, who can only walk with the aid of crutches, was then hauled from the bar by two bouncers and carried down the stairs.

'Embarrassed': Mr Hitchins, 20, accused the pub of discriminating against him after he was hauled from the upstairs bar

His stunned friends captured the 'disgusting' moment he was carried out of the bar, in Birmingham, on their mobile phones.

Mr Hitchins said he felt 'humiliated' by his ordeal and accused the pub of discrimination.

'I felt embarrassed, I felt really embarrassed when door staff carried me down the stairs. I felt everyone was watching me,' he said.

'I didn't argue when they said I could stay if I could stand because I'm not an argumentative person.

'Would they have said to a blind person, "you can stay if you can see"? It was the first time I've been in the pub, but I won't go back.'

The talented wheelchair basketball player was carried up to the first-floor bar because the disabled lift was broken.

The pub has since apologised on its Facebook page, but said Mr Hitchins had to leave the upstairs area because of health and safety concerns

But when bouncers spotted Mr Hitchins was upstairs, they informed the group they were breaching health and safety regulations and that he would have to go downstairs.

His family now want to know why staff allowed friends to carry him up the stairs in the first place and demanded an apology.

Mr Hitchins' mother Zakalin Sloly said: 'When I saw the picture of Troy being carried down the stairs, his head bowed, I could tell he was absolutely mortified.

'They say it was for health and safety reasons, but I thought you can't use a lift when there's a fire.'

The pub has since apologised on its Facebook page but stressed the actions were taken in the best interests of the 20-year-old and his group.

Pub manager Richard Perry also pointed out the party were told they could use the ground floor bar and did so.

In a lengthy Facebook post, the Mr Perry said staff were initially unaware Mr Hitchins had been taken upstairs.

'On behalf of the Kings Head, I would firstly like to apologise for any ill feeling felt by the disabled gentleman identified in the photograph. This was by no means intended,' he said.

'This decision was taken to comply with health and safety practices and to negate any risk to any disabled persons and our non-disabled patrons

'To comply with the Equality Act 2010 we would offer the use of the ground floor to any person unable to utilise the Attic [upstairs bar].

'It was also agreed the gentlemen and his party of between 20 to 30 would be allowed to carry on their night on the ground floor, which we would keep open past our normal midnight closing time, until they left which was at 1.45am on Sunday.

'We have liaised with our legal representatives Capita to ensure we have complied with current discriminatory legislation and also Health and Safety legislation.

'We are deeply sorry for any confusion caused and we aim to ensure all affected parties involved in this matter are treated with the utmost decency.'

Comments were mixed on the Facebook page, with some criticising the pub while others defended its actions.

Shanta Darling wrote: 'Telling the man in the wheel chair he can stay if he could stand. Disgraceful.'

But Mandy Churcher said: 'The manner in which you dealt with your customers is best business practice taking into account health & safety, risk assessments, well done.'
