Juan Cuadrado has shown Louis van Gaal exactly what he's missing, as the Inter Milan winger scored a beauty for Fiorentina against Inter Milan at the weekend.

The 26-year-old Columbian international had been linked with a move to Old Trafford at the start of the summer, but instead opted to stay in Italy. 

There has been much speculation over Cuadrado's offer of a new contract at Fiorentina. It has been reported that a £50,000-a-week offer is on the table, but the player's representatives want £70,000 - an amount La Viola aren't keen on extending to.

This will give Van Gaal and Manchester United fresh optimism in their pursuit of the player, and if a fresh deal cannot be ironed out at Fiorentina, Cuadrado could be the next player through the door at Old Trafford. 

If he is unhappy in Italy though, it doesn't show here, as the goal is followed by wild celebrations.

Cuadrado's strike was Fiorentina's second of the match, and they went on to win 3-0 at the Artemio Franchi stadium.

The win takes Fiorentina to 9th in Serie A, leapfrogging their opponents Inter Milan in the process.
