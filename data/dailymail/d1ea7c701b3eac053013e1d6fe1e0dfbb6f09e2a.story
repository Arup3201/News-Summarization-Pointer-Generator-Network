A woman whose genitals were mutilated by a disgraced gynaecologist has broken down outside a Sydney courtroom on Friday after facing the man she says devastated her life.

Graeme Stephen Reeves, dubbed the Butcher of Bega, served just 18 months behind bars after he was found guilty for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire.

The rogue practitioner, who worked in Bega on the NSW south coast, surgically removed her clitoris and labia without consent during an operation on a pre-cancerous lesion in August 2002.

Dr Graeme Reeves was released from jail in December after serving just 18 months

He was sentenced to a maximum three-and-a-half years jail in 2011 but was released on parole from Sydney's Long Bay prison in December after he successfully appealed to the High Court.

This consequently sparked outrage among Ms DeWaegeneire's supporters and patient advocates.

Crown prosecutors want the 64-year-old back behind bars for another year after previous rulings that his original sentence was 'manifestly inadequate'.

Reeves and Ms DeWaegeneire, from Wolumla near Bega, sat within metres of each other during an appeal hearing at the NSW Court of Appeal.

It was adjourned until June 2 when Chief Justice Thomas Bathurst and justices Peter Hall and Robert Hulme are expected to hand down a decision.

'My life has been totally, totally devastated - totally,' a tearful Ms DeWaegeneire said outside court after the hearing.

'I should be enjoying life as an older person - I'm not.'

She described Reeves's original sentence as 'the biggest joke of all time'.

'I've got my medical records. I know damn well what I had before I went in (to hospital). I know damn well what he did.'

During his trial, Reeves's lawyers argued the former doctor was saving Ms DeWaegeneire's life and rejected the crown's argument that he did not have consent to remove her genitals.

It's understood hundreds of other women have also complained about the former doctor.

The Department of Public Prosecutions revealed in November that a significant number of outstanding charges against Reeves, dating more than 20 years, had been dropped.

The allegations against Reeves were not pursued because of 'insufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable prospect of conviction', NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith said.

Reeves' lawyer, Gabrielle Bashir, on Friday said her client was in poor health and suffering kidney disease and chronic depression, among other conditions, and argued he should not go back to jail.

Prosecutors tendered a doctors' report that stated his health conditions could be adequately treated in prison.

Reeves made no comment as he left court.

Graeme Stephen Reeves first appointed as a visiting medical officer at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital in 1985, according to NSW Health Department documents

About 35 complaints were made over 20 different incidents about Mr Reevesâ€™s behaviour and clinical practice, starting on June 1986

Mr Reeves was banned from obstetrics in July 1997

Psychiatric reports, dating from 1996 to 2004, diagnosed him with a personality disorder and also said he prominent narcissistic features and was at times severely depressed

Reeves continued to practice obstetrics  in hospitals around NSW's south coast region hospitals from April 2002 to January 2003  and gynaecology until the termination of his contract in July 2003

There were complaints made at the end of 2002 about difficult working relationships between Reeves and staff at Pambula Hospital and by November 14, the hospital did not provide obstetric services

Then in 2003 similar complaints were received about Bega Hospital staff and Reeves, as well as obstetric services he provided to a patient at the hospital in January

He was found guilty by the District Court jury in 2011 for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire after he mutilated her clitoris and labia without her consent during an operation to take out a pre-cancerous lesion in 2002. He was released from jail last December after serving just 18-months of his three-and-a-half year sentence.
