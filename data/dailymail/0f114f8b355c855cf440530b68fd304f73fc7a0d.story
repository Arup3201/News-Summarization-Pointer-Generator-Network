It might look like a child's toy thrown into the snow, but this is the stunning design for a ski lodge.

Czech architecture firm Atelier 8000 has proposed an incredibly unique take on a typical mountain accommodation - and the designs are spectacular.

Their Kežmarské Hut, a concept designed for an international competition, is a futuristic, sustainable structure made of aluminum, glass and solar panels.

Oh, and did we mention that it's a cube that has been entirely rotated onto one of its corners?

The contemporary building is intended to be situated high in the High Tatra Mountains and will be able to function completely off the grid, even at such a high altitude.

Designed to merge into the mountainous background, almost as if part of a retreating glacier, the construction amplifies the use of light and shadows - much like that which can be observed on neighbouring rocks.

The shape of the hut allows the building to utilise solar energy to the maximum possible extent, with the panels that generate energy facing southwards and eastwards.

Perfect for adventurous hikers and travellers, the five-storey building includes extensive ski storage space, two floors of guest rooms, an attic meditation room, a restaurant and a deck. 

Plus, its orientation provides plenty of intimate corners where visitors can relax and enjoy breathtaking views.

In the warmer months, guests will be able to relax on the hotel's patio, which wraps around two of the building's sides.

The proposed interior has many timber beams, as well as modern, minimalist furniture 

The top floor of the hut offers extra accommodation spaces, as well as a meditation room overlooking the mountains
