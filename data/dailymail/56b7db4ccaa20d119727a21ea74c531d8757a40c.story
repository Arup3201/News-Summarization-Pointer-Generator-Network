Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, has been charged with killing his wife and the woman's sister 

Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month.

The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses.  

Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. 

He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted.

Prosecutors have not offered any motive for the slayings. Steele's attorney, Jessa Nicholson, said during a court hearing Friday that she plans to investigate Steele's mental stability. 

She appeared with Steele via video conference from the Rock County jail, where Steele is being held because of his close relationship with Dane County jailers. 

He sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit and looked directly at the camera as Nicholson spoke.

'He wants to work within (the criminal justice) system to see this to its conclusion,' she said.

According to a criminal complaint filed Friday, Tollefsbol, 38, called police August 22 from the Steele home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. She said Steele had shot her and she was dying.

Police arrived and found Tollefsbol in the basement, shot in the back and covered with blood, the complaint said. She again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died at a hospital about an hour after making her call for help.

A Dane County sheriff's SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, dead in the master bedroom. She had been shot in the head and had a zip-tie wrapped around her throat, cutting off circulation, the complaint said.

The SWAT team found Andrew Steele in a laundry room with a handgun. The dryer was running but was vented back into the room. A portable grill was also in the room and was very hot and loaded with charcoal. 

An officer secured the handgun but Steele put up a fight before the team subdued him, the complaint said.

Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor

No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account 

Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than $20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative 

Investigators had said previously that Steele suffered injuries consistent with a suicide attempt but didn't offer details beyond saying he wasn't shot. Assistant District Attorney Paul Barnett told reporters Friday that Steele was treated for smoke inhalation at a Milwaukee medical facility.

The complaint does not suggest a motive, and Barnett declined to comment on the investigation.

Court Commissioner Scott McAndrew set Steele's bail at $1million and ordered him to have no contact with his children or any members of his wife's family.

Barnett had asked for $5million, arguing that Steele planned the slayings and would have nothing to lose if he were released and attacked other family members. Barnett also argued that Steele could use money his family raised for his medical bills on bail.

Nicholson said the money has been placed in a holding account and will be transferred to a charity. 

She asked for $100,000 bail and that he be allowed to call the couple's two children, arguing that he doesn't have much time left to spend with them because of his disease.

McAndrew said he was not comfortable with anything less than $1million.

Steele's wife was spearheading a drive to raise $75,000 for his medical care; her Facebook page is full of videos of Steele's law enforcement colleagues taking ice bucket challenges on his behalf. They had raised about $23,000 when Ashlee Steele died.

Steele's preliminary hearing is set for September 4.

Steele was ordered held on $1million bail and barred from contacting his family 

Fitchburg Police were called to the Steeles' home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1pm last Friday.

According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots.

Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

Members of a sheriff's department SWAT team found Ashlee Steele dead in the home. She had been shot in the head. They found Andrew Steele in a laundry room and a 9 mm pistol on the counter. 

He had not been shot but had non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt.

The affidavit said two rounds had been fired in the house. 

The Steeles have two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband have four children.

Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed.

Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4.

His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses.

The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May. 

 

The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed.

'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said.

It had got so bad, the website said, that the muscle-twitching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food. 

Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.'

Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive

Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.'

The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael.

Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.'

According to the sisters' obituaries, Kacee Tollefsbol was studying to be a nurse and held a degree in English from the University of St. Thomas. A mother of four, she had just married Mark Tollefsbol a month before she died. Ashlee Steele, a mother of two, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and taught three-year-olds at a church preschool.
