Leading: Robert Peston has broken a series of scoops on the Libor scandal, but has previously been accused of being a 'stooge'

He was at centre of the Northern Rock crisis leading to accusations his exclusive story prompted an unprecedented run on the bank.

Now BBC Business Editor Robert Peston is in the spotlight again today after revealing a series of stories about the Barclays market-rigging crisis.

Mr Peston's stories - which could only have come from a top-level source - have diverted attention away from the bank and on to the Bank of England.

They come in the aftermath of revelations that Barclays staff submitted false numbers to the inter-bank lending rate in a bid to improve the bank's borrowing position during the heart of the 2008 financial crisis.

The financial news journalist yesterday revealed that Barclays staff apparently made the lower Libor submissions after a telephone call between the Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker and Bob Diamond in 2008.

His story effectively turned attention on the Bank of England at a critical time for Barclays as pressure grew on Bob Diamond to resign.

Later he was first with news of the resignation of Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, in a move that was hoped to reduce pressure on Mr Diamond to quit.

Questions may yet be asked about the timings of such stories.

On his BBC blog, he wrote yesterday: 'Mr Agius has told the bank's board he is going - and an announcement will be made tomorrow.'

Breaking news: Robert Peston's Tweets on the Barclays Libor-fixing scandal

In September 2007, Mr Peston broke news of Northern Rock's application to the Bank of England for financial support. The report was blamed for a run on the bank in which customers queued to pull their money out.

Mr Peston has previously been 
described as a 'market menace' after his reporting of a private meeting 
between then Chancellor Alistair Darling and bank leaders at the height 
of the 2008 financial crisis preceded a huge crash in share prices.

RBS saw £10bn - 40 per cent of its value - wiped off its shares in October of that year.

As a result of alleged Treasury leaks, Tory MP Greg Hands asked the Serious Fraud Office to 
investigate alleged 'fraudulent behaviour' at the heart of Government.

The following year, commentators 
questioned whether Mr Peston was a Government stooge when he reported on
the value of RBS boss Fred Goodwin's pension.

The
story overshadowed the news that state-backed RBS had made the biggest 
corporate loss in UK history - £24bn, putting the spotlight on the 
company's management rather than ministers.
