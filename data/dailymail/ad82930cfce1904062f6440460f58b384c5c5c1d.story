Blur frontman Damon Albarn last night waded into the row over Jeremy Clarkson's number plate scandal, describing the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole'.

Speaking to fans ahead of a concert in Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, the singer apologised for Clarkson's behaviour, telling them that he thought the stunt was 'not cool'.

Clarkson and his team were forced to flee the country last week after locals were incensed by the H982 FKL number plate on his Porsche, which they said was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War.

Speaking out: Blur frontman Damon Albarn, pictured left, described the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole'

Albarn told the cheering crowd at the city's Gran Rex Theatre: 'I'm sure it was all in the press here but I want to really apologise for all the behaviour of a guy called Jeremy Clarkson who does a show called Top Gear.'

Making a rude hand gesture, he added: 'He's a f***ing a***hole... not cool.' 

The row erupted when photos of Clarkson's FKL registration were posted on the internet by angry Argentinians who claimed the Top Gear presenter was mocking their country.

The show's convoy was then attacked by a gang armed with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles, forcing Clarkson and fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond to flee into Chile.

Clarkson later took to Twitter insisting the number plate was a coincidence and was switched to a neutral plate - H1 VAE - as soon as the reference to the Falklands was spotted.

But Argentinian police yesterday revealed that two further plates were later found inside his abandoned vehicle - one white and one yellow - bearing the registration number BE11 END.

The discovery throws Clarkson's claims that the plates were a coincidence into doubt after it emerged that the BBC has contacted the man who sold them the vehicle in an alleged 'cover-up'.

A local official said: 'We know bellend doesn't mean the end of the bell and is a word used instead to describe the head of the penis which is often employed as an insult in England.

'We regard it as another insult to the people of Argentina. We're sure the Top Gear team were planning another provocation with the number plate in the same way they provoked us with the one referencing the Falklands War.'

Controversy: The anger was sparked by the H982 FKL plate, which locals say was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War

It also emerged this morning that the Top Gear has told a car dealer who sold the crew the Porsche to pass on any enquiries about the sale to them.

Mark Waring, of Surrey-based Rennsport Classics, told MailOnline: 'Top Gear contacted me and gave me the number of their press office to hand to anyone who contacted me.'

The controversy over the alleged 'cover up' comes as Falklands War veterans in southern Argentina announced they would file a formal complaint to a court considering whether to open a criminal investigation for alleged falsification.

Osvaldo Hillar, a member of the Commission of Falklands War veterans in Ushuaia, where Clarkson encountered most problems, confirmed the intention today.

He said: 'I like to deal with things diplomatically and I want to see this through to the end and make sure justice is done because you don't cause offence to our dead and the question of the Malvinas.

'We will be filing a formal complaint to the courts and leaving it in the hands of the judicial system.' 

Clarkson admitted at the weekend the number plate on his Porsche was changed after the problems he experienced.

Court sources in the city of Rio Grande, which is expected to announce next week if it is opening a criminal investigation, say the crime of falsification for using different number plates to those in a car's official documentation carries a prison sentence of six months to three years.

Under fire: Argentinian Police have now revealed they have found another set of offensive number plates in the car. The discovery casts doubt over Jeremy Clarkson's claim that the original number plate was a coincidence

Federico Sciurano, mayor of Ushuaia, described last week's violence, which ended with the Top Gear team being stoned by angry locals as they drove towards Chile with a police escort, as a 'great mistake.' 

He said after Clarkson's departure: 'We have committed a great mistake with the violence. That never resolves anything and the impact it was going to have was not taken into account.

'Instead of talking today about a person who was trying to be clever, we're talking about the victimisation of that same person.

'Obviously I don't agree with violence and smashing windows of a car wasn't necessary.

'I believe the people responsible made a big mistake when they decided to act in that manner because now the news is that they decided to smash up the cars instead of talking about the real issue.'
