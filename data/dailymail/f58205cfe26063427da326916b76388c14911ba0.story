Anonymous call: This payphone a mile from Yale's campus is in all likelihood the one used by a 911 caller on Monday. Authorities have revealed they now have surveillance footage of the caller

Police say they have images from a surveillance camera of the suspect who made a phone call saying an armed man was heading to shoot up Yale University.

Authorities in Connecticut also say they have identified several people of interest in their investigation following Monday's six-hour campus lockdown.

Police on Tuesday said they were leaning toward the incident being a prank and that they are now conducting interviews.

According to the Hartford Courant, 
New Haven Police Chief Dean Esserman characterized the caller as 
distracted and that more people on campus began to doubt his story as 
the day progressed.

Police have revealed that the call came from a pay phone a mile from campus, on the 300 block of Columbus Avenue in New Haven.

‘[He] sounded like a confused gentleman,’ Esserman said. ‘I wouldn't describe his words as clear and concise.’

Two witnesses would later report seeing a gunman, but that now appears to have been a false alarm.

‘It
now appears that the man [the Yale employee] saw may have been one of 
the early responding police officers carrying a rifle,’ Yale Vice 
President Linda Koch Lorimer said in a statement.

SWAT teams searching the Ivy League campus didn't find a gunman after a room-by-room search. No one was injured.

SWAT: The 9:48am call prompted multiple SWAT teams and police agencies to swarm the Yale campus

No gunman: The lockdown remained in effect on the Old Campus for six hours on Monday afternoon as police searched rooms to confirm that no gunman is on campus

Mistaken identity: Two early reports of someone seen carrying a 'long' gun are now believed to have been the first police responders

A
911 call was received at 9:48am Monday from a man at a pay phone about a
mile from the campus who said his roommate was on the way to the 
university to shoot people.

The response included several police departments, the FBI and other federal agencies including multiple SWAT teams.

A campus-wide text alert went out at 10:17am. By 4:40pm the alert had been lift, with no sign of a shooter.

Shortly thereafter, students were already breathing a sigh of relief.

‘It feels good now to be finally let out,’ said freshman Samantha Brown. ‘It just feels safe right now and I'm glad it's over.’

Classes aren't in session this week because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Undergraduate classes are set to resume Dec. 2.

Persons of interest: School was out for Thanksgiving at the time of the scare. Police say they are now interviewing several persons of interest
