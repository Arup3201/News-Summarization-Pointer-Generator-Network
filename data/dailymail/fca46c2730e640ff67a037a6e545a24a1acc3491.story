This is the bizarre moment traffic came to a standstill when a huge dragon-shaped hot air balloon landed just metres from a busy road and collided with a lamppost.

The canopy got into difficulty over Bridgeyate in South Gloucestershire after an eight-mile flight from Bristol’s Ashton Court on Thursday evening.

It was one of more than 100 taking part in the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta this weekend - where more than 500,000 people are expected over the weekend.

Motorists screeched to a halt as the balloon rapidly descended - prompting Aaron Hanks to start filming.

Deflated descent: Motorists screeched to a halt as the Dragon-shaped balloon descended towards the busy road in Bridgeyate, South Gloucestershire

Deflated descent: The pilot seems to be trying to land the canopy, but gets into trouble and ends up getting stuck, before setting down in a field

His film shows the balloon hit the lamppost, then a tree, before sinking beside the pole and coming to a stop near the road.

Throughout this weekend, balloons will be ascending from Ashton Court Estate at dawn and dusk,
 taking in glorious views of the city including Isambard Kingdom 
Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge.

Performances
 of the Last Post will be played on a violin, oboe, saxophone and dhol 
drum during the evening ascents to mark the First World War centenary. 

The
 fiesta also includes a number of aerial displays from helicopters and 
aircraft, including the RAF Typhoon Display team, flown by 29 (Reserve) 
Squadron from RAF Coningsby.

Speaking at the mass ascent this morning, organiser Ben Hardy described the sight as 'fantastic'.

'It has been a brilliant morning, we had almost 130 balloons up and the weather conditions were perfect.

'The best bit for me is seeing all the crowds enjoying the spectacle, you see so many families and people having a great time.

'There are some interesting special shapes this year. My daughter is a huge fan of the Smurfs so that one has to top it for me.'

This smiling balloon was one of the first of the fleet to take off this morning, and went on to soar over Bristol

The good weather is expected to stay for this evening's festivities as well as tomorrow morning, though showers may creep in on Saturday night and Sunday. 

Pilot Under Training Zack Daly, 16, took to the skies with the supervision of his father Joe Daly, 55.

Zack, who is one of the youngest pilots in the UK and will gain his full licence on his 17th birthday in February, said: 'It was very good.

'The atmosphere was the best, with all the crowds. Flying here is a bit of a challenge but it definitely paid off today - the views were amazing.

'I like heights and unlike being in a plane, you actually feel like you're flying when you're in a balloon. It looks like a picture, it is so still up there.'

His father, a lecturer at Waterford Institute of Technology, in the Republic of Ireland, added: 'It was absolutely fantastic.

'We are the only balloon here from Ireland and we are made to feel so welcome here in Bristol.

'Zack
 is probably the youngest pilot in the UK and he will be fully qualified
 on his 17th birthday. At that stage he will be one of the youngest in 
Europe.'

The 2014 Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, which runs from yesterday night until Sunday evening, is free to enter.
