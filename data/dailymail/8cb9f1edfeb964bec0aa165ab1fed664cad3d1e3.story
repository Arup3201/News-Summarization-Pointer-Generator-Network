It's not everyday that commuters get to share a train journey with Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, Mickey Mouse, Spiderman and even the Incredible Hulk, but one talented animator has done just that with the aid of some well-placed scraps of paper.

The How To Pass Time On A Train series of drawings, was created by October Jones, aka talented animator Joe Butcher.

The doodles, sketched over several years, found global internet fame after they were shared by thousands of Twitter and Facebook users, while Mr Butcher's popular YouTube videos have been viewed almost one million times.

The artist, who is also behind the book and Tumblr feed Texts From Dog, has turned his fellow train passengers into a host of characters, from a stubbly looking Winnie The Pooh, to extra terrestrial E.T, before photographing the often amusing results.

Mr Butcher, who grew up in Birmingham, has also made music videos for comedy band The Amateur Transplants, and has undertaken animation work for the BBC.
