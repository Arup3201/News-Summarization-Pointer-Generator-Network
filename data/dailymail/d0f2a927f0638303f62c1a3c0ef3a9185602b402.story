TV presenter Gabby Logan was drawn into the tax-avoidance scandal yesterday after it emerged she invested in the same tax shelter as Take That.

The sports pundit, who is part of the BBC’s football World Cup presenting team, poured her money into a £12.3million scheme designed to hide earnings from the tax man.

The 41-year-old is one of a host of stars – including singer Gary Barlow and several of his Take That bandmates – who have invested £336million in the controversial Icebreaker Management fund.

Earlier this month, a tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment scheme and had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim income tax relief.

The ruling means Mrs Logan and the other investors could now be forced to pay back millions to HMRC.

It is not known exactly how much money Mrs Logan poured into the scheme. According to the Mirror, she joined an Icebreaker partnership called Ivancroft in 2008.

Although it purported to be a creative industries investment scheme, Ivancroft made a loss of £11.7million.

Its real purpose was to allow its members to offset their investments against the tax they owed on their other earnings.

It is thought Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back HMRC.

They put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman.

Other well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of Charles Tyrwhitt shirts.

It is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme.

Both Jackson and Venables have insisted their tax affairs are in order and have denied they joined Icebreaker to avoid tax.

However, judge Colin Bishopp ruled Icebreaker ‘is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.’

Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is ‘opposed to all aggressive tax avoidance’ but refused to join calls for Barlow to be stripped of his OBE.

Mrs Logan’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.

A year before joining Ivancroft the mother-of-two – who is married to former Scotland rugby player Kenny Logan - gave an interview about her finances.

Asked about saving for retirement, she said: ‘Property and the odd speculative investment. As well as property and Isas, I have occasionally bought shares and invested in businesses.’

The star lives in a £3.8million seven-bedroom house in High Wycombe, Bucks.
