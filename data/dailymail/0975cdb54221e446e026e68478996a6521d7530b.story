First and youngest: Noah Pozner was the youngest of the 16 six-year-olds who was killed in the shooting on Friday

Just three days after the young children were gunned down in their classrooms, a half-dozen of their bodies are now being prepared for coffins as the first funerals will be held on Monday.

The first funeral on Monday is that of Noah Pozner, the youngest of the 16 six-year-old victims. The funeral for his friend Jack Pinto will be held at the same time at a Newtown facility, and a wake will be held for James Mattioli, also 6-years-old, later that afternoon.

James and fellow Catholic student Jessica Rekos will both have funeral services at St. Rose  of Lima Church on Tuesday, and Rachel D'Avino is going to be buried in neighboring Watertown that same day.

The first adult victim's funeral will take place on Wednesday when the 27-year-old heroic teacher Victoria Soto has her service. Student Daniel Barden will have his funeral on the same day.

Those are just six of the 20 funerals for the student victims that the town's clergy need to coordinate and host in the coming week, a task so daunting that 100 funeral directors from across the state have volunteered to help the process.

Some have donated use of their hearses and time, while coffin manufacturers have given heart-wrenchingly small child-sized caskets for the victims.

The Pozner family, which includes Noah's twin sister Arielle who he called 'his best friend' and their 8-year-old sister Sophia, reportedly moved to Newtown from Brooklyn a year ago because they felt that New York City schools were not safe enough for the young children.

House of worship: Noah's funeral will be held at the Adath Israel temple on Monday, kicking off a grim week where 20 young children and six of their teachers are laid to rest

'The reason they moved to that area is because they did not consider any school in New York state on the same level. That's one of the reasons they moved, for safety and education,' Noah's uncle Arthur Pozner told CBS News.

Arielle survived because she had been assigned to a different class than her brother, placing her out of the gunman's path when the shooting took place.

Noah's mother was supported by their family rabbi when she saw her son's dead body for the first time on Sunday.

The New York Times reports that she listened to the suggestion of the social worker who warned that she should not lift the sheet covering the boy's corpse, which only exposed his head and neck.

Newtown's only undertaker is so overwhelmed with grisly mortuary tasks like covering up bullet holes that he has been forced to hire an additional 30 staffers.

Daniel Honan, the director of Honan Funeral Home, said he’s hired between 25 and 30 new staffers to handle the 11 victims from Friday's Sandy Hook massacre, reports the Daily News.

Honan said the additional workers will help handle what called it 'the week from hell.'

'I’ve never seen anything like this, never,” Honan said. 'We added staff to meet the demand and do what we do.'

Since the funeral home opened in 1903, none of the previous generations of morticians has been tasked with providing services for so many grieving families at once, according to the News.

Honan said his staff is working around the clock for a week’s worth of wakes.

And to conceal gruesome bullet holes.

'We’re trained to cover them up,' he said. 'We have people with special skills to do that. Some caskets will be open and some will be closed.'

For his biggest fan: Before the Giants took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, Cruz tweeted: 'Today's game is for you, Jack'

The devout Jewish family have announced that memorial contributions donated in the boy's name will be used to fund the planting of trees in Israel.

Jack Pinto's remembrances have been a combination of intimately private and publicly broadcast.

After his family said that they were going to bury the avid football fan in the jersey of his favorite Giants player, Victor Cruz announced that he would pay tribute to the little boy by writing his name on his cleats for their game against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.

Though the nationally-televised game drew a great deal of attention to the young boy and their family, they decided to keep the wake on Monday private.
