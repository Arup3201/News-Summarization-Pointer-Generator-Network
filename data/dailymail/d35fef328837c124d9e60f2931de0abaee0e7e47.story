The South African head of an international aid group, his two children and an Afghan have been killed in an attack on a guesthouse in Kabul.

Police chief General Mohammed Zahir said the four were killed in the attack the day before, revising an earlier toll. He gave no ages for the children, and did not identify the organisation.

Gen Zahir said one of the three attackers wore a police uniform. The police chief's spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai later confirmed Gen Zahir had resigned his post, without providing details.

Qadam Shah Shaheem, commander of the Afghan army's 111 Military Corps Kabul, said yesterday that one Taliban fighter was killed when his suicide vest exploded and the other two attackers were shot.

Eight people, including two foreigners, were rescued from the building in Kabul's western Karte Seh district during the four-hour gunbattle, according to yesterday's reports.

Those reports had initially claimed that two people died in the attack. It is not known whether those rescued subsequently died of their injuries or whether more bodies were subsequently found.

'The attackers first shot dead the director as they entered the building,' Gen Zahir said at a press conference. The South African's son and daughter were also killed, as well as an Afghan citizen.

After the event, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanakzai told AFP that Gen Zahir had resigned.

'General Zahir Zahir told the interior ministry he no longer wanted to continue his job. The minister has accepted his resignation,' Stanikzai told AFP.

The attack was the second in as many days on guesthouses occupied by foreigners.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed on Twitter that the compound hit on Saturday was that of a secret Christian missionary group and that a meeting of Australian visitors had been hit. 

'A spate of deadly martyrdom attacks have rocked important enemy targets in recent days,' Mujahid added. 

Kabul has seen eight deadly suicide attacks against high-profile targets in the past 16 days, one of the most violent periods in the capital in years.

In recent days, four foreigners — including an employee of the British embassy — have been killed, and dozens of Afghan civilians have been killed and wounded.

The most-recent Kabul attack came as Afghan army soldiers fought Taliban fighters inside Camp Bastion, the major southern base handed over to Afghans by British forces in October.

A few dozen Taliban fighters with automatic weapons and suicide vests had attacked the base in Helmand province on Thursday, General Ayatullah Khan, commander of the army regiment in the area, said.

'Some managed to get inside, took position, and started the gunfight,' he said, noting that the insurgents appeared to be holed up in one of the smaller camps within Camp Bastion.

At least five soldiers and 26 insurgents were killed on Friday at the base, Omar Zwak, a spokesman for Helmand's governor, said.

The Taliban, who were ousted from power by the U.S.-led coalition in 2001, claimed that hundreds had been killed in the attack. The insurgents routinely inflate casualty figures.

The attacks point to a still-potent Taliban insurgency, and raise concerns about whether Afghan security forces can control militants after the U.S. and NATO officially conclude their 13-year combat mission this year.

Afghanistan's Interior Ministry has launched a public awareness campaign to encourage Kabul residents to help prevent attacks, said its spokesman Sediq Sediqqi.

'We are requesting our people to cooperate with their security forces in identifying suspicious people in their areas and preventing terrorist attacks,' he said.
