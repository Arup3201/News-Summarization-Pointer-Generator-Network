She may have millions of dollars in the bank and a team of experts on hand to ensure she looks flawless 24/7 but Beyonce's make-up artist has revealed the secrets behind the singer's glow are easy to achieve at home and won't break the bank.

Sir John, who was Queen Bey's right hand man during her Mrs. Carter world tour and responsible for her dramatic new look for her latest album, has shared his tips for emulating the super star's glow.

Writing on Destination Iman, Sir John explains how he uses £32 Caudalie Beauty Elixir - a firm favourite of Karlie Kloss and Liv Tyler - and £5 Visine eye drops to combat fatigued skin.

'For shows, she lets me wing it, and we just go with it,' he says about creating Beyonce's tour look.

To get her pearlescent glow, Sir John buffs a few drops of Charlotte Tilbury’s Wonder Glow Illuminator (£38.50) onto the skin. 

To re-create her metallic eyes, he advises blending copper, silver, or bronze to the inner corners of the eyes and complimenting the look with a nude lip.

Speaking about transforming Beyonce for her new visual album, he explained that the duo were inspired by people in Rio De Janeiro and New Zealand while shooting and touring.

He said: 'Beyonce herself is my muse. Her passion 
for growth, not only as an artist, but as a human being, really pushed 
me to greater heights as well.'

Sir John, who also works with Joan Smalls and Jourdan Dunn, who appeared in her Yonce video, met Beyoncé backstage at Tom Ford’s spring 2011 show and hasn't looked back since.

Another member of Beyonce's glam squad, make-up artist Francesca Tolot, who met Beyonce in 2003 and created that sexy 
'wet look' for her smash hit Crazy In Love, also shared the singer's beauty secrets.

Speaking to Into The Gloss, Francesco revealed that the key to Mrs 
Carter's incredible glow on stage and camera is in fact just good old 
baby oil - a great tip for those who don't have a Beyonce-sized make-up 
budget.

Francesca says she works closely with the star to create her looks - opting for a much 
more pared-down, natural look for many of the videos for her new album.

She says: 'There isn't really a look she doesn’t like. She’s very smart—whatever we do is her project. It’s her.

Worldly inspiration: Sir John explained that the duo were inspired by the people of Rio De Janeiro and New Zealand while shooting and touring

'We
 stopped using lashes quite a few years ago, except for that look in the
 "Blow" video, when we went for a really ‘70s look. At one point I 
brought up the fact that I feel that false eyelashes are dated, unless 
you're going for the retro look. So I talked to her about that, and she 
totally agreed.’

Gushing 
about the star, who Francesca travels the world with, she said that 
Beyonce’s natural beauty means she actually requires very little 
make-up, and the hardest look she has ever created was making her ugly.

‘One of the hardest looks to do was for Cadillac Records when
 she looked so distressed. Can you imagine- somebody with perfect skin, 
beautiful almond-shaped eyes, very luminous and happy and full of joy—to
 make her look so bad?’
