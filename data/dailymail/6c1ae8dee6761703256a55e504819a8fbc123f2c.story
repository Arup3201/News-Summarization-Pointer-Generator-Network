Stoke held on to beat Arsenal 3-2 after a dramatic afternoon at the Britannia Stadium.  The result brought an end to Arsenal's run of three successive wins and ended a losing sequence of three for the hosts. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan rated the players' performances at the Britannia Stadium. 

Stoke (4-2-3-1)

Asmir Begovic - 6.5

Had next-to-nothing to do, but performed admirably when called upon. Made one super save from Danny Welbeck.

Phil Bardsley - 7.5

A real presence down the right hand side. Bundle of energy and has improved in an attacking sense.

Ryan Shawcross - 8

A game made for Shawcross. Olivier Giroud was reduced to moaning and bleating purely because he got no change out of the Stoke skipper. England calling?

Arsenal defender Callum Chambers was given a chasing and eventually sent of

Marc Muniesa - 7.5

Really like the look of the ex-Barcelona man. Never rash and is a keen reader of the game alongside the brute force of Shawcross.

Erik Pieters - 6

Did struggle against Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on occasion, but Arsenal didn’t get it wide nearly enough for this to become a contributive factor.

Steven Nzonzi - 8

Another immense performance in the middle of the park. Rough enough to put it about but also capable of switching play quickly.

Geoff Cameron - 7

Did his job in nullifying the Arsenal midfield, but didn’t have to work overly hard to do that. 

Bojan produced his best display in a red and white shirt since arriving from Barcelona

Mame Biram Diouf - 7.5

Becoming a bit of a handful for full backs nowadays. Tall enough to cause problems in the air and quick on the break.

Bojan - 8.5

Best display in a red and white shirt. Buzzed in behind Peter Crouch and showed just why those at Barcelona thought he’d take on the world. Inventive performance as he continues to grow into the Premier League.

Jon Walters - 8

Played wide right, where he began his career, and still has the turn of pace over three yards to make him a handful. Direct and knows exactly where strikers want balls in.

Peter Crouch - 8

Had the time of his life. Won most headers, as you’d expect, and linked up wonderfully with the home midfield. Won’t score an easier goal.

Jon Walters was moved out to the right and was a handful for Arsenal defence

Arsenal (4-2-3-1) 

Emiliano Martinez - 5

Somewhat unsurprisingly radiates zero confidence but this result wasn’t down to the goalkeeper. An unwitting bystander to the shambles in front of him.

Hector Bellerin - 5

Stumbled as Crouch put Stoke ahead, but got forward encouragingly. 

Calum Chambers - 3.5

Farcical defending for the opening goal - hadn’t woken up. Looked ruffled by Peter Crouch all afternoon. Was given a chasing and eventually sent off.

Arsenal's German international defender Per Mertesacker had an afternoon to forget

Per Mertesacker - 3

Looked in a daze from the word go. Strange performance, given the lack of Koscielny required the German to take charge. Abysmal.

Kieran Gibbs - 5

How can an international defender allow Jon Walters to consistently whip balls in from wide? Not good enough but wasn’t helped by the lack of talking to his right.

Mathieu Flamini - 5.5

Game passed him by, couldn’t get to grips with Steven Nzonzi’s physicality or Bojan dropping off into pockets. Decent drive for the penalty.

Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey failed to take control of the game

Aaron Ramsey - 6

Unsure whether he was playing or not. You can talk all you want about sub-plots, but the facts are that Ramsey failed to get hold of a game he should be bossing. Nice volley for the second goal, but wasn’t himself.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7

One bright spark for the Gunners. Mystifying why Arsene Wenger doesn’t give him a run in the side, but he may have to after this.

Alexis Sanchez - 7

His thinking is almost too quick for the rest; Sanchez cut a frustrated figure but individually played well.

Santi Cazorla - 6

Showed very little reason to suggest why Wenger keeps faith with him. Too cute, not enough bite in possession. Barely scored from the spot.

Olivier Giroud - 4

In a word: lazy. Not a focal point, missed an absolute sitter when one-down and didn’t appear to want to be here.

Subs

Danny Welbeck (for Bellerin - 46) - Showed his intent straight away and came closer than anyone had previously come to scoring. Summed the afternoon up. 6.5

Lukas Podolski (for Giroud - 63) - Didn’t really get himself involved. 5
