A fall off a faulty chair, taking a tumble on a wet floor, struggling to get in and out of a car and being bitten by a dog.

It might sound more like the plot for a comedy film - but in fact, these bizarre occurrences are some of the compensation claims made by a single police force to its officers in the last year. 

West Midlands Police had to fork out nearly £600,000 on personal injury claims brought by 26 officers.

The officers were successfully awarded compensation for a string of injuries, including a fall off a faulty chair, dog bites and one who was hit by a car park barrier. 

Another got a pay-out after he was clobbered by a colleague with a baton who was trying to break a car window with it. A further three officers were injured by their colleagues while on a job.  

The biggest claims relate to officers who tripped and fell at work. Three officers slipped on wet floors, two sustained injuries after moving furniture, one tripped in a 'dark corridor' and another tripped in a 'hole in the office floor'.

Somewhat ironically, three officers were also hurt during their personal safety training. 

Other payouts were for an officer suffering from an asbestos-related disease and one who developed stress from being exposed to HIV. 

In total, £328,100 was paid in compensation to officers, while a further £260,900 was handed out to lawyers dealing with the 26 cases.

Last year, it was revealed that a West Midlands officer received nearly £8,000 in compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work.  

In March this year, a Freedom of Information request found that police officers who suffered an injury at work had claimed as much as £85 million in compensation in the last five years. 

This included a £130,000 payout to one individual after he fell over and broke his hip in a store room while on duty. 

The other claims included one who received £16,610 for tripping over blankets while chasing a criminal, one who got £43,000 for a back injury after a slip on ice and another who was paid £8,130 for falling over some photocopy paper.

Critics denounced the figures and said that money on policing could be spent more usefully elsewhere.

West Midlands Police have made £126 million of cuts since 2010, and is expected to make £23 million of savings in the current financial year.

Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'These figures are shocking.

'Either the force is failing to deliver a safe working environment, or they're paying out on spurious claims, but either way it's taxpayers that end up footing the bill.

'Every penny spent on compensation is a penny that can't be spent on fighting crime and anti-social behaviour, and this pay-out culture cannot be allowed to continue.'

But Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Marcus Beale, defended the moneyspent on compensation claims.

He said: 'Police officers face dangerous situations on a daily basis while on duty, protecting people from harm.

'This is a fundamental nature of the job and a reality accepted by West Midlands Police officers and staff, whose health and safety we take extremely seriously.

'The force, together with unions and staff associations, have a robust joint delivery health and safety plan, which has led to a reduction in accidents involving officers of 7.5 per cent over the past year.

'We are responsible for our employees when they are on duty and when we fall short of meeting that responsibility, they are entitled to protection under the law and seek redress through the courts.

'Compensation payouts are only made following the assessment of appropriate medical evidence by our legal team, insurers and solicitors, who then make a recommendation to the force as to what payment should be made.'

Not all claims have however been successful or been pursued.

In September 2013, PC Kelly Jones, who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break-in, dropped her claim for damages.

Ms Jones faced controversy after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene.

She had filed against the owner of the Nun's Bridges Filling Station, claiming he failed to ensure she was 'reasonably safe' after responding to a reported burglary.

She allegedly fell and hurt her leg and wrist while checking the building in August 2012.
