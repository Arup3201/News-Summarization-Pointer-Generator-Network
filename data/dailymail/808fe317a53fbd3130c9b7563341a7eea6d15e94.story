Perhaps Australian porn star Angela White thought she was bringing the ultimate steamy study fantasy to life when she and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne.

The video is believed to have been shot this year, while the library was open for use and has sparked outrage from the university and the ire of police.

Despite the presence of nearby students, White starts the video by revealing herself between bookshelves, as reported by the Herald Sun.

White and her onscreen lover then move to nearby desks, with her partner keeping lookout.

A La Trobe University spokesman said it was shocked and appalled by the 'brazen act'.

'We knew nothing about the video footage until we were recently informed by some of our students.'Permission was not sought, nor would it have been given. If requested we would assist fully with any police investigation.'

A Victoria Police spokeswoman said if the pair were caught in the act, they could have faced charges including wilful and obscene exposure.
