The taxpayer is paying child benefit 
to 40,000 children who do not live in Britain at a cost of up to 
£36million a year, MailOnline can reveal.

The
astonishing bill run up by almost 24,000 families emerged as George 
Osborne presses ahead with a scheme to cut child benefit for higher 
earners in the UK.

The
reforms are expected to save £1.5billion a year, but Tory MPs are 
demanding the Chancellor end the payment to families overseas or risk an
angry backlash from voters.

George Osborne's plan to cut child benefit for higher rate taxpayers was already in trouble before today's revelation that millions are being paid to families who do not live in the UK

Under EU rules, the benefit has to be
paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying 
National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad.

According to figures unveiled in 
Parliament yesterday, there were 23,855 families claiming for 40,251 
children at the end of  last month.

Two-thirds of the children (25,623) 
are based in Poland. Payments were also made for 2,529 children in 
Ireland, 2,146 in France, 1,953 in Slovenia and 1,291 in Spain.

Child 
benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for 
every other child, regardless of parental income.

But from January, parents who earn 
£50,000 or more will see their benefit cut.

Any family where one parent 
earns more than £60,000 will lose child benefit all together.

Yet households where two parents are 
working and earn just under £50,000 each will keep their child benefits –
even though their combined income will be higher.

The reforms have triggered fury from 
Tory backbenchers who say they penalise families with stay-at-home 
parents.

Cutting benefits for middle-class earners is expected to save 
£1.5billion a year.

The Treasury has refused to say how 
much international child benefits totalled, but Tory MP Priti Patel, who
uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions, estimated it was
£36.6million.

Mrs Patel said: ‘Hard-pressed 
taxpayers will be appalled to see their pockets being pillaged to pay 
out millions of pounds in child benefit payments for children living in 
other parts of Europe.

‘This is deeply unfair and 
demonstrates yet again that some European immigrants are using crazy EU 
laws to get away with abusing our benefits system.

‘The Government must get these loopholes closed to protect hard-pressed families.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The 
payments can only be made while the parents are working in the UK and 
paying UK national insurance.

'Less than 0.5 per cent of child benefits 
payments are of this kind.’

Families were due to receive letters 
setting out the changes to higher earners, but HM Revenue and Customs 
could not find a simple way to explain them, so the letters have not 
been sent.

Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow 
Treasury minister, said: ‘With just a few weeks until hundreds of 
thousands of parents lose every penny of their child benefit, it’s 
becoming ever clearer that David Cameron and George Osborne simply 
haven’t thought this policy through.

‘And the chaotic way it is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this Government’s incompetence.’

A HMRC spokesman said: ‘It is wrong 
to suggest we are behind with letting people know about the child 
benefit changes. Our plans are firmly on course to contact affected 
taxpayers from next week.

‘The letters set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the January 7 rule change.’

Tory MP Priti Patel said the payment of child benefit to families overseas was 'deeply unfair'

The proportion of people deemed too sick or disabled to work has almost trebled after changes to controversial Government tests.

Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions yesterday reveal that 26 per cent of those tested for eligibility for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) in the first quarter of this year were considered to be too sick to work again.

When the testing process was introduced at the end of 2008, just 9 per cent were signed off as long-term sick.

The testing process has been hugely controversial with disability campaigners, who claim it is biased against the sick.

The DWP has changed the tests after losing thousands of appeals.

The latest figures will be seen as vindication for those campaigning for reform of the tests. But they will also raise doubts about the Government’s ability to curb the huge bill for out-of-work benefits.

Of the 191,000 people who applied for ESA, 65,000 abandoned their claims before being tested and 44,000 are being assessed.

Some 44,000 were deemed fit to work, with 21,000 signed off as long-term sick, and 17,000 offered training to help get back to work.
