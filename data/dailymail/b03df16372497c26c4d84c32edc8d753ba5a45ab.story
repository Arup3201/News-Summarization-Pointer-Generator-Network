The state of Georgia is attempting to fast track the executions of death row prisoners before its supply of the drug it uses in lethal injections expires.

Yesterday the southern state administered a lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital to Andrew Allen Cook, 38, who had confessed to the killing of two college students to his FBI agent father.

They are now trying to rush through the execution of mentally disabled Warren Lee Hill who beat death of a fellow inmate to death in 1999 while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend.

Drug shortage: The death chamber at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia. The state's entire supply of lethal injection drugs will expire on March 1

Georgia's entire supply of pentobarbital will expire on March 1, at which point they will have no way of executing the 94 prisoners they have on death row.

With some drug companies going out of business and others unwilling to become accomplices in executions, U.S. states which practise the death penalty are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain supplies of lethal-injection drugs.

Hurry: The attorney general is now trying to push through the execution of inmate Warren Hill despite claims he is mentally disabled

This has reportedly led to a marked 
decrease in the number of executions in recent years with some states 
now looking to India to source the drugs.

In
1999, the European commission imposed restrictions on the export of 
medicines to all US corrections departments following unilateral action 
by the UK.

Danish firm Lundbeck, One of the leading manufacturers of pentobarbital, has introduced tough new measures to stop the drug falling into the hands of U.S. executioners.

Last year, several U.S. states including Georgia were found to have been buying lethal injection drugs through a shady unlicensed company in London that was being run from the back of a driving school.

Cook's was Georgia's first execution since the state switched its procedure from using a three-drug combination to a single dose of pentobarbital.

They had been forced to make the change after Hospira, the only US manufacturer of sodium thiopental - a key ingredient of the lethal cocktail, ceased production in 2011.

Hill's death warrant runs until 26 February, but he was granted a stay of execution after the courts discovered pentobarbital was being ordered by the corrections department without a doctor's prescription.

Now Georgia's attorney general is scrambling to have the stay of execution overturned so sentence can be carried out before the warrant expires.

But his hands are further tied by the fact widespread condemnation of Hill's sentence due to his mental disability, which resulted in a federal appeal court blocking the execution to allow time to consider the issue.

Georgia appealed to the US Supreme Court to overturn the decision but was denied.

Anti-death penalty campaigners have condemned the apparent hurry to administer the punishments before the drugs expire.

Sara Totonchi, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights told the Guardian:'This highlights the nastiness of the process that the AG should be racing to kill prisoners ahead of an expiration date.'

The state of Georgia confirmed to the Guardian newspaper that its entire supply of pentobarbital expires on 1 March.

However a spokesman for the department of corrections said they were confident of being 'able to obtain sufficient supplies of the drugs necessary to carry out the court ordered lethal injection process'.
