The Californian woman sentenced to four years in prison for 
planting a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili is going back 
behind bars for two more years, this time for lying about a shooting 
involving her son.

Anna Ayala, 47, pleaded no contest to three felony charges and will 
receive a two-year prison term when formally sentenced in September, The San Jose Mercury News reported today.

The so-called Chili Finger Lady was arrested in October after she 
told police that her son had been shot in the ankle by two men.

The infamous 'chili finger lady' Anna Ayala (left) made up a story to protect her son Junior Reyes (right) who was found with a gunshot wound despite not being allowed to own a gun due to being on parole

Her son, Guadalupe Reyes, 
accidentally shot himself with a gun he wasn't supposed to have, because
he was on parole for a felony burglary conviction.

Ayala lied to prevent 
him from going to prison as a felon in possession of a firearm.

Reyes 
will also receive two years in prison for that very charge.

Ayala invented detailed reports of two men who 'shot' her 26-year-old son outside their home in San Jose, California.

Junior Reyes told them that he had
been attacked by a pair of men for 'for no rhyme or reason.'

After she and her son got their tales mixed up, police arrested them both in February.

Ayala was charged with being an 
accessory to a felony and filing a false police report.

The mother, who has a long history of filing lawsuits, was released from prison after serving four years for the gruesome Wendy's chili finger case in 2005.

The bizarre scam gathered 
worldwide attention after Ayala dropped the 1 1/2 inch section of ring 
finger in her bowl of fast-food chili.

Bizarre hoax: Anna Ayala and her husband, Jaime Plascencia, were jailed in 2005 after cooking up a scheme to plant a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili to extort money from the fast food chain

It was revealed Ayala's husband, Jaime Plascencia, had bought the digit for $100 from a co-worker who lost it in an accident. He then took it home where Ayala cooked it before depositing it in her meal on March 24, 2005.

Wendy's claimed they lost $21 million in business because of the bogus allegations.

In her most recent allegations, the mom said one of the attackers 
wore a black Oakland A's cap and Air Jordan sneakers, while his 
accomplice was a big man with a goatee and abnormally large ears who 
rode a black bicycle.

Ayala even gave a name for the 
supposed attacker. But when authorities found a match for the supposed 
suspect, they quickly ruled the man out of the accusations.

'I don't know if it was someone she 
knew who she described or how she came up with the description,' said 
Santa Clara County prosecutor Bret Wasley.

When officers went back to question 
mother and son, Wasley said that 'She backed off from her statements' 
while 'Junior changed his story into something unbelievable about him 
chasing after a dog.'

On her Facebook page 'about' section Ayala describes herself as 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook... (finger lady )'

San Jose police Detective Nathaniel Braxton then confronted Reyes with the theory that the pair had made up the whole story as he wasn't supposed to even own a gun.

'I told Reyes that shooting yourself in the foot is not a crime, it's an accident, but making a false report is a crime,' reports the Mercury News.

'Yea,' said Reyes, according to the report. 'I shot myself.'

But when Braxton asked his mother about the new information she told him: 'I don't know nothing.'

Braxton said that he 'reminded Ayala that she went to prison for doing the same thing before' and asked her where the gun was.

She replied 'There's no gun no more, 
it's done, thrown away' before telling police she had returned the 
firearm to an unidentified friend.

'Ayala's statement confirms Reyes shot himself and she admitted to getting rid of the evidence,' reads the report.

According to the detective's report, 'Ayala's final statement was, 'I'm not going back to prison for something that has nothing to do with me.'

Ayala appeared contrite after her release from prison, telling CBS that she had faced ridicule in jail for her part in the scam and that 'I learned my lesson and I just want to move on with my life.'

The 'chili finger lady' was convicted in 2005 and released for good behavior in 2009

In 2005, the Associated Press revealed that even before the chili finger episode, Ayala had been involved in at least half a dozen legal battles in the San Francisco Bay area.

She brought a suit against an ex-boss in 1998 for sexual harassment and sued an auto dealership in 2000, alleging the wheel fell off her car. That suit was dismissed after Ayala fired her lawyer, who said she had threatened him.

The case against her former employer was settled in arbitration in June 2002, but it was not known whether she received any money.

Ayala acknowledged, however, that her family received a settlement for their medical expenses about a year ago after reporting that her daughter, Genesis, got sick from food at an El Pollo Loco restaurant in Las Vegas. She declined to provide any further details.
