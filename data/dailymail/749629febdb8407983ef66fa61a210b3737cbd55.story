A sea of bright red surrounds the Tower of London in a stunning new aerial photo displaying the commemorative poppies that have filled its moat.

The massive art installation of more than 800,000 ceramic poppies - each representing a British life lost during World War One - is nearing completion thanks to the efforts of volunteers.

The incredible picture was taken by the Met Police’s helicopter and posted yesterday on it official Twitter account. The moat filled with 888,256 ceramic poppies will remain in place until November.

Its aim is to create a visual commemoration for the First World War Centenary. The poppies will then be sold.

The creation is the work of ceramic artist Paul Cummins and stage designer Tom Piper though there have been concerns that not enough of the money raised by the project will go to charity.

Hard work: Hundreds of volunteers, working in two shifts per day, have nearly finished placing all the 888,256 poppies, which will remain in place until November

Remembrance: Each of the poppies represents a British life lost during the First World War, as the centenary of the conflict is marked this year 

Artistic: The creation is the work of ceramic artist Paul Cummins and stage designer Tom Piper. Afterwards all the poppies will be sold, with some money going to charity
