Aljaz Bedene is hoping to be granted British citizenship this week, and has his sights set on representing his adopted country at the Davis Cup in March.

It emerged last year that the Slovenian, who has lived in Britain since 2008, was intending to switch nationalities.

But his hopes of playing Davis Cup for Britain appeared to have been scuppered by a change in the rules to prevent players representing two different countries that came into force at the start of 2015.

Aljaz Bedene is hoping to be granted British citizenship this week ahead of the Davis Cup in March 

Bedene had not expected to complete the citizenship process until next month but he rushed through it and sent off all his paperwork in time.

Provided the 25-year-old, who is through to the second round of the Chennai Open, is successful in his application, he would be eligible for Britain's Davis Cup World Group first-round match against the United States in Glasgow in March.

Bedene said: 'I gave all the papers to the Home Office and I'm waiting for their response. It's quite an exciting period for me now.

'Although I'm at the tournament and I don't want to think too much about this, it would be really nice to get approval from the Home Office that I can be a citizen of the UK. 

If Bedene is successful, he would become British number three behind Andy Murray (above) and James Ward

'My solicitor is taking care of it and it should be in the next couple of days I think.

'I had to rush with the life in the UK test and English exam because of the new ITF rules but I'm still positive, I think it will be all right.'

With a ranking of 156, Bedene would become the British number three behind Andy Murray and James Ward.

But he has been ranked as highly as 71 and his current standing is a reflection of 18 months of injury problems.

The option of selecting Bedene would be a welcome one for Davis Cup captain Leon Smith, who has long bemoaned the lack of strength in depth available to him.

But the Scot will be aware it is a divisive issue and, given Ward's good form in 2014 in Davis Cup and other tournaments, it would be a huge shock if he was not named as the number two singles player behind Murray against the US.

Bedene - who played three matches for Slovenia between 2010 and 2012, all in dead rubbers - said: 'I'm in contact with Leon and he's also excited to hear the news. We're all hoping it goes through.'

Bedene made a fine start to the new season by coming through qualifying in Chennai before beating 88th-ranked Lukas Lacko on Tuesday to set up a second-round match against Feliciano Lopez.

From India, he heads to Melbourne where he will play in Australian Open qualifying, and he is optimistic a better season lies ahead.

He said: 'It's great to start the season with qualies and a first-round win, especially against a top-100 player. I'm satisfied with my performances so far and I'm looking forward to the next match.

'I'm looking forward to playing a full season finally. I want to show that I'm much better than the ranking shows.'
