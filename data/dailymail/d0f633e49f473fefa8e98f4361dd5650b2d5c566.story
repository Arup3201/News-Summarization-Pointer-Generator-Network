A Texas teenager who suffered serious head injuries at a gymnastics class is starting to make progress a week after doctors said he had only a 50/50 chance of survival.

Blake Hyland was learning a new move, which involved performing jumping from a spring board and twisting in the air, when he landed badly at a Waco gym on February 18.

The 14-year-old is said to have hit his head with the same force as a high-speed car crash, and had to be put in a medically induced coma.

But Blake's parents, Pat and Cindy Hyland, say he has started to respond and doctors have started to move him off a ventilator that has been helping the teenager breathe.

Blake was rushed to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco where surgeons removed part of his skull because of bleeding and swelling on the brain.

He was then moved to Cook Children's Hospital, where he has been kept sedated while his body recovers.

'The doctors there went above and 
beyond. And if they did not do that the doctors here at Cook Children's 
said that Blake would not have survived,' Mr Hyland told NBC5.

After being given only a 50/50 chance of survival, Blake is now able to move his left arm and leg, and squeeze his doctor's finger on request.

Family friend David Stringer told KWTX: 'They said most people donâ€™t wake up from this type of injury, and left it by saying it would take a miracle for Blake to come out of it.

The athletic teenager received his injuries while practicing a new move at his power tumbling class.

'There was a pad on the side, but his 
side hit it. Then his head came down and there was no pad on the concrete and his 
head hit concrete,' Mr Hyland said.

Blake's family and friends have set up a Prayers for Blake Hyland Facebook page, which has updates on his progress and a fund to help with costs.

The page has attracted support from across the world, with hundreds of people sending messages of goodwill, and the University of Kentucky tumbling team and UK GymKatz posting pictures of themselves holding up signs saying 'Pray for Blake'.

Mrs Hyland described the outpouring of support for her son as overwhelming. The family's Facebook page has attracted more than 8.400 likes.
