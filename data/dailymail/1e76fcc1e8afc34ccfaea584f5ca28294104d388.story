Now this is how you guarantee that your guests have a memorable hotel stay.

When one guest checked in to the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk during a business trip to Texas, the bored traveller decided to have a little fun with the hotel staff.

Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz received a text, which she believed to be automated, when she first arrived, asking if she needed anything during her stay.

Business traveller Sarah Kovacz Grzywacz asked hotel concierge for an image of Nicolas Cage for her room

Bored during her business conference, Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz responded to the hotel's text - with one particularly odd request.

'I got this text when I checked into the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk basically letting me know if I needed anything,' Grzywacz explained to Viral Nova.

'I asked for a framed picture of Nic Cage in Con Air. When I got an affirmative response, I thought it was auto generated and went about my day.'  

After the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk staff obliged, Grzywacz continued their interaction, asking for another photo of Nic (along with bath towels) to be placed in the bathroom

When she arrived home around 6pm, sadly, no photograph of the Hollywood actor had been delivered

But hotel concierge Ramon delivered on his promise and delivered a film still of the actor along with a Post-It note that read, 'Sweet dreams! Enjoy!'

Amused, Grzywacz made another strange request. 

This time, she asked for a photo of the actor in Moonstruck to be attached to her bathroom mirror. She also asked for some bath towels.

But the dedicated staff delivered the requested image and towels soon after - along with a personalised note

Her final request? An image of Nic Cage in his hit film 8MM to be attached next to the television

The hotel staff once again delivered - taping a printed out photo of the actor to the side of the TV

When she returned back at 8pm and found that her request had not been completed, she sent a follow up text.

The hotel staff was apologetic and quickly delivered her towels, along with a photo of the star and a note that said: 'Sorry I'm late! - Nick.'

For her last trick, Grzywacz asked for one final image of the Hollywood actor to be delivered to her room - a photo of the actor in 8MM to be taped to the television screen.

'Good choice!' Ramon replied and the image soon appeared in her hotel room.  

Grzywacz then uploaded these hilarious images and texts on Imgur, which have since gone viral

A little something extra! The concierge even attached one final - non-requested - image to the door

Grzywacz went on to share the photos of the attentive staff's dedication on her Imgur account, which have since gone viral.

While many hotels offer services of concierges who claim to be willing to do whatever it takes, Ramon's hilarious responses show an entirely new level of commitment to ensuring guest satisfaction.

Consider us booked in.
