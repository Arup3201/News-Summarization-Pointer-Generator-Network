A Connecticut woman is celebrating a big milestone - her 110th birthday.

There weren't quite that many candles on Emily Tremonti's cake Saturday at the elder residence where she lives in Fairfield but she was surrounded by many people who love her.

Great-great-niece Mary-Kate Mele says her Aunt 'Em' didn't have children but has three nieces, six great-nephews and nieces, seven great-great-nieces and three great-great-great nephews and nieces.

Tremonti grew up with four sisters in Mount Vernon, New York - one of whom lived to 100. 

Their parents were Italian immigrants and Tremonti cherishes her heritage.

Mele says Tremonti later lived in Bronxville, New York, worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and married Joseph Tremonti, a Con Edison executive, in 1933.

According to the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), the oldest super-centenarian - a person who is at least the age of 110 - whose age can be validated is 116-year-old Misao Okawa from Japan.

Okawa's date of birth is March 5, 1898, and she also leads among women included in the GRG's list of validated super-centenarians, as of September 1, 2014.

The oldest male super centenarian on the list  is 111-year-old Sakari Momoi, also from Japan.

His date of birth is February 5, 1903, according to the group.
