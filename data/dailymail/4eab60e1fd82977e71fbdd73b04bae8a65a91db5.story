Liverpool are giving serious consideration to making a move for Chelsea defender Ryan Bertrand as Brendan Rodgers attempts to fill the club’s troublesome left-back position. 

Bertrand is ready to leave Stamford Bridge this summer in search of regular first-team football after nine years with the club. 

Liverpool manager Rodgers is a long-term admirer of Bertrand after working with him previously at the Chelsea academy and the 24-year-old has emerged as a serious alternative to Sevilla’s Alberto Moreno.

Solution: Liverpool are considering making a bid for Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand

Problem position: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has struggled to fill his left-back role

The Spanish left-back was one Rodgers’ principal targets at the beginning of the summer but Liverpool are reluctant to meet Sevilla’s asking price, after they demanded a deal in excess of £20million for the 21-year-old defender. 

Bertrand, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, would be rather more affordable at around £8m and the player is understood to be keen on a move to a club playing Champions League football.  

Liverpool endured major difficulties at left-back last season following the injury to Jose Enrique and the disappointing form of Aly Cissokho, although John Flanagan did impress in the final few months of the season. 

Rodgers will also step up his pursuit of Southampton’s Croatian defender Dejan Lovren, with a £15m bid expected to be lodged in the coming weeks.
