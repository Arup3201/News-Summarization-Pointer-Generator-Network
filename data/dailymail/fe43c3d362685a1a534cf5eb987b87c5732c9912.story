It is a dream for any golf fanatic: your own nine-hole course, laid out over almost 25 acres, with a clubhouse and apartment thrown in.

Now the dream could come true at The Waterbridge Golf Course, near Crediton in Devon, which is on the market.

Strangely, the couple who bought the complex 12 years ago were not golf nuts. Gary Wren, 56, played only when the sun came out and his wife Angela, 52, had only ever tried pitch and putt.

They bought the club as another adventure in their property-owning career.

At the time, the couple owned four houses and four flats, which they managed as rentals but were looking for something less stressful.

Running a small country golf club, they felt, would suit them to a tee – despite their complete lack of experience. Angela recalls: ‘Gary said to me, “We could afford to buy that”. We’d been wondering what to do next and it sounded a good idea.’

In 2001, the couple bought the club for £195,000 and started learning all about golf course management.

They quickly found that keeping the course in pristine condition was tougher than it looked. Gary, used to trimming a suburban lawn, found himself mowing the greens almost daily and the rest of the course weekly during the spring and summer.

‘It was much more like hard work than I was expecting,’ he says. With just a mobile home on site, the family continued living in their Thirties bungalow in Exeter, and the long working days – starting at 7am and lasting until nightfall, seven days a week – soon took their toll.

Once planning permission was granted for a proper clubhouse with a three-bedroom apartment above, they decided to sell up in Exeter and move on to the course. In January 2003, they started building their new home. It took four months to complete the New England-style property, rendered in white and surrounded by a veranda. The mansard windows on the first floor offer marvellous views across the course and farmland beyond.

In 2006, they extended, adding a double garage and self-contained one-bedroom flat for their son Chris, 32, who helps run the business. The work cost about £200,000, and today the property measures 3,862  sq ft.

The couple’s other son, Nicholas, 29, who is in the building industry, also lives with them. Although they love their home, Gary and Angela have long harboured an ambition to renovate a farmhouse in France and they have decided to sell the course for £975,000 so they can head off on another adventure.

The golf club was first put on the market last May at £1.45 million – but the couple realised this was unrealistic in such a stagnant property market. The annual turnover is about £100,000 and running costs, excluding staff, are about £38,000.

A new owner could either continue running the complex as a business or opt to keep it to themselves to work on their handicap in privacy.
