The world-famous doctor who caught David Letterman's deadly heart condition helped save the life of another New Yorker this March.

Parking garage attendant Errol Mair, 66, was working the early shift at the Capital Parking lot at 470 E 63 Street when he felt a sudden jolt in his left arm.

'I was saying to myself, "Oh my God, I got a stroke,"' Mair told DNAinfo. 'And I was thinking about my kids.'

He called for a co-worker, who put him in a chair and then ran to call the manager and 911.

'His eyes started rolling back and his arm went limp,' co-worker Elease Arnold said. 

When the ambulance didn't arrive after 10 minutes, parking lot manager Eurold Principale ran out onto the street where he ran into Dr Louis Aronne, a regular customer.

Dr Aronne is an internationally-recognized expert on obesity and an internist who works at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell hospital and helped spot David Letterman's life-threatening heart condition in 2000.

Dr Aronne knew Mair and had just seen him that morning doing fine. He saw the manager running down the street and asked what was wrong and if he could help.

When he saw Mair in the chair, half of his face going limp, he knew that the man was having a stroke and needed to get the hospital right away.

Instead of wait longer for the ambulance to arrive, he had another parking attendant bring his car around so he could rush Mair to the hospital himself.

'I felt we had to get him there as quickly as possible,' Dr Aronne said. 'We couldn’t take the chance that the ambulance would take more time. Every minute counts in that situation.'

Dr Aronne drove Mair to Weill Cornell's emergency room just a few blocks away where ER doctors dissolved the clot with special medication.

Dr Athos Patsalides says it was Dr Aronne's quick thinking that helped save Mair's life and limit the damage of the stroke.

'The treatments for stroke are effective only if they are done in the first three hours,' he said. 'If the same treatment is done at two hours and 10 hours, it will have completely different results.'

Two months later, Mair is still recovering at home with his wife and four kids but is doing fine except for some weakness in his left arm.

He's still not sure if he's return to work, but the customers are constantly asking after the well-liked attendant.

'The customers all ask how he's doing, if he's coming back,' Arnold said. 'They all look for him in the morning.'

Mair told the New York Post that he appreciates the ER doctors, but is especially grateful to Dr Aronne for all of is help.
