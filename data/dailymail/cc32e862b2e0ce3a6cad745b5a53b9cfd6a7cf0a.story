Two volunteers including an Australian nurse have been airlifted back to the UK after potentially coming into contact with the Ebola virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone. 

Public Health England has described the decision to bring the two volunteers to the UK as a 'highly precautionary step'. 

Neither of the patients have been diagnosed with the deadly virus or are showing any symptoms of the disease.

Public Health England said the nurse's protective equipment was damaged prompting her evacuation

The Australian nurse was flown back to the UK on an RAF flight while the second volunteer, who worked for a non-governmental organisation, is being returned on a private aircraft chartered by their employer. 

It is understood the nurse's protective clothing was punctured while in an Ebola hot-spot, but she is not believed to have come into direct contact with the virus. 

The second person, who is employed by a non-governmental organisation, was in contact with a health care worker who developed the disease.  

The pair will remain in isolation for the disease's 21-day incubation period. 

Dr Jenny Harries, regional director for PHE, said: 'The risk to the public posed by these and indeed any of the returning workers is extremely low. We are confident that all appropriate public health actions have been taken, and will continue to be taken, to support these individuals and to protect the public's health.

'It's important to remember, in choosing to volunteer, that these individuals have taken a courageous step not only to help those affected in West Africa, but also prevent the spread of Ebola any wider.'

Meanwhile a patient admitted to hospital in Scotland yesterday after returning from Ebola-hit west Africa has tested negative for the killer virus.

NHS Lothian said the patient, reported to be a woman, was screened for infection at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital after reporting a raised temperature, but tested negative.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said the Australian nurse will undergo observation in the United Kingdom following a 'low risk clinical incident' at the Australian-managed Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Sierra Leone.

In a statement it said: 'The nurse was transferred to the United Kingdom consistent with the guarantees secured by the Australian government as a condition to establishing the treatment centre.

'The individual, who for privacy reasons has not been named, has not been diagnosed with Ebola, and her transferral to the UK for a 21-day observation period is a precautionary step.

'The Australian-funded ETC has strict infection prevention protocols in place, and the safety of staff and patients is paramount.'

The ETC has a capacity of 38 beds and has so far seen 18 patients recover from the disease.

A total of 825 health-care workers have been infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone

Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey is still being treated for Ebola at London's Royal Free Hospital.

The volunteer from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, is in a stable condition after being taken off the critical list this week.

She remains in an isolation unit after contracting the disease while helping patients in Sierra Leone with Save the Children.

The charity is investigating how Ms Cafferkey came to be infected.

Following the latest incident the Scottish Government said: 'Scotland has a robust health protection surveillance system which monitors global disease outbreaks and ensures that we are fully prepared to respond to such situations.'

A PHE spokesman said: 'It is important to remember that the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person.

'We have advised all front-line medical practitioners and NHS call handlers to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas and following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing.'

It is believed the Australian nurse was evacuated after she may have 'accidentally breached' clinical protocols.  

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed that the nurse was airlifted from the Aspen Medical clinic at Hastings Airfield to the UK where she will undergo observation, but assured that the 'clinical incident' was one of 'low risk'.

'The individual, who for privacy reasons has not been named, has not been diagnosed with Ebola, and the transferral to the UK for a 21-day observation period is a precautionary step,' Ms Bishop said.

'The Australian-funded ETC has strict infection prevention protocols in place, and the safety of staff and patients is paramount.'

Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, who visited the centre late last year, issued the following tweet after learning of the incident: 'My thoughts are with the Australian nurse evacuated from Sierra Leone after accidently breaching protocol. Hopefully nothing will come of it.'

Although built by the UK, the Australian government have provided $23 million in funding to the treatment centre which is run by private Australian company Aspen.

It currently holds 38 beds and is preparing to upgrade to a capacity of 50 by February.

At least 57 patients have now been treated at the centre, 18 of whom have recovered and 22 of whom have died, the ABC reports.

On January 6, the centre announced that they had successfully treated their first three survivors of the deadly virus, including an 11 year old girl, a man in his 20s and a 67 year old woman.

'Ms Aminata Bangura, 11 years old, was the first patient to be successfully treated by the Aspen Medical team,' the centre wrote in a statement.

'She has lost several family members to EVD. Aminata spent a total of eight days in the centre. Once diagnosed with EVD she received immediate life-saving treatment which involved antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs. A key aspect of her recovery was emotional support.'

It went on say: 'The usual fatality rate for those over 45 years of age is 95 per cent, that we have been able to successfully treat a 67 year old woman is a very positive sign, operationally and clinically.'

The clinic has now set up a 'wall of hope' for survivors to add their hand-prints before being discharged.

More than 8,400 people have died after contracting Ebola across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation.

'A total of 825 health-care worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 493 reported deaths,' WHO reports.
