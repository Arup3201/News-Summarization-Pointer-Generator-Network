New York City police officer Juan Pichardo smiled broadly as he was wheeled out of a Bronx hospital Saturday, less than 48 hours after he was shot while trying to stop a robbery.

Pichardo, 34, took a bullet in the leg at his family's car dealership Thursday night after two armed men walked inside and demanded cash.

The nine-year NYPD veteran, who was off-duty at the time and did not have his service weapon, wrestled one of the gunmen and was shot in the thigh. The other suspect escaped.

Despite his injury, Pichardo and a co-worker were able to subdue the alleged perpetrator until police arrived. His suspected accomplice was arrested a short time later along with two others, NY1 reported.

On Saturday, some 100 of Pichardo's uniform-clad colleagues cheered outside Jacobi Medical Center and applauded his bravery as bagpipes blared in the background.

'I'm feeling good,' Pichardo told the New York Daily News as he got out of the wheelchair and hopped to a waiting SUV to return home to his wife and three children.

Three of the four suspects in the Pichardo shooting — Jeffrey Okine, 22; Marquis Daniels, 23; and Tyquez Harrell, 22 — were arraigned Friday on charges of attempted murder, assault and robbery.

The fourth suspect, Rayshaun Jones, 25, was still awaiting arraignment on the same charges.

The incident that left Pichardo wounded happened Thursday evening when he was helping out at his family's car dealership on Boston Road.

According to police, at around 6.30pm, two men walked into the store and pretended to be interested in one of the vehicle. A short time later, one of the suspects, Jeffrey Okine, pulled out a Bryco .380 handgun and demanded cash.

Although Pichardo was unarmed at the time, he confronted the gunman and wrestled him to the ground, getting shot in the process.

The 34-year-old cop and a co-worker managed to hold down the shooter and wait for officers to arrive. Meanwhile, his alleged accomplice fled in a white Impala with Oregon license plates that carried two other men.

Weapon: The Bryco .380 handgun that was used in the shooting was stolen from North Carolina last month

According to police, Pichardo had recognized Okine as a member of a stickup crew in the Bronx. His Bryco firearm had been reported stolen from North Carolina in December, CBS New York reported.  

In an unrelated incident, two other NYPD officers in plainclothes were shot about an hour later at the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway stop in Brooklyn about an N train by an armed man, identified as 37-year-old Peter Jourdan.

Officer Michael Levay, 27, was shot in his lower back from a 9mm Taurus handgun, but was protected by his bulletproof vest. He was able to return fire and killed the gunman, who landed with his feet on the platform and his body on the train..

His partner, officer Lukasz Kozicki, 32, sustained injuries to his thighs and groin. A passenger in the subway car suffered a graze wound in the leg, he said.

Both injured cops were released Friday afternoon from Lutheran Medical Center.
