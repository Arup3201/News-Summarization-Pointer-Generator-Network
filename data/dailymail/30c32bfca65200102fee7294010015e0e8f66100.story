Investigation: Jane Jackson, pictured, allegedly wedged the door closed with a mop as she enjoyed a tryst with the category A inmate at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes - dubbed 'Britain's Alcatraz'

A blonde nurse accused of romping with a dangerous prisoner admitted today that she had smuggled deodorant and shower gel into the prison for him.

Jane Jackson said she only did it ‘to shut
him up’ after he had pestered her to bring him toiletries because he 
was short of money and his family lived far away. 

‘I
was in the treatment room and he came up to the door and said ‘Jane, 
can you please get me some toiletries”, she told a hearing.

‘I said I couldn’t possibly do that because I would get into lots of trouble.

‘It went over and over in my head, and very stupidly I bought toiletries in just to shut him up.

‘It was absolutely wrong but I did it.’

Jackson allegedly wedged a door closed with a mop as she enjoyed a tryst with the category A inmate at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes - dubbed ‘Britain’s Alcatraz’.

When a colleague burst into the room, Jackson was found hiding behind the door stripped to the waist clutching her bra and top, a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing was told.

But Jackson denied she was completely topless when caught locked in the room and said she was ‘shocked’ at the situation she found herself in. 

She revealed today that she only took her work tunic off after he demanded access to her treatment room.

‘Prisoner A came to the door and he just gave me this look’, she said.

‘He said 'let me into the treatment room', he had this horrible look on his face.

‘I just froze and panicked, then opened the door.

‘He came in and said close the door with the mop.’ 

Prison guard Rebecca Langley had burst in on Jackson and prisoner A on February 7, 2009, after reports the two were in the treatment room alone, in breach of strict guidelines.

Jackson was under surveillance suspected of having an affair with a prisoner in the days before the incident, the hearing has been told.

Ms Langley said Jackson was topless hiding behind the door.

But Jackson claims she had only 
removed her work tunic during the incident and was stood on the other 
side of the room to prisoner A.

‘I was in shock, I felt disgraced’, she said.

‘I just felt awful, was crying, and I couldn’t believe what had happened to me.

‘I was so distressed at that time and I wanted some support. 

‘I wanted someone to dig a hole and bury me, I was so disgusted at what had happened.’

Jackson had worked as a nurse at the category A prison in Milton Keynes since January 2009.

She was taken to the governor’s office following the incident, and escorted off the premises that afternoon.

Prisoner
A and Jackson had talked regularly in the months leading up to the 
incident, as he worked at the laundry in the prison block close to the 
treatment room.

Following her suspension, the 
contraband deodorant and shower gel were found in prisoner A’s cell 
which Jackson confessed to smuggling into the prison in a rucksack. 

Jackson was sacked by Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust, which provided health care to the prison, on July 9, 2009.

She
had complained of a prison officer harassing her before her dismissal, 
she told the hearing, and today accused prison officers of being ‘on a 
power trip’ when handling prisoners.

‘The
prisoners would come up to me and say ‘oh, I’ve got a headache’, but 
the prisoner officer would just say he’s pulling your leg’, she said.

‘Sometimes, the way prison officers spoke to prisoners felt pretty rubbish.

‘I can take a joke and have a laugh with people, but I felt at times they made me feel so stupid in front of prisoners.’

Jackson has admitted unhooking her security keys from her belt while along in the room with prisoner A, in breach of regulations.

But she denies that she left the controlled drug cabinet open during the incident.

The hearing into her alleged conduct continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
