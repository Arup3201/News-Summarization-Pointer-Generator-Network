The puppet master: Lena Dunham, 26, wrote, produced, directed and stars in Girls

Awkward sex scenes. Size 12 bodies. Spanx. Naked cake-eating. Uncomfortable jokes about sexually transmitted diseases. Described as 'a show for smart people'.

This certainly ain't Friends.

This is Girls, the new hit comedy series about a group of four 'real' twenty-something female friends living in New York.

(So it's obviously not Sex And The City, either).

It has proved an unequivocal - and deliciously controversial - smash hit across America since its April premiere.

And now it is finally coming to Britain.

Lena Dunham is the 26-year-old creative whizz-kid behind (and, as it happens, in the front of) HBO's groundbreaking new show.

Not only did she write, produce and direct Girls - with the executive production assistance of Judd Apatow - she also stars in it as protagonist Hannah Horvath.

Describing her show, Dunham says: 'I always thought the saddest feeling in life is when you're dancing in a really joyful way and then you hit your head on something.

'It's sad and embarrassing and I feel like Hannah's entire life is like dancing and then hitting her head on something.'

Dunham - who has just signed a publishing deal worth over $3.5million (£2.2million) with Random House for her first book, and who appeared in the opening sketch for this year's Emmys sitting naked on a loo, eating cake - received initial hostility from some critics.

They complained she appeared naked too much in the comedy - particularly for someone who, they felt, did not fit the standard Hollywood 'size zero' mould.

Speaking to The Times' Caitlin Moran on the Girls set in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Dunham explained that her motives for such a wealth of scantily clad dancing scenes are 'varied'.

She said: 'There's a part of me that 
goes, "You think I'm chubby? Well, LOOK AT ME NAKED." Then there's also 
sometimes some feeling of rage. Where it would be fine for you to do it 
if you had a more traditional body – but you don't, so you shouldn't. 
Like fat girls should know to keep their clothes on..

But
Dunham confesses that she never intended Girls to be so keenly focused 
on the idea of a 'normal', healthy-looking woman: 'It’s funny, because 
it didn't come out exactly the way I saw it in my head.

'When
I imagine myself walking down the street, and then see footage of 
myself walking down the street, it doesn't look the same.

'In
my brain, I've always been ten notches more classically beautiful than I
am. In my brain, I've always been really gorgeous – and they just don’t
get it yet.

'There was a certain amount of… deluding myself.'

Dunham wrote and directed her first feature, Tiny Furniture, in 2010, aged 24.

Girls begins on Monday, 22 October 22, on Sky Atlantic at 10pm.
