Ronald Koeman walked into Anfield’s Press auditorium, looking completely deflated. After a summer of turmoil on the South Coast, he had to fulfil the duty — explaining a Southampton defeat — which many would have expected after his first game in charge.

His deflation, though, had nothing to do with the hand that he had been dealt. There was no complaint about his club’s board or the absence of those influential former players who were sold for a king’s ransom this summer.

No. Koeman was miserable because his team had to make the long journey home with nothing to show for their impressive efforts; their performance, full of spirit and tenacity, rattled a disjointed Liverpool and should have yielded at least a point.

Level: Clyne equalised for Southampton, and Koeman says his side played most of the football afterwards

Such has been the seismic change at St Mary’s, with five players leaving, a manager departing and a chairman quitting, that the vast majority of predictions in pre-season involved Southampton being included in the three names who will tumble out of the top flight next May.

Koeman, however, does not subscribe to the opinion that relegation is a certainty — ‘have a bet with me about that and you will lose,’ he said before this trip to Merseyside — and nor should he on the basis of this effort.

‘Always there is one end to all of those stories,’ said Koeman, as he reflected on the sucker-punch goal from Daniel Sturridge that clinched Liverpool’s victory. ‘It is between the white lines of the pitch to show the people and, first, to show ourselves that we have to believe in our quality.

‘That was one of the messages we gave the boys. We played an impressive second half and that is how we like to play. If we play like that, I don’t think we will struggle. The way we played (against Liverpool) I think brings us a lot of confidence.’

So it should. If it took them a while to find their stride, Southampton regularly began causing Liverpool headaches. All over the pitch, figures in dark blue caught the eye, from Jose Fonte, the best central defender on the pitch, to the terrific Nathaniel Clyne.

In midfield James Ward-Prowse darted into dangerous areas and delivered a stream of impressive dead balls, Victor Wanyama was figure of muscular aggression, while Dusan Tadic showed enough flair to suggest that, at £10.9million, he could become a key figure.

Yet all those positives could not mask Koeman’s feelings. He had been at Anfield seven days earlier, along with his assistant Sammy Lee, to see Liverpool pummel Borussia Dortmund 4-0 but he had done his homework and it so nearly paid off.

‘We were unlucky but the final score makes the points,’ Koeman reflected. ‘At 1-1 one team on the pitch was playing and it was Southampton. We had a chance to score the second, two great opportunities, but the quality of Liverpool… that makes the difference.’

It was, ultimately, small details. If Simon Mignolet had not diverted Morgan Schneiderlin’s thumping 88th minute drive on the bar, Koeman’s belief would have been vindicated. As it is, he will have to wait for Saturday’s home date with West Brom to show why he has such faith.
