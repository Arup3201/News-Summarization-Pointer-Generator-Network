Petco said Monday it has removed all remaining Chinese-made dog and cat treats from its website and stores over fears they were linked to 1,000 dog deaths and made thousands more sick since 2007.

The San Diego-based company made the move  after the FDA revealed in May it had had more than 1,000 reports of pets dying, and more than 4,800 of illnesses, after dogs ate the treats in the US.

The illnesses and deaths were linked to a number of treats, including chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky.

At the time, the store vowed to pull the products from its shelves - a promise it has now made good on, despite the fact the FDA has yet to find a definite link between Chinese jerky and rawhide treats and the complaints.

The agency is still investigating. 

Rival chain PetSmart also vowed to ban the snacks, but it has yet to ban the treats from its stores.

However, the Phoenix-based company said it plans to have them out of its 1,300 stores by March. 

Petco made the decision after the FDA revealed it had received 4,800 reports of pets getting ill after eating Chinese-made treats - as well as 1,000 reports of deaths

Back in May, Petco CEO Jim Myers said his company's decision was made 'in the best interest of the pets'. 

'We know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in China, especially Chicken Jerky products, and we’ve heard their concern," he said in a statement.

'As a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents, we’re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats, the majority of which are made right here in the U.S. 

'Very simply, we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and, ultimately, for our business.' 

Petco Vice President John Sturm said all treats are now made in the U.S. or places such as the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and South America. 

The company risked tens of millions of dollars by changing treat vendors, he said.
