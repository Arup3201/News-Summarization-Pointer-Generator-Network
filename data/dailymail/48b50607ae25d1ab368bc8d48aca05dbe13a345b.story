It's a perfect reason to crack open the champagne – new research  suggests three glasses of bubbly a week can improve your memory.

Scientists are convinced a regular tipple of champagne can help  prevent brain disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Connoisseurs have long argued its benefits. Barrister and crime writer Sir John Mortimer drank a glass of champagne every morning and said it was the secret to a long life. He died aged 85.

But the study at Reading University is the first time scientists have identified health benefits in champagne. In Britain – where one in three over-65s develops dementia – it could be revolutionary.

The compound that helps stave off forgetfulness has been found in the black grapes, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, used for champagne.

Jeremy Spencer, a biochemistry professor who led the research, said: ‘These grapes are used in red wine and lots of research has been done on the health benefits of red wine, so I was curious to find out if there were any health attributes in champagne.’

Red wine, if consumed modestly, has been found to help lower blood pressure and protect the heart. This is due to the compound chemicals in vines known as flavonoids.

The memory aid found in champagne, however, is a different compound, phenolic acid.

Prof Spencer suggested anyone over 40 would be wise to drink two or three glasses of bubbly a week. He said: ‘Dementia probably starts in the 40s and goes on to the 80s. It is a gradual decline and so the earlier people take these beneficial compounds in champagne, the better.’

About 80 per cent of all champagne is made from the two black grape varieties blended with a white Chardonnay grape. Researchers found that after champagne was consumed there was a significant boost to  spatial memory – the ability to recognise surroundings that enables people to find their way home.

The experiments were conducted on rats but Prof Spencer is confident there would be a similar impact on the human brain.

The rats were given champagne daily with it mixed in their feed like a mash for six weeks. Each rat was allowed to run in a maze to find an edible treat. Five minutes later, the exercise was repeated to see if the rat had remembered where it had retrieved the original treat and where it could find another.

Without champagne, the rats had a 50 per cent success rate, but after a tipple their score shot up to an average 70 per cent. Biopsy tests measured proteins which are important for short-term memory.

Prof Spencer said: ‘The results were dramatic. After rats consumed champagne regularly, there was a 200 per cent increase of proteins important for determining effective memory. This occurred in rats after just six weeks. We think it would take about three years in humans.

‘This research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory.’

He is now hoping to conduct a trial on about 50 or 60 people aged over 65 who will be asked to drink champagne for three years.

A spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘This is an interesting study, especially for those who enjoy a glass of bubbly. However, people should not start celebrating just yet. This is the first time a link between champagne and dementia risk reduction has been found. A lot more research is needed.’
