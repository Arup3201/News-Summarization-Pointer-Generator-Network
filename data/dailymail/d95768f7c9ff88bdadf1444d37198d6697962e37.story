If the third World Cup final between Argentina and Germany resembles the first, we are in for an entertaining evening on Sunday.

If it is anything like the second final, four years later, we will be nodding off or turning over before the 9pm watershed.

A crowd of 114,600 filled the Aztec Stadium in Mexico City in 1986 to see Diego Maradona conclude the winning of his own World Cup.

Football’s devilish answer to Chucky had carried Argentina to the final with his Hand of God plus the Goal of the Century against England, in addition to his full repertoire of magic through the tournament.

West Germany, under the management of Franz Beckenbauer, strove to man-mark Maradona out of the game and came within minutes of succeeding, even though Jose Luis Brown and Jorge Valdano put Argentina two up inside an hour.

Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Rudi Voller seemed to have forced extra-time with late goals but Maradona was to have the last word. Finally, he wriggled free of his captors and plied Jorge Burruchaga with an exquisite pass for the 84th-minute winner. 

It hadn’t been pretty but the tension was gripping and Argentina were champions for the second time in three World Cups.

Maradona came back for more at Italia 90, only to become even more of a marked man.

He was kicked from first game to last, starting in Cameroon’s shock victory in the opening fixture of Argentina’s defence.

They battled angrily on to the final but at the expense of suspensions and injuries which decimated their team.

Maradona, both ankles as swollen as the ball and with those veins bulging blue and red, was warned he risked being crippled for life if he took part. He insisted on playing but not even he could save Argentina after they were reduced to nine men with the wounding dismissals of Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti.

Discipline: Maradona (third left) argues with the referee as Argentina have two players sent off in 1990 final

The Germans, who had scraped past Bobby Robson’s England in the semi, made painfully hard work of it. But the referee awarded a dubious 85th-minute penalty, converted by Andreas Brehme with familiar Teutonic precision.

Not pretty? It was downright ugly. But Beckenbauer, in the dugout for a second consecutive final, made his personally-deserved history by becoming the only World Cup winner as player, captain and manager.
