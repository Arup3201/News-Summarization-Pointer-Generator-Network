Anno Domini 2015 has dawned glittering with the prospect of more brilliant fights than for many a New Year.

A seismic shift in boxing politics, one stretching from this side of the Atlantic to the other, has raised real hope that Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao will be but one of several long-awaited fights which will make their way through the ropes in the coming 12 months.

Pressure from not only the public but some of the most respected figures in the game is compelling the rival tycoons of the ring to do business with each other for the benefit of the fans, the fighters and boxing itself.

Our own Lennox Lewis, still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, speaks for us all when he says: 'Let's stop all the nonsense and make this fight happen.'

He was referring to the Mayweather-Pacquiao saga in particular but that sentiment applies to any number of important bouts which have been blocked by the self-interest of rival promoters and television moguls often to the detriment of the game.

At last, the barriers are coming down.

The Golden Boy himself, Oscar De La Hoya, has led the way by reaching out to make the peace with his company's fiercest rival, Bob Arum.

Fights between members of these opposing stables began taking place before Christmas. For breaking down this barrier, as well as beating his addictions to drink and drugs, De La Hoya was named 'Promoter of 2014' by Sports Illustrated.

Now De La Hoya and Arum's Top Rank are deep in talks for Canelo Alvarez and Miguel Cotto to meet in a spring mega-fight.

More immediately, De La Hoya is co-promoting the first fight of major import in 2014 with old foe Don King.

Deontay Wilder, De La Hoya's great hope to end America's world heavyweight champion drought, challenges King's man Bermane Stiverne for the WBC title in Las Vegas in a fortnight. 

As the facilitating promoter for Mayweather's company in his recent fights, De La Hoya is also doing what he can to finally bring the Money Man and the PacMan together for the richest fight in ring history.

Although he would have a stronger financial stake in Amir Khan fighting Mayweather – which he proclaims as the best alternative, De La Hoya says: 'As a boxing fan first and foremost I understand completely that Floyd versus Manny is the fight all of us most want to see. It has to happen soon, for the good of boxing.'

The major obstacle, Mayweather's prevarications notwithstanding, is the stand-off between the two major US cable television networks. Mayweather Is contracted to Showtime; Pacquiao to HBO.

Lewis challenges them to collaborate: 'Both of them put my fight with Mike Tyson on pay-per-view and shared more than two million buys between them. I see no reason why they shouldn't do the same for a fight as huge as Mayweather v Pacquiao which would attract an even bigger audience.'

Nor does anyone else outside those board-rooms.

Meanwhile, a variation on the TV theme has exposed as a myth what appeared to be another of the monopolies which has handicapped British boxing down the decades.

Khan's scintillating performances in Las Vegas against Americans Luis Collazo and Devon Alexander were of importance beyond their impact on the Mayweather Sweepstakes.

The first was screened in this country on BoxNation by Frank Warren, who in the process of expanding his TV business is putting the quality of broadcast fights above the vested interest of his own promotions.

When Team Khan negotiated for the second to be on Sky, they excluded the promoter who was widely believed to hold the exclusive rights to put on all that station's boxing broadcasts.

By proceeding without Eddie Hearn, Sky opened the door to a world of alternative possibilities.

Although Hearn put on a magnificent production by filling Wembley Stadium with 80,000 fans for Carl Froch's rematch with George Groves and spreading the boxing gospel to a far wider cross-over audience which includes a younger generation, this has to be healthier.

Amir Khan (right) could potentially face the winner of the proposed Mayweather and Pacquiao bout 

For example, equal co-operation between Hearn's Matchroom company and Barry McGuigan's Cyclone operation in Belfast would increase the chances of Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton meeting in a much-wanted Battle of Britain for the unified world super-bantamweight championship. 

Perhaps it could happen after one of them has put down the threat from America's rival belt-holder Leo Santa Cruz.

Sky's willingness to work with Khan Promotions should simplify the making of a deal with Hearn for a fall-back fight with Kell Brook at Wembley Stadium, should Khan fail to pin down Mayweather and/or Pacquiao.

Open competition is the essence of sport and that needs to apply not only to boxers but to their paymasters.

As Lennox Lewis says: 'Boxing politricks must not prevent the fights the world wants to see.'
