Fox News host Bill O'Reilly tackled Barack Obama on his affordable healthcare act and the 2012 Benghazi attack in a tense Super Bowl Sunday interview today.

In the network's annual live pre-game show, President Obama was forced to defend himself against a barrage of Republican criticism.

During a tense 15-minute interview, Obama hit back at O'Reilly, saying the Fox News network was to blame for promoting scandals.

Hard ball: Obama was quizzed by O'Reilly over claims that the IRS targeted right-wing groups

As he was questioned about Obamacare, the Benghazi raid and accusations that the IRS targeted right-wing groups like the Tea Party, the President took a shot at Fox.

'These kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them,' he told O'Reilly.

The host seemed prepared for a tense interview, telling viewers beforehand: 'Although the President sometimes criticizes Fox News he knows the power of it.'

O'Reilly opened the interview by saying he wanted to get some things 'on the record' before asking Obama why Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, had not fired over the rocky roll out of the healthcare act.

The President didn't give a direct answer, telling O'Reilly only that people were being 'held accountable'.

He also declined to say that the biggest
 mistake of his presidency was telling Americans if they liked their 
healthcare they could keep it, and argued that the website was working the
 way it was supposed to.

'We've got 3 million people signed up so far. We're about a month behind where we anticipated we wanted to be,' he said.

The President also defended his administration as O'Reilly questioned him about why officials initially described the attack in Benghazi, Libya, as a spontaneous mob protest over an anti-Islamic, American-made video.

He rejected O'Reilly's 'notion that we would hide the ball for political purposes when a week later we all said in fact there was a terrorist attack taking place'.

'That wouldn't be a very good cover-up,' Obama said.

And, he added there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' contributing to the IRS targeting of Tea Party and other conservative groups when they applied for tax-exempt status.

The President also refused to be drawn on which team would win tonight's Super Bowl.

With the interview taking place just two hours before the Super Bowl got underway, Obama said the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks were too evenly matched to pick a winner.

He predicted a score of 24-21 but said he didn't know which side would come out on top.

Just as fans of the two Super Bowl teams will find no common grouns, reaction to the interview was massively divided.

Obama was accused on Twitter of dodging questions and being a liar, while O'Reilly was criticized for being disrespectful to a U.S. President.
