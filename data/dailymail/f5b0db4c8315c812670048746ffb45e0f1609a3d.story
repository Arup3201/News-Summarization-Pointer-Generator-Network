A pair of British students have developed a new technology capable of turning anything into an iPad-style tablet computer.

Dubbed the 'next big thing in home technology', the system lets people transform normal objects, such as an envelope or a fridge, into a tablet using a projector, depth camera and a PC.

The pair even showcased the PhD students' technology at a research conference hosted by Google at its Californian headquarters.

John Hardy and Carl Ellis from Lancaster University have created a system that lets you turn normal objects, such as an envelope or bed post, into a tablet computer. Mr Hardy, pictured, checks the temperature on his front door before leaving his house

The innovation was created by students John Hardy and Carl Ellis, both 25, from Lancaster University.

The software is called Ubi Displays and 
uses a projector, a depth camera and a PC to create interactive 
multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything.

Currently, the device, which is in a prototype phase includes all the technology in a rather bulky box that must sit opposite the object that the person wants to use as a tablet.

It does not rely on any other computers or devices.

The technology uses a high-tech projector to beam an image of an iPad, alarm clock, or any chosen device onto an object.

A webcam see pixels in red, 
green and blue along with depth and feeds details of what a person is doing and their movement back 
to the user’s computer.

The computer then uses their software to
work out where the user’s fingers are and what they are doing within 
the projected image to carry out a user's desired task.

The innovative software is called Ubi Displays and uses a projector, a depth camera and a PC to create interactive multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything, such as this fridge

This means a user could turn their bed into a high-tech interactive office and do a day’s work without getting up.

The pair said they are looking to develop their work commercially and are being supported by their university.

They hope that with development, the box of tricks will shrink to the size of a smartphone.

A promotional video the pair have filmed for YouTube shows an alarm clock being turned off simply by the touch of a bed post and BBC news headlines running across the headboard. 

The pair showcased their invention at a Google research conference in America. The technology is used on a fridge, pictured

The video also shows a plain envelope being used just like an iPad.

Hardy said the beauty of the software package is that it makes building interactive projected displays quick and easy.

He said: 'As our lives continue to 'go digital', we need interfaces that are able to integrate our digital world with our physical lives.

'Phones in pockets or screens on desks are not necessarily the best way forward because they are very restrictive in quite a number of ways.

'Playing, changing and experimenting with these designs can completely change how people use computers and how they behave as a result.

'Our technology is designed to be is quick and easy to set up and it does not require a hardcore programmer or team to develop interesting content.

'Indeed, in the physical world, being able to make a bedpost glow is in some ways a more compelling interface than a button on an iPhone app.'

He believes that the technology will one day be small enough to fit inside a light bulb.

The engineers said: 'What is unique about our offering is that it is not about screens any more. We can create interactive furniture, objects and pretty much anything you can dream up.' The technology is used here to show the user, through words projected onto the sideboard, that the kettle is ready

The pair of students, who have launched their own company, Hardy & Ellis Inventions, have made the beta release of their toolkit available online.

Mr Hardy said: 'We are very excited by the potential we feel the toolkit and software we have developed has commercially.

'It was fantastic to be asked to go over to California to show what we have to the people at Google.'

While the pair acknowledge that the combination of project and touch interaction is not a new idea, Hardy said that their offering moves the idea on 'dramatically'.

Creator Hardy is pictured using the device on his bed. The students' invention means you could turn your bed into a high-tech interactive office and do a day's work without getting up. The pair said they can create engaging displays almost anywhere

'What is unique about our offering is that it is not about screens any more.

'By leaving the world of glowing rectangles behind, we can create interactive furniture and objects; beds, sofas and pretty much anything you can dream up.'

'We can create engaging displays pretty much anywhere.'
