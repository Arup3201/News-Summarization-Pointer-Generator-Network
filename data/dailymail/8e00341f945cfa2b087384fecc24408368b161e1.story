It may look like a Photoshop effort, but Rami the dog really does have the head of a pit bull and the body of a dachshund.

And now photos of the rare combination dog, who's looking for a new home, have been shared widely by Internet users proclaiming his cuteness - though some say he looks more like an alien or a dinosaur.

The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society in Georgia is currently accepting applications for Rami, whose adoption post has gone viral.

Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society in Georgia is accepting applications for Rami, a pit bull-dachshund mix

The posts advertising Rami have received more than 40,000 shares on Facebook since his photos went viral on Tuesday

Rami's unique pit bull head has led him to be compared to a Tyrannosaurus Rex or bobblehead doll.

His body is long, but his legs are more muscular like those of a pit bull.

The dog breeding website Designer Mixes says that the combination of pit bulls and dachshunds is called a Doxbull or a Pitwee and can weigh about 25lbs when fully grown. 

The Humane Society says that Rami is 'full of energy' and doesn't 'listen very well, so you'll need to take some time to train me. Because I tend to be a bit hyper'.

Rami's ears have also been cut for an unknown reason. 

Potential owners will need to go through an interview process and pay for the canine's vaccinations before taking him home.

Internet users have left more than 9,000 comments on the photos and videos showing Rami, though they remain divided as to whether the dog is adorable or strange-looking

Photos and videos of the dog have been shared more than 40,000 times and generated more than 9,000 comments since Tuesday, most of which say that Rami is adorable.

Some commenters were unconvinced and thought that the pictures were doctored or that the animal was not a mix but actually has canine dwarfism, a condition that affects dogs' growth and spines.

Others were not impressed by the dog's unique appearance, saying Rami is 'freaky looking'.

Fears remain that the overwhelming interest in Rami will lead breeders to try and manufacture more unnatural designer mixes, which often have health problems.

For those that may be disappointed by missing out on adopting Rami, the Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society says there are many more unique animals at shelters across the country.
