A spring training baseball game between Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels was held up by a pitch invasion of honey bees.

The pesky visitors landed on the backstop netting and microphone during Sunday's game in Tempe, Arizona, causing quite a buzz.

The unusual visitors delayed the start as an exterminator was brought in to deal with the swarm.

Bee swarms are common in Arizona in March and it's not the first time the Angels have had to deal with the flying nuisances.

In 2013 they have two regular season games delayed and disrupted by a swarm in Anaheim.

Manager Mike Scioscia admitted he had never seen the honey makers create the kind of buzz they did on Sunday.

Sciosa said: 'We've never had them migrating, but like a tornado, they landed on the microphone. Fortunately, they stayed there until we could get rid of them.'

But Royals boss Ned Yost was left a little saddened by the whole thing. He said: 'I've never seen mass bee genocide like that.

'All you have to do is get some smoke. Trust me, I live in the country.

'You take some smoke out there because the queen is in there somewhere, you get a Shop-Vac and suck them all in and take them out to the parking lot and let them go.

'They're just honey bees, man. There's a decline in honey bees. We need them. It was sad to see, but they had to do what they had to do.'
