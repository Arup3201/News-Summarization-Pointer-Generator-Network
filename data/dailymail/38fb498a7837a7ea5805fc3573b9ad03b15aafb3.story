George Osborne will deliver a larger than expected boost to the NHS in this week’s Autumn Statement – injecting £2 billion to try to blunt Labour’s electoral advantage on the issue.

Government sources say that the Chancellor has found the money for the windfall from budget surpluses across Whitehall departments.

No 10 is acutely conscious that despite Ed Miliband’s rock-bottom personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour consistently polls ahead of the Conservatives.

The expected announcement in Wednesday’s speech comes after days of behind-the-scenes jostling between the Tories and Liberal Democrats to claim credit for the NHS funding boost, with Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb publicly calling for more resources to prevent a ‘crash’ in services over the winter.

It had previously been rumoured that the NHS boost would amount to only £1 billion.

The Autumn Statement is also expected to contain a number of big budget infrastructure announcements, with priority given to major new roads.

Ministers are under orders from No 10 to be photographed next to the projects for use in ‘puff’ pieces for local papers.

Mr Osborne will claim in the statement – his last major pre-Election Commons setpiece other than March’s Budget – that his handling of the economy has enabled him to free up extra resources for the health service.

No 10 is aware despite Ed Miliband’s (pictured) low personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour polls ahead of the Tories

‘You can’t have a strong NHS without a strong economy to pay for it. If you don’t have a long-term plan for the economy, you don’t have a plan for the future of the NHS,’ he is expected to say, adding: ‘We have both. It’s because our economy is growing, and we’ve kept a tight control on the finances, that we can do more for the NHS.’

The Chancellor is also planning to make the political point that extra NHS funding should be allied to the more efficient management which he claims would be ensured by a Conservative administration.

‘This will support the day- to-day work of our incredible nurses, doctors and other NHS staff; but it is also a down- payment on the future of our health service.

‘This new money will be used to buy the new facilities and services that will help transform the NHS so it becomes more efficient for taxpayers and effective for patients.’

Mr Osborne will also claim credit for the fact that ‘the British economy is growing faster than any other major economy in the world’ – but will also repeat David Cameron’s warning earlier this month about the risks of a new global downturn hitting the UK economy.

Labour fought back last night, with Chris Leslie, the party’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, saying: ‘This week George Osborne will have to admit that he has broken his promises.

‘He has failed to deliver rising living standards and that failure is why he’s also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year.

‘We need a plan to save and transform our health service too. Labour will raise an additional £2.5 billion a year, on top of Tory spending plans, for an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs.’
