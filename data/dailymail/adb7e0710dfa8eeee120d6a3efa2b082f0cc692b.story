Sandy Woodward, commander of the task force sent to reclaim the islands 30 years ago next month, said the Navy was in a 'dire' state

The Navy is as much use as 'a Swiss Navy' and would not be able to recapture the Falkland Islands if Argentina invaded, claims a veteran military chief.

The broadside came from Sandy Woodward, commander of the task force sent to reclaim the islands in the south Atlantic 30 years ago next month.

He said the Navy was in a 'dire' state following defence cuts which has left the service without an aircraft carrier before 2020.

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We could not retake the Falklands. If we had been in this state in 1982 the Falklands would be the Malvinas.'

Rear-Admiral Sir John Forster Woodward - who is known as Sandy - compared the British Navy to the Swiss Navy - the country does not have one - and said the role of a navy was to be able to go a long way from home.

He said: 'The best we can do for an expeditionary force is a day trip to France'.

It is not the first time a senior member of the military has attacked defence cuts and raised concerns about the Falklands.

Former First Sea Lord West has called for foreign aid cash to be diverted to defence after also warning Britain could not win a new Falklands War.

And, Major General Julian Thompson who commanded the brigade of Royal Marines during the conflict, said the
islands have been left vulnerable by the cuts, and it would be 'end
of story' if Argentine forces took the British base on East Falkland.

He told The Times earlier this month: 'The Argentines have a marine brigade. They've got a parachute brigade and some good special forces.'

'All they've got to do is get those guys
on to the islands for long enough to destroy the (RAF) Typhoon jets and
that's the end of it.'

Lord West says the Government was mad to cut the number of frigates and destroyers to 19, just one more than the 18 sunk or damaged in the 1982 conflict.

He believes small cuts in the aid, health or welfare budgets would make a disproportionate difference to defence and would enable Britain to restore its naval strength.

Lord West, then Commander Alan West, was skipper of HMS Ardent when she was sunk during the Falklands campaign.

The conflict claimed the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen.

The former Labour minister believes the lessons of that war are being forgotten in the current Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).

Diplomatic tension: Relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict

In an interview with the Plymouth-based Western Morning News he said : 'There are things which our nation thinks its forces can do, but they can no longer do them. Ever since 1945 we have been cutting and cutting.

'I am horrified our naval flotilla now comprises only 19 frigates and destroyers.

Major General Julian Thompson said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts

'In the Falklands, in the first month of fighting, we had four sunk and 14 damaged. That makes you think. We seem to have forgotten that when you fight you lose things.

'Here we are with 19 frigates and destroyers. Are they bonkers? Are they mad? How have they allowed this to happen?

'Today, because we don't have the carriers with fixed wing aircraft, we could not retake the Falklands, without our maritime we could not possibly have done it.

'I believe defence should get a better crack of the whip among Government departments. It seems to me a tiny fraction of the aid budget, the welfare budget and of the NHS, so tiny it would hardly affect them, would make an immense difference to defence.

'Yes there will be howls. We won't be able to give the Indians some aid so they won't be able to build their aircraft carriers.

'We won't be able to find something in health or in welfare. That always causes howls and squeals but the amounts we are talking about are tiny.'
