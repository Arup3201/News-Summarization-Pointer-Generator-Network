Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka will have to watch Saturday's Sky Bet Championship clash with Derby from the stands after he was handed a one-game touchline ban by the Football Association.

The Spaniard was charged with improper conduct for his behaviour in the closing moments of Boro's 1-1 draw with Blackburn on November 29.

Karanka allegedly pushed fourth official David Coote when tempers flared following a controversial late equaliser from Rovers.

He requested a personal hearing and the FA have now issued a ban.

An FA statement read: 'Following an independent regulatory commission hearing today (Wednesday), Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka will serve a one-match touchline suspension with immediate effect.

'Karanka, who was also fined £2,000, admitted an FA charge of improper conduct in relation to his behaviour during stoppage time at the end of the game against Blackburn Rovers on 29 November 2014.'
