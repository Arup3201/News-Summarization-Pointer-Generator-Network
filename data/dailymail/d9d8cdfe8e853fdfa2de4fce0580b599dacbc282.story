California is the nation’s snobbiest state, according to a ranking of the snootiest mid-sized cities in the country.

Six of the top ten snobby cities in a list compiled by Movoto are in the Golden State. The rest are scattered around the country, and some are quite surprising.

The nationwide online real estate database compiled the list from a variety of factors including median home price, per cent of population with a college degree and country clubs per capita.

The most stuck-up: California claims six of the country's snobbiest cities

Pasadena – home to the Rose Bowl, art galleries, many private schools and its own symphony orchestra – took first place.

The Los Angeles suburb has the fifth-highest median home price, many performing arts venues and several nearby country clubs, according to Movoto.

Thousand Oaks, California came in at second. 

It has the lowest number of fast food restaurants per capita of any cities in the top 10, but also boasts the third-highest median home prices and household incomes of any municipality on the list.

Other factors used to measure how the towns favored by America’s upper crust stack against each other included private school per capita, performing arts per capita, art galleries per capita and county clubs per capita – the more the better.

The less fast food restaurants a town has, the better.

Alexandria, Virginia came in at third because the Washington, D.C. suburb boasts the third-highest number of college grads and the second-most art galleries per capita.

City residents also bring home the bacon, Alexandrians earn the seventh-highest household incomes.

Chicago suburb Naperville, Illinois, found itself in the four slot. Residents earn the second-highest incomes, and over 66 per cent hold college degrees.

Eugene: This Oregon city boasts high home values and incomes, in addition to spectacular mountain views and nature trails

The wise 
and wealthy get work on their handicaps in the seventh-most country 
clubs and are often quick to remind visitors Naperville has been named 
to several best places to live lists over the past few years.

Napa
 Valley outpost Santa Rosa rounds out the top five. Wine country’s 
biggest city has sky-high median home prices and incomes, as well 
several fine restaurants to serve the local product.

It also has the seventh-best number of performing arts centers and a plethora of art galleries, making it the region’s cultural mecca.

Fort Lauderdale, Florida comes in at six. Its high number of country clubs, art galleries, and performing arts venues – plus proximity to Miami – have Florida’s elite making it one of their many homes.

A trio of California cities – Glendale, Sunnyvale, and Fullerton – come in at places seven, eight and nine for a variety of reasons including high incomes and skyrocketing home prices.

Eugene, Oregon surprisingly comes in at number 10. Located about 120 miles south of Portland, it has a significant number of performing arts centers, art galleries and upscale eateries. A beer brewery is also within the city limits.
