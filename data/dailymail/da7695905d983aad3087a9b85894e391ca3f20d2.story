Migrants with HIV should not be allowed to enter Britain, Nigel Farage has said.

In remarks that will prompt a storm of controversy, the Ukip leader explained that he wanted to control the ‘quality’ of immigration into Britain and suggested this should include the medical condition of incomers.

In an interview with Newsweek Europe, published today, Mr Farage said it was wrong that the ‘chances of admission’ of highly qualified engineers from India were limited.

‘Ukip want to control the quantity and quality of people who come,’ he said.

Nigel Farage said the UK should continue to accept refugees, but said that Ukip would control the 'quality and quantity' of other immigrants, including those with HIV

Referring to convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who is suspected of murdering London schoolgirl Alice Gross, he added: ‘It’s simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn’t have been allowed here.’

Asked whether ‘quality’ meant people without a homicide conviction, he answered: ‘Yes. And people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That’s a good start. And people with a skill. That is what Britain should do.’ 

A patient from overseas suffering from HIV is entitled to lifelong treatment on the NHS.

Thanks to a change in policy, an HIV-positive migrant could go and see their GP complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds.

This is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, the Coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with HIV, even if their cases were not emergencies.

The NHS now offers expensive £20,000-a-year antiretroviral drugs to all non-British residents in England with the disease, including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas. 

The average lifetime treatment cost for an HIV-positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds.

And once here, if a migrant or asylum seeker has HIV or Aids, it is hard to remove them. 

This is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights. 

It is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the Health Service in total. 

But doctors have warned that the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’ could be billions of pounds.

He went on to say: ‘I have never said that we should not take refugees. We have a proud record of accepting refugees, and that must be continued.’

Nearly 20 Tories backed an unsuccessful amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in Britain to prove that they were not HIV positive or carrying Hepatitis B.

In 2010, Barack Obama overturned a 20-year-old US travel and immigration ban against people with HIV.

Currently around 60 countries bar the entry of HIV-positive people, according to the United Nations.

The list includes the Bahamas, the Kingdom of Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.

Conservative MP Henry Smith said the Ukip leader’s remarks had been designed to generate the maximum amount of publicity.

He added: ‘It’s official – Nigel Farage doesn’t care about the long-term future of our country, all he’s interested in is the next publicity stunt. 

'With offensive gimmicks like this he’s shown he has no credible plan to tackle the uncontrolled mess that Labour left our immigration system in.’

And Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV charity, said: ‘The idea that having HIV should be used as a black mark against someone’s name is ridiculous, and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue.’ 

She added: ‘It is to the UK’s credit that for more than three decades successive governments, no matter their political stamp, have refused to put in place border controls against people living with HIV.

‘Major international organisations – including the United Nations – agree that such draconian measures would have no impact on the epidemic. 

'In bracketing those living with the condition with murderers, and suggesting that there is no place for them in his vision of Britain, Mr Farage has stooped to a new level of ignorance. He should be truly ashamed.’

During the interview, Mr Farage also spoke about Arnis Zalkalns, the Latvian immigrant suspected of killing London schoolgirl Alice Gross, saying 'he shouldn’t have been allowed here'

Last year cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned that the problem of foreigners travelling to Britain for treatment, then leaving without paying was ‘massive and escalating’.

But last night Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the health select committee, said: ‘This is a despicable thing to say, given that we’ve spent decades trying to remove the stigma from this disease. 

'To pull out one disease over another is pretty disgusting, and shows how regressive some of UKIP’s concerns can be.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage will declare today that he wants to be Minister for Europe in a coalition government.

His party was confident last night of returning its first MP in a by-election in Clacton, Essex, triggered by the defection of Tory MP Douglas Carswell.

Ukip was also on course to take a huge chunk of the Labour vote in another by-election in the northern seat of Heywood and Middleton, following the death of MP Jim Dobbin.

Though Labour was expected to hold the seat, party sources conceded that Ukip was likely to end up winning more than 30 per cent of the vote, more than in any previous by-election.

In an interview with Newsweek Europe, Mr Farage suggested Ukip could win enough votes in the general election to be invited to form a coalition. He said: ‘If things go well next spring, I would like to be Minister for Europe.

‘I mean that quite seriously. I would like to be the person who goes to Brussels and says, we want to trade with you.

‘We want reciprocal relationships. But this European Treaty doesn’t work for us, and so we are breaking it.’
