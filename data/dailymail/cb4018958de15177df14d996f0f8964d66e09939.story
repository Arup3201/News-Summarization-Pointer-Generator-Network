As a doctor – and also a parent – I was deeply concerned by the controversial case of Neon Roberts, the seven-year-old whose mother Sally refused to allow him to have radiotherapy for his brain tumour.

The hospital caring for Neon sought legal backing to give him the treatment against her wishes, and last month the High Court ruled that six weeks of radiotherapy should start early this month, followed by 18 months of chemotherapy.

Despite compelling evidence that the alternative approaches she found via the internet were unlikely to work, Ms Roberts remains defiant. Yet I strongly believe the correct decision was made. Neon is now more  likely to survive the cancer.

Dilemma: Sally Roberts with her cancer-stricken son Neon

The case has highlighted many misconceptions about parental rights, along with the risks and benefits of cancer treatment. Here, I answer the questions I have been asked most . . .

Surely the parent’s wishes ought to be paramount?Actually, no. The patient’s rights are paramount. When there is danger to a child, doctors have to act in their best interests.

Some argue that doctors ought to have more power in the treatment of conditions such as measles, but unless there is a life-or-death situation you can’t impose health diktats. Ms Roberts was choosing a route that meant her son was more likely to die.

Case lost: After an appeal in London's High Court a judge ruled that Sally Roberts is no longer allowed to refuse treatment for Neon

At what point are doctors acting in more than an advisory capacity?Where doctors believe that parental decisions may be not in a child’s best interests, it can be necessary to seek a view from the courts.

Doctors believed Neon would die within months without radiotherapy. I see that Ms Roberts was in a desperate position, but she doesn’t seem able to make a rational decision.

There is a five-year survival rate of 86 per cent for patients with medulloblastoma – the type of cancer suffered by Neon – who have radiotherapy.

Due to the delays in his treatment, Neon now has an estimated 67 per cent chance of survival.

Sally Roberts argued that radiotherapy could do more harm than good. Could she be right?All cancer treatment  is backed up by data based on millions of patients. However, there are no absolutes. It’s all about odds. We know the treatment most likely to work, but not whether it will be successful.

Actress Hayley Mills recently spoke about her decision to stop chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer. Should her cancer return, it is more likely to be terminal because chemotherapy helps to prevent the spread of tumours.

A recent Oxford University study involving about 100,000 women concluded that having chemotherapy reduces breast cancer mortality by about a third.

Doctor's advice: Such as in the case of Neon, it is what is best for the patient which is paramount, not the parent's wish

But what about the damage radiotherapy could cause?There are undoubtedly risks with radiation, including growth problems and infertility. However, given that medics concluded Neon would die without this treatment, the benefits outweigh the risks.

Sally Roberts argued that the only evidence she was offered for the efficacy of radiation was a paper from the Forties. Is this true?There is plenty of research backing up use of radiotherapy in this cancer. It is possible Ms Roberts hasn’t seen this. Children in developed countries have been given radiotherapy for more than half a century. If you compare the cancer survival rates of rich and poor countries, our treatments make a clear difference.

What about the other medics advising her? Their opinions have been totally dismissed.None was on the specialist register. One spelt medulloblastoma incorrectly. It makes me so angry that these quacks prey on the vulnerable. None of the alternatives is clinically proven in the treatment of this cancer.

If Sally Roberts is considered irresponsible, should Neon be taken away from her?No. She is in an appalling position. My heart goes out to her. She is trying to do the best thing. This doesn’t reflect on her everyday parenting.
