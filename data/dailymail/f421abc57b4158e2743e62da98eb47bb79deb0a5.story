Dozens of drug-crazed vandals trashed a house when they gatecrashed a teenage girl's sleepover - intended for just two close friends.

Sixteen-year-old Amey Holmes-Evans, had invited friends over for a 'girls' night in' complete with pizza and a film to celebrate one of them turning 17.

But the movie night descended into chaos when word of the quiet get-together spread around their college and around 60 yobs crammed into the three-bed rented home in Hook, Hampshire.

Student Amey Holmes-Evans, 16, invited her friends over to watch a film and eat a pizza to celebrate one of them turning 17, but word of the quiet get-together spread around their college, in Hook, Hampshire

Food from the kitchen was smeared over the carpets and walls, a drum kit destroyed, and pictures ripped down and smashed by more than 60 uninvited guests

Officers arrived to find cigarettes, alcohol cans, and bottles strewn across the floor - along with evidence of drug taking

The 16- to 18-year-olds urinated on bedding, smashed holes in the ceilings and ripped doors off their hinges - causing £20,000 of damage.

They tore up a Christmas tree in the sitting room, ripped up cards and smashed baubles.

Shocked neighbours in the quiet cul-de-sac finally called police when they saw revellers throwing furniture and toilet rolls into the road.

Dozens of drug-crazed yobs trashed Sam Mabbott's home at her teenaged daughter's sleepover, originally intended for just two close friends

Officers arrived to find cigarettes, alcohol cans, and bottles strewn across the floor - along with evidence of drug taking.

The family cat is currently in a cattery, where it is showing signs of being traumatised.

Food from the kitchen had been smeared over the carpets and walls, a drum kit destroyed, and pictures ripped down and smashed.

The gatecrashers went room to room, pulling personal belongings from drawers and wardrobes and bizarrely taping cutlery to the ceiling.

The gang of vandals even went through the family's entire CD collection, snapping each one in half.

Devastated
mother Sam Mabbott, 39, was out for the evening when Amey, who has 
Asperger's syndrome, phoned shortly before midnight to say things had 
spiralled out of control.

She collected her from the the police station, where she had been taken for her own protection, before returning home.

The damage caused was so bad the family have been forced to move out and are unlikely to return for two months, while contractors make repairs.

Single mother Sam, a counselling service administrator, has been 'traumatised' by the sight that greeted her on her arrival back home.

She said: 'I left home at around 4.30pm to catch the train to London, where I was having a night out.

'Amey had asked me if she could host a party for her friend's birthday and I said "Absolutely no way - never in a million years."

'I told her she could have two female friends visit for a sleepover and to watch a film.

'I bought her some pizzas and chips and gave her some extra bedding for them to sleep in. I thought at 16 she could be trusted.

'In the end around 60 people turned up. It got wildly out of control and descended into chaos.'

She added: 'When I collected Amey from the police station, officers told me the place had been trashed.

'However, nothing could prepare me for the horrific scene I saw when I returned home. I was shaking and left feeling sick and panicky.

'The yobs had gone from room to room destroying everything along the way.

The vandals made their way through Ms Mabbott's wardrobe, pulling out clothes and covering them in beauty products

'They showed no respect as they carried out their deliberate acts of vandalism - even going through my wardrobe, pulling out clothes and covering them in beauty products.

'I hold every single one of them responsible because nobody phoned the police or tried to stop them.'

Ms Mabbott said things are now strained between her and her daughter and while she is living with her parents, Amey is staying with friends.

She said: 'It's fair to say things between me and Amey are strained at the moment and we are living apart.

'Everything is still extremely raw and I don't know if I will ever be able to trust her again. Police said the place stank of cannabis when they arrived.

'They found a bong and evidence of the drug ketamine, which people had been snorting off surfaces.'

Vicky O'Hare, from Hampshire Constabulary, said police are treating the incident as criminal damage.She added: 'The investigation is ongoing.'
