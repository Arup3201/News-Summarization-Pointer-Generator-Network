Executives at the watchdog set up to monitor MPs’ pay and expenses are claiming £400 a day for meetings they hold over the phone, it has been claimed.

Minutes of two board meetings at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority show only its chairman, Sir Ian Kennedy, attended, while the remaining executives took part over the phone.

The revelation was made by veteran  Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell in a  parliamentary question to Commons Leader, Sir George Young.

Sir Bob told the Commons: ‘Good  news, since my question last week Ipsa has put the minutes of many of its board meetings on its website.

‘It reveals a lack of attendance by most of the members.

‘Indeed, at the meetings on January 30 and March 8, no board members attended other than the chairman. They participated by telephone, for which one assumes they qualified for £400 per day.

‘Bearing in mind that the meeting on March 8, and I quote, “had been convened in order to consider the outcome of  the consultation on MPs” pension contributions and to approve Ipsa’s corporate plan for 2012/13, do you agree  with me that at the very least we, as  members, should debate what the Ipsa board is up to?’

Sir George Young, Conservative MP for North West Hampshire

Sir George replied: ‘Ipsa is an  independent body set up by the House  to adjudicate on our pay and pensions. There may be an opportunity to  address the issue of membership when the term of office for some of the existing members runs out and the question  of appointment or reappointment of members arises.

‘I would say to you that your intervention shows the effectiveness of backbench members of this House in business questions of getting results.’

Ipsa was created by the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 in the wake of  the expenses scandal, in which it was revealed MPs had claimed for items including a duck house and moat-cleaning.

Until the scandal was uncovered, MPs were paid more than £60,000 a year and under a self-regulated system were allowed to claim tens of thousands pounds more for the upkeep of their second homes and offices, often without submitting receipts.

IPSA is tasked with bringing independent control over MPs’ expenses and operates by regularly publishing details of claims and business costs.

The watchdog is also responsible for  setting the level of and paying MPs’ annual salaries; paying the salaries of MPs’ staff, drawing up, reviewing, and administering allowances schemes;  and determining the procedures for investigations and complaints made against politicians.
