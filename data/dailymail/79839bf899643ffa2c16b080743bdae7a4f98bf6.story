It was the first baby for its mother 12-year old Keo who was in labour for an hour.

She was carefully monitored by trainers in the lagoon at the Hilton Waikoloa Village.

It was a family affair with grandmother Pele and aunt Noelani who were also in the Dolphin Quest lagoon to 
keeping her company.

It also proved to be a draw for spectators as dozens of people gathered around the pool to witness the birth at 5:10pm on Monday.

Within four hours Keo was contently nursing her new daughter.

The newborn's name has not yet been decided - the first month is critical for the survival of young dolphins.

Once she has made it pass the 30 day period, during which she will be watched around-the-clock,  she will be named after a contest.

Michelle Campbell, Dolphin Quest Hawaii's director of Marine Animals told kitv.com:

'We
were crossing our fingers and our flukes, wishing for the best, not 
knowing how she’s going to fare with what’s happening to her.

'We let her approach us. We would gently reach out with a hand on the back to make sure they're OK, you know, a mom in labor and the myriad of emotions she must be feeling', said Ms Campbell.

The newborn is the first second-generation baby at the the aquarium after Keo was born there in 2000.

The birth of a dolphin in captivity is very rare and this footage is thought to be one of few caught on camera.
