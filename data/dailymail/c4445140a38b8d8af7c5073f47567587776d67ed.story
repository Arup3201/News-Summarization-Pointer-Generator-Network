A jeweller has been left empty-handed after he unknowingly accepted £4.7million in Monopoly money from two conmen in a sale of four 'rare' rings and a necklace.

The Greek man is said to have been conned by the men, who claimed to be French, after they contacted him to buy the antique pieces of jewellery.

In a bid to avoid paying tax on the sale of the jewellery, it is alleged the seller planned to meet the pair in Paris, France, to carry out the exchange. 

The Greek seller is said to have been conned by the buyers, who claimed to be French, after they handed him a suitcase containing £4.7million in Monopoly money in exchange for four 'rare' rings and a necklace in Paris

The 'French' buyers arrived at the meet point on Rue des Mathurins with a suitcase filled with £4.7million in fake cash, Le Parisien reported.

The Greek seller is then reported to have taken one of the wads of cash – totalling nearly £400 – to a currency exchange store to confirm its authenticity.

After supposedly being happy the money was legitimate, he then returned to the two buyers and concluded the sale.

However, after they had fled the scene, he apparently realised the remaining money in the briefcase was fake money from the board game Monopoly.

'After his clients left, the jeweller checked the rest of the bills. That's when he realised there was a problem,' an unnamed source told Le Parisien.

'The majority of the bills bore the name of the famous game Monopoly.'

The man reportedly tried to contact the buyers but was forced to report the incident to police after they failed to return his calls.
