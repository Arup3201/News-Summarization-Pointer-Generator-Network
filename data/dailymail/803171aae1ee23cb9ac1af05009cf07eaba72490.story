A Russian heavyweight boxer is in a medically-induced coma in critical condition after losing a brutal fight at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.

Magomed Abdusalamov was taken to Roosevelt Hospital in New York City following his 10-round brawl with Mike Perez Saturday night. He sought treatment because he believed he had a broken nose and hand.

However, at the hospital, he complained of a headache. A scan revealed a blood clot in his brain.Â

Brutal: Magomed Abdusalamov (right) lost a bloody bout with Mike Perez Saturday night in which he broke both his hand and his nose

After the fight, Abdusalamov complained of a headache. A scan revealed he was suffering from a blood clot in his brain

He was rushed to surgery to remove the clot and stem the bleeding. Doctors put him in a medically-induced coma.

He is currently unconscious in critical condition, according to doctors at Roosevelt Hospital.

The New York Daily News reports that Abdusalamov, 32, walked out of the ring Saturday night after losing to Cuban-born Perez by a unanimous decision of the judges. He could be seen shaking his head in disappointment.

Abdusalamov was 18-0 with 18 knockouts before Saturday night's fight, which was broadcast on HBO Sports.

The match was the talk of Twitter for its brutality and Abdusalamov's reputation as the 'Russian Tyson.'

Perez beat the 'Russian Tyson' after 10 rounds in the ring on Saturday night. It was his first loss. Previously he had scored 18 knockouts in 18 bouts

Both men took a beating during the brawl, though it appears Abdusalamov took the brunt of the damage, as evidenced by his swollen face

Abdusalamov is married with two young daughters. His promoter says he's in the process of becoming an American citizen

His promoter Nathan Lewkowicz, says despite the doctors' assessments, the boxer is actually in 'stable' condition and his reflexes appear to be returning.

Lewkowicz said the Abdusalamov's doctors hope he will be able to make a full recovery because of his age and his conditioning.

Perez, who is now 20-0 with 12 knockouts, issued a statement Monday expressing concern for his opponent.

'Mago is in my thoughts and prayers and I hope he recovers quickly,' he said.

'He fought like a true warrior. I'm happy to be victorious but my main concern is for his health.'

Abdusalamov has a wife and two daughters and is in the process of becoming an American citizen, Lewkowicz told the Daily News.
