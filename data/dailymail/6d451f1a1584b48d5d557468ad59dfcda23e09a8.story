The Ryder Cup gets underway on Friday as Europe look to retain the trophy after their sensational comeback in 2012 in the so called 'Miracle of Medinah' on US soil.

Englishman Ian Poulter tells Sportsmail all you need to know about his European team-mates who will be in action at Gleneagles.

(Top row L-R) Lee Westwood, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, (middle row L-R) Ian Poulter, Thomas Bjorn, Stephen Gallacher, Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, (front row L-R) Henrik Stenson, Rory McIlroy, Europe team captain Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Sergio Garcia of the 2014 European team pose

Rory McIlroy

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 4-3-2

Honestly, is there anything more to say? Who wouldn’t want to partner Rory? I never thought I’d see the equal of the golf Tiger played in the summer of 2000 but Rory’s 12 rounds in July and August (at The Open, USPGA and Bridgestone) were every bit as good.

Martin Kaymer

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 3-2-1

He’s very German, isn’t he? Very efficient and like a machine when he’s on a roll. If he gets close to how he played in winning the US Open it’s bad news for the Americans. He blew everyone’s mind that week.

Thomas Bjorn

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 3-2-1

I guess it’s because he’s chairman of our Tournament Players Committee, but I always think of him as the headmaster. Is it okay if I call him the old warrior? Big Liverpool fan but we won’t hold that against him.

Denmark's Thomas Bjorn will act as Europe's 'headmaster'

Victor Dubuisson

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

Here’s something you didn’t know about our mystery Frenchman. He’s a huge petrolhead like myself. I like him a lot and I’ve got high hopes for him this week. He’s fearless, just like all the best Ryder Cuppers.

Sergio Garcia

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 16-8-4

Isn’t it fabulous to see the old Sergio back among us this year? Finally settled off the course, and I’ve a feeling he’s going to deliver big time this week. Loves the Ryder Cup with a Poulter-like passion.

Sergio Garcia is back to his best in time for the Ryder Cup

Justin Rose

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 6-3-0

My oldest mate on tour. Vulnerable in the past but fulfilled all his potential now and I can’t see it ever going away like it did once. I don’t think it’s giving away any secrets to say I expect to partner him at some stage.

Jamie Donaldson

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

Looks to me like his game changed completely after winning against a high-class field in Abu Dhabi in January last year. From that point he became so strong and consistent. Welcome to the club, Jamie.

Henrik Stenson

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 2-3-2

It’s a good job it’s not an arm-wrestling contest because the Americans would have no chance against this man: 6ft 4in, 220lb of pure muscle — man, he is seriously strong. A funny guy, too.

Graeme McDowell

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 5-5-2

We’ve seen it in majors and in Ryder Cups — G-Mac personifies guts. And, boy, can he putt. You could pile 11 men on his back and he would warrior through it, he’s that type of guy.

Graeme McDowell personifies guts, according to Ian Poulter

Lee Westwood

Ryder Cup record: (W-L-H): 18-13-6

Nine Ryder Cups and 40-odd wins around the world? Are you serious? I tell you, all those people who throw the major thing at him because he hasn’t won one haven’t a clue what they are talking about.

Stephen Gallacher

Ryder Cup record: Debut.

What a special week for him. His play in the qualifying process was so impressive he fully deserved his wildcard. He’s got a great record around Gleneagles as well. Do you think the home support for him might be quite impressive?

Ian Poulter

Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 12-3-0

He’s been beyond useless all season but look at that Ryder Cup record. I can promise you this: he’s pumped, he’s ready and the postman is keen and eager to make another delivery.
