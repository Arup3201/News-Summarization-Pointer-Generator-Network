Six relatives including two pregnant women were rushed to hospital after a family of 20 piled onto a wooden staircase to take their annual Christmas photo - only for it to collapse.

Marcella and Kenny Gillenwater were delighted when their children, grandchildren, siblings and other family members arrived at their house in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, on Christmas Day. 

In keeping with their family's tradition, they all gathered on the steps of their 20ft outdoor staircase after lunch to pose for a picture. But before the snap was taken, the staircase collapsed.

Following the disaster, believed to be weight-induced, six family members, including the Gillenwaters' heavily pregnant niece, Tara Baker Calhoun, and another expectant mother, were taken to hospital.

Tradition: Twenty members of the Gillenwater family piled onto a staircase to take their annual Christmas photo last Thursday- only for it to collapse. Above, 21 members of the Gillenwater family in their 2011 photo

Mr Gillenwater's brother - who was standing near the top of the staircase and plunged almost 20 feet - broke his femur and heel, while one of his nephews suffered a broken ankle, according to WLKY. 

They are both currently awaiting further surgery at UofL Hospital. Meanwhile, the two pregnant women - who were positioned near the bottom of the staircase - were released after being checked over.

Remarkably, Ms Baker Calhoun has since given birth to a healthy son at Baptist Hospital East. Her relatives do not believe the collapse caused her labor since her due date was in early January.

Two other relatives were injured in the incident at the Four Seasons subdivision, but not hospitalized.

On Tuesday, Mr Gillenwater's elderly mother - also on the staircase at the time - said the incident seemed to happen in 'slow motion'. She said they all heard a 'pop' and then the wood gave way.

Following the collapse, a relative called 911 and Hardin County EMS rushed to the scene 

'When our crews got there we saw eight patients, but we only took six of those to the hospital,' said John Malconson, of HC EMS. 'They were taking a family photo and the stairs collapsed.'

Speaking to Yahoo News, he added: 'The person at the top probably fell about 20 feet. All of our ambulances that were on duty that day responded.' 

Mr Gillenwater's mother said the family is now focused on recovery - and that although the ordeal was frightening for all involved, they will continue to take their traditional Christmas photo in future years.

It is not the first time a family's Christmas photo has ended in disaster. 

Last December, 25 members of the Wilt family, including a five-month-old baby, crowded onto the deck of their clubhouse in Indiana and posed for a group photo, Wave3.com reported.

However, seconds later, the deck collapsed, hurling everyone including the photographer to the ground. Seven people were injured, with some suffering broken bones and neck fractures.

The family later filed a lawsuit against the firm which constructed and maintained the deck.
