Kolo Toure left Anfield the happier sibling as Liverpool defeated younger brother Yaya’s Manchester City on Sunday.

Kolo’s late appearance in the game was a special one as it was the first time the Ivory Coast duo had gone head-to-head in a competitive game.

Before the lunchtime kick off Yaya tweeted: Love my big bro. He has taught me so much. But today… May the best Toure... sorry team win.’

However, a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool probably wasn’t what Yaya had in mind as Manchester City slipped up yet again in their pursuit of the title.

A wonder goal in each half, either side of an Edin Dzeko strike, handed Liverpool all three points as Brendan Rodgers’ side continue to stake their claim for Champions League qualification.

Despite the defeat Yaya and Kolo showed their brotherly love at the full time whistle as they walked off the pitch together.
