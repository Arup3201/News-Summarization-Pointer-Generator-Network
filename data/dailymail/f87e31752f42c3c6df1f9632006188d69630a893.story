Natalie Russo, from Seattle, designs lashes with peacock feathers, fruit, pastries, salad and baby animals

When mascara is just not enough, it's now commonplace to reach for a set of false eyelashes.

But a designer has now invented strips covered in foam fruit, baby farm animals, and even metallic unicorns.

The daring designs are made by Natalie Russo who handweaves tiny glass beads onto ultra thin wire creating a lightweight, flexible band that can be formed to the shape of any eye.

Natalie Russo's Unicorn Eyelash Jewelry is made with unicorn shapes attached to glass beads and beading wire

Natalie used blingy metallic unicorns and tiny ice cream cones to complete the whimsical eyelashes

Natalie recently made an ambitious 
yet whimsical set of lashes with blingy metallic unicorns, tiny ice 
cream cones and beaded bands in pastel pink and blue. They sold out 
almost immediately.

But her online shop on Etsy - the massive online marketplace that hosts creative businesses - is still 
full of fun and wacky eyelash attachments including Vegas themed ones, sets featuring fruit, pastries, salad and even baby animals.

She also 
offers custom made designs and ships worldwide.

While they look potentially heavy and
 awkward, Natalie assures you only need to bend the 'eyelash jewellery' 
into the proper shape of the eye, apply a thin layer of adhesive glue 
and press directly above your eyelashes.

She uses mainly Japanese Toho brand 
seed beads, which have are smaller than usual ones, super shiny and have
 a smooth shape for maximum flexibility and comfort.

Her Summer Picnic eyelashes include cherries, apples, grapes, pastries, and eggs - good enough to eat

Her Wispy Snowflake lashes are made of thin albino peacock feathers and 24k gold plated Delica beads

Some of her designs also include 2mm Swarovski crystals and genuine gem stone beads

Natalie created this product in 2010 after searching for a sturdier alternative to the mass-produced false eyelashes on the market.

She states that her eyelash jewellery is lightweight, waterproof, and flexible.

Some of her designs also include 2mm Swarovski crystals and genuine gem stone beads.

She recommends applying them with Duo eyelash glue, sold in most [pharmacies, allowing it to 'set' or become tacky, and then pressing the lashes onto your eyelid directly above your own eyelashes.

Salad themed lashes feature mushrooms, eggs, tomatoes and onion (left) while the baby animal farm set features miniature chicks, frogs, lambs and piglets, accented by an iridescent heart or flower (right)
