Liverpool's loan striker Divock Origi scored his third goal in six Ligue 1 games for Lille to guide them to a 1-0 win over Bastia.

The 19-year-old Belgian scored the only goal six minutes before half-time to move his side into third place in the French top-flight, four points behind leaders Marseille.

Origi joined Liverpool from Lille in a £10m deal this summer before being loaned back to the French club.

While Brendan Rodgers will be pleased with the progress of his loan star, he will hope the rest of his Liverpool strikeforce start to fire.

Daniel Sturridge is currently on the sidelines after picking up an injury while on England duty while Mario Balotelli has struggled to hit the back of the net.

The Italian £16m signing has scored just one goal in his first six games for Liverpool - against Ludogorets in the Champions League.
