An Arizonan mother awaiting retrial after 23 years on death row has made a desperate plea for bail after learning that her own mother is dying of cancer, MailOnline can reveal.

Debra Milke was found guilty of playing a part in the murder of her 4-year-old son Chrisopher in 1989. 

Her conviction was dramatically overturned in March when it emerged that the State had knowingly withheld evidence that lead detective, Armando Saldate, Jr, ‘lied under oath and trampled the constitutional rights of suspects.’

Life Sentence: Debra Milke, now 49, has spent 23 years of her life on Death Row for the murder she maintains she did not commit

Speaking to MailOnline her attorney Michael Kimerer said: ‘It’s unbelievable that this is going to a retrial. I think for political reasons it’s one the prosecutor can’t let go. He can’t accept her innocence.’

Milke’s bail plea will be heard on August 1st and a date for her retrial has been set for 30 September.

In a damning conclusion to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals’s findings four months ago, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote: ‘The Phoenix Police Department and Saldate’s supervisors there should be ashamed of having given free rein to a lawless cop to misbehave again and again, undermining the integrity of the sytem they were sworn to uphold.’

The original trial which was Milke convicted and sentence to death was, according to Judge Kozinski, ‘essentially a swearing context between Milke and Phoenix Police Detective Armando Saldate, Jr.’

There was no physical evidence connecting Milke to the crime and no corroborating testimony. The State’s case depended entirely on a confession extracted by Detective Armando Saldate, Jr

Milke has consistently denied the confession which was neither witnessed nor recorded. Saldate’s notes were not submitted at trial.

Yet, Judge Kozinski observed: ‘The judge and jury believed Saldate…they didn’t know about Saldate’s long history of lying under oath and other misconduct. The state knew…but didn’t disclose it.’

With barely concealed outrage Judge Kozinski added: ‘No civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to decide whether to take someone’s life or liberty.’

In a statement seen by MailOnline and submitted by Milke’s mother, Renate Janka, to Maricopa County Court, Mrs Janka said: ‘In view of Judge Kozinski’s Opnion, it becomes less and less bearable what the State of AZ is putting us through.

 ‘For Debbie and I it is a constant mental stress between time left and utmost fear.’

Mrs Janka received the ‘devastating’ diagnosis of third stage Ovarian Cancer in June 2010. She underwent aggressive surgery and chemotherapy but Mrs Janka’s condition is terminal.

Now living in Switzerland, Mrs Janka told of her agony as, two months ago, ‘my phone calls to Debra were cancelled without explanation. Then I was told not to write letters (only postcards), not to mention what the next few weeks will bring us.’

Judge Kozinski has set aside not only the conviction but has also barred the use of the 'so-called confession.'

The facts of the case, such as they were known, were enough to shock America. On the last evening of his life, Chrisopher Milke saw Santa Claus at the mall near the home in Phoenix he shared with his mother and her room-mate James Styers.

He enjoyed it so much he woke the next morning and begged his mother to take him again. Milke, then 25, agreed but asked Styers to take him instead.

On the way Styers picked up his friend Roger Scott. The two men drove the boy to a secluded ravine where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head.

Both Styers and Scott are currently on death row awaiting lethal injection for their part in the killing. 

In the immediate aftermath Scott implicated Milke. He claimed the three had plotted Chrisopher’s killing and planned to split his $50,000 life insurance.

Much was made in trial of Mile’s hatred for Christopher’s father, her ex-husband, Mark ‘Arizona’ Milke and Christopher’s striking physical resemblance to him.

But neither of Milke’s co-accused took the stand at the original trial. Styers  has vociferously maintained hat Milke had nothing to do with the killing that shocked America while Scott recanted his earlier claims.

Speaking to MailOnline, Milke’s Phoenix based attorney, Michael Kimerer said: ‘We have learned from various sources that Styers and Scott continue to maintain that Milke had nothing to do with the killing.’

Both men, he said, have the added incentive of having their death penalties reduced to life sentences if they turn State witnesses.  Yet both continue to maintain Milke’s innocence.
