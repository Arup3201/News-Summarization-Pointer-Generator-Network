Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against a Utah woman accused of killing six babies after giving birth to them, and keeping their bodies in boxes in her garage.

The charges were filed Monday morning shortly before 39-year-old Megan Huntsman appeared in court for the second time. She was informed of the charges during the brief hearing.

Prosecutors say Huntsman is the only suspect in the deaths of the babies.

Charged: Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against Huntsman

The infants dead bodies were found hidden in cardboard boxes in 39-year-old Megan Huntsman's former garage in Pleasant Grove, Utah by her estranged husband.

They say a seventh dead infant found in the garage appears to have been stillborn.

Investigators believe Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, is the babies' father, though they are awaiting DNA results to confirm that. West is not a suspect.

Huntsman is being held on $6 million bail.

Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, discovered one of the infant corpses in the garage of their Pleasant Grove home on April 12. Police then responded and found a total of seven tiny bodies in cardboard boxes.

Police said Huntsman acknowledged that from 1996 to 2006, she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and packed them inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City. She told police a seventh baby was stillborn.

Investigators believe West is the father of the babies, though they are waiting on DNA results to confirm that, Buhman said.

West lived with Huntsman during the decade she says this happened, but he was in federal prison on drug charges from 2006 until January.

Prosecutors said they hope to soon meet again with West, who Buhman said has been cooperative and is not considered a suspect. After an initial interview, West obtained an attorney and has not met with investigators again.

Authorities say they think they know her motive, but they have declined to reveal it publicly.
