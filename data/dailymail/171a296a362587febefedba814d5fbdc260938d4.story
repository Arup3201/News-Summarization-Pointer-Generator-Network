Proud pose: Tory poster boy Afzal Amin, in ceremonial Army uniform, whose political career is in ruins

Afzal Amin was to be the Tories’ poster boy at the General Election. But his political career was in ruins last night as he suffered the shame of being suspended from the party over his self-serving plot to win votes by stirring up racial hatred.

It is a spectacular fall from grace for a politician from a humble background who seemed set for high office with the Conservatives but is now a victim of his over-reaching political ambition.

Amin was the first ethnic minority candidate to be chosen for this year’s poll, and has been pictured alongside Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.

The 40-year-old has appeared on the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme four times and was praised when he spoke out against the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by Islamists, insisting that Muslims were an ‘integral part’ of Britain.

Despite his ambitions, Amin – who is married with two teenage children – has not been afraid to criticise Conservative Party bosses. Last year he admitted that many ethnic minority voters in his target seat of Dudley North, held by a Labour majority of just 649, think that the Tories ‘remain a racist party’.

And he told a newspaper that British society and political leaders as well as community leaders must share the blame for the ‘jihad generation’ that is travelling to Syria to join murderous Islamic State.

His high-profile position with the Conservatives and sought-after views contrast markedly with his humble beginnings. Amin was brought up in the deprived Black Country town of Smethwick, where the Tories had once infamously used openly racist slogans on election leaflets. 

He left school with practically no qualifications and took a series of menial jobs, including being a waiter, before going to university in London as a mature student.

His fortunes changed in 2001 when he was selected to attend training at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He rose to the rank of captain and saw active service in Iraq and did three tours in Afghanistan.

Spokesman: Interviewed on BBC News about the murder of Lee Rigby and the effect on the Muslim community

Later moving into an educational role, he says he was a personal tutor to Princes William and Harry, as well as serving as chairman of the Armed Forces Muslim Association.

After leaving the Army he set up a consultancy called The Curzon Education Ltd, which won a £120,000 grant to give lectures to schoolchildren about the role of Commonwealth soldiers in the First World War. It sparked controversy as the grant was given by the Department for Communities, where his ‘political acquaintance’ Baroness Warsi was a Minister.

Mr Amin worked at the Army’s Counterinsurgency And Stabilisation Centre and has given lectures at the UK Defence Academy. He describes himself on Twitter as ‘International Conflict and Stabilisation Adviser Government Strategist Fragile States.’

On the photosharing website Flickr he posted a picture of himself meeting Sir Nicholas Soames – Winston Churchill’s MP grandson – and wrote: ‘In late 2003 I was working on anti-hijacking operations in Southern Basra. We were visited by Sir Nicholas Soames MP whom I briefed about our work tackling gangs with Iraqi police.’

Harry, Wills... and a vicious assault

Afzal Amin: Yeah he [a reference to a man involved in the 2011 riots] punched a guy in the face. Who hasn’t done that? The difference between you and me is one thing: I haven’t been caught.

LAUGHS

…Even in Windsor, I was Education Officer for Prince Harry and Prince William, I headbutted a guy, his face exploded. But when the police turned up they see me in a suit – cashmere suit with a briefcase and they see this guy hoodie up, cap on.

Male [a friend of Amin]: What was he doing?

AA: Wheeling all over the place... They can’t work out why would the guy in the suit crack that guy?

‘I’m not a Paki, am I?’

AA: I’ll have tandoori prawn for the main. Can you make it as mild as possible?

Waiter: It’s marinated in the spice already.

AA: Yeah can you rinse it off?

Tommy Robinson: You don’t like spicy food?

AA: No, I’m not a Paki am I?

Newsnight boasts

Naim Akhtar [AA’s friend, talking about a Conservative gathering of ‘your white, working class people.’]: Out of all the people that were there Afzal says to me, ‘Let’s wait here, he’ll come to us.’ David Cameron walked up to us and said, ‘Afzal, how are you? How is your campaign?’ We had a good five or 10-minute chat, the way we’re chatting now. Out of all the people in the room...

AA: They know who I am.

Naim: They know him. The only candidate in the whole of the UK who’s been on Newsnight four times.

AA: They’ve already asked me what sort of committees do you want to serve on, they’re that sure I’m going to win.
