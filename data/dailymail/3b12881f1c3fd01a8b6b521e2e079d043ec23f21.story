Perhaps it is no coincidence that Macy's - America's first  modern department store and at one point the world's largest - was also the first known retailer in U.S. history to employ a female executive.

Margaret Getchell, then 22, joined Macy's in 1861 as a clerk, when it still was a struggling New York City store selling ribbons and lace, but quickly impressed its founder Rowland Hussey Macy with her innovative approach to sales.

Four years later, the Massachusetts-born employee was promoted to 'superintendent', an executive-level position, and under her stewardship, Macy's tripled in size. It went from scraping in just $11.06 in sales on its first day, to $1million in annual sales in 1869, and was by then a fully-fledged department store.

According to Facts On File, it was Ms Getchell's idea to branch out from selling fabrics and start selling clothing, toiletries, hats and jewelry; and eventually groceries, toys and household goods.

She was well-known for her legendary window displays and her pioneering marketing ideas.

One of Ms Gretchell's most successful moves was to persuade Mr Macy to install a soda fountain for thirsty customers, buried behind rows and rows of distracting merchandise. Similar tactics are employed today by every department store in the world. 

Another stunt involved dressing up two cats in doll's clothing and plonking them in baby cribs as part of a window display, which predictably pulled in a huge crowd.

Ms Getchell's motto was famously: 'Be everywhere, do everything, and never fail to astonish the customer.'

The story of her record-breaking success began in her home town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, after she quit her job as a schoolteacher to pursue a life in The Big Apple aged 22.

Ms Getchell, who lost her eye in a childhood accident and so had one glass replacement, was a distant cousin of Mr Macy's, which is how she got her entry-level clerk position.

She was said to be excellent with numbers, 'pretty' and extremely hard-working, often staying up into the night to strategize with Mr Macy. Before long, she was promoted to bookkeeper.

According to writer and historian Sean Braswell, an editor at Ozy, Ms Getchell bombarded her boss and cousin relentlessly with new ideas to grow the business, a tactic she liked to call 'putting a bug in his ear.'

Historian Ralph M. Hower wrote a book about the store's background, titled History of Macy's of New York, 1858-1919, and in it claims that Mr Macy attributed 'a large part' of his business' success to Ms Getchell.

'While it was not at all unusual at this time to employ women in retail stores, to give one of them an executive position of such importance seems to have marked a radical departure from normal practice,' Mr Hower wrote.

In 1869, when she 30, Ms Getchell married Abiel La Forge, a friend of Mr Macy's son, who then became a buyer for the store and later a partner.

In an undated letter to his sister, Mr La Forge wrote of his wife: 'She is the Superintendent, having full charge of the entire business.

'As we sell a million dollars-worth of goods a year and have nearly two hundred employees, her position is a very responsible one.'

In an all-too-familiar twist at the time, Ms Getchell was asked to give up her salary after her husband was made a partner.

The couple went on to have six children, and although Ms Getchell gave up her full-time position at Macy's, she often returned to assist with busy periods.

Mr Macy died of kidney disease in 1877 at the age of 54, Mr La Forge died of tuberculosis a year later, and Ms Getchell died of heart failure in 1880, at the age of 38.

Macy's now operates 850 department stores in the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and pulled in $27.7billion in revenue last year. Its current CEO is 62-year-old Terry J. Lundren.

Of its 11 current executive leaders, three are women.

As Mr Braswell points out, it has been 134 years since Ms Getchell's death, and female executives in the retail world are still woefully scant.

He writes: 'With women still controlling the purse strings when it comes to most household purchasing decisions, and the retail industry still struggling post-recession, most of these companies could benefit from smart women like Margaret Getchell putting a bug in their ears.'
