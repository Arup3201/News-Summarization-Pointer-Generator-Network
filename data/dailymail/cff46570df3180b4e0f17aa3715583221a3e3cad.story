A gunman who allegedly killed his wife and shot two pastors in
a church on Sunday killed his previous wife 25 years ago, court records have revealed.

Jeremiah Fogle, 57, was tackled by people attending a prayer
service in Lakeland, Florida yesterday, who took his .32-calibre revolver and held him
down.

Pastor William Boss was shot in the head as he prayed.
Associate pastor Carl Stewart was shot in the shoulder, head and back,
authorities said.

In court: Jeremiah Fogle killed his wife at home before marching into a prayer service at a church he once attended and shooting two clergymen, police said

Shot dead: Fogle and his wife Theresa Brown Fogle, 56, married in 2002 and once attended Greater Faith Christian Center Church as members

Fogle and his wife Theresa Brown Fogle, 56, married in 2002
and once attended Greater Faith Christian Center Church as members.

But they had not been for several years and had started
their own ministry out of their house, regularly hosting their own Sunday
services.

Today it has been revealed he pleaded guilty to manslaughter
in the death of his wife, Diane, but was only sentenced to 10 years’ probation
in 1987.

He allegedly answered the door with a rifle and showed a
police officer her body in 1986. Prosecutors reduced the charge from first-degree
murder.

He handled the rifle in a ‘negligent,
careless and reckless manner,' authorities said at the time. It's not known why the charge was lessened.

Spree: Fogle allegedly stormed into Greater Faith Christian Church in Florida on Sunday morning, shooting pastors William Boss and Carl Stewart

On Sunday, Mrs Fogle's husband had allegedly walked to 
the church from their home nearby. She was later found dead in the living room by officials.

safe, you should be safe in a house of worship. Especially on a Sunday morning'

He entered through the front door of 
Greater Faith Christian Center Church, walked down the centre aisle and 
shot the men, police said.

Fogle was then allegedly restrained by other parishioners until authorities arrived. No other church members were injured.

He had six live rounds in his pocket 
and was prepared to shoot even more before he was tackled by ‘heroes’, 
Sheriff Grady Judd said.

‘We don't know exactly why he went in to this mad rage,’ he added.

Derrick Foster was kneeling in prayer when the gunman burst through the front door of Greater Faith Christian Center Church and he heard shooting then screams.

Mr Foster and another man tackled Fogle and one of the parishioners struck him in the head with a microphone stand, authorities said.

‘He had a great grip on the gun,’ Mr Foster said. ‘My plan was, as soon as he hit the floor, it would cause him to drop it. But he didn't drop it.’

He said it took up to four minutes of struggling with the gunman before he finally wrested the weapon away.

‘He was focused on killing his wife and 
certainly meant to kill the pastor and assistant pastor,’ he 
told the Orlando Sentinel.

The pastor and associate pastor were 
in a critical but stable condition and were being treated for their 
injuries at a local hospital.

Authorities took Fogle into custody on
charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder. They were 
investigating to determine his motive.

During a hearing on Monday, Fogle  was charged with murder and attempted murder after the shootings. He was ordered to be held without bond.

The couple ran a transportation firm 
and his wife had nursed him back to health after he had back surgery, 
Mrs Fogle’s sister Maria Beauford said.

‘We have no idea what his motive was,’ Ms Beauford said. ‘We just have no idea.’

Fogle was known as a community man and could often be seen in his home's front garden with his wife.

Jeremiah Fogle's older brother, Collis Fogle Jr, added: ‘It's so sad. I've been trying to call to figure out what went wrong.’

Authorities said Fogle ran through the
church doors after a morning service had wrapped up and just before 
another daily service.

'We have no idea what his motive was. We just have no idea'

The red-brick building also serves as a
school and sits across from a mobile home park. Several police cars and
tape blocked off the church.

Fogle had a white bandage around his 
head on Sunday night and was led to a patrol car, refusing to speak with
television reporters.

‘Of all the places you should be 
safe, you should be safe in a house of worship,’ Sheriff Judd 
said. ‘Especially on a Sunday morning.’

Fogle is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday.
