Former PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle was charged with a drink driving offence shortly before he was hit by a lorry last week.

The 35-year-old, currently recovering in hospital from the accident that happened in Yorkshire, was pulled over by police in London on December 20, the Sun reported.

Less than 36 hours later the former QPR, Burnley and Leeds defender, who has been building a new career as a TV pundit, was struck by a lorry while walking along a dual carriageway in the dark near his York home.

A Metropolitan police statement confirmed: ‘Clarke Carlisle, 35, was charged on Saturday, 20 December with failing to provide a specimen and driving otherwise in accordance with a licence.

‘He is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on 20 January 2015.’

On Monday, Carlisle’s wife Gemma said she was hopeful he would make a full recovery.

She said on Twitter: ‘Thank you for continuing messages of support and for media restraint.

'Clarke still very poorly but we're hopeful he'll make a full recovery.'

Carlisle's most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division.

As a sign of the Clarets' support for their former player, fans at Turf Moor clapped in the fifth minute of their game against Liverpool on Boxing Day as it correlates with the squad number Carlisle wore at the club.

As well as Burnley, there have also been messages of support for Carlisle from the other clubs he played for, which include Blackpool, QPR, Leeds, Watford and Northampton.

The Football Association, Football League and anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, for which Carlisle is an ambassador, all tweeted their support as well, while representatives from the PFA visited him in hospital.
