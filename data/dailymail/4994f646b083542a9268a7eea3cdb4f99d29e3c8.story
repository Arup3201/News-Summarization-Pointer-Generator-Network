An entrepreneur is making Christmas wishes come true after donating his air miles to those unable to return home for the holidays.

From servicemen and cash-strapped college students to families who have a sick relative and a Marine wanting to propose, 25 round trip flights were handed out by Peter Shankman.

The businessman was originally able to help only six people, but as his goodwill spread, airlines and other companies added to his generosity.

on Twitter on December 2, and the lucky recipients of 25 round-trip 
tickets were selected on Sunday night.

After hearing about his offer, JetBlue stumped up a further 10 flights, and four more people contacted Mr Shankman to offer their air miles to the cause.

'We were just moved by what [Shankman] 
was doing. I think more 
people should support people doing good things,' Morgan Johnston, of JetBlue, said.

Other companies also generously donated a variety of goodies for the worthy winners, including a ScotteVest winter jacket, 
three-month TripIt Pro travel planner subscription, and a subscription to magicJack phone service.

Groundlink also offered ten return trips to and from airports.

'I'm psyched about being able to do this - I'm happy that my lifestyle can wind up helping people,' Mr Shankman said.

Shankman, who flies about 250,000 miles each year, tweeted on December 
9: 'If you're lucky enough to afford what you need, say thanks. 
@mwalker117 and I are crying as we go through the free flight comments.'

details of a planned proposal.

Her daughter had been working extra shifts as a waitress while training to be a teacher to save up for the flight to Washington to see her Marine boyfriend training to work in SpecialOps.

Unbeknown to the daughter, her boyfriend planned to propose on a mountain over the holidays.

'If you could help them make this trip possible it would mean so much more knowing their Blessing would have been a gift from so many people to make this possible. What a better way to start a life together,' the proud mother said.

It is not the first time Mr Shankman has given away flights for the holidays. The seasoned business traveler was able to help four people last year.

He explained his motivation - and how he came to have so many air miles - on his blog.

'I do a ton of travel for work each year. This year saw eight international trips, including the Middle East, three to Asia, and several Europes. And that was only international ... What does all that mean, other than me never getting a good night's sleep? Well, I get a TON of miles,' he said.
