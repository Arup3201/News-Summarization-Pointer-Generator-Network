A cheap and convenient mode of transport, the advantages to travelling by bicycle are numerous.

But what if you're in a real hurry to get somewhere?

That shouldn't pose a problem to teenage inventor Raul Oaida, who has developed a jet engine capable of propelling his mountain bike to speeds of up to 26 miles per hour on a flat road.

The 19-year-old, from Transylvania, spent three years on the project, which he funded through a combination of sponsorship and pocket money.

Today Mr Oaida road tested the jet engine-propelled bicycle for the first time on a road behind his house in the city of Deva, where the spectacle attracted a small crowd of onlookers.

After successfully speeding along the city street on his souped-up cycle, the delighted inventor raised his arms in triumph.

Mr Oaida was following in the footsteps of his fellow Romanian Henri Coanda, a famed inventor.
