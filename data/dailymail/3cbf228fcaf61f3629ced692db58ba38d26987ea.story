A new trailer for a movie about the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has hit the internet just 10 weeks after the plane vanished.

Rupesh Paul Productions touted The Vanishing Act trailer at the Cannes Film Festival to look for prospective investors on Saturday.

It could be in theatres within months as filming is expected to take place over 35 days and have more than 200 actors.

Flight MH370 was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it lost contact with air traffic control on March 8. It was carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers from 14 different countries.

As the search continues for the missing plane, the film’s movie poster claims to tell the ‘untold story’ behind the doomed flight, news.com.au reports.

But based off the trailer it may not be the most accurate account of the tragedy.

A Boeing 747 is used in the trailer instead of a Boeing 777 - the actual model of the plane that disappeared.

The Vanishing Act's associate director Sritama Dutta said the only similarity between the movie and the disaster was it involved a missing plane.

The 90-second trailer casts suspicion on a number of the passengers and crew members aboard.

It hints a male MAS flight attendant could have been responsible for the tragedy that killed 239 people.

In one of the scenes, a male flight attendant is fraught with jealousy when he spies a stolen kiss between a female flight attendant and another male colleague – one of them presumably his love interest.

In another, a creepy male passenger wearing a blue shirt is seen staring down the camera with a look of menace on his face.

As the tension builds, cutaway scenes of crew members being thrown around, passengers looking terrified, a passionate goodbye kiss between two flight attendants and a gun being loaded play out over a generic thriller score.

Rupesh Paul, the man behind the production company, wrote the screenplay in 20 days based on a Malaysian journalist's theory about what happened.

The journalist is one of the film's investors and wants to remain anonymous for now.

Its budget is $3.5 million.

The search for the plane continues in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.
