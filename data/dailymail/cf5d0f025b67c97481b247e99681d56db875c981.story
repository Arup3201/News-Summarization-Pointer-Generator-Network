Paddling directly towards a great white shark would be a surfer's worst nightmare. 

But these two paddle boarders were completely unaware of the potential dangers lurking just metres from them when they took to the surf on the NSW Central Coast last Friday.

Footage shot by drone pilot Tom Caska captured the moment a huge shark started following a sea of fish 50 metres off the shore at Killcare Beach.

Mr Caska's brother Andrew was on one of the three-metre long paddle boards when the shark started circling. 

But remarkably, no one was fully aware of how close he came until they looked back on the drone footage.

'Andie had a heart attack when he saw this... Scary stuff,' Mr Caska wrote on Facebook.

The shark, believed to be a great white, and the school of fish are clearly visibly in the aerial photo just metres from several surfers.

Mr Caska said his brother was paddling over a wave and only saw 'a bit of a swirl', but no sign of the shark. 

'Came in after that big school of fish. Must be careful in the water this time of year as the whites migrate south again,' he wrote. 

It comes after a 50-year-old man was killed after a suspected great white attacked him at Byron Bay earlier this month. 

Paul Wilcox was swimming 15-metres from shore on the main beach when a shark mauled his leg.

The shark was photographed 50 metres off the shore at Killcare Beach, south of Gosford on the Central Coast
