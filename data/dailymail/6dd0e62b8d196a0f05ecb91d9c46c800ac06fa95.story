'He eats more and more, and his weight is putting on at a shocking speed. 

'Although we tried many ways to stop him from eating too much, nothing has worked. 

He said he has tried to help his son lose weight by encouraging sports, traditional Chinese medicines, practicing Kung Fu, receiving weight control therapies and having acupuncture.

But he said each time he loses a few pounds the weigh would bounce back and be even higher.

Xu when he was younger - slowly the weight has crept on and he now needs medical help

Xu will now undergo weightloss surgery. 

According to medical guidelines gastric band surgery can only be done on people who are over 16 years old, but an exception is being made in Xu's case because there are fears for his immediate health. 

The surgery and follow-up treatment are expected to cost around 300,000 Yua (£28,000).
