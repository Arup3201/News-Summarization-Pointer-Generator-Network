The BBC drama controller Ben Stephenson has said there are not enough gay characters on TV

The BBC drama controller has said there are not enough gay characters on TV. 

Ben Stephenson, who is himself gay, called on writers to come forward with more stories which focus on homosexuality. 

The comments were made during the BBC's Reflect and Represent talk at New Broadcasting House on Monday which aims to discuss the Corporation's future vision. 

Mr Stephenson said: 'I am diverse, in that sense (gay), and are there many portrayals of gay characters on television? I would say it's probably one of the lowest (represented) areas. 

'When the great gay script comes in, I shall definitely be commissioning it.' 

Despite Mr Stephenson believing there is diversity in BBC drama he said there is still 'a long way to go'. 

Mr Stephenson was appointed controller of BBC drama in 2008. 

Last month Eastenders character Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) broke down in tears as he revealed to his father Mick (Danny Dyer) that he is gay. 

Johnny's sexuality was first revealed by his sister Nancy (Maddy Hill) during an explosive family argument at the Queen Vic - where Mick is landlord.

Despite Nancy regretting her revelation and attempting to then deny it, Johnny makes the brave decision to come clean and tell his parents the truth.

The episode showed Johnny sobbing into his father's shoulder before Mick is seen apparently reassuring is son that he made the right decision by coming out.

The big reveal: Sam Strike's EastEnders character Johnny Carter will be seen revealing to father Mick (Danny Dyer) that he is gay in Friday night's episode of the BBC soap

Johnny's coming out comes after the New Year's Day episode of the show saw him kiss Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), in a scene which prompted several complaints on social media.

One person wrote: 'Danny dyers son............ Is gay? Never cringed so much from eastenders! That's not good. Poor danny.'

And another added: '‘#EastEnders was a disgrace. No wonder it was on after 9. Kids watch this program. Being gay is wrong and it shouldn't be promoted #Dirty.'

However, others applauded the show for introducing more gay characters and diversifying its storylines.

It's alright, son: Mick reassures his son after he tearfully comes out following sister Nancy first dropping the bombshell the night before during a family row at the Queen Vic

Pete Lawson, who write the episode, said on Twitter: '2014, and gay teens kissing on a soap still draws complaints. 

'Makes me even prouder to have written that ep.' 

Another writer on the soap, Daran Little, also tweeted: '10 years ago Coronation Street had complaints when I wrote Todd kissing Nick... now complaints about EastEnders gay kiss... no progress.

Christopher and his Kind with Douglas booth as Heinz Neddermayer and Matt Smith as Christopher Isherwood was a one-off drama with gay characters

'I thinks it's encouraging that Hollyoaks gay kisses don't get complaints, cos its viewers are young and accepting,' he wrote. 

Amanda Rice, head of diversity, told Broadcast: 'Reflect and Represent is about recognising that more needs to be done, exploring how we can all achieve greater impact celebrating the progress we have made. 

'We want to make sure that all staff have the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas.' 

Gay author Tom Rob Smith is writing a new drama about a gay spy for the BBC. 

The story will look at Danny, described as a ‘gregarious, hedonistic, but ill-equipped spy’ who falls for the ‘anti-social and enigmatic’ Alex.

The drama will be going into production later this year and is expected to be lined up to air in 2015.
