Leicester City have completed the signing of Queens Park Rangers defender Danny Simpson from QPR.

The 27-year-old joined Rangers last summer, and played 34 games in the Championship to help the club achieve promotion to the Premier League, but he has now moved to the Foxes on a three-year-deal.

Right-back Simpson will take the No 17 shirt at the King Power Stadium and could make his debut against Arsenal on Sunday.

The arrival on loan of Chilean wing back Mauricio Isla had left the former Newcastle defender surplus to requirements at Loftus Road.

Foxes boss Nigel Pearson told the club's website: 'I'm really pleased that we have been able to secure a defender of Danny's quality. He will add more good competition to our squad, which is very healthy for the group.

'He already knows a number of our players from his time with Manchester United and he is the kind of character we look for, so I'm sure he will settle in quickly.'

And Simpson commented: 'I'm really excited. I've had a look around the facilities, which look fantastic, and had a good chat with the manager, who I'm really looking forward to working with.

'He told me that there's a good group of players here that demand a lot of each other and I think, from speaking to other people, he knows I'll work hard every day to fit into that. I've got a really good feeling about this.' 

Nigel Pearson's Leicester team have conceded four goals in their first two league games, and it is hoped Simpson will help to shore things up at the back.  

Committed: QPR manager Harry Redknapp said Simpson had done 'a great job for us last year' before move
