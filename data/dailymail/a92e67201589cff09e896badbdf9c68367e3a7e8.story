Tim Cahill is widely regarded as a deadly marksman in front of goal, but the former Everton star outdid himself with an audacious pass following a recent Socceroos game.

Cahill was being watched from the stands by his 10-year-old son Shae following Australia's game against Kuwait in the AFC Asian Cup.

When the ex-Milwall forward heard his son shouting from high up in the stands, he proceeded to fire a pin-point pass into the arms of the youngster.

Cahill, who now plies his trade in the MLS with the New York Red Bulls, scored one of the goals of the tournament at last summer's World Cup in Brazil when he fired in an unstoppable volley for the Socceroos against Holland.

The 34-year-old striker was the talk of tournament after his left foot wonder strike in Austrlalia's 3-2 defeat to the Dutch in Porto Alegre.

Australia's greatest ever footballer? It's hard to argue with that title after watching his recent display of skill and accuracy.

Cahill's wonder goal could not prevent his team from crashing 3-2 to the Dutch in Port Allegre
