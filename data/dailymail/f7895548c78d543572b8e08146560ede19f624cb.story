On trial: Nicole Baukus is facing two charges of vehicular homicide after driving the wrong way up a Texas highway. Her trial began this week

Footage from a Texas bar shows a 23-year-old woman consuming 21 drinks before she drove home the wrong way down a highway, killing two teenagers in a head-on crash.

Nicole Baukus, from Spring, is facing up to 60 years in prison if found guilty of two counts of vehicular homicide and one count of vehicular assault.

A court was told this week that Baukus drank four bottled beers and 21 'shooters', or spirit mixers, in about four and a half hours, before getting in her pick up truck and causing the fatal crash.

Prosecutors at her trial this week showed video footage of Baukus drinking at the On the Rox sports bar and of her pick up truck traveling the wrong way down a highway in Conroe, on June 29, last year.

As an emergency physician who attended to the two victims in the crash testified to their grievous injuries, Baukus broke down in court Wednesday -- so much so that a 10 minute recess was called.

District Court Judge Michael T. Seiler then warned her not to repeat the behavior.

'We can’t have that kind of disruption,' he said.

She is accused of crashing head on into a car being driven by Nicole Adams, killing the 19-year-old and her back seat passenger, Travis Sanders, 18, according to KHOU News.

A third passenger, 21-year-old David Porras, was seriously injured in the crash, which happened just before 3am.

In court yesterday, prosecutors played emergency calls from other drivers as they reported seeing a pick up truck traveling the wrong way.

Before police could stop Baukus, the 
fatal collision took place. An hour after the crash her blood-level 
alcohol was more than three times the legal limit. Prosecutors also 
claim she had drugs in her system. 

Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission agent Oscar Williams told the court 
Baukus had consumed beer and shooters at On the Rox, from 9:19pm to 
1:46am.

He said that a
tray of shooters was seen being delivered to her table just after 
midnight, which violated the Texas commission's rules, according to The Courier of Montgomery County.

Deadly: Baukus is accused of slamming headlong into Adams' car, pictured, causing two deaths and critically injuring 21-year-old David Porras

Baukus is charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault. She pleaded not guilty on all counts

Crime scene: The pick up truck allegedly driven the wrong way up a highway by Nicole Baukus

Trashed: Debris littered the Texas highway around the accused woman's car

'Only two open beverages can be sold to one customer at a time,' he said.

In April the bar agreed to a $1 million settlement for Mr Porras, who is still having surgery from injuries caused in the crash, and to the estate of Miss Adams and Mr Sanders.

Porras has had 13 operations since the accident and has no teeth in his upper jaw after the bone was smashed when he hit the dashboard.

Put away? If convicted, Baukus would likely have to serve at least half her time before parole is even considered

Busted: Baukus' car after the deadly June 2012 crash. Prosecutors say she is on video taking 17 shots and drinking four beers prior to the crash

Emotions high: Baukus broke down as a physician who attended to the two victims testified Wednesday and was admonished by the judge

Serious charges: Baukus' truck following the June 29, 2012 accident. Prosecutors in the case are trying to prove the truck was a deadly weapon, which would make her ineligible for parole until at least half her sentence is served

Survivor: The surviving passenger of Nicole Adams' car, David Porras, now has no teeth in his upper jaw and has undergone 13 operations since the crash

Baukus' trial is expected to last five days. She faces decades behind bars if convicted

Wasted: An hour after the crash that left two dead and one grievously injured, Baukaus' blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit

The bar was sued for violating the 
Texas Dram Shop Liability Act, which provides a cause of action against 
any bar that serves an obviously intoxicated adult, the Villager reported.

At
her vehicular manslaughter trial, prosecutor Andrew James told the 
court: 'As the trooper was questioning her, he noticed she would just 
randomly be laughing at times, like this was all one big joke.'

Baukus denies the charges, according to Montgomery County Police Reporter. The trial is expected to last five days.
