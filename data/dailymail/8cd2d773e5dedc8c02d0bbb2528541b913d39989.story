da Vinci or not? The younger Mona Lisa is seen in a vault in Onex near Geneva

Experts appeared confident yesterday when they unveiled a younger version of the Mona Lisa, claiming they could prove the painting was an original da Vinci, portraying perhaps the most-famous smile in humanity in her younger years.

The Zurich-based Mona Lisa Foundation unveiled what is known as the 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' to the public, and said mathematical analysis proved it was the hand of the Master at work here.

But other experts remain unconvinced, with Oxford professor Martin Kemp telling the BBC there is 'no basis for thinking that there was an earlier portrait'.

He said: 'The Isleworth Mona Lisa mistranslates subtle details of the original, 
including the sitter’s veil, her hair, the translucent layer of her 
dress, the structure of the hands.

'The landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety. The head, like all 
other copies, does not capture the profound elusiveness of the 
original.

'The scientific analysis can at most state that there is nothing to say 
that this cannot be by Leonardo. The infrared reflectography and X-ray 
points very strongly to its not being by Leonardo.'

The Mona Lisa Foundation begs to differ.

'So far, not 
one scientific test has been able to disprove that the painting is by 
Leonardo,' said art historian Stanley Feldman.

'We have used methods that were not available to Leonardo 500 years ago.

'When we do a very elementary mathematical test, we have discovered that all of the elements of the two bodies - the two people, the two sitters - are in exactly the same place.

It strikes us that in order for that to be so accurate, so meticulously exact, only the person who did one did the other ... It's an extraordinary revelation in itself, and we think it's valid.'

Secret smile: The latest researchers suggest that da Vinci's handiwork is on display in both paintings

The Isleworth painting - likewise a portrait of a young woman with an enigmatic smile - is slightly larger, was painted on canvas and has brighter colors than the famed Louvre Museum masterpiece painted on wood.

The posture, folded hand positions, faces, expressions and clothing are similar, while the landscape in the background is different.

The foundation says the painting turned up in the home of an English nobleman in the late 1800s - thus the connection to Isleworth - and was shipped to the United States for safekeeping during World War I.

After the war, it was analysed in Italy, and eventually taken to Switzerland where it remained in a bank vault for the last 40 years, the group said.

The Isleworth Mona Lisa has been known publicly for generations - if forgotten by the broader public - and the book excerpts numerous news headlines about the painting and the possibility of its Da Vinci connection in the early 20th century.

The Gioconda is an alternative title 
for the Mona Lisa; Mona is an abbreviation of ‘Ma donna’, or My Lady, 
while Gioconda is Italian for the jocund, or happy, one.

The sitter’s real name is in fact thought to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a rich Florence silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo.

On
 Leonardo’s death in 1519, the picture — the Louvre’s version, that is —
 was left to his assistant, Salai, who in turn sold it to King Francis I
 of France.

The painting remained in the royal  collection until the French Revolution in 1789, when it was moved to the Louvre.

There it has remained ever since, with
 a few notable absences. Napoleon kept it in his bedroom in the 
Tuileries Palace and, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, it was 
transferred for safekeeping to the Arsenal in Brest.

During
 World War II, it migrated all over France to avoid damage. It has also 
been on tour to New York and Washington, Tokyo and Moscow.

But
 the picture’s biggest excursion was in 1911, when it was stolen by an 
Italian Louvre worker, called Vincenzo Peruggia, who wanted it returned 
 to Italy.

He pulled off 
the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way: hiding in a broom 
cupboard during the day, then slipping out after closing time, the Mona 
Lisa stuffed under his coat.

He
 kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he 
brazenly tried to flog the picture to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.

That wasn’t the end of Mona Lisa’s 
troubles. In 1956, the poor old girl was first scarred with acid, and 
then attacked with a rock.

Bulletproof
 glass protected it when, in 1974, a disabled woman, protesting against 
the Louvre’s policy on handicapped visitors, threw red paint at the 
picture.

The glass again 
saved the picture only three years ago, when an angry Russian woman, 
denied French  citizenship, threw a teacup at the painting.

Meanwhile,
 the other supposed Mona Lisa gathered dust in a Swiss bank vault, where
 it has rested for 40 years. After Pulitzer’s death, he left the picture
 to his girlfriend and, on her death, the Swiss consortium bought it.
