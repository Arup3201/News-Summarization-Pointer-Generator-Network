Zafar Rushdie, 35, was more than twice the legal limit when he was discovered unconscious by officers in his car just yards from his flat.

Salman Rushdie’s son has been convicted of drink-driving after police found him asleep at the wheel of his BMW at traffic lights.

Zafar Rushdie, 35, was more than twice the legal limit when he was discovered unconscious by officers in his car just yards from his flat.

The celebrity publicist, who announced his engagement to classical singer Natalie Coyle this summer, was suffering from ‘personal relation issues’ at the time, a court heard.

Rushdie’s lawyer pleaded for leniency on the grounds that the conviction could affect his ability to visit the United States, where he was planning to marry his fiancée next year.

Magistrates banned him from driving for 17 months as well as fining him £720 and ordering him to take a drink-driving course.

The eldest child of the Booker Prize-winning author, Rushdie trades on his famous surname through his PR agency Rushdie Media.

As a young boy he lived for 11 years under the shadow of the fatwah placed on his father’s head after the outcry in the Islamic world over his controversial novel The Satanic Verses.

Rushdie was arrested on August 1 after police found his car stopped at traffic lights in upmarket Hampstead, north London.

The officers became suspicious when the lights turned green twice and the vehicle made no attempt to move off and so knocked on the window, Highbury Corner Magistrate’s Court in London heard.

Prosecutor Emily Maunders said: ‘They could see the defendant, he was described as either being asleep or having a medical episode. They banged on the window and there was no response.

‘They continued on four or five occasions to bang on the window. He then appeared to wake, and he appeared confused and under the influence.’

Rushdie was arrested and given a test, which found he had 182mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80mg.

The Exeter University graduate, who pleaded guilty to drink driving, was caught just 100 yards from his front door in Hampstead, where he shares a garden flat with Coyle, 28, the court heard.

His lawyer, Mark Haslam, who has previously represented Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and various sporting stars for driving offences, said Rushdie found his time in police custody a ‘salutary experience’.

But he added: ‘The defendant does not accept that he was deeply asleep. The brake lights were on, he was in control of the vehicle. The officers exaggerated things. He clearly was distracted.

In this case this is genuinely a person who has acted in a way that is out of character.’

Rushdie was arrested two days before he was due to take part in the London Triathlon, as part of a year-long fundraising campaign to run 15 half-marathons and triathlons in support of children’s charity Kids Company.

Mr Haslam said: ‘He works in public relations and he had personal relation issues of his own which were troubling him. He is a regular raiser of money for charity. He had been working very hard. He was tired.

‘He took a decision to drive back from work at Portland Place to stop with some friends and have a drink. That was a flawed decision in itself. It was not a sensible decision.

‘It was compounded by a further decision to drive the familiar mile home. It is perfectly clear that he was at least distracted by these issues.’

Appealing for a lenient sentence, the lawyer added: ‘There is a personal issue - travel to the US would be a trouble. He spends his time raising money for various charities and the way he raises that money is not the easiest way.

‘I ask you to take that into account. If anyone needed his previous good character to come to their rescue it is this defendant.’

But chairman of the bench Mark Beattie said the court had no discretion and had to disqualify Rushdie from driving. He said the ban would be reduced by 17 weeks if he successfully completed a drink driving course.
