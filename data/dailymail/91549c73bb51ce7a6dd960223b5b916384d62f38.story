We’ve all heard of ‘wing men’, now it’s time to meet the ‘wing women.’

As it has been revealed that more than three quarters of British ladies now have a ‘pulling partner’ for nights out to help keep them safe, break the ice and even escape from dud dates.

According to new research from drinks brand, Lambrini, the ideal candidate has to be funny, friendly but shockingly, not too good-looking.

More than 50 per cent of women pick a friend who is uglier than them as a wing-woman

More than half of those quizzed said they deliberately choose ugly friends to make sure they get the pick of the fit fellas.

While four out of ten want a pal there to rate blokes and strike up conversations.

But when things go wrong, it seems it’s the wing woman’s duty to come to the rescue.

A secret SOS phrase between pulling partners was the most popular mode of escape from boring blokes (45 per cent) followed by pretending to go to the bathroom (29 per cent).

A further third admitted asking their wing woman to send them a fake ‘there’s an emergency text’ or communicating with hand signals when they wanted to get away from a less than scintillating suitor.

But things don’t always go to plan, and one in seven of us have been caught using secret codes to get out of boring dates.

Speaking about the findings, Lambrini spokesperson, Lorna Tweed, said: 'Everyone knows that the modern dating scene can be an absolute minefield and we all need a little support if we’re going to find our Prince Charming.

'Men have been boasting about their wing men for years, now women have realised it’s a great idea too.

'It’s nice to see women sticking together and helping each other out. Not only does it make dates safer but makes it easier to escape if things aren’t working out.'
