Sachin Tendulkar has poured cold water on any lingering hope that England may spring a surprise at next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

The 41-year-old, speaking at Lord’s during the launch of his new autobiography 'Playing It My Way', doesn't see Peter Moores's side competing Down Under in February.

England face India in a triangular series in Australia ahead of February's showpiece - one they are expected to struggle in given the turmoil to have engulfed the team over the last 12 months.

And Tendulkar - almost a year to the day since his final Test match against the West Indies - can’t think of any reason for those gloomy predictions to be wrong.

'I don't think so, sorry,' he said when asked of England's chances. 'Anything is possible in this sport but going by the current form I don't think England will be that competitive.’

They are in disarray having won just one one-day international series this year - that came against the equally shambolic West Indies in March - and serious questions remain over who will make the plane or whether captain Alastair Cook should be on it.

Scotland coach Paul Collingwood is even plotting their downfall when the sides meet on February 23 in Christchurch.

'I can't pinpoint one team but there are a few competitive teams. I'd like to name Australia, South Africa... New Zealand are a dark horse. India. I think these four would be my semi-finalists,’ Tendulkar added.

'I feel India can surprise a lot of guys and believe the spinners will come into play. You talk about pitches conducive to fast bowlers but because of the size of the grounds I think spinners will come into it.’

His book is dedicated to 'all of my fellow Indians' and the former batsman speaks glowingly about the emergence of the IPL - although admitting initial doubts over its legitimacy in terms of quality - while also documenting the anguish he felt in search of a hundredth 100.

The varying merits of the three formats have been hotly debated in his homeland, but Tendulkar - who has scored more runs and centuries than anyone else - left it in no doubt his preferred form.

Sachin Tendulkar was speaking at his book launch in Canary Wharf in London on Friday

It has been a year since India legend Tendulkar retired from cricket after a lengthy career

'Test cricket will always be right at the top,' he added. 'I think for Test cricket we had some decent crowds. If you go to most of the players they will back Test cricket as No 1.

'Twenty20 has opened up a bigger audience. 'Somebody who likes T20 can be converted.

'Its impossible to keep each format a popular as each other. T20 is exciting and allows you to be innovative. In Test cricket batsmen are prepared to play reverse sweeps. I don't remember anyone bowling slower ball bouncers in the 90s.'

Tendulkar made it clear he had not published a book in order to create headlines and had just one line on Kevin Pietersen's recently-published autobiography: 'I think certain things should stay in the dressing room.'
