An 11-year-old, basketball-mad boy with a rare orthopedic condition is getting his wish to have his leg amputated and allow him to live a richer life.

Amit Vigoda, who lives in San Francisco, was born with congenital pseudoarthrosis of tibia and fibula with osteofibrous dysplasia, an agonizing condition which causes his right leg to continually fracture.

He is in constant pain and can only walk with crutches, hop on one foot or crawl. Amit's condition is so excruciating that it wakes him in the middle of the night, screaming for his mother.

Amit Vigoda, 11, has made the difficult but brave decision to have his right leg amputated below the knee. He suffers from a rare condition which causes his leg to continually fracture, leaving him in agonizing pain

His mother Zimra Vigoda, who has three other children, wrote on her blog on parenting site Kveller: 'I awake to a familiar screech. ''Mommmmmyyyy……HELP!'' So begins my biweekly sleep-run to my 11-year-old’s bedside.

'''Mommmmmyyyy……I want to cut it off, I can’t stand it anymore…I hate my leg… make it stop,'' he hollers, eyes wide open yet not quite awake.'

Doctors diagnosed Amit with the rare condition when he was born with a broken leg.

Amit has had multiple surgeries to correct the problem including internal rods and an 'external fixation' which saw rods, nuts and bolts fitted through the child's bone, muscle and tissue, his mother explained. The solution lasted only a year before the leg fractured again. 

Following one surgery aged nine, Amit was left in a wheelchair for seven months and had to learn to walk again with a brace. 

After years of watching her son suffer and swaying back and forth between encouraging her son to keep his leg and sacrificing the limb, the family reached a decision together.

Despite many surgeries, Amit's leg has fractured continually since he was a baby. The 11-year-old has since decided to have his right leg amputated below the knee

Amit, who was born in Israel and moved to the Bay area 18 months ago, is due to have his below-the-knee amputation on April 10 at Shriner’s Hospital for Children in Sacramento, California.

Six weeks later, he will be fitted for a prosthetic and within three months, it's hoped that Amit will be able to live the life he always dreamed - walking, running, playing soccer and hiking.

Mrs Vigoda wrote: 'Now the die is cast, and his amputation surgery is scheduled for early April. This decision was not entirely mine–it was ours.

'Amit has chosen this route and his father and I, along with our family and friends, will be there with him.'

Amit Vigoda adores playing wheelchair basketball and will return to the sport following his operation in April to pursue his dream of playing in the Paralympics

Following his operation, Amit will return to playing his beloved wheelchair basketball, which his mom describes as the most important thing in his life.

The 11-year-old calls his coach Trooper Johnson his 'number one inspiration' and dreams of playing basketball in college or at the Paralympics.

On his own blog, Amit wrote: 'This spring, I will take a huge step in this journey and amputate my right foot... This will allow me to live a much richer life and be more active and do more of what I love - soccer, running, biking, swimming and so on.

'I can tell you now that I am scared. This whole thing is freaking me out. I will probably not be as polite, or charismatic as I would like to appear but I promise you this - I will be candid and I will be real.'
