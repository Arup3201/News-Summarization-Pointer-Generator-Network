A nightclub staged an Ebola-themed Halloween student party last night where revellers were advised to go to the bar for ‘decontamination and quarantine’.

Bar Risa in Birmingham has admitted making a ‘huge error’ after coming under fire over the event - and said it plans to donate profits from last night's event to the Doctors Without Borders charity.

An advert declared that the local area had been ‘infected’ by the deadly disease and that the World Health Organisation (WHO) wanted students to go to the bar for ‘decontamination and quarantine’.

'Prepare for decontamination': Signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a 'Safe zone'

Causing uproar: Scores of horrified people took to social media to criticise the event in Birmingham last night

The bar on Broad Street was decked out for the occasion with fake biohazard tape reading ‘Quarantine’ and signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a ‘Safe zone’.

Promotions staff and bar tenders were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear and party-goers, many dressed as zombies, had to walk through a ‘decontamination tunnel’ to gain access.

The bad-taste party held last night comes as the WHO confirmed that nearly 5,000 people have died from Ebola, the fatal disease which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Scores of horrified people took to social media to criticise the event. Min Jhitta wrote: ‘Bar Risa are having an 'Ebola breakout party' for Halloween? That's disgusting and so disrespectful.’

Jason Alexander tweeted: ‘So Bar Risa in Brum held an Ebola themed Halloween party... #classy.’

Another Twitter user, going by the name of NoWalkITPark, said: ‘I cannot begin to put into words how bad taste and insensitive this Ebola party is. You are a complete bunch of idiots.’

A spokesman for Bar Risa said: ‘The event was run by a third party promoter and we can only apologise for such a huge error of judgement on our part in letting them run the event.

‘We will be donating all profits to Doctors Without Borders and we wholeheartedly apologise to anyone we have offended.’

MailOnline reported on Sunday how websites and bars appeared to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers  treating those who are infected.

The costume appeared on the Brands On Sale website, and a description said: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.'
