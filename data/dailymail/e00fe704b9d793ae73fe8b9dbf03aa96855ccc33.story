David Moyes has likened Louis van Gaal's first defeat as Manchester United manager to his own struggles at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal took over from the Scot in the summer after a terrible campaign with Moyes at the helm - but the Dutchman's arrival couldn't sort the Reds out straight away with United falling to a 2-1 defeat to Swansea.

And United flop Moyes says Van Gaal is suffering the same problems he did during his year in charge - and has urged United bosses to stick with their man and to give him the time Moyes did not enjoy.

'What happened today  happened to me against West Brom, Newcastle, and Everton last year,' Moyes said. 'Every team in the Premier League is very organised now and quite often it’s the special players that win you the games.'

Moyes backed Van Gaal to do what he couldn't do by revamping the United squad from the Sir Alex Ferguson era. 

'Everybody knew it was going to take time,' he told BeIn Sports. 'Taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson for anybody, it would take time.

'Louis van Gaal will need the time to do the job as well. He’ll need to have that opportunity to change things and get a team he wants.' 

Give us a wave: Will Van Gaal get the time at Old Trafford that Moyes says he needs?
