Author Elizabeth Jane Howard has died at the age of 90, her publicist said.

Her fifth novel in The Cazalet Chronicles, All Change, had been published just under two months ago.

The highly-acclaimed series, which had been adapted for a BBC television series and most recently for BBC Radio 4, told the tale of an upper-middle class family in England during and after the Second World War.

She had started writing about the Cazalets some 30 years ago, on the advice of her stepson Martin Amis.

Howard continued to write every day, saying in an interview with The Observer last year: 'Well, it's the thing that gets me up in the morning.'

The novelist, who was made a CBE in 2002 and published her autobiography Slipstream the same year, died at her home in Bungay, Sussex.

She married three times, including to fellow author Kingsley Amis, and is survived by her daughter.

Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow was one of many to pay tribute.

He wrote on Twitter: 'The wonderful Elizabeth Jane Howard (novelist) died today at 90: She watched C4News EVERY night all the way through: Here's to a great lady!'
