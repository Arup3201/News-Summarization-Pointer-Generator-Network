Outspoken: London Mayor Boris Johnson sparked a row by criticising Google over its tax contributions

London Mayor Boris Johnson has said that not paying enough corporation tax has left internet giant Google with a PR headache.

Mr Johnson said that by paying more tax the biggest multinational companies would be showing 'a greater commitment to society'.

The mayor sparked a row with the company after he singled it out for criticism in a speech to businessmen last week where he said it was 'absurd' that large corporations are getting away with minimal tax contributions while poorly paid workers are forced to pay increasingly higher levies.

And his comments were met with a fierce rebuke from the company's vice president Matt Britten who hit out at Johnson for not doing enough to support technology companies.

He also attacked the mayor for 'not getting his facts right' by claiming Google paid "zero" tax when it paid £6 million on UK sales of £2.5 billion.

The row comes as Mr Johnson continues a six day tour of India which is aimed at boosting trade links with London and the UK.

Apart from Bangalore, Hyderabad is the emerging silicon valley of India and Mr Johnson specifically visited the city to promote stronger links between it and London's expanding high-tech industry.

But the outspoken mayor stood by his initial criticisms, claiming Google had a PR problem.

He said: 'My point is very simple: we all need Google, we all love Google. But here's the thing, it seems to me the point stands.

'You either change your tax arrangements or, as I have repeatedly said, great corporations that live and work and profit from the society that they are in should do a little bit more.

'People don't have to change. It's perfectly correct that the law as it stands can be used in that way.

'They have got a PR problem and the way to address that, because people feel a company like Google makes shed-loads of money, is by showing a greater commitment to society.'

The spat started when Mr Johnson spoke to members of the Confederation of British Industry last week.

He said then: 'We should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash-poor people who happen to inhabit expensive houses in London when firms like Google are paying zero.

'Neither arrangement strikes me as being fair and so Google and co face a very clear choice - they can either change their tax arrangements or do much more to serve our society by visibly taking on 18 to 24-year-olds who are out of work.'

But speaking to Channel 4 News last night, Mr Britten said the mayor should look at the 'broader contribution' made by Google to the economy, which included the support of start-up companies.

He added: 'It's frustrating that the mayor of London, who is a great champion of the financial services industry, isn't championing the technology sector, which has the chance to provide the next wave of growth for London and the UK.'
