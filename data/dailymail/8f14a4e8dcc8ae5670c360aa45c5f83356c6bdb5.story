A man claiming benefits for severe chest problems has been jailed after making £500,000 from a pirate DVD empire he ran using a secret room in his country home.

Lester Hawkes, 58, pocketed £74,000 in handouts over two years after claiming he had breathing difficulties.

At the same time Hawkes was running a website with his wife Pauline, 53, which sold bootlegged copies of blockbuster movies, music albums and console games, from his £300,000 country home in the village of Scarisbrick, near Southport, Merseyside.

While Lester Hawkes claimed £74,000 over two years for severe chest problems, he and his wife Pauline were making £65,000 a year from the illegal sale of games, DVDs and music

During a raid officers found Hawkes had 
been hiding his illegal products in a secret room under a trap door in 
the hallway, covered by a rug.

The website made the couple an extra £65,000 a year for seven years and allowed them to lead an affluent lifestyle in a four-bedroom detached house with large plasma screen televisions and fish tanks costing around £2,000 each - while leaving the tax payer to pick up the £640 monthly rent.

The operation was uncovered by a joint operation involving police and investigators from the British Recorded Music Industry and Federation Against Copyright Theft.

A box of CDs recovered during the operation. The couple would spend £500 a week on the latest music to make thousands of copies

At Liverpool Crown Court, Hawkes, who has three children and one grandson, was jailed for three years and ten months after he admitted five counts of benefit fraud.

He also pleading guilty to two counts of the supply and sale of copyright and patented articles and two counts of money laundering.

His wife was given a prison sentence of 21 months, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to two counts of money laundering and five counts of benefit fraud.

The court heard the couple, who married in 1998, set up their website Flying Warlocks after Hawkes got the idea at a computer fair.

They would spend £500 a week on the latest music to make thousands of copies, which they would sell on the internet for a fraction of the retail price.

Customers buying goods from Flying Warlocks - which also had links to two other similar webpages called Wizard and Misty - could sign up to become a member and pay £10 a month to enjoy discounts on the tens of thousands of products for sale, including pornographic films.

The total value of the 58,000 black market products would have been £1,254,726.06 if each item was purchased separately on the high street.

The raids occurred in December 2010 after traders the Hawkes dealt with were caught by investigators.

In one of the bedrooms investigators found CD and DVD recording equipment, master copies of music albums and films and blank disks for recording.

In mitigation for Hawkes, defence counsel Mr David Potter said: 'His health is a serious concern, he had a bout of cancer and suffers from the early onset of Parkinson’s disease.

'He has a further scan on July 26. It is clear that over the years his health has significantly deteriorated.'

But passing sentence Judge Robert Warnock told Hawkes: 'You were one of the controlling minds and operators behind a very substantial fraudulent enterprise.

'While I have no doubt others were involved, I am also clear that you were at or near the top of the managerial structure involved. This was a cynical manipulation of the state benefit system while you were unlawfully enriching yourself from criminal proceedings.'

Hawkes was also ordered to pay back £3,190 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

After the case Det Supt Jason Hudson of the police North West Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'This couple were living a really comfortable lifestyle on the back of proceeds from trade in counterfeit products, whilst also committing benefit crime.

'I am pleased to see that justice has been served. The trade in counterfeit products damages legitimate businesses as well as funding criminality and is often linked to serious and organised crime.'

BPI Director of Anti-Piracy David Wood said: 'The prison sentence handed down in this case demonstrates that those who produce and sell counterfeit goods are not beyond the law.

'Their actions defraud musicians and undermine legitimate high street retailers and independent record stores in these difficult economic times.

'The record business loses millions each year as a result of the black market in fake CDs and DVDs, damaging investment in new artists who want to build a successful career in music.'

Minister for Welfare Reform, Lord Freud, added: 'Benefit fraud costs the taxpayer around £1billion every year. This money is intended to help those most in need not line the pockets of criminals.

'That’s why we’re reforming the benefits system, and making it less open to abuse.'
