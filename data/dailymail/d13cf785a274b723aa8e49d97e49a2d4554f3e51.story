The adopted son of Jerry Sandusky has detailed the agonising seven years of sexual abuse he allegedly suffered at the hands of his father in an audio recording released today.

Matt Sandusky, now 33, came forward during his father's child sex abuse trial, which ended last week with the disgraced former Penn State football coach convicted of 45 of 48 charges.

In a recorded statement to Pennsylvania State Police, he detailed sporadic instances of abuse that he claimed took place between the ages of eight and 15 at the Sandusky home.

In the 29-minute recording, which was obtained by NBC News, Matt Sandusky said the ordeal led him to try 
suicide, saying: 'I know that I really wanted to die in that point in 
time.'

He said that Jerry Sandusky abused 
him 'with, like, the showering, with the hugging, with the rubbing, with
the.. just the talking to me, the way he spoke.'

He recalled how his adopted father would blow raspberries on his stomach and touch his genitals.

Matt Sandusky said that he would sometimes pretend to be asleep and stay in the fetal position to avoid being touched.

His attorneys confirmed the recording's authenticity to The Associated Press.

'Although the tape was released without Matt's knowledge or permission, it illustrates that he made the difficult decision to come forward and tell the painful truth to investigators despite extraordinary pressure to support his father,' lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin wrote in a statement.

Sandusky's defence lawyer Joe 
Amendola told NBC News that his client was devastated by the claims of 
his son, whom he and his wife Dottie adopted at age 18 after meeting him
when he was a child through The Second Mile, that charity that Sandusky
founded in 1977.

Mr Amendola told the network: 'When Jerry heard that initially, he was very upset. That was the most despondent I’d seen him.'

He added: 'He’s not a beaten man. He 
is pacing a cell right now being held in solitary confinement... At this
point, he maintains his innocence adamantly.'

Prosecutors were eying Matt Sandusky as a possible rebuttal witness if Jerry Sandusky took the stand in his own defence.

Both sides rested their cases last week without calling either of the men to testify.

Yesterday, it was revealed that Matt 
Sandusky told police he had been sexually abused by the convicted 
pedophile, but was worried he would be charged with perjury for not 
admitting the attacks under oath to a grand jury.

Karl Rominger, part of Jerry Sandusky's defense team, told ABC: 'As a general rule it's a tape of Matt (Sandusky) making the allegations.

'I don't feel comfortable going into specifics about what he says, but I'll say that he is an alleged victim, so that will tell you some.'

The young man hesitated to reveal the horrific abuse he was also allegedly a victim of because he had previously said under oath that no abuse had taken place.

His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine 
Andronici, issued a statement on last Thursday that named Matt Sandusky and 
saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of 
prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial.

The case rocked the Penn State community following the defense coordinator's arrest in November.

The ensuing scandal led to the firing of Sandusky's former boss - Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno - and the university's president, while forcing a re-examination of the role that college administrators played in reporting abuse allegations.

A juror who voted to convict the retired Penn State assistant coach said she hoped the verdict would help his accusers heal.

Jurors weighed the accounts and evidence diligently before finding Sandusky guilty last week of 45 counts for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years, she said.

Sandusky, 68, is under observation at
the Centre County jail, where he is being kept away from other inmates 
pending a psychological review that will help determine the next step 
toward his sentencing in about three months.

Judge John Cleland ordered county probation officers to evaluate whether Sandusky is a sexual predator, a finding that could factor into his prison placement.

Sex offenders are required to undergo treatment while in prison, so if deemed a predator,  Sandusky would likely be sent to a facility with such a program.

Sandusky, who has been placed under a suicide watch, said he doesn't want to kill himself and wants to get the separate psychological examination done so that he can receive visits from his friends and family, Rominger said.

'He's fine but he's just not been evaluated,' the lawyer said. 'He is very disappointed to be in prison. He is anxious to get out of this suicide watch.'

Rominger added that Sandusky told him: 'If I have to keep sitting in this room for another three or four days without being able to talk to anybody, I might start to need help at that point.'

The state investigation into Sandusky didn't begin until after the ex-coach was barred from a high school in 2009, when a mother complained about the former coach.

Charges were filed against him in November 2011.

Sandusky has repeatedly maintained his innocence. He will likely die in prison, given mandatory minimum sentencing requirements.

The conviction is just the start of possibly years of legal proceedings over the case. Besides appeals, there remains an active investigation into Sandusky by the state attorney general's office, as well as a federal investigation.

The university could also face a wave of new lawsuits.

An hour after the verdict Friday night, Penn State said in a statement it was inviting victims to 'participate in a program to facilitate the resolution of claims against the university arising out of Mr Sandusky's conduct'.

The school said it sought to address victims' concerns privately, expeditiously and fairly.

Asked to clarify, school spokesman Dave LaTorre said the university won't discuss details about litigation or how much money might be set aside for potential settlements, and declined to comment further.
