Jodie Williams claimed a brilliant silver in the 200m as her England team-mate and name-sake Bianca Williams came home in third to win bronze.

Williams, a prodigious junior, landed her maiden senior major championship medal, finishing very strongly down the home straight to clock 22.50s and go second on the British all-time list.

Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare, the 100m champion, completed the double by winning in 22.25, but she was followed home by three Englishwomen.

Shock: Jodie Williams looks up in disbelief as she realises she has won a Commonwealth silver medal

England's roses: Jodie Williams (left) and Bianca Williams (right) cross the line second and third respectively

Which, even in the absence of the top Jamaicans, could mark a watershed moment for women's sprinting in this country.

Williams, 20, who enjoyed a 151-race unbeaten streak over five years from 2005 but was cruelly ruled out of London 2012 with a hamstring injury, held off her namesake Bianca, who took the bronze in 22.58, also a personal best.

Anyika Onuora was fourth in 22.64, another PB.
