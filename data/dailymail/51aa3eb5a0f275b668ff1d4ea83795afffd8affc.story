Referee Michaela Tabb has decided to leave the World Snooker circuit.

Tabb, 47, was the first woman to referee at a world ranking tournament and led the way too as the first to do so in a final.

The Scot has twice taken charge of the World Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre, another first in 2009 and then again in 2012.

Tabb was the first female to referee a World Championship final at the Crucible in 2009

She had previously played on the eight-ball pool circuit, and also captained the Scottish ladies' pool team.

It was announced on Thursday, however, that she has left the circuit.

A World Snooker statement read: 'Michaela Tabb, one of snooker's most experienced referees who took charge of two World Championship finals, has left the World Snooker circuit.

'Michaela's involvement in snooker began in 2001 when she was fast tracked by World Snooker having worked as a pool referee.

'She refereed her first snooker match at the Crucible Theatre in 2003, and in 2009 became the first woman ever to referee the World Championship Final.

'World Snooker would like to take the opportunity to thank Michaela for her contribution to World Snooker over the last 14 years and wish her all the best with her future refereeing endeavours.'
