Andrew Flintoff compared his cricketing comeback to sex as he made his return to professional cricket by taking two wickets in Lancashire's win over Worcestershire in his first county game since 2009.

Flintoff, listed to bat at number eight, was not required as Lancashire posted 229-4 in their 20 overs in the NatWest Twenty20 Blast clash at New Road to move top of the North Division.

The former England all-rounder sensationally announced his comeback in May for Lancashire's T20 campaign, almost five years after hanging up his boots following England's 2009 Ashes triumph at the Oval.

‘It’s a bit like sex — always better second time!’ tweeted 36-year-old after the game.

Flintoff's two victims in his first competitive game for almost half a decade were the unfortunate Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Alexei Kervezee.

Elsewhere in the Lancashire side, Ashwell Prince top-scored with 68, while the main aggressors were Jos Buttler, with 55 off 28 balls, and Steven Croft with 29 from 11.

Croft removed Pears openers Daryl Mitchell (46) and Richard Oliver (44) after a 90-run stand. From then on, it was simple for Lancashire, as Kabir Ali bowled Colin Munro for 28, and Worcestershire reached 179 for 7.

Flintoff made a couple of appearances for the second XI since returning but had not been needed by the Lightning, who top the North Division, until now.
