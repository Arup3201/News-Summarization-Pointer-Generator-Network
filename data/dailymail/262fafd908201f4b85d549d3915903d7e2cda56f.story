Boxing greats including Muhammad Ali today paid their respects to former heavyweight champion Joe Frazier at a private funeral after he died last week following a battle with liver cancer.

Former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes and promoter Don King were among 4,000 people who attended the two-hour service at the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Civil rights advocate Reverend Jesse Jackson gave stirring remarks, asking fans to stand and 'show your love' for Frazier, 67, which prompted Ali to rise and vigorously clap for his fallen rival.

Ali held hands for assistance in and 
out of the church. Heavyweight legend Mike Tyson, real estate mogul 
Donald Trump and actor Mickey Rourke all sent videotaped messages of 
condolences.

'He meant everything,' Holmes said, according to NBC Sports. 'He was a friend. He was a good man. Not only to me, to everybody.'

King said: 'Joe Frazier meant a lot to everyone because he was the embodiment of a heavyweight.' He added: 'He wanted to be able to fight for the people and in doing - he was fighting for his people.'

Frazier, who died last Monday, 
was the first man to beat Ali - knocking him down and taking a decision 
in the so-called 'Fight of the Century' in 1971 at Madison Square Garden
 in New York City.

He would
 go on to lose two more fights to Ali, including the epic ‘Thrilla in 
Manila’ bout in 1975. Ali called it the ‘closest thing to dying that I 
know of’.

Frazier
 - who was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990 - won the 
heavyweight title in 1970 by stopping Jimmy Ellis in the fifth round of 
their fight at Madison Square Garden.

He
 defended it successfully four times before George Foreman knocked him 
down six times in the first two rounds to take the title from him in 
1973. He would never be heavyweight champion again.

Welterweight
 world champion Floyd Mayweather is donating money to cover some of the 
costs of the services, as is George Foreman - who was not be able to 
make the funeral.

Fans have been lining up to pay their
 respects at the casket of late boxing great Joe Frazier at a public 
memorial viewing in the middle of an arena in Philadelphia.

'I will always remember Joe with 
respect and admiration'

He was in a white, closed casket, as 
per his will, with his trademark black cowboy sitting atop and a white 
blanket that said, 'Heavyweight Champion of the World, Smokin' Joe 
Frazier '.

Frazier had been under home hospice 
care in his Philadelphia home after being diagnosed just weeks ago with 
the cancer that took his life.

'I will always remember Joe with 
respect and admiration,' Ali said in a statement about the death of his 
great rival. 'My sympathy goes out to his family and loved ones.'

Remembered: Boxing legend Frazier died on Monday aged 67 after a brief fight with liver cancer

The 1970s rivalries of Frazier, Ali 
and George Foreman will always be remembered as a golden age of 
heavyweight boxing. Boxing promoter Don King called Frazier a giant 
among men.

'You can't mention Ali without mentioning Joe Frazier,' said former Associated Press boxing writer Ed Schuyler Jr. 'He beat Ali, don't forget that.'

'Smokin' Joe', as he became known, 
was a small yet ferocious fighter who smothered his opponents with 
punches, including a devastating left hook he used to end many of his 
fights early.

Ali once said: 'Joe Frazier, I'll 
tell the world right now, brings out the best in me. I'm gonna tell ya, 
that's one helluva man, and God bless him. He is the greatest fighter of
 all times, next to me.'

Frazier was divorced from his wife, Florence, but is survived by 11 children.
