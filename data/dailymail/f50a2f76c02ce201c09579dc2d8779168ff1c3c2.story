Ministers hailed a ‘major milestone’ last night as official figures showed Britain’s economy has reached a record high – surpassing its peak before the recession.

David Cameron said the fact that the economy is now larger than it was before the financial crisis of 2008 was a ‘credit’ to the hard work of British workers and businesses.

The pace of economic recovery over the last year has taken experts by surprise, after the worst downturn for at least a century.

Britain's economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to June, taking the total size of the economy back to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2007

It has taken much longer for the UK economy to return to pre-crash levels than it did after recessions in the 1970s and 1990s

The International Monetary Fund, which had already admitted that it was wrong to warn that Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity measures would choke off recovery, this week forecast Britain’s economy would surge by 3.2 per cent this year, outstripping every other major economy in the world. 

Total output across the UK rose by a healthy 0.8 per cent between April and June – meaning the economy is now 0.2 per cent bigger than it was in early 2008, before the crisis.

But GDP per capita – the size of the economy divided by the population – is still 5.5 per cent below the pre-recession peak.

Ministers hailed ‘a big day for Britain’ following the deepest slump in post-war history.

Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – crashed by 7.2 per cent under Labour in 2008-09 as the financial crisis took its toll on families and businesses. 

It has taken more than six years for output to return to its pre-recession peak, bringing the longest downturn for at least 100 years to an end.

The Prime Minister said: ‘It is good news that, after all the hard work of the British people, the economy is now bigger than it was before the crash.’

Mr Osborne added: ‘Today we reach a major milestone in our long-term economic plan. But there is still a long way to go – the Great Recession was one of the deepest of any major economy and cost Britain six years.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘Today is a big day for Britain. The rescue has worked.’ He claimed the economy had been brought ‘back from the brink’ because of the actions of the Coalition. 

Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the news, but insisted there is still much more work to be done

After repeatedly issuing doom-laden warnings about the dangers of Mr Osborne’s plans, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls conceded: ‘At long last our economy is back to the size it was before the global banking crisis – three years after the US reached the same point.’

But he added: ‘Wages after inflation are down over £1,600 a year since 2010, housebuilding under this government is at its lowest level since the 1920s and business investment is lagging behind our competitors.’

The recovery has raised the prospect that interest rates – which have been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – will rise before the end of the year.

...as RBS profits surge to £2.7billion 

More than £2billion was added to the value of Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday after it said the economic recovery had driven a dramatic surge in profits.

The state-backed lender was forced to rush out a statement to the stock market a week early because its performance so far this year has been much better than expected. 

Profits almost doubled to £2.7billion in the first half of the year, compared with the same period last year.

This is its biggest half-year profit since it received a £46billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008. The jump in profits drove shares up 35.40p to 364.20p. 

But this is still some way short of the 500p ‘break even’ price paid for the shares during the bailout.

Chief executive Ross McEwan appeared to caution against an early sale of the Government’s 82 per cent stake in the bank, saying that RBS was facing ‘significant conduct and litigation issues that will hit our profits’.
