The Queen has called in a dog expert to sort out her corgis after they attacked Princess Beatrice’s pet terrier.

They savaged 11-year-old Max so badly he nearly lost an ear and suffered bloody bite marks that had to be treated by a vet.

Now the Queen has turned to TV animal behaviourist Dr Roger Mugford who once saved one of Princess Anne's bull terriers from being put down after it attacked two children.

She wants the 'dog whisperer,' a regular on TV's Britain's Worst Pet, to calm her cherished corgis down.

The Queen is reported to be 'very upset ' by the attack earlier this month as a  member of her Balmoral staff walked corgis, Monty, Willow and Holly and her three dorgis – corgis crossed with dachshunds – Cider, Candy and Vulcan.

Max has been a treasured companion of 24-year-old, since she got it for Christmas when she was 13. When he disappeared in 2008 from the 
family home in Windsor Great Park, the Queen led a search party which 
included the Duchess of York and Princess Eugenie.

Three weeks later he was found bedraggled and hungry. 'It's ironic that the Queen was very worried 
about Max and helped in the search for him, but now her own dogs have 
attacked him,'  said a royal source.

Dr Mugford believes he has an 'inkling' why the corgis ganged up on the Norfolk Terrier.

He said: 'There is a pack mentality 
that a group of dogs can develop which means that they regard any 
newcomer as a threat that has to be addressed.'

Dr Mugford helped out when one of Princess Anne’s bull terriers attacked a corgi so savagely the dog was later put down.

He
also testified when she was convicted under the Dangerous Dog Act in 
2002 after another of her bull terriers, Dotty, attacked two children 
and he saved the pet from a lethal injection.

Stan Rawlinson, Britain’s leading expert in canine aggression, believes the cause of the corgis' problem could be a lack of early socialisation with other dogs when they were puppies.

He told the Daily Express: 'If you socialise these dogs with other dogs and people they will become well-rounded dogs and you might not get the problem the Queen has.'

At the weekend, the Queen walked her pets and even played with a golden Labrador which came bounding up to her. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
