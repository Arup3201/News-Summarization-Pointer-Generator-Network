Drunk revellers caught urinating in the street will be handed a mop and bucket to clean it up themselves.

Police in Brighton are trying the new tactic after becoming fed up with worse for wear partygoers relieving themselves in public.

They will be given the chance to avoid an £80 fixed penalty fine if they agree to mop up themselves.

The ploy has proved to be a success after being trialled in other notorious nightspots around the country such as Newcastle and Torquay.

Officers from Sussex Police are borrowing cleaning equipment from nearby venues in order to dish out the punishment.

In a recent case, a second year University of Brighton student was forced to mop up in The Lanes area after he was caught urinating in the street last Friday.

Jennifer McGee, a second year journalism student at the University of Brighton, praised the new police approach.

She said: 'I think that it's good that the police made him clean it up.

'It's gross seeing it on the ground when you're on a night out. I'm always worried about standing in it and ruining my shoes.'

Local street pastor Ian Chisnall said: 'It is a good idea to get people taking responsibility for their actions.

'I have occasionally seen people urinating in the street. It is terrible and so smelly. Anything that encourages people from doing it again is a good thing.'

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'Anyone caught urinating in public could be liable to an £80 fixed penalty notice or even arrest depending on the circumstances, but if they offer or agree to clean up then we would encourage them to do so and offer some stern words of advice.'
