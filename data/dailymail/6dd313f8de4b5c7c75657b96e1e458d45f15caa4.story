A 28-year-old Italian tourist was killed when he was crushed by a large piece of ice that broke from a glacier, Alaska state troopers say.

Troopers say Alexander Hellweger died on Sunday shortly after 5pm at the head of Lake George Glacier, north of Anchorage.

Hellweger, from Bruneck, Italy, was on a week-long vacation in Alaska with seven friends from Italy and Belgium.

Alexander Hellweger, pictured above two days ago, from Bruneck, Italy, was on a trip with friends when a large piece of ice from a glacier fell and crushed him

The body of the 28-year-old, pictured above last year, was not immediately retrieved because of diminishing light and the danger of more ice breaking

Hellweger (third from the right), pictured last week, was on a week-long vacation in Alaska with seven friends from Belgium and Italy 

Guides had transported seven members of the party by helicopter to the backcountry to do heliskiing, or off-trail skiing and snowboarding accessed by helicopter as opposed to ski lift. 

The party was later transported to the glacier site.

While the group was viewing the glacier up close, a piece of ice calved off the glacier and crushed Hellweger, according to Alaska Dispatch News. 

The eight friends were visiting the head of Lake George Glacier, north of Anchorage, when Hellweger was crushed

A friend of Hellweger's, Johan Maesen, wrote on Facebook that the group went to Alaska as eight 'enthusiastic young people for an unforgettable adventure', but they will only return as a group of seven

Johan Maesen,  a friend of Hellweger's from Belgium who was on the trip, expressed his sadness on Facebook on Monday.

'We came up with 8 enthusiastic young people for an unforgettable adventure, we return not back with 7 people,' he wrote.

Hellweger's body was not retrieved because of diminishing light and the danger of more ice breaking off. Troopers say they have made arrangements to recover the body later.

Hellweger's family has been notified and arrangements.
