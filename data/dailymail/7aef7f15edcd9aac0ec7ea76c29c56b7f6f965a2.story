Harry Redknapp believes QPR striker Charlie Austin will find the consistency needed to avoid becoming a one-season wonder.

Austin, a £4million signing from Burnley in 2013, is the highest-scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League this season with 11 goals in 15 appearances and will be the Hoops' main threat in the Boxing Day showdown at Arsenal.

Redknapp is delighted with the 25-year-old's immediate acclimatisation to the top flight and is confident he will not fade.

'I think he will show the consistency he needs. He's mobile, he runs, he's a handful and is improving all the time. He's scored some great goals in training too,' Redknapp said.

'You can see the confidence in him now. For sure I see him doing it for more than one season.

'He's a smashing lad. If you had a club full of Charlie Austins, it would be an easy job as manager. He gets on with it and there are no problems.

'It's just the way he is, he's just a good lad. There's no one you'd want to be successful more than Charlie, he's a good person.'

Redknapp believes England selection is a possibility for Austin, but insists the former Swindon hitman is a entering a key period as he seeks recognition by Roy Hodgson.

'There are three months until the next England game and he's got to keep doing it for the next three months,' Redknapp said.

'Three months is a long time in football. If he can keep performing in these three months anything can happen for him. But that's a long way off.'
