Bernard Gavrin, from Brooklyn, New York, who will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia this month, 70 years after he went missing during the Second World War  

An American soldier will finally be buried with full military honours, 70 years after he went missing in action during the Second World War. 

The Department of Defense has confirmed that Army Private Bernard Gavrin from Brooklyn, New York, will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery after his remains were discovered only last year.

According to the Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, Private Gavrin was just 29 when he was reported missing on July 7, 1944.

His regiment has been in Saipan, Japan, in the Northern Mariana Islands of the western Pacific Ocean and came under heavy attack, suffering many casualties.

Mr Gavrin was declared dead in July 1945 and by 1948, his remains were deemed non-recoverable.

However, in recent years, excavations in Saipan by a Japanese non-profit group have turned up the remains of several American and Japanese soldiers from the Second World War.

Last year the remains and personal items from American soldiers were uncovered and were handed over to the American government for testing.

It then emerged that the remains of Mr Gavrin were among them after they were tested using a family member's DNA.

Mr Gavrin's 82-year-old nephew David Rogers, of Delray Beach, Florida, said he was planning to be at the burial in the cemetery on September 12.

He said it was 'absolutely incredible and unbelievable to all of us' that Gavrin would be laid to rest in 'the most honorable place you could be buried in this country.'

Mr Rogers, whose mother was Gavrin's sister, said the private was the youngest of three children and had enlisted in 1940.

He said the last time he saw his uncle was when he was eight-years-old and his uncle came to visit.

Mr Rogers had injured himself, requiring stitches, and Mr Gavrin went to his bedroom.

'He awakened me and kissed me on the forehead,' Rogers said.

He also recalled how the loss of his uncle was shattering and said that when the telegram came to inform the family he was missing, that his grandmother, Mr Gavrin's mother, opened it.

He added: 'She let out a scream that lives with me to this day.'
