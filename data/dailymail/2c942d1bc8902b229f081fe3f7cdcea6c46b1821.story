A teenager who was shocked to discover she had breast cancer when she was just 15-years old is now educating other young women about the disease.

Morgan Watson, from Herriman, Utah, was diagnosed with medullary carcinoma in August 2010 and spent the next year going through aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Now in remission she told KSL.com: ‘I'm just glad to be a part of it and spread information about the disease… and have them be aware that it can happen to them.

Morgan Watson, who became a breast cancer sufferer at the age of just 15, is now helping other young teens to learn more about the illness

The exceptional teenager excelled at softball and is an aspiring thespian who enjoys drama and acting, but was then struck down by cancer before she could even get a driver's license

‘Mine was an exceptionally rare case, but the more knowledge that you have the more you can prepare for things to happen in the future.’

Medullary carcinoma is a rare type of mutation to the more common breast cancer, accounting for approximately three to five percent of all cases. It usually affects women in their late 40s and early 50s.

After consulting four different doctors, Miss Watson found 'a really great team of women' physicians at the Huntsman Cancer Institute who developed a suitable treatment plan.

'I was in very good hands from the very beginning and couldn’t have asked for anything better,' she said.

Morgan was incredibly unlucky to be diagnosed with the form of cancer, with teenagers standing just a 1 in 20,000 chance of getting it

Yesterday the 17-year-old visited students at Jordan High School in Utah, who were encouraged to wear pink to school instead of Halloween costumes for the occasion.

She urged the crowd that gathered to recognize that breast cancer doesn't just affect older women, highlighting the importance of a healthy lifestyle in warding off disease.

‘High school students tend to think more about their social lives - being the most important thing - but they don't really get involved with causes or things like that,' she explained.

Recalling how she felt when she first received her diagnosis more than two years ago, the Utah State University student said: ‘I was terrified for my life.

‘I didn’t know if I was going to be alive for my next birthday. Every day was treasured as if it was my last.’

When her hair fell out she proudly went to school sporting her bald head, stating that 'I wanted to embrace it and not let it ruin who I was as a person'.

Women have a 1 in 28 chance of contracting breast cancer between the ages of 60 and 70.

But as a teenager the risk is less than 1 in 20,000.
