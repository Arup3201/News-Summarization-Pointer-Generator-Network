A new hearing aid that's  attached to the head by  magnets has been 
life-transforming for drama  teacher and mother-of-four Emma Stothers, 
37, from St Andrews in Fife. Here, she  talks to CAROL DAVIS about the 
experience...

When I was seven, I was diagnosed 
with glue ear in both ears - my ears were filled with fluid, which was 
stopping me from hearing properly.

I had an operation to insert 
grommets - little plastic tubes - to drain  the fluid. They did help, 
though my hearing was still poor and I needed extra lessons because it 
affected my school work.

And the grommets kept falling out - I had three operations over four years to put them back.

As I grew up, going out with friends was difficult. I had to ask people to repeat themselves and noisy places were a nightmare.

Over
 time, I learned to lip-read. But as a drama teacher, it wasn't easy 
because the children don't always speak clearly or look at you when 
they're speaking.

By 30, I was still struggling. My husband, John, 
helped by speaking loudly and repeating things, but we have four boys, 
so the house could be incredibly noisy, with me straining to hear and 
turning the TV up, and the children shouting to make themselves heard.

It seemed to be getting worse - sometimes, I wouldn't hear the phone or doorbell.

Once, my three-year-old dialled 999 and I didn't hear the police call back, so they turned up on the doorstep.

I worried my hearing would go completely, or my children would need me and I wouldn't hear.

In
 2007, I saw my GP, who referred me to consultant ear, nose and throat 
surgeon Stephen Jones - he referred me for a hearing aid in my left ear,
 which was worse than the right. Although that helped, I kept getting 
ear infections: Mr Jones said the hearing aid made my ear damp and 
humid, encouraging bacteria.

I kept needing antibiotics and ear drops, so only used the hearing aid while teaching - this did help to reduce the infections.

When
 I next saw Mr Jones, he said that, in fact, it wasn't the glue ear 
causing the hearing problems for all those years; I had otosclerosis.

There
 are three tiny bones in the middle ear, just behind the ear drum, which
 transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear. Otosclerosis is when extra 
bone grows around the smallest bone, which means it can't move and pass 
on sound vibrations.

Mr Jones said it can be linked to raised 
oestrogen levels, and could have become worse during pregnancy. He tried
 to free the bone surgically, but scar tissue meant he could not 
proceed.

Mr Jones said I could have a bone-anchored hearing aid - 
this would transmit the sound vibrations through the bone of my skull to
 the inner ear, instead of via the ear canal. The hearing aid would be 
fixed by a screw into my skull.

But I wasn't keen, because I'd read they caused infections - and didn't fancy a screw sticking out of my skin.

In
 2012, Mr Jones mentioned a new hearing aid implant -  the part of the 
device that transmitted the sound vibrations to my inner ear would be 
surgically implanted into the bone behind my ear.

The external sound
 processor and microphone, about the thickness of a £2 coin, would be 
held in place behind my ear by a magnet, which would be attracted to the
 magnetic end of the implant, so I could remove it to sleep or shower. 
There was less risk of infection, and I could have it done on the NHS.

I
 had the hour-long operation in January 2013. Afterwards, the skin 
behind my ear was sore and swollen, so I needed painkillers. The 
swelling settled down after four weeks.

Five weeks after surgery, an 
audiologist put the sound processor above my left ear. Suddenly, I heard
 doors closing, phones ringing and footsteps - things I'd barely heard 
before. Coming home to four lively boys was amazing. I could hear the 
tiniest sounds - and correct their pronunciation while  they were 
learning to speak.  It's fantastic.

Stephen Jones is consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.

ten
 million Britons suffer from hearing loss. In many cases it is 
age-related, but it can also be caused by wax, glue ear, head injury, 
acute ear infections, or conditions such as otosclerosis, thought to 
affect 2 per cent  of people.

When we hear, soundwaves move through 
the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are passed 
via three tiny, linked bones in the middle ear to the inner ear, where 
they are converted to nerve impulses which are carried to the brain.

With otosclerosis, the smallest of the three bones, shaped like a stirrup, becomes fixed and cannot vibrate.

As
 a result, patients often can't hear anything under 60 decibels, such as
 normal conversation. Normal hearing detects sounds from under 20 
decibels.

Hearing aids help, but can lead to ear infections.

With
 otosclerosis, we can remove part of the fixed bone and replace it with 
an artificial link so that it moves again.  This is usually successful 
but,  in Emma's case, scar tissue prevented us from doing this.

Another option for hearing loss caused by a blockage or an abnormality in the ear is a bone-anchored hearing aid.

Normally,
 sound is transmitted through the middle ear to the inner ear - but it 
can also be transmitted through bone. With a bone-anchored hearing aid, 
an external sound processor is fixed onto a titanium screw implanted 
into the bone behind the ear.

These work in the vast majority of 
cases, though a few get infections that can mean skin grows over the 
head of the screw so the sound processor can't stay in place. Some 
people find the screw unattractive, and don't like being able to feel 
it.

The new Bonebridge device is attached with a magnet instead - an 
external sound processor transmits sound to a 4-5cm to 5cm implant under
 the skin, which vibrates and sends the sound to the inner ear.

This 
could help people who cannot wear hearing aids, usually because of ear 
infections, or people born without an ear canal - but it won't help 
people with severe hearing loss because their level of hearing loss is  
too extreme.

The operation carries standard risks of bleeding and 
infection and a small risk of puncturing the dura (the thick membrane 
surrounding the brain), which could cause a leak of cerebrospinal fluid.
 This would need to be repaired, as it could  cause meningitis.

Depending
 on whether there is enough space in the mastoid bone, behind the ear, 
to embed the implant, or whether we have to find a different site behind
 a vein behind the ear, The operation takes 45 to 90 minutes under 
general anaesthetic.

I make a 5cm incision and peel back the skin 
and muscle to expose the bone. I then drill a well in the bone for the 
implant and screw it in place. The incision is stitched.

Once the 
incision has healed, at least three weeks later, the patient sees an 
audiologist to put the sound processor in place and switch it on.

The
 implant stays in place indefinitely; the patient changes the batteries 
in the external sound processor when needed. After around seven years,  
the processor will probably  need replacing, as tiny parts wear out and 
newer models  are developed.

Patients should have many years of good hearing.

ANY DRAWBACKS?

'This
 operation carries a small risk of bleeding and infection or of the 
implant failing so it needs to be taken out,' says Kevin Green, 
consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

'Drilling into the mastoid bone carries a theoretical risk of damage to the membrane covering the brain.

'We
 don't know how Bonebridge will perform long term, but we expect it to 
last for years. For the right patient, it works well and can restore 
hearing after years of hearing loss.'

The operation costs £12,000 to £15,000 privately and is a similar cost to the NHS.
