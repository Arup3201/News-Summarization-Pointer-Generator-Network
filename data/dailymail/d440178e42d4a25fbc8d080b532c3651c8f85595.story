A Michigan sheriff has taken a swipe at crime dramas such as Netflix smash Orange Is The New Black for making prison uniforms 'cool' and 'trendy', announcing that he has completely overhauled the jumpsuits at his jail as a result.

Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel believes that standard all-orange jumpsuits have increasingly become seen as fashionable because of pop culture, so he has reverted the inmates at Saginaw County Jail to wearing convict era-style black and white stripes.

'When the lines get blurred between the culture outside the jail and the culture within the jail, I have to do something to redefine those boundaries, because they've been blurred far too often in public culture,' Federspiel told Signaw County News.

New look: Siginaw County Jail in Michigan - which houses 513 inmates - is introducing new black-and-white-striped uniforms because shows such as Orange Is The New Black made orange - the standard prison uniform color - 'fashionable'

Inspiring change: The popularity of Orange Is The New Black starring Taylor Schilling (pictured) has been blamed for 'blurring the lines between the culture outside jail and the culture inside jail'

Fashion crisis: The Siginaw County Jail, which houses 513 inmates, is changing its uniforms from orange to black-and-white-stripes because shows like Orange Is The New Black have made orange trendy

'It's because as you see shows on 
television, like Orange Is The New Black, some people think it's cool to
 look like an inmate of the Saginaw County Jail with wearing all orange 
jumpsuits out at the mall or in public.

'We decided that the black-and-white stripes would be the best way to go because it signifies 'jail inmate,' and I don't see people out there wanting to wear black-and-white stripes.'

Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel wants the uniforms to signify 'jail' and not 'cool'

Federspiel believes that the Netflix series starring Taylor Schilling - which was recently nominated for four Emmy Awards - is so in vogue that regular people are wearing orange jumpsuits out in public.

He says inmates sometimes do community work, and he doesn't want there to be any confusion.

The jailhouse fashions come relatively cheap.

The sheriff says the new monochrome jumpsuits, which last for about two to three years, cost $11.73 apiece.

Siginaw County Jail houses about 513 inmates on a daily basis.

Siginaw is the third most violent city per capita in the United States, according to 2012 crime statistics compiled by the FBI.

The city was places  behind Flint and Camden, N.J. for the number of violent crimes recorded per capita in cities of 50,000 people or more.

It is located about 100 miles north-west of Detroit.

Federspiel hopes all prisoners will be in their new uniform by the end of the year. But the inmates are not happy about the change.

'They don't like it,' Federspiel told The Siginaw County News.

'They've been very verbal. A lot of them have said, ''We don't like wearing black-and-white stripes''.

And my response is, ''Too bad. Don't come to jail''.

'If you come to dinner at my house and you don't like what I'm serving, don't come back ... I didn't ask you to come wear this uniform.

'It tells me something, though, when the inmates think that it's bad: It's probably good. '

'We don't want them getting too comfortable, feeling like they're productive members of society, when actually they're incarcerated.'

Orange Is The New Black, from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan, was turned down by almost all major American TV networks before Netflix picked it up.

Using an experimental format of releasing the entire first season all at once, it unexpectedly went on to become one of the biggest shows of 2013, only increasing its audience with the debut of its second season in June.

The third season is currently being filmed and is slated for a summer 2015 release.

Orange Is The New Black - starring Laura Prepon (left) and Taylor Schilling (right) - was recently nominated for four Emmy Awards

Orange is the New Black received a total of four Emmy Award nominations for 2014, including star Taylor Schilling('Piper Chapman'), who is up for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy.

It is also nominated for Outstanding Comedy and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy (Kate Mulgrew ('Red').

Three of the supporting stars are up for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy, including Natasha Lyonne ('Nicky'), Uzo Aduba ('Crazy Eyes') and Laverne Cox ('Sophia').
