Trapped and tightly bound, this sea lion is pinned to the spot after becoming caught in a windsock.

The shocking picture comes from a video revealing the devastating effects man’s rubbish is having on wildlife.

In the footage, seals and sea lions are seen with fishing lures hanging from their mouths or their necks bound by rubber bands and the plastic packing bands usually used to secure boxes.

In a second image, the swelling and damage caused by one of these bands around a sea lion’s neck is painfully visible.

It is thought that many of the 
animals become ensnared in the bands when  they are young. As they grow,
the plastic gradually cuts into their bodies, slowly strangling them.

The Alaska Department of Fish and 
Game released the video to highlight the effect discarded fishing gear 
and other debris is having on marine animals.

It follows the Daily Mail’s 
long-running Banish the Bags campaign, which aims to eradicate western 
dependence on plastic bags that has led to the deaths of whales off 
Britain’s coastline.

Authorities in Alaska believe they 
have underestimated the number of animals injured in this way, and they 
are now looking to work more closely with the fishing industry to 
prevent sea lions and seals becoming trapped in debris. Shoppers are 
also being urged to cut up plastic loops or rings from packaging before 
they throw them into the bin.

A study of eastern Steller sea lions,
which are in danger of extinction, was carried out between 2000 and 
2007 along the coast of Alaska and northern British Columbia.

Researchers found that at least 386 animals had become entangled in or had swallowed debris.

Plastic packing bands and  rubber bands were the most  common items found around their necks.

Metal flasher lures, which  are used when fishing for salmon, were the most likely to be ingested.

But the researchers said they could 
have missed out some animals because they didn’t come to the shore or 
were not visible among large  crowds of sea lions.

Wildlife biologist Lauri Jemison 
said: ‘We are certainly underestimating the number of animals entangled.
We go out every summer here in southeastern Alaska and we try to visit 
every haul out [where animals come to shore] and rookery [where they 
breed] at least once.’

Sea debris can also be 
life-threatening for other marine wildlife, including sea birds and 
turtles. As well as the Steller sea lions, northern fur seals are also 
badly affected.

Although the researchers found that 
they don’t swallow as much fishing gear as the Steller sea lions, they 
are likely to get the plastic bands trapped around their necks.

The Alaska Department of Fish and 
Game is now looking for funding to work with the fishing industry to 
help prevent sea lions and seals from becoming trapped in fishing 
equipment.

Sadly, any positive action has come too late for the sea lion trapped in the windsock. It did not survive its ordeal.
