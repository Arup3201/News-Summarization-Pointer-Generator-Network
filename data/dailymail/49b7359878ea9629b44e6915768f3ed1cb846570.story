Police warned families on a residential street that it was a crime for their children to skateboard on the road, it emerged last night.

Surrey Police officers have apologised for posting the notices through doors on a road in Thames Ditton, which left children as young as six scared that they would be arrested for playing outside.

Detectives said in the letter that they were 'reminding parents and youths of their legal and social responsibilities', adding that 'playing football or other sports in the street is a criminal offence'.

Local resident Catriona Riddell said some children on the street - which has an average house price of £770,000 - had started to go outside to play after the road was resurfaced last month.

The 46-year-old mother-of-two told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Then all of a sudden parents started coming out and having a chat. It was a really lovely atmosphere - there was that sense of freedom.

‘When we received the leaflet, I think there was just sheer disappointment. It was a completely disproportionate reaction to a bunch of kids out playing.’

Mrs Riddell added that her children - Eilidh, ten, and Kirsty, eight - had not been watching TV since the road was resurfaced, and she had even started to meet neighbours from surrounding streets.

She said most of the children had been playing ball games rather than skating - and added that up to 15 had been out either on Sunday afternoons or after school until around 6pm.

Other parents wrote on the community Facebook page, About Thames Ditton, after the flyer was posted on September 27.

Harrison said: ‘I have three children who have been playing in 
Southville Road... yep, guilty as charged... they have been playing on 
scooters and skateboards, making new friends and having fun.

‘I can assure you their safety is 
paramount. I actually had to tell my kids this week that the police and 
certain residents of our community want you back indoors in front of TVs
and computers.’

Some 24 hours after the flyer went out, 
Inspector David Hollingworth apologised in another flyer for ‘any 
offence it may have caused’.

He added that although playing games on a road could be unlawful in some instances, ‘this would not in any way be criminal behaviour’, reported the Daily Telegraph.

A Surrey Police spokesman said the flyer was ‘worded incorrectly’ and that police later organised a road safety workshop for children on the street.

Thames Ditton is 16 miles south-west of Westminster and has an average house price of £590,000.
