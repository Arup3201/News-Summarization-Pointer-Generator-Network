It is a statistic that haunts Everton fans – the last time their club beat Liverpool at Anfield was 1999.

A lot has changed since that fiery Monday night fifteen years ago when Everton escaped from their rival's home with a 1-0 win and only 19 players finished the match.

Everton's Francis Jeffers and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld were sent off for fighting in the second half.

A 19-year-old Steven Gerrard then came from the bench to be shown a red card in stoppage time for a waist-high challenge on goalscorer Kevin Campbell, who netted what turned out to be the winner in only the fourth minute.

Michael Owen, also 19, was lucky not to be dismissed for a similarly ugly challenge in a ferocious Merseyside derby.

But what became of the players who featured that night? Sportsmail takes a look at where they are now...

LIVERPOOL

Sander Westerveld, 39

Dietmar Hamann, 41

Hamann is a regular on TV screens since he retired three years ago. He has appeared as a pundit on Match of the Day, Sky Sports and is a regular part of the team on Irish TV channel RTE.

Robbie Fowler, 39

One of the most natural goalscorers to be born in England, Fowler is attempting to pass that on to Liverpool youngsters coaching at their academy. He applied for the vacant Leeds manager job earlier this month but was unsuccessful.

Steven Gerrard, 34 (came on for Hamann)

Fifteen years later from that game, he is still going strong. The 34-year-old is the heart and soul of the Liverpool team, and was, too, for England before he retired in the summer.

Titi Camara, 41 (came on for Smicer)

Now in charge of the Guinea national football team, a job he has had since 2009. Camara was captain of the African side and won 38 caps for them.
