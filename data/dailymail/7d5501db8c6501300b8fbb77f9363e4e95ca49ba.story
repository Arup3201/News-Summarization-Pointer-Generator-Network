Thousands of holidaymakers are returning from the Caribbean with the same debilitating and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus that actress Lindsay Lohan contracted this winter,

An unprecedented outbreak of the Chikungunya virus continues to affect islands including Barbados, St Lucia and the Grenadines, where many travelers flock during the cold season.

The disease, which causes severe, often disabling joint pain, leaves its victims bedridden for days. Some have reported feeling its effects for years, while its more vulnerable victims have died. 

Although trials of an anti-viral drug  have had positive results,  there is currently no vaccine for the bug commercially available. And worryingly, few US doctors are prepared to recognize its signs.

Last month, Lohan was hospitalized at King Edward VII's Hospital in London after contracting the virus while on a break in French Polynesia over the Christmas holiday, TMZ reported at the time. 

Despite her illness, the 28-year-old Mean Girls star has since been seen out and about. On Thursday, she was pictured jetting of Los Angeles, California, following a brief filming and promotional visit.

At the time she fell ill with the virus, Lohan took to Instagram and Twitter to express her determination to not let the bug ruin her holiday, saying: 'I refuse to let a virus effect my peaceful vacation (sic).'

The actress, who also starred in The Parent Trap, later posted a snap of herself jet skiing in a bikini, with the caption: 'Before I got Chikungunya. Use big spray please. God bless'.

Since it spread from Asia and Africa in late 2013, Chikungunya has infected a million people in the Caribbean, Latin America and parts of South America and Mexico.

In the U.S. alone, more than 2,300 travelers since last May have brought home the virus, which has nothing to do with chickens. About a dozen people have gotten it from mosquito bites in Florida.

The virus can cause fever, a rash, headache and joint pain (mostly in the arms and legs) that can lasts for years.  Symptoms typically start three to seven days after the mosquito bite.

Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include a fever, headaches, rashes and joint pain.

After being bitten the onset of illness occurs usually between four and eight days, but can range from two to 12.

There is no vaccine or cure and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

Most patients recover fully but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years. 

Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.

The disease was first described during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Since then, it has spread to nearly 40 countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe.

At one New York hospital, a woman arrived in such agony she had to be admitted just to control her pain. 'Thinks she has chicken virus??'  staff wrote on the medical chart after speaking to her.

Another victim, Marisa Hargrove, arrived at a Miami emergency room after suffering from joint pain so bad her husband was forced to help her to the bathroom.

A doctor ran tests for common illnesses 'and basically called me his mystery case of the day,' she said. Back home and getting sicker, Mrs Hargrove searched her symptoms on the Internet.

She then returned to the emergency room and asked: 'Is it possible it's this new chikungunya?'. 'The doctor looked at me like I was crazy and said, "What the heck is that?",' she said.

A blood test confirmed she had it, and the 42-year-old Miami woman became one of the first Americans to have caught chikungunya from local mosquitoes. 

State health officials say at least 11 people have been infected in Florida, and they worry the virus will become established there. Amd Florida is not the only state at risk

The mosquitoes that spread chikungunya live throughout the South, West and Eastern seaboard of the U.S. Local mosquitoes that bite a traveler infected with the virus can pass it by biting others.

'We're very concerned' about travelers because Tennessee has the mosquitoes and climate to let the disease take hold, Abelardo Moncayo of that state's Department of Health told an audience at an American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference in New Orleans in November.

'Anywhere that's warm and humid and can sustain mosquitoes year round. So Florida, Texas, any of those Southern states, it could happen,' added Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University infectious disease expert and an editor of a scientific journal on mosquito-spread diseases.

Outbreaks spread by locally infected mosquitoes have occurred in Italy and France, and one type of mosquito that can carry chikungunya recently was found in the United Kingdom.

'You can't be reinfected, at least as far as we know,' but there is no vaccine, Higgs said.

There also is little treatment besides medicine for pain.

'It can be very bad and can last for a long time, sometimes even for years,' said Dr. Jacques Simkins, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

He treated Mrs Hargrove once her illness was finally diagnosed last July.

'The symptoms come and go,' she said. 'Even today I still get pains in my ankles, my knees, my fingers but it's very transient. You never know when it's going to happen.'

Dr. Mindy Brittner, a doctor at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, treated the 60-year-old woman who stumped the emergency room with her talk of 'chicken virus'.

'She came in with fever and terrible muscle and joint pain,'  Brittner, who presented the case at the tropical disease conference, said of the woman, who had visited the Dominican Republic.

Anyone who is traveling to the Caribbean or one of the two dozen countries where chikungunya is a risk is advised to use bug repellent with plenty of the active ingredient, such as DEET. 

They should also keep their arms and legs covered, and be alert for symptoms upon their return.
