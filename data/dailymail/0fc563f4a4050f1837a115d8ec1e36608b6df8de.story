A bungling bus driver brought holiday traffic to a standstill after trying to drive a 14ft double-decker under a 11ft railway bridge.

The mechanic who was taking the bus for a test drive has been suspended after he got it wedged in the tunnel this afternoon near Bournemouth, Dorset.

He had been trying to squeeze the out of service vehicle through after driving down a road that was off the bus' usual route.

The double decker was on a road test when it became jammed under a bridge today in Dorset

Traffic had to be diverted for more than an hour while the tyres were deflated and the bus recovered

The roof and top deck buckled under the 
pressure as he attempted to make it under the bridge.

By 
the time it came to a halt it was completely stuck.

Queues of traffic were backed up for miles and several roads had to be closed following the blunder.

It took almost two hours to free the enormous vehicle by letting air out of its tyres then dragging it out with a recovery truck.

Yellow Buses said the vehicle, whose top deck crumpled in the tunnel, was not using one of its usual routes

Owner Yellow Buses said the driver was not injured.

A spokesman said an internal investigation had been launched to establish why the bus had been driven off route.

A passing policeman who helped direct traffic away from the scene said the bus was 'properly wedged in', adding 'It's a 14ft 6ins bus trying to get through a 10ft 9ins gap.'

Onlooker Michael Smith, 72, said: 'I have lived here for 12 years and there's always someone scraping the top of the bridge but I have never seen a bus jammed underneath.

By the time the bus came to a halt it was completely stuck and the roof had buckled under the pressure

'If you look at the side of the bus you can see the roof of the top deck has gone over to the side.'

Railway engineers checked the bridge but said no serious damage had been done to it.

A spokesperson for Stagecoach said rail passengers were unaffected by the drama.
