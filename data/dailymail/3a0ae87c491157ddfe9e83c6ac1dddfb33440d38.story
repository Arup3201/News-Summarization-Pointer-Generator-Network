Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he finds the burqa confronting and wishes people didn't wear it, but that it is their right to do so in Australia because it's a free country.

But Mr Abbott has voiced support for ensuring the all-encompassing Islamic dress is not worn inside Parliament House because it is a high-security building where people's faces should not be hidden. 

At a press conference in Canberra this morning, Mr Abbott - who stopped short of calling for the garb to be banned - repeated previous remarks that he found the full body dress 'confronting'. 

His comments follow calls from a series of Liberal backbenchers and conservative Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie  for the dress to be banned from Federal Parliament. 

Mr Abbott's own chief of staff, Peta Credlin, has reportedly expressed support for the ban.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has weighed into the burqa debate. In 2010, Mr Abbott told reporters he found the Islamic dress 'confronting.

Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott's chief of staff and top adviser, supports a burqa ban in parliament house, Fairfax reports 

'Frankly, I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott said on Wednesday. 

'But we are a free country, we are a free society and it is not the business of government to tell people what they should and shouldn’t wear.'

Mr Abbott said Parliament House was currently a 'secure' building and said he did not want to make a 'mountain over a molehill'. 

'It is perfectly appropriate that in certain circumstances people be required to show their face. There can't be one rule for one form of attire and a different rule for another form of attire. It has to be the same rules for everyone, and if the rules require you to show your face, well, you show your face,' he said.

Mr Abbott said that 'to the best of our knowledge' no one had ever tried to enter Parliament House wearing a burqa. 

According to Fairfax Media, Ms Credlin expressed sympathy to the idea the burqa should be banned in comments to Liberal backbencher George Christensen last week.Mr Christensen is a vocal supporter of the ban. 

The report said Ms Credlin warned Mr Christensen against fuelling further tension in the community and urged him to instead clarify that the headdress presents security concerns when approaching the controversial debate.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the ban was a 'dreadful proposition'.'It divides our society,' Mr Shorten said.

Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has written to Parliament's presiding officers, requesting the full-body dress be banned.

Senator Bernardi previously told Sky News: 'Parliament House should be open to the people but we need to know the identity of the people who are coming in here'.

While Mr Bernardi supports a complete public ban of the religious headdress, Fairfax Media reports Ms Credlin only agrees with a ban being enforced in Parliament House because other face-covering garb, such as helmets, are already banned.

Mr Bernardi renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa due to security and identification issues earlier this month following the terror raids in Sydney.

'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust(ralia),' he tweeted to his 13,000 followers. 

Conservative Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie echoed his sentiments, telling media that she opposes the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women.

She also posted a controversial meme to her Facebook page featuring a woman wearing a burqa and holding a gun, which said 'for security reasons it's now time to ban the burqa'.  

The news comes only a week after Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa due to security and identification issues

To the government's knowledge no one has tried to enter Parliament House wearing a burqa, Mr Abbott said
