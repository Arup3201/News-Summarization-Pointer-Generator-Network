Some of the world's best-known landmarks have been painstakingly imitated - with canned food.

Volunteers in Vancouver, Canada, used 65,000 full tins of everything from tuna to tomatoes to create sculptures ranging from Florida's Space Shuttle to Dutch windmills.

But they will not stand for long - as the Canstruction event donates all the tins to the poor.

More than a million have been handed to the city's food banks since the contest began in 2002.

Blast-off! Tinned soup and burgers were used for the Space Shuttle - complete with cotton wool for smoke

Around the World in 65,000 tins: The theme for this year's event included the Eiffel tower and a Dutch windmill

Flight of fancy: Thousands of tins of food were used to create this old-fashioned plane, complete with propellers. The sculptures will be dismantled and their contents will be donated to food banks

This year's theme was Around the World and competitors were judged in categories ranging from structural integrity to best meal.

Cans are referred to as 'pixels' by the artists and are built into recognisable sculptures by carefully matching the colours to the real thing, like a digital image or an ancient mosaic.

Creators of the best sculptures were put through to a prestigious world final in New York.

All 65,000 of the cans were donated by the community and the contest attracted around 300 participants.

The first Canstruction contest was conceived in New York in 1992 by Cheri Melillo, a member of the Society of Design Administration.

Recognise this? Competitors are not limited to tins - other pre-packaged processed food is acceptable too

Since then it has spread as far as Australia and Hawaii and claimed to provide almost four million meals to hungry families last year.

George Kallas, who brought the contest to Vancouver, said: 'As a child I remember my parents taking food to the needier families in the neighborhood during the holidays, this vision really stuck with me and was one of my real motivations behind bringing the event to Vancouver.

'How perfect is it to merge design, creativity and giving to those in need?'

Some 1.23million tins of food - mostly tuna, salmon and ham - have been handed to the Greater Vancouver Foodbank by the event since 2002.
