First there were plants that tweeted when they were thirsty, then there were gadgets that helped pets tweet when they were hungry. Now there's a tweeting bra.

Created by Nestle Fitness, each time Greek celebrity Maria Bakodimus unhooks the clasp on the bespoke underwear, a tweet is automatically sent reminding women to examine their breasts.

It has been designed to promote Breast Cancer Awareness month after figures suggest women don't check their breasts often enough for lumps.

The Tweeting Bra, pictured, was created by Nestle Fitness to promote Breast Cancer Awareness month. Each time Greek celebrity Maria Bakodimus unhooks the clasp, a tweet is sent automatically to remind women to check their breasts as part of Breast Cancer Awareness month

The bra's clasp is fitted with a sensor that contains a Bluetooth transmitter. When the clasp is unhooked and the connection is broken, it sends a signal to the user's mobile device.

This then generates an automated tweet, which is sent from the Twitter account @tweetingbra. A translated version of the tweet says: 'Don't forget to check your breasts women #tweetingbra.'

October is internationally recognised as Breast Cancer Awareness month.

The National Breast Cancer organisation claims women should check their breasts for signs of cancer, including changes in colour and unusual lumps, at least once a month.

It adds 40 per cent of cancer cases start with a lump found during a self-examination and this is the first step towards diagnosing the disease through mammograms.Â

During a video explaining the concept, singer and TV presenter Bakodimus explained: 'We all have a monthly date with ourselves: The breast self-examination date.

'Some women, though, forget all about it.

'That's why Fitness has introduced a new ally in the fight against breast cancer - the Tweeting Bra.

'The first bra that can actually tweet.

'Each time I unhook it, the bra sends a tweet automatically, reminding women of their breast self-examination.

'Our mission? To deliver the life-saving message to everyone.'

The bra is not for sale and Nestle said it has no plans to make it available to consumers.
