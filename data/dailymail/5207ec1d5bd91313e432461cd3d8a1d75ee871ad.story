Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true

A friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev implicated himself and Tsarnaev in a 2011 triple slaying just before he was killed by an FBI agent early Wednesday, NBC and CBS News are reporting.

Authorities were pressuring Chechan immigrant Ibragim Todashev, 27, to make a full confession to the murders when he suddenly turned violent, according to CBS. An FBI agent responded by firing his weapon and killing Todashev.

The incident happened at Todashev's Orlando apartment, not far from Universal Studios. Initially, authorities claimed that Todashev had lunged at the agent with a knife, but they later backtracked, saying it was no longer clear whether he was armed.

Law enforcement sources tell NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network.

Authorities had gone to Todashev's home late Tuesday with evidence suggesting that Todashev, 26-year-old Tsarnaev, and Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, were involved in the 2011 killings.

No suspects had been arrested in that case, in which three men were found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks with their throats cut and marijuana covering their bodies.

Confession: Todashev had allegedly admitted to being involved in the 2011 slaying and that he was preparing to sign a written statement based on his confession when he turned violent and was subsequently shot dead earlier this week

Massachusetts investigators had reported 
earlier this month that they were uncovering 'mounting evidence' that 
Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, were involved in the 
slaying. One of the victims, Brendan Mess, was a close friend of 
Tamerlan's.

Authorities said they have no reason to believe that Todashev had any involvement in the marathon bombings.

Friends and family members of the 2011 murder victims reacted to news of the alleged confession on social media.

On a Facebook page dedicated to victim Raphael Teken, someone wrote, 'Whether we ever know exactly what happened, there is one thing we surely know and that is that Rafi deserved a much better fate.

Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to

'He was funny, kind, joyful and 
generous,' the message continued. 'All of
 us that knew him knew [his death] couldn't have been about anything he did, but 
are now horrified by what it may have been about.'

Facebook user Tony Porter wrote, 'I'm disappointed that we will never really get to experience true justice for our friend or know the reasons for what happened despite the fact that both alleged suspects are now deceased.

'I don't know how you are supposed to feel when your friend's killer gets killed, but I don't feel "relieved" like I thought I would.'

Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, confirmed to the New York Times  on Wednesday that her older son knew Todashev.

In a telephone interview from 
Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two
 years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed.

'Now another boy has left this life,' 
she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any
 trial or investigation?'

The FBI has been 
investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times
 regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by 
police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, has been charged in connection with the bombings 
and is being held at a prison medical center outside Boston.

Khusen Taramov, a friend of 
Todashev's, confirmed that Todashev and Tsarnaev knew each other. He 
said they had been in contact via phone or Skype about
 a week before the bombings.

In an interview with Orlando television station WESH, Taramov said that the two met while Todashev was living in Boston because 
they were both involved in mixed martial arts and boxing.

Todashev
 'wasn't like real close friends [with Tsarnaev], but he just happened 
to know him,' Taramov said. 'But he had no idea that they were up to 
something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I 
mean?'

Taramov says the FBI has been 
following him and Todashev since the bombings. He said that they were 
both being interviewed by agents late Tuesday before Todashev was killed.

Todashev
 was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery 
after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall.

According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space.

Todashev told police that the man 
'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got 
involved' and Todashev began fighting him.

'Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March,' the affidavit states.

A mall security officer arrived on scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes.

The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him.

The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries.
