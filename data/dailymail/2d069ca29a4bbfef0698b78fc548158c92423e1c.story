It already holds the record for the world’s fastest motorcycle but police have slammed the new Japanese street bike, saying it’s a ‘recipe for disaster’.

The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is expected to go on sale in Australia early next year for about $30,000 and will be available to anyone who holds a full motorcycle license.

But Assistant Commissioner Robert Hill has raised concerns over the supercharged engine, which offers intense acceleration of a Formula One car and is capable of hitting 100km/h in 2.5 seconds.

‘Reports of a new high powered motorbike potentially being made available for sale in Australia are very concerning,’ Mr Hill told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Motorcycle riders are identified as one of our most vulnerable road users and speed is a major factor in about one third of all fatal collisions each year.

‘To put those two factors together is a recipe for disaster on our roads.'

Mr Hill said when a motorcyclist  is involved in a collision, they are more likely to be seriously injured or killed than any other road user.

‘If you include high speed in that equation then the results are obvious. When a motorcyclist falls from a bike there are often no second chances,' he said.

So far, there have been reports of 23 motorcyclists who have died in fatal crashes on Victoria's roads in 2014.

‘Although this figure is down on last year, it is still 23 too many,' Mr Hill said.

‘Motorcycle safety is a key component in many of our road safety campaigns and will continue to be a major focus in our bid to see zero road deaths in Victoria.

‘We will continue to target the biggest killers for riders – speed and dangerous behaviour. 

'I urge all riders to slow down, travel at a safe speed and always ride with care because there’s no excuse for speeding.'

The new system offers both enhanced sport riding performance and the peace of mind to negotiate slippery surfaces with confidence

Despite the high speed, the system used on the Ninja H2 offers a selection of settings to choose from, which enables riders to control different modes to suit weather conditions.

Kawasaki says the new system offers both enhanced sport riding performance and the peace of mind to negotiate slippery surfaces with confidence.

The bike only accommodates for the rider, with a solo seat provided and brakes bigger than the Holden Commodore V8, Kawasaki has admitted the Ninja H2 is not designed for everyone.

The Kawasaki Ninja H2 has received a significant amount of interests from around the world.
