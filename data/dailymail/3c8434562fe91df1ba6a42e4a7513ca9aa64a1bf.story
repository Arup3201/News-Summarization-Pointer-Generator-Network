Bacall, Gabe, Chief, Michonne, Bindi, Bogey and Piper have been given a home - just in time for the holidays.

The brood of seven puppies were only two-days-old when they were found dumped in a trash contained outside a Radio Shack in Susanville, California.

Their eyes were still closed, their umbilical cords still attached and each weighed about one pound.

But after being found, they were taken in by the Pet Network Humane Society in Incline Village, Nevada, who worked around-the-clock to make sure they survived, The L.A. Times reported.

Dumped: These seven puppies were found in a trash container in Susanville, California, with their umbilical cords still attached, but were taken in by the Pet Network Humane Society in Incline Village, Nevada

'We're a small shelter, and we are able to do around-the-clock care,' Pet Network Human Society worker Melissa Shaw told The Times.

'And that's what these puppies needed.

 'They were extremely small. Most of them were all black, and some had little spots of white.

'We later determined they were a mix of German shepherd, black Lab and golden retriever. 

'But that first day, they were muted little creatures, just clinging to life.'

Around-the-clock care: The dogs were so young and so close to death, they needed 24-hour care

Feeding: The pups were bottle fed every two hours until they were healthy enough to feed themselves

Despite being left for dead, the dogs kept fighting.

'At first, they weren't even little balls of fur yet,' Shaw said. 

'They had short hair. 

'They looked like hamsters, but with these little scrunched-up faces.'

Because of the work involved in looking after seven sick puppies, the shelter put them in the care of 'surrogate' volunteers, who were instructed how to act like the animals' mother, such as rubbing their stomachs to prompt them to go to the bathroom.

'With puppies that young and no access to mother's milk, we had to improvise,' Shaw said. 

'Luckily, we have great foster families who took them home for round-the-clock care — night feeds, all of the stuff you do with an infant.' 

Healthy: Workers at the Nevada animal shelter described the dogs as fighters for pushing through

As the pups got bigger, talk of them spread, and people started lining up to see them.

That progressed to people lining up to take them home. 

Soon there was a waiting list of prospective owners.

One family, the Wolfords, read about the dogs online and, touched by the story, were determined to give one a good home.

Mom Kaelan Wolford called the shelter and said: 'Just because you have a lot of families in line doesn't mean they're the best family. We're the best family.'

The shelter agreed, and the Wolfords took home Chief.

Mrs Wolford said the process has taught her children an important lesson about the good and the bad people in the world.
