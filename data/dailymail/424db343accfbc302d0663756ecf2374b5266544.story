Speaking about his new album, Sex And Love, which is out on March 17, he said: 'I wanted to be straightforward. The title describes exactly what the album is about. From day one, I knew that I was going to call it Sex And Love.

'You're going to find songs that mix the two sides, and you're going to find songs that focus on one or the other. Some of it is fun and obviously sexual, while some of it is more introspective and nostalgic. The words go together, but they can be separate and inspire different feelings and thoughts. It's all-encompassing.

'When you turn on the radio, what are the themes that everybody relates to?

'We all relate to sex and love. That's why when you hear music - 90% of the time - it derives from those two feelings. Let's face it. No matter what race, nationality, or religion you are, you have experience with both and you like them!,' he said.

Enrique has called in his famous friends for his new album. Single I'm a Freak sees him collaborate with long-time friend Pitbull, he works with Romeo Santos on Loco and duets with Kylie Minogue on Beautiful.

'It happened really organically,' he says of his collaboration with the Queen of pop. 'Kylie heard it in the studio, and she ended up loving it. She sang her parts, and everything fit so well.'

'When people listen to the album, I hope they can forget whatever's going on and just enjoy it,' concludes Enrique.
