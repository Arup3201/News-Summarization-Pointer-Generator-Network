Hospitalized: Brian McClellen, 21, was engulfed in flames on top of a train to New York at 5am on Sunday. He died today from his horrific injuries 

Investigation: McClellen was likely burnt after coming in contact with a pantograph, a mechanical arm on top of the train that collects power from the overhead wires, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said

McClellen was likely burnt after coming in contact with a pantograph, a mechanical arm on top of the train that collects power from the overhead wires, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said.

He said a crewmember used a fire extinguisher to douse the blaze, but he still endured horrific burns. 

The train, which runs on overhead electrical wires had lost power and the workers had gone up to find out why which is when they found him.

The North Royalton High School graduate who grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, describes himself on social media as an actor and a model based in New York City.

McClellen's agent, Ryan Colby, told The New York Post the actor had been booked last week for both a TV show titled 'Younger' with Hilary Duff and for a Pierce Brosnan movie titled 'Urge.'

He picked 'Younger' and was set to begin work next week, Colby said. 

After his death was announced his Facebook page was inundated with tributes.
