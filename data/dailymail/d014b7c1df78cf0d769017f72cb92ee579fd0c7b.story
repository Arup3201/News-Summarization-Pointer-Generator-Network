She's hit the headlines with her indigence at being told she must pay rent on her lodgings in Kensington Palace, and has been nicknamed Princess Pushy.

But Princess Michael of Kent, 68, has spoken of how she and her husband Prince Michael have been forced to embrace austerity along with the rest of the country, eating all their meals at home since dining in restaurants has become too much of an extravagance, and flying by budget airline easyJet.

And despite having had two nannies when her children Freddie and Gabriella were growing up, the wife of the Queen's cousin said she is certainly not too posh to pick up after her dog, and even has a little poop-a-scoop for the task.

Speaking to Janice Turner in The Times, Princess Michael said: 'I am in very austere economic times too, thank you very much! We've cut back dramatically.

'I mean we never go out to dinner unless we go to somebody's house. We never go to restaurants. That is too extravagant. We invite people here. I cook. Well, if I'm giving a dinner party I get in help.'

The Austrian-Hungarian royal, who was christened Marie Christine Anna Agnes Hedwig Ida and is nicknamed MC by her family, also says she always travels by easyJet to get to Biarritz, by economy class if heading to Europe, and club class only on long-haul flights.

Taking about life in the Kensington Palace set - which includes both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and her husband's brother the Duke of Kent - Princess Michael says: 'It's a bit like living in a square or a crescent... when you meet, it's great, but you don't bump into each other that often.'

The couple walk their black Labrador Shadow in the palace fields, and  always cleans up after him: 'Absolutely! I have a pooper-scooper, a long-handled thing with a little shovel.'

The princess is promoting her first novel, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, an historical tome and the first in a trilogy.
