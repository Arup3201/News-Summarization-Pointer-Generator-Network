A tea caddy carved from a mulberry tree may have been planted by Shakespeare himself has gone under the hammer for £13,000 at auction.

The antique - which features a tiny carved bust of The Bard - was whittled out of wood recovered from the famous tree planted outside the playwright's home.

It lay in a private collection for years but was finally passed on for a five-figure sum after it was sold off at Christie's auction house in London yesterday afternoon.

One of a kind: The tea caddy made from the mulberry tree which grew in William Shakespeare's garden at New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, which sold at Christie's auction house in London yesterday for £13,000

The immaculate caddy, dated 1760, is emblazoned with Shakespeare's coat of arms and contains three ornate sliding-lid compartments decorated with intricate mulberry fruit designs.

Reverend Francis Gastrell - who bought New Place in Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, after Shakespeare's death - had the tree cut down in 1756 after he became fed up with visitors asking to see it.

He had planned to burn the tree but enterprising locals flocked to purchase the wood in order to create Shakespeare souvenirs - kick-starting the historic town's centuries-old tourist industry.

Woodworker George Cooper - whose signature is carved into the 6in high by 10.25in wide wood-and-metal box - created dozens of trinkets from the timber.

Antiquarian John Jordon wrote Cooper was a 'poor joiner of Stratford, whose curiosity excited him to work with what little he was able to purchase into toys, such as tea chests, boxes and tobacco-stoppers etc., some of which were prettily carved.'

Similar items made by Cooper have already fetched large amounts after sparking bidding wars at international auction houses.

A 1759 mulberry wood tea caddy by Cooper was sold at Christie's New York in 1981 for just over $7,000 (£4,300) and is now held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Another was sold anonymously in 2009 at the same venue for $20,625 (£12,500).

Historical records suggest Shakespeare
 planted the original mulberry tree himself after landowners were 
encouraged to grow them to promote UK silk production.

After taking over the New Place property, Rev Gastrell applied for planning permission to extend the garden, but was turned down and his tax was increased.

Furious, the minister retaliated by demolishing the house in 1759, enraging the locals who forced him to leave town.

Since Shakespeare's death, other mulberries have been planted in the New Place garden - all that's left of the original property.

The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust attracted controversy last year when it applied for permission to cut one tree, planted in 1946, to make way for excavation work.
