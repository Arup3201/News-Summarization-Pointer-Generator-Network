Cabin crew for Tianjin Airlines surprised passengers recently when they wore their pyjamas and dressing gowns instead of their usual uniforms on flights across the country.

‘I thought I must be dreaming. I think it worked though as I quickly fell asleep and got a few hours in, which is more than normal for me on a plane.’
