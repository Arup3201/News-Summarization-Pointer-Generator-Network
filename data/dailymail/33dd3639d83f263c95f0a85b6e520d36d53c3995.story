Gordon Brown warned yesterday that Scotland could be ‘lost by mistake’  as the battle against independence was being run  so ineptly.

His explosive intervention, on a rare visit to Westminster, plunged the pro-Union  campaign into turmoil.

The former Prime Minister hit out at the negative tactics of David Cameron, George Osborne and the cross-party Better Together campaign run by his  former Cabinet colleagues Alistair Darling and Douglas Alexander.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he had been motivated to join the fight against independence for the sake of his children, and his children's children

Mr Brown warned that ‘patronising’ 
lectures about the pound and Scotland’s EU membership risked driving 
voters into the hands of the Nationalists.

He suggested it had been ‘very stupid’ not to make a more positive case for staying in the Union.

Mr Brown went on to urge Mr Cameron to accept the challenge of a TV debate against Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.

The suggestion irritated Downing Street, which views the prospect as a poisoned chalice.

Mr Brown’s comments 100 days before the historic vote on September 18 also prompted a backlash from some senior Labour figures.

‘Everything has to be done Gordon’s way or he tries to dismantle it,’ one source said.

Speaking
 at a lunch for journalists, Mr Brown suggested he had come out of 
self-imposed exile on national politics because of fears the  campaign 
to prevent the break-up of the UK is going off the rails.

He
 singled out Mr Osborne’s decision to rule out a deal to share the pound
 and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond’s warnings of major defence job 
losses as errors.

Mr Brown 
was also scathing about the use of Lego figures last week to illustrate 
the claim that Scottish voters would be £1,400 a year better off by 
rejecting independence, with references to fish and chip suppers and 
pies at football matches.

Mr Brown has rarely ventured into British politics since leaving Downing Street in May 2010 with his wife Sarah and sons John and James in the wake of Labour's general election defeat

Labour did not spend too much and did not allow in too many immigrants, Gordon Brown insisted yesterday.

The former premier hit back at critics of his record, blaming the economic crash on private sector greed not lavish public spending.

Mr Brown also took a swipe at Ed Miliband, suggesting the Labour leader was wrong to apologise in 2012 for the last  government’s open-door policy on immigration.

The party left a £150billion budget deficit in 2010. But Mr Brown said criticism of his government’s spending was unfair, pointing to the huge drop in tax revenues in the crisis which pushed up the public debt.

He also insisted global change, not immigration, was the major issue driving support for Ukip.

‘It’s about how we respond, and who gets the benefit from these massive changes, this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy,’ said Mr Brown.

‘Now,
 countries can be lost by mistake,’ he said. ‘And if people come up to 
Scotland, and say “Britain says no to Scotland having a share in the 
currency”, Britain says “you are not going to have defence jobs” or 
Britain says “you have got to go bankrupt” or last week, Britain says 
“vote independence you will lose your fish and chips, pies and you’ll 
lose your holidays in Torremolinos” in a  patronising way that ought to 
be withdrawn immediately…

‘Then
 the issue will become Scotland versus Britain. And people will say the 
debate is do you stand up for Britain or are you for Scotland?’

Mr Brown also issued a wider warning that pressure for devolution within England will grow.

He
 said the debate in Scotland was ‘changing Britain for good’. Notions of
 a unitary state and Westminster sovereignty were ‘dead and buried’.

Mr
 Brown said: ‘I can see years of constitutional change on the agenda if 
someone doesn’t grasp the nettle here and say “look we have got to think
 about what holds us together as Britain”.’

He
 suggested that the Better Together campaign should have made the debate
 about ‘two visions of Scotland’s future’. He went on: ‘One is what I 
call a patriotic vision, that’s the one I support – we have our 
Parliament, our strong sense of nationhood, our own institutions, more 
powers, but we don’t break every link with Britain.

‘Or
 the other one, which says every link is broken.’ This included 
pensions, health funding, the BBC and the Armed Forces, he warned.

The
 SNP was delighted by Mr Brown’s call for Mr Cameron to agree to a TV 
debate with Mr Salmond. But Downing Street yesterday insisted that Mr 
Salmond should face Mr Darling.
