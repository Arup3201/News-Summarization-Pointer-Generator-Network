This is the incredible, split-second moment that a lightning bolt struck above a rainbow over Culver Beach, on the Isle of Wight.

Storm-chasing photographer Jamie Russell captured the image, which shows the last rainbow he is likely to see for a while as the nation braces for another Autumnal blast of fierce winds and driving rain.

The Met Office has warned that 50mph and torrential rain will batter the south of the country tomorrow, with flood alerts issued for most of the southern coast. 

Britain awoke to a cold but crisp Sunday morning as fog and low clouds rolled across the nation's countryside. Sun broke through the dense mist as the morning wore on, but it could be the last bright day for the next week as a band of rain is blown over the country from the Atlantic.

Temperatures reached as low as -2C last night in some parts of the country, as many awoke to the coldest morning so far this year. 

Much of the West Country and East Midlands were covered in a blanket of mist this morning as the low clouds rolled across Glastonbury Tor and the Derbyshire Dales.

The fog lifted as the sun rose, creating an awe-inspiring glow for those who were up early enough to witness it this morning.

But the patchy fog and bright conditions will be blasted away tomorrow as fierce winds and driving rain will blow north from the Atlantic, with the Met Office issuing a flood warning for swathes of the south coast and south-east England.

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: 'It has been quite a chilly start to the day today, but the fog will ease away now for a dry and bright afternoon.

'A band of rain and strong winds are expected in the south throughout the night.'

A yellow 'be aware' flood warning has been issued for the region, where an inch of rain could fall overnight along the coast.

Up to two inches of rain could fall in parts of the West Country, the Met Office said, as Somerset, Devon and Cornwall braces itself for another torrential downpour and winds of up to 50mph.

Commuters could be left with a 'messy situation' as they make their way to work tomorrow, with flooding possible because of leaves blocking drains.

'It will be quite a cold and wet day for those parts. It will be quite breezy which will make it feel rather chilly,' the Met Office forecaster said.

'The wind and rain will make it quite unpleasant. We could be left with a messy situation. We could see drains blocked by leaves making it a not particularly pleasant commute tomorrow.'

Temperatures could also plummet to as low as 1C in parts of Scotland where thick fog is expected in isolated areas. 

A band of rain will sweep across the south of the UK tomorrow, with flood alerts issued for most of the southern coastline

The UK could be in for another chaotic Monday morning, following last week's storm which claimed the lives of two people.

A taxi driver was killed after masonry fell from a building and on to him and his car in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

Earlier on Monday morning a motorcyclist died after colliding with a tractor on a leaf-strewn section of the A4074.

Commuters faced a torrid trip to work as trains were cancelled across the nation by the awful conditions, while floods caused 13-mile tailbacks on the M4 and trees blocked roads. 

More than 10,000 homes lost power as Autumn finally arrived after a prolonged Indian summer and the driest September on record. 

Bad weather wreaked havoc in Lossiemouth, Moray, on Wednesday, when almost 1ft of foamy surface water broke through the harbour wall, after it was beaten down by huge, crashing waves at high tide.

The seawater swamped the roads surrounding the harbour, forcing police to stop residents and motorists moving through the area due to the risk of danger. The mayhem was compounded by strong winds of around 40mph, which swept inland from the coast.
