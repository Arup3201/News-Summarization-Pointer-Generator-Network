Gidget is going back to Pennsylvania.

A Jack Russell terrier that somehow ended up in Oregon more than four months after she went missing from her home near Philadelphia will soon be flown back to the Keystone State.

A microchip implanted in Gidget allowed workers at an animal shelter south of Portland to find the dog's owner. PetLink, the company that manufactured the microchip, will pay for her return flight, said Deborah Wood, manager of Animal Services for Washington County.

'We have no idea how she came from Pennsylvania to Oregon, but we are thrilled that she will be going home safe and sound,' Wood told the Associated Press.

Reunited and it feels so good! Gidget is flying back to her owner in Pennsylvania 

Gidget's odyssey attracted national attention Wednesday, spurring many people to offer money for the flight - from a woman in Vancouver, Washington, to a former East Coast governor who told the AP he wanted to remain anonymous.

Wood said a man also came to the Bonnie L. Hays Animal Shelter and paid for all of its expenses caring for the dog.

Wood said the owner of the dog has asked to remain private, but wants everyone to know she's grateful for the outpouring of support. She did not have the money to fly out to Oregon to retrieve her dog.

A good Samaritan spotted the 7-year-old dog earlier this month wandering in the Portland suburb of Tualatin.

Curious: Gidget's whereabouts between April and September are a mystery. She was thin, but in otherwise good shape when brought to the shelter

Shelter workers contacted the Pennsylvania owner and learned that the dog had been missing since April 22, two days after Easter.

Shelter employee Sheila Farrin told The Oregonian 'She was very surprised and excited. She was like "I have no idea how she got all the way out there."'

Gidget's whereabouts between April and September are a mystery. She was thin, but in otherwise good shape when brought to the shelter.

Wood said Gidget's story is a reminder that it's important to microchip your pet.

On Facebook, the shelter said in a post 'Plans are underway for Gidget's flight home! We have had **dozens** of offers for help. PetLink, the microchip manufacturer, will be paying for and arranging her flight back home. 

'The has been sort of like the plot for a Disney movie, and will soon have its happy ending! Thanks soooo much to the generous hearts of animal lovers!'
