Accused: Raja Pervaiz Ashraf is accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects as well as of buying property in London with money earned through corruption in various scams

Pakistan was plunged deeper into political turmoil today as the country's Supreme Court ordered the arrest of its Prime Minister on charges of corruption involving private power stations.

Raja Pervaiz Ashraf is accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects and of buying property in London with money earned through various shady deals.

He is alleged to have committed the crimes during his reign as minister for water and power before he became the country's premier.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

The prime minister's adviser, Fawad Chaudhry, condemned the court's order, calling it unconstitutional.

The announcement comes as thousands of supporters of a fiery Pakistani cleric who has been calling for election reforms descended onto capital Islamabad, as security officials girded for mass rallies by a movement that has virtually overnight become a powerful but still mysterious force on the political scene.

The dramatic entry into Pakistani politics of Tahir-ul-Qadri, a preacher who until recently lived abroad in Canada and had only a modest local following, has galvanized supporters looking for reforms but worried detractors who fear he'll derail upcoming elections.

Also on Monday, thousands of Shiites finally ended a three-day long protest in the southwestern city of Quetta in which they demanded better security following an attack that killed 86 people.

They had blocked a main road with dozens of the victims' coffins, and finally agreed to bury their relatives after Pakistan's leaders dismissed the government of surrounding Baluchistan province.

Supporters: Qadri has galvanised Pakistani supporters who believe the current government has succeeded in bringing little but electricity blackouts, unemployment, terror attacks and corruption to the country

The protest was launched in the wake 
of a twin bombing at a billiards hall Thursday that targeted members of 
the minority Shiite sect. The demonstrators demanded the provincial 
government be dismissed and the army take over responsibility for the 
city.

Prime Minister Ashraf said in a 
televised address shortly after midnight on Sunday that the governor, 
who is appointed by the central government, would take over in 
Baluchistan, replacing the chief minister elected by the provincial 
assembly.

Also, paramilitary forces will 
receive police powers and launch an operation against militants behind 
the billiards hall attack.

The national government is also worried about security in Islamabad in advance of Qadri's protest. Thousands of police have been deployed in the city, and officers in riot gear are manning the main roads and streets. Authorities used shipping containers to block off the part of Islamabad where most government offices and embassies are located.

About 15,000 of Qadri's supporters 
left Sunday in hundreds of vehicles from the eastern city of Lahore, 
where the headquarters of his Minhaj-ul-Quran organization are located. 
They are expected to arrive in Islamabad later Monday, as more 
supporters join the rally along the way.

Television
footage showed the marchers crowded into buses and vehicles with 
Pakistani flags flying as they made their way toward the capital.

Even before Qadri arrived in the 
capital, thousands rallied on the main avenue running through Islamabad 
that leads to the government headquarters.

Members of the march set up a
make-shift stage on top of one of the shipping containers that were 
supposed to block their way.

Male protesters gathered on one side of the avenue while women and children were on the other, divided by a grass median.

Many of the protesters waved Pakistani flags or photos of Qadri, while songs on religious themes or in praise of Qadri blared through a loudspeaker.

The crowd appeared to be a mix of longtime Qadri followers and new supporters who had been inspired by his anti-government message.

'He feels pain for the people while the government feels no pain for the people,' said Faizan Baig from the northern city of Abbottabad. The 23-year-old said he had come to Islamabad the night before and slept in a shrine on the outskirts of the city.

Qadri's rhetoric has invigorated many Pakistanis like Baig who are angry at the current administration whose five years in office ends this spring. They say the current government has succeeded in bringing little but electricity blackouts, unemployment, terror attacks and corruption.

Qadri returned to Pakistan in December after living for years in Canada, where he's also a citizen. He heads a religious network in Lahore and gained some international prominence by writing a 2010 fatwa, or religious opinion, condemning terrorism.
