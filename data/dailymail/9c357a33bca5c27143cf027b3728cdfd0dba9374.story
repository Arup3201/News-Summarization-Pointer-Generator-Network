It was reefer madness at a Maine high school as nine students were suspended for bringing marijuana-laced cookies to a school event on ethics and values - and sickening some classmates.

Police are investigating after the incident, which occurred on Friday.

Cape Elizabeth schools superintendent Meredith Nadeau said it's unclear whether the students who ate the cookies knew they contained marijuana

Some of them felt ill and went to the nurse's office.

The Portland Press Herald reported that the episode unfolded on Friday during a daylong event featuring speakers addressing the school district's guiding values of 'Community, Academics, Passion and Ethics (CAPE).'

School policy calls for a student who distributes or sells drugs to be suspended for 10 days and face possible expulsion, an action requiring a hearing before the School Board.

The names of the students aren't being released.

The school was the site of another marijuana controversy in 2010, when a boy was kicked out after he sold a pot brownie to a classmate, according to the Press Herald.

The student suffered from an extreme case of buyer's remorse when he was carted to a hospital emergency room after eating the brownie.

The latest pot cookie case came on the same day that two University of Colorado at Boulder students were accused of bringing marijuana-laced brownies to a college class, sickening their unsuspecting professor and five classmates.

Thomas Cunningham, 21, and Mary Essa, 19, were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of second-degree assault, fraudulently inducing the consumption of a controlled substance and conspiracy charges, university police spokesman Ryan Huff said.

Huff said three of those who ate the brownies were hospitalized, suffering from the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active property in marijuana.

'If someone views this as a prank, it's no laughing matter,' Huff told Reuters. 'These [charges] are all felonies which carry potential prison time.'
