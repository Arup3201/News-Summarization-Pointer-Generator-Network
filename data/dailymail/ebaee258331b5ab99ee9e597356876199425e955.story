Blocking people in is not the most obvious way of getting them to leave. But it worked for one farmer, who forced a group of travellers off his land by surrounding them with tractors.

Chris Awdry took direct action when a group of six caravans arrived in his field on Wednesday afternoon.

The 53-year-old initially turned to police for help – but they said it was a civil matter and declined to get involved.

Taking action: Farmer Chris Awdry, 53, took direct action when travellers took over his land and told him to take them to court - so he barricaded them in with his tractors and they asked to leave  

Direct action: Mr Awdry said that the police had said they couldn't help so he 'had to deal with it'

So
 he instructed his workers to drive tractors, trucks and diggers around 
the edge of the 1.5-acre site to block in the travellers as police stood
 by.

And less than three hours after their arrival, the group decided to depart.

Yesterday
 Mr Awdry, who rents the land in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, said: ‘They went
 in and they were ruining the land and we wanted them out. The owner of 
the land didn’t want them there and we did what we could to protect the 
land. 

‘I had asked them nicely to leave but they said they wouldn’t and that I would have to get a court order to move them on.’

He
 added: ‘I contacted the police and they said it was a civil matter. We 
then decided to barricade them in until they went, with the police in 
attendance the whole time to keep the peace.’ Once officers saw what was
 unfolding, they advised the travellers of section 61 of the Public 
Order Act.

The law can be invoked when they are satisfied two or 
more people are trespassing on land and the owner has taken reasonable 
steps to make them leave. Mr Awdry added: ‘I was glad we managed to sort
 it quickly and peacefully.

‘Luckily, it happened on a day when we 
were not so busy harvesting, so we were able to act straight away, 
although even if it had been a busy day we would have still dealt with 
it.’ A farmhand said motorists beeped their horns in support as they saw
 the caravans leaving.

One of the travellers said they had only stopped off for food and to allow their children to rest.

Inspector
 Alan Lumley added: ‘They were peacefully dispersed without the 
necessity of us using police powers. The local land controller has been 
spoken to and no offences have been disclosed.’

He added: ‘We always try and resolve such matters peacefully, although we do have powers to remove them if needed to.’

It
 is not the first time people power has been used to move on travellers.
 In June around 50 villagers took part in a four-hour protest to prevent
 a group from settling on their green.

After 11 caravans arrived in 
the picturesque village of Nepcote, West Sussex, the residents 
surrounded the land and blocked off the entrance with their cars.

Although
 some of the travellers got through, the villagers managed to prevent 
the majority from  parking up. And after several hours, the campaign was
 victorious, with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to
 move on.

However during the tense stand-off, some homeowners were 
warned by the police they could be charged with false imprisonment for 
blocking the travellers.

One eyewitness said at the time: ‘The 
villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go in. 
They blocked the only entrance. It was a great result.’
