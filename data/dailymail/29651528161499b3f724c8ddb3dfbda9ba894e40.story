Iggy Azalea has been left furious after Steve Madden allegedly released images from 'the most disgusting photo shoot ever' to promote her debut line with them, without her approval. 

The rapper took to Twitter on Thursday to lash out at the brand, claiming they shared the photos via company-launched Tumblr page smxiggy.tumblr.com - which has since been taken down - without telling her.

‘Everything in a collaboration is supposed to be mutually approved. But Steve Madden did the most disgusting photo shoot ever and never even told me about it,’ the 24-year-old fumed.

Not happy: Iggy Azalea unleashed on shoe company Steve Madden via a series of furious Tweets, claiming they shared images promoting the upcoming collaboration through a company-launched Tumblr page without telling her

Although Steve Madden have since blocked the page, it wasn't before Iggy could label the images as  ‘god awful.'

However a few hours after her angry tweets, she released three images on her Instagram account from the campaign that she said she 'absolutely loved' alongside a statement.

‘For the record: I absolutely LOVE these images they are from the shoot I directed for my Steve Madden campaign. Im incredibly proud of the shoes we've made together, as well as these images that I've been anxiously waiting to share with you all,’ Iggy wrote next to a montage from the vibrant shoot.  

Angry: The 24-year-old didn't hold back when it came to calling out the popular American shoe brand

In shock: Iggy claims she had no idea about the photos until she saw them on a 'random tumblr' page 

Adding: ‘What I had a "rant" about on Twitter isn't in regards to these pictures, it was about another, different set of images i wasn't a part of creating that I felt weren't reflective of my vision and direction for the collection.’ 

‘I'm an artist and I'm extremely passionate and emotional and crazy sometimes because I care ALOoOoot about this s***! I love Steve and he gets it! Artists clash sometimes, it doesn't mean I dislike the brand.’ 

With her debut shoe line  dropping imminently the star insisted she is looking forward to collaborating with Steve Madden for three more seasons but was simply fighting for her artistic integrity: ‘I love Steve Madden as an individual and as a company,' Iggy defended.

She finished off her long post by saying she truly believed in the collection and that she put her ‘heart and soul’ into making it. 

‘I didn't mean for it to turn into some big blog situation (as usual) but I'm not gonna sit back and totally let Steve Madden get dragged under the bus because as a whole they're awesome ppl. I just don't support neoprene Jesus sandals WITH socks. That all,' she concluded. 

In the approved photos posted to her Instagram account, the Aussie rapper wears a red crop-top and matching shorts as she shows off her endless legs in a pair of royal blue platform shoes from her collection, while a woman holding a goldfish nuzzles up to her. 

Damage control? The website smxiggy.tumblr.com has since been taken down, however the campaign images which earned Iggy's ire are circulating online

Later Iggy leans up against a railing in a green sports bra, waisted white shorts, a flowing kimono and strappy platforms. 

However the 'gross' images in question, which have circulated online, show a woman posing provocatively in socks and sandals.

Earlier in the day, the outspoken star took to Twitter to let off some steam about  a Tumbrl that was believed to be set up by the company. ‘I’m just now seeing it as its uploaded on some random tumblr page and iam [sic] livid,’ she tweeted.

Before adding: ‘I worked really hard on the creative direction of both the shoes and the shoot I WAS involved with and in.’

Putting her foot in it? Hours after her Twitter tirade, the star took to her Instagram account to clear up some things 

Mad about shoe: Iggy has been giving fans a sneak peek of her creations over the last few months. In October the star posted this image saying 'These are just my personal favorites'

‘I really feel it’s been tainted with these God awful images that Steve madden took appon [sic] themselves to create and share without my knowledge. Gross gross gross,’ the blonde beauty raged.

‘Ivd [sic] been bamboozled with a tumblr page where everyone wears sock and taken unintentional crotch shots on pool toys. I’m in shock,’ she capped off the rant.

Iggy has since deleted the tweets. Daily Mail Australia have reached out to both Iggy and Steve Madden for comment.

Her boss T.I., who signed her in 2012, told TMZ that instead of going on Twitter rants, the rapper should be putting her energy into her music. 

Bad timing: The rapper's debut shoe line with Steve Madden is set to drop next month

Winter has finally showed up. The horror! Take a page out of Iggy Azalea's look book and pair a bright graphic print sweater with slim pants and heels.

Iggy's wearing a warm, sequined sweater from Kenzo. The retro 80s print, with a nod to Keith Haring, the sequin trim glams it up and turns it from a novelty sweater into art.

Kenzo is a Japenese designer based in Paris. His clothing, his fragrances, even his accessories are unique and chic. He loves playing with texture and color--can't you tell by this sweater. And his stuff is so well made, it will last decades.

Celeb fans include Rihanna, Lily Allen and Miley Cyrus--that's when she's dressed.

When wearing a print sweater like Iggy, let the sweater do the talking.

'I think she should focus on what got her here and that’s her music, her performing, and just continue to present her talents to the world,' he said.

'It’s just like asking Tom Brady if he should be commenting on Deflate-gate. He should worry about the big game on Sunday. Same with Iggy.'

Indeed the irreverent singer is well-known for her social media tirades and as usual the Twittersphere lit up with many fans weighing in on the drama. 

‘Can see why @IGGYAZALEA is p***** off with the images @SteveMadden put up to promote the new range with her! #tacky,’ one user wrote. 

 Another teaser: Three months ago the rapper shared this snap and gushed: 'Just came in the mail.  Can't wait for spring...'

Before the drama: 'I put all my love and passion into these shoes because this project is sentimental to me,' the rapper stated earlier in the month next to this snap of her name on the Steve Madden label

‘I like Steve Madden, but after this I have lost lots of respect for him. That so was unprofessional,’ another agreed.

But others slammed the Mullumbimby native, calling her out for her constant feuds: ‘Now @IggyAzalea is beefing with her endorser @SteveMadden ? It seems like everyone has got it out for her...’ one person suggested. 

Just three weeks ago Iggy, who is dating NBA pro Nick Young, was singing the shoe company's praises on Instagram after she shared a close-up shot of one of her soon-to-be-released creations.

'It's seriously amazing everytime I see this label. I know to most it's just a shoe but Steve Madden was my S*** when I first came to America.' 

'It's really a full circle moment for me to get to share this tiny little label with Steve inside a shoe (haha), not just another celebrity cosign. I put all my love and passion into these shoes because this project is sentimental to me. I hope when you see them u girls LOvE!,' she wrote. 

A special project tainted? 'It's seriously amazing everytime I see this label. I know to most it's just a shoe but Steve Madden was my S*** when I first came to America,' she said
