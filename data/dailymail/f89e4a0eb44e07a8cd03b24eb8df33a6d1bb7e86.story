This unique shopfront has been frozen in time for more than a decade after its owner left it exactly as it was on the last day of business.

Brian Moore took over George Moore Menswear in Bowes Park, north west London, after his father passed away in 1969.

But when it came time for his own retirement 12 years ago, Mr Moore couldn't bring himself to clear out the family shop, so left everything exactly as it was.

How times haven't changed: 
George Moore Menswear in Bowes Park, London, has been left completely untouched since it closed 12 years ago

Frozen in time: Shirts and ties still line the walls of George Moore Menswear just as they did on the last day of business

Successful: George Moore first founded the store in 1942 during the middle of World War II

The store has remained untouched ever since and become an unusual relic of the fashion of the day.

Even the window display is the same with underwear, shirts and ties still neatly stored in their place. 

The short socks demonstrate how the price of clothing has risen, with the store's 65 per cent cotton pairs costing just £1.99 or £5.50 for three pairs.

There are ties for all occasions hanging from pastel-coloured shirts, as well as gloves and hats hap-hazardously strewn on the white-tiled walls.

Family business: Brian Moore took over the store when his father George died in 1969

Retro: The shirt and tie collection at the store in Bowes Park, London, is dominated by light, pastel colours giving an insight into the fashion of the day

Height of fashion: An unusual display combo including a short-sleeved shirt, patterned jumper and thick gloves

And there is also the odd item of women's clothing with a retro jumper costing £13.95 and containing a tag warning customers it is the 'last one'.

But time has begun to take a hold on the store with sunlight bleaching items left on display.

Mildew has also caused some of the contents to slightly disintegrate, while floating dust particles have wormed their way into the polyester and wool garments.

George Moore managed to successfully establish the firm during the war in 1942. The business was then passed on to his son Brian after his death.

Rare sight: The store has become an unusual attraction in north London

Fashion: The store also stocked the odd piece of women's clothing that are still on display today

Pricey: Two bow-ties and cassette tapes priced at £4.99 also adorn the unusual window display

Mr Moore said he was eventually forced to give up on the shop because 'things were getting desperate'.

He said: 'My father wanted to take things a bit easier so I took over the shop and he just sort of pootled around when he felt like it and had a chat with some of the customers, which he liked to do in those days.

'My father died and I just carried on with my mum up until about 10 or 12 years ago.

'Things were getting desperate and I was getting old so I just decided to call it a day and I closed down and that's the way it's been ever since.'

Decay: Time has begun to take a hold on some of the items with gloves in the window left covered in dust

Retirement: Brian Moore eventually closed the store when he felt he was too old to keep managing it

For every occasion: Shirts for sale at George Moore Menswear varied in price from just £6.75 to £16.50

Fleecy gloves: Polyester is a material frequently listed on products for sale in the Bowes Park store
