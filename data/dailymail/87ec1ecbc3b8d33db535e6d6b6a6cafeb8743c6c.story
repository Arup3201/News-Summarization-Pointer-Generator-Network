A North Carolina newspaper issued a correction to a headline it placed on a letter to the editor on February 6: Obama is not the Antichrist, says the Lexington Dispatch.

What Boyd Thomas wanted fellow readers to know is that the president is actually the Beast's biblical precursor--or, as those with a working knowledge of the prophesied end days know him, the Seventh King.

Along with the correction, the online version of the letter has been amended to read, 'Is Obama the seventh king?'

Correction! A North Carolina printed the headline 'Is Obama the Antichrist' on a letter to the editor February 6. The writer Boyd Thomas actually meant that Obama is the precursor to the Antichrist

To his credit, Thomas does ask that very question to open his 500 word letter. It seems that the Lexington Dispatch just miscounted kings.

Thomas writes:

'God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king?'

He goes on to make the argument that Obama is, in fact, this Antichrist antecedent.

'Obama claims nobody can stop him or change anything he's done,' Thomas says. 'This evil must come to pass before the Lord's return and the rise of the Antichrist, but you better know what evil you're dealing with.' 

Amended: The Lexington Dispatch ran the correction and also amended the online version of Boyd Thomas's letter to read, 'Is Obama the seventh king?'

Just who is the seventh king? According to the English Standard translation of Revelation 17, he is one of those in power who aid the Antichrist in his bid to reign destruction down onto the Earth.

Per Biblehub.com, in part:

And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.'

Boyd Thomas was, in fact, trying to convey that the president is the precursor to the Antichrist
