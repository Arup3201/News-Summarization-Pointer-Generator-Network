A grandmother who needed urgent amputation of her arms after she contracted a flesh-eating virus died when doctors only treated her with painkillers, the High Court has heard.

Suzanne Gardner, 60, of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, was struck by deadly necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on her driveway and cut her arm just before Christmas in 2010.

The fast-moving infection spread up her arms and into her chest and killed her within days. 

High Court judge, Sir David Eady, today ruled that the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was to blame, as he detailed the  inadequate care she was given at the hospital.

He said the grandmother-of-six had arrived with her husband in ‘excruciating pain’, with discoloured and swollen arms and one of them covered in weeping blisters.

‘The only treatment she received over the next few hours was in the form of drugs for the relief of pain and the application of gauzes to the suppurating blisters,' he said.

‘What she needed was an emergency operation for the amputation of both arms and, prior to that, by way of preparation, resuscitation by means of oxygen, fluids and antibiotics.

‘By the time her condition was diagnosed, it was too late and death had become inevitable.’

Mrs Gardner’s husband, Colin, sued the NHS Trust, alleging an unjustified delay in her being seen by a doctor and having her blood tested.

It meant the infection was not noticed until too late. By the time the decision was taken to remove her arms, it had gone too far and she had no chance.

Prior to her going into theatre, Mr Gardner only had time to wish his wife of 40 years good luck and give her a kiss. She died within hours on the afternoon of December 21.

Ruling the NHS Trust to blame, Sir David said the triage when she arrived was ‘hopelessly inadequate’, as very little in the way of observations were taken.

They were first taken almost four hours later, which was ‘woefully late’, he continued.

‘Had Mrs Gardner been treated non-negligently during and following her arrival at the hospital, she could have been ready for an amputation well before 7.30am and would then probably have survived,’ he said.

‘That is, she would have lived but for the delay caused by the breaches of duty identified.’

He continued: ‘I find on a balance of probability that Mrs Gardner would have survived an emergency operation for bilateral amputation and debridement for which she could and should have been ready no later than 6.10am, just over five and a half hours after she arrived.’

High Court judge, Sir David Eady, today ruled that the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was to blame

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs.

It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister.

The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection. As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious.

The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die.

Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death. 

Sir David’s ruling means Mr Gardner is entitled to receive full compensation for the loss of his wife, although the amount will not be revealed.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Gardner said: ‘Suzanne was wonderful, she was looking forward to her upcoming retirement and enjoyed cooking Sunday lunches and spending time with our family.

‘It has been a truly horrific time for us. The lack of care Suzanne received from the hospital led to her being taken too soon.’

Andrea Rusbridge, the family’s lawyer at Access Legal from Shoosmiths, added: ‘Mrs Gardner was a huge part of the lives of her whole family, and her loss has been devastating to them.

‘I hope that with this judgement, changes will be implemented in NGH A&E to make sure patients are properly assessed as soon as they arrive and that more lives are saved from this terrifying infection and other illnesses as a result.’
