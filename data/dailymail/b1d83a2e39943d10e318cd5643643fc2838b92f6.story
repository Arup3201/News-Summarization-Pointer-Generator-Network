Kyle Naughton and AEL Limassol goalkeeper Karim Fergouche were involved in a collision that left the Moroccan with possible concussion and a serious nose injury.

Naughton was chasing the ball when Fergouche came rushing out to meet him. But the 32-year-old mis-timed his dive and his face was caught my Naughton's knee 

To make matters worse, Fergouche was booked for his troubles and the referee awarded Tottenham a penalty. 

Collision: Tottenham defender Kyle Naughton collided with AEL Limassol's goalkeeper Karim Fergouche

Head: Naughton's knee caught Fergouche full on in his face before the Spurs defender was thrown up in the air

Fortunately for Fergouche, his replacement, Andres Romero, saved Harry Kane's tame effort with his legs.

The extent of his injuries are as yet unknown but ITV commentators reported that he had suffered 'possible concussion' and a 'serious nose injury'. 

Spurs led 2-1 from the first leg of their Europa League play-off against the Cypriot side. 

Goals from Roberto Soldado and Kane were enough to put Mauricio Pochettino's side in a strong position to progress where they would join Everton, and possibly Hull, in Friday's draw.

Penalty: Fergouche slid in to tackle Naughton but ended up giving away a penalty and also being booked

Injury: Commentators said Fergouche had suffered 'possible concussion and a serious nose injury'

Stretcher: Fergouche was eventually taken away on a stretcher and his replacement saved the penalty
