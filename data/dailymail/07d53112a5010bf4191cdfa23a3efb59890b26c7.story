Dianne Parr was left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic

A woman who went in to hospital for routine dental surgery has described the hell of being left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic.

Dianne Parr had been admitted to have two teeth extracted after developing abscesses.

The nature of the operation meant she had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body. 

But a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly.

By the time she realised she had no pain relief, she was powerless to move or scream for help.

Mrs Parr says the 40-minute experience was so horrific she feared she would die of a heart attack on the operating table. 

Fully awake - but with her eyes taped shut and with no pain relief - she listened in horror as she heard surgeon asking for the scalpel.

As it cut into her gum, she passed out with what she assumed was shock.

Telling her story on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'It was supposed to be a routine procedure. I had a couple of abscesses on my lower jaw and needed two teeth extracted.'

Because the procedure was urgent, her dentist referred her to her then local hospital in Yorkshire.

'I was assured it was a standard day case and I'd be home by the evening. 

'In fact, it was a catalogue of errors,' she told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden.

Minutes before going into theatre, the anaesthetist had administered something into a tube in the back of her hand and she felt a woozy, relaxed feeling wash over her.

'I began to feel floaty, but then I was aware of being wheeled into theatre,' she said.

'I thought "I'm not asleep", but at the same time I couldn't move - or see. 

'Then I heard the surgeon approach the table and ask the nurse for a metal clamp to keep my mouth open.'

She screamed - but paralysed by muscle-relaxing drugs, she made no sound.

'I could feel the surgeon leaning over me and push down on my body before pulling up.

At this point, he realised her tooth was cracked and coming out in pieces.

'That was when he asked for the scalpel,' she recalled. 

'It felt as if my tooth was coming out of my foot, not my mouth. A searing pain shot up my body.'

Mrs Parr, from St Teath, Cornwall, added: 'I heard the surgeon declare: "It's a toughie".

Using every fibre of strength in her body, she desperately tried to get the surgeon's attention.

The nature of the operation meant Mrs Parr had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body. But a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly, she told  presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden

'He was standing over my right side and I thought if I could just move my right arm to touch him, he would instantly know I was awake. 

'I thought I was going to die - not because of the pain, but the fear. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.'

Worryingly, had observations of her pulse and blood pressure been done during the operation - in accordance with the Royal College of Anaesthetists' guidelines - staff would have realised what was going on.

But Mrs Parr, now 50, later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed.

It also later emerged that the anaesthetist had administered only a dose of atracurium - a commonly used muscle relaxant. This was because her mouth needed to be clamped open to extract her teeth.

Professor Michael Wang, a clinical psychologist at the the University of Leicester,  counselled Mrs Parr for months after her ordeal.

He estimates between 50 and 80 per cent of patients who are awake during surgery suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. 

It is, he says, similar to being tortured.

'Anaesthesia awareness has caused some of the most severe cases of post-traumatic stress disorder I have seen,' he said. 

He added it does not matter whether the operation is a major or minor one.

Mrs Parr told This Morning: 'I initially assumed I must have fainted on the operating table.

'But Professor Wang says it is common for the brain to erase extremely traumatic images and events such as this.'

The anaesthetist had assumed, wrongly, that because it was a dental operation, the surgeon would apply a local anaesthetic to the mouth.

The surgeon, however, drafted in at the last minute because of a list change, had assumed Mrs Parr had already been given a full general anaesthetic.

After 37 minutes, the operation ended and she was given another injection to reverse the relaxant.

'I shot up, desperate to get the ventilator tube out of my throat - I just wanted to gag. I was trying to rip it out. 

'As soon as it was out, I screamed "I don't know what you think you were doing, but I was awake the whole time". 

A hospital inquiry found the anaesthetist negligent and she received a £15,000 out-of-court settlement for the incident in 2002. 

But the mother-of-one said the experience had changed her life forever.

'I changed from an outgoing, laid back person into a woman angry with the whole world,' she said.

'Thankfully my family, my husband Tim, they have all been incredible. I was just in pieces.

'All the time I was on that operating table, thinking they were my last minutes, I was thinking of them.

'I pictured Tim's face, my daughter Dawn's face. Tim is a massive Beatles fan - and we sing together - so I was trying to to remember the words of songs. Anything to take my mind off the pain.' 

Earlier this month, shocking results from a study led by Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists were made public.

But Mrs Parr, now 50, later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed.

The research revealed that 150 people a year in the UK and Ireland report they have been conscious during surgery  - despite being given general anaesthesia. 

Around six million general anaesthetics are administered in the UK each year. According to the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCA), between one and two people in 1,000 experience some degree of anaesthetic awareness.

'Anaesthesia is a scientific balancing act,' said Dr Keith Myerson, an RCA spokesman and a consultant anaesthetist.

'You have to try to ensure pain relief and loss of consciousness while minimising the side-effects of the drugs, such as a reduced supply of oxygen to the blood and the brain.

'But anaesthetists are highly skilled and while incidents of awareness do happen, they are extremely rare.'
