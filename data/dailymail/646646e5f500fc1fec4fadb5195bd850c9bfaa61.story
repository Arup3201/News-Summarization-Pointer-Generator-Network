Lou Vincent has been banned from cricket for life after releasing  a remarkable video  statement which begins with the words: ‘My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.’

The former New Zealand star, whose involvement in match-fixing was laid bare by Sportsmail in May, pleaded guilty to 18 breaches of the ECB’s anti-corruption regulations, relating to three county matches. He also confessed to seven charges pertaining to the 2012 Twenty20 Champions League in South Africa.

Vincent said: ‘I have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing.

That's the end: Lou Vincent has been slapped with a lifetime ban after confessing to match-fixing

Coming clean: Vincent has been facing fixing charges in multiple countries, and broke his public silence

‘I have lived with this dark secret 
for so many years, but months ago I reached the point where I decided I 
had to come forward and tell the truth.

‘It’s a truth that has rightly caused 
uproar and controversy in New Zealand and around the world. I have 
shamed my country, I have shamed my sport, I have shamed those close to 
me. And for that, I am not proud.’

His four-and-a-half-minute statement 
was posted on the 3news.co.nz website a few hours before the ECB 
announced his ban, which will apply worldwide.

It follows the life ban handed down to
 Pakistani seamer Naved Arif, who conspired with Vincent to fix Sussex’s
 40-over game against Kent at Hove in August 2011.

The 18 charges laid at Vincent’s door 
relate to that match plus two Twenty20 fixtures he played — for 
Lancashire against Durham in 2008 and for Sussex against Lancashire 
three years later.

Six weeks ago, former England and 
Lancashire batsman Mal Loye told Sportsmail how  Vincent offered him 
£10,000 to score fewer than 10 runs in the game against Durham. Vincent 
doubled the offer the next day. Loye turned him down.

ECB chief executive David Collier 
said: ‘We are extremely pleased that the matter has now been brought to a
 satisfactory conclusion and that an individual who repeatedly sought to
 involve others in corrupt activity for his own personal gain has 
accepted that his conduct warrants a lifetime ban from cricket.’

Vincent, 35, who played 23 Tests and 
102 one-day internationals between 2001 and 2007, said he had been 
persuaded to come clean after meeting his future wife Susie and learning
 about ‘unconditional love’.

He said: ‘I can finally look my 
children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy — 
even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times. I now believe in
 myself as a  person again and I don’t wake up every morning hating 
myself.

‘Today is the day I offer my deepest, 
deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world, to the loyal 
fans, to the dedicated coaches, staff,  players past and present.’

He refused to blame the depression he suffers for his misdeeds, adding: ‘My actions I will regret for the rest of my life.’

That was echoed by ICC chief executive
 Dave Richardson, who said: ‘I encourage all the players to note how 
engagement in this type of activity can destroy careers and lives.’

England all-rounder Stuart Broad also applauded Vincent’s life ban.

‘That would scare a lot of people out 
of it, I’d hope,’ he said. ‘For a lot of people who play cricket, 
cricket is everything to them. You finish your career at 35. If you get a
 life ban from cricket then what on earth are you going to do with your 
life?’

Four cricketers have been imprisoned 
in England for the involvement in corruption: the Pakistani trio Salman 
Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer, plus Essex seamer Mervyn 
Westfield.

But the possibility of criminal 
proceedings against Vincent would depend on whether the Crown 
Prosecution Service  considered a trial to be a sensible use of public 
funds.

My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat

I have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing.

I have lived with this dark secret for so many years, but months ago I reached the point where I decided I had to come forward and tell the truth.

It's a truth that has rightly caused uproar and controversy in New Zealand and around the world. I have shamed my country, I have shamed my sport, I have shamed those close to me. And for that, I am not proud.

I lost faith in myself, in the game, I abused the game I loved. I had to put things right.

Speaking out, exposing the truth, laying bare the things I have done wrong, is the only way I could find to begin to put things right.

The time has come for me now to face them like a man and accept the consequences – whatever they may be.

I could not live with my wrongdoings any longer and after meeting my future wife Susie, after learning what unconditional love really is, I felt strong enough to tell her what I'd done and she has helped me take the painful steps in telling my parents, my wider family and then the authorities.

I am proud of the ones I love, especially my immediate family and friends. Their strength, support and forgiveness has enabled me to address some of the deepest, most uncomfortable issues one can face.

I can finally look my children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy – even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times.

I now believe in myself as a person again and I don't wake up every morning hating myself.

Today is the day I offer my deepest, deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world, to the loyal fans, to the dedicated coaches, staff, players past and present.

I apologise to and thank the ACSU for the help and support that is out there for all players, that has helped me a great deal, Chris Morris and his legal team and all the associations that have handled the sensitive situation with professionalism and respect.

The people who know me know I'm vulnerable, but they also know that I am not stupid. And I know what is right and what is wrong.

I do suffer from depression – that is absolutely no excuse for all I've done wrong.

I used to think mistakes were made by bad people, but now I even know that good people can make the worst of mistakes.

My actions I will regret for the rest of my life.

For sport to prosper, it is up to players to police the game, because they are the ones that will ultimately lose out and allow themselves to be used as pawns to make money.

No one should ever be put in a position and no one should ever allow themselves to forget what sport is about and let money rule their decisions.

The decisions I made were wrong. Players must be better than that; above reproach, for the fans, for the sport.

For the first time in a very long time I feel positive about my future, I am finally becoming the man I want to be. I have to face up to my wrongs and make them right.

I have kept my head down for too long now and it's time to man up to my mistakes and today, I can stand with a better conscience because I know I am doing the right thing.

It is entirely my fault and I'll never be able to stand in front of a game again, it's entirely my fault that I will not be able to apply my skills in a positive way to help future cricketers, but it is entirely possible that I can use this moment to convince others not to be tempted by wrongdoing.

To do the right thing for themselves, for family and friends and for the sport they love.I accept my punishment.
