Reviled Clippers owner Donald Sterling had a public row with girlfriend V. Stiviano just moments before she defended him in an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday.

Sterling reportedly yelled at a silent Stiviano as they rode an elevator at the Four Seasons hotel in Los Angeles where the interview was taped, calling her a 'media w****'

'Then he looks at her and says, "Get off this f****** elevator! Get off this elevator and shut the f*** up!' a guest who rode in a hotel elevator with the couple told the New York Daily News.

Stiviano then pressed a random button and got off at the 15th floor. Sterling continued to yell at a man who appeared to be his lawyer, complaining about Stiviano.

'He was yelling, "She's f****** crazy! I can't deal with her! She's nuts"' the source reported.

The witness says Sterling rode the elevator down to the lobby and then stormed out of the hotel.Twenty minutes later, Stiviano sat down for an interview with Walters, in which she said she loved Sterling and that he is a 'very generous and kind man'. 

The interview was the first time 31-year-old Stiviano has spoken publicly about the scandal surrounding her and Sterling.

The 81-year-old Clippers owner was banned from the NBA last week after audio recordings surfaced of him making racist comments to Stiviano. In the recordings, Sterling tells Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram.

Despite being chewed out by Sterling just minutes before, Stiviano spoke fondly of him saying she doesn't believe he's a racist.

'I think the things he says are not the things he feels,' she said. 'Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.'

On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver
 banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5million and urged league owners
 to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners 
is required to force him to sell.

Sterling's estranged wife Shelly is also in favor of the decision to force her husband out, saying she 'fully supported' Silver's action.

'As a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomploished exectuive leadership for the Clippers,' she said in a statement Saturday.

'As a co-owner, I am fully committed to taking the necessary steps to make the Clippers the best team in the NBA. That has been my aspiration ever since 1981.'

Mrs Sterling is still married to her husband but the two have been seperated him for several years.

She was present as the Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors in a playoff game on Saturday.

Stiviano told Walters that she 'absolutely' thinks Sterling should apologize for his comments, but that 'only God knows' if he will.

She also said she believes Sterling's outrageous comments were, in part, a generational issue.

'I think Mr Sterling's from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things,' she said, before accidentally tipping Walters off that despite being a Jew, Sterling has anti-Semitic views also.

'But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown himself to be a very generous and kind man,' she said.

The racist diatribe which Sterling can be heard making on audio recorded by Stiviano herself, was prompted by people saying bad things about Sterling's relationship with Stiviano.

In abstract and sometimes rambling 
terms, Stiviano appeared to paint herself as Sterling's savior during 
his time of need - despite the fact that it is alleged she released the 
recordings responsible for his downfall herself.

'I
 think Mr Sterling is being tested right now, by a higher power or 
being. And I'm forced to come to his rescue because he can't rescue 
himself.'

When pressed to 
explain the relationship between herself and Sterling, Stiviano said, 
'I'm Mr Sterling's personal assistant. Like I said, I'm his right hand. 
I'm his wingman. What isn't there to understand?'

Walters asked whether Stiviano, then, is Sterling's employee.

'He
 first started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me 
off the books,' she responded, no doubt referring to the million-dollar 
home, four luxury cars and $240,000 'living expenses' she has reportedly
 received.

'I became part of
 Mr Sterling's team. I became someone who protected him, someone who 
took care of him, someone who watched everything he said and did, and 
people did not like that.'

'So you helped him become a better person?' asked Walters.

'In every way. In every way,' responded Stiviano.

'Silly rabbit': V. Stiviano described herself to Barbara Walters as Donald Sterling's 'everything'

She wouldn't allow Sterling to take meetings with certain people, Stiviano told Walters, which angered his business peers.

She
 said that executives and board members of the Clippers who were jealous
 of the free reign she had when it came to the team would call Sterling 
and tell him that Stiviano had brought people 'who look a certain way' 
to Clippers games when she wasn't there.

But
 not just black people, Stiviano claimed, but people 'that didn't give 
me a good look,' like 'gangsters,' 'thugs,' 'bad women.'

Walters asked, 'Are you in love with Donald Sterling?'

'I love him,' Stiviano responded, smiling widely, adding that she's not in love but rather loves him 'like a father figure.'

Denying she's Sterling's 'mistress' or 'whore,' she said that she's more like his friend and right hand.

'I’m Mr. Sterling’s everything. I’m his confidante, his best friend, his silly rabbit,' she said, bizarrely.

Stiviano
 said the pair met while she was working for Sterling's non-profit 
organization, the Donald T Sterling Foundation and evolved 'to so much 
more.'

After the lengthy talk with Walters, Stiviano put her now-customary visor back over her face to face the waiting paparazzi. She told Walters it is a protective measure.

'I'm hurting, I'm in pain. It hurts to see someone you  care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you ... It's easier to mask the pain.'

Sterling was initially supposed to give 
an interview to both Walters and CNN's Anderson Cooper, but dropped out 
at the last minute. Walters got to continue with a solo interview of 
Stiviano while Cooper came out empty-handed.
