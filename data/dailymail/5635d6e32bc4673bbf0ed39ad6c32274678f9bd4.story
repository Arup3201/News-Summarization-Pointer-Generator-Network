A bride-to-be who lost her fiancé in a Christmas Day car crash said a tearful farewell to him as she buried him in his wedding suit.

Debbie Smyth joined hundreds of mourners at the funeral of Mark Price, 51, her partner of nine years who she was due to marry on Saturday.

Before the  service, Ms Smyth said: 'My heart is broken and I can’t stop crying. We were so excited about the wedding. It was going to be such a special day. Now I’ve decided to bury him in his wedding suit. It seems fitting, at least he’ll get to wear it.'

Mr Price was driving along the A606 in Leicestershire in his Toyota Auris when it collided with a Ford C-Max driven by Lynda Anne Wade, 48 at 8.50 on Christmas morning. 

Unfortunately both Mr Price and Ms Wade were killed at the scene.  

Mr Price and Ms Smyth were due to be married on Saturday. 

Paying tribute to her partner, Ms Smyth said: 'He had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody. I lost my brother, aged 50, to a heart attack a few years ago. We were so shocked by the suddenness and from then on decided to live life to the full.' 

Mr Price's friend Malcolm Brown said: 'Mark and Debbie missed the wedding, the honeymoon and a life together. Mark just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time – a Sliding Doors moment.'

The thanksgiving service, followed by a private burial, was held at their village’s Anglican parish church of St Mary and St John – less than a mile from Rothley Court Hotel where the couple had been due to marry in three days.

The couple had enjoyed a Midnight service at the church on Christmas Eve.

The Rev. Gladstone said: 'I shook hands with him in this church a few hours before he tragically died. He was looking forward to celebrating Christmas and his marriage to Debbie.'

The couple met while working in Loughborough University and had recently moved into their dream cottage.
