PC Christopher Higgs was in relationships with four women between 2009 and 2012 and defrauded them of  £38,307 in order to fund his gambling addiction

A police officer has been jailed after he defrauded four vulnerable women out of tens of thousands of pounds in order to fund his gambling addiction.

PC Christopher Higgs, 30, of Helston, Cornwall, was in relationships with four different women between 2009 and 2012 and defrauded them of a total of £38,307.

Plymouth Crown Court heard that the women 'fell foul of his charms' and when that did not work on them he 'cajoled them or threatened them'.

During the course of his relationships with his victims Higgs, a father-of-one,  would tell them he had debts, either from previous relationships or in the form of household bills.

He would emotionally blackmail them claiming to be depressed and suicidal at the pressure his debts were putting him under.

Placing their trust in Higgs as a police officer his victims all agreed to lend him money.

But when Higgs' lies started to unravel he began blackmailing his victims, the court heard.

He told one that if she didn't lie to the police for him he would get social services involved in an ongoing family dispute she was having.

One of his victims even took out loans from the bank on his behalf on the agreement that he would pay the monthly bills. 

Higgs defrauded his victims to fund his gambling addiction, which the court heard had cost him £163,640 to date.

He has now been jailed for five years and two months after he admitted 16 counts of fraud, perverting the course of justice, intimidation and blackmail.

During sentencing at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday Judge Paul Darlow described Higgs as 'a disgrace to the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.'

The victims each made statements in which they told of the horrendous effects suffered at his hands.

One of them, a single mother, said he pressurised her daily into handing over money and 'begged and pleaded for money'.

She said she was left 'unable to feed herself' and she was left 'on her hands and knees begging as Higgs laughed in her face'

She said it was 'a horrific nightmare he put me under'.

Another victim  said she was manipulated and preyed on by Higgs and branded him 'scum'

She said Higgs threatened suicide – and he even stole money from the victim's young son.

In a victim impact statement read out in court, one woman said: 'I was in a vulnerable position when Chris Higgs lied to me.

'He abused his position as a police officer and a friend. I am now struggling to make ends meet because of the debt he left me in.'

Jason Taylor, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Higgs clearly had a gambling problem, and to fund this he manipulated women.

'They fell foul of his charms and when that failed him he turned to intimidation and cajoling.

'Over the course of his relationships he applied psychological pressure in the form of saying he was suicidal.' 

Robert Linford, defending, said: 'He did not set out to befriend each of the complainants in order to defraud them. 

'They were people for whom he had a genuine feeling of affection and for whom he wanted to be with.

'In the background Christopher Higgs had a secret addiction. To most of us who have never had an addiction, that word may sound like an excuse.

'This is no excuse for what he did, but it's the reason that lay behind his shameful years of offending.

'At the time the word of Christopher Higgs was only as good as his next bet.' 

Judge Paul Darlow told Higgs: 'Over a period of three years you defrauded single women who until they met you were financially independent.

'You got them to part with large sums of money they could ill afford to lose.

'They did not have much but it was their own. 

'The fact it was used in gambling makes the matter worse. 

'You are a disgrace to the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.'

Because he has no assets the judge made a nominal £1 confiscation order against Higgs, who was led away from the dock in handcuffs.  

Higgs, who served as a response police officer in the Helston area, has been suspended from duties since January 2013.

He will now be subject to a fast track internal disciplinary process.

Detective Superintendent Sam De Reya said: 'PC Higgs has acted in a wholly inappropriate and criminal manner for which he has rightly been convicted at court.

'As soon as these allegations came to light, PC Higgs was suspended and a full investigation launched which identified the victims and witnesses who have supported the investigation and criminal case.

'As a priority the Chief Constable of Devon & Cornwall Police will now oversee a special case hearing to complete the misconduct process and finalise PC Higg's current position as a police constable.'

Det Supt De Reya added: 'Devon & Cornwall Police expects the highest ethical and professional conduct from all officers and staff operating within the force. 

'PC Higgs' actions have fallen well below the standards expected on a number of occasions resulting in criminal offences being identified.

'The offences significantly impacted the victims who were members of the public, colleagues, family and friends and our thoughts and considerations are with them as PC Higgs begins his custodial sentence.'
