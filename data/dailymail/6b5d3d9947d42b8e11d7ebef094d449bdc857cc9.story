A group of street children in Old Delhi have opened their own bank.

The bank, known as the Children's Development Khazana (CDK), was set up and is now run by children in the Fatehpuri neighbourhood of Old Delhi.

The bank was established on the principle the children would make all the rules and 
decisions.

Show them how it's done: Street children queue up at the counter to deposit money at their very own bank

Deposit: Children wait to deposit their earnings at the bank - called the Children's Development Khazana

NGO volunteers from child rights organisation Butterflies, however, assist the day-to-day running of the bank and sort out any logistical issues.

Children
aged nine to 18 can deposit a small amount and get 3.5 percent on their deposits.

It is open seven days a week and is run by perhaps the youngest manager in the world - 13-year-old Sonu.

He said: 'I ran away from home and started working at a tea stall. It was bad. Then I met some volunteers who told me about the bank. I came here. Now I go to school and I am the (bank) manager also.

Patience: Those who hold an account may deposit a small amount and get 3.5 per cent interest

Earnings: The bank is managed by 13-year-old Sonu (left) who joined the bank after running away from home

'Kids make deposits. They can withdraw anytime if they have to buy something like clothes or eatables. The bank is open seven days a week.'

Fourteen-year-old Sheru, who lived on a railway platform, is a regular.

He said: 'I
have started saving money in the Children's Bank. I sell water bottles.
I put all the money that I earn into my account. I have saved Rs 5000-6000 so far. I want to save more in the future.'

Work: Sonu worked briefly in a tea stall before joining the bank - which is overseen by charity Butterflies

Saving up: A child makes a deposit. Some members have saved up as much as £50-£60 through the bank

Open all hours: Sonu runs a tight ship and his bank is open seven days a week

Sheru says he wants to become a photographer when he grows up. He hopes to save enough to buy a camera one day.

Raheemam, 15, who works as a rag 
picker, also has an 
account.

She
said: 'I used to lose my money. One day, I met a sister (NGO 
volunteer). She told me about the children's bank. So I came here.

'Now I
work more freely. I know my money is safe. I can withdraw money when 
the need arises.'

Paperwork: Four members show their pass books - which are needed to make a deposit

Pass book: Information such as name and date of account opening is included in the document

Charity program manager at Butterflies, Shashidhar Sabnavis, said:"Street children were telling us that they lose their money. Or they tend to spend their money here and there.

"So, we at Butterflies decided on the idea of operationalizing a bank for them.

"They use their savings in the khazana
(bank) to meet their future needs.

"Some of them use their money to go 
for higher education, or vocational training. Some of them use it to 
start small business enterprises.'

The charity also provides education, shelter and care for Delhi's vulnerable children.

Future: It is hoped the members, two with passbooks pictured, learn life skills while staying at the shelter

Education: The NGO also runs classes for the children (pictured) and offers them shelter and food

Learning: Many of the children were not in school - one class pictured - before they joined the NGO

A teacher working for the organisation Firdaus Ahma said: 'Some kids here have jobs. They work in shops or tea stalls. We talk to those kids and motivate them to study and join our classes.

'This helps us bring them into the mainstream.

'When kids start depositing their earnings in the bank. That is an education for life. They will inculcate the habit of making savings. This will become a habit and help them in the future.'

The CDK initiative has won numerous accolades, leading to them expanding the scheme to other parts of Delhi.

Studies: A class takes place inside the shelter - which has won numerous awards for its work with children

Facilities: The children are given computer training (pictured) while at the shelter

Now Butterflies plan to introduce the initiative in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh as well as some parts of Africa.

Sharon Jacob, a child rights activist, said: 'This program has to go out and reach as many needy kids as possible. It can change lives.

'This is a bank for the kids who live their life on the streets. The bank motivates these kids - it offers them a future.'
