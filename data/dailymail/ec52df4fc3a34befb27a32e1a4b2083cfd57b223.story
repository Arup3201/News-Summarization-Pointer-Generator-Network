A secret song by singing superstar Michael Jackson has been discovered, in which he professes his love for the county of Gloucestershire.

The unreleased demo by the King of Pop is believed to have been inspired by a visit he made to the West Country as a child with The Jackson Five.

He reportedly said the time he spent in the county was among his happiest memories.

The song ‘Days in Gloucestershire’ was recorded in 2003-4 and reworked in 2008 but never released.

'Like we really used to before we met the fall,

I can’t get it back, my youth is gone,

We really had it all, oh,

Hold my like you really used to,

Summers in Gloucestershire,

The air has changed,

The city won’t light in and about you,

I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire,

I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire,

I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again.'

It remained unheard and unknown until it mysteriously appeared recently on YouTube.

The song lasts 4.35 minutes, during which Jackson sings about missing the time he spent as a youth in the county.

He sings: 'I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire. I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again.'

The song was leaked onto the internet around two months ago and has already racked up almost 13,000 views.

Among the comments, Gloucestershire resident Maxien Fisher says: 'It does sound like a demo though as some of the music isn’t quite up to Jackson standard.

'I imagine he would have perfected this beautifully.

'I’m glad to be living in Gloucestershire now... Thanks Michael x?'

It is thought Jackson planned to complete the track on a recording trip to London in 2009 but he died just months before the visit.
