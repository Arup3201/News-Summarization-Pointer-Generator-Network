A French man who captured an 'evocative' scene of two dogs drinking from a pond has been named the Royal Horticultural Society's Photographer of the Year.

The photograph, which features the animals standing next to a series of abstract sculptures, was taken by photographer Alain Jouno as the sun set over the Parc Botanique de Haute Bretagne, in Brittany.

While 17-year-old Catherine Sim, from Glasgow, won the RHS Young Photographer of the Year award for her striking image of a crow in flight.

'Evocative': This photo of two dogs drinking from a pond at the Parc Botanique de Haute Bretagne, in Brittany, won this year's competition

Striking: 17-year-old Catherine Sim, from Glasgow, was named RHS Young Photographer of the Year for this photograph of a crow in flight

Tranquil: Scottish photographer Robert Fulton was highly commended by judges for this atmospheric photograph, titled Island Mist

The winning photographs beat thousands of entries from around the world, with stand-out shots including scenes of snow-covered gardens and close-ups of flowers.

A winner was also chosen in each of the five adult categories - plants, abstracts and details, celebrating gardens, seasons and wildlife. Two were selected from under-18s entries, which had to depict something plant, garden or wildlife-related.

rass sprinkled with morning dew, butterflies and buzzards were among the subjects captured in the photographs highly commended by judges. 

Of the overall winner, judge Chris Young, editor of The Garden magazine, said: 'Alain's brilliant image is more than the sum of its parts.

'The serendipity of the sunset, the abstract sculptural forms, the dogs drinking the water and the mist beyond create an incredibly evocative image.'

He added: 'This is a well-composed photograph that truly reflects a moment in a garden's time.'

Mr Jouno, who won £2,000 and a year's gift RHS membership for his photograph, said: 'It's hard to believe I have won, because I am only a modest amateur photographer.

Crisp: This shot of the snow-covered RHS garden Wisley, in Woking, taken by Sarah Longes, was named winner of the seasons category

Runner-up: The View, by Christine Fitzgerald, which features four children gazing out across a garden, came in second place

Dynamic: Blake Wardle, a 16-year-old amateur photographer from Bolton, was highly commended  for this photograph, titled Eurasian Buzzard

Fresh: This scene, capturing a frosty morning at Horsey, Norfolk, was taken by Justin Minns. It came in second place in the seasons category

'I entered the competition to share the beauty of the Botanical Park of Haute Bretagne. I took the image one evening as the mist was rising and the sky was lit by the setting sun.'

The judges said the quality of pictures in the under-18 categories were extraordinary, making it hard to pick a winner.

Of Miss Sim's winning photograph, Mr Young said: 'Some images are evocative, some are artistic and some stop you  in your tracks. This image does all three. It is beautifully captured moment.'

The 17-year-old, who wins £500 to spend on the Wex Photographic website, said: 'I am so passionate about photography, and getting recognition for something that I love doing is so rewarding and makes all those hours trying to get the perfect shot so worthwhile.

'It is definitely the highlight of my year.'
