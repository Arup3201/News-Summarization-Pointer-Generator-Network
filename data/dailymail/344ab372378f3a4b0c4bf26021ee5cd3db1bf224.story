What christening gift do you choose for the boy who is going to have everything?

A £7,000 silver sculpture of his hands and feet, of course.

At least, that’s what Pippa Middleton has bought for her baby nephew, Prince George. And while the unusual gift may strike some as a little creepy, Miss Middleton evidently thinks it’s cute.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister had the bespoke keepsakes made by a small London company.

To create the moulds, the three-month-old future king would have had his limbs placed in a jelly-like organic mixture made of water and a seaweed-based powder.

The process takes only 30 seconds – but as any mother would testify, that’s a long time for a wriggling newborn to sit still. Whether Kate and William knew about the extravagant gift in advance is unknown.

According to Wrightson and Platt, the company which makes the sculptures, baby hands and feet ‘life cast in silver’, are ‘a perfect keepsake to preserve precious memories in the finest materials’. Each set comes with personalised engravings.

Prices start at £1,900 for a pair of bronze hands and feet. For solid silver – the traditional christening metal – buyers can pay anything upwards of £6,200, depending on the size of the child and the engravings.

It costs at least £3,000 for a pair 
of feet and £3,200 for the hands. It is believed Miss Middleton may have
 spent as much as £7,000.

The company, which began in a south London studio in 2000, has no fixed price for a gold set.

Buyers can also choose cufflinks or a necklace featuring miniature versions of the sculptures.

Miss Middleton, party-planner and socialite, may have taken her inspiration from one of little George’s ancestors.

In the mid-1880s, Queen Victoria commissioned sculptor Mary Thorneycroft to carve her nine children’s hands, feet and limbs in alabaster.

The figures certainly influenced Denise Wrightson, one of the founders of Wrightson and Platt, to begin sculpting limbs in bronze, silver and gold.

A spokesman for Clarence House would not confirm or deny that the sculptures had been given as a present. He said: ‘If such a gift exists it would be a private gift and not be something we would be aware of.’

Meanwhile members of the Cabinet chose a more traditional gift for the baby prince – a hand-crafted pine toy box, which cost £400. Although for a slightly more modest option, they needed to go no further than George’s own grandfather, Prince Charles.

woman born in the reign of George III.
