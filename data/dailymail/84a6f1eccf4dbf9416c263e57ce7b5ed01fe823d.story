If you're feeling guilty about taking a break from your text books or revision notes to read this article, relax - you're doing the right thing.

Research shows learning is much more effective when spread over time than relying on last-minute cramming.

The developing skills of hundreds of thousands of people were analysed as they learned how to play a simple online game.

Academics concluded it was better to practice for a while and then have a rest compared to continuously playing in the hope of improving.

In fact, leaving an entire day between sessions strengthened performance, rather than weakened it.

Professor Tom Stafford, a psychologist from the University of Sheffield who helped analyse the data, said: 'The study suggests that learning can be improved.

'You can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level.' More than 850,000 people were monitored as they played Axon, which involves rapid decision-making to click on the correct parts of a screen to grow neurons.

Players were found to improve faster when they left gaps between sessions because it allows the brain to file away information.

Those who played for two hours on two consecutive days generally did better than someone who practised continuously for four hours, for example.

Professor Stafford said the perception that more is learned by cramming is illusory and recommended taking breaks between study sessions.

The amount of time spent learning is not as important as how well the studying is structured, he explained.

Up to a quarter of students at some leading universities are estimated to have experimented with 'cognitive enhancing drugs' in the hope of boosting grades.

A black market in prescription-only medicines such as Modafinil, a stimulant used to treat sleeping disorder narcolepsy, has sprung up.

Medical experts are concerned about the long-term effects, which are not known. Short-term effects include vomiting, headaches, irrational behaviour, palpitations and poor sleep patterns.

A separate study last year found 61 per cent of students stayed up late the day before an exam and 40 per cent crammed throughout the night.

Around two-thirds changed their diet before exams in the hope certain foods would help boost their memory. This included 53 per cent who started eating oily fish and 46 per cent who had more fruit and vegetables.

A third even admitted wearing 'good luck underwear' to improve their exam chances.

Revision expert Patrick Wilson said at the time that students should stick to proper revision.

'The best way to feel truly confident and help beat that stomach-churning exam angst is to prepare for each exam in advance, making sure you have a dedicated structure for your revision schedule,' he added.
