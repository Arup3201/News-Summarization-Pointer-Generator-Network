An 18-year-old girl has been fatally hit by a train while using her earphones during an argument with her father on her cell.

Brittney Silva was struck by the Amtrak train as she walked on the tracks at Hesperian Boulevard near her home in San Leandro, California at 5.55pm on Monday.

A man had tried to warn her as the train hurtled towards her but she 'did not respond to the witness, possibly 
as a result of her not being able to hear him', San Leandro police 
Lt. Rick DeCosta said.

Her body was found about 50 yards from the track, with her pink phone nearby.

Tragedy: Brittney Silva, 18, died on Monday night after being struck by a train. She was wearing her earphones to have a phone conversation and was not aware of the train coming, witnesses told police

The teenager, who was due to begin college this fall, was using her earphones as she spoke with her father, her stepfather Brian Crist told the San Francisco Chronicle.

'She was upset and distracted,' he said.

The railroad crossing was working properly at the time of the tragedy. The southbound train came to a stop several hundred yards after she was hit. None of the passengers on board was hurt.

Her mother, Cynthia Silva, said she had often warned told her daughter only to wear one of the earbuds while she was on the phone, in case it was stolen from her.

Heartbroken: Her mother Cynthia, right, said she was always telling her daughter to leave one of the earbuds out so she was aware of her surroundings but she often didn't listen

Loss: She was just about to graduate high school and hoped to become an obstetrician, her mother said

'I've told my kids time and time and time
 again until I was blue in the face - and I will tell all of the 
youngsters out there - when you're walking down the street and you got 
your headphones on, keep one headphone in and one headphone out so you 
can hear the world around you,' she said.

'I believe that if she had listened to me and done what I said, she would have heard the train coming.'

Friends laid flowers at the scene of the tragedy on Tuesday as they broke down in tears.

Brittney, who had offers to attend UC Santa Cruz, Humboldt State University and California State University East Bay in Hayward, hoped to be an obstetrician or marine biologist.

Scene: She was walking near her home in San Leondro, California on Monday evening when she walked over this crossing, unaware of the approaching train. Her body was found 50 yards away

'She had the whole world in the palm of her hand,' her mother said.

'Everyone loved her,' her 11-year-old sister Melody said. 'She would always dance, and she would always give me great advice about life.'

The most recent statistics, from 2010, show that more than 1,500 pedestrians were treated in emergency roomsfor injuries suffered while walking and using cell phones, double five years earlier.
