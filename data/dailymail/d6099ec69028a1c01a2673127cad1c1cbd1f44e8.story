Ashya King was yesterday ‘laughing and playing with toy cars’ as plans were made to fly him to Prague for the treatment his parents hope could save his life.

The five-year-old, who is suffering from a brain tumour, is currently in hospital in Malaga, southern Spain, with his parents, Brett and Naghmeh, by his bedside.

The family was dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge late on Friday to allow Ashya, who is a ward of court, to undergo pioneering proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic.

British doctors have insisted the treatment is not suitable for Ashya’s type of tumour. The Kings disagree – and sparked an international manhunt after they discharged him from Southampton Hospital and went to Spain against medical advice.

Staff at the £30 million Proton Therapy Centre in Prague are due to meet tomorrow to finalise plans for Ashya’s treatment. It is understood he will first undergo chemotherapy at the city’s Motol University Hospital before being moved to the private clinic five miles away.

His treatment could cost around £60,000. Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, the family’s lawyer, said yesterday: ‘Finally the English authorities are allowing Ashya to travel to Prague. 

‘There are two options. One is a private plane, which has already been costed, and which would take Ashya straight to Prague with all the appropriate medical facilities, including doctors and nurses who would look after him.

‘The other and the preferred option is a plane provided by the hospital in Prague.’

He added: ‘Ashya is laughing which is the most important thing. He’s fit to travel and very happy, and playing with toys and with his mum, dad and brother.

‘His parents think this treatment is going to be less aggressive for his future and is going to have less negative repercussions in terms of his future intellectual development and his quality of life.

‘We all want the best for him. We want this treatment to work because that’s what his parents have fought for. Like any parent would, they’ve just tried to do the best for their child.’

However, Dr Peter Wilson, lead paediatrician at Southampton General Hospital, has insisted that Ashya’s best chance of survival is conventional radiotherapy.

Dr Wilson, who cared for Ashya in Britain, said the boy’s form of  cancer – called medulloblastoma – was not suitable for proton beam therapy because radiation was needed over a much wider area to kill all the cancerous cells.

Ashya's parents think the pioneering treatment is going to be less aggressive than traditional chemotherapy. Above, Ashya's father Brett and brother Danny wait outside the children's hospital in Malaga on Friday

‘For this particular tumour, the reason why the proton beam was  not deemed to be of any benefit is because you have to irradiate most of the brain and spine,’  he added.

Southampton Hospital staff and Hampshire Police have faced heavy criticism at the way Ashya’s disappearance was handled, with Mr King, 51, saying he and his wife were ‘treated like terrorists’.

An inquiry has been launched by the local safeguarding children board.

A spokesman for the Proton Therapy Centre said last night: ‘We have received the documents and a decision will be made on the boy’s treatment at a meeting of doctors on Monday morning.’
