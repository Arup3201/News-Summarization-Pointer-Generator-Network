Cleveland kidnapping victim Amanda Berry may start a new life near her extended family in Tennessee after escaping the abductor who held her captive for ten years.

Miss Berry, now 27, vanished in Cleveland, Ohio, on the day before her 17th birthday on April 21, 2003, shortly after calling her sister to say she was getting a lift home from her job at Burger King.

But she incredible emerged alive earlier this month when she managed to escape from the basement of a house in Cleveland where she had been sexually abused by her captor and gave birth to her six-year-old daughter.

Facing trial: Ariel Castro is being held in prison facing charges of kidnap and rape after he allegedly held three women captive in his home for a decade

Two other women Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who disappeared from the same block as Ms Berry ten years ago were also rescued from the property.

Ms Berry's relatives now hope she will move to Tennessee so she can be closer to her father and extended family.

Her uncle Curtis Berry, 50, from Elizabethton, Tennessee, told nydailynews.com: 'She has more kin here than anywhere else. This is her home.'

Ms Berry has also been to visit the grave of her mother Louwana Miller, who never gave up hope her daughter was alive, for the first time  since she passed away.

Her alleged abductor Ariel Castro, 52, is currently being held in prison awaiting trial.

His brothers Onil, 50, and Pedro, 54, were arrested May 6 along with their sibling but were later released.

‘I didn’t get to see Michelle because
- she came out so fast … but I was so focused on Gina because she was 
so, she was shaking, she was like, it was sad ... and they were all 
together that's the crazy thing, you know -- and we didn't even know 
what was going on, we just pulled over because we thought we were going 
to get stopped,’ Colon told NewsNet 5.

In an interview in CNN, Pedro Castro said he had no idea what had been going on. He added: 'If I knew, I would have reported it — brother or no brother.'

Ms Berry and her fellow captives only escaped after a neighbour heard Berry calling for help, kicked the door of the house in and gave her a telephone to call 911.

'Help me, I'm Amanda Berry... I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years and I'm here. I'm free now,' she is heard saying in the call to police.

'I need them now before he gets back!' she said in the frantic phone call, going on to identify her captor as Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old Hispanic man.

A brief video filmed by Jasmina Baldrich shows the very first image of Berry after she broke out of the house of horrors after being held captive for a decade.

Berry can be seen clutching her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn in her arms and holding Charles Ramsey’s hand for comfort. Ramsey was later hailed has a hero for responding to Berry’s cries for help and phoning 911.

Cops can be seen prying open the front door of Castro's house. Once open, they flood into the home, some reaching for their handguns.

Baldrich and her friend Ashley Colon were driving down Seymour Avenue on Monday evening when they were suddenly surrounded by police cruisers.

Baldrich thought she was being pulled over. Within second, the officers started running toward a house and breaking down the door.

‘We just seen cops and then out of nowhere all we see Amanda walking by saying I'm Amanda Berry,’ Baldrich told NewsNet 5 in Cleveland.

Baldirch said she and Colon both immediately realized what was happening.

‘We both got goose bumps at the same time.  We were shocked, we could not believe it,’ Colon said.

The revelation that Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were alive and had been kept as sex slaves for a decade shocked and horrified the nation, but it was seen as a miracle in Cleveland.

Berry and DeJesus were both well known missing persons cases. Their disappearance haunted their neighborhood and their parents made public campaigns to search for them and plead for their return.

Berry was nearly 17 when she disappeared in 2003. DeJesus was just 14 when she was taken off a street walking home in 2004. Knight disappeared in 2002, but because she was an adult and because her mother assumed she had run away, her case fell through the cracks.

‘I didn’t get to see Michelle because - she came out so fast … but I was so focused on Gina because she was so, she was shaking, she was like, it was sad ... and they were all together that's the crazy thing, you know -- and we didn't even know what was going on, we just pulled over because we thought we were going to get stopped,’ Colon told NewsNet 5.

Well known: Huge public appeals were launched after Amanda Berry, pictured left aged 15, vanished on her way home after finishing a shift at Burger King

The three women have hired attorneys and a PR firm to represent them as the entire world waits for them to make their first public appearances.

Their lawyer addressed the media on Sunday morning with a brief public statement saying the girls were thankful for the support from the community.

However, they asked for privacy and said they would not give any public interviews until after Castro’s trial.

He is being held on $8million bail on three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping.

The prosecutor said he hopes to add murder charges to Castro’s indictment and pursue the death penalty after he allegedly beat his victims so that they had miscarriages.

A 10-foot chainlink fence now surrounds the house on Seymour and work crews boarded up the windows to protect the home, and any remaining evidence inside, from furious Clevelanders who have threatened to burn it to the ground.
