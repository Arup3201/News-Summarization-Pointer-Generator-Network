The teenage girl who fell 3,500 feet in a skydiving accident has revealed that she only remembers screaming and then blacking out when she realized that there was a problem with her parachute.

Makenzie Wethington, whose injuries included damage to her liver and a kidney, some bleeding in her brain, and a broken pelvis, lumbar spine, shoulder blade and several ribs, spent a about a week in an Oklahoma City hospital before transferring to one in her home state of Texas.

'I remember jumping out of the plane and looking up and seeing that there was a complication with the parachute and so I started kicking my feet like I was taught in the class and I looked up and it still wasn't fixing so I tried to pull the toggles apart,' said Makenzie, who is from the small town of Joshua, said at a news conference at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.

Survivor: Makenzie Wethington said that she blacked out and does not remember anything that happened in the three days after her skydiving accident

Optimistic: Doctors expect the 16-year-old to make a full recovery in spite of the fact that she fell more than 3,500 feet on a parachuting trip just over two weeks ago

'I just was not strong enough to fight off the wind. I just remember screaming and then I blacked out and I don't remember anything after that, for three days after.'

'I know I was scared and I know that there was something very wrong. I think I was focused on how I could fix it and what I could do,' she said, adding, 'I think I went into shock.'

The accident happened on January 25 and doctors already have said that they expect Makenzie  to make a full recovery.

Dr Seema Sikka, who is treating Wethington at Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, noted that the 16-year-old is already walking 'a good amount' with a walker and is regularly in a wheelchair while wearing a neckbrace.

Dr Sikka said she may be released from the hospital in about a week. After that she'll continue to need various outpatient therapies.

'I'm good. I feel good. I'm doing better every day,' Makenzie said.

'I'm very thankful that I can move as well as I can.

Her parents agreed to allow her to skydive as a 16th birthday present, and her father jumped ahead of her.

Makenzie said she had wanted to go skydiving for years and had convinced her parents to let her do it after learning someone could skydive at the age of 16 in Oklahoma with parental consent.

The owner of the skydiving school has said the parachute opened, but Wethington began to spiral downward when the chute went up but not out in some kind of malfunction.

Sticking together: Makenzie begged her parents to allow her to go skydiving for her 16th birthday and as part of the deal her father Joe jumped with her, but his parachute did not malfunction

Positive outcome: Makenzie, seen with her mother Holly at the Thursday press conference, said that the incident has made her want to become a trauma surgeon

The owner maintains that Makenzie and other divers were given instruction beforehand on how to deal with such problems.

She said she wasn't scared as she jumped.

'I remember getting in the plane and feeling that rush of excitement,' she said.

Her father, Joe Wethington, said that when he ran up to her where she'd fallen in a cow pasture, the teenager couldn't catch her breath and had a frightened look on her face.

'Every time she would catch a breath she would just scream and ask me to rub her back,' he said.

Makenzie said she's always wanted to be a surgeon, but her experience after being injured has made her want to focus on being a trauma surgeon.

When asked if she ever wanted to skydive again, she replied: 'As much as I would like to, I think that my parents and the rest of my family would die if I did. They're against that now.'
