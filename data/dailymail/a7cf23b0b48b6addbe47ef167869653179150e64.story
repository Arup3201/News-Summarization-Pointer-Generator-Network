Britain woke up to fog today, as it was revealed the unseasonal warmth will continue into October - with 20C (68F) temperatures expected this week.

But by the weekend it is expected to be much cooler and windier for the country, with wetter conditions forecast into most of next week.

The Met Office had a severe weather warning for fog in place until 10am today, covering most parts of the South East and South West of England.

One of these areas was Norfolk, where a 
Greater Anglia train was pictured battling through the fog outside Acle 
railway station near Norwich today.

Also seen making its way through fog 
in the county this morning was traffic on the A47 and a canal boat on 
the River Thurne in the Norfolk Broads.

Met Office forecaster Laura Young told MailOnline today: ‘Yesterday we had a high of 24.7C (76.5F) at Northolt, which is very warm for this time of year.

'In the South you're looking at 21C (70F) today. It is staying very mild for this time of year. Tomorrow there is a good deal of dry weather.

‘There is a good picture tomorrow, unless you’re in the North West - in which case you have got some showers coming through in the morning. 

‘But it does break up very quickly. Tomorrow there will be highs of about 22C (72F) in London. Scotland’s still looking at maybe even 19C (66F).’

She then looked ahead to the weekend, adding: ‘Friday is still going to remain largely dry in the south, but a bit windier.

‘A narrow band of rain comes through Northern Ireland and north-west Scotland – and it moves south-eastwards.

‘It probably won’t reach the 
South East until mid-morning on Saturday and clear by the afternoon. 
Saturday is more seasonal weather, but it is short lived.

‘On
 Sunday it’s becoming unsettled over most parts - with longer spells of 
rain, particularly in the north - and it’s going to be quite windy.

‘It will be a marked difference to the weekend just gone, but it’s more seasonal – it’s nothing to be worry about.’

Met
 Office forecasts warn of 'periods of wet and windy weather' from 
October 3 to 12, then 'generally unsettled conditions' from October 13 
to 27.

Once the mist and
 fog has cleared it will be a cloudy morning with showery rain in 
places, before this gives way to drier and brighter conditions for many.

Tonight
 will be mostly dry with variable cloud, clear spells and light winds, 
with a chance of showers in the South and a low temperature of 10C 
(50F).

And tomorrow will be mostly dry with sunny spells, and a chance of showers again - although it will feel warm, with a top temperature of 21C (70F).

Wednesday will be cloudy with sunny spells and showers, Thursday will be dry and sunny, while Friday will also be dry but become increasingly breezy.

Yesterday, weather experts at MeteoGroup revealed that Britain is on course for one of its driest ever Septembers.

They said just 0.55in (14mm) of rain fell in England and Wales from September 1 to 27 - 17 per cent of the normal amount for the time of year.

The record low was in 1959 when just 0.31in (8mm) of rain fell in September. The first half of this month was the UK's driest for more than 50 years.

But forecasters said that while the start of October may continue to be dry, conditions are likely to become more unsettled with wind and rain.
