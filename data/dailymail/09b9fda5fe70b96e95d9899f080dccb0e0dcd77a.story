Convicted rapist Ched Evans has been offered an unexpected route back into football by Maltese team Hibernians.

The 26-year-old footballer, who had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United retracted in November after a public outcry, has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012. 

The Maltese Premier League club revealed last night that they had made an offer for Evans to play for the side for the next six months.

Club vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill.

'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' 

Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close.

'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.'

He added: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.'

Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Mr Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.'

In November, television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team.

Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk.

The Maltese club said they had 'no problem' signing Evans and that the Wales international deserved a second chance

Sheffield United then retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction. 

Tranmere Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Hartlepool United have all also rejected the opportunity to sign the Wales international.

However, Malta's Hibernians, who are top of the country's domestic league and play in the town od Paola, believe there would be no such reaction in Malta.

'We have no problem with that,' Mr Farrugia said. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football.

'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.'

He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.'  

Mr Farrugia added: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football.

'(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.'

Scottish Championship side Hibernian took to Twitter to ease fans' fears that they had made an offer to Evans, posting: 'Just to clarify we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you in the morn, HFC'. 

Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011.
