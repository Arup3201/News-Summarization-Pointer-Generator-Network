A headmistress has set a new world record after she asked 57 of her pupils to act as groomsmen for her wedding.

Kaycie and Jim Blaylock tied the knot at St John Catholic Church in Panama City surrounded by a hoard of smiling boys, aged between five and 13.

The News Herald of Panama City reported that Mr Blaylock saw a story about a woman attempting to break the Guinness World Record for most bridesmaids - which is 96. So, she went for the record number of groomsmen.

The record of 47 had belonged to Arulanantham Suresh Joachim, a Tamil-Canadian entertainer who has broken 60 world records.

To challenge the world record, the Blaylocks are in the process of submitting an application to Guinness. Mrs Blaylock said she'll have to provide signatures of each of the groomsman, a marriage certificate and a photo.

'This is why we wanted to do it this way - we wanted to share it with the kids,' the bride said. 'That's the soundtrack to my life and now Jim's life - it's the children, their laughter and making them laugh.'

The groom was yesterday still trying to grasp the extra-large wedding party.

Bouquet: After the ceremony, the groomsmen locked arms with the bridesmaids and followed the happily married couple out of the sanctuary before she tossed her bouquet for a gaggle of pupils

'It's all just overwhelming. It's too much to take in,' he said. 'I'm just really happy to be married to her.'

'We're glad we did it this way,' the bride said. 'It was a lot of fun.'

Love: The 80 bridesmaids (and a couple of page boys) form the shape of a heart for the wedding of Katie Dalby and Norman Gooch

Their wedding comes after British dance teacher Katie Dalby, 26, came close the world record for the most bridesmaids when she invited 80 of her pupils to follow her down the aisle when she married fireman Norman Gooch, 37, in Harwich, Essex, in August.

The bridesmaids and page boys included all pupils from Katie's Boogie Shoes Dance Academy, three sisters-in-law, a niece, a cousin and her best friend.
