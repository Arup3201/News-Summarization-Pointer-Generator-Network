The tiny Tasmanian town of Ross may only have 272 residents, but more than 50 Japanese tourists rush to their bakery every single day.

Incredibly, the Ross Village Inn Bakery in rural Tasmania is a favourite tourist destination for anime enthusiasts has an uncanny resemblance to the setting in a beloved cult film.

Fans of 1989 anime film 'Kiki's Delivery Service' flock to the bakery, astounded by the likeliness that the café, established in 1860, bears to 'Gütiokipänja Bakery, the famous fictional setting in the film.

The urban myth claims that the animators of the film visited the tiny town and drew their inspiration from the bakery, recreating it in their animated movie as the home and workplace of their heroine, 13-year-old Kiki.

More than 50 anime fans, particularly Japanese tourists, visit the bakery every day, many dressed as Kiki

The Japanese fantasy film tells the story of a young witch Kiki who accepts a job delivering goods by broomstick for a bakery owner.

'Welcome. Yes, this is the Original Ross Bakery (cica 1860)…' a sign on the bakery's door reads.

'Many believe it was here that Hayao Miyazaki drew inspiration for Majo no Takkyubkin (Kiki's Delivery Service.

'We don't know if this is true. What do you believe?'

However, the animators of the film reportedly insist they have never been to Tasmania, meaning the near-perfect resemblance between the two bakeries may just be an incredible coincidence.

Ross bakery co-owner Carl Crosby says the attention is staggering and persistent. 

Business is booming, a wonderful feat considering the bakery is located in a small town in the centre of Tasmania with a population of less than 300.

'Sometimes we're just too busy to let them see the room or too busy to let them see the oven,' Mr Crosby told ABC. 

As the bakery's popularity grew, the owners decided to make the most of the opportunity and makeover the attic bedroom in the building.

To the delight of fans, the tiny bedroom has been converted into a replica of Kiki's bedroom, which was also located above the bakery in the film.

'My partner's mum put it together a few years ago just because there was so many people coming and asking, 'where's the room?',' Mr Crosby told ABC. 

The authentic woodfire oven is very exciting for fans who visit as it is identical to the one which features in the film and is in the perfect position

Many of the fans who are interested in 'cosplay' even arrive in a 'Kiki' costume, eager to hire the room for $85 a night and pretend they are their favourite character for a day.

'Some of them will come in their little costumes, with their bow in their hair and their little red shoes, and they want to stand in front of the oven and take a multitude of pictures,' Mr Crosby told news.com.au.

The room even provides a 'TV/VCR to watch Kiki videos'.

Kiki's room is frequently booked out for weeks at a time but every time the reaction is hysterical according to the owner, with screaming, giggling and jumping around.

University of Tasmania lecturer Dr Craig Norris has studied the astonishing reaction people have to the bakery and believe, for fans, the authenticity is part of the bakery's charm

Excited fans record their experiences in a guest book, drawing pictures and gushing about their stay in 'Kiki's room'.

The bakery did not seek attention or design the bakery as a replica of the setting in 'Kiki's Delivery Service' – rather, the bakery was created as it stands today more than 120 years before the film.

'It was something that very much began organically, grassroots, bottom down from the fan community itself, it's nothing that the bakery staff themselves top down managed,' Dr Norris told ABC.
