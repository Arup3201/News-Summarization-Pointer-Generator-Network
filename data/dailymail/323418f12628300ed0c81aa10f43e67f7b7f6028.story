With stunning views and a beachfront location, it is widely considered the best finishing hole in golf.

But today, Pebble Beach's iconic 18th hole looks a bit different from usual after a ferocious storm uprooted one of the two Cypress trees dotting the fairway.

The trees, which were planted near the landing area in 2004 in the place of another pair of diseased trees, play into the strategy of the tee shot at the hole in the California coastal resort.

Speaking of the uprooting, United States Golf Association (USGA) official Ron Read said: 'I was standing on the 18th tee and conservatively, the wind was blowing at least 40 miles an hour.'

He added that despite taking a photo of the fairway during the winter storm, he did not notice the downed tree until he examined the picture later,Golf Digest reported. 

Following the incident on Thursday, only one Cypress tree still sits on the fairway, around 300 yards from the championship tees, that would continue to affect players' strategies.

However, it is possible that officials may not be able to find and plant a replacement tree in time for the PGA Tour's annual stop at the site as part of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.

The competition is due to be played from February 12 to 15, 2015.

The tree is the third to fall on a golf course in 2014. Earlier this year, the Eisenhower Tree on the 17th hole at Augusta National was completely damaged in an ice storm in February.

Meanwhile, an overhanging tree at the sixth hole at TPC Sawgrass, was cut down in October.
