Michigan police botched an investigation into a mother's death and wrongly concluded that she had committed suicide, her devastated daughter has claimed.

Michelle Romain says she has evidence to prove that her mother, JoAnn Matouk Romain, 55, was actually 
murdered before her dead body was found floating in a river in Ontario in 2010.

She believes that her 
mother was abducted outside a church where she was going to an evening Mass, chloroformed and left in the 
water near Belle Isle in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press reported.

She said cops in Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Woods made mistakes throughout the investigation and is now urging them to re-open the investigation - but so far they have not.

Determined: Michelle Romain is urging police to re-open the investigation into her mother's death, which they ruled as a suicide. She claims that evidence reveals that her mother was in fact murdered

Together: Michelle Romain, left, said her mother JoAnn, right, would never have killed herself

'My mother was murdered, pure and 
simple,' she insisted in a press release. 'And I will never be at peace nor will other members of my 
family, until this matter is properly investigated and her killer or 
killers are brought to justice.'

The battle comes exactly four years after JoAnn Romain, who had said she was concerned she was being followed, vanished after she attended an evening Mass at St Paul Catholic Church.

Two months later, her body was found in the Detroit River near Amherstburg, more than 50 miles from the church.

Investigators in Grosse Pointe Farms suggested that she had walked from her car and climbed over rocks to Lake St Clair, where she drowned. The investigation was then handed over to police officers in Grosse Pointe Woods, where Romain had lived.

But Michelle Romain refused to 
believe that her mother would have ever killed herself and has since 
spent nearly $200,000 hiring her own lawyers and investigators to find 
out the truth.

She said she
 believes her mother was killed because someone had a vendetta against 
one of her uncles, to whom her mother was close, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Questions: JoAnn's SUV was filled with gas before she went to church - which her daughter believes she would not have done if she was planning on killing herself later that night

Tragic scene: Two months after she vanished in 2010, her body was found in the Detroit River

Three pathologists ruled the cause of death as drowning but the manner of death as undetermined.

Missed: JoAnn's daughter believes she was kidnapped by the church and dumped in the river

Attorneys filed lawsuits to get the records of the case and a retired FBI investigator gathered witness statements from the scene.

They claim that JoAnn filled up her car with petrol before going to the church service - which she would have been unlikely to do if she knew she was going to kill herself.

JoAnn's boots were also immaculate - apart from dirt - suggesting that she did not climb over the rocks to reach the water, and suggesting her body was carried and dumped, they say.

They add that her purse was torn and that her body had bruising on the shoulder she carried it.

A lead recovery diver who searched for her body told the team there was no current at the time she is believed to have waded into the water, making it impossible for her body to have drifted so far.

Michelle Romain claims that police officers told her footprints led from
 the vehicle to the water - but they later recanted this after realizing
 the ground was dry.

She 
added that they also failed to pursue claims by witnesses that they saw a
 man wearing black clothing and a black scarf along the edge of the 
water that night.

Family: The Romains have asked police in Michigan to re-open the case - but so far they have not

Her private investigator, Scott Lewis, said at a press conference last Wednesday that after reviewing evidence, he also believes JoAnn Romain was murdered.

'I am convinced that JoAnn Romain did not commit suicide,' he said. 'I think this was a murder.'

But the police have so far not agreed to re-open the investigation.

Grosse 
Pointe Farms Public Safety Lt. Rich Rosati told the Detroit Free Press 
that none of the information presented by Romain and her investigator is enough to re-open the case.

'From the police perspective, it does seem to us, 
by all the evidence we have seen and what our experience has taught us, 
itâ€™s a suicide,' he said.
