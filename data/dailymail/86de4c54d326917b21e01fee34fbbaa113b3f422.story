THERESA CHEUNG, author of The Dream Dictionary From A To Z, deciphers the secrets of your sleeping mind. This week, U is for ...

UFO: These suggest personal growth. As awareness of the infinity can be overwhelming, your dreaming mind may express it as alien contact. You should consider what changes are occurring in the way you relate to people and events to help decipher it.

Dreaming of UFOs suggests personal growth - consider what changes are occurring in your life

Dreaming of an umbrella suggests you need protecting, while dreams about university suggest a thirst for knowledge

UGLY: These dreams suggest anxiety about what others think of you. The central question to your interpretation should be whether you feel you are ugly in waking life - or if something makes you feel that way.

Perhaps your feeling is to do with a physical change, such as becoming pregnant, or a shift in moral behaviour, such as trying something you once might not have considered.

How we feel about our bodies is a serious part of how we feel about ourselves. If you have recurring dreams of personal ugliness, consider counselling for self-esteem or eating disorders.

UMBRELLA: These are protective accessories, so if you use one in your dream, do you feel deluged in waking life - and do you need to find shelter?

Rain shares water's symbolic association with emotion, so if rain pours in your dream, are you being battered by a stream of your own emotions, or those belonging to someone else?

UNIVERSITY: Symbolises a hunger for knowledge. Learn something new.

Dreams about ugliness suggest anxiety about what others think of you - the central question to your interpretation should be whether you feel you are ugly in waking life - or if something makes you feel that way
