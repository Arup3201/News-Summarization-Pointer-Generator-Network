A popular and 'edgy' high-street retailer is facing a backlash as parents discovered a Christmas brochure full of f-bombs and other unseasonal greetings.

Urban Outfitters, which targets teenagers with lifestyle products, has been accused of seeking attention through the use of profanity in the past.

And this year's catalog features books, mugs and other gifts emblazoned with swearwords.

'Offensive': Parents are upset that products such as this one are being targeted at their teenage children

The 2012 Christmas range includes a $24 candle proclaiming F**k, a parody of the classic Love sculpture by American artist Robert Indiana.

There is a book entitled 'Let’s f***ing reminisce' and a 'It was all f***ing awesome' photo album.

The festive catalog contains a mug and wrapping paper stating Merry Christmas b*****s.

Also available are several gifts and clothing items with the F-word.

Unseasonal greetings: The message on this mug is not very festive

This wrapping paper has the same attitude

Urban Outfitters are hoping that their target audience of teenagers and 20-somethings find the sweary items 'cool' - it certainly isn't the first time the retailer has featured obscene products.

The store stocked T-shirts featuring Mitt Romney and the phrase 'Mitt is the s**t' earlier in the year.

Monica Cole, director of the American Family Association’s One Million Moms division told Fox News: 'This really isn’t anything new for 
them.'

'Their catalog has offensive profanities on products 
and little knickknacks, T-shirts -- you name it. And so many teenagers 
shop there.'

Parody: This candle is inspired by the classic Love sculpture

F-bombing: A T-shirt available at Urban Outfitters

Cole said the
company 'consistently' uses profane language and that the AFA have 
complained to the 'offensive' retailer on previous occasions.

The AFA have once again requested that Urban Outfitters 'clean up' their website and catalog.

No one at Urban Outfitters was available for comment.

The advantages of a rude and controversial range are obvious.

As Loyola University business professor Joan Phillips, Ph.D. told CBS2: 'It’s a classic segmentation approach.'

'Urban outfitters has had one controversial issue a year for about 10 years,' Phillips said.

'It gets people talking and we’re talking.'
