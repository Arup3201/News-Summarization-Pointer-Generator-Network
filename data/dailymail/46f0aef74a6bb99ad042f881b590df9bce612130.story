Barack Obama jokily side-stepped a question about the GOP presidential candidates from Tonight Show host Jay Leno today.

Leno had tried to get the President to talk about the Republican race, but all Mr Obama offered was a gag referencing television's Survivor programme.

'I'm going to wait until everybody is voted off the island,' Mr Obama said of the Republicans, provoking much laughter in the crowd at the studio in Burbank, California.

Waiting game: President Barack Obama, pictured during an interview on the 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno' at the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, today, said he would not comment on GOP nominees

Cosy: Mr Obama got close to NBC producer Michelle Tasoff during the interview, where he joked he would wait until the Republican candidates had been voted off the island

Crying game: The President did not get the warmest of reactions from all those at San Francisco International Airport after recording the Tonight Show with Leno

'Once they narrow it down to one or 
two, I'll start paying attention,' he added, according to clips of the 
interview released by NBC.

Mr Obama also discussed the toxic 
political environment in Washington DC, telling Leno that: 'I think the 
things that folks across the country are most fed up with  - whether you
are a Democrat, Republican, Independent - is putting party ahead of 
country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation.'

The Tonight Show interview of Mr Obama airs in its entirety at 11.30pm ET.

Mr Obama also discussed the fall and death of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

'Well, this is somebody who, for 40 years, has terrorized his country and supported terrorism,' Mr Obama said.

'And he had an opportunity during the
Arab spring to finally let loose of his grip on power and to peacefully
transition into democracy. We gave him ample opportunity, and he 
wouldn't do it.

Latino event: Antonio Banderas hosted the fundraising dinner at the LA home he shares with his wife Melanie Griffith, where Eva Longoria told the crowd Mr Obama 'speaks to the Latino community'

Common touch: Before attending the functions, President Obama made an impromptu stop at Roscoe's chicken diner

Loud applause: When the President vowed to tackle an overhaul on immigration laws the crowd, including comedian George Lopez and host Melanie Griffith, cheered

As for Gaddafi's shocking killing, Mr
Obama said: 'Obviously, you never like to see anybody come to the kind 
of end that he did, but I think it obviously sends a strong message 
around the world to dictators that people long to be free, and they need
to respect the human rights and the universal aspirations of people.'

After the taping, Mr Obama headed to San Francisco for a Democratic campaign fundraiser.

He was warmly welcomed at San 
Francisco International Airport by all apart from one baby, who despite 
the President's best hug, would not stop crying.

Mr Obama arrived at the Today Show 
having spoken to a star-studded crowd at the Los Angeles mansion of 
Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith as part of the first ever Latino 
fundraiser to support his candidacy.

Guests paid between $5,000 and 
$35,800 to attend yesterday evening's canapé event, where actress Eva 
Longoria introduced the President and said: 'We applaud you from our 
community; we thank you for everything you're doing.'

In
one of his busiest donor outreach trips of the season Mr Obama also 
went to film producer James Lassiter's LA home to adress an intimate 
dinner crowd, which included actor Will Smith and basketball legend 
Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.

The gatherings were part of a three-day,
cash-generating trip through Nevada, Colorado and California, the 
latter being Mr Obama's biggest donor state.

Another stop: Mr Obama earlier attended a fundraising dinner at film producer James Lassiter's Hancock Park home, where he spoke to a crowd of 40

Jokes: Will Smith, left, and Magic Johnson, right, were at Lassiter's house, where the President joked his bills could save billions so Americans can buy tickets to Smith's films and products from Johnson's business

Fascinated: Hilary Duff was at the first function and later tweeted: 'Wow just had the most interesting dinner'

He raised about $1 million 
in the Los Angeles area alone during the past two fundraising quarters, 
according to the Associated Press.

At Banderas' and Griffith's house, its entrance path lined with rose 
petals and votive candles, Mr Obama told about 120 mostly Latino 
contributors that he has kept a list of his campaign promises and that, 
by his count, he has accomplished about 60 per cent of them.

'I'm pretty confident we can get the other 40 per cent done in the next five years,' he said to loud applause.

The Griffith-Banderas event was the first Latino fundraiser for Obama's 
candidacy, with donors giving at least $5,000 per person to attend.

Alongside Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria was comedian George 
Lopez, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, and mayors Antonio Villaraigosa of 
Los Angeles and Julian Castro of San Antonio.

The President drew the loudest applause when he vowed to tackle an 
overhaul of immigration laws, a promise from 2008 that has gone 
unfulfilled in the face of Republican opposition.

Introducing Mr Obama, co-host Longoria told the group that he 'speaks to
the Latino community because he knows he's the President of all 
Americans.

'And we applaud you from our community; we thank you for everything you’re doing.'

There was a smaller crowd of about 40 present at Lassiter's home, which he shares with his wife, Mai.

Hollywood star Smith, in an elegant three-piece suit, Magic Johnson, the
standout former point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers, and actress 
Hilary Duff, each contributed $35,800 for the cozy dinner and a chance 
to chat with the President.

Mr Obama indulged in name-dropping during his speech, joking that his 
mortgage refinancing plan 'could free up billions of dollars for 
American consumers who can then shop and go to Will's movies and spend 
money at whatever business Magic has and could help grow the economy 
overall.'

Mr Obama, eager to reinvigorate his supporters, ticked off his administration's accomplishments.

'Sometimes I think people forget how much has gotten done,' the 
President said as he urged his backers to rally once again, at the same 
time joking, as he often does, that he is older and greyer now.

'This election won't be as sexy as the first one. Back then it was still fresh and new.

'I didn't have any grey hair. Everybody loved the 'Hope' posters and all
that. This time, we've got to grind it out a little bit.

Doing it for the kids: Obama poses for a picture with some young diners

Pressing the flesh: Customers seemed delighted that the president had stopped by to pick up a snack

'We've got to grind it out. But the cause is the same. And my passion is the same. And my commitment is the same.'

Singer-actress Duff tweeted afterwards: 'Wow just had the most interesting dinner with about 20 couples and @BarackObama !!Always fascinating to talk to such influential people!'

Others at Lassiter’s Hancock Park home included Troy Carter, the manager
of Grammy award winner Lady Gaga. The singer herself was a guest at a 
fundraiser last month at the Atherton home of Facebook chief operating 
officer Sheryl Sandberg.

Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Mr Obama headed to a diverse neighbourhood
minutes from Lassiter's home south of Hollywood and stopped at 
Roscoe's, a popular Los Angeles chicken restaurant chain.

Displaying a campaign-style vigour, Mr
Obama roved through the dining booths greeting customers, leaving at 
least one awestruck young boy holding his hand aloft after shaking the 
President's hand.

One man gave him a hug and a Hispanic man told his daughter that if she studied hard 'you'll be like him.'

Most of the President's remaining time during this three-day Western swing is being spent raising money.
