Rotherham's crime tsar quit the Labour Party last night following a day of calls for him to resign from his £85,000-a-year post in the wake of the child exploitation scandal.

Shaun Wright pre-empted attempts to sack him by resigning from the party – but vowed to remain in his role as an independent Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire.

He shrugged off any blame for the scandal, despite having been the Labour councillor responsible for children’s services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by Asian men was at its worst.

Rotherham's crime tsar Shaun Wright was yesterday urged to quit his £85,000-a-year post by his own party over the child exploitation scandal

In a statement on his website, he wrote: ‘I entered into public service over 20 years ago to make a positive difference.

‘Protecting vulnerable people has been my number one priority as Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire.

‘I
 have had to make the difficult decision to stand down from the Labour 
Party and it’s with deep regret that I’ve come to that decision.’

Mr
 Wright sparked incredulity yesterday by claiming the damning report 
highlighting the abuse of at least 1,400 girls over 16 years came as ‘a 
huge surprise’.

In an astonishing interview, he said: ‘I don’t think any of this was my direct fault.’

Earlier, Labour had warned it would suspend him from the party if he had not resigned by this morning.

Mr Wright insisted he had taken action to prevent the sickening attacks
 and was ‘proud of the progress South Yorkshire Police has made’ – even 
though it has brought few abusers to justice.

He
 went on to claim he had not received the three key official reports 
that described growing child sexual exploitation in Rotherham.

Mr Wright shrugged off any blame for the scandal, despite having been the Labour councillor responsible for children's services in the town from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by Asian men was at its worst

Asked by Sky News whether he had seen them, he said: ‘It was not escalated to senior management level.

‘I didn’t see any of the reports in 2002 or 2003. The report in 2006 didn’t come to me.’

But
 the investigation into the scandal, commissioned by the council from 
Professor Alexis Jay, says he received a report entitled Protection Of 
Young People From Sexual Assault In Rotherham in June 2007.

He also received two further reports on sexual exploitation in 2008 and a further one in 2009, according to Professor Jay.

She
 said that when he took over responsibility for the protection of 
vulnerable young people in 2005, councillors and senior officials at the
 authority were fully aware of the sexual exploitation in the town.Seminars for senior managers at the council presented the abuse ‘in the most explicit terms’, Professor Jay added.

He claimed he had not seen the previous three official reports, published in 2002, 2003 and 2006, which described growing child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. But the investigation into the scandal, commissioned by the council from Professor Alexis Jay, says he received a report

After
 council leader Roger Stone quit on Tuesday, senior Labour and Tory 
politicians yesterday called on Mr Wright to resign, too. A Labour Party
 spokesman said: ‘The report into child abuse in Rotherham was 
devastating in its findings.

‘Vulnerable
 children were repeatedly abused and then let down. In the light of this
 report, it is appropriate that South Yorkshire police and crime 
commissioner Shaun Wright should step down.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed 
Balls, who was children’s secretary in the last Labour government, 
admitted the party could not force Mr Wright to quit.

He
 told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘The Labour Party has no power to 
compel somebody who has been elected as a police and crime commissioner 
to stand down.

‘But it is absolutely our view that he should do so.

That
 is something which has been communicated to him today. We need to show 
that we, not just in Rotherham but across the country, can command 
public confidence to keep children safe.

‘Lessons
 have got to be learned. But when you have a failure of this magnitude 
and catastrophe, people have to take responsibility.'

Shadow
 Home Secretary Yvette Cooper added: ‘We have said we think the police 
and crime commissioner should stand down, just as the leader of the 
council has done, because 1,400 children were abused  and they were let 
down badly by the authorities.’

Home
 Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Shaun Wright obviously has had involvement
 in this, both as his role as a councillor and obviously he’s now the 
police and crime commissioner.

‘It’s
 not my job as Home Secretary to hire and fire police and crime 
commissioners ... I believe he has real questions to answer and I think 
in the circumstances he should heed those calls.’  

During
 a series of interviews with broadcasters yesterday, Mr Wright said he 
quit his role on Rotherham Council in 2010 when the scale of sexual 
abuse began to emerge. He said there was no need for him to resign again
 over the same issue.

Mr 
Wright said: ‘I take my share of the responsibility. There was systemic 
failure and I only wish that I knew more at the time.

‘If
 I knew then what I know now, then clearly more could have been done. I 
think I took appropriate actions where that was available. I’m 
completely astonished by the scale of the issue that has been 
identified.

‘I’m just as disgusted as any other right-thinking person in Rotherham and across the country to the scale of this problem.

'I
 have sought to do everything in my power during any role that I have 
held, both as a council cabinet member and now as South Yorkshire PCC to
 make that difference and to protect and safeguard more children.’

Mr
 Wright, who lives in Rotherham, wrote about himself on his website: 
‘People who know me describe me as a man of integrity with a strong 
track record in championing ordinary people.’ He also promised to ‘protect the most vulnerable in our society’.

Denis Macshane said he did not look further into 
the town's child abuse sex scandal because he is a 'true Guardian reader
 and liberal leftie' and 'did not want to rock the multi-cultural boat'

Political correctness stopped left-wing politicians and council officials from doing more to expose the abuse scandal, Rotherham’s former MP said yesterday.

Denis MacShane accepted he should have done more but said his own ‘liberal leftie’ background made him reluctant to speak out over abuse allegations against Muslim men.

The shamed former Labour politician, who was jailed over the expenses scandal and is no longer a member of the party, said: ‘I should have burrowed into this. Perhaps, yes, as a true Guardian reader and a liberal leftie I suppose, I didn’t want to raise that too hard.’

Mr MacShane blamed a ‘culture of not wanting to rock the multi-cultural unity boat’ for the failure by numerous agencies and individuals to expose the child exploitation.

He has previously admitted that he, like other politicians, had feared losing Muslim votes if he aired ‘the dirty secrets about bad practices in the Kashmiri Muslim community’.

The damning report into the scandal said council staff feared they would be branded racist if they discussed the allegations with the Pakistani community – even though the victims had described the majority of the men involved as Asian.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, yesterday said it could ‘definitely not’ have been considered racist to investigate the abuse.

Muhbeen Hussain, founder of British Muslim Youth, told the BBC the ethnicity of the majority of the abusers did not mean the scandal should have been kept quiet.

Children’s Commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson said she considered it racist for the issue not to have been raised within the community. She told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘It’s actually racist for anybody to consider that – were you to approach that community – it wouldn’t take seriously what you were raising.’

Mr MacShane, who was jailed for six months after he admitted submitting fake invoices in his expenses, told World At One the abuse was never raised with him personally in his 18 years as Rotherham MP from 1994 to 2012. He admitted he was aware of the allegations from Press reports.

In his book Prison Diaries, published earlier this year after his release from Brixton, Mr MacShane said he was one of many politicians who chose not to speak out about ‘dirty secrets’ because of the fear of losing Muslim votes.

He wrote: ‘I feel ashamed that I too, like so many MPs, preferred to keep silent on some of the dirty secrets about bad practices in the Kashmiri Muslim community.’

Claims were made last night that some Labour councillors may have turned a blind eye to child sex abuse because they needed the Asian vote.

Former Labour sources described a culture where councillors acted as ‘Mafia bosses’ and told their constituents that they could ‘do anything for them’ to keep them on side.

They told the Mail: ‘Rotherham Council is horrendously corrupt. There is a large Asian contingency and a strong Labour vote among the ethnic community so they may have turned a blind eye to things to keep their votes.’
