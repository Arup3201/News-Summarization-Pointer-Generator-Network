Organ traffickers gouged out the eyes of a six-year-old boy to sell on China’s transplant black market, it was claimed yesterday.

Police said the child, Binbin, was drugged after being kidnapped while playing outside his home.

His family found him covered in blood and crying in pain three to four hours later. His eyes were found nearby with the corneas missing, police say, implying that an organ trafficker was behind the attack.

An entire eye cannot be transplanted, but a cornea could be vital for a patient with faltering vision.

Police are seeking a woman suspect and have offered £10,500 for information leading to an arrest.

About 300,000 patients in China need 
transplants each year, but only about 10,000 people can get them due to a
 lack of donors, state media said.

Few Chinese agree to donate their organs after death, fuelling the rampant illegal market activity.

Child organs are 
usually more expensive on the black market, an organ trafficker told 
Sina Internet news portal in 2010, as 'most people think the younger the
 donor is, the better the quality of organs'.

Seven
 people were jailed last year when a teenager sold a kidney for an 
illicit transplant operation and used the proceeds to buy an iPhone and 
iPad.

Binbin’s
 devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we 
discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had 
fallen down and smashed his face.’

The
 boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes 
had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, 
and his eyeballs were not there.’

Illegal
 organ harvesting is booming in China, where there is a shortage of 
donors, and last night, amid domestic and international outrage, Beijing
 was urged to crack down on the country’s multi-million-pound transplant
 industry.

Binbin was shown 
on state TV  being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a 
hospital bed, writhing in agony as his shocked family wept.

China Central Television said he had been drugged and ‘lost consciousness’ before the attacker removed his eyes.

His parents discovered he was missing when they called for him to come in around 8pm on Monday but received no response.

Mortified: Relatives of the youngster talk to a nurse. His parents realised he was missing when they tried to call hm inside the house but received no response

'Extraordinarily vicious': The child's eyes were found nearby but the corneas were missing, reports said, implying that an organ trafficker was behind the harrowing attack

After
 a frantic search with relatives, they found him screaming in a field 
near their home in Fenxi, north China. The kidnapper had reportedly told
 Binbin: ‘Don’t cry and I won’t gouge out your eyes.’

The organ trafficker may have been motivated by money.

But they could also have been driven to such a horrific crime by the hope of saving someone's sight - or even their own.

Problems
 with the cornea - the clear front part of the eye - can cause the eye 
to mist up and, if left untreated, lead to blindness.

But
 the most serious conditions such as Fuchs' dystrophy, a degenerative 
condition that affects older people, can be cured with a transplant, above (file picture).

Until
 recent years, the only operation was a full cornea transplant, an 
operation that involved 24 stitches in each eye and an 18-month recovery
 period.

But advances in 
technology have meant surgeons can now carry out a partial replacement 
under local anaesthetic with a recovery time of just four weeks.

China
 does not have a donor culture, but about 300,000 patients need 
transplants each year. Only about 10,000 receive organs, mainly taken 
from death-row prisoners.

Though
 the sale and transplant of organs for money is prohibited, lax laws and
 widespread corruption have fuelled a booming industry.

China is also a leading destination for ‘transplant tourists’ who travel there to obtain organs.

Last night international doctors appalled by Binbin’s suffering called 
on leading medical journals to ban publication of Chinese research 
papers on organ transplants, to shame the country into tackling the 
problem.

Professor Arthur 
Caplan, head of medical ethics at New York University and spokesman for 
Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, said: ‘As unimaginable and 
untrue as this boy’s torment sounds, it shocks but does not surprise.

‘Whereas
 hearts, livers and kidneys must be sourced from donors who match the 
same blood and body type of recipient patients, in-demand corneas for 
corrective eyesight operations can be taken from any age and body type.

‘Anyone
 who knows where the corneas are located in the eye can extract them, 
and I fear for the unsterile conditions and the  barbaric methods used, 
and that infection may add to the boy’s suffering.

‘He will suffer unthinkable physical and psychological pain.’

Professor
 Caplan urged international governments to ‘stand up to China’ and take 
action to make it clean up its transplant industry.

‘Transplant
 tourists who travel to China with the right amount of money can order 
the organ needed,’ he said. ‘A prisoner is found to match the recipient 
and is taken out and shot.’

Last weekend, Chinese police detained members of a kidney- trafficking ring, including a team of four doctors and nurses.
