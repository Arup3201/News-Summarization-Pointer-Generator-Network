Jailed: Christopher Mancini, 19, was sentenced for a series of attack on 13 boys who he groomed with threats and bribes

A ‘young but predatory’ child abuser convicted of 49 sexual offences against young boys, was jailed for 18 years on Friday.

Christopher Mancini will spend a decade in custody and was banned from contact with children and from using the internet after he was sentenced for the attacks on 13 boys.

Police have urged anyone with information about possible further offences by Mancini to come forward.

He had been convicted of 34 sexual offences - including 24 of causing or inciting sexual activity, five of sexual assault, four of making indecent images of children and one of rape - following an earlier trial.

Mancini, 19, of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, had also pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court to 15 offences of sexual activity with a child, involving three boys, one of whom was one of the 10 boys who gave evidence at the trial.

Six of the offences took place online involving three boys in other areas of the UK.

All the other sexual activity offences took place in Mid-Sussex involving boys known to Mancini.

He was found not guilty of one offence of rape.

Sentencing Mancini yesterday Judge Richard Hayward said the teenager operated using a 'combination of bribes and threats'.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave 
Wardley-Wilkins, of Sussex Police, said: ‘Mancini operated by targeting 
often vulnerable young boys in the area where he lived, whilst he 
himself was aged between 14 and 18.

'Once we received the information in 2012, our enquiries revealed further offending, resulting in the charges and Mancini's conviction and sentencing.

‘The dedicated work of Detective Constable Rebecca Wilde in particular, over many months, was key in enabling us to bring this young but predatory offender to justice.

‘During her very thorough investigation no other current evidence emerged to justify further proceedings against Mancini at this time.

'However anyone who has further information or any other concerns which they feel should be looked into, can contact us.’
