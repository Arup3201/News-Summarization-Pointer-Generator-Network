Juventus have secured a slender advantage to take to Dortmund for the second leg after a hard-fought 2-1 win against Jurgen Klopp's win.

The visitors bossed the first half but goals from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata sandwiched between a goal from Marco Reus, means Juve have the advantage.

89min: Carlos Tevez receives a standing ovation as he is replaced by 18-year-old Coman for his Champions League debut.

86min: Vidal is replaced by versatile Italian Padoin.

85min: Substitute Pereyra drags his shot wide - but he really should have put this game out of Dortmund's reach. Excellent build-up play from Marchisio and then Morata results in the 24-year-old finding space in the area, but his left-footed shot doesn't find the net.

80min: Pereyra is cautioned for a late challenge on Mkhitaryan.

77min: Tevez goes close again with a right-footed strike from close range, as Weidenfeller parries the ball out for a corner.

75min: Immobile won't be scoring against his former side tonight as he makes way for Blaszczykowski.

Paul Pogba has been a joy to watch yet again - the midfielder will surely attract Premier League interest this summer after yet another impressive campaign to date.

This heatmap from our excellent match zone service shows just how much the 21-year-old has commanded play in the middle - while also helping his side attack on the front foot.

Pogba has also registered a second assist in as many European appearances, including the assist for Morata's goal against Dortmund here tonight.

62min: Juve go close to adding a third goal of the evening as Tevez hits a thunderous half-volley in the area after Lichtsteiner's cross from the right found the Argentine inside the box.

55min: Immobile goes close again for Dortmund, getting hold of the ball inside the area, but can only fire his shot straight at Buffon. A good chance goes begging for the visitors.

53min: Marchisio's corner causes mayhem in the Dortmund area. Weidenfeller gets extremely lucky there as he grasps the ball gratefully to his chest. 

49min: Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal is penalised for a late challenge on Marco Reus.

45min: Kirch for Papastathopoulos

Juventus lead here at half-time by two goals to one, but Jurgen Klopp will be shaking his head wondering how they are losing this one. There's a long way to go though and the Dortmund manager will take plenty of encouragement from that first-half display

43min: Goalscorer Tevez is involved in the build-up teeing the ball up for Pogba, whose cross across goal finds Morata, and the 22-year-old makes no mistake from close range. It's harsh on Dortmund who have been the better side.

36min: Pereyra on for Pirlo - The veteran midfielder has picked up a knock and has also been forced off. A real shame. Will be interesting to see how Juventus recover from this.

32min: Ginter on for Piszczek - The 29-year-old has had to come off after failing to recover from a few knocks he's received in this game. A huge blow for the visitors midway through this first half.

18min: An instant response from the visitors as Reus punishes a mix-up at the back between Juve pair Chiellini and Lichtsteiner to calmly roll the ball home past Buffon. What a start to this game!

GOAL! JUVENTUS 1-0 Borussia Dortmund

13min: Tevez nets his fourth goal in the Champions League this season and 20th in all competitions, as he taps home from close range after suspect goalkeeping from Weidenfeller in the Dortmund goal after Morata's shot was initially blocked.

10min: Dortmund are beginning to settle into the game now after Juventus looked to be firmly in the ascendancy in the opening stages. There'll be goals in this game, mark my words.

1min: Immobile nearly gives the visitors a dream start after just a minute. The 25-year-old's rasping right-footed effort from just outside the area goes inches over the bar with Buffon rooted to his spot.

Juventus kick us off from left to right as the Serie A leaders look to maintain their sensational 46-match unbeaten home run.

We are just minutes away from kick-off here at the Juventus Stadium. Serie A leaders Juventus will be hoping to take a lead into the second leg in Germany, with Jurgen Klopp's side aware how crucial an away goal could be in this tie.

There are of course two huge Champions League ties tonight, and to say the other game is a huge one is an understatement.

The two sides met at the same stage of last year's competition, with the Catalan giants coming out on top with a 4-1 victory on aggregate.

Ciro Immobile starts for Borussia Dortmund tonight as he makes a returns to the club where he started his career.

The 25-year-old has scored seven goals in all competitions since joining Jurgen Klopp's side in June.

Juventus have provided flags for all of their fans tonight. Expect an electric atmosphere at the Juventus Stadium with both sets of supporters known to be very vocal.

Weidenfeller, Piszczek, Sokratis, Hummels, Schmelzer, Gundogan, Sahin, Mkhitaryan, Reus, Aubameyang, Immobile.

Buffon, Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra, Marchisio, Pirlo, Pogba, Vidal, Tevez, Morata.

 

Tonight's fixture sees a repeat of the 1997 UEFA Champions League final where a Borussia Dortmund side - including former Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert - reigned victorious in a 3-1 win.

The Italian champions - who last made the last eight of this competition back in 2006 - will be hoping for an altogether different result this time around and will go into the game in buoyant mood, as they currently sit nine points clear at the top of Serie A.

Opponents Dortmund have struggled in the Bundesliga this term, but after three straight league wins, Jurgen Klopp's men will fancy their chances in Turin.
