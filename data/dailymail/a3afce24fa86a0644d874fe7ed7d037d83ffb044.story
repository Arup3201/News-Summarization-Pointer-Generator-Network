The teenage Florida motorcyclist seen in dashcam footage speeding past multiple police officers on Monday is now telling his side.

Santiago Guerra Pineda, 19, said in an exclusive interview with CBSMiami that he did not realize police were driving behind him on I-75 Monday - and that his motorcycle 'took control' of him.

'Honestly I was just heading back home,' Guerra told CBSMiami. 'Yes I was speeding, but - and I did the see the cops but on the side. But at no point did I plan on running from the cops.

'The thing is when you ride the motorcycle you can’t let the motorcycle get control of you and at that moment the motorcycle took control of me and I just kept going faster and faster.'

Pineda was seen in Florida Highway Patrol footage racing past officers, the station notes.

'He was at a hundred, over 150 and he went off around the shoulder to avoid me,' one officer says, before a second says Guerra traveled past him at 135 miles per hour, and again at 157 miles per hour.

Big grin: Pineda, seen in this mug shot, said he smiled after the officer taking the photo said 'This one's for Facebook'

'Once you’re on the bike in this 
position, leaning forward, you can’t see the mirrors. You can't see 
anything from the wind. I'm just looking forward,' he said to reporter 
Peter D'Oench.

Guerra also admitted to enjoying the rush of a 'thrill ride.'

'I am having a thrill ride,' he told the station.  'I do like the feeling of the thrill. It’s a thrill ride. When you ride you are tucked in low with your helmet and the wind around you. And you have no visibility and the wind is hitting you.'

Regarding his smiling mugshot, Guerra told CBSMiami '[the officer] went to take my picture and he told me to look up and when I looked on he said this one is for Facebook and that is when I started laughing just before he took the picture.' Guerra said he previously joked with the officer about a mug shot appearing online.

Guerra told CBSMiami he has a court hearing on July 7 for charges of reckless driving and fleeing or eluding troopers at a high rate of speed.
