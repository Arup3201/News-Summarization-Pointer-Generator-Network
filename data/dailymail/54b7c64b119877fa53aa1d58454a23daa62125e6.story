Most people return from holiday with a tan or perhaps a touch of sunburn, but a surprising number of British women are coming back with a slightly more long-last memento of their time off work: A baby.

One in five mothers become pregnant while on holiday, according to a new poll.

The survey of 2,000 people found 18 per cent of British women admitted conceiving while on holiday.

Spain topped the table with 19 per cent conceiving in the traditional British tourist hotspot, closelyÂ  followed by the UK, with 15 per cent becoming pregnant during a 'staycation.'

A poll found that a fifth of British women conceive while on holiday. The most popular destination was Spain, closely followed by UK 'staycations'

France came third, with 12 per cent saying it was where they started or added to their family, Italy came fourth with nine per cent admitting they'd become pregnant there and Portugal came fifth with seven per cent.

Researchers at Hotels.com also found that celebrity conceptions are influencing holidaymakers, with five per cent saying they were inspired to travel to Singapore amid rumours the Royal baby was conceived there.

Other celebrities who have affected British parents-to-be's travel choices include Victoria Beckham for Brooklyn in New York, Kim Kardashian for Rome and Beyonce for Paris.

All were rumoured or admitted to having become pregnant while travelling.

Surprisingly, men were more inspired to holiday in a celebrity conception destination than their female counterparts, with five per cent of men wanting to treat their partner to a Singaporean holiday, compared to only three per cent of women.

Laura Watts, of Hotels.com, said: 'It's incredible to see celebrity conceptions are influential for some Brits when looking to book their next holiday - who knows where the next hotspot will be.

'We can see which destinations bring out
our amorous side, especially in men, resulting in a holiday memory that
will last a lifetime.'

The relaxed atmosphere - and flowing drinks - of a holiday has long been known to bring out person's amorous side. A previous study found that one in 20 British holidaymakers return home with an STD

It's not the first time holiday sex has been shown to have unexpected side effects. Previous research found that one in 20 British holidaymakers returned home with an sexually transmitted disease.

The survey found that almost a quarter of travellers admitted to having had sex with a stranger on holiday and 40 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women admitted having had sex on the beach.

At the time, a spokesman from the Foreign Office said: 'Travellers should practice safe sex at all times. It's advisable to take condoms with you as quality varies in different countries. HIV and Aids, and other sexually transmitted diseases can be caught worldwide.'
