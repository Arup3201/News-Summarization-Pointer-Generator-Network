Senior Sergeant Simon Lamerton strongly urged the driver in question to come forward for everyone concerned in the horrific incident.

'A young person has lost their life, the driver of this car is involved and for the sake of the family and for their own conscience and mental health into the future, these sorts of things you don’t want to carry with you,' he said to the Brisbane paper.

'Not only for your own conscience but also for the family and the purposes for the coronial report.'
