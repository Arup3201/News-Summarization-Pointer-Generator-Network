Saudi Arabia's women have taken a step towards greater equality after they were appointed to a fifth of the seats on the government's advisory council.

King Abdullah announced last year that women would join the unelected Shura Council which acts like a parliament but without formal powers.

Today he appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150-member body as he reconstituted the council for a new four-year term.

King Abdullah has fulfilled his pledge to appoint women to a fifth of the seats in his advisory council

Although the women can attend the assembly, they must enter through a different door and will be separated from their males colleagues by a screen.

They will join the debate via an internal communication system.

Segregation between men and women in the
 oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative Wahhabi sharia 
law.

Restrictions mean they are not allowed to 
drive, they must use separate entrances at banks and offices, and a plan
 to build a city for female workers only has been announced.

The Shura Council acts like a parliament but has no formal powers

From 2015 it was announced by the king 
that women will be able to stand in the country’s municipal elections, 
and while this move has been praised by the human rights groups, 
restrictions will still apply to women.

Women are still greatly restricted in Saudi Arabian society and need permission from their husband or a male relative to work, study, travel or marry

Due to the guardianship system, it 
means women will need permission from a male relative or their husband 
to work, travel, study or marry.

Their testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law.

A grassroots movement to secure women
 the right to drive resulted in the campaign’s leader being jailed 
briefly after posting a video on the internet showing her behind the 
wheel of a car.

The ruling al-Saud family controls most top government posts in the world's top oil exporter. The king appoints the cabinet.

The only elections are for municipal councils that wield little power.

The Shura Council, composed mostly of academics, clerics, businessmen and former civil servants, vets legislation, recommending changes or additions to the government.

In his 2011 decree, King Abdullah also said women would be able to vote and stand for office in the municipal polls.

Liberals in the Gulf Arab state say Abdullah, who became king in 2005 after effectively ruling as crown prince for a decade before that, has pushed for modest social change, calling for women to have more opportunities to work.

Powerful conservative Sunni Muslim clerics have sometimes argued against allowing women a role in politics.

To comply with the kingdom's rigorous policy of gender segregation, the Shura council building must now be altered to include a separate entrance for women, the decree said.
