Drivers on this newly-built highway found themselves on a road to nowhere when they hit an entire farm blocking the route.

Most of the residents of Dongying, China, accepted pay packages to move out and allow for construction on the road.

But farmer Ye Tan, 72, and his wife Shen, 71, felt they were not offered enough - so stayed put.

No way: Motorists following their sat nav in Dongying, China, were not warned of this farm blocking the route

Refusing to miss the deadline, the local council simply built either side of it.

Now, Mr Tan's barn and yard - home to a goat and a few chickens - straddles the highway in east China's Shandong province, completely blocking any cars from getting past.

Small vehicles can make their way round on a narrow dirt track to the side.

Lorries, however, will have to turn back and take a diversion.

Motorists have blasted the construction workers for failing to notify anyone about the obstacle, which does not show up on sat navs.  

Stubborn: Farmer Ye Tan refused to sell up and move on so construction workers simply built either side of him

Conflict: Small vehicles can attempt to slip round the property on a dirt track but lorries will have to turn back

Lian He, 35, told local media: 'I couldn't believe it when I was travelling down the road and it just ended at the farm.

'On both sides there is a massive construction site and the only way to get past was to use a dirt path which I doubt would be wide enough for a lorry and certainly not for two cars. 

'My navigation system told me it was the best short cut but clearly nobody had told the people that programmed it about the farmhouse.'  

The conflict is one of many across China as swathes of land are being snapped up by construction firms to build industrial complexes, highways and residential estates.

Nail house: Properties like Mr Tan's are referred to as nail houses because the stand out like a nail in a wall

Properties like Mr Tan's are known locally as nail households, because they stand out like a lone nail in a solitary wooden fence post.

The images that ended up widely shared on Chinese social media network Weibo were largely confined to attracting criticism of the local council for rushing the building work through without signing up the land. 

The road was branded effectively pointless until the farmer is removed.

However the council say that their hands are tied to paying approved rates for land to prevent setting a bad example and encouraging others to hold out for a good price.
