A woman has died and 84 people have been hospitalized after smoke engulfed a train carriage and a station platform during a huge electrical malfunction on the Washington D.C. Metro on Monday afternoon.

Around 200 people were evacuated from L'Enfant Plaza  at 3.20pm after the thick cloud of smoke barreled through the carriages, leaving hundreds of commuters in need of medical attention and causing chaos during the city's rush hour.

A woman on the train - which had stopped 800ft short of the platform when the smoke began pouring in - was taken to hospital after paramedics arrived on the scene. She later died. It was the first fatality on the Metro system since a 2009 crash that killed eight passengers and a train operator.

Others on the train started choking and lost consciousness as they waited for help to arrive as the smoke billowed from the malfunction deeper in the tunnel. Two people are said to be in a critical condition at George Washington Hospital.

An initial investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the smoke had been caused by an 'electrical-arcing event'. An arcing occurs when electricity from the third rail comes into contact with another substance that conducts electricity, such as water, and may generate smoke.

Engulfed: Smoke is seen hovering over L'Enfant Plaza Metro station in Washington D.C. after thick smoke filled one of the tunnels and a station platform on Monday afternoon. One woman died as a result and more than 80 people were taken to hospital

Caught-up: Two men who were in the station when it started to fill with thick smoke wait outside. One is given an oxygen mask by firefighters to combat smoke inhalation 

Trapped: Terrified commuters crouch onto the floor of the smoke-filled train. Some said they were left inside for as long as an hour

Horrifying: A man is seen being dragged from one of the carriages by firefighters holding flashlights 

While there was water in the tunnel, NTSB investigator Michael Flanigon said the cause of the arcing was not yet known.

'The third rail is high-voltage direct current, and if that current starts arcing to another conductor that it is not designed to connect with, you get a flash,' Flanigon said. 'In certain cases, that arc can start sort of feeding on itself, and it actually generates gases that are more conductive.' 

Forty of the injured were transported by bus to Howard University Hospital, and between 20 and 25 people were taken to Washington Hospital Center. As well as the 84 people who were hospitalized, 200 people are being evaluated, authorities said.

One firefighter was also said to have been hurt, but does not have life-threatening injuries. 

Panicked commuters described how they lay on the floor of a pitch-black train for 40 minutes in a bid get away from the smoke while announcers told them to 'stay calm'. Others said they waited up to an hour, while some passengers left the trains on their own.

'It started to get scary pretty quick,' passenger Jonathan Rogers told The Washington Post. 'People started praying. Smoke was coming in pretty steadily.' 

Those who caught up in the smoke were seen walking away from the station with black soot under their noses. Emergency workers escorted smoke inhalation victims to medical aid buses to receive oxygen. 

Adjoa Adofo, 30, a public relations worker who was on her way to Virginia, told the Washington Post: 'People were panicking. We didn't know what to do and and we weren't getting a lot of information.' 

She also described how one man suffered a seizure while another terrified man started banging on the closed doors.   

Dense: A man is seen lying on the floor of the dark carriage as smoke flows through the closed doors 

Evacuation: Firefighters are seen guiding passengers through the blackened subway tunnels to safety 

Response: A woman is taken into the back of an ambulance. As many as 200 passengers were being evaluated after the incident

Alec Dubois, a freshman at Gonzaga University, told CNN affiliate WJLA: 'People were freaking out, going everywhere. The conductor was telling us to stay calm. He said he was trying to get our train back to the station. 

'We had no cell service. I was trying to call my parents. And then there was black stuff everywhere, it was all over my pants, too. It was under our noses. We have no idea what it was.' 

There were huge delays on the Metro system as a result with a number of lines stopping services or diverting journeys as the smoke was ventilated out of the surrounding tunnels. 

The yellow line remained shut down Tuesday morning, and the system's orange, blue and silver lines were on a reduced schedule. Service on the green and red lines was normal. 

NTSB railroad accident investigator Mike Flanigon told the DailyMail.com: 'Just after 3 pm ET today, a six-car Yellow Line train, traveling southbound from L'Enfant Metro station, stopped about 800 feet inside the tunnel leading towards the Pentagon. 

'About 1100 feet in front of the train there was an electrical arcing event involving the trackside power cables (the third rail). The tunnel was filled with smoke. Passengers on the train self-evacuated. The train did not derail. There was no fire on the train.

'The NTSB will be finishing up its on-scene work tonight and releasing the site to WMATA. Investigators will conduct a post-recovery examination of the train tomorrow to document the equipment. 

Taking cover: The station was evacuated on Monday and one person - a female passenger - later died

Help: Firefighters assist a man and set up mass casuality procedures to treat the passengers who were exposed to the smoke

Aftermath: Two men caught up in the smoke hold their hands on their chests as they are led onto a bus 

Attention: Commuters who were inside the downtown Washington D.C. station at the time are led to a bus to receive medical treatment

Personnel: A Metro Transit Police officer walks up the escalator at L'Enfant Plaza Station in Washington

Support: A firefighter puts his arm around a woman and guides her to a bus so she can receive medical attention 

Investigative groups will include train operations, survival factors and emergency response, and fire science.

D.C. Firefighters union Local 36 described the incident as a 'Mass Casualty' event, meaning additional resources were needed because it was such a large-scale incident. 

In response to the tragic death, Metro General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Richard Sarles said in a statement: 'There was a woman who was in distress on that train, and I'm sorry to say she's passed away.'

According to WUSA 9, there was a track fire at the same station last Wednesday. A piece of debris was caught in a light grate, filling the station with smoke.  

L'Enfant Plaza is near several government buildings, office complexes and restaurants.

Washington's Metro system serves five million people in a 1,500-square-mile (3,885-square kilometer) area, which includes transport to neighboring Virginia and Maryland states.

The trains and buses provide about 2.3 million trips per year, according to WMATA.

Concern: Two firefighters speak with a victim following the evacuation. The smoke caused chaos for commuter's in the nation's capital

Law enforcement: An FBI Medic, center, helps people onto a bus after they were evacuated from a smoke filled Metro subway tunnel

Area: A woman coughs hard as she and another woman speaks on the phone during the evacuation of people from the smoke-filled Metro subway tunnel in Washington

City: The scaffolding surrounding the top of the U.S. Capitol is seen in the background with a number of police cars parked in front of L'Enfant subway station
