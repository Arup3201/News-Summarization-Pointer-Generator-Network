Brawl: Paul Vice will still receive his medal after being given a conditional discharge

A Royal Marine due to receive a bravery medal from the Queen has been 
given a two-year conditional discharge for biting a man's arm during a brawl.

Corporal Paul Vice, 29, became embroiled in a fight after a row in a city pub escalated.

A court heard how Vice, who suffered horrendous injuries after being
blown up by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, is due to receive the 
Military Cross later this year.

Exeter magistrates said they were 'sad to see someone like him' before 
them as they issued the conditional discharge, which allows him to still
receive the medal.

A custodial term could have prompted a dishonourable discharge from military service.

Father-of-four Vice, from Exeter, 
Devon, was charged with using 
threatening, abusive or insulting words and behaviour alongside Krystle 
George, 28, who faced the same charge and two charges of assault 
by beating.

Chris Brittlestone, prosecuting, said the incident started in Walkabout 
bar on February 4, where George encountered two former friends, Leah 
Grant and Lizzie Westcott.

George kicked one of the women and pulled their hair before pub staff separated them.

The victims reported the matter to the police.

George had been out with her husband Nicholas as well as Vice and his 
wife Tessa, and they decided to drive to Grant’s home in Kennford, 
Exeter, in the early hours of February 5.

Mr Brittlestone said: 'They tried to get in and Mrs Grant, along with her husband, Chris, refused to allow them.

'Vice reached in and tried to pull Mr Grant out, biting him on the forearm.

“It was a substantial contretemps.'

The court was presented with a number of references praising Vice, who served in Afghanistan four times and twice in Iraq.

Wounded: Vice's throat was torn open by razor-sharp flying shrapnel and his arms and legs were slashed

Vice was injured alongside five others last year during a tour with Plymouth-based 42 Commando.

His throat was torn open by razor-sharp flying shrapnel and his arms and
legs were slashed. His injuries were so extensive that his heart 
stopped.

He was only saved when a quick-thinking comrade knelt on his throat to stop the bleeding and gave him emergency first aid.

He underwent emergency surgery in Camp Bastion before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

A probation officer explained to the court that Vice could not do 
community service due to the injuries he had suffered which left him 
with paralysis, brain damage and deaf in one ear.

He also said that he 'would not be allowed into Buckingham Palace to collect his medal' if he was to wear an electronic tag.

The court heard Vice was undergoing regular physiotherapy and was expected to receive an honourable discharge next year.

The probation service suggested that if Vice, received a custodial 
sentence he would 'lose his military home, his position, and medal for 
gallantry' which would be a 'disproportionate punishment'.

As well as giving him a two-year conditional discharge, Vice was forced 
to pay £150 in costs and £100 in compensation to Mr Grant.

George was given a 24-week prison sentence suspended for two years. She 
was ordered to pay costs of £150 and £100 in compensation to Mrs Grant.

An MoD spokesman said: 'These proceedings should not detract from any 
previous outstanding service on operations that have been recognised by 
the grant of a decoration.'
