Up to half a million Britons have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying  suddenly at a young age, a health charity estimates

Up to half a million Britons have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying  suddenly at a young age, a health charity estimates.

Years of under-diagnosing inherited heart conditions has seen the estimate shoot up from 380,000, the British Heart Foundation said, creating a deadly legacy that can span generations.

The BHF also warned that someone living with an inherited heart condition has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to their children.

Every year around 600 apparently healthy under-35s die of heart attacks, leaving behind shocked and distraught families.

Now the BHF has launched its Fight for Every Heartbeat campaign to raise awareness and call for more research into faulty heart genes.

BHF medical director Professor Peter Weissberg said: ‘Over recent years researchers have made great strides in identifying some of the genes that cause inherited heart conditions.

‘A genetic test in a child of an affected parent can save their life. More research is now urgently needed to identify all the genes responsible for these deadly disorders.

‘Pinpointing genes which cause these conditions will allow affected children to be protected and, in the long term, will lead to new treatments to overcome the effects of the faulty gene.’

The campaign, which launches on television and online today, features baby Zara Stroud whose mother Caroline discovered that she had a faulty gene for an inherited heart condition before she became pregnant.

She knew that there was a 50:50 chance it could be passed onto her baby.

Zara might have the faulty gene but her condition is being monitored.
