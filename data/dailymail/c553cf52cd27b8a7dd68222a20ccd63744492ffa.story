Free: Gordon Wood, pictured outside court during his 2008 trial over the murder of his girlfriend in Sydney, has now had his conviction quashed

A British-born playboy is to spend his first weekend of freedom in four years after dramatically winning his appeal today for the murder of a Sydney model who he was said to have tossed to her death from a Sydney cliff.

Court officials ordered that 50-year-old Gordon Wood, who was born in Somerset, should be released from prison in New South Wales immediately.

Three appeal court judges said there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wood had killed his 24-year-old model girlfriend Caroline Byrne, 16 years ago.

Wood had been extradited from England, where he was working, to face trial after police investigating the death of Miss Byrne - whose body was found at the foot of a 100ft cliffside suicide spot at the entrance to Sydney harbour in June 1995 - concluded she had been thrown to her death.

Members of Wood's family were in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal when the verdict was handed down.Â 

One of his sisters who was present, Michele Wood, said afterwards: 'It's just a relief, that's what it is.'

His
other sister, Jacqueline Schmidt, added: 'Relieved is an 
understatement. It's been a very long journey that I wouldn't wish on 
anybody.'

Wood's solicitor 
Michael Bowe, who phoned his client at Goulburn Prison to give him the 
news, told the Sydney Morning Herald later: 'He was overwhelmed.

'He went very quiet. I don't he could quite believe it,' he said.'It's been a long time coming.'

Relief: Mr Wood had spent four years in jail after being convicted of throwing model Caroline Byrne (left) over a 100ft cliff in June 1995

Perilous: The notorious suicide spot of The Gap at the entrance to Sydney harbour where Miss Byrne met her death

Wood was expected to be released from prison within hours of the verdict.

During Wood's trial in Sydney in 2008,
Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC said that Miss Byrne could only have landed
'wedged like a spear' between rocks if she was thrown from the top of 
the cliffs by a strong male.

A
police rescue squad officer, Mark Powderly, also told the court at the 
time that the state of Miss Byrne's body - lacking any injuries to her 
legs or body - was unlike any of the other ten to 20 victims he had 
recovered from the scene, known as The Gap.

The
jury was told during the three-month trial that Wood had killed his 
girlfriend because she knew too much about the personal life and 
questionable business affairs of a multi-millionaire Sydney stockbroker,
Rene Rivkin.

Unusual case: The trial heard that Miss Byrne's injuries were unlike any of the other victims that had been recovered from the spot over the years

Wood was born in Bath, Somerset, but 
had emigrated from England to South Africa with his parents before the 
family moved to Australia.

There the tall, muscular fitness 
fanatic led a charmed life as an actor, an aerobics instructor and 
man-about-town with beautiful women on his arm.

But
there were also claims that he was bisexual and had had a torrid affair
with multi-millionaire stockbroker Rene Rivkin, who committed suicide 
with a drugs overdose after he was convicted of insider trading.

As murder inquiries following the discovery of Miss Byrne's body turned towards Wood, he fled Australia.

But he was eventually arrested in a flat in London, where he had landed a job at NatWest bank with a fictitious work history as a financial adviser.

Found guilty of Miss Byrne's murder, he was sentenced to a minimum of 13 years in jail - but now, four years later, he is a free man.

The Court of Criminal Appeal decided today that the evidence presented to the jury in 2008 was flawed and Wood's conviction was unsafe.

There was insufficient evidence, said the three judges, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wood had killed Miss Byrne, although, they said, it was unclear how she fell to her death or whether Wood had any involvement.
