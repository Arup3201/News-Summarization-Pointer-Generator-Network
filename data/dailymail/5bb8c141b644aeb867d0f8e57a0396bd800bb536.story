A close friend of Jimmy Savile today revealed his shame at failing to spot any of the alleged abuse of young girls by the TV star.

DJ 
Dave Eager, who worked with Savile in the 1960s, spoke of his guilt for the first time today as police investigate 300 potential victims of the Jim'll Fix It host.

The 64-year-old declared he 'should be punished' for not realising what was happening throughout their 40 year friendship.

'Eager helper': Dave Eager was so distraught at Savile's funeral in November last year he wore a 'Jim fixed it for me' badge and jumper but has since said he feels guilty for failing to notice any of the alleged abuse done by Savile during their 40-year friendship

But the DJ, who wore a ‘Jimmy’s eager 
helper’ jumper and ‘Jim fixed it for me’ badge as tribute to the star at his funeral in November last year, claims he never saw anything to make him suspect Savile was abusing girls.

He told The Sun: ‘I just don’t recognise this so you end up blaming yourself. 

‘I just don’t know what’s going on. I feel I should be punished. I’m very distressed about the whole thing.’

The pair worked together at the Top 
Ten Club in Manchester in the 1960s where they formed a friendship, 
continuing to stay in touch throughout their careers.

'Would have spoken out': Mr Eager said that if he had seen anything to 
suggest the alleged abuse done by Savile, pictured left on Top Of The 
Pops in 1976 and right in 2007, he would have spoken out

Mr Eager said: ‘You look up to somebody for years and then suddenly wham, bam, wallop, thank you, what have I been doing? 

‘There
is nothing I recognise at all. I can’t help but blame myself and there 
must be other people like me. You think, “Hang on, if we’d seen 
something we would have spoken out”.

‘The 70s were the 70s and we were having fun. A lot of it was a bit of a blur because we were all having a bit of fun. 

‘But when I read in the paper something about a nine-year-old boy, or whatever, I think, “This can’t be real”.’

DJ pals: Mr Eager knew Savile from working together at the Top Ten Club in Manchester in the 1960s and remained friends throughout their careers

As the scandal went public and 
the allegations worsened, Mr Eager decided to leave his home in Thornton
Cleveleys, Lancashire and headed for Spain.

Of their 40-year friendship, Mr Eager
said: ‘I knew him through working as a DJ. I was based at the Top Ten 
and I met him originally when I was in a band. 

‘Jim tended to keep things in compartments and people only knew a few of his friends. 

‘After
the Top Ten, Jim moved out of Manchester and people at the club hardly 
ever saw him. I kept in touch and we’d bump into each other every now 
and then.’

Mr Eager found it hard to believe that none of those close to Savile had not known about the abuse that carried on for years.

He
said: ‘Everyone knows Jim was a canny fella. Compared to Jim, I’m 
insignificant but he was mixing with people who were equally as shrewd 
and canny and had reputations to protect. 

‘What
I can’t get my head around is if there were so many shrewd and canny 
people around him, how come they didn’t see anything? 

‘For
them all to say they didn’t notice, well it all sounds unbelievable. 
Like a lot of others I’m completely and utterly gobsmacked. 

‘You
feel traumatised and sorry for the people abused by Jimmy but equally 
you think, “Why the bloody hell didn’t we see something?”’

Mr
Eager’s comments come after it was revealed that Savile was barred from
any involvement with the BBC's Children In Need charity.

Repeated complaints were made by victims made to police, including officers in Surrey, 
Sussex and Jersey but officers found that there was not enough 
evidence to proceed with the allegations they received.

Two potential 
victims came forward to Scotland Yard - one of whom claimed she had been
abused in the 1970s but did not want to pursue a criminal 
investigation.

An 
independent probe has been launched into the BBC's ‘culture and 
practices’ during Savile's career, led by former Court of Appeal judge 
Dame Janet Smith.

In connection: Former pop star Gary Glitter returns home after he was arrested and questioned by police over the weekend in connection with the Savile investigation

Former pop star Gary Glitter was arrested over the weekend in connection with the Savile investigation.

Metropolitan police detectives questioned him for ten hours before releasing him on bail. 

Comedian
Freddie Starr has strenuously denied allegations that he groped a 14-year-old girl in 
Savile’s BBC dressing room but he announced on Friday that he was 
prepared to speak to police investigating claims of abuse by Savile.

Police are expected to make several arrests this week, having warned Savile’s living accomplices that ‘we are coming for you’.
