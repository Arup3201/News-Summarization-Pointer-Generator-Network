A mother-of-two and her young daughters have chopped off their long locks in an effort to show how even the smallest of actions can help someone.

Melinda Bowden and her children Lana, seven, and Lacie Rees, five, from Stroud in New South Wales, all had much-loved hair that flowed well past their waists.

But in an effort to help those suffering through cancer, they chopped their locks and donated them to a program run by Pantene and Look Good… Feel Better to be turned into wigs after the illness struck too close to home.

Melinda Bowden and her children Lana, 7, and Lacie Rees, 5, cut their wait long hair and donated it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients

'My aunty had breast cancer and then a few years later it came back in her bones – she was terminal,' Ms Bowden told Daily Mail Australia.

'She had mastectomy and then about five years later it came back as secondary breast cancer- she has it in her pelvis and there is nothing they can do for her.

'She went through chemo and I know how that made her feel, having no hair. It's such a simple thing that you can do that can change someone's self-esteem.'

Ms Bowden's daughters, the youngest of which had never had her hair trimmed, both jumped on board the idea of donating their locks. 

Ms Bowden said she was inspired by her aunty, who was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer

Lacie, five, had never had her hair cut before, but both girls jumped up at the idea

'They were quite excited to have it cut and they were even happier when I told them about donating it and that it was going to someone special,' their mother said. 

Look Good… Feel Better is a charity that runs thousands of workshops through volunteers across the country which supports cancer patients through the appearance-related side-effects that are caused by their treatments.

Six to eight ponytails are needed to make each wig, which is then distributed free of charge and cut and styled to suit each recipient, according to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths campaign.

Over 10,000 ponytails have been donated across Australia and New Zealand since the program’s launch.
