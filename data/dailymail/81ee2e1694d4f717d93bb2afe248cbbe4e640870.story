Winner: Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah was celebrated in the London 2012 Olympic Parade. His fame hasn't swayed US customs officials who still insisted on going through checks even after seeing his medals

As one of the most famous athletes in the world, getting recognised can be a problem for Mo Farah. Everywhere except in American airports, that is.

For more than a year after his double gold medal triumph at London 2012, the Olympic star is still 'always' pulled aside by suspicious US customs officials - because his full name is Mohamed, he said today.

Even showing them his medals does not stop them suspecting he is a terrorist and questioning him.

But the runner also told how it is impossible for him to train in Britain - because he is too well known and would get mobbed by fans.

Farah, who moved to Portland, Oregon, two years ago to work with coach Alberto Salazar, said: 'I'm always stopped by US customs. I think it's something to do with my name, that's the only thing I can put together.

'I always get stopped and get questioned. It used to be really bad where you'd get stopped and go through to a room and they'd do an extra search - "What are you doing here? How many countries you been to?".'

Asked if he'd ever been tempted to show them his 5,000m and 10,000m gold medals, he said: 'I did at one point when I was coming through and they were like "No matter, I still need to do this search".'

Somali-born Farah, 30, who moved to the UK with his British-born father at eight, remains sanguine about the situation, however, and believes it is down to 'the system on the computer'.

Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: 'When I was coming here even, I was trying to check in and it won't let me check in so I go to the lady and ask her to check in and then she had to make a special call.

'Before you actually check in you have to make a call to make sure you're clear then you check in. I always have a fair problem.'

Previously it has been reported that Farah, who was awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours list, was hauled aside at customs as he returned to his training base in Oregon just before last Christmas.

Afterwards, he said: 'I even got my medals out to show who I am, but they wouldn't have it.' He was eventually allowed into the US.

Farah, who trains in Kenya as well as the US, also told how despite his love of the fans who cheered him on to double Olympic glory, he could not train in the UK because his fame and the attention it brings would interrupt his strict regime.

'It's not possible for me to train in 
Britain because of the amount of miles I do. I love the people, I love 
the support and I want to be here, but if I want to win medals I need 
the simple life - eat, sleep, train, not worry about anything else,' he 
said.

'Unfortunately I can't do that right now. But I will be back at some point.' Farah is currently in the UK promoting his autobiography Twin Ambitions. While he was being brought up in the UK, his twin brother Hassan was 6000 miles away in Somalia.

Although they were separated until he went to his brother's wedding in 2003, Farah says they have since been in touch every day and 'the way I see it we are not different people, we are part of the same person'.

He added: 'I made him run with me in 2003. I was quite amused because he almost kept up with me for a little while.'Â 

Farah's 'new goal' is to prove himself as a marathon runner in next year's London Marathon, but he dismissed reports he'd said he could cover the 26.2 miles in under two hours.

'To say I'm going to break two hours when I've never run a marathon is crazy,' said Farah, who ran half the event this year as preparation for his full debut in 2014. 'My target is to get close to the British record which is 2 minutes 7 seconds.'
