Harvey Weinstein has revealed that he is planning a movie starring Meryl Streep that he hopes will bring down the gun industry.

The mega-producer let the yet-unannounced plan slip during an interview with radio host Howard Stern.

'I shouldn’t say this, but I’ll tell it to you, Howard. I’m going to make a movie with Meryl Streep, and we’re going to take this head-on,' he said on Wednesday.

In cahoots: Harvey Weinstein said that he and Meryl Streep, his frequent star, will be working on a movie that lampoons the NRA and the gun industry

'They’re going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them,' he said of the gun industry.

He said that it will not be a documentary but a 'big movie like a "Mr Smith Goes to Washington,"' he said without giving away any plot details.

Weinstein, 61, made it clear that his motive is political as he is openly against the use of guns.

'I don’t think we need guns in this country. And I hate it. I think the NRA is a disaster area,' he said.

He said that his intention is to make the movie such a condemnation of the use of guns in America that the ammunition industry would take a noticeable hit afterwards.

Weinstein said that people will be leaving the movie theater thinking 'Gun stocks — I don’t want to be involved in that stuff'. 

Democrat: Weinstein- seen in 2006 with President Obama, the late Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Senator chuck Schumer- held a fundraiser for President Obama in 2012

'It’s going to be like crash and burn.'

The topic came up when Stern asked about his plans to direct a film based on a book about the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust, but used it as a basis to explain his feelings on guns.

'It's not a Holocaust story as much as it is Jews with guns. It's my whole philosophy. It's the idea that when injustice is that great you can't just march into the camps,' he said.

'I never want to have a gun... This is when you're marching a half a million people into Auschwitz. I'd find a gun if that was happening to my people.'

Less obvious: Meryl Streep has not been politically active like Weinstein, but was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Obama in 2010

The Miramax founder has never been shy about his left-leaning political allegiances as he hosted a $2.5million fundraiser for President Obama at his Westport, Connecticut home in August 2012.

He also spoke about gun control that summer in the led up to the 2012 election, telling the Huffington Post: ‘If we don’t get gun-control laws in this country, we are full of beans. To have the National Rifle Association rule the United States of America is pathetic.’

Though Meryl Streep has kept her political beliefs much more closely guarded, she has not remained as tight-lipped in her adoration of Mr Weinstein.

During her 2012 Golden Globes acceptance speech for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, Streep jokingly called Weinstein ‘God, the punisher’.
