A man convicted of murder in the 1978 shooting death of a Southern California man could be free within a week after 36 years behind bars.

Michael Hanline, who is now 69, could be released after it emerged crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial.

It saw local prosecutors re-examine the evidence and on Wednesday,a judge overturned the 1978 conviction. 

The California Innocence Project, which worked to win the freedom of Mr Hanline, say their case represents the oldest conviction ever reversed in state history.

Ready to leave: Michael Hanline, 68, was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1980 over the death of JT McGarry but new DNA evidence has come to light that put his original conviction in doubt

The shooting death of truck driver J.T. McGarry that led to Hanline's 1980 conviction and his bid for exoneration has been a complicated case to unravel, said Ventura County special assistant district attorney Michael Schwartz.

Prosecutors are still investigating who might have killed McGarry, who had ties to a motorcycle gang, he said.

McGarry, a Ventura resident who also used the name Michael Mathers, dealt in drugs and ran motorcycle-oriented swap meets for the publishers of Easyriders magazine, according to court papers.

He went missing on November 10, 1978, and was found shot to death two days later by a highway.

Hanline, who was romantically involved with McGarry's ex-girlfriend, was arrested on an unrelated charge that month after traveling to Northern California and using McGarry's credit card, court papers stated.

He was charged with murder by prosecutors who suggested his motive was jealousy over McGarry's on-again, off-again relationship with the ex-girlfriend.

He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 

DNA analysis was not conducted at the scene where McGarry's body was discovered because the technology did not exist then. But Ventura County prosecutors said in court papers an analysis this year found the DNA profile of an unidentified male, not Hanline.

In addition, evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline during the trial was withheld from him. 

Special Assistant District Attorney Michael Schwartz said 'flaws in the trial and the totality of evidence cast sufficient doubt to warrant vacating the jury's guilty verdict.'

Ventura County Superior Court Judge Donald Coleman last week ordered Hanline to return to court on November 24 for a hearing, where he will be released on bail based on the DNA tests and investigative reports prosecutors said should have been turned over to defense attorneys in his trial.

'The documents withheld by the government during Mike Hanline's trial and the DNA testing point to another suspect,' Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project, said in an email.

The DA's office will conduct an investigation and decide whether or not to retry him.

Schwartz said that while Hanline's conviction is vacated, prosecutors 'have not concluded that he's factually innocent.' 

'It's possible that Hanline did it, but we're not confident enough at this point that he's guilty to justify keeping him in prison,' Schwartz said. 

The California Innocence Project, which took up the case in 1999, says Hanline's case was the longest wrongful incarceration in state history.

'It's amazing that Mike will finally be released after 36 years of wrongful incarceration,' said Justin Brooks, the director of the project at California Western School of Law. 'It's time for him to get back to his family and his life.'
