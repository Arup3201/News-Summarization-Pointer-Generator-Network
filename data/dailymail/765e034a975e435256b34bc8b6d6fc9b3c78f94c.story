Lucky Liz Denial, from Stapleford, Nottingham, has been able to kit out her home with prizes - which include a 37-inch LCD TV, a home cinema system, two X-boxes and hundreds of bottles of fancy toiletries and cleaning products.

The 51-year-old former bank worker has even bagged herself a five-star VIP holiday to Kenya.

And she has been able to top-up her luxury lifestyle after pocketing Â£16,500 on TV show Deal or No Deal.

Liz, who was forced to give up her job after developing painful muscle condition fibromyalgia, has won a prize every single day since since last October.

Liz said: 'I rely on winning prizes because I don't have a job and my mobility car is very expensive to run.

'Sometimes I have to pinch myself, because I can't believe how lucky I am. Maybe it is karma because I suffer from a lot of pain because of my condition.

'Some of the prizes are small things, like shampoo and cleaning products, but I've also won a 37-inch LCD TV, a home cinema system, two X-Boxes and two iPods.

'I sell the prizes I won't use, like the X-boxes, to my friends.

'When I won the trip to Kenya, I couldn't believe my luck - and I was even fortunate enough to bump into Dermot O'Leary and Olly Murs, who were taking part in a Red Nose Day climb of Mount Kilimanjaro.

'The wackiest prize I've won is definitely a life-size cardboard cut out of Ricky Gervais.

'When the postman delivered it, I didn't know what to do with it.

'Some of my prizes are very strange but others have made my life much easier and definitely more enjoyable.'

Liz met her best friend, Sandy Cox, from Cossall, after appearing on Deal or no Deal.

Sandy said: 'I enter competitions too but I'm nowhere near as lucky as Liz.

'I only won 10p on Deal or No Deal but Liz just keeps hitting the jackpot with everything she applies for.

'And she really deserves her prizes, she is a lovely woman.'
