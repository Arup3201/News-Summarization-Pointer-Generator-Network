A group of water babies dressed up as our favourite Christmas characters are sure to get you in the festive spirit.

Wearing Santa costumes and angel wings, the tiny tots are captured on camera as they explore a watery world.

Underwater photographer Lucy Ray specialises in baby pictures, and has a dressing up box full of character outfits for little ones to wear for their photo shoots.

Up to around six months babies have a gag reflex, and 
being submerged reminds them of being in the womb, meaning when they go 
under water they look utterly at peace

Lucy, 33, who founded Starfish Underwater Photography, makes sure the confident babies have been attending swimming lessons before the shoot in order to get comfortable with being submerged.

Up to around six months babies have a gag reflex and automatically shut their mouths so they don't take in water.

It is believed that being submerged reminds them of being in the womb, meaning when they go 
under water they look utterly at peace.

'This means they hold their breath 
automatically,' says Lucy.

'At the shoot, the parents says the baby's name, then says 'ready, swim!' and then the baby is submerged,' says Lucy.

'They are let go for a couple of seconds while I take the photos then brought straight back up.'

'It doesn't give me very long to take the pictures but I only need a few seconds as my camera can take six frames per second.'

The babies aren't underwater for very long at all - it just looks that way as a split second in time is frozen

'I ask that babies have done a term of baby swimming lessons that include submersions.

'This means they gradually over a few months, build up to going under the water. It starts with splashing on the head, then face, and builds up to a full submersion.

'So in reality the babies aren't underwater for very long at all. It just looks that way as we freeze that split second in time.'

Prices start at Â£30 for half an hour in 
the pool with up to five other children, customers get free use of 
costumes provided and up to six submersions

Lucy, from Greenwich, London, first started to dabble with underwater photography at University when she learned to scuba dive.

'I trained to be a baby and pre-school swimming teacher too so I can teach the babies to swim myself as safety is very important. So this really is quite a career change.

'I'm not a mum yet myself but if I have one, it's sure to be the most photographed swimming baby around.'

Prices start at Â£30 for half an hour in the pool with up to five other children. Customers get free use of costumes provided and up to six submersions.

Pictures are then paid for separately if they choose to buy any, starting at Â£30.
