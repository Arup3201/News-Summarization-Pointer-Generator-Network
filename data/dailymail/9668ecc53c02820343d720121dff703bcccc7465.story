Women only: Grace Belgravia will be women-only and potential members must be invited (file picture)

It's an exclusive London gentleman's club with a difference: gentlemen are not allowed.

High-powered women are set to turn the tables on their male counterparts when the women-only club opens next month.

The backers of Grace Belgravia describe it as 'an exclusive private club for spirited, sophisticated, health-conscious women who want the very best', and say it is the first of its kind.

The 11,500 square feet club is in a grade-two listed building in West Halkin Street, Belgravia, and membership is invite-only, with an annual fee of up to £5,500 a year and a joining fee of £2,000.

The backers have been working on it for more than two years and the philosophy behind it is 'empowering and nurturing women through seven ages of life from young adulthood, through fertility, pregnancy, child rearing, empty nesting, menopause and ageing-well'.

Members-only private clubs for gentlemen were originally set up in the West End of London for British upper class men in the 18th century. They have since spread all over the world.

Many still only admit male clientele, such as Boodle's and Bucks Club, but more are now allowing women members.

A spokesman for Grace Belgravia said interest in the venture had been intense.

He said: 'We were staggered to find there were no clubs like this.

'Since we announced it we have had interest from Singapore, Vienna, Hong Kong and New York to look into opening women-only clubs.

'It's not a uniquely British thing. I think we've really captured the zeitgeist.'

A number of women have already joined, ranging from 21 to 67-years-old from many different walks of life.

Grace will have a spa, gym, studios, beauty salon, boutique, restaurant and bar, relaxation areas and facilities including a library and screening room. It also has two residential GPs.

The medical director of Grace Belgravia is Dr Tim Evans, Apothecary to The Queen.
