Facing jail: Jessica Stroble, 33, refused to expand on the nature of her relationship with Christopher Martin other than to confirm that they are not married and that she has no contact information for him

A couple are facing jail after performing a medley of 'lewd, indecent, and obscene' sex acts on a plane to Las Vegas in full view of travelling families, court papers have alleged.

Jessica Stroble, 33, and Christopher Martin were arrested as they stepped off the Allegiant Airlines flight from Medford, Oregon, after one horrified mother complained to staff: 'This is not the sex education I wanted to give my teenage sons.'

Passengers, including children, looked on in horror as the beauty salon worker grew increasingly intimate with the exposed Martin before performing oral sex on him shortly after takeoff.

Court papers, obtained by website The Smoking Gun, describe in graphic detail how they then engaged in a second sex act mid-way though the 
hour-and-a-half flight and did not even reign in their passionate 
exchange when confronted by airline staff.

They did take a break, however, when the mid-flight drink and snack service came down the aisle, but resumed shortly after.

This time it was Stroble who exposed herself as the tryst became even more heated during the incident in June.

At one point, according to another passenger, Martin appeared to be 'in his own world' as passions grew.

When
approached by The Smoking Gun at the beauty salon in which she works, 
Stroble allegedly claimed she had no idea she was court action. 

And when asked to comment on the specific allegations, she replied: 'None of that happened.'

She
also refused to expand on the nature of her relationship with Martin 
other than to confirm that they are not married and that she has no 
contact information for him.

If found guilty of the misdemeanor charges, Stroble and Martin each face up to 90 days in jail and a fine.

It's not the first time an amorous couple has been arrested for trying to join the 'mile-high club'.

In 2010, an Australian couple were arrested after being caught having sex in a Jetstar plane's bathroom.

The
unidentified 44-year-old man and 39-year-old woman were arrested after 
the man reportedly became 'abusive' towards cabin crew after the duo was
found.

He was charged with disorderly conduct. His mile-high partner, however, was released.

And in 2007, an abusive British couple who had sex in an aeroplane toilet and then
forced their flight to be diverted at a cost of more than
£12,000 were jailed.

Trevor Blake, 44, and Nicola Fitzgerald, 27, had to be
restrained on board British Airways flight 2263 en route from
Gatwick to Kingston, Jamaica.

A judge said their actions had caused fear among other
passengers, including mothers and their children.

At Hove Crown Court, Recorder Christopher Morris-Coole jailed Blake for 12 months and handed his fiancee Fitzgerald a three-month prison term, suspended for 12 months.
