A chemical compound found in spicy curries could help reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer, a study has found.

Researchers gave capsaicin, which gives chilli peppers their heat, to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract.

The capsaicin triggered a pain receptor in the cells lining their intestines, setting off a reaction that reduced the risk of growing colorectal tumours.

Scientists found that the treatment extended the lifespan of the mice by more than 30 per cent.

And it was even more effective when combined with celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug already approved for treating some forms of arthritis.

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the UK, with doctors diagnosing an average of 41,000 new cases of the disease every year.

The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, recommended that patients at risk of getting colon or rectal cancers should be given capsaicin as part of their diet to inhibit tumour growth.

Capsaicin is already used as an analgesic
 in topical ointments, where it acts as an irritant overwhelming nerves 
reducing their ability to report pain for extended periods of time. It 
is also used in pepper spray.

The receptor or ion channel that is triggered by the capsicin - called TRPV1 - was originally discovered in sensory neurons reacting to heat, acidity and spicy chemicals in the environment.

But the study found TPRV1 was also expressed by epithelial cells in the lining of the intestines, where it is activated by epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR.

EGFR was an important driver of cell proliferation in the intestines, whose epithelial lining is replaced approximately every four to six days.

Dr Petrus de Jong added: 'A basic level of EGFR activity is required to maintain the normal cell turnover in the gut. However, if EGFR signaling is left unrestrained, the risk of sporadic tumor development increases.'

They found that mice genetically modified to be TRPV1-deficient suffered higher-than-normal rates of intestinal tumour growths.

Dr Petrus de Jong added: 'These results showed us that epithelial TRPV1 normally works as a tumour suppressor in the intestines.'

Molecular studies of human colorectal cancer samples recently uncovered multiple mutations in the TRPV1 gene, though there was no direct evidence that TRPV1 deficiency was a risk factor for colorectal cancer in humans.

Dr Raz added:  ‘Our data suggest that individuals at high risk of developing recurrent intestinal tumours may benefit.’
