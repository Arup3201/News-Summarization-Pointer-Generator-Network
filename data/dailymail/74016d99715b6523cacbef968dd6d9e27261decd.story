Two University of Miami football players have admitted to getting a 17-year-old classmate drunk and then repeatedly raping her in their dorm room, police have said.

JaWand Blue and Alex Figueroa, both 20-year-old linebackers, turned themselves into authorities on Tuesday and were arrested on sexual battery charges following the attack on July 5.

The men allegedly confessed to buying several alcoholic beverages for the victim and administered - or knew that someone else had administered - a drug that made her 'physically helpless to resist'.

As she was incapacitated, they allegedly performed sexual acts without her consent, an affidavit said, the Miami Herald reported.

After the alleged attack in Figueroa's dorm room in Pearson Hall, the girl went to university police and the Coral Gables police department investigated.

Both men have been kicked off the football team and barred from campus, Miami athletic director Blake James said in a statement.

'Any allegation of a sexual assault is extremely serious, and the University will not tolerate conduct that threatens the sanctity and safety of our students and our campus,' he said.

'We hold all of our students – especially student athletes – to the highest standards of moral conduct.'

Both players' names were taken off Miami's official 2014 roster on the school's athletics website.

Just hours after the alleged attack, the men laughed as they filmed a Vine video and posted it to Twitter.

University
 president Donna Shalala added that she had spoken with the victim, an 
unidentified Miami student, and said the school has 'zero tolerance for 
sexual assault'.

'There
 is no confusion about our responsibility as a university: we will fully
 and compassionately support the victim of sexual assault,' she said.

Blue and Figueroa have been released on $10,000 bond each and are scheduled to be arraigned later this month. Figueroa has also been charged with possessing a stolen or forged driver's license.

Figueroa, the son of two Marines, from Stafford, Virginia, had played in nine games last season and was expected to be the starting strong-side linebacker for UM this fall.

Blue ended played in two games as a freshman in 2013.

As a senior in high school in 2011, he was suspended for two weeks by the Florida High School Athletic Association for throwing a punch during a preseason game, the Palm Beach Post reported.
