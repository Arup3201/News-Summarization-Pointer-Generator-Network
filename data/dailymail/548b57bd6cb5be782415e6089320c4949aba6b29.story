Is this the death knell for  florescent U-shaped pillows? A doctor from Virginia, US, thinks he's come up with a solution to every traveller's worst problem; sleeping on the move.

After suffering a sports related injury which made sleeping on trains, planes or in cars hellish, Dr Ravi Shamaiengar decided to invent something more supportive than what was already on the market.

The result is Nap Anywhere, a disc-shaped head support pillow that starts out life as a flat disc about one inch thick.  

Sweet dreams: Dr Ravi Shamaiengar decided to invent a better support after suffering a sports related injury 

Nap Anywhere costs $59 (£36) and comes in different colours including cobalt, lime (left) and cream (right)

You twist it into shape, pull the shoulder strap on to hold it in place then rest your head on the foam structure which moulds slightly to your face and neck.

It's small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag and works by allowing the muscles in your neck to relax. Whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby and keen to catch up on forty winks yourself, this could be your saviour.

Shamaiengar raised $67,819 (£42,000) for his project on Kickstarter - smashing his $40,000 (£25,000) goal.

He wrote on his pitch: 'Have you ever fallen asleep upright, perhaps while traveling, and awakened with neck discomfort? Me too!

'Like many, I would use a U-shaped neck pillow. Unfortunately, the support I needed just wasn't there. In addition, they are often too bulky to fit in my backpack.

Supportive: The neck pillow is easily put on and is small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag

Strapping: the strap is adjustable and sits below the armpit

Whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby, this could be your saviour

'And if you are like me, you feel claustrophobic when things are wrapped around your neck. 

'And who wants to inflate a device every time you need to use it?

'During a flight about four years ago, I awoke with neck discomfort again and started drawing out the idea that would eventually become the NapAnywhere.'

Out with the old: Foam pillows available  widely but, according to the doctor, that don't give adequate support

Dr Shamaiengar added: 'As a physician... I strive to have an impact on people's lives every day. I truly believe with the Nap Anywhere I can help more people than ever before.

'With your support we can fund the initial manufacturing runs and turn the neck pillow business on its ear.'

One of the support's first customers, Nita Dillard Faught, commented on Facebook, 'I love myNapAnywhere! Ravi did a great job.'
