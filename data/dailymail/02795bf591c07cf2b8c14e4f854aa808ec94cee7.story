Ray Rice is fighting back against the NFL one week after video of him punching his then-fiancée Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City casino elevator went public.

Rice, 27, is expected to file an appeal with the help of the NFL Players' Association and an outside attorney later today, claiming he notified both the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL about his altercation back in June of this year.

The running back was originally just handed down a two-game suspension as a result of his actions in July for violating the NFL personal conduct policy.

Appeal: Ray Rice (above right, with now-wife Janay Rice) is expected to appeal his indefinite suspension from the NFL later today

Harsher penalty: Rice had his punishment increased from a two-game suspension after video of him punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday

Rice must file his appeal by 11:59 pm on Tuesday, three business days after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell officially notified the players' union of his indefinite suspension.

Sources tell The Baltimore Sun that the football star is also considering possible legal action following his increased discipline from the league, feeling that he has been punished twice for the same offense.

In his letter to the Player's Association on Friday explaining Rice's new punishment, Goodell wrote, 'This video shows a starkly different sequence of events from what you and your representatives stated when we met on June 16, and is important new information that warrants reconsideration of the discipline imposed on you in July.'

The commissioner added, 'Based on this new information, I have concluded that the discipline imposed upon you in July was insufficient under all the circumstances and have determined instead to impose an indefinite suspension.' 

In the dark: In a letter to the Players' Association, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell claims he was unaware of the severity of the abuse prior to seeing last week's video

Support: Many fans have rallied behind Rice, who feels he is being punished twice for the same mistake

Public support: Rice and wife Janay appeared together for the first time since the incident over then weekend, attending a high school football game in New Rochelle, New York

There has been some debate however over how much Goodell knew of the situation prior to last Monday, with one anonymous New Jersey law enforcement official saying last week he personally sent a tape of the incident to an NFL executive in April. 

Multiple sources close to Rice also back up the story that the athlete was honest and upfront about the events that took place in that elevator last February when he met with Goodell in June.

Furthermore, under Article 46, Section 4 of the NFL collective bargaining agreement, it states, 'The Commissioner and a Club will not both discipline a player for the same act or conduct. The Commissioner’s disciplinary action will preclude or supersede disciplinary action by any Club for the same act or conduct.'

Prior to his suspension by the NFL Monday afternoon, Rice had his five-year, $35 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens terminated, losing $3.529 million in salary for the season.

While Rice has yet to make any public statement about the appeal or possible legal action, he did make his first public appearance since this video surfaced last week, attending a high school football game with his now-wife Janay and daughter in New Rochelle, New York over the weekend. 

Janay has been incredibly critical of the media in the days following the release of this tape, writing last week on her private Instagram, 'I woke up this morning feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I’m mourning the death of my closest friend. But to have to accept the fact that it’s reality is a nightmare in itself. No one knows the pain that hte [sic] media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family. To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing. To take something away from the man I love that he has worked his ass of for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific.' 

She continued, 'THIS IS OUR LIFE! What don’t you all get. If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you’ve succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is! Ravensnation we love you!'

Mrs. Rice also showed her support for another individual under fire from the NFL this weekend,saying on Twitter that the league has no right to tell Adrian Peterson how to discipline his child.

Peterson was recently indicted on charges of child abuse for beating one of his sons with a tree branch last May.
