Alex Salmond today conceded there are alternative
‘options’ to the British pound as the crisis deepened over his plans for an
independent Scotland’s currency.

The First Minister denied that he does not have a back-up
plan, signalling that he could go into this year’s referendum with a proposal
for a new Scottish currency.

But Mr Salmond is coming under intense pressure to reveal
his chosen ‘plan B’, with the country’s top business leaders demanding answers.

Under pressure: Alex Salmond said other options were presented by the Scottish Government's 'fiscal commission working group' ¿ which included a 'new Scottish currency'

The row comes after Chancellor George Osborne, Shadow
Chancellor Ed Balls and LibDem Treasury chief Danny Alexander this week
comprehensively rejected any deal to share the pound in a ‘currency union’ with
a separate Scotland.

The game-changing move has left the Nationalists in
disarray just seven months before Scotland’s future is decided on September 18.

Mr Salmond said other options were presented by
the Scottish Government’s ‘fiscal commission working group’ – which included a
‘new Scottish currency’, either with a fixed exchange rate to the pound or a
‘floating’ exchange rate.

A ‘Scottish pound’ could be pegged on a one-to-one basis
with the British pound, in the way the Irish pound was until 1979. There would
be a Scottish central bank to replace the Bank of England to ensure the
credibility of the currency, and there would need to be large reserve of
sterling.

Mr Salmond’s fiscal commission found last year: ‘In the long
run, the creation of a new Scottish currency would represent a significant
increase in economic sovereignty.’

However, it would be a major challenge to decide how
contracts, savings, pensions and salaries would be converted at the start into
values in the new currency.

'Keeping millions of British pounds in reserve would
also limit Scottish ministers’ ability to invest in public services.

And if the markets were unsure about a new Scottish
currency, a premium could be added to interest rates – forcing Scots to pay
more for loans and mortgages.

Mr Osborne used a speech in Edinburgh to insist the currency was not like a CD collection to be divided up in the event of a 'messy divorce'

During an exchange on BBC's Good Morning Scotland, First Minister Alex Salmond was keen to stress there were alternatives to an independent Scotland keeping the pound:

BBC's Jim Naughtie: Does that mean in the event of a yes vote you go into negotiations without another option in your back pocket?

Alex Salmond: Well let me say for the third time Jim that the fiscal commission working group set out all of the monetary policy options for an independent Scotland but recommended the best one was a sterling area and that’s the one that we’re going to be articulating and that’s what you’d expect us to do….

Naughtie: OK Alex Salmond says there is no alternative...

Salmond: No I didn’t say that Jim, I said...

Naughtie: I’m just checking...

Salmond: Try again, I said the Fiscal Commission Working Group set out a range of monetary policy options for an independent Scotland.

Other currency options include unilaterally choosing to use
the pound with no control over monetary policy – adopting a formula used by
Panama, East Timor and the Federated States of Micronesia. Yesterday, a graphic
appeared on Yes Scotland’s Facebook page which stated: ‘An independent Scotland
would not need Westminster’s permission to continue using the pound.’

Or a separate Scottish Government could try to persuade
European nations to let the country join the Euro – which was once Mr Salmond’s
favoured option.

Mr Salmond was interviewed on BBC radio show Good Morning
Scotland, after spending much of Thursday at his Aberdeenshire home
and avoiding the TV cameras as his independence plans crumbled around him.

The First Minister was asked by presented Jim Naughtie if he
would go into negotiations following a ‘Yes’ victory ‘without another option in
your back pocket’?

‘The fiscal commission working group set out all of the
monetary policy options for an independent Scotland but recommended the best
one was a sterling area, and that’s the one we’re proposing and that we’re
going to be articulating and that’s what you’d expect us to do,’ Mr Salmond
replied.

‘OK Alex Salmond says there is no alternative,’ Mr Naughie
continued, before the SNP leader interrupted him and said: ‘No I didn’t say
that Jim.’

Mr Naughtie then challenged the First Minister: ‘So there is
an alternative. What is it?’

‘The fiscal commission working group set out a range of
options,’ Mr Salmond conceded.

Asked if the options were ‘off the table’, the First
Minister added: ‘They’re in the fiscal commission working group. They’re there
and have been there for the past year.’

Mr Osborne said it is clear that as Chancellor he could not recommend that the UK could share the pound with an independent Scotland

Conservative Chancellor George Osborne: The
 evidence shows it wouldn’t work. It would cost jobs and cost money and 
wouldn’t provide economic security for Scotland or for the rest of the 
UK. People need to know – that is not going to happen.'

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander: 'This isn't bluff, or bullying, it's a 
statement of fact. The SNP's claims that an independent Scotland could 
or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction.'

Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls:
 'You’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as Scotland is pulling 
away from the UK. It won’t happen, I wouldn’t recommend it. Scotland 
will not keep the pound if Scotland chooses independence.'

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling said: ‘The
penny has dropped for Alex Salmond – he knows he cannot promise the pound.

‘Alex Salmond is offering us one of two options: a rush to
join the euro or a separate unproven currency.

'Both currency options would be
bad for jobs as every time we sold to our biggest customer, England, Scottish
firms would need to pay the costs of changing currency.’

Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ‘The First
Minister has effectively conceded that the sterling currency with the UK will
not happen.

‘He pointed towards the options in his fiscal commission but
he needs to tell us which one he’d choose.

'Would it be the euro or a separate
Scottish currency? The clock is ticking.’

Owen Kelly, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise
– whose members include Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, Aviva and Standard Life –
added: ‘It is as clear as it can be at this stage, that a currency union is not
an option for an independent Scotland.

‘It would now be prudent for businesses to consider the
specific effects adopting remaining options could have on their business.’
