United were prepared prepared to let Welbeck leave for the season with new signing Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie knowingly ahead of the 23-year-old in the pecking order.

Tottenham were interested and it was initially thought that Welbeck preferred a move to White Hart Lane. 

Arsenal have now beat their arch rivals to this signing. 

WILLIAM CARVALHO LATEST

Calvalho appears to have pulled himself out of the running to join Arsenal for  £20million.

The Sporting Lisbon defender has a buy-out clause of £37m but  the Portuguese club were open to a more reasonable bid. The 22-year-old, though, announced his wish to stay put.

'I have a deal with Sporting and I am a player of Sporting,' he said. 

'My present is this club and I am feeling very good with Sporting. It really has not entered my head to leave Sporting on the last day.'

JOEL CAMPBELL LATEST

Benfica are trying to take Arsenal's out-of-favour striker Campbell on a loan or a permanent deal.

The Costa Rican is well down the pecking order and is open to leaving the Emirates before the deadline ends.

Campbell impressed at the World Cup in Brazil and scored in the thrilling 3-1 victory over Uruguay, and is keen to prove his worth on the pitch rather than on the bench.

Arsenal want to snap up a central defender before the transfer deadline - with Aston Villa's Vlaar a surprise target.
