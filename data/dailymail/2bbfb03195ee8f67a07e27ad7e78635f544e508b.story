A University of Texas at Dallas employee has been found murdered in her home after colleagues reported to police that she had failed to turn up for work.

Anna Moses, a 43-year-old divorced mother of one, was found killed inside her home in Frisco, Texas as authorities carried out a welfare check at 10.50am on Wednesday.

Police have not yet released details about how she died.

Her car, a blue 2009 Hyundai Sonata, was also missing from the house but was later found a few blocks away by patrol officers, NBC 5 reported.

'The vehicle was located unoccupied,' Officer Chad Laprelle told WFAA.

'We had detectives and crime-scene investigators respond to the location where the car was found, and currently, that vehicle is with the Frisco Police Department and they're analyzing it for evidence.' 

Detectives confirmed  that the murder seems to be an isolated incident and that they have 'strong' leads.

Colleagues, neighbors and friends expressed their shock at the death of the beloved mother. 

'The news of Anna's passing is a shock to the University community,' UT Dallas officials said in a statement on Thursday afternoon. 'Anna has worked at UT Dallas since 2005. She was well liked and respected by her colleagues, and she will be sorely missed.'

Colleagues at the university, where Moses worked as the assistant director of strategic planning and analysis at the college, had requested police to carry out the welfare check on the home.

Loss: Moses, who worked at the University of Texas at Dallas, leaves behind a college-age son

Friend Donna Ross called Moses a 'very kind, very loving, very caring, very intelligent person'.

'I can't imagine anyone wanting to harm her in any way,' she said.

Russian-born Moses divorced husband Bob Moses about two years ago but they remained friendly and continued to bring up their 20-year-old son, Igor, together.

They are both cooperating with investigators, NBC 5 reported.

A family friend said that Moses had been seeing someone but it is not yet known if investigators have spoken with him. 

Anyone in the area with any information about the crime is encouraged to contact the Frisco Police Department at 972-292-6010.
