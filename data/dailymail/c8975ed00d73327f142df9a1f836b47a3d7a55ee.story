Retired basketball star Dennis Rodman is to visit his ‘good friend’ Kim Jong-Un in North Korea for a third time this week.

Trip organisers said Mr Rodman is to make the trip despite current tension surrounding the leader’s decision to execute his uncle.

Mr Rodman has visited Pyongyang on two 
other occasions, during which he spent time dining as a guest of Kim 
Jong-Un, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship.

The visit also comes at a time when there have also been fears for the safety of the dictator’s wife, Ri Sol-Ju.

These fears were largely eased when a video was released showing her with Kim Jong-Un at a memorial service to mark the second anniversary of his father's death.

Before then, she had not been seen for a number of weeks and her absence from official photographs has led to speculation she could have fallen out of favour with a husband who is swift to deliver punishment to anyone who shows the slightest sign of disloyalty.

‘It's certainly safe, even when there 
is a bit of disruption like there is now - a bit of trouble or chaos - 
there's even more need for cultural or sporting exchanges,’ said Rory 
Scott, a spokesman for Irish bookmakers Paddy Power, which has arranged 
the trip.

In Washington, a 
State Department official, speaking anonymously, sought to
 distance the US government from Mr Rodman's visit.

‘We have not been 
contacted by Mr Rodman about his trip to North Korea,’ said the 
official. ‘The State Department does not vet U.S. citizens' private 
travel to the DPRK.’

Mr
 Rodman is expected to provide North Korea's national basketball team 
with four days of training.

He also intends to return to Pyongyang in 
January with a team of fellow former National Basketball Association 
stars to hold basketball games on Kim Jong-Un's birthday.

‘Dennis is 
going to spend a couple of days training the North Korean team to get 
them ship shape for the January match,’ Mr Scott said.

Meanwhile, North
 Korea's young dictator appears to be trying to change the 
country's history as the population mourns the death of his father.

The
 30-year-old leader has purged North Korea's state news archive, even 
removing the announcement of Kim Jong-Il's death from two years ago.

On
 Monday, thousands of North Koreans laid flowers outside the state 
mausoleum during a remembrance ceremony for their 'Dear Leader' on the 
second anniversary of his death.

After
 removing his uncle from his high position and then having him shot in 
the wake of other 'traitors of the state,' Kim Jong-Un is believed to be
 behind the country's official news agency's erasing of most of the 
state news archives.

Dumped 
from the records are some 35,000 articles held by the Korea Central News
 Agency, as well as 20,000 articles on the website of the official 
newspaper of the Workers' Party, Rodong Sinmun.

News
 of the archives purge has emerged through US website NKNews.org, for 
which Mr Frank Feinstein, a New Zealand-based analyst, tracks North 
Korea's media output.

The 
'disappearing' of historical events is seen by analysts as a further 
show of strength by Kim, who has ruled for two years since the death of 
his father, Kim Jong-Il.

Kim is believed to have decided to start history anew, with the focus being entirely on him.

Kim Jong-Un's teenage nephew has resurfaced on his university campus in Paris under police protection.

Kim Han-sol is believed to have attempted to go into hiding following the execution of Jang Song-Thaek last week.

The 19-year-old's name was removed from the postbox at prestigious social science university Sciences-Po, which saw South Korean media report that he was hiding for fear of his safety.

On Monday, Kim Han-sol was yet again seen on campus accompanied by several police officers who also partrolled the premises,  South Korean news agency Yonhap said.

The move could be an ominous sign for 
the old guard who have surrounded him.

With his uncle, Jang Song-Thaek 
being purged and then shot immediately after a show trial last week, it 
is possible that other ageing generals will also be removed to make way 
for a younger cadre.

Only 
one elderly member of Kim's immediate political team has been guaranteed
 safety from any future purge - his 67-year-old aunt, Kim Kyong-Hui, now
 the widow of Jang Song-Thaek.

The
 articles that have been removed from the KCNA website include those 
about 'major events' in the country's recent history, including the 
announcement of the death of Kim's father in 2011.

'There
 were 35,000 articles dated September 2013 or earlier on KCNA in 
Korean,' said Mr Feinstein.

'If they are leaving the 
odd one in, it is still a kill ratio of 98 per cent to 99 per cent,' he 
said in a webpost.

'This is calculated,' he added, referring to the deletions from the two sites.

'It means the order most likely came from above the individual agencies. That is why it is so interesting - it is not just an internal KCNA purge.'

It is believed that among the articles that have been removed are those suggesting regional

The 'purge period' includes North Korea's missile launches and a stream of proactive statements aimed at the US.

Now state-approved digital records about Kim Jong-Un date back to only October this year.

Mr Feinstein, who lives in Christchurch, said that in addition to the 35,000 original Korean language articles, translations in English, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese were all removed from the archives - bringing the total of deleted articles to nearly 100,000.

NKNews quoted a North Korean expert, who asked to remain anonymous, as saying that the elimination of the articles was 'an extreme action.'
