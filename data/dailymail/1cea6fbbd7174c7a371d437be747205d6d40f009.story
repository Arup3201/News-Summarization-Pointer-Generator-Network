Before getting behind the wheel of a £200,000, 200mph sports car, you might at least spare a few months of your precious life learning how to drive.

But police were unable to ascertain whether the driver of this Ferrari supercar had bothered with that small precaution, after they found he didn't have a valid driving licence.

The grey Ferrari 458 was stopped on the M40 near Bicester, Oxfordshire, after a member of the public reported a sports car driving over the speed limit.

After a traffic officers discovered the driver - who was using a German number plate - did not have a licence, he was reported to Thames Valley police and taken to the 'nearest point of safety'.

First officially unveiled in 2009, the Ferrari 458 packs a direct fuel-injection V8 engine capable of producing 458 horsepower, taking it from 0-62mph in less than three seconds.

The car, which has a top speed of 202mph, was decorated with a novelty bumper sticker pronouncing it an 'official speed camera testing vehicle'. 

It was last spotted being loaded onto a flatbed truck for the long, slow journey to the car pound.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The Ferrari was pulled over at about 9.15am this morning by junction 9 on the M40 on the northbound carriageway.

'The driver had no licence so the car was seized and he was reported for driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. 

'We used a recovery vehicle and he was dropped off at the nearest point of safety. I believe it was a Ferrari 458 with a German number plate.

'It was pulled over after a report that a sports car was driving quite quickly. We do not know if this was the same vehicle that was reported for speeding.'

Officers will now carry out a background check on the driver before deciding on their next course of action.
