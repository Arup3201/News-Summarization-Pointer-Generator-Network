While cyclists might be pleased that their lives have been made slightly easier, council chiefs clearly went a little too far in accommodating them here.

Pedestrians in Stevenage are being forced to shuffle along in single file on a tiny pavement after the council painted a giant cycle lane which occupies almost an entire footbridge.

The path markings in the Hertfordshire town appear to give cyclists an undisputed right of way, making it impossible for parents to take pushchairs over the bridge, local families said.

Over the bridge: Pedestrians in Stevenage are being forced to shuffle along in single file on a tiny pavement after the council painted a giant cycle lane which almost occupies an entire footbridge

Ignoring the lines: Local residents said the problem could have been solved by painting in one half for pedestrians and one half for cyclists

Those in wheelchairs or on mobility scooters also feel pushed to the fringes, and local residents said the problem could have been solved by painting in one half for pedestrians and one half for cyclists.

James Buhagiar, 20, a personal trainer from nearby Welwyn Garden City, said: ‘I can see what they are trying to do. The bikes used to weave in and out of the pedestrians, which was quite dangerous.

‘But all they have done is put some paint on the floor. They haven’t really thought about it. No-one is even paying any attention. The walk-way is so narrow people are having to go down one-by-one.

‘What they should have done is to make two lanes - one for bikes and one for pedestrians - on each side.’

Council response: Herts Highways has defended the confusing lines, saying they are not meant to divide pedestrians from cyclists - but rather prevent those on bikes from crashing

Luke Pygle, 26, a salesman from Potters Bar, said: ‘You would have to be pretty slim to walk within the lines. People with prams cannot fit inside the lines and mobility scooters are also struggling going over.

‘It is also quite confusing to know where you are meant to walk - if I had designed it I would have put footsteps on the walkway.’

But Herts Highways has defended the confusing lines, saying they are meant to prevent those on bikes from crashing.

A spokesman said: ‘The lines are correct and placed within the current rules and standards.

'The lines are there to stop cyclists careering into railings. Pedestrians are free to go where they like.’
