Luke Shaw has put his move to Manchester United on hold until after the World Cup to concentrate on playing for England.

The Southampton left-back wants to move to Old Trafford, but it will have to wait until after the tournament.

Shaw, who is training with the England squad in Portugal this week, said: 'It is something that is not even on my mind.

Job to do: Shaw says he was surprised to get the call up to the squad

'Transfer talk is completely gone – I am here to focus on England and England only.’

Shaw, 18, admits he was surprised to get into Roy Hodgson’s squad ahead of Ashley Cole after an outstanding season on the south coast.

He added: 'I was very surprised. With Ashley Cole not playing that many games, I thought I might have a chance. 

'But obviously he played in the last three games of the season and he played incredibly well so that made me think that maybe it might not be my turn.

'Obviously, I saw that I was announced in the squad and it was the best feeling in the world. I remember when I was sitting there with my family and friends and we were just all so proud that I am still only 18 and going to a World Cup.

'There’s no pressure – I don’t really feel pressure. I just focus on my own game. I have come here to help the England team and I will do everything I can.

'I feel ready if Leighton does pick up an injury then I will be 100 per cent ready and I don’t think Roy would have picked me if he didn’t think that.'
