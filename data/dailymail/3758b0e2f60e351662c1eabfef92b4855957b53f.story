In an era when the retirement of players from international football seems almost mandatory once they reach 30, how refreshing that some still see the honour of representing their country as the pinnacle.

At 34, Los Angeles resident Robbie Keane hardly needs the aggravation of jetting across the Atlantic to pull on the green shirt of Ireland several times a year. The current beneficiaries of his talent, LA Galaxy, are scarcely likely to be thrilled at the prospect either.

It’s not as if Keane still harbours a desire to appear at a major international competition - having book-ended his Ireland career with the 2002 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships. And, with 65 goals and 137 caps to his name, both his scoring and appearance records look safe for some time to come.

Frankly, most players in his boots would have grown weary of it all by now. When you can count Inter Milan, Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic among your former employers, the career ‘to do’ list tends to be rather on the small size.

Yet the Dubliner’s desire to achieve even more remains as strong as ever.

On Friday night, he will attempt to once again do what he does best in a place oh so familiar to him.

For Mark McGhee, a professional rivalry between Scotland and Ireland won’t impinge on his admiration for a player whose club career he launched at Wolves 17 years ago.

‘I gave Robbie his debut,’ the Scotland assistant manager recalled yesterday. ‘I always believed he could be special. Even at that age he was sensational and he’s had a sensational career.

‘I’m delighted for him. He’s a great lad and I remember the day he made his debut at Norwich. He was 17, we brought over his mum and dad and I still remember the emotion in the directors’ box when he scored the two goals. He’s a fantastic lad, a fantastic player and has had a marvellous career.’

McGhee’s own career, both as player and manager, saw him brush up against some special emerging talents. Yet, asked if the teenage Keane trumped the lot, there was hardly a shred of doubt in his reply.

‘Pretty much. I gave Emile Heskey his debut as well and he was totally different from Robbie - just a beast, a great player at that age. But Robbie, technically as a player playing against men, was just fantastic.

‘One of the things that’s impressed me about him is that over the years he has matured. He has really become a man, coming from being a kind of Jack the lad little Irish boy, to quite a serious and respected individual, captaining his country. It’s a fantastic rise. He’ll be relishing this game, going to Parkhead, that’s for sure.’ 

That’s an understatement. For the 60,000 who will cram in, there are hardly words to describe the sense of anticipation.

Not just a European Championship qualifier but a joust between two Celtic nations. Two former Celtic managers going head-to-head in the venue where they were revered. Too many sub-plots and scores to settle from club football to count. And Roy Keane to boot.

There’s so much to consider, so many colourful strands to it all, that the core business is in danger of being lost.

But McGhee offers a reality check to those members of the Tartan Army caught up in the euphoria of the upturn we’ve enjoyed under Gordon Strachan and the misguided notion that Ireland are somehow there for the taking.

‘I don’t think we’ve achieved anything yet. That (the positive mood) has still to be consolidated. We can go a long way towards doing that if we get a positive result on Friday. Equally, that can evaporate quickly. We have a lot of work to do, a long way to go.

‘Results like beating Croatia are incremental. It’s another little step towards the next step and getting a more positive attitude going into each game. It gets the players behind the manager and the fans behind the players. We are on the right track but it’s not a done deal yet.

‘We have made some progress but it has still to manifest itself in a real positive outcome and that would only be in qualifying - whether it’s beating Ireland, drawing with Poland, it’s irrelevant - the only thing that matters is qualifying. If we do that, we can say we’ve improved.’

McGhee is right. A feelgood factor has never won anybody anything and, to date, has never seen a team qualify.

Scotland have (mistakenly) basked in notions of self-worth at various junctures since France 1998 and yet the big stage has remained beyond our reach.

And yet, for all one bad result could see us deviate badly from the road to France, there’s no disputing that since winning in Zagreb there’s been something in the air.

‘We’re getting ourselves into a position where we may achieve more than recently, but the bottom line is the players have taken on Gordon’s work ethic,’ said McGhee. ‘They don’t come here to be on holiday. They come to train and work hard and we go into the games having worked as hard as you can ask any group of players.’

Without labouring the point about how dysfunctional Scotland had become under Craig Levein, there is no disputing Strachan has overseen a sea change.

‘A style had to emerge,’ McGhee said. ‘We had to have a consistent way of playing. We had to work on the same things and not chop and change. Find a way of playing that suited the players and what’ s expected of them.

‘To some degree we’ve managed that. When we play Ireland, everyone will expect to see us playing a certain way. Some days we’ll play better than others but we are playing consistently in a style that suits the players.’

It’s almost impossible to underplay the importance of a victory for either nation. Ireland’s draw in Germany indirectly winded Scotland – and rendered our brave defeat in Dortmund nigh on futile. By the time we face the world champions again in September, McGhee fully expects normal service to have been resumed.

‘I expect Germany to come back steamrolling in the second phase of the group. The fact Poland also got those three points against them changes it.

‘We might be looking at having to beat Poland at home, whereas if they hadn’t beaten Germany a draw might have done us. The best way to look at it is that we are playing Ireland and there are three points up for grabs. They are the only three points we can affect.’

The familiar personnel on both sides might make Friday’s game feel more like club selects facing each other as opposed to an international qualifier. It will be something of a battle but McGhee feels the winner of the physical contest won’t necessarily win the match.

‘In modern teams you have to be able to play and mix it. The Premier League and Championship in England are hugely physical competitions. These players play in that week in, week out and know the physical as well as the technical challenge it takes.

‘The team that manages to play well and be technical within the cauldron that will be created, will be the team which will win. The team that keeps their heads will prevail.’
