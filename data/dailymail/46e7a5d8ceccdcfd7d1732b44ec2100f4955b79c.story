The number of people taking in a lodger has almost doubled over the past few years as people look to supplement their income, according to a new study.

Research by insurance firm LV= found that the average spare room generated more than £3,000 rental a year, rising to more than £4,000 in London.

A survey of 400 UK homeowners revealed that a fifth of lodgers are aged between 36 and 50.

Around 2.7 per cent of homeowners rent out a spare room, compared with 1.4 pre cent in 2009, said the report.

The cheapest rooms for lodgers are in the Midlands and North West at just over £2,400 a year, the research found.

Rooms in Scotland earn £2,882, in East Anglia £2,748, in the North East £2,667 and in Wales £2,611. 

The average spare room is being let within eight days of being advertised, while one in ten people taking in a lodger have had their property damaged, said the report. 

And because of the housing shortage and spiraling house prices, lodgers are no longer students but becoming older with the average age now increased to 31. 

Landlords said getting a good rental income was the main motivation for renting out a room with a third using rent money to help with the bills while a quarter add it to their savings or to have more disposable income.

But it is not all plain sailing with one in 12 landlords owed rent by their lodger or a previous tenant and on average being £307 out of pocket.

Nearly a third of landlords owed rent said their lodger simply left without paying, while the same proportion said their current tenant never pays on time.

Many landlords admit if lodgers are a friend or family member it was hard to establish a commercial relationship and less than half of all landlords ask for a deposit.  

The research also found that a lodger can make a home more vulnerable to accidental damage and theft.

A fifth of landlords have returned home to find appliances, such as the oven, left on unattended and one in seven has had their belongings damaged.

One in six have noticed that windows have been left open while the home was unoccupied, and one in ten said their home was not locked properly.

Three fifths of landlords said they don’t always check references and a third haven’t updated their insurance since taking in a lodger, potentially leaving themselves out of pocket should the worst happen.

Selwyn Fernandes, Managing Director of LV= home insurance which carried out the survey said: 'While renting out a room to lodgers can be a great source of income, homeowners might be unwittingly invalidating their home insurance, leaving property and possessions at risk.

'All those considering taking in a lodger should vet potential tenants carefully and make sure they have suitable insurance in place.'
