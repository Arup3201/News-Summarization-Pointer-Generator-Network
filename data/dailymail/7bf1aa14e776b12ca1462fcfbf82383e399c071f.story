Neymar's recovery from the back injury he suffered at the World Cup is continuing apace as the Barcelona forward enjoys a holiday with girlfriend Bruna Marquezine in Spain.

The couple are relaxing on the beaches in Ibiza as the Brazil star - complete with spinal support - completes his rehabilitation.

Neymar
 was ruled out of his country's dismal final two matches at their home 
tournament after injuring his back in the quarter-final against 
Colombia.

Brazil went on 
to be humiliated 7-1 against eventual champions Germany without him, before limping 
to a 3-0 defeat in the third-place play-off against Holland.

Neymar
 will link up with new striker Luis Suarez at Barcelona, with the 
Spanish media reporting that he'll form a partnership with the 
Uruguayan, with talisman Lionel Messi playing in the No 10 role.

The forward signed for Barcelona last summer, where he went on to score nine goals in 26 La Liga appearances.

However, his stock rose during the World Cup and, in the trio named above, Barca have enough flair and firepower to compete with Real Madrid's formidable front line.
