The mother of Trayvon Martin spoke out Sunday against the stop-and-frisk police practice in New York City, saying neither police nor civilians have the right to stop someone because of their race.Critics say the stops target black and Hispanic people who aren't doing anything wrong. Earlier this week, a judge told New York City that its policy was racial discrimination. The city plans to appeal.

'You can't give people the authority, whether civilian or police officers, the right to just stop somebody because of the color of their skin,' Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton said on NBC's Meet the Press.

Bereaved: Sybrina Fulton appeared on NBC's Meet the Press to speak out against the stop-and-frisk policy that she says is racial profiling

Victim: Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by self-appointed neighborhood watch rep George Zimmerman as he walked home last year in what supporters say was a case of racial profiling

Over the past decade, New York police have stopped, questioned and sometimes patted down about five million people; 87 per cent were black or Hispanic.

About 10 per cent of the stops spur an arrest or summons.

Police find weapons a fraction of the time.

Racial targeting: Fulton's lawyer Benjamin Crump (right) said that the stop-and-frisk policy targets people based on the color of their skin

Fulton's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the stop-and-frisk policy targeted people by race and noted it was still being used as the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I have a dream' speech approached.'It actually takes us away from his poignant words of, "I dreamed my children would be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin,"' Crump said.

Healing: Sybrina Fulton is trying to create positive action following her son's death by fighting against gun violence

Fulton has said neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman 'got away with murder' in the 2012 killing of her son, largely because of Florida's self-defense law.Protesters had been occupying part of the Capitol in Tallahassee, calling for an examination of the Florida law since Zimmerman was acquitted last month.

Zimmerman claimed self-defense in shooting the 17-year-old Martin during a fight; Martin's supporters say Zimmerman profiled and followed him because Martin was black.
