Kerry Smith has quit as Ukip's candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments.

In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.

They were revealed just days after he was reinstated as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock.

He initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong pain killers.

He blamed the rant on 'strong morphine based prescription medication for a back injury'.  

But in a statement, he said: 'I have this evening offered my resignation as Ukip PPC for South Basildon and East Thurrock.

'I want the best for South Basildon and East Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people.

'Therefore I have chosen to resign so that Ukip can win this seat next May.'

Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn had earlier tried to play down the revelations - claiming they were 'hand grenades rolling down the corridor'

Earlier, Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn had said: 'This was a phone call sometime ago while he was on sedatives by his own account, not really speaking, thinking rationally. He was on prescription sedatives after suffering an injury.'

But he said: 'Using derogatory terminology, this slang, is not right at this level of politics and you shouldn't do it.'

'Clearly what he said there is unacceptable. He's apologised unreservedly, there are big mitigating circumstances, it's from some time ago, and we're willing now to judge him on his performance going forward from this.'

The row came after a Ukip official charged with vetting the party's election candidates revealed he spends half his time 'weeding out the lunatics'.

David Soutter told Ukip activists he was not able to spend enough time finding good new candidates – because he was too busy getting rid of people 'who shouldn't be there'.

In recorded comments passed to the Sunday Times, Mr Souter said the party needed to become more disciplined,

He said: 'One of the things that Ukip has lacked as a party — and looking at it the way I've been able to from the outside — discipline is one of the things that's really been missing.

'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.'

Mr Soutter had even resorted to 'doing tests to make sure people were vaguely sane and that they could string their words together more or less', Ukip's Scottish MEP David Coburn said.
