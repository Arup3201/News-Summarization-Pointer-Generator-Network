The global Ebola death toll has risen to almost 5,000.

And as humanitarian efforts ramp up, US roboticists and government groups are planning a summit to discuss how robots could be the key to curbing the spread of the disease.

During a series of events in November, these experts will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis.

During a series of events in November, roboticists will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis. For example, germ-killing robot 'Little Moe' (pictured) is designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes, and is being used to keep hospitals Ebola-free

The first talk will be co-hosted by the Texas A&M University’s Centre for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), on 7 November, led by professor of computer science and engineering Robin Murphy.

Simultaneous events will be also be held by the White House of Science and Technology Policy, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of California, Berkeley.

In a blog post, Professor Murphy outlined nine ways robots could play a role in stopping the Ebola outbreak.

These included mortuary robots, to transport the deceased, robots that can detect and disinfect rooms, ambulances and houses that have held infected people, as well as ‘rolling interpreters’ to help translate between aid workers, doctors and patients.

Other robots that will be discussed including drones that can deliver food and medicine (DHL's Parcelcopter is pictured)

Automated trucks could also deliver aid. In February, the US Army tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in Fort Hood Texas (pictured). The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland

For example, a germ-killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals Ebola-free.

Called 'Little Moe', the robot works by damaging viral DNA using pulses of ultraviolet light.

It is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the US, including a Dallas hospital where a patient with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in America was being treated.

Similarly, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre have created ‘Violet’ – a robot that emits ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potentially Ebola.

Professor Robin Murphy proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease. These include: 

Mortuary robots: These would respectfully transport the deceased, because Ebola is most virulent at the time of death, and immediately following death

Robot replacements for health professionals: Robots that could be used in biosafety labs and field hospitals, for tasks such as automated materials handling and remote patient care.

Detection of contamination: Robots that scour vehicles, rooms, buildings and even public spaces for signs of the disease ambulance or house have Ebola

Disinfection: Robots that open the drawers and doors for the commercially available Little Moe disinfectant robot

Professor Robin Murphy proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease. These include Mortuary robots that would transport the deceased, and reconnaisance drones and bots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions (iRobot 510 PackBot is pictured)

Telepresence robots: Experts could use such robots to consult and advise on medical issues, train and supervise worker decontamination, and serve as 'rolling interpreters' for the different languages and dialects.

Physical security: Robotic guards to protect workers during riots, as those seen in Sierra Leone.

Waste handling: Robots that transport biowaste from infected sites.

Humanitarian relief: This includes autonomous food trucks and drones that deliver food and medicine.

Reconnaissance: Drones and other types of robots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions 

All of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments.

Other ideas include autonomous food trucks and delivery drones, as well as reconnaissance and telepresence robots.

Logistics firm DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post, is planning to send 'parcelcopters' flying at up to 40mph (65km/h) to the car-free island of Juist, off Germany's northern coast.

Text messages are currently helping in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone, with people receiving public health text alerts and sending messages about food security to aid agencies (pictured). Experts could use similar services to consult and advise on medical issues and train and supervise worker decontamination

The global Ebola death toll has risen to almost 5,000. Ebola (pictured) emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo.There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent

The drone is designed to deliver medication and other urgently needed goods to the island at times when other modes of transport are not operating.

Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent.

In the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent. It is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy.

The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people.

Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days.

Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down.

If the trial is successful, the craft could be used to deliver packages to other remote areas, or in emergencies such as during the Ebola crisis.

In February, the US Army tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in Fort Hood Texas.

The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland. 

Each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections, oncoming traffic, stalled and passing vehicles, pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas.

The autonomous vehicles were part of the Army and Marine Corps’ Autonomous Mobility Appliqué System (AMAS) program.

The successful convoy was the final stage of the program’s Capabilities Advancement Demonstration.

‘In order to be successful at any one of the tasks, robots have to meet a lot of hidden requirements and sometimes the least exciting or glamorous job can be of the most help to the workers,’ explained Professor Murphy.

‘Can an isolated field hospital handle a heavy robot in the muddy rainy season? How will the robots be transported there? 

'Is it easy enough for the locals to use so that they can be engaged and earn a living wage? What kind of network communication is available? What if it needs repairs?

‘That’s what I am working on, applying the lessons learned in robotics for meteorological and geological disasters.’

Texas A&M students will also be creating prototype aid robots as part of the Aggies Invent ‘What Would You Build for a First Responder’ event this weekend, while graduate students will be students designing and simulating intelligent robots.

CRASAR is additionally planning to host another workshop to share the results of their current research into specific use cases with the robotics community in January. 

This year has seen the worst outbreak in history of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). This scene shows bodies being taken away in Sierra Leone. Professor Robin Murphy from Texas A&M University claims that this high death toll requires so-called mortuary robots to transport the deceased
