Paris continues to be a source of joie de vivre for Warren Gatland as Wales secured a fourth successive victory over France to keep alive their RBS 6 Nations hopes.

The local papers identified Leigh Halfpenny as ‘La Menace’ of the Welsh team and the boy from Gorseinon provided the kicks that proved the difference.

Gatland missed his side’s victory in the French capital two years ago but the Kiwi travelled back across the Channel with his side building momentum and still in for a late charge for the championship .

Leigh Halfpenny was key for Wales with his kicking, and he scored all six of their points in a tight first half before adding nine in the second

The hosts started well with a crunching tackle on Liam Williams and a clinical turnover by Eddy Ben Arous, but Wales were undeterred. The visitors attacked the gain-line, with Jamie Roberts making hard yards off No 10, and played through 11 phases before Halfpenny was awarded a kickable penalty to open the scoring in the seventh minute.

Les Bleus’ play had revolved around crash-ball merchant Mathieu Bastareaud but by naming the 19st 12lb centre on the bench, Philippe Saint-Andre had signalled a wider and more open approach. It was a chance for Remi Lamerat, who has been identified by Racing Metro as a potential replacement for Roberts, but he lasted just 18 minutes and, as Camille Lopez lined up a kick to level the scores, Bastareaud was given a rousing reception by the sell-out crowd.

Wales knew that a powerful start would silence the Parisian audience and a scuffed 25th-minute penalty by Lopez was a let-off. Assisted by a defence-splitting kick from Davies, Wales were able to clear their lines and move play into opposition territory. The scrum looked unconvincing on a churning pitch but, with the skills of Toby Faletau at the base, still provided a platform to attack.

Rather than crash through the middle, the ball went out wide to George North off first phase and France conceded a penalty at the subsequent breakdown. With his usual pinpoint accuracy, Halfpenny took full advantage of the three points. It was advantage Wales but, with Bastereaud playing a key role in the French phases, they almost struck straight back. Yoann Huget finished clinically in the corner, but his score was chalked off for a forward pass.

France were unfortunate not to be level at half-time after Lopez shanked another penalty just before the break. 

His half-back partner and club team-mate, Morgan Parra, takes the kicks for Clermont but the scrum-half too was off target when he took over the duties.

They attacked the Welsh line through Wesley Fofana, but again left empty handed after play was called back for crossing.

Wales fell foul of the law soon after when Alun-Wyn Jones failed to roll away from the tackle and France drew level with Lopez’s kick.

When France collapsed a driving maul, Halfpenny was able to edge his team back in front with the kick. 

Then North, becoming the youngest ever player to reach 50 caps, broke through the defence and Rhys Webb was allowed to snipe down the side of the breakdown.

The scrum-half found Dan Lydiate with his offload and Dan Biggar switched play to touch down in the corner on the stroke of the hour. 

Halfpenny missed the conversion but he was on hand with a penalty shortly after to give his side an 11-point cushion.

Brice Dulin crossed in the 67th minute but, despite a fine conversion from Lopez, it was to be Wales’ night as Halfpenny kept the scoreboard ticking.
