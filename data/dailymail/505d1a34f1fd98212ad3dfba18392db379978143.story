Randy Allen Taylor, 48, who has been charged in connection with missing teen Alexis Murphy, may have links with Samantha Clarke, 19, who is also missing

The suspect in the case of missing teenager Alexis Murphy may be linked to the disappearance of another teenage girl, a lawyer has said.

Randy Taylor, 48, has been charged with the abduction of the missing 17-year-old Alexis, who has was last spotted by a camera in Lovingston, Nelson County, at a gas station where Taylor was also spotted.

While Alexis, a student at Nelson County High School, has not yet been found, investigators are also looking at the case of Samantha Clarke, 19, who has been missing from her home in neighboring Orange County for three years.

Orange County commonwealth's attorney Diane Wheeler said Taylor was the last person known to have had contact with Miss Clarke before she disappeared on September 13 2010.

A graduate of Orange County High School, Miss Clarke had told her brother she was going out for the evening but never returned.

Ms Wheeler told the Huffington Post: 'He was the person who last had contact with her ... He had multiple contacts with her in the days immediately preceding her disappearance...

'The investigation is still continuing and he remains a person of interest to us.'

Taylor is being held at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail after he was arrested on Monday on suspicion of abduction by force.

He appeared in court yesterday on the felony charge and investigators are currently examining his camo-wrapped car and a camper found at his home near Lovingston.

Unlike Miss Clarke, Alexis is not thought to have known Taylor.

Her last Twitter entry at 6.40pm on August 3 read: 'I actually look cute right now' and she was later picked up by the gas station CCTV camera at 7.15pm.

Three days later police found Miss Aleixs' abandoned Nissan in Charlottesville, 39 miles from the gas station.

They are also looking at footage said to show Taylor in Ultimate Bliss, an adult store two miles from where the Nissan was found, on the day Alexis went missing.

One man has told how he saw Taylor sitting in his vehicle in the Lovingston Food Lion parking lot, opposite the gas station where Alexis was seen.

Bruce Johnson told a reporter he had seen the suspect watching people from inside his suburban.

He told NBC29.com: 'He was just sitting in that parking lot watching and that kind of was strange to me...

'A suburban with antennas on it, camouflage down the side of it - that's kind of suspicious because I've never seen that vehicle around here before.'

Taylor is next due in court in January for a preliminary hearing.
