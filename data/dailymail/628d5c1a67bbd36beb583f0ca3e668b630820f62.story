They were hired at a cost of more than £140,000 by a cash-strapped police force to reassure a concerned public that laying-off 500 officers as part of swingeing £50million cuts would not harm the fight against crime.

But Sussex Police's controversial decision to recruit five spin doctors while simultaneously slashing the number of frontline officers has provoked new outrage after their communications manager used her official Twitter account to Tweet pictures of cakes.

Sarah Gillespie wrote: ‘A typical Friday in Corporate Comms!’ alongside a picture of office desks loaded with sweet treats.

Priorities: Communication manager Sarah Gillespie has provoked anger after using her official Sussex Police twitter account to discuss cakes rather than crime prevention

In March Sussex Police claimed they were advertising for new posts to maintain their ‘popular website’, ‘teach officers to use Twitter’ and sell the idea of cuts to its workforce.

She is one of three divisional managers in a team of 20 communications staff.

The force has come under fire after it emerged the rest of the force was in the middle of a £50 million cost-cutting programme involving the loss of 500 officers and 550 other staff.

All the jobs advertised had salaries of between £25,449 and £28,107.

Robert Oxley from the Taxpayers Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will think they are better off served by police officers rather than press officers.

‘With Police forces under pressure to find necessary savings, it’s incredible that Sussex has the money to expand its cake-tweeting comms department but has cut the number of front line officers.

‘Police chiefs need to get their priorities straight, that means bobbies on the beat not spin doctors who tweet.’

The force’s corporate communications 
and public engagement department has a £1.1 million annual budget - a 
reduction of £16,000 since the cuts began last year.

The
force said it was not recruiting any extra staff but replacing five 
posts because of departures, maternity leave and role changes.

A spokesman for Sussex Police said when the recruitment drive was first publicised, said: ‘Keeping the public well informed and using communications to enhance operational policing are ongoing priorities for us.

‘The corporate communications and public engagements and public engagement department carries out a wide range of tasks from witness appeals about murders and updates during large policing events to maintaining our popular website and advising on the best ways to communicate in local areas.

‘A small team of specialists provides these services in the most effective way, rather than others in the force being abstracted from their own work.’

He said the department is not growing and the recruitment was caused by departures and maternity leave. Three of the posts are temporary.

A Sussex Police spokesman said today: 'The 
photo was posted by one of our staff, via her own phone and on to what 
was then her own Twitter account, during her lunch break.

'The contents of that account have since been automatically added to what is now her official force Twitter account.

'It
is not unknown for staff in all walks of life to bring cakes into the 
office. This particular occasion marked the departure of two staff from 
the Department.

'There has been no increase in the size of the Department, the budget for which has decreased in the past year.'

The controverail recruitment last year was greeting with mixed opinion by some of those hoping to stand for election as the country’s first police and crime commissioner in November.

Conservative Peter Jones, leader of East Sussex County Council, said: ‘Police, like everybody else, need to communicate effectively with the public.

‘However in those terms, when frontline police officer posts are under pressure I think we need to take a careful look at the level of press establishment.’

Labour Paul Richards said: ‘You need people to be able to tell the public how their money is being spent.’

Ian Chisnall, who intends to stand as an independent candidate said: ‘I would err on the side that more communications are better than less communications but obviously there has to be a sense of proportion with it all.

‘If one department was growing fat while everyone else was on rations that then becomes a risk that the people you want to do the communications become the story.’
