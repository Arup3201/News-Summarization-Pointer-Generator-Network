A heartbroken family has revealed how a popular amateur footballer died with a tear in his eye, weeks after developing locked-in syndrome.

Bryan Herbert was left aware and awake but almost completely paralysed and unable to talk since suffering a stroke.

He died on Tuesday night surrounded by his loved ones.

Tragedy: Bryan Herbert was left aware and awake but almost completely paralysed and unable to talk since suffering a stroke. He initially suffered a fit more than two months ago after playing for his local team

His mother Alicia said: 'He had a tear in his eye and knew he was going on Tuesday. He will be missed by a lot of people.'

Bryan’s family, all from Bacup, Lancashire said he initially suffered a fit more than two months ago after playing for Stacksteads St Joseph’s football team, which he captained.

Around three weeks later the former All Saints High School pupil, who also played for Bacup Borough and The Little Queen’s pub in Bacup, woke up sweating, feeling unwell and unable to move his whole left side.

By the time paramedics arrived Bryan wasn’t 
able to talk and was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, pictured, where he 
remained in the critical care unit for several weeks before he passed away

By the time paramedics arrived he wasn’t able to talk and was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, where he remained in the critical care unit for five weeks.

His girlfriend, parents, brothers and sisters said their final goodbyes to the 27-year-old during ten emotional minutes medics granted them after revealing nothing could be done to save him.

Vicky Bruty, 25, described her beloved boyfriend as the ‘complete life and soul of the party’ before the stroke. She said: 'He was everything and loved us all. The last conversation we had as a couple was over two months ago - the day before we were going on holiday.

'We talked about living together. He said how much he loved me and how we would start a family when we got home.

'But he suffered a stroke before we left and had been in hospital ever since.'

His father Gary, who turned 48 this week, said Bryan started improving two weeks ago as he lay in hospital.

He said: 'He was ‘locked in’ from day one, kept crying and couldn’t talk to us at any point. They found a lump in the back of his neck immediately and it got bigger.'

Gary said that despite Bryan moving his arms and legs a bit and even laughing two weeks ago, his son took a turn for the worse on Monday this week.

He added: 'He suddenly needed a tube down his throat to help him breathe. And they found more damage to his brain.

'It is distressing. You don’t want to see your kids die before you. In the ten minutes we got with him everyone just started either crying or feeling numb with pain. And we all said our goodbyes.'

Paying tribute to his son, Gary added: 'He was a smashing lad who loved football, Liverpool FC, fishing, snooker and poker.

'Hundreds of people attended a fundraiser at the New Con Club in Bacup for him two weeks ago.'

The former St Mary’s Primary School pupil had also been a chef at the Cobblers Inn, where he’d met his girlfriend Vicky. He lived on Clough Road in Bacup with his mother.

Bacup Borough manager Brent Peters said Bryan’s legacy will always remain with the club.

He said: 'Bryan will be a sad loss, not only to his close family but his football family.'

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned by a coroner.
