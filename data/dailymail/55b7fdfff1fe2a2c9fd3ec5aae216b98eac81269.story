Lingerie brand Ultimo is setting up shop for the first time, marking brand new territory for the retailer.

The lingerie brand opens a concession section in Glasgow's House of Fraser today, allowing shoppers to be fitted and try different shapes, colours and styles before purchasing in the Ultimo 'store within a store'.

Glamorous founder Michelle Mone OBE attended the launch in the department store last night joined by a host of local celebrities and guests to celebrate her company's new move.

She said: ''We are delighted to launch Ultimo in one of the most prestigious department stores in Glasgow. 

'We have carefully selected a collection of Ultimo lingerie that we're confident will appeal to House of Fraser customers and we can't wait to welcome shoppers into store.

'This is the very first store of 12, so it's a real milestone moment for Ultimo - and extra special for me being in my home town of Glasgow.'  

The stylish new 'shop' offers the brand's full range of fashion, solution and bridal lingerie collections, in premium boutique-style surroundings.

While Ultimo designs are already sold in Harrods, Next and Debenhams, this is the first concession store fully staffed by Ultimo assistants.

'It's a fuller brand experience,' says a spokesperson, 'a "shop in shop" rather than a department store with a gondola of our product.'

The House of Fraser Glasgow outpost is one of 12 scheduled concessions to be opened in the next six months

The launch is the first of 12 concessions scheduled to open in the next six months before the brand considers standalone shops. 

A spokesperson for House of Fraser, Glasgow, said: 'We are proud to welcome such a globally esteemed Scottish lingerie brand as Ultimo to our Glasgow House of Fraser store where we always seek to deliver premium product.' 

The new store has been designed by global retail design agency Design4Retail, who have previously designed retail solutions for brands including Cath Kidston, Clarins, Clinique, and Adidas.  

The latest Ultimo ranges are available in sizes 30-38 A-DD, from £10 for briefs and £20 for bras.
