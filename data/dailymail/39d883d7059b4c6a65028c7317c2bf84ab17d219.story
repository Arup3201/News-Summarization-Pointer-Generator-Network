Neil Lennon is the new favourite to land the Bolton job after jumping to the top of chairman Phil Gartside’s shortlist.

The former Celtic manager will renew talks with the Championship club on Saturday and looks set to beat off a number of stellar candidates, including Chris Hughton, to the post.

Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman last month.

Neil Lennon is the new favourite to land the vacant manager's job at Championship strugglers Bolton

Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell.

He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah.

Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development.

The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and there’s every chance he could take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week.

Bolton parted company with Dougie Freedman last month after a dismal run of results in the second tier 

His name is also under consideration at fellow Championship strugglers Fulham but with caretaker manager Kit Symons steadying the ship at Craven Cottage, Lennon is more likely to become a rival rather than their would-be saviour.

A former Manchester City player, Lennon has maintained his links with the north-west of England and would relish the chance to write the next chapter of his managerial career there.

His four years in the Celtic hot-seat brought three successive league titles, two Scottish Cups and qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.
