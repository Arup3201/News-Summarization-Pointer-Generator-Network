The first part of Lance Armstrong's doping confession to Oprah Winfrey drew about 4.3 million viewers to Winfrey's struggling television network on Thursday night, according to Nielsen ratings.

The number - roughly the same as Good Morning America's daily audience - is good news for OWN, Winfrey's network, but it hardly compares to big interviews from her days of yore, such as the 1993 Michael Jackson that attracted 62 million viewers to ABC.

During her peak in the early 90s, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' drew an average 13 million viewers, according to the New York Times.

Lance Armstrong has responded to claims that he was not totally frank in his exchange with Oprah Winfrey during which he admitted taking performance enhancing drugs

Winfrey was counting on her popularity to follow her to her new network in January 2011, but she has had 
trouble getting the channel off the ground.

She was hoping that her interview with Armstrong would serve as a turning point in the network's trajectory, but it failed to impress.

About 3.17 million people tuned in for the first airing of the interview at 9 p.m. on Thursday, and another 1.12 million tuned in for the repeat airing at 10:30 p.m. The channel says another couple hundred thousand people watched the interview via live stream online, as well.

Previously, Winfrey's interview with Bobby Kristina, the daughter of Whitney Houston, held the two-year-old network's record for drawing the highest number of viewers. That interview, aired in March of 2012, drew 3.5 million viewers to the channel.

With the Armstrong interview spread over two 
nights and not one - as originally planned - OWN has been selling 
advertising space at premium prices and expected to set record viewing figures.

In the interview, Armstrong, who she interviewed on Monday, admitted to using banned performance-enhancing drugs during his professional cycling career that included seven Tour de France titles.

The cyclist had vehemently denied doping for more than a decade.

OWN planned to air one episode with Armstrong but expanded the program to two nights after the cyclist talked with Winfrey for more than two hours.

The interview is generating a wave of publicity for OWN.

Confession: Lance Armstrong admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey this week

In 2012, OWN's primetime ratings rose 32 percent over the previous year among its target audience of women aged 25 to 54, according to data from the network.

OWN averaged 147,000 viewers aged 25 to 54 during primetime in 2012, according to Nielsen data provided by Horizon Media.

A chunk of ad time for the Armstrong interview was pre-sold to regular advertisers of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' a weekly show where she sits down with big-name stars and newsmakers such as reality TV's Kardashian family and rapper Usher.

The remaining commercial time is being sold in the final days leading up to the telecasts in the 'scatter' market, which commands higher prices than the pre-sold rates.

Thanks to growing interest in Armstrong's comments, OWN is securing a premium over the usual scatter rates for 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' Logan said.

'I left it all on the table with her and when it airs the people can decide,' he said in a text message to The Associated Press

'We are seeing the premiums' on ad rates, he said, but declined to provide specific figures.

The network is giving priority to advertisers who have bought time on the show in the past and those that will also commit to other shows, he said.

Ongoing OWN sponsors include General Motors Co, Target Corp, and Kellogg Co .

OWN scored some of its biggest audiences with Winfrey's celebrity interviews.

Her March 2012 talk with Whitney Houston's daughter shortly after the singer's sudden death drew 3.5 million viewers. Singer Rihanna's appearance in August 2011 grabbed 2.5 million viewers.

Winfrey, in an appearance on 'CBS This Morning,' said Armstrong 'didn't come clean in the manner that I expected.'

Lance Armstrong's interview with Oprah was the most eagerly anticipated event for her fledgling OWN network

'I think the most important questions 
and the answers that people around the world have been waiting to hear 
were answered,' she said.

Armstrong stopped at the Livestrong 
Foundation, which he founded, on his way to the interview and said, 'I'm
sorry' to staff members, some of whom broke down in tears.

A person 
with knowledge of that session said Armstrong choked up and several 
employees cried during the session.

The person also said Armstrong 
apologized for letting the staff down and putting Livestrong at risk but
he did not make a direct confession to using banned drugs.

He said he would try to restore the 
foundation's reputation, and urged the group to continue fighting for 
the charity's mission of helping cancer patients and their families.

Rae Bazzarre, a spokeswoman for Livestrong said it was emotional 'but we were all glad to see him.'

Armstrong
had not been at the headquarters since October 21, Ms Bazzarre said, 
about two weeks before he resigned from Livestrongâ€™s board of directors.

USADA chief executive Travis Tygart 
labeled the doping regimen allegedly carried out by the U.S. Postal 
Service team that Armstrong once led, 'The most sophisticated, 
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever 
seen.'
