More than 150,000 Lynda Bellingham fans have a joined a campaign to bring back her classic Oxo TV advert - to pay tribute to her wish for one last family Christmas.

The stock cube firm is considering whether to run the 1984 clip My Christmas on December 25 in memory of the actress, whose death prompted an outpouring of tributes  last week.

In her final TV interview she told of her excitement at spending her last Christmas with her family - ditching the apron of her screen appearances for a napkin in a nearby hotel.

Final Christmas: Oxo is 'reviewing' whether to air the 1984 TV advert My Christmas (pictured) in memory of the late actress Lynda Bellingham, who played the much-loved mother of the family for more than 15 years

Beloved: A spokesman for Oxo said no decision had been made yet after a campaign by 150,000 fans

'I've succumbed to not cooking it and I thought poor Michael [her husband], we can't put him through that again,' she told ITV's Loose Women.

'So we're going to go to a hotel for the meal, but just my little bit of control, we're going to go home for pudding and presents.'

The Facebook campaign group, set up after the actress lost her battle with colon cancer, was called 'Bring back the Oxo Christmas advert in memory of Lynda Bellingham' and has gained more than 150,000 fans.

Some fans of the 66-year-old actress have called on ITV to screen the advert free of charge while others have taking to donating to Cancer Research UK in her memory.

One, Anne Sheridan, wrote: 'Let Linda have her Christmas. She will always be the Oxo mum xxx'.

Another, Jan Fravigar, added: 'It would be lovely, but what about her family how would they feel seeing her at Christmas, for me would be very hard.'

A spokesman for Premier Foods, which runs the Oxo brand, said it was a 'highly sensitive issue' and the firm is 'reviewing the situation'. 'No decision has been made yet,' he said.

Brave face: In her final TV interview the actress said she was looking forward to a family Christmas

The spokesman explained: 'Lynda was a fabulous actress with a career spanning many years.

'She will always be remembered as the OXO mum but we don't wish to overshadow all the other inspiring things she did with her life and career by focusing solely on our adverts.

'For the past two years we have partnered with MacMillan Cancer Support, one of the charities supported by Lynda, to raise more than £250,000 to help families affected by cancer and we will continue to support this valuable cause.

'The adverts can be found on YouTube for anyone who would like to revisit them.'

ITV has been contacted for comment. 

Fans of the actress lined up to pay heartfelt tributes after her death on Sunday, October 19. 

Among those remembering her were Prince Charles - who said she was a 'marvellous actress' and he backed her push to get more older people into work.

The Prince of Wales said he was 'greatly saddened' by her death from cancer, praising her 'tireless' work for other people.

Mrs Bellingham was best known for playing mother in the Oxo Christmas adverts from 1983 to 1999, as each year her family grew up around her. She was also a presenter on Loose Women, where her final interview attracted an audience of 2million - double its usual figure.

She was diagnosed with colon cancer only in July this year, and the disease later spread to her lungs and liver.

For two years she had been an ambassador for the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (Prime) which helps the over-50s start their own companies.

A food artist has created a portrait of the late Lynda Bellingham entirely out of Oxo cubes - the food she spent more than 15 years advertising on TV.

Fine art graduate Nathan Wyburn, 25, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, created the tribute by putting beef stock cubes in water and painting the mixture onto a canvas.

The work by Mr Wyburn, whose specialises in creating celebrity images using food and household items, took around two hours to complete. 

Fitting tribute: Artist Nathan Wyburn created this portrait in Lynda Bellingham's memory using Oxo cubes

'I wanted to create a fitting and respectful tribute to Lynda, and thought it was only appropriate to use Oxo cubes,' he said.

Other pieces of work by the artist have included portraits of William and Kate made out of crackers, and images of Joey Essex and Katie Price painted in fake tan.

'The work was great fun to create,' he said. 'I love using food as an art medium, there’s so many colours, textures and even smells that make the portraits quite unique.'
