Images from the archive of a tiny Cambridge computer lab show the incredible technological revolution that has taken place over a single generation.

From the world's first programmable computer, created in 1949, to the chunky first calculator with huge buttons and a chip that led to the iPad - the Cambridge lab has pioneered it all.

And as the lab this year celebrates its 75th anniversary, this collection shows the effect a two man team, set up in 1938 has had on millions worldwide.

Even before it revolutionised the world with the first programmable computer, the lab was the first to use London firm Modivo's electric calculating machine, shown in a picture from the lab's archive below.

The lab was initially home to some very basic machines such as this early electric calculating machine, which was built by London firm Moldivo, but used at the Lab. With over 100 buttons, it was capable of Multiplication, Automatic Division, Addition and Subtraction. At the time the lab was created, computing was done by people, often mathematically gifted young women who carried out tedious numerical calculations by hand

Founded in the 1938 as the University of Cambridge’s Mathematical Laboratory with just two men based in an old Anatomy School, the lab was today hailed by Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt of Google as instrumental in the technological revolution.

It was one of the first customers of electric calculator, but staff soon invented EDSAC, the first programmable computer ever brought into general service.

Users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper, and the room sized machine measured 5m by 2m - a far cry from today's handheld gadgets.

EDSAC was the first of many technological breakthroughs at the lab, including the computer password, the webcam (developed so engineers could get fresh coffee), the BBC Micro and the ARM chip that powers dozens of smartphones and tablets, including Apple's iPad.

EDSAC was first introduced in 1949 when it completed its first programmed task by accurately calculating the squares of numbers from 0 to 99.

Andy Hopper, professor of computer technology and current head of the lab, said: 'I believe that we are completely unique and that there is no other department in the world quite like us.

'Cambridge is the place where computers became a tool for general use, and the qualities that made that possible have never left us.

'They made us the biggest wealth conversion engine in the Cambridge cluster and therefore in Europe.

'And they have enabled us to achieve more than any other computer science department in the world.'

In contrast with its humble beginnings, the centre is now home to dozens of staff and hundreds of students and is credited with giving rise to almost 200 technology firms.

Founded in the 1938 as the University
of Cambridge’s Mathematical Laboratory with just two men based in an 
old Anatomy School, the centre grew to become a world leader and is this
week celebrating its anniversary.

Over
the decades it has been responsible for developments which contributed 
to the rise of early home computers and the low power chips used in 
mobile phones and iPads.

The
'Mathematical Laboratory' began life as a two-man team, confined to the
Anatomy School’s North Wing, and was charged with providing a resource 
for solving complex problems by 'numerical methods'.

When
John Lennard-Jones, a Theoretical Chemist who was to become its first 
Director, submitted proposals for a computing facility in 1936, the idea
was described as 'extraordinary'.

At
the time, a 'computer' was a person, very frequently a mathematically 
gifted woman, employed to carry out tedious numerical calculations by 
hand.

Lennard-Jones’
visionary proposal was for a facility that would carry out complicated 
calculations in support of wider University research, with the human 
computers using 'recent developments in mechanical and electrical aids 
to computation'.

The 
Lab’s early hardware consisted of these machines, and two analog 
computers which were designed to solve linear differential equations.

Titan was the prototype of the Atlas 2 computer, and was designed starting in 1963, and in operation from 1964 to 1973. One of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse Fourier Transforms of data from the One-Mile Radio Telescope.

The first passwords: The CAP computer was the first successful experimental computer that demonstrated the use of security capabilities, both in hardware and software. It first became operational in 1976, using tokens or keys to allow users to access files and other information on the system. It greatly improved the security of computing at the lab.

The team then went on to address the problem of security, inventing what was in effect the first computer password system.

One famous by-product of the lab’s 
work came when a team of researchers who shared the same coffee pot had 
decided to keep tabs on whether it was full or not.

The Trojan Room coffee pot was located in the corridor just outside the so-called Trojan Room within the old Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge.

However, engineers became bored of pointless trips to the coffee room - and decided a technological solution was the answer.

They utilised a spare computer to create, on the user's desktop computer, a live 128×128 grayscale picture of the state of the coffee pot.

They later created a version in a browser window, becoming the world’s first web cam.

The invention was eventually used by others, and paved the way for the explosion in webcams and even videconferencing systems.

The world's first webcam: It was created to help people working in other parts of the building avoid pointless trips to the coffee room by providing, on the user's desktop computer, a live 128×128 grayscale picture of the state of the coffee pot

One of its more famous spin-off companies was Acorn, which became a household name after developing the BBC Micro.

The
prototype of this device was developed in less than a week to meet the 
demands of the BBC’s nationwide computer literacy campaign.

Acorn laid the groundwork to develop a chip which ultimately led to the foundation of Advanced RISC Machines.

Today billions of chips are produced 
by ARM and sold to major clients around the world, featuring in the 
likes of the iPad and iPhone.

One of its more famous spin-off companies was Acorn, which became a household name after developing the BBC Micro. The prototype of this device was developed in less than a week to meet the demands of the BBC¿s nationwide computer literacy campaign. The system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes, and was also moderately successful as a home computer in the UK despite its high cost.

Prof Hopper said the centre had always been driven by a spirit of innovation.

'Today, the establishment mentality seems to be that you can industrialise innovation, or innovate on demand,' he said.

'You can’t do that any more than you can ask an artist to paint the next brilliant masterpiece.'

The tradition of innovation continued
in 2008 when the Raspberry Pi charity was set up to create an 
ultra-small, cheap computer aimed at encouraging children to learn 
computer science.

Founded
amid concerns that the number of university applicants for the subject 
across Britain was falling, it to some extent echoes the achievements of
the BBC Micro team at Acorn almost a quarter of a century earlier.

'On behalf of Google, I warmly 
congratulate the Computer Laboratory on the occasion of its 75th 
anniversary. The Computer Laboratory and Google share a strong tradition
in computer science and engineering; albeit theirs being somewhat 
longer than ours. We also applaud their culture of innovation and we 
trust that the next 75 years will be as exciting and rewarding as were 
the first 75.'

Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Google

'A key factor in Microsoft's choice 
for the location of its first research center outside of the United 
States, was the proximity to Cambridge. As one of the world’s best 
teaching and research universities, with historical links to the 
founding of computer science, Cambridge University’s Computer Laboratory
has been the hub for major advances in computing, including original 
work in building complete computers and the development of programming 
languages and operating systems. The technologies developed by the 
University, Microsoft Research and other leading technology companies in
Cambridge will be fundamental in addressing some of the greatest 
challenges of this century.'

William H. Gates III, KBE, Co-founder and Chairman of Microsoft, and Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

'The Cambridge Computer Laboratory has
been and continues to be, a world leader in the field of Computer 
Science. Its strong emphasis on academic excellence and solving 
real-world problems produces top graduates and post-graduates ready to 
work in world-leading technology companies. Qualcomm values the 
opportunity to sponsor and collaborate with excellent students and 
faculty in the Computer Lab and would like to congratulate the Lab on 
reaching this historic milestone. We look forward to many more years of 
collaboration.'

Paul Jacobs, CEO, Qualcomm
