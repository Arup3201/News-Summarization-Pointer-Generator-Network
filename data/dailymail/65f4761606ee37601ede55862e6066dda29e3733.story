Charlie Austin and Richard Dunne could be out for the rest of the season after the Queens Park Rangers duo left Loftus Road on crutches on Saturday.

Austin, the club's top goalscorer, is understood to have broken a bone in his right foot following the 1-0 defeat against Southampton that left QPR second bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against Southampton but was in discomfort as he left the ground. 

QPR striker and top goalscorer Charlie Austin could be out with injury for the rest of the season

QPR could also be without experienced defender Richard Dunne who suffered a knee injury 

Austin has been in superb form for The Hoops this season and has scored 13 goals in 19 league games

Dunne twisted his knee and had to be substituted in the 83rd minute after a block tackle on Southampton's Sadio Mane, who scored the winner for the visitors in the 93rd minute.

QPR would not discuss the extent of the damage to either player but Austin and Dunne will undergo scans ahead of Tuesday night's visit to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland.

Caretaker manager Chris Ramsey expects to remain in temporary charge, though Tim Sherwood is still favourite to take over following Harry Redknapp's departure.

Austin's absence would be nothing short of a disaster for the struggling club after the England hopeful contributed 13 goals in the Premier league this season – just one behind Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and four behind Chelsea's Diego Costa.

QPR have not won a Premier League game since beating West Brom 3-2 on December 20 last year

QPR's defeat to Southampton was their fifth in succession and are currently 19th in the Premier League table

THe Hoops have kept just four clean sheets all season, and none in their last six matches

Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is the bookmakers' favourite to replace Harry Redknapp at QPR
