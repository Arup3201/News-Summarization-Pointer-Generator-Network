Alastair Cook paid tribute to the togetherness of the England side after admitting that they had hit ‘rock bottom’ after defeat in the second Test at Lord’s.

The England captain came under considerable fire after India took a 1-0 lead in the series but the transformation since has been remarkable, with England winning well at Southampton and then thrillingly at Old Trafford yesterday by taking nine wickets in the final session of the third day.

‘We stuck together as a team,’ said Cook, who has answered doubts about his leadership in impressive style. ‘When we went 1-0 down we still thought we had a chance of winning the series because there were three games left.

Glad that's over: Cook came under fire for his leadership after England went 1-0 down in the series

‘We were pretty much at rock bottom at Lord’s but the younger guys had done well and it was just a question of the senior guys stepping up to the plate, which we’ve done now. It was a question of believing.’

Cook revealed that Stuart Broad had sent the team a congratulatory message from hospital where he was having X-rays and scans on his nose and cheekbones after being struck a fearful blow through his helmet by Varun Aaron.

‘I think he’s got a broken nose but I’ve no idea yet whether he can play at The Oval,’ said Cook. ‘We’re just waiting to see if there’s any damage to his cheekbones. It was a nasty blow.

‘We got on a roll after tea but you don’t often get nine wickets in a session,’ said Cook. ‘But when we got five wickets we knew we’d get the job done tonight.’

All smiles: Cook came out on top in the end and will be happy with England's superb performance
