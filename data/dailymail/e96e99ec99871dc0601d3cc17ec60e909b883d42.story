YouTube star Zoella, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, famously quit the internet in late 2014 after  it emerged that the editorial team at Penguin helped with the writing of her book.

The 23-year-old's debut novel, Girl Online, broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days but as rumours started to spread about a possible ghostwriter, Penguin confirmed that Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own. 

And now, her friend and fellow vlogger, Tanya Burr, is hoping for similar success as she prepares to publish her debut tome - but has already admitted she had help.

Tanya Burr,  who already has her own fashion range for Very and cosmetics line, is releasing her debut book

Tanya, whose beauty and lifestyle videos garner millions of hits, will release Love, Tanya on January 29.

Writing on her blog, the 25-year-old said: 'Books have always been a huge part of my life from a very young age. 

'I started brainstorming ideas for a book that I thought my viewers would appreciate and I came up with the idea that is now Love, Tanya.' 

Tanya explains that she wanted to write a book that told a bit of her story - including things she has never shared before - without it ending up being an autobiography. 

It will be full of beauty, fashion, baking, love, friendship, the world of YouTube and just life in general, she promises.

'I also wanted to talk about my journey to becoming confident and happy about who I am, in the hope that it might help people reading it feel more confident and happy,' she said.

But it wasn't all plain-sailing for Tanya, who admits that she had her idea rejected several times. 

'I basically got together my book idea and took it round to lots of different publishers. Most said no, I guess there wasn't a gap in the market for this kind of book at the time,' she explains.

'However, after a few months I went back and tried again and a couple of publishers said they would like to publish my book.

'However, I had my heart set on Penguin, just because they were the main publishing house I had heard of growing up and I had read so many books by them. I just felt it would be so exciting to have my very own book published my them.'

Tanya, who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the London social circuit, is already planning big things for 2015

The beauty blogger's dreams came true. Penguin got in touch and said that while her idea needed developing, they wanted to publish her musings.

Clearly learning from Zoella's mistake, Tanya added: 'Penguin hired an amazing writer, Georgina Rodgers, to help me. Although I wanted to write the whole book myself, I knew it wasn't realistic with the time scale we had to work to. 

'Georgina came over almost every day for a week and we just talked loads with a dictaphone running, I told her all about the chapters I had planned and she suggested new ones and we basically just brainstormed. 

Georgina then went home and transcribed our days of chatting and came up with a draft and structure for the book. I then spent all my time working on the text.' 

Tanya's £12.99 book isn't available for another few weeks but no doubt there are already plenty of pre-orders.

It's no secret that the adolescents of today spend much of their time online and their daily influences can be found on the web.

Dubbed The Internet Generation, there is little that young people can't consume online whether that's music, films or even books - entire lives can be stored on screen.

And for a breed of youths dubbed vloggers, filming their daily musings and sharing them on YouTube has snowballed from an innocent hobby to a money-making machine.

So successful have certain vloggers - including Tanya - become that they're taking the world of literature, beauty and television by storm.

Indeed, research this week by Fudge to celebrate their sponsorship of London Collections: Men, which kicks off on Friday, discovered that men (not just teens) are increasingly turning to YouTube lifestyle gurus for inspiration over their favourite celebrities.

Brit favourite Tanya, who lives in London, accumulates 10m views per month on her channel, has almost 2m subscribers and nearly a million Twitter followers.

So influential is Tanya that she created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes that amassed the biggest waiting list that feelunique.com had ever witnessed when they went on sale.

Speaking to MailOnline about her success, the 24-year-old said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality.

'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following.

'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely!

'I think the world of YouTube is amazing in that you can feel like you're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video. It's also incredible in that, if it wasn't for my YouTube channel, I wouldn't have started my own makeup line.

'I couldn't have done it without the support of my fans. I spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way. 

'I started with these products as I feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots.

'I love the colours I designed so much and I named them after all of my favourite things and places. 

'For example, I got engaged in New York, so I named one of the darker polishes New York Night and I love picnics so I named my favourite pretty pink gloss Picnic In The Park.'

Tanya, who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the London social circuit, says she is already planning big things for 2015, which she hopes will have have similar success.
