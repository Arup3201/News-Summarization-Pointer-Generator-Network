There were also reports of chanting students smashing patrol car windscreens,  daubing graffiti on builds and lighting flares.

A few glass store fronts were also said to have been shattered during the demonstration.

In a bid to break-up the swelling crowds security forces fired rubber bullets, smoke grenades and sound bombs, according to the website.

Up to four people were expected to face charges for assaulting police officers, according to CBC News. 

This comes after two weeks of planned strikes and protests against the proposed austerity measures.

The latest rally was declared illegal almost as soon as it started after organisers failed to lodge their route with the authorities. 

Demonstrators had gathered in the city's Emlie Gamelin Park, for the protest organised by the Revolutionary Student Movement. 

One protester and one police officer were injured during the march, according to CBC News.

Their injuries were not said to be life-threatening.  

Earlier in the day police arrested three people and detained 30 more as protesters near a city hotel.
