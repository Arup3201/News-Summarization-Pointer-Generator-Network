A former Army helicopter pilot is to become the first British astronaut to travel into space in more than 20 years.

Details of Major Tim Peake’s five-month mission to the International Space Station will be released today by the European Space Agency.

The 41-year-old is expected to be blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015.

Tim Peake has been selected to go to the International Space Station for five months

The married father of two, who was 
born in Chichester, West Sussex, will take part in spacewalks and 
complex scientific research and experiments in the Columbus laboratory 
module, which is attached to the front of the 400-ton space station.

Major Peake is the only Briton ever 
to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps. His mission will make 
him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union 
Jack, on a British Government-funded mission.

Other British astronauts have either 
secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian 
rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and 
Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle.

Major Peake’s appointment is a major boost for the British space industry, which is experiencing something of a renaissance.

Peake was one of six people to be chosen to be trained as astronauts in 2009

The UK is now the European Space 
Agency’s third largest contributor and the agency has responded by 
opening its first technical base in the country.

Nick Spall, of the British Interplanetary Society, welcomed the news of Major’s Peake’s appointment.
‘The UK can now take its rightful place and join in with important 
microgravity research work on the ISS, win industrial contracts for 
future human space flight projects and forge new links via ESA with 
Nasa, Russia and hopefully China – and, one day perhaps, India – in 
space,’ he said.

‘With exciting potential mission 
opportunities coming up for exploration across the solar system to 
asteroids, the Moon, Mars and beyond for the future, many young people 
will be inspired by Tim and his achievement. This will really help boost
the UK’s technical employment potential for jobs and industry. Human 
space flight is a win-win initiative for the UK.’

Major Peake, who has been training 
for the expedition since 2009, beat more than 8,000 hopefuls to be 
selected along with five other colleagues from across Europe.

It was thought that peake would have only a small role due to the UK's modest contributions to the Esa manned space programme

His 14-month training programme 
included visits to Nasa’s astronaut base in Houston, the Russian 
astronaut training centre in Star City outside Moscow, Tsukuba Space 
Centre in Japan, and a two-week survival course in Sardinia. He has also
had to complete mock emergency exercises to see how he copes under 
stress.

Last year it emerged that he was one 
of a team being trained to land on an asteroid to explore the surface, 
search for minerals and even learn how they might be able to destroy it 
should one pose a threat to the Earth.

Major Peake, who served in the 
British Army for 18 years, has been waiting to be assigned a space 
flight since he completed his training in November 2010.

But he recently insisted that the 
long wait did not bother him, telling an interviewer. ‘It doesn’t get 
frustrating at all. There’s just so much going on, so much diversity, 
and there’s brilliant training all along the way.’

The Sandhurst graduate received a 
commission with the Army Air Corps in 1992 and served as a platoon 
commander with the Royal Green Jackets in Northern Ireland.

He gained his wings in 1994 and became a qualified flight instructor in 1998. He retired from the Army in 2009.

Helen Sharman was the first Briton to
go into space in 1991 on Project Juno, a co-operative project between a
number of British companies and the Soviet government. She spent a week
at the Russian Mir space station.

The most experienced British-born 
astronaut is Nasa’s Michael Foale. He has accumulated 374 days in orbit,
completing long-duration missions to both the International Space 
Station and Mir.

Major Tim Peake, 41, will travel to the station in November 2015

the Sandhurst graduate is considered the first official British astronaut

This will be his first mission into space since graduating in 2010

Was feared he would only get a short mission due to the UK's modest contributions to the space programme
