Liverpool is the whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims.

Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show huge regional variations in case rates – clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts.

Whiplash claims cost insurers  £2billion a year, with bogus payouts adding £90 to the typical car insurance premium.

Whiplash: Bogus claims cost the insurance industry £2¿billion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by £90

In the 12 months to March, the number of cases in Liverpool was 22 per thousand residents. Uxbridge in West London and Oldham were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand.

Those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas.

The lowest rates were in Scotland, where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases.

A survey of GPs last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are ‘fake or over-diagnosed’. At least 30,000 – 6 per cent – are outright fraudulent, according to the Insurance Fraud Bureau.UK insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day, twice the level in other European countries.

Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘This is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made.

‘And there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims.

‘Whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down.

‘Either we have developed the weakest necks in Europe or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected.’

Aviva has called for a radical overhaul of the system, saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims.

Dominic Clayden, claims director for the insurer, said: ‘We operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to “have a go” – there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought.

'However, this “whip-cash” is not free. It is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years.

‘The UK needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve, but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums.

Crackdown: The nationwide issue was brought to light by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke who has held a 'Whiplash Summit' in Parliament in a bid to crack down on the crooks

‘The Ministry of Justice needs to increase the small claims limit to £5,000, meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers. We also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped.’

But John Spencer, of personal injury specialist Spencer’s Solicitors, said: ‘There are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that.

‘But you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated.’

Last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Car insurance costs are simply too high, they must be reduced.

‘The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims.

‘But we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the Government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down.’

Whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly, damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck – a common injury in a car accident.

However it is difficult to diagnose and doctors must rely on the patient’s description of their symptoms.
