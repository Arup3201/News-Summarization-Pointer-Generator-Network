A woman who famously pledged to 'spend, spend, spend' after winning big betting on football is holding a charity sale of memorabilia from her life.

Viv Nicholson, 77, won £152,000 in 1961 alongside her husband Keith, and promptly used it all to buy expensive clothes, cars and houses.

The win, on a football betting pool, in which gamblers predict the results of football games across a season, would be worth £2,870,000 today.

Then and now: Viv Nicholson poses, left, with her husband Keith with their winnings in 1961, and, right with her brother Geoff Asprey today ahead of the auction of memorabilia from her life

The couple frittered away half of their wealth within four years of winning.

Mr Nicholson tragically died at the wheel of his blue Jaguar in 1965, which led to Mrs Nicholson being declared bankrupt, as the tax authorities reclaimed most of her husband's wealth.

She managed to reclaim some after a lengthy legal battle, but lost it all again from poor investments on the stock market.

Mrs Nicholson married three times more, though she is now a widow again, and battled with alcohol and depression.

A shot-lived attempt to start a new life in Malta was soon curtailed after she was deported for fighting with a police officer.

In desperation she took to performing 'Big Spender' in a Manchester strip club, but was fired when she refused to take off her underwear.

In 1984, The Smiths asked her to pose for the cover of their hit single Heaven Knows I'm Miserable now.

Her story has had an enduring fascination, and was turned into a televised BBC play and later a West End musical - both called Spend, Spend, Spend.

Mrs Nicholson received royalties of around £100,000 from the musical, which were spent, and revealed in an interview with the Daily Mail in 2007 that she was living off of her state pension and seeking work.

Mrs Nicholson has suffered three strokes, and has now returned to her hometown of Castleford, Yorkshire, where she lives in a care home.

Her brother Geoff Asprey, 71, who wrote a single entitled Spend, Spend, Spend based on her experiences, is now planning to auction off items from his sister's colourful life, which he has kept.

The money will be used to buy iPads for the elderly so that they can stay in touch more easily.

The pair have set up the Asprey Nicholson Foundation and plan to use some of the proceeds to form an 'e-village' and stay connected.

Fame: Mrs Nicholson's life was immortalised in the musical Spend, Spend, Spend. It debuted on the West End in 1999, where Barbara Dickson, left, played Mrs Nicholson

Mr Asprey said: 'The object of the foundation is to buy iPads they can use in a sort of e-village and talk to each other the internet. We’re hoping to raise as much as we can.

'Viv’s a figure who stands there to show what can happen when you have got nobody when you are old.'

The siblings are exhibiting the memorabilia at an empty unit at Carlton Lanes Shopping Centre in Castleford, and plan to hold the auction in the new year.

Items on sale include photos of the two in their various club bands, along with microphone stands and other stage equipment, items from her home before the big win and even a drawing by Mrs Nicholson.

Mr Asprey added: 'I wanted Castleford people to see what she has been left with.

'Viv doesn’t have anything herself, all these items are ones I’ve saved or collected over the years.'
