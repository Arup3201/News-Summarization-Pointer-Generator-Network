The Pacific airline which became the first in the world to charge people according to their weight is to introduce an 'XL class' this week for its heavyweight passengers.

Samoa Air is modifying some of the seating in its fleet of propeller aircraft to cater for people who weigh more than 20 stone.

Like many Pacific islands, Samoa has heavier people as a result of genetics or the large amounts of root vegetables they consume.

More room up top: The airline will fit special seats in a row dedicated to the larger passenger

The country regularly appears among obesity statistics, with more than 80 per cent of the population over the age of 15 regarded as overweight.

Now all the airline's Britten Norman and Cessna aircraft are being fitted out with a special XL row that has been extended by up to 14 inches to provide more leg - and stomach - room, with more space between the seats.

Samoa Air chief executive Chris Langton told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the airline had also added a special ramp on its planes to allow for easier access for large passengers.

'Once you're up and around that sort of weight, a traditional seat on any airline is going to be uncomfortable,' said Mr Langton.

Anything to declare? The people of Samoa are typically larger due to their diet of root vegetables

'Quite often the access is difficult and even the space between the seats is enough that even when you've squeezed into the seats there's no room for your legs.

'We don't have a large fleet of aeroplanes, but we wanted to do something that recognised that we are thinking about this.'

Mr Langton said the XL size was available with clothing and it was no different when catering for larger aircraft passengers.

'The airline industry is going to have to do that - we're going to have to provide a range of seats categorised in terms of weight and maybe some other indexes like height.

'So when people travel they can give us those indicators and we can allocate them to an appropriate seat.'

Samoa Air introduced a 'pay by weight' booking system earlier this year, requiring passengers to type in their weight on the airline's online reservation system, where their individual fares were calculated.

On the airline's shortest domestic route, rates range from 60p for 2.2lb to £2.50 per pound for travel from Samoa to neighbouring American Samoa.

Mr Langton said the rate includes a passenger's body weight and baggage.

A passenger weighing 10 stone, for example, will be able to purchase a domestic ticket for about £40.

The airline began flying within Samoa last year and it has now expanded to connect with neighbouring islands.
