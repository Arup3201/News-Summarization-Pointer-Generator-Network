Melbourne motorists have been urged to stay away from the Monash Freeway this afternoon after it was closed earlier following a major chemical spill.

The Country Fire Authority (CFA) reports that a specialist hazardous materials team has controlled the spill from a drum of highly flammable aviation fuel, which occurred just before 11am.

200 litres of the fuel was being transported in a truck also carrying other highly dangerous chemicals - however authorities say the heavy mover did not crash or roll over.

'Firefighters in fully enclosed gas suits worked successfully for several hours to prevent the chemicals mixing or igniting,' said the CFA.

All inbound and outbound lanes were expected to be open by the peak hour period.

Earlier, CFA crews had issued urgent advice, which requested that residents turn off all air-conditioning units.

Fire authorities urged residents in the area to stay inside and switch off air conditioners while the clean up of the aviation fuel took place

Operations Officer Greg Christison that a passer-by had alerted the truck driver to the chemical leak who then pulled over and contacted emergency services about the problem.

Firefighters were immediately sent to the scene at the Heatherton Road overpass.

The truck leaked about 200 litres of highly flammable aviation fuel, the CFA said.

VicRoads has confirmed that even with the re-opening of the freeway, that motorists making their way home should expect delays throughout the afternoon and evening.
