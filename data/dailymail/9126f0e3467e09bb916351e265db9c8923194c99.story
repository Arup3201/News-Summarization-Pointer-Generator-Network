A talented high school musician has died suddenly in Maine, just three days after having surgery to remove impacted wisdom teeth.

Benjamin Edward LaMontagne died in his mother's arms in the early hours of Saturday after his condition started to deteriorate after the routine procedure.

A cause of death for the 18-year-old has not been determined yet, but his parents, Peter and Lynn, believe it was caused by surgery complications.

Tragic: Talented high school musician Benjamin Edward LaMontagne died in his mother's arms in the early hours of Saturday after his condition started to deteriorate following a routine dental procedure

If his death is found to have been caused by surgery complications, it would be a rare occurrence, according to dentists.

While still grief-stricken, Benjamin's parents have repeatedly praised the efforts of first responders.

'The
 emergency response, we feel, appeared like magic,' Peter LaMontagne. 
'We recognized the challenges with providing emergency response on a 
rural Maine island.'

Benjamin's mother Lynn first called for assistance around 1am Saturday when Benjamin had stopped breathing.

The teen had reportedly suffered some typical swelling and pain following the procedure and by Friday it had intensified.

And by the early morning hours, he was dead.

Dr
 Thomas Dodson said that in 20 years of surveys at the Massachusetts 
hospital he used to work at, not a single death was recorded in patients
 who had wisdom teeth extracted.

The dentist, who is chair of the Department of Oral
 
and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, 
had not reviewed Benjamin's case but has decades of experience.

'I’m

 trained as an epidemiologist, and I can’t say I’ve even ever read 
[about a death] anywhere,' he told the Portland Press Herald.

'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way,' said LaMontagne¿s closest friend Christian Cilley, left. 'You could either jump on the train or watch it fly by'

The
 Long Island, Maine community where Benjamin's family live has been left 
reeling by the unexpected death of the honors student who had been 
accepted at Pennsylvania's Sunderman 
Conservatory of Music.

The teenager, who played bass clarinet and enjoyed jazz, was a dedicated student who also enjoyed sailing and lobster fishing.

'If anybody could say they had a 
complete life after 18 short years, it was Benjamin, which makes it all 
the more painful to have him taken from us so soon,' Benjamin's father Peter LaMontagne told the Portland Press Herald.

His school friend Christian Cilley, who would often busk with Benjamin in town, said: 'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way.'

The
 18-year-old fished for lobsters from his skiff and over the summer had 
worked on a lobster boat. But music was his main passion, and he was one
 of only two students to have received the merit scholarship for Sunderman Conservatory.

Music teacher Julia
 Frothingham, who taught Benjamin bass clarinet for six years at Cheverus
 High School, said: 'I know he’s not my son, but I feel like I watched 
him grow up. I’ll miss not being able to see where he goes from here.'
