More than 110,000 people are living with funeral debt in Britain - according to Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck

Families are burying dead relatives in their gardens because of the rising cost of funerals, a Labour MP has claimed.

Emma Lewell-Buck said some people are being forced to sell possessions or take out pay-day loans to fund a proper send-off.

Others are holding DIY funerals or choosing cut-price cremations with no formal service, she claimed.

According to research, the average cost of a funeral has reached more than £3,500 – nearly twice the level a decade ago.

In some areas, the figure can approach £7,000 because of a lack of burial space.

The MP for South Shields said one fifth of the 500,000 families bereaved each year struggle to afford the cost of a funeral, with more than 100,000 in the country now owing funeral debts.

She said the problem will get worse as the price of a service accelerates faster than inflation, with the average cost standing at £3,551. 

In some areas of the country the price may approach £7,000 due to issues over burial space availability, MPs heard.

She told the Commons: ‘Everyone who loses someone close to them wants to give them a decent send-off, but sadly fewer and fewer people are now able to afford even a basic funeral.

‘As well as rising debts, we’re also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral.

'Some are holding do-it-yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden.

‘A number of companies are offering cut-price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service.’ 

The Labour MP pressed ministers to tackle ‘funeral poverty’ by holding a UK-wide review of funeral service costs and to reform a Government social fund designed to help low-income households.

Funeral directors should also be required to let people know the price of a ‘simple service’ to make it easier for people to choose an affordable service, the South Shields MP said. 

Home burials are legal in Britain if the householder owns the freehold, but estate agents estimate having a body buried on a property can reduce its value by £50,000.

Mrs Lewell-Buck, who is calling for a review of funeral poverty, said research by insurer Royal London estimates that 110,000 are living with funeral debt, with each person owing over £1,300 on average.

The average cost for a cremation funeral is £3,163, including £654 for the cremation and £2,224 for the funeral director. A burial funeral costs on average £3,933, including £1,584 for the burial. 

Ms Lewell-Buck told the Commons: ‘One woman from my area approached the Citizens Advice Bureau with unmanageable debts.

Funerals are rising in cost leaving many poor families unable to afford them. This has caused some people to bury their relatives in their back yard

‘She had been unable to get the money together to pay for a headstone for her brother's grave.

‘She ended up applying for a payday loan and the cost of repaying this debt had quickly got out of control. Sadly her story is not an isolated one.

‘Royal London estimates that 110,000 people are living with funeral debt, with each person owing over £1,300 on average.

‘As well as rising debts, we're also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral.

‘Some are holding do it yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden.

‘A number of companies are offering cut-price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service attached to them.

‘Increasingly bereaved individuals who simply cannot afford a formal service are faced with having to opt for a public health funeral - or what used to be referred to as pauper's funerals.'

Ms Lewell-Buck said a review of funeral poverty costs would need to consider the amount of burial space available, how deaths are registered, the impact of competition between private and local authority crematoria, and the support offered via the benefits system to people who cannot afford a service.

Addressing state support from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for low-income households, the MP said the social fund is ‘well overdue for reform’.

She said: ‘The system doesn't function well at the minute and even encourages some households into debt.

‘Applications are lengthy and confusing and especially for somebody who is just bereaved. They can also take around 17 days to have an outcome.

‘DWP also requires an invoice to claim, which means that people who want to arrange a funeral quickly have to agree their costs before they even know if they qualify for help or not.

‘This is worrying when we know 50% of claims are rejected - about 30,000 a year.’

Ms Lewell-Buck asked for the need for an invoice to be removed, saying that this would allow people to check their eligibility before committing to funeral costs.

She also suggested the DWP streamlines the process to result in quicker decisions.

Ms Lewell-Buck was given permission to bring in the Funeral Services Bill.

She asked for it to be given a second reading on January 23. It is unlikely to become law in its current form without Government support or sufficient parliamentary time.
