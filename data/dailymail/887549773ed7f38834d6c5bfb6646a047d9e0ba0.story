Hollywood star Charlie Sheen has denounced Danish authorities over the arrests of 14 Sea Shepherd activists, including an Australian, in the Faroe Islands.

The actor donated one of three inflatable boats used by the conservationalist group to try to save a pod of pilot whales being lured toward hunters on the island of Sandoy.

Krystal Keynes, from Exmouth in Western Australia, was among 14 activists who were arrested and detained by Danish officials. The boats were seized by the Danish navy.

Sheen accused the Danish authorities of assisting in the 'brutal slaughter'.

'I am proud that a vessel bearing my name was there and did all it could to try to stop this atrocity,' the Anger Management star said.

'The 40-foot Zodiac called the BS SHEEN that I donated to Mr (Sea Shepherd leader Paul) Watson's tireless and heroic efforts, has been shamefully seized. This level of insidious and vicious corruption must be dealt with swiftly and harshly.'

The method involves the mammals being forced into a bay by flotillas of small boats before being hacked to death with hooks and knives.

Many locals defend the hunt as a cultural right, but animal rights campaigners have denounced it as a "brutal and archaic mass slaughter".

Ms Keynes was released on Sunday and is expected to face court on September 25, along with seven others from the boats.
