The shamed marine who urinated on dead Taliban fighters was broken by the infamy that followed, his wife said after he was given a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.

Rob Richards, 28, was given an armed salute and eulogy at the nation's most hallowed burial ground,  despite the 38-second video which ended his career.

Richards, who served three tours in Afghanistan, was condemned by figures as senior as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when the footage emerged in 2012.

Shamed: Rob Richards, pictured left and right with his wife Raechel, was given a military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery

Outrage: The video, which emerged in 2012, showed Richards and three other marines urinating on the bodies of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan

And, according to his wife Raechel, the aftermath sent him into a depression which ended in his death from an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers which built up in his body.

Speaking to the Washington Post, she said: 'He felt backed into a corner. He always said, "It’s all I’ll ever be known for."'

She described how his discharge after a court martial quashed his dreams of becoming a defense contractor, and sparked a drug addiction which led to the couple separating.

They reunited after Richards finished drugs counseling - but just months later he was found dead at home. Doctors believe painkillers he was given had built up in his system leading to an overdose.

Burial: Richards's cremated remains, held in the above box by Raechel, were laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, in a military ceremony

Hallowed ground: Richards was buried in Arlington, for which he was eligible as he was not dishonorably discharged after his court martial

Respect: These seven U.S. marines fired a volley in remembrance of Richards at the Arlington ceremony

Honored: Raechel Richards is handed an American flag by comrades of Richards at the funeral

The funeral took place in mid-February at the Virginia burial ground, and was attended by some 300 mourners, as well as family members. He was given an armed salute by seven riflemen, and a musical tribute by an army bugler.

A chaplain at the ceremony said Richards: 'served with honor... gave so much...  and bled for our freedom'.

He described Arlington as a 'fitting' place for his cremated remains, held in a metal box marked with military designs, to rest.

According to military rules, any veteran is eligible for their cremated remains to be buried at Arlington - so long as they were not dishonorably discharged.

Thanks to a plea deal made at his court martial, Richards was allowed an honorable discharge, so long as he took a demotion and left the army straight away - leaving the door open for an Arlington ceremony. 

After the ceremony, members of his platoon attempted to justify the actions of Richards and three other marines who appeared in the footage.

Justification: At an event after the ceremony, comrades of Richards attempted to justify the actions

One, Sergeant Edward Deptola, described how the sniper team had hunted down the Taliban members.

The fighters were suspected of laying roadside bombs which blew a leg off one of their comrades - which militants later hung from a tree as a grim warnings.

They opened fire from 50 yards away, Deptola said, and were angry and jubilant at the kill when one suggested they urinate on them

Deptola said they did it 'because killing them wasn't enough. That wasn't enough justice.'

Richards had earlier defended himself, saying in 2013: 'When you're under that much stress and in that environment, your whole mental being changes.

'You're no longer Joe the family man. You're a warrior, and if you read back to Biblical wars and wars since the dawn of time, men have been doing this to men for millennia.'
