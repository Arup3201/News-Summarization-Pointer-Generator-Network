The unbelievable behaviour of an irresponsible father's idea of a fun game to entertain his young kids of precariously dangling them over the train tracks has been captured on security surveillance.

The dad was waiting for a train with his young family at Wentworthville station, in western Sydney, when he first decided to carry his baby right to the edge of the platform and look over the tracks.

But what happens next is almost too much to comprehend.

The man then picks up his daughter, who looks as young as four years old, and dangles her by the arms over the platform edge and then lowers her down onto the tracks.

As if this reckless act was shocking enough the man then lets go of his little girl's hands.

It was then that the careless dad seems to hear a noise and then pulls his daughter back up onto the platform.

No more than five seconds later a train flies through the station at a frightening speed proving that the silly stunt almost become a tragic disaster.

Sydney Trains director Tony Eid said the train was travelling at 100km/h when the driver spotted the young girl only 200 metres away on the tracks

He described the incident as 'reckless' and 'stupid' as the driver was forced to use the emergency break which takes 600 metres for the train to stop. 

'The driver turned his head away. He didn't think she was going to get off the tracks,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'He was so shaken by the incident he had to have time off work.'

Police have been informed of the incident.
