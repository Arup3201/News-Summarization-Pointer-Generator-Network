Not again? Not again, says LeBron James.

The 30-year-old NBA star has shot down rumors of leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat, calling the speculation 'outlandish'.

Eyebrows were raised on Christmas Day when LeBron was caught on camera talking to former Heat teammate Dwayne Wade after the Cavaliers lost to Miami.

It was LeBron's first game since against the Heat since leaving his former team, and he said to his friend that 'if things aren't better this year, we're gonna reunite again and do some bigger and better things, all right?'.

But on Wednesday he was forced to acknowledge the video after it started swirling around the internet. 

'I've seen that video too,' James told The New York Post.

'I don't know exactly what I said, but I know it had nothing to do about basketball. 

'I wouldn't say that on Christmas, in front of cameras. 

'That (conversation) had nothing to do with me leaving here.

'I didn't go to college, but I'm not stupid. 

If I would have said something, I would have said it the (previous) night to D-Wade. 

'I'm here now and I'm here to build something in the future.'

However, Cleveland.com are reporting that James  'won't hesitate to make the appropriate business decision if it means bolting'.

James spurned his home-region Cavaliers for the Heat in 2010.

But after winning his long-sought after first NBA titles with Miami, he returned to Cleveland vowing to bring the city a major sports title, something not seen there since the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1964.

 

'The schedule came out after I had decided to come back,' he said

'The NBA knew something.

'They knew that I was going to go home or stay in Miami, so they knew I would have to play my home team or my old teammates.'

James, who ranks second in NBA scoring with 25.2 points a game and fifth in assists with 7.8 a contest, has sparked the Cavaliers to a 16-10 record, fifth in the Eastern Conference.

The Heat, who brought in Luol Deng to try and ease the sting of losing James, are 13-15, seventh in the East. Miami fans could greet James with boos when he takes to the court, or cheers to acknowledge his success with the Heat.

Either way, James is looking ahead not back.

'I live in the present,' James said. 

'Yesterday is over with. The future is unknown.'

Miami's remaining 'Big Three' members are holding their own, with guard Dwyane Wade scoring 22.8 points a game and forward Chris Bosh averaging 21.6.

James' new 'Big Three' partners in Cleveland are faring well also, with Australian guard Kyrie Irving netting 19.7 points a game and big man Kevin Love averaging 16.8 points and 10.5 rebounds a night.
