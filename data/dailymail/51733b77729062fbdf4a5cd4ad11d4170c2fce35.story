Hereford United's suspension 'from all football activity' has been lifted by The FA just 24 hours after it was imposed.

English football's governing body handed out the punishment on Wednesday after Hereford and club official Alan McCarthy failed to comply with regulations under the owners' and directors' test.

McCarthy had been charged with acting as an officer of Hereford without written confirmation from the FA to do so. Yet the issue appears to have been a largely clerical one, with the governing body requesting additional documentation which has since been provided.

An FA statement read: 'The suspension of and Alan McCarthy from all football and football activity has been lifted with immediate effect following their compliance with the orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission.' 

The club, famous for producing one of the FA Cup's best-loved giantkillings, were expelled from the Football Conference in June after missing a deadline to pay football creditors, and have been playing in the Southern Premier League. 

'Having failed to comply with the orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission, both Hereford United and Alan McCarthy are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect,' Wednesday's FA statement read.

'The club and Mr McCarthy, Officer of Hereford United FC, were ordered to fully and correctly comply with their obligations under the Owners' and Directors' Test Regulations by 4pm on Thursday 4 December 2014.

'Following consideration of a document submitted by the club, the Independent Regulatory Commission gave the parties until 4pm on Monday 8 December 2014 to submit further documentation to satisfy the orders of the Commission.

'Having failed to provide the requested further documentation by the deadline, both Hereford United and Mr McCarthy shall remain suspended until such time as the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission has been complied with to the satisfaction of the Commission.

'The FA understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to Hereford at the earliest opportunity, although this will be contingent on the club complying with the Regulations and subsequent orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission.'

Cash-strapped Hereford were expelled from the Football Conference in June for failing to pay creditors

The club have been based at their Edgar Street home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future

Despite mostly languishing among the lower reaches of the Football League, Hereford will be remembered for one of the FA Cup's most famous giantkillings.

Few gave the then non-League team a prayer in their FA Cup third round replay against Newcastle United in February 1972.

Things looked even bleaker when Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle ahead with just eight minutes left of the match, which was played on a quagmire of a pitch. But Ronnie Radford scored with a bullet shot from 30 yards with five minutes remaining to spark a pitch invasion, then a 2-1 extra-time win and also a generation's love affair with football.

Legendary BBC commentator John Motson, during his first full season working for Match Of The Day, helped the game into football folklore as he said: 'No goalkeeper in the world would have stopped that.'
