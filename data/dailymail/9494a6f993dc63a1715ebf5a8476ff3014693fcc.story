The terror in the voice of a New Jersey man who escaped a fatal bear attack is palpable is a newly released 911 call record just moments after the animal had fatally wounded his friend.

Rutgers University senior Darsh Patel was hiking through the Apshawa Preserve with friends this Sunday when they were attacked.

At least one male member of the hiking party - not identified by authorities - was able to get away and call for help.

Attacks: Northern New Jersey locals captured this black bear looking for food in their garbage in September. Just a day after the footage was shot,  a black bear mauled a 22-year-old student to death in the woods nearby

Patel, 22, was later found mauled to death.

In the 911 call, the friend can be heard to explain the situation, ABC News reports.

'We were hiking and we saw a bear and we all started running and it started chasing us,' he says.

He adds that two other friends were also 'really close' to the animal.

'I'm scared out of my mind for them,' he says. 'I want to go back but I'm hurt and I don't know what to do.'

The dispatcher asks: 'You're hurt, you said?'

'Not badly,' he replies. 'I just scraped my leg. It's nothing major, but I'm more worried about them. Can anybody get here anytime really soon please?'

Locals in northern New Jersey believe they filmed a black bear hunting for food hours before a 22-year-old hiker was mauled to death in nearby woods at the weekend.

Two men splitting wood on Saturday captured a video of a bear going through garbage just a few feet from where they were working, before scampering off into the woods, according to CNN.

On Sunday, Patel,  who was majoring in information technology and informatics, was found dead in Apshawa Preserve - about 45 miles northwest of New York City - with a 300-pound bear guarding his body.

Officials say the attack was the first fatal bear-human encounter on record in New Jersey.

The bear was about 30 yards from the body and circling, Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said, and wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones.

The male bear was killed with two rifle blasts and is being examined at a state lab for more clues as to why it may have pursued the group of five hikers.

Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food.

State and local officials stressed that bear attacks are rare even in a region of the state that may have as many as 2,400 bruins in its dense forests. 

'This is a rare occurrence,' West Milford police Chief Timothy Storbeck said, noting that his department receives six to 12 calls per week regarding bears, usually involving them breaking into trash cans.

Locals: Residents in northern New Jersey often spot bears in and around their yards. There are as many 2,400 bruins in the area's dense forests, but until now had never been a fatal human-bear attack

Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. 

Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run.

The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said.

New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.'

NJ Advance Media reports that the New Jersey State Medical Examiner, the Fish and Wildlife Division of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the West Milford Police Department are looking into the circumstances of Patel's death.

'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. 

'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they’re obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.'

Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted.

In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.
