Arrested: 33-year-old Adam Robin Green broke into a downtown Salt Lake City theater

Authorities are investigating after a man was arrested, accused of allegedly trying to kidnap a girl at knife-point at a theater over the weekend.

Police in Utah haven now arrested 33-year-old Adam Robin Green who they say broke into a downtown Salt Lake City theater and tried to abduct 12-year-old actress.

Salt Lake City police say  Green entered the Off Broadway Theatre through a backdoor on Saturday night and entered a hallway restricted to cast and crew.

He had a knife and waited for a 12-year-old girl to walk down the hallway before jumping out behind her. 

When the girl turned, she told authorities she saw Green with a knife in his right hand and she ran the other way. 

Salt Lake City Police Detective Greg Wilking says the girl ran and Green fled the theater. 

A short time later, police were called to a fast food restaurant where a man was acting 'bizarre.' 

Arriving officers said Green was talking to himself and 'behaving strangely.'

When the officers realized he matched the description from the Off Broadway Theatre incident, he was taken into custody. 

Scene: Green was spotted with a knife in his hand and he went to attack the 12-year-old actress at the Off Broadway Theatre

Wilking says there are no indications Green targeted the girl before seeing her in the hallway.

Green is being held in Salt Lake County jail on suspicion of burglary, kidnapping and assault.

The man was already facing a charge or aggravated assault for a separate November 1st incident, according to court records. 

In that case, Green allegedly threatened to 'smash' his roommate's head for moving his chairs. 

He then hit his roommate on the head with a broom, attempted to hit him with a rock, strangled his roommate and extinguished a cigarette on his forehead, charging documents state.
