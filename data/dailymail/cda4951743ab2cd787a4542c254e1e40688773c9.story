When you're in the grip of new love a little public display of affection might seem harmless.

You could even be the most discreet of loved-up couples but when you're head over heels for one another you might find yourself unable to resist holding hands or even kissing in public.

But while a subtle smooch or romantic gesture might seem like a scene from a Hollywood film in your head, onlookers may see it quite differently.

How you think you look: PDA may seem like a harmless show of love for one another, even when demonstrated in front of complete strangers

What you really look like: But it can make most people feel quite uncomfortable, especially if they are more conservative by nature

A writer from the Bold Italic was faced with one of the most awkward PDAs we've ever heard of in a local Whole Foods, which made her feel supremely uncomfortable.

'When I walked in, a couple in the middle of the prepared-foods section was already embracing and mashing tongues together with such fervour, and for so incredibly long, that they essentially added an extra T to the Hot Bar,' writes Jessica Saia, from Chicago, in a new article for the website.

'At first, I thought, "Sure, I get it. The mac and cheese, the sweating condensation on the sneeze guards: no one's arguing it isn't sexy". But later that same trip, another couple was making out with abandon directly in front of the cured meats, and I really needed to get in there. God, it was like his mouth was the mortar and her tongue was the pestle. 

'I tried to avoid entering the splash zone of saliva while blindly grabbing at a package of prosciutto, barely being able to ascertain which option was the cheapest. But they were completely unaware of my presence. With their eyes closed and clinging to each other's faces, they clearly pictured the scene as a romantic one - close cropped and soft focused, with bits of blue cheese crumbling around them like snowflakes and some Seal song playing in their heads drowning out the wet slap of their gums.

'It wasn't like that - not to me.'

And so with the Bold Italic's stable of photographers at her disposal, she enlisted snapper Tom Kubik to capture a series of posed-up PDAs we recognise all too well, in an attempt to capture how you may think your PDA looks compared to how the rest of the world sees it. 

The resulting images represented couples lost in the moment with only eyes for each other - feeding each other popcorn, kissing a lady's hand like an English gentleman and sharing a Lady and the Tramp spaghetti moment in an Italian restaurant.

But the 'reality' half of the images showed a caricature of those moments, exaggerated to magnify how awkward they can be for everyone else when put into the context of a public setting.

While they may be a little extreme and created in light humour to prove a point, PDA can certainly make people feel quite anxious and even queasy, especially those who are more conservative, reserved - or perhaps single.

A hand innocently placed on the lower back can easily slide down to bottom level, and a peck on the lips can progress into a French kiss when you're feeling passionate.

So to avoid making others feel uncomfortable, it may be a good idea to hold off until you get home.
