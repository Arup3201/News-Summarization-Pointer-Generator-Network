A man appeared in court today charged with attempting to blackmail a celebrity with information which will 'destroy them' if it becomes public.

Desmond Fraser, 31, threatened to reveal 'extremely embarrassing' information about the star, a court heard.

At Winchester Crown Court, Judge Susan Evans QC ordered the person's identity and the nature of the demand must not be published.

The celebrity, who can only be referred to as 'T', told the court they were filled with 'fear' and 'panic' when they learned of Fraser's alleged intentions.

T added: 'At first I thought it could be a wind-up but it caused me some alarm.

'I get people threatening me and saying silly things all the time but there was detail there (on this occasion) and I thought there could be something in it.

'It caught my attention.

'I went to the police because I was petrified. I did not know what to do but was advised by my legal representatives to do that.'

Prosecutor Mary Aspinall-Miles said 'T' believes the information would 'destroy them'.

She told the court: 'It is material of which a blackmailer could only dream.'

Winchester Crown Court heard the information is 'material of which a blackmailer could only dream'

The judge granted an order which said:
 'Nothing is to be published identifying the victim of the charge or the
 details of the demand of money with menaces.

'No person or persons are to publish those details by any means whatsoever, including publishing between individuals.'

Courts are allowed to grant anonymity to blackmail victims to prevent them from further embarrassment or distress.

The judge granted a separate anonymity order to a number of the victim's associates.

Fraser, from Wallasey, Merseyside, who works in the security industry, denies one charge of blackmail.

The case opened in front of a jury yesterday and is expected to finish on Tuesday.
