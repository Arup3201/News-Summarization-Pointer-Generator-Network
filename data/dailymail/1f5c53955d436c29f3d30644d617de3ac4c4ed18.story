Louis van Gaal has found one of the key missing ingredients for his Manchester United side in midfielder Daley Blind, according to former Red Devils defender Paul McGrath.

The Irishman, who made 163 league appearances for United between 1982 and 1989, believes £14million summer-signing Blind is exactly what United 'have been looking for' in the middle of the park.

Blind starred under Van Gaal for Holland during the World Cup in Brazil and McGrath told Talksport how he was impressed with the midfielder's Old Trafford debut as well.

The Dutchman controlled the pace of the match against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday during United's 4-0 win and his passing was exemplary.

McGrath told the Alan Brazil breakfast show: 'Blind is a class act.was watching him in particular against Queens Park Rangers.

'The defensive stuff he does is what United have been looking for.

'He was running around making defensive tackles, as well as connecting it to the front.'
