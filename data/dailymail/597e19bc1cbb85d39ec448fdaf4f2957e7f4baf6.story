Samir Nasri has flown back to the UK to join up with Manchester City for pre-season training, after spending a stress-free summer with girlfriend Anara Atanes.

The 27-year-old playmaker was left out of Didier Deschamps' France squad and it should be City that reap the rewards with Nasri at his freshest ahead of what is likely to be another tough campaign battling on four fronts at home and in Europe.

And Nasri looked pleased to be back when he flew into Heathrow on Tuesday.

The midfielder's girlfriend posted a number of pictures of the pair while they were on holiday, with Nasri looking nice and relaxed in all of them.

And Pellegrini will surely be excited at the prospect of having one of last season's City stars back in tip-top condition after a strenuous summer for most of his squad out in Brazil.

Nasri is expected to return to training on Monday alongside City's other holidaying stars including Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo.
