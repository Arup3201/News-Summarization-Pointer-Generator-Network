It started with a twinge for one and ended with a whinge for the other, but two British players scored impressive victories on the opening day of the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club.

For James Ward, there was a fine straight-sets win over Blaz Rola, followed by a rather testy complaint in his press conference about questions on the subject of female coaches.

Then there was Dan Evans, Britain’s No 2, who later in the afternoon pulled off a significant upset in the first round by knocking out Jurgen Melzer, a top-10 player three years ago.

More impressively, Evans' win came against the backdrop of pain in his left knee that has lingered for nine months and will require a lay-off from the game after Wimbledon.

On form: Evans defeated the world No 51 in three sets to reach the second round

Often
 maligned and sanctioned in the past for his attitude, the 24-year-old 
delivered an exhibition of his undoubted talents with a 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 
win over Austria’s world No 51.

The
 world No 139 won the first set 6-3 and led in the second-set tiebreak 
before two double faults — accompanied by a racket toss — let the 
Austrian back in. Melzer, 33, pressed home his advantage, breaking early
 in the third set.

But 
Evans first levelled and then excelled as the match went into another 
tiebreak. He forced an early mini-break with a delightful backhand pass 
down the line and led 5-2 when Melzer shanked a forehand into the 
stands.

Evans wrapped up 
the win with an ace down the middle to set up a second-round 
clash against South African Kevin Anderson, the seventh seed, this 
morning.

‘It was a good 
win,’ said Evans. ‘I played well, I took my chances when I needed them 
and fought back from a break down in the third. It was a good day.’

Having
 previously received punishments — including the cutting of his funding 
in 2008 — from the LTA over his behaviour, Evans has apparently turned a
 corner with a string of impressive results, such as a run to the last 
32 at the 2013 US Open.

He added: ‘Obviously Wimbledon is where you want to win the matches because there are more points there.

‘Second, third, fourth round of Wimbledon would be pretty good. Winning some matches in Wimbledon will be a goal.’

Sharp: Ward was in impressive form as he overcame a 64-place ranking deficit to beat Rola

Ward,
 meanwhile, had little trouble in staging a decent upset against 
Slovenia’s Rola, overcoming a 64-place ranking deficit to beat the world
 No 91 7-5, 6-4.

Ward went on a stunning run to the semi-finals here in 2011.

‘That
 run was obviously like a one‑off,’ said the world No 155. ‘I played 
unbelievable the whole week. You can’t do that every week. But I think 
I’m playing a lot better, a lot more consistent. With the opportunities 
in the next few weeks, hopefully I’ll keep moving forward.’

Daniel Cox broke early against France’s Adrian Mannarino, but failed to make it a British hat-trick as he lost 7-5, 6-2.
