An Oklahoma police captain has been sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for shooting dead an unarmed teenager who was running away from him.

Del City captain Randy Trent Harrison was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for shooting Dane Scott Jr in the back.

The 18-year-old had been involved in a chase with Harrison, after the police captain tried to pull over his car in March 2012.

Victim: Dane Scott Jr was shot in the back after a scuffle with Harrison in 2012

During a scuffle Scott pointed a handgun at Harrison's head before the police captain disarmed him.

The 48-year-old had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and prosecutors said his pursuit of the teenager had crossed the line from professional to personal.

The defense portrayed Scott as a drug dealer, and said Harrison believed the teenager had been reaching for a second weapon at the time he was shot.

Oklahoma County District Judge Donald Deason sentenced Harrison after the victim's parents, Dane Scott Sr, and Deloise Dockins read emotional statements describing the impact their son's death had on them.Â 

Harrison, dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit and shackled, stood nearby.

Defense attorney Carolyn Merritt pleaded for Judge Deason to sentence Harrison, a 23-year veteran officer, to probation.

A pre-sentencing investigation report by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had recommended that Harrison receive probation.

But District Attorney David Prater urged the judge to impose a prison sentence and said Harrison had made inconsistent statements about his actions on the day Scott died.
