the hottest day of the year so far. 

But the glorious weather will give way to downpours this weekend, forecasters have predicted.

It
 will come as bad news for sports fans planning to attend the Wimbledon 
finals, Silverstone and the opening stages of the Tour de France in 
Yorkshire.

Meanwhile, thousands of music 
enthusiasts will be hoping the rain holds off as they flock to London for Hyde

Dan Williams, of the Met Office, told the Daily Mirror the
 South and East of England would see a warm, sunny day today, while rain
 in the North and West will restrict temperatures to a maximum of 23C 
(73F).

'A band of rain will head in to western parts of England and Wales, and 
the North during the day. But southern sunny spells could make it the 
hottest day this year,' he said this morning.

But MeteoGroup
 forecaster, Matt Dobson, said today's warm weather will give way to a 
cooler weekend, giving cyclists taking part in the first stages of the Tour
 de France the chance to get a real 
taste of the British summer.

Competitors and spectators 
will see sunshine with the possibility of an occasional shower tomorrow,
 with heavy rain and even lightning more likely to strike during the 
Tour's second day in Britain on Sunday, he said.

Taking the leap: Record temperatures attracted day-trippers, sunbathers and swimmers to Brighton seafront this afternoon. Above, a man jumps off a cliff into the sea

'We've
 got a band of fairly heavy showers moving eastward across Yorkshire. 
There's a potential for some of these to be quite heavy and there could 
even be some lightning,' he said.

Mr Dobson added that the heavy rain forecast for tonight should have cleared by the time the race starts late tomorrow morning.

'The
 rain should clear by about 9am so it should be dry for the start,' he 
said. 'For much of Saturday it looks like being relatively dry but it 
won't be quite as warm as it has been recently. I think there will be a 
reasonable amount of sunshine but there is a small chance of a shower in
 the afternoon.'

But he said he could not be so optimistic about Sunday, which is 'going to be a lot more unsettled'.

Despite this weekend's gloomy forecast, temperatures are expected to soar again next week.

 Weather's James Madden told the Daily Express: 'By the middle part of 
next week there is potential for it to become very hot, in particular in
 some parts to the south and west.'

Yesterday, a previous high of 27.7CC was recorded in the village of Writtle, near 
Chelmsford, Essex - beating the likes of Portugal, Turkey and Spain.

The Met Office said a new high of 28C was reached in the same area this afternoon.

Yorkshire's cycling fans will be pleased to hear that the worst weather
 of the Tour de France's three-day visit to Britain appears to be predicted 
for when the 198 riders arrive on The Mall, in London, on Monday.

The first stage of the Tour de France begins in the centre of Leeds tomorrow morning.

The
 teams will coast to nearby Harewood House where the race proper - 
through the Yorkshire Dales to Harrogate - will be started by the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The second stage, on Sunday, 
goes from York, through the moors and hills of the South Pennines to 
Sheffield.

The
 Grand Depart got off to a spectacular start last night when all the 
riders taking part paraded through Leeds before taking to the stage at 
the city's new arena where 10,000 spectators watched a lavish opening 
ceremony.

Last year's winner, Britain's Chris Froome was cheered as he told the crowd he was relishing an 'amazing experience'.

And
 Mark Cavendish, who is hoping to secure the yellow jersey on Saturday 
afternoon in his mother's home town of Harrogate, was also given a 
hero's welcome.

Cavendish's
 big sprint rival Marcel Kittel, from Germany, charmed the arena when he
 talked about the 'awesome' welcome he has received in Yorkshire.

Sir
 Rodney Walker, Chair of TdFHUB2014 Ltd, the Government-created company 
overseeing the plans for the race, said the logistical preparations for 
the Tour are now all in place.

Sir
 Rodney said: 'All of the final pre-event plans are now being put into 
action so I'm delighted to be able to say we are ready to deliver a 
historic spectacle for huge audiences at the roadside and those watching
 around the world to enjoy.

'I
 would like to thank everyone involved for the tremendous work in 
getting us to this point. My final message would be to all the 
spectators to follow all of the event guidance carefully but most 
importantly have a fantastic time, as events like this do not come 
around very often and are very special.'

Yesterday, the
 Environment Agency had a single flood alert out for England and Wales, 
in place for the Upper River Loddon near Basingstoke, Hampshire.
