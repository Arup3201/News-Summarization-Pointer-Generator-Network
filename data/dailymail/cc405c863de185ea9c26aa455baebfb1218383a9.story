Harry Redknapp has reassured Queens Park Rangers fans by insisting he will sign a new contract imminently.

The R's boss revealed three weeks ago that a new two-year deal had been offered.

Although Redknapp has not signed on the dotted line yet, he remains relaxed about the situation and claims it is just a formality. 

QPR manager Harry Redknapp still hasn't signed a new  contact, but he insists he will do so soon

The former Tottenham manager said: 'Yes, I haven't signed it yet. I could do it today. I just need to get down to the ground and get it signed. It's all been drawn up.' 

Redknapp's side host Stoke this weekend and the 67-year-old  revealed that he has made moves to sign their striker Peter Crouch.

QPR are woefully short of options up front after losing Loic Remy to Chelsea during the summer transfer window.

On Crouch, Redknapp added: 'He started at QPR and I took him to Portsmouth from here.

'I've managed Crouch at most places I've been to.

'He's a player we've spoken about a few times - you'd always have Crouchy, he's a great bloke and a great player - but nothing came of it.' 

One player that Rangers were able to sign in the summer transfer window was midfielder Sandro, who arrived on deadline day for £10million from Tottenham, and Redknapp said Spurs  rejected 'four or five million more' from Russian club Zenit St Petersburg.

'I was surprised we were able to get him to be honest, and that he wasn't playing more,' said the one time West Ham manager.

'I think Tottenham turned down a big bid from Zenit just before the start of the season.

'It was certainly four or five million more than we paid for him.

'So I couldn't be more pleased to have him, he's a great character, a good lad and I think he'll be a great player for QPR.'

Redknapp added though the Sandro still needs time to reach full match fitness.

'I don't know long he'll need to be up to full speed,' said the Rangers boss.

'But he hadn't played at all and there's nothing like matches, until you get on the pitch you can't bring it all together.

'It's taking on the nerves, the adrenaline, all the training in the world doesn't compensate for playing in 90-minute games, and that's what several of them lacked.

'Sandro will be fitter against Stoke than he was last week and he's going to be a great player for us.'

Saturday's clash with the Potters also sees former Rangers manager Mark Hughes return to Loftus Road, and Redknapp said the Potters' boss must be held responsible for his unsuccessful spell at the club.

He said: 'Mark will take blame for what happened here - manager's have to. It didn't work out for him here, but that's football'
