Sheffield United have not closed the door on the return of rapist Ched Evans to Bramall Lane.

Sources on Saturday night distanced the club from reports suggesting a board-level decision will be taken on Sunday against offering the Wales striker a route back into the game in response to the backlash caused by his plan to resume training with United.

An unrepentant Evans, 25, was released from prison last month after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence. He remains in line to rejoin his former team-mates this week after the Blades answered a plea from the Professional Footballers’ Association.

Speaking after Saturday's 1-0 derby win at League One rivals Doncaster, Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said: ‘It’s been a difficult week and it’s great to finish it with three points after such adversity.

‘It’s not been easy for anybody at the club but all we can do is our bit on the pitch. We’ve not really sat down and discussed things in depth as a squad, but it’s affected everybody at the club.’ 

Sheffield United supporters remain split after a turbulent week that has seen sponsors threaten to pull out and Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill receive Twitter threats after demanding her name be removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evens is offered a contract.

In the first game since his potential return was announced, chants of ‘Super Ched Evans’ were quickly drowned out by a vocal group among the 4,250 travelling fans clearly against Evans’ return.

 

Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes near their Cheshire home on Thursday as it was revealed the convicted rapist did not rejoin former team-mates at United
