Scare: Neil E. Prescott, 28, made the alarming comments to colleagues last week at his workplace in Crofton, Maryland

An employee who called himself 'the joker' and allegedly threatened to 'shoot up his workplace' has been charged, authorities said.

Neil
E. Prescott, 28, raised the alarm after he made comments to a colleague last week.

He reportedly said: 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna 
load my guns and blow everybody up.'

The alarming remarks came a week after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado when a gunman entered a midnight showing at a movie theater and sprayed the audience with bullets.

Some 12 people died and 58 were injured in the massacre.

Prescott, of Crofton, Maryland, was facing charges of misdemeanor telephone misuse, prosecutors 
said today.

The offense carries up to three years in prison and a $500 fine.

Prescott was taken into custody last Friday for an emergency 
psychiatric evaluation after the threats were reported to the police.

Officers found large quantities of ammunition and about two 
dozen weapons, including semi-automatic rifles and pistols, in his 
Crofton apartment.

It was not immediately clear when the threat was to be carried out or how seriously it was meant to be taken, but the shooting in Colorado - coupled with the 'Joker' reference - put police especially on edge and gave the comments extra urgency, officials said.

Prince George's County 
State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said that while the misdemeanor 
charge was 'insufficient' punishment, Maryland law does not make it a 
felony to communicate general threats over the telephone.

She said her 
office would be lobbying for a change in the law.

Alsobrooks 
said: 'I believe that when people like Mr Prescott threaten violence, especially
in this day and age with all that we have going on right now, he ought 
to be facing felony charges - not just misdemeanor charges.'

Though authorities have determined the 
guns were legally owned, Prescott will not be eligible to recover the 
weapons while the case is pending.

He also won't be able to get the guns
back if he's convicted or if he's hospitalized for mental health 
treatment for more than 30 days, she said.

Authorities
have said Prescott had either been fired or was in the process of being
fired from his job when he allegedly made the remarks.

Police have said the threats, 
relayed in two separate conversations last Monday, were made to aÂ  co-worker.

Police also said Prescott was 
wearing a T-shirt that said 'Guns don't kill people. I do' when officers
made an initial visit to his apartment, at which point Prescott 
appeared 'unstable'.

Officers haven't been able to interview 
Prescott in the hospital, but police believe the threats needed to be 
taken seriously, in part because of the 'joker' reference and the 
weapons' caches.

Prescott will be served with the charges after he's 
discharged from the hospital.

The 28-year-old had been working for a subcontractor of software and mailroom supplier 
Pitney Bowes at a branch in Prince George's County, just outside 
Washington.

A company spokeswoman said he had not been on company 
property for several months.

After he was 
taken into custody, friends described Prescott as a 'gentle giant' - 
court records list him as 6 feet, 7 inches - who has a sarcastic and 
biting sense of humor.

They said he was interested in computers and 
electronics, collected guns as a hobby and liked to shoot at a target 
range.

Phone messages left with his parents 
have not been returned. Online Maryland court records list his only 
past offense as a speeding ticket in 2007.
