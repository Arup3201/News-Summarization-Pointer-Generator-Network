Killed: Schoolboy Radwan Uddin, nine, was playing with his brother when he was struck by uninsured driver Ibrahim Waseem, 23

An uninsured driver who killed a nine-year-old boy playing on his bike with his older brother has been jailed for 21 months.

Ibrahim Waseem, 23, was driving at nearly double the speed limit when he struck schoolboy Radwan Uddin, who was riding on the handlebars of his older brother’s bicycle, near a park. 

In the force of the crash, the nine-year-old was thrown into the windscreen of the silver Mazda and up into the air, before he landed in the middle of the road.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that Marks & Spencer worker Waseem then hit a parked black Peugeot so hard it was hurled 20 feet down the road.

Paramedics rushed to the scene and Radwan was taken to Great Ormond Street hospital.

However he suffered catastrophic head injuries and died soon after.

The court was told that Waseem got out of his Mazda 3 and ran away, but was chased to his nearby home.

He then called a solicitor, and turned himself in to Freshwater police station that evening.

Waseem sobbed throughout his police interview and said he thought he was going at 20-25mph when he hit the bike in East Ham, east London.

In fact his speed was a minimum of 39 mph in the 20mph zone, the court was told.

Waseem, of East Ham, London, admitted causing death by careless driving following the incident on June 26, 2012.

He claimed he had become a recluse since the incident and only manages to get out to go to his job at Marks & Spencer.

Sentence: Waseem was jailed for 21 months after he admitted causing death by careless driving at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured

Judge Judith Hughes QC said: ‘This is far from an easy case in which to sentence because it is a tragedy for you and a tragedy for the victim’s family.

‘Clearly things can be said on both sides and it will not help the family to hear that the child was on the handlebars and that the older brother had been going down the road the wrong way.

‘But unfortunately the fact is that you Waseem were going too fast and if you had been going less quickly the consequences might have been different.

‘Clearly the speed and having no insurance are aggravating features but I accept you are extremely remorseful and take full responsibility for what has happened.’

Judge Hughes sentenced Waseem to 21 months in prison and disqualified him from driving for at least 12 months until he passes another driving test.
