Bus drivers in Seattle were forced to wear diapers or carry a jar with them on their route because access to toilets was so bad, a report has claimed.

Drivers' restrooms were not open all hour buses run and some routes did not have toilets within walking distance of bus stops, forcing drivers to wet themselves or urinate in a bottle.

King County Metro Transit had to replace 60 urine-soaked driver's seats in a year and have been fined for not providing facilities for their workers.

At times, drivers who went to search for toilets were subsequently punished for running late, according to a report from the Department of Labor and Industries.

King County Metro Transit also failed to ensure Othello Station, Rainier Valley, had running water, paper towels and soap for six years, the Seattle Times reported.

Drivers may have put passengers at risk by holding it in and losing their composure at the wheel because of the lack of bathroom facilities and could have also damaged their kidneys.

Speaking to transport magazine Crosscut, Metro operator Hal Poor said: 'We’ve had drivers wear Depends diapers [a brand of adult diaper]. We’ve had operators carry a jar for urination.

'We’ve got pregnant women who are still driving. You know what kind of pressure that puts on your bladder. We have gentlemen 60 or older. They can’t hold it anymore.'

Drivers get a five-minute break between runs and are supposed to have 15-minute break every five hours - but Mr Poor in reality breaks of this length are few and far between.

'How guaranteed is the 15-minute break if you want to stay on schedule and you’re 12 minutes late?' he asked.

'It’s on paper, but if you get caught in traffic, it doesn’t mean you’re getting it.' 

King County Metro Transit was ordered to pay a $3,500 fine by December 22 and come up with a plan to tackle the problem.

Kevin Desmond, Metro’s general manager, said the fine was a wake-up call. He said: 'I would not characterize this as a program failure or a management failure. We learn as people help us see issues we’re challenged with.'
