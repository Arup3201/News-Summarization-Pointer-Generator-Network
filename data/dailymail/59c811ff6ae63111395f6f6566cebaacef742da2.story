These stark pictures show a Romanian caravan park located just outside the city of Hogdalen, Stockholm.

There are around 30 similar settlements in the area where shacks, dilapidated caravans and tents serve as people's temporary homes.

There are approximately six mobile homes and several more primitive homemade shacks in the make-shift town.

A resident walks through some of the caravans in the site as night falls. There are 30 similar sites to this in the Hogdalen area

None of the homes have running water, electricity or cooking facilities.

Romanian Viorica Vaduva, 42, who is four months pregnant, lives in the shanty town.

She previously work as a maid in Spain before the financial crisis  - but now survives through begging on the streets of Stockholm.

She says moving to the country was a last resort. She added: 'At home there are no jobs, we have no other options'.

Washing can be seen hanging from a make-shift washing line and strewn on the floor in the centre of the site

It is thought the increase in the number of such towns in the area is down to a recent relaxing of migrant laws

The mother is the sole means of support for her parents and her 8-year-old daughter, all of whom live in Romania.

She said: 'Everyone who lives here begging. Some of the men have construction jobs during the summer'.

'We usually go into the city at eight thirty. I have no fixed place but sit in different places in the city'.

The mother uses an oil drum to burn a fire - which she both cooks on and uses to heat her caravan.

She says it is often it is impossible to start a fire due to damp wood.

All EU citizens have the right to reside freely in another EU country for three months.

But the camps are often built on private land where the owner can enforce eviction.

The result sees groups of people who are legally residing in the country move from one illegal settlement to another.

In mid-December last year authorities closed one such tent camp, which was home to around 50 people.

Campaigner Bienvenido Flores comments: "It is a very strange situation. On one hand police run these people out but on the other hand they are in great need of help.

Lat December, Swedish authorities closed a similar site that housed 50 people. Many of these sites are on private land and are therefore illegal

Although those living in the sites are in the country legally, as they are living on private land they are often moved on by police
