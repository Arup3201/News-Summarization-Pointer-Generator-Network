In a surprise verdict the driver behind the wheel of the horrific Bronx bus crash that killed 15 passengers last year walked out of court a free man with only a $500 fine - $33 for each life.

A jury found Ophadell Williams not guilty of 53 counts of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault - leaving survivors and relatives of those killed fuming in disgust.

'He’s still responsible for the crash since he was the driver,' said a shocked Florence Wong, whose 76-year-old father, Don Lee, was killed in the crash. 'He’s still responsible for the lives.'

Ophadel Williams bows his head in relief after his not-guilty verdict is read out in court in the Bronx on Friday

Another man who lost an in-law in the tragic predawn March 2011 accident said, 'Obviously, 15 lives were lost and no one's going to pay criminally. It's an outrage.'

As the verdict was read out in the Bronx court room - Williams who had faced 15-years in prison held his head in his hands as it became clear he was going to walk away a free man.

The 41-year-old Brooklyn resident was convicted of one minor charge of aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle for which he has already served time - and his wife wept as she realised her husband would not go to prison.

Turning to his lawyer Patrick Bruno, Williams' eyes welled up with tears and he whispered 'Thank you'.

After the verdict was announced, Williams was taken into a holding room without his handcuffs and allowed to return home.

'It was a very difficult decision to make,' said one unidentified juror to the New York Post.

In March 2011, Williams claimed that he lost control of the bus he was driving from New York to Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut after he was cut off on the I-95 bu a tractor-trailer.

Prosecutors said Williams, whose driving record included 18 suspensions over two decades, was tired when his speeding bus hit a guardrail, flipped onto its side and skidded into a highway sign pole, shearing off the roof. Of 32 passengers, 15 died and 15 were injured, some severely.

Defense attorney Patrick Bruno cheered the verdict. He said the jury realized that Williams was 'a fall guy for a horrendous accident.'

When the bus careered off the road at approximately 5.40 a.m. on March 12th survivors recalled screaming with fear as a signpost tore through the vehicle.

However, for some, the verdict was a travesty of justice.

'I do not agree with the verdict,' said Florence Wong, the daughter of a passenger killed in the accident to the New York Daily News.

'Williams is still responsible for the lives lost. I don't believe the truck cut him off. There was no physical evidence that the truck made contact. He was responsible. He was driving the bus.'

In the aftermath of the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board determined that Williams was motoring along the freeway at 78 mph in a 50 mph zone.

The bus 'black box' revealed that Williams never attempted to hit the brakes to avoid the vehicle and never made contact with the tractor.

Passengers who survived testified that Williams was weaving between lanes and changing speeds, which Williams' attorney said was due to his client driving through construction zones and speed traps.

One witness told the court that she thought the vehicle was a 'party bus' due to the speed it was being driven at.

'We believe that our case was compelling; nevertheless we accept the decision of the jury,' said DA Robert Johnson in a statement.

Patrick Bruno, Williams' attorney said that the former bus driver felt terrible about the accident.

In June, the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the incident and decided that driver fatigue had been the most likely cause.

There reasons being that Williams had had almost no sleep over the past three days prior to the crash/

Indicted in September 2011 for criminal charges relating to the accident, Williams was held in prison on $250,000 throughout the trial.

Lawsuits seeking millions of dollars have already been filed against Williams by victims and their families, said Bruno, saying the case belongs in civil court, not criminal court.

Assistant Bronx District Attorney Gary Weil said he was disappointed by the verdict.

'Everyone said it was a tough case because everyone falls asleep at the wheel at some point,' he told colleagues as he left the court.
