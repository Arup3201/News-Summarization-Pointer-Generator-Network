Jude Law is set to become a father for the fifth time.

The 41-year-old actor and his ex-girlfriend Catherine Harding are set to welcome their first child together into the world early next year. 

Despite their split, the exes are determined to put everything into raising the baby.

A representative for the star told People: 'I can confirm that Jude Law and Catherine Harding are expecting a child together in the spring.

'Whilst they are no longer in a relationship, they are both wholeheartedly committed to raising their child.

'They consider this a private matter and other than this confirmation no statement will be made.

'I ask that you respect the privacy of all parties involved and their families.'

The Holiday star already has three children, sons Rafferty, 18; and Rudy, 12; and daughter Iris, 13; with his ex-wife Sadie Frost, who he divorced in 2003, who he shares custody with.

He also has a five-year-old daughter, Sophia, with American model Samantha Burke following a brief fling in 2008.

This latest development is somewhat of a surprise as Jude has been mostly single over the past few years.

He was last linked to actress Ruth Wilson until earlier this year after they often photographed together, although she insisted they were 'just friends'.

In 2008 - before his fling with Samantha - Jude was photographed kissing Rod Stewart's socialite daughter Kimberly, who has since gone to have a child with Benicio Del Toro.

Aside from his wife Sadie, Jude's most high-profile romance was his on-off relationship with Sienna Miller.

The couple met on the set of Alfie in 2003 shortly after his separation from Sadie, with the actor proposing on Christmas Day 2004.

However, their romance was rocked when in July 2005 it was revealed he had had an affair with his former children's nanny Daisy Wright four months earlier while filming in the US.

The actor publicly apologised at the time, saying: 'I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us.

'I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused.

'There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.' 

Although Sienna ditched her engagement ring, they tried to salvage their relationship, eventually splitting in November 2006.

The pair then rekindled their romance in December 2009 after starring in different Broadway plays at the same time.

However, just weeks after buying a home together in North London the pair split for good in February 2011.

Sienna started dating her now-fiance Tom Sturridge just a month later and they now have a two-year-old daughter Marlowe together. 

Jude admitted five years ago that becoming a father shifted his priorities in life and gave him a wake-up call.

He said in 2009: 'Being a daddy is what counts. I used to sleep until noon, but it's not so bad to have to get up at 7 and give them breakfast.

'My daughter made me realise that if there's anything that's going to make a man of you, it's having your will broken by a little girl.'

Meanwhile, Jude’s eldest son, Rafferty, this week spoke of the pressures of having a famous dad.

The budding musician, who calls himself Raff as ‘I don’t really like the name Rafferty’, is in a band called The Dirty Harrys.

Of not following in his father’s footsteps, he told the London Evening Standard: ‘I did feel a bit of pressure when I joined my first boarding school [Bedales in Hampshire].

‘In my drama lesson, I think everyone thought: "Oh God, he’s going to be so brilliant". Then they realised that I wasn’t that good, so they just let me get on with it.’

He said meeting Blur and The Clash through his parents had helped him forge a music career, adding: ‘I did work experience for Blur for two weeks when they were rehearsing for their reunion gig, because Damon [Albarn] is really good friends with my dad. I tuned their guitars and stuff.’
