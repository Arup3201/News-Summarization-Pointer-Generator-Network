More men fake it than you might think, with 10 admitting they have deceived their partner in bed

Today may be National Orgasm Day but instead of jumping under the duvet and indulging in some unbridled passion, a large number of Brits will be feeling more 'uh oh' than the big O between the sheets tonight.

Despite the recent resurgence of sexual liberty thanks to the erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, among other things, it seems that pleasure is staying firmly on the page when it comes to women’s sex lives, with 58 per cent of women admitting to faking an orgasm at least once during their relationship.

And out of the women who admit faking it between the sheets, a whopping 93 per cent said they had faked it more than once.

It is not just the ladies who are feigning pleasure during sex either, as 10 per of men admit to faking an orgasm 'regularly' too.

The main reason men admit to pretending to climax is to ‘avoid hurting their partner’s feelings’ (40 per cent) or they’re simply ‘too tired’ (35 per cent) to fully let go.

Interestingly it seems that men are more open to the idea of feigning their climax than women.

More men (72 per cent) who have never feigned a climax would consider doing it in the future, compared to 63 per cent of women who have never faked it.

Women, it would seem, are generally none the wiser to their partner's devious ways with only 16 per cent ever having suspected that their other half was faking it, despite 50 per cent of men in a relationship and 35 per cent of married men admitting they faking orgasm regularly

In contrast men, perhaps justifiably, have suspicious minds when it comes to their partner between the sheets, with over 58 per cent of men reporting they suspect that their partner has put on act in bed.

Unsurprisingly, more men rate their sex drive as 'high' than women

The survey, conducted by Ann Summers, also found a distinct divide between the North and the South of the UK with the south reporting a much higher rate of faking than their northern equivalents.

Women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers.

And the geographic difference also applies to men with males from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent).

But not all is lost – when it comes to having the most orgasms – single men have it the best, with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 50 per cent of partnered-up men.

More women orgasm alone than men, getting slightly fewer big-Os from their partner than  men

For women though, married life equals more orgasms. Only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 59 per cent of those in a relationship and 28 per cent of singletons.

Although many women are left high and dry between the sheets, over 40 per cent of men would feel concerned about their other half if they faked it and said they would ‘talk it through with their partner to find out what the real problem is’ if they caught their other half putting on an act. 

However, if you are ever tempted to fake the big O – screaming the bedroom door down is the biggest giveaway (52 per cent) followed by making loud noises (37 per cent) and crying (24 per cent).

Orgasm frequency

 

Forget love and companionship, for 
one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the 
sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in 
bed.

Hitting the spot 
is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate 
having regular orgasms more highly than being in love.

But
 despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships, less 
than half of Britons admitted they were 'very happy' with how often they
 orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk.

It's over: 39 per cent of Brits said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break-up

They quizzed 3800 British men 
and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women 
would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner, with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor.

Although
 60 per cent said they were 'very happy' when asked to rate their 
relationship in general, this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 
per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their 
relationship.

When asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm, tiredness was the most common cause 
with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men. Self-esteem 
issues ranked second for women followed by 'lack of sexual 
desire'.

For 15 per cent of men, hitting the booze caused a problem in the
 bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing, while job worries affect 12 per cent of men.

Relax: Sex expert Joanna Coker said couples should have more fun and not get hung up on achieving the 'big O'

One in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex. As a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm.

Joanna Coker, sex expert for Bondara.co.uk, said couples should try not to get so 'hung up' on achieving an orgasm.

She said: 'While having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex, making love can still be enjoyable without the big 'O'.

'Try
 not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation 
worse. The ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this
 survey shows, to be at your sexual peak keep healthy, try not to get 
overtired and avoid too much alcohol.'

Ms
 Coker added that the old adage of 'never going to bed on an argument' 
is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples shouldn't be 
afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets.

'Misunderstandings
 and conflicts can all affect your sexual life; it is hard to feel 
carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner. 
If you're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them, 
leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life,' she said.

Bondara conducted their research to mark next week's 'National Orgasm Day' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom.

For 47 per cent of women, spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex (38 per cent) and introducing sex toys (35 per cent).

For
 men, more oral sex (54 per cent) was a must, followed by spending more 
time on foreplay (43 per cent), introducing sex toys (42 per cent) and 
changing sexual positions (38 per cent). 

A separate survey by Ann Summers revealed how the sex lives of Brits varies around the country.

They
 found that men from the South East, aged between 25-34, who are in a 
relationship and have sex several times a week, fake an orgasm more 
regularly than sexually active, male singletons. 

Men from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared 
to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent). 

Meanwhile, women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North 
East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern 
counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) 
and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers.

Their poll of 500 people found that when it comes to having the most orgasms – single 
men have it the best, with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 
50 per cent of those in a loving relationship.

In
 contrast for women, married life equals more orgasms, as only 12 per 
cent pretend in bed compared to 28 per cent of singletons.
