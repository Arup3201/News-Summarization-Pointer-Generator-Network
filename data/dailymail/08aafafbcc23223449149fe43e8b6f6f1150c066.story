A grieving husband notched up four speeding tickets and named his dead wife as the driver, a court heard.

Christopher Bingley was caught speeding four times in 2010 and 2011 in his wife Joanne's Jeep Cherokee car, but had the points credited to Mrs Bingley's licence, it is alleged.

Mr Bingley, 44, who set up a charity in memory of his wife, is alleged to have named Mrs Bingley as the driver during the offences, even though she committed suicide several months earlier.

Mrs Bingley, 39, was killed when she threw herself in front of a train near Huddersfield in April 2010 following a battle with post-natal depression.

Bingley blamed his wife’s death on post-natal depression (PND) and set up a charity to highlight the illness in February last year.

Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard father-of-one Mr Bingley continued to drive his late wife's Jeep Cherokee car and when caught speeding had the points credited to her licence.

The first count against Mr Bingley alleges that on April 14, 2011, Bingley falsely completed speeding notices addressed to his wife regarding offences on February 20, 2011 and April 9, 2011.

The widower was also accused of the same offence for a speeding ticket on August 2, 2010 and the third count relates to speeding on August 6, 2010.

Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard Mr Bingley used his dead wife's name after being caught speeding four times in Huddersfield in 2010 and 2011

No indication of plea was made and the case was adjoured to Bradford Crown Court on March 28.

Mr Bingley, a management consultant, has spoken about how his wife struggled with severe depression following the birth of their baby daughter Emily.

He launched the Joanne (Joe) Bingley Memorial Foundation to highlight the illness and support those affected by it and also produced a leaflet to outline international guidelines on PND as he claimed local guidance was inadequate.

He said he blamed health professionals for Joanne’s death and said she could have been cured if she had been admitting to hospital.

An inquest into her death ruled she had not been neglected.
