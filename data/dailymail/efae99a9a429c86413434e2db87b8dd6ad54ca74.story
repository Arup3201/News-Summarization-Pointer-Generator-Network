ON YOUR MARKS...One week to go before the hold button is pressed on normal life. Seven days of dreams and expectation followed by a month of ecstasy, agony, and the tricky job of fitting in three games a day round sleeping and eating and doing the occasional bit of work.

So here are ten reasons why the 2014 World Cup could be the best, yet.

Well – Brazil (the place), obviously

The land of coffee, smiley beautiful people and samba football. It would be hard to pick a more glamorous host nation. No kid grows up wanting to play for Germany (unless you’re German, of course). Every kid (even Germans) wants to be Pele. Tricks and flicks are copyright Brazilian, after all.

The stage is set: Two Rio icons, the Christ the Redeemer statue and the Maracana Stadium, venue for the World Cup final on July 13

Finishing touches: A sand sculpture marks the start of the World Cup on Copacabana Beach in Rio

Up for grabs: The famous World Cup trophy next to the adidas Brazuca ball on the pitch at the Maracana

Neymar

With all the furore over the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry, it has been easy to overlook the Brazilian with the dodgy haircut, who has had an up-and-down season at Barcelona. Only now he is back home, a stage on which he has tended to excel.

The signs are that Brazil will play a pragmatic game. Big Phil Scolari is not a flamboyant manager. But Neymar has a box of tricks at his disposal and the tendency to do his own thing. Should be fun to watch.

Back home: Brazil's Neymar is predicted to be the star of the World Cup

Shine a light: The Barcelona star is a stylish Brazilian player in a pragmatic team led by Luis Felipe Scolari

Messi v Ronaldo

Difficult to ignore but the constant comparison of Real Madrid’s Portugeezer Ronaldo and Barcelona’s Leo is beginning to wear a little thin. The common perception is that Messi has had a disappointing season when the truth is that he has not had a stand-out one.

Narcissist Ronaldo has a Champions League medal and will be looking for as many reasons as possible to rip off his shirt and display his six pack to the world. He does know he will get booked, doesn’t he?

Star turn: Lionel Messi knows it's time to perform on the greatest stage for Argentina

Put your shirt on him: We're bound to see more of Cristiano Ronaldo's six pack during the World Cup

No vuvuzelas and no England band

An over-riding memory of South Africa four years ago was the loud (ok, deafening) sound of a million angry hornets courtesy of the vuvuzela.

FIFA decided that this year’s official ‘noise maker’ would be a caxirola – for sale at all good World Cup outlets.

There is just one flaw. The caxirola has been banned from all 12 stadiums because it doubles up as an aerodynamic missile.

Still, it’s not all bad news because the ban on anything musical means the England brass band is silenced for the first time since France 1998.

Silenced: We will at least be spared the infernal racket of the vuvuzela out in Brazil

Not today, thank you: The England band will be absent from the tournament after the ban on musical instruments

Roy Hodgson

I know. England coaches tend not to be flavour of the month during big tournaments but Hodgson has brought reality to the whole crazy national expectation. He talks sense, does not give a damn how he is portrayed in the media and it looks like he has convinced the players too.

Lest we forget, this is a man who was drummed out of Merseyside because he was not regarded as ‘big enough’ for Liverpool and, supposedly, the players. The Anfield mob with England seem fine with him.

Unfazed: Roy Hodgson leads England into the World Cup with expectations pretty low

The 3 Cs – Copacabana, Caipirinha, Coxinha

Bare-footed boys playing football on the sand, watched by bikini-clad beauties. It can mean only one thing – welcome to the Copacabana. Here’s a prediction...we’ll be seeing a lot of the most famous stretch of beach in the world over the next month. 

Here’s another prediction, just like Pimm’s at Wimbledon, England’s hostelries are likely to be offering the deadly caipirinha – a cocktail with a sting in the tail.

To those lucky enough to be out there, coxinha - a deep-fried chicken and cheese delight – is the equivalent of your meat and potato pie.

Brazilian dream: A local player perfects his bicycle kicks on the soft sand of Copacabana Beach in Rio

Golden days: A game of football in progress on Ipanema Beach in Rio, with the silhouette of Sugar Loaf mountain in the background

Gary Lineker

No stranger to our screens at World Cup time but the Match of the Day host’s wonderfully laconic style tends to set the tone for the rest of the BBC team. He’s been there and done it as a player and he’s been there and done it as presenter. As an added bonus, he will be tweeting too.

Laconic: Gary Lineker will be fronting the BBC's coverage of the World Cup

No wags

It might be two World Cups ago now, but the image of Baden-Baden is not yet erased from the memory banks. Footballers’ wives do nothing for a football tournament other than act as magnets for paparazzi. Taking the missus/mister to work tends not to go down that well in most jobs and that’s what the England team are doing, after all.

Never again: England WAGs out and about in Baden Baden, Germany during the 2006 World Cup

Pele

Three-time winner, four-time finalist, the greatest player to grace the game. And the World Cup will be in his manor, which means lots of excuses to show nostalgia clips of the ‘old days’. Pele in his pomp will be a reminder to the new generation just how high he set the bar.

Legend: We'll hopefully be seeing plenty of Pele when the tournament kicks off in Brazil

Steven Gerrard

World Cups are all about fairytales and no-one deserves a happy ending like the England and Liverpool skipper. This is likely to be his last tournament and only the coming weeks will show whether the effort – mental and physical – of last season will prove too much for the midfielder. But whatever happens to England, let’s hope Stevie G flies home with his head held high.

Captain, leader... Will there be a fairytale ending for Steven Gerrard and England at the World Cup?
