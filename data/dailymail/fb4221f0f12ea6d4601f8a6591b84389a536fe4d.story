This is the moment a father tried to help his police officer son escape after he shot a man during an off-duty bar fight. 

Salome Rodriguez, 23, died from multiple gunshot wounds after Henry Solis turned on him outside a nightclub in Pomona, California,  on March 13.

The 27-year-old probationary LAPD officer fled the scene to go to his father's house, an affidavit from an FBI agent claims.

Victor Solis (left in both pictures) was charged with making false statements yesterday after CCTV footage (above) showed him helping his son cross the border into Mexico. Henry Solis (right in both pictures) shot a man outside a nightclub in Pomona, California, on March 13

Victor Solis alleged his son was at his house because he needed to be dropped at a bus shelter to undertake five days of vacation in El Paso, Texas. 

The FBI said the pair walked to Juarez, Mexico, from El Paso just one day after the murder.

Solis claimed he crossed the border into Mexico alone - but surveillance footage showed him crossing with his son, the affidavit reported.

The 53-year-old was arrested at his Lancaster house yesterday and charged with making false statements. He has agreed to be transferred to Texas.

A $25,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of Solis Jr. 

A wanted poster states that the former marine 'allegedly pursued the victim on foot and shot him multiple times, killing him'.

A warrant added that authorities spoke to family, friends and witnesses who told them Solis Jr. had spoken about the murder.

It said: 'Shortly after the murder, defendant Solis made incriminating statements about his role in the murder of Rodriguez and stated that he would never be seen again.'

Charlie Beck, Los Angeles Police Chief, fired the probationary officer from the department on Tuesday 17 March.

A funeral service for Mr Rodriguez, from Ontario, was held on Thursday.
