Australia may be heading into the World Cup as firm favourites but underneath the tranquil surface trouble is brewing.

Michael Clarke, Australia’s injured captain, is said to be at war with selectors, while his team-mates are believed to want golden boy Steve Smith to be their captain in all forms of the game.

All the mutterings of discontent surrounding the World Cup hosts’ captaincy were thrown into the open on Tuesday by a report in the Sydney Morning Herald.

In a crisis which could be as damaging for Australia as the sacking of Kevin Pietersen proved for England, Clarke could find his return in time for the World Cup blocked because of his ‘broken relationships’ with those in power and, crucially, his own team. 

He is a figure who has divided opinion after controversies involving his private life, the ‘homework-gate’ affair in India and his strained relationship with players, notably Shane Watson.

A report by Herald chief sports writer Andrew Webster is acknowledged by those close to the Australian camp as being spot on. 

It is suggested that Clarke, who has been battling back and hamstring problems, has been on a collision course with selectors since November, when they planned to leave him out of the Brisbane Test against India in favour of Phillip Hughes.

That plan had to be shelved when the young batsman was fatally hit by a bouncer while playing in a Sheffield Shield match. 

Clarke earned the respect of the cricketing world for the statesmanship he showed then but now he is battling for his cricketing future as he attempts to prove his fitness for the World Cup by February 21, a deadline set by the selectors. 

Clarke is said to be furious about the deadline and expected longer to complete his very public return to fitness, which included him lapping the sodden SCG while rain washed out play between Australia and India on Monday.

The suspicion is that the selectors are hoping that he fails and they will be able to plan for a future without Clarke and under a captain in Smith in a rich vein of form.

George Bailey will lead Australia in the World Cup should Clarke be ruled out but Smith is the future and was exceptional while standing in for Clarke against India. 

England had a gruelling training session in the extreme heat of Perth, aware of the speculation gripping the old enemy but determined not to be distracted. ‘Whatever team Australia put out against us is going to be a strong one,’ said assistant coach Paul Farbrace. ‘We saw that in Hobart when they made a few changes.

‘They have a lot of high-quality cricketers and someone like Mitchell Starc has stood up because Mitchell Johnson is not here. So what goes on in the Australia camp is no business of ours.’
