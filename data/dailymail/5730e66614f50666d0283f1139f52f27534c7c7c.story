Just when you thought Kim Kardashian's infamous butt-baring magazine cover had been parodied to death here comes the New York Metropolitan Museum with an slightly different take on things.

On Thursday the Met tweeted its own pic of an ample-bottomed sculpture that bears a striking resemblance to the one that's got so much attention over the past 48 hours. 

'Here at the Met, we have artworks that can #BreakTheInternet too!' read the tweet, which even adopted the hashtag that has been blowing up on social media since Paper magazine revealed the cover of its winter issue.

The photo attached to the tweet shows an ancient fertility symbol that predates Kim by about 6,500 years, although the Steatopygous female figure is slightly shorter at 8.4 inches tall.

The Met's cheeky attempt at generating some publicity has been retweeted more than 2,000 times since it was posted on Thursday morning.

'Bless whoever wrote this Tweet. It deserves an actual visit to the Met to see this,' tweeted @MaazaMengiste.

While @AngryHusky joked, 'That's obviously the only way they had in ancient times (b4 cellphones) to capture the beauty of Walmart shoppers'. 

Mythical beast: One internet user turned Kim Kardashian into a beautiful centaur in a hilarious meme - after seeing her naked shoot for Paper magazine 

The original: Kim Kardashian certainly lit up the internet after her lewd shoot came out 

Now that's an eyebrow raiser! The stunner also posted a super racy naked snap of her body from the front 

Within hours of posting the image of her oiled-up, Photoshop-enhanced behind on Tuesday, the internet had gone to town with people inspired to create their own versions of the pic including everything from centaurs to docking stations.

Kim may have wanted to 'break the internet' but it seems she united the online world in finding the most comical way of parodying the lewd cover - she also posed for a full frontal snap inside.

Twitter user @KelKulus was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the Paper magazine image, tweeting his own version with the caption: 'Kim Kardashian looks so much like a centaur in Paper Magazine, I figured I'd take it one step further.'

Kim's rear becomes the rump of a horse, turning the reality star into a centaur, who certainly wouldn't have been booted out of the Forbidden Forest.

The wife of Kanye West was then given the capital treatment by @AngryBritain, who joked that the Barclays Cycle Hire Docking Stations have been given a bootylicious makeover.

Having a laugh: Entourage star Adrien Grenier spoofed the picture by superimposing his head onto her body

@GeneralBoles killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping Russell Brand's face onto Kim's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming 'PARKLIFE!'

Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons.

Brits do it better: Kim is compared to Pippa Middleton

'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate. 

Pippa Middleton wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister's Royal Wedding was also used as a comparision, though really the Brits behind didn't really 'do it better' than Kim. 

Another tweeter highlighted the mother-of-one's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids. 

Now that's a brand: The star's pert posterior symbolises the double O in Google in one sexy meme

The user also gave Kim a surrealist makeover by Photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact. 

One user even compared the image of Kim to that of a Barbie doll, as @SarahKhalegh pointed out: 'Kim Kardashian literally looks like a plastic &unrealistic Barbie doll. Look at her waist in comparison to her body.'

It does seem the magazine have done their best to Photoshop the reality star's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than James's Giant Peach.

Bin thinking: The star stands in a rubbish bag in another spoofy moment

Just under a fortnight ago, Kim stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband Kanye at the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honouring Quentin Tarantino and Barbara Kruger.

Of course the rapper, who only follows Kim on Twitter, tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag '#ALLDAY'. 

However Kim didn't get exactly what she wanted... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine.

Curvier: At the start of the month, Kim's waist looked more natural than on the Paper magazine cover

Support: Of course Kanye had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife
