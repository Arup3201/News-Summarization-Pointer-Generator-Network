Japanese scientists have launched a sperm bank for endangered animals in the hope of one day recreating animal populations on other planets.

Using freeze-drying technology, the researchers have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates and a type of giraffe.

The long-term aim of the breakthrough is to take genetic information into space and spread animal populations among future colonies.

The team at Kyoto University's Institute of Laboratory Animals Graduate School of Medicine, mixed the sperm of the endangered creatures with special preservation liquid.

They then freeze-dried it in a way that allows them to store it at just 4 degrees Celsius, according to associate professor Takehito Kaneko, who led the experiment.

The temperature is much higher and less energy intensive than conventional ways of storing sperm.

Professor Kaneko and his researchers have previously successfully freeze-dried sperm from rats and mice without the use of bulky liquid nitrogen equipment and were able to prove the viability of the spermatozoa up to five years later.

'In this way, scientists will be able to obtain genetic information more easily, which means we could help to preserve endangered animal species, he said.

Professor Kaneko is quick to point out that there is presently no human application for the technology, but adds it is an avenue that may be explored in the future.

'This may sound like a dream, but we could in future take genetic information into space,' he said, adding it may allow for the transfer of material to help establish animal populations on future colonies.

More immediately, the technology makes it possible to store sperm at room temperature for short periods, meaning it would be safe in the event of power failures caused by a natural disaster, for example.

The challenge now, said Professor Kaneko, is to develop a way to apply the method to the other side of the procreative equation.

'Now we have to use fresh eggs or those frozen conventionally [and] we are studying methods to freeze-dry eggs as well.'
