The attorney for a couple accused of abandoning the adopted nine-year-old son they raised since infancy said on Wednesday that the boy has gotten some much-needed help.

Anthony VanNoy, attorney for Cleveland and Lisa Cox, said after a brief pretrial hearing that the couple are visiting with the boy and hope to be reunited with him.

The Coxes have pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of nonsupport of dependents, and VanNoy said they won't accept a plea deal.

Lisa Cox, 52, and her husband Cleveland, 49, of Liberty Township, arrive for a hearing at Butler County Common Pleas Court at the Government Services Center in Hamilton, Ohio, on Wednesday

The trial is scheduled for Feb. 10. The charges allege the couple recklessly abandoned or failed to provide adequate support for the boy. 

Authorities say the pair, from Butler County's Liberty Township, left the boy with children's services after saying he was displaying aggressive behavior and earlier threatened the family with a knife.

‘The whole goal of the context of children services has always been to get help for the child,’ VanNoy said Wednesday.

He says the Coxes have received many letters of support.

‘The blessing is that there has been an awareness of people that there are families that are struggling and they need help,’ VanNoy said.

Well-to-do: The couple live in this lovely neighborhood where the median income is around $100,000. They had raised their son since he was three months old

Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser wouldn't comment on specifics of the case on Wednesday but said he was encouraged by VanNoy's remarks.

‘One always hopes in a long process such as this that there is a silver lining,’ Gmoser said.

Documents filed by the prosecutor say the parents didn't tell the boy when they left him with children's services that he wouldn't be returning home.

The Coxes could each face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the single count against each of them.

Adolfo Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the boy's interests, has said the emotionally hurt and confused child is now receiving help that the parents should have gotten for him.

Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township

Threatening? Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' The couple claims the boy has threatened them with a knife

A defence attorney and prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. The couple was scheduled to be in juvenile court later overnight for a pretrial hearing regarding custody of the child.

People within the adoption community say they worry about emotional trauma to the child. They say giving up a child after so much time is rare and undermines the stability and commitment that adopted children need.

The median annual income in the region where the parents live is more than $100,000, and the median home value is more than $280,000, according to census data.
