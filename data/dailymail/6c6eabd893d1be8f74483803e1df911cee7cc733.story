The father of a six-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and murdered by their 17-year-old neighbor earlier this month said he has already forgiven the teen.

James Wright, whose daughter Jenise was found a muddy bog near their Bremerton, Washington home several days after she vanished on August 2, said that Gabriel Gaeta made a bad decision.

'Gabe was tempted by the fallen,' Wright, a member of the Latter-Day Saints who has previously faced child molestation charges of his own, told the Kitsap Sun.

'With the free will given by our 
Father, he chose wrong. I've already forgiven him.'

Gaeta is jailed on investigation of first-degree murder and rape in the case, but prosecutors
 are awaiting a competency review before charging him. He is 
expected to be tried as an adult.

Staying strong: James Wright, pictured with his wife Denise, said he has forgiven the 17-year-old neighbor accused of sexually assaulting and killing their six-year-old daughter Jenise earlier this month

Wright, a member of the Church of the Latter-Day Saints, said Gaeta had been 'part of the family' and previously welcomed into their lively home in the Steele Creek Mobile Home in East 
Bremerton.

But now, faced with the news that Gaeta murdered the girl, he is leaning on his religion to cope.

'How can I be in (God's) grace if I don't forgive?' he asked.

His wife Denise Wright said she's aware of death threats being made toward the suspect's family.

'I just want everybody to stop,' she said. 'It's not their fault this happened. Just blame him, not his family.'

Jenise's body was found on August 7 after an intensive search involving hundreds of law enforcement officers and others.

An
 FBI team with search dogs discovered the girl's body covered by a wood 
pallet and submerged in a muddy bog in woods near her Bremerton home.

Forgiven: Gabriel Gaeta, who'd previously been invited into the family's home, allegedly killed Jenise

Loss: Jenise was last seen on August 2 and her body was found in a muddy boy by the FBI on August 7

She suffered blunt-force trauma to the head and was strangled and sexually assaulted, and that her body appeared to have been moved between a half-hour and three hours after she died.

Authorities said they linked evidence found near the girl's body to the DNA of Gaeta, a high school wrestler with no criminal history. A search of his home found evidence, including a blood- and mud-covered shirt and a bloody towel in Gaeta's bedroom.

James and Denise Wright reported 
Jenise missing on August 3. As authorities began investigating her 
disappearance, three children - aged eight, 12 and 16 - were removed 
from their care.

After she 
went missing, it emerged that James wright was arrested in 2000 on 
felony charges of child molestation in the first degree after an 
8-year-old girl said he inappropriately touched them after a night of 
drinking.

More than a 
year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include 
third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was 
babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched
 her breasts and put his hands down her pants.

In court: Gaeta, right, stands next to his lawyer at a hearing in Kitsap County Superior Court on Monday. Prosecutors are awaiting a competency review before charging him

The felony charges against Wright were eventually dropped, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of assault relating to the older child, court records show.

A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees.

The couple are now focusing on regaining custody of their children, whom state placed with two adult siblings in Bellingham.

They appeared at a hearing to regain custody on Monday and have another next week. In the meantime, they have been allowed visitation.

Mr Wright said he cannot start healing until the children are home.

'How can you put a puzzle back together if you don't have all the pieces?' he asked.
