Lynne Turner, 50, was jailed for nine months for stealing £28,000 to pay back loans from Wonga.com

A parish council clerk was in jail today after she got into deep debt and took out high interest cash loans with controversial Wonga.com.

Mother-of-two Lynne Turner was in charge of the village’s finances so decided to help herself to the funds, moving £1,000 at a time into her own bank, a judge heard.

As clerk to Hughenden Parish Council in Buckinghamshire, she had access to all the money in their bank and 'borrowed' at least £28,000 of taxpayer’s money to try to cope with her huge loan repayments.

A judge told her on Friday that she had betrayed the trust placed in her by the council and the villagers and had to be sent to prison immediately.

Judge Ian Pringle heard that Turner had amassed £90,000 worth of loan arrears, on top of her £380,000 mortgage.

She had fallen into debt after building an extension on her home and had taken out numerous loans and credit cards, the hearing at Oxford Crown Court was told.

The 50-year-old stole a total of £28,200 between August 2010 and May 2011 from the council where she had worked for 16 years.

Turner was convicted by a jury on 10 counts of fraud. The jury took less than an hour to reach unanimous verdicts after a three-day trial last month.

Prosecutor Jermone Silva told a hearing: 'The fraud comprised of some 31 transactions and involved two accounts, which belonged to the defendant and the account held by the Parish.

'Initially the transfers were of £300 pounds for the first two or three months.

'Those transactions then became transactions of £1,000 and they amounted to - in just under a year - a total of £28,200.'

The fraud was uncovered when Turner resigned in June 2011 and her replacement, Charlotte Watts, noticed that six separate sums of £1,000 had been marked with 'correction.'

There was also £21,900 pounds that had been labelled 'cash in transit' on the council’s accounting system, a hearing has been told.

'She (Ms Watts) initially spoke to the defendant. She didn’t receive satisfactory answers and dug a bit deeper and contacted the bank in question,' said Mr Silva.

'She found that money had been transferred in this way by this defendant via internet banking into her (Turner’s) account.

'On closer inspection it also appears that this defendant had actively been working out her accounts because some of her workings, I understand, were on numbers on some of the documents, that were Tipexed out.'

Turner, of High Wycombe, Bucks, transferred the first sum of £300 from the council’s account on August 28, 2010 after she had received £400 from high interest, short-term loan company Wonga.com.

Dejan Mladenovic, defending, said: 'This defendant is 50 years of age and was of previous good character.

'That is something that weighs heavily in her favour.'

The barrister said a psychological report carried out by doctors showed his client had difficulty in coming to terms with her wrongdoing.

He said: 'Mrs Turner has suffered from an adjustment disorder where she does seem to behave in a way, which is inextricably linked with her ability to acknowledge any wrong acts which she may have committed.

He added: 'Mrs Turner does intend and does want to repay all the money that she took and defrauded the Parish Council.

'She will be in a position to start paying that back in six or seven months.

Addressing the defendant, Judge Ian Pringle said: 'You are 50 years of age and have no previous convictions of any sort.

'Until 2010 Mrs Turner, it seems you worked hard all your life and brought up your family in what I’m sure was a commendable way.

'As a clerk of the Parish Council, you, in effect, were in charge of their finances.

'Many of the Parish councillors in the time you served there got to know you well and you were completely trusted by them.

'The plain fact of the matter is, Mrs Turner, that you abused that trust - the trust placed on you by the Parish Council and by all the residents of that Parish.'
