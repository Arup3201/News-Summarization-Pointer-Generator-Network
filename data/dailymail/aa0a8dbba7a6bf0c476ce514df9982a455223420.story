It is known as one of the most intrepid polar expeditions in history, and cost five men their lives.

But over 100 years on from Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated trek to the South Pole and back, two men have become the first people in history to complete the iconic 1,800-mile route.

At 1.15am GMT Ben Saunders, 36 from Britain and former WASPS rugby player Tarka L’Herpiniere, 32, from France, completed the epic Terra Nova trek.

The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole.

Scott and four companions reached the pole on 17 January 1912, where they found that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days.

Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole. Some of their bodies, journals and photographs were discovered by a search party eight months later.

For many years after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few questions were asked about the causes of the disaster which overcame his polar party. 

The degree of Scott's personal culpability remains a matter of controversy among commentator, but it is thought that exhaustion, extreme cold and starvation definitely led to the men's demise.

They walked for 1,795 miles across the inhospitable landscape of Antarctica to set the world record for the longest polar journey on foot in history.

It has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength, as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46C wind chill.

The entire trek was equivalent to 69 back-to-back marathons.

Mr Saunders said, ‘It is almost impossible to comprehend what we have achieved.

'Completing Scott’s Terra Nova expedition has been a life-long dream and I’m overcome to be standing here at the finish.

Captain Robert Falcon Scott, 1868 to 1912. British Royal Navy officer and Antarctic explorer.

‘The journey has been a mammoth undertaking that has tested the bounds of our bodies and minds each and every day.’

‘At times we found ourselves in dire straits in the intense cold, wind and altitude of the high plateau, weakened by half-rations and closer to the brink of survival than I had ever anticipated this journey taking us.

‘In that light, both Tarka and I feel a 
combination of awe and profound respect for the endurance, tenacity and 
fortitude of Captain Scott and his team, a century ago.’

Captain Scott and his men died having covered almost 1,600 miles of the route in their bid to become the first men to reach the South Pole.

They were pipped to the accolade on 17 January 1912 by a team of Norwegian explorers led by Roald Amundsen and on their return journey died of a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold.

While Captain Scott’s men had rudimentary equipment by today’s standards, the two modern explorers were kitted out with gear from Intel, which managed to provide a Wi-Fi connection so that the explorers could blog about their adventure from arguably the most inhospitable place on the planet.

The incredible journey: The Scott Expedition was a 1,800-mile (2,900km), four-month return journey from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back on foot following Scott¿s route.

It has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength, as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46C wind chill.

The explorers were kitted out with a Sony VAIO Pro Ultrabook each built to survive in temperatures up to -40C.

The computers sported a 4th generation Intel Core processor and provided Wi-Fi in one of the earth's most inhospitable places.

Each computer weighed 870g and were prepared to have the minimum amount of programmes on them, which led the duo to create their own games on the laptops.

They connected to the internet using an Iriduim satellite phone.

The kit was charged using solar panels attached to the specially designed sleds.

Intel tested the technology by freezing it in labs for months at a time to make sure it would work in the extremely cold temperatures.

Retracing Scott’s original 1911-12 route, Ben Saunders and Tarka started at Scott’s Hut on the north shore of Cape Evans on Ross Island.

They traversed the Ross Ice Shelf, before climbing nearly 8000ft on one of the world’s largest glaciers, the Beardmore Glacier, on to the Antarctic Plateau; and onwards to the South Pole.

From the Pole it was back the way they came, finishing 900 miles (1,450km) later back where they began at the coast.
