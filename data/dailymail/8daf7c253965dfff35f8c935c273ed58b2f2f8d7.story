Twin daughters of a British woman who were kidnapped in Kenya two weeks ago have been reunited with their parents after being rescued by police.

The 14-year-olds were seized on the way to their £16,000-a-year school in Nairobi by abductors disguised as police officers.

They were taken to a house on the western edge of the capital, where police later found children's drawings that read 'home please' and 'I wanna go home'.

The
kidnappers made a number of ransom demands that started at $1million 
(£630,000), but dropped to around $200,000 (£125,000) after 
negotiations, friends of the family said.

Four
of the suspects were arrested when they were lured to a meeting in the 
city centre on the pretence that that would be paid the ransom.

On
Monday, they led officers from the Kenyan Flying Squad and the Special 
Crimes Prevention Unit to the safe house in Ngong, where the girls were 
found in good health.

Their 
parents, Tinu Mahajan and his wife Kiran, who own a chain of 11 hotels 
across eastern Africa, told of their relief that their daughters were 
safe.

Mr Mahajan told The Times: 'If you are a parent, you will understand how it feels to have your children returned. We are just spending a lot of time together.'

He said the police 'did an excellent job'.

The couple had enlisted the help 
former British soldiers from a Nairobi-based security firm, but a 
spokesman for the British High Commission said 'the UK was not involved'
in the case.

The alleged 
abductors included one disgraced former police officer, Joash Opiyo 
Jagero, who was fired three years ago for his link to a £590,000 bank 
raid, police said.

The 
girls, who have not been named, were snatched near the private Peponi 
School in the same suburb where Al Shabaab militants killed at least 67 
people after storming the Westgate shopping mall on September 21.

Police
said there was no direct link between the two incident, although the 
kidnappers may have decided to act because the security services were 
distracted by the terror attack.
