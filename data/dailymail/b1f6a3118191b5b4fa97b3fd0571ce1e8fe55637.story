A Florida congressman today pleaded guilty to cocaine possession after allegedly buying the drug from an undercover agent in Washington D.C. in a sting operation last month.

Congressman Henry 'Trey' Radel, 37, was sentenced to one year of supervised probation and fined $260, which will be paid to a victims' compensation fund.

'Your honor, I apologize for what I've done,' Radel told the judge as he appeared in District of Columbia Superior Court. 'I hit a bottom and I realize I need help.'

After the cocaine allegations emerged on Tuesday, Radel admitted in a statement that he is also battling alcoholism that 'led to an extremely irresponsible choice'.

In court: Rep. Henry 'Trey' Radel, is pictured leaving court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor drug possession charge. He has been sentenced to a year of supervised probation and a $250 fine

The judge sentenced him to the 
probation while he undergoes treatment in Florida, but if he violates 
the probation he will have to serve 180 days in jail. If he completes 
it, he won't have a conviction on his record.

'I am so sorry to be here,' he added. 'I want to come 
out of this stronger and I intend to do that, to be a better man, a 
better husband and continuing serving this country.'

He
 was targeted in the sting operation on October 29 after a suspected 
drug dealer who had been arrested in a separate drugs investigation told
 agents that the politician was one of his customers.

Drug Enforcement Administration and 
FBI agents then set up the undercover drug sting, and Radel and a friend allegedly 
met an undercover agent outside a restaurant at Dupont 
Circle.

According to an account provided by authorities to the Washington Post, Radel asked the friend and the agent to go with him to his home but the undercover agent declined.

Radel bought 3.5 grams of cocaine, worth around $250, from the agent in his car, the account said.

Afterwards officers stormed the vehicle and Radel invited the officers back to his apartment to discuss the incident. When they arrived they allegedly found a vial containing cocaine, the Post said.

operation on October 29

Remorse: Radel (pictured with his son) said he was addicted to alcohol and would be seeking treatment

Agents did not cuff him but he was informed him that he would be facing criminal charges related to the purchase.

The charging document states that Radel 'did unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally possess a quantity of cocaine'.

House Speaker John Boehner has not asked Radel to resign and said the issue is a matter for the courts.

'Members
 of Congress should be held to the highest standards, and the alleged 
crime will be handled by the courts,' Boehner said through a spokesman. 
'Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family and his 
constituents.'

Radel, a former talk show host and reporter who represents a Florida district including Fort Myers, Naples, and Cape Coral, has not participated in any House votes this week.

He is married to Fox4 anchor Amy Wegmann Radel and they have one son, Henry Jude Radel IV, who was born in 2011.

He identifies himself on his Twitter 
profile as a 'Hip Hop conservative' and 'lover of #liberty,' and his 
Twitter account has remained active in the past few weeks, including on 
the day of the bust.

The
 GOP favorite posted to Facebook on Tuesday evening: 'I'm profoundly 
sorry to let down my family, particularly my wife and son, and the 
people of Southwest Florida.

'I
 struggle with the disease of alcoholism, and this led to an extremely 
irresponsible choice. As the father of a young son and a husband to a 
loving wife, I need to get help so I can be a better man for both of 
them.

'In facing this 
charge, I realize the disappointment my family, friends and constituents
 must feel. Believe me, I am disappointed in myself, and I stand ready 
to face the consequences of my actions.

'However,
 this unfortunate event does have a positive side. It offers me an 
opportunity to seek treatment and counseling.'

Two days after the incident, Radel shared a photograph online showing him with his family as he wore a Buzz Lightyear costume for Halloween.

In
 an interview earlier this year with Roll Call, Radel said his favorite vacation spot was
Cartegena, Colombia -  an expensive coastal city in a country notorious 
for cocaine trafficking, ABC reported.

He appears to be the first sitting 
member of Congress charged with a drug offense since former Rep. 
Frederick Richmond of New York was convicted in 1982 on charges of tax 
evasion and drug possession.

Florida Republican Party Chairman Lenny Curry said he was disappointed in Radel but glad that he was seeking help.
