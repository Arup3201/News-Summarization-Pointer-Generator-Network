A man has been caught on camera kicking a tiny squirrel off the edge of the Grand Canyon.

The cruel clip sees two men, believed to be French, in boxer shorts and straw hats on the canyon, one appearing to be laying out treats for a squirrel running around his feet.

The man lays out a trail towards the canyon, goes to put on his shoe, and as the fluffy rodent gets close to the edge to get its paws on the treats, he kicks it off the cliff.

The 15-second video was uploaded to YouTube by a user claiming he was only just a witness and had no part in the evil joke.

‘I did not realize what was happening until it was too late,’ Jonthan Hildebrand wrote in his defence. ‘I do not know who they are. All I know is that they were French.’

Evil: The short video shows two men in boxer shorts on the Grand Canyon, one of them laying out treats for a squirrel  (seen in the left corner)

Danger ahead: The man walks off as the little squirrel dashes towards the treacherous trail of treats

At least one of them deserves a kicking: After luring the adorable rodent to the edge he takes aim

Innocent: The poor squirrel has no idea what is coming...

Gone: The tiny animal flies off the edge of the canyon after the, allegedly French, man kicks it into the abyss
