Intimate: The prints of Marylin Monroe were taken by her close friend and business partner, celebrity photographer Milton H Greene

The pictures of Monroe were taken from 1953 to 1957 when the moviestar had a close friend- and partnership with Mr Greene.

The pair ran a production company together during which time Monroe modelled for him in 52 sessions, creating some of the most memorable snaps of her.

Milton Greene was a prominent fashion photographer of the time and shot many other celebrities, photos of which were on sale last night.

His Monroe prints are highly valued by collectors and include series of refined 
black-and-white studio photos and shots taken in natural surroundings, 
sometime in provocative poses.

Some of the 238 pictures from Milton Greene's portfolio up for sale last night have never been 
published before and Desa
Unicum house in Warsaw was filled to the brim.

Juliusz Windorbski, head of the auction house in the Polish capital, said it was the largest ever sale of Greene's photos.

'Until now, Greene's photos were sold one by one or in lots of no more than a few, but never so many at once,' Windorbski said.

The photos come from a collection of 
some 4,000 Greene pictures that Poland obtained from Chicago businessman
Dino Matingas in the mid-1990s as the result of a complex communist-era
embezzlement scandal linked to the buy-out of Poland's state debt.

black-and-white photo of a reclining Monroe in black stockings sold for $16,000 (50,000 zlotys), and another of her in a ballerina's dress sold 
for almost $20,000.

A picture of her in bed sold for $8,500.

The 2.4 million zlotys ($735,000) obtained made it the nation's biggest photo auction to date as only one 
remained unsold.

The auction also offered Greene's pictures of other stars, like Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marlene Dietrich and Liza Minnelli.

Success: The collection had been estimated to fetch $680,000 but sold for over $735,000

Other greats in the vast portrait 
collection, which had been estimated at $680,000, included Cary Grant, 
Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman, Alfred Hitchcock and Marlon Brando.

Marylin
Monroe, real name Norma Jean Baker, began her career as a model in the 
early 40s and had her breakthrough on the silver screen in 1950s movies 
All About Eve and The Asphalt Jungle.

Her blonde curls and dangerous curves earned her sex symbol status which has lasted for decades.

She died on August 5, 1962, aged 36, from a barbiturate overdose at her Los Angeles home.
