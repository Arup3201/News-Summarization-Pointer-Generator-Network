While people of his age across Britain struggle to get onto the property ladder, this 23-year-old farm hand chose to build his own house - for just £3,000.

Dayne Bendle, of Winkleigh, Devon, who earns just £10,000 a year in agriculture, spent a year building it without any prior knowledge of construction.

The house ‘in a field in the middle of nowhere’, which began as an abandoned tractor trailer, comes with a kitchen, living room and upstairs bedroom.

Mr Bendle said: ‘On the money I'm earning, it would take me ages to pay back any kind of loan and I didn't want to be in debt for the next 30 years.

‘I only earn around £10,000 a year as a farm hand, so saving a deposit would have been impossible.

'So I had this idea. I had no experience of building houses before but I thought I'd give it a go.

‘I had some tips from my dad, who is a carpenter, and a helping hand from some of my friends. It was a year of hard work but it's finally paid off.’

All the materials were either donated by friends or bought at bargain trade prices from scrap merchants.

The double-glazing was picked up for just £25 while the cooker was completely free.

Settled in now: Mr Bendle raised concern among some of his relatives when he first spoke of his intentions to build the cabin in a country field

Mr Bendle added: ‘I love the peace and quiet of living in a field in the middle of nowhere. After living in a town it's a peaceful change.

‘I lived with my parents [15 miles away] in South Molton before, so I'm enjoying the independence.

'In the winter it's a bit cold - but that's the only downside to living in the cabin.’

Mr Bendle surprised friends and friends when he first spoke of his intentions to build the cabin, but said he has quickly settled since moving in last July.

He added: ‘To start off with my parents were a bit worried about me living in a cabin I had built myself.

'But now they have seen it and been here a few times they are happy. A lot of my friends do still live at home.

Come back to my place? Single Mr Bendle is yet to find a woman to share his cabin, but says he would be happy showing off his hand-built home to any prospective dates

Simple: The upkeep is very cheap for Mr Bendle, who has a woodborer to keep himself warm and relies on gas canisters when it comes to cooking

Outdoors: He grows his own fruit and vegetables on the land he has been given by a farmer friend, and he plans to keep chickens in the future

'They think I'm a bit crazy living with no electricity or home comforts. I don't really miss home comforts myself.

‘I always find something to do and don't sit on my bottom very often. I've made a lot of new friends around the area.’

Single Mr Bendle is yet to find a woman to share his cabin, but says he would be happy showing off his hand-built home to any prospective dates.

He said: ‘I don't have a girlfriend but I would be comfortable bringing a girl back - it would be a chance to show it off.

'But I don't think a lot of girls would be interested in living the way I do.

‘Maybe in the future I might build a bigger one but I can't ever see myself buying a house.’

If Mr Bendle was looking at buying a property in Winkleigh, the cheapest one currently on the market in the village is a £130,000 two-bedroom cottage.
