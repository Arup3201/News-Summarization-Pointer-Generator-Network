Temperatures are expected to drop up to 30 degrees below normal across the Midwest today as the Polar Vortex returns for a third round of severe arctic weather.

By the middle of the week the arctic blast will head east plunging temperatures in Indiana and Massachusetts into single digits.

Even the Deep South will experience temperatures below freezing, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

The NWS said it will not be as severe as the first Polar Vortex to hit the U.S. in January but described it as 'a cold mass of arctic air.'

Cities including New York to Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit and Washington, D.C. had all been enjoying temperatures in the 50s last weekend.

The Midwest and North East were
 thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the 
past week, but forecasters have warned it won't be for long as another 
cold front is on its way.

The eastern two-thirds of the U.S is 
expected to see below-average temperatures this week after January 
averages were found to have been well below normal according to a to a 
monthly climate report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.

The cold spell comes from the northern 
polar vortex, a high-altitude flow of air that circles west to east 
above the North Pole. 

A cold mass of arctic air will bring temperatures that are 10 to 30 degrees below across the Midwest

As global temperatures have risen, the 
difference in temperature between the Arctic and lower latitudes has 
shrunk, causing the vortex to become 'wavier,' John Holdren, director of
 the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a 
YouTube video following similarly cold temperatures last month.

A forecast from NOAA also reveals a swathe of cold temperatures starting in the Midwest on Tuesday and stretching south and to the coast.

The mercury is expected to plummet well below average, while a higher than average amount of rain is also due.

Frosty forecast: The coldest air will settle in late in the week as the polar vortex is forecast to take another southward dip

Snow joke: The first potential snow event appears to be a minor one with a general coating to an inch or two within its reach. Some locations may get just flurries

'Temperatures 20°F below normal will likely invade the Upper 
Midwest on Sunday, and gradually spread southeastwards during the week,' Dr Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground said.

'The peak cold is predicted to occur late next week, with temperatures 20
 - 35° below normal covering much of the eastern 2/3 of the country.'

Ten-day forecasts by Weather.com show that temperatures will stay below freezing, with Embarrass, Minnesota enduring lows of -29F next Friday.

And it won't be over quickly as forecaster predict that the best chance of snow is believed to be between February 26 and March 3, as temperatures on the East Coast remain at least 15 degrees below normal, Philly.com reported.

It will come as yet more grief for the Midwest, southern and eastern areas of the country, which has been battered with grueling weather while the West largely suffers from droughts.

The relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic-related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years.

U.S. airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since December 1, including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987-1988, when records began.
