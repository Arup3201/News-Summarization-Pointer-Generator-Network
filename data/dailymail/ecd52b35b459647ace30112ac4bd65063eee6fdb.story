Pope Francis today continued his diplomatic initiative to revitalise the stalled Middle East peace process with a hugely symbolic gesture beside one of Judaism's holiest sites.

Standing in front of the Western Wall, the Pontiff hugged his two friends, Argentine Rabbi Abraham Skorka and leader of the South American country's Muslim Community, Omar Abboud. Both men were part of the inter-faith delegation.

The three-day visit has been deemed a diplomatic success, despite some early controversy, after Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres agreed to travel to the Vatican next month for talks.

Among the names listed were 85 people killed in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish associaiton in Buenos Aires. Francis was an auxiliary bishop of the city at the time of the attack.

In particular Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed the issue of the controversial security barrier erected by Israeli forces. Earlier in his trip, Pope Francis had prayed beside a section of the wall in Manger Square, Bethlehem.  

Commenting after the talks, Prime Minister Netanyahu said: 'I
 explained to the pope that constructing the fence (separation barrier) 
prevented many more victims of Palestinian terror, which continues 
today.'

In a later meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres, Pope Francis planted an olive tree - which is regarded as a sign of peace - in the garden of his official residence.

Pope Francis said: 'You
 are known as a man of peace and a maker of peace, and I express my 
admiration and thankfulness for your attitude.'

In response, President Peres replied: 'We would be honored to offer such a prayer either in our home or yours, in accordance with your kind offer.'

President Peres said the Papal visit would revitalise the stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians 'based on two states living in 
peace, a Jewish state, Israel, and an Arab state, Palestine.'

'With shame for the fact that man made himself the owner of evil; with shame that man made himself into God and sacrificed his brothers. Never again!! Never again!! Francis. 5.26.2014.'

One of the survivors, Joeseph Gottdenker, 72, from Canada told the Pope of his experience: 'The Catholic people who saved me and risked the lives of their whole families to save me, they are looking down today and proud to see me meet the leader of their faith.'
