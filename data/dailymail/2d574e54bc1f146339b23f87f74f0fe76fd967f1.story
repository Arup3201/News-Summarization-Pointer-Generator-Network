Taxpayers are being charged $33 million to save 800 birds who are living on an old section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge which is no longer in use. 

The double-crested cormorants, which are protected but not endangered, have lived on a decrepit section of the bridge for decades.

Despite the eastern section of the bridge being replaced with a new $6.4m span, the birds have refused to relocate, meaning officials have been unable to dismantle the old section which was damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake.  

Taxpayers are footing a $33 million bill to help relocate 800 double-crested comorants who have lived under a now replaced section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge for decades

Officials have unsuccessfully used pricey decoys, bird recordings and have placed specially-made nests planted on the new bridge, to lure the birds some 100 feet. Critics say relocating the birds could end up costing them $33m. 

Given only 800 birds live on the bridge, the cost of moving each one is about $40,000.

Radio show host Brian Sussman said that figure was 'more than most people in the United States make in a given year'. 

Fox News reports that relocation are set to soar further, because once the birds start laying eggs in February, the demolition process must stop completely. 

Taxpayers are spending another $12m to fast-track the process and a further million for netting to prevent more birds from settling in. And that's not the end of it. Transport officials say they'll probably need more time and money to complete the job. 

The eastern section of the bridge, damaged 25 years ago during the Loma Prieta earthquake, was replaced at a cost of $6.4 million, and officials now want to dismantle it 

Oficials say they are bound by the law, and if they don't follow it, taxpayers could face an even bigger bill

Nearly a quarter of a million cars use the bridge each date. It has two sections. The western section, which is a suspension bridge and links San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the eastern section, which connects the island with Oakland.  

Callers to Mr Sussman's radio show offered less costly and speedier solutions to the bird problems, from blasting them with fire hoses, to hiring rocker and hunter Ted Nugent to shoot them with his bow and arrow. 

Mr Sussman blamed bird protection laws written in 1918 for the problem, but said changing the laws in the Bay Are would be hopeless.

He said: 'You would have to go through hell and high water because there are so many avowed environmentalists that want that set in stone because, I believe, they see us as the invasive species.'

California Department of Transportation spokesperson Leah Robinson Leach said the agency was required to follow the law and if they didn't do so, the penalties they could face 'could far exceed' the bird relocation costs.

The demolition of the original section of the bridge is not expected to be completed until 2018.
