A 29-year-old aspiring model and actor who is also believed to be a martial arts expert with a black belt in karate has been charged with the killing of 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott.

Although her body has not yet been found, police announced that Marriott is believed to be dead, Assistant Attorney General 
James Vara said on Saturday.

And today, Seth Mazzaglia, 29, of Dover, was charged with the second-degree murder of the missing student as her distraught family were tragically told to call off their frantic search.

'Lizzi' Marriott vanished on her way to visit a friend on Tuesday - 
police now believe she is dead

Last night hundreds of friends and family members attended an emotional candlelit vigil for Lizzi at the Bay State Commons.

Her devastated father Robert Marriott and best friend Meghan Hoyt were among those pictured at the solemn evening held in tribute to the young student.

Aspiring actor and model Seth Mazzaglia is scheduled to appear on Monday morning at Dover District Court on a second degree murder charge.

During a press conference today to 
announce Mazzaglia's arrest, Assistant Attorney General James Vara said 
that the Dover Police Department have gathered enough credible 
information to believe that Marriott is dead - although they have not 
located her body.

Together
with Porstmouth and state police, authorities in Denver have been 
searching the area around Prescott Park and Pierce Island since around 
7.30 p.m last night.

'We are continuing to search for her body in the area by Pierce Island,' Vara said toÂ Foster's Daily Democrat

'We have information we are investigating at this point.'

The assistant attorney general also announced that Marriott's car, a 2001 tan coloured Mazda tribute had been located and in addition Vera confirmed that there were no threats in existence to other students at the University of New Hampshire.

'I want to confirm there are no threats to the other students at UNH,' he said. 'This is unrelated other than the fact she's a student at the university.'

Claiming that the ongoing 
investigation precluded him from discussing details, Vera admitted that 
Marriott and Mazzaglia knew each other.

'This is still an active and ongoing investigation,' said Vara.

'We will continue with any and all resources available to us.'

The announcement of the arrest and declaration that Marriott was in all probability dead came at 1 p.m., and family members were informed that they should 'stand down' their search for their loved one.

Marriott's aunt, Rebecca Tyning, confirmed that authorities told them to stop their search before the afternoon announcement.

In a phone interview with Foster's Daily Democrat, Tyning called the announcement of her niece's death 'surreal.'

Marriott was a marine biology major who lived with her aunt in Chester. She was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts.

She had attended a class at the university on Tuesday night and made plans to visit a friend in Dover. Police tracked down the friends, who said Lizzi never arrived that evening.

Authorities have also analysed her cell phone records - and those of her friends - and discovered she texted a friend at 10.11pm on Tuesday, saying she was on her way to Dover.

But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since.

The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill St. in Dover.

His website indicates that he is an 'experienced actor, writer and fight choreographer' who stands 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds.

He claims that his 'special skills and talents' include a third degree black belt in Okinawan karate and that he is proficient with a samurai sword, butterfly swords and other hand held weapons.

Robert Modee, who is a Kittery, Maine, martial arts instructor, confirmed that Mazzaglia is an expert in karate and that he trained with the suspect for almost 20-years.

'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said.

Indeed, just before his arrest, Mazzaglia had been giving martial arts lessons to children at the Kittery Community Center said Modee.

'I don't understand what's going on right now,' Modee said. 'I'm completely floored with all this. I don't even know what to think.'

As well as his expertise in hand to hand combat, Mazzaglia claimed to have performed in 17 theater productions between 2000 and 2010.

In 2005, Mazzaglia played the role of Richie Valens in a July performance of 'The Buddy Holly Story,' at Seacoast Repertory Theatre.

One former cast member, Brett Wulfson said she remembered Mazzaglia as a pleasant man, 'very involved with self-defence.'

In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007.

Marriott was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in Chester and commuted to the Durham campus. A message seeking comment was left with her parents, Robert and Melissa Marriott of Westborough, Mass.

Before today's tragic news Lizzi's grandmother, Susan Marriott, had been desperately tending the phone's at the Chester home where her granddaughter lived 
while other family members were out handing out fliers and searching for
her.

'She
is a good student and she's hard-working,' her grandmother said. 'She 
is a person that doesn't have a multitude of friends but she has good 
friends, a small group of good friends.'
