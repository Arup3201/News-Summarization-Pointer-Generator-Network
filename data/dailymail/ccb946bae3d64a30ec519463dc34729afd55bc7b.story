A row has erupted after a swingers club opened directly opposite a Christian TV station and just yards away from a primary school.

Vivente Club in Sunderland promises late-night sex swapping parties five nights a week and organisers offer to open 'by appointment only' between 10am-4pm.

But the venue has been condemned by a local councillor, who says it is a 'blatant attempt to cash in on people's sexual interests'.

Controversial: The club, which is offering 'late night sex-swapping parties' opened opposite the God V headquarters (on the left) in Sunderland

The swinging club will cost couples £25 for a 
12-month membership, allowing them access to six 'playrooms', three 
lounge floors and a couples-only area. It also has an 11-room bed and 
breakfast.

It is located yards from Hudson Road Primary School and directly opposite Christian media outlet - God TV.

Sunderland Councillor Barbara McClennan, said: 'The particularly sordid nature of this club makes me - backed by local residents - even more determined to block this blatant attempt to cash in on people’s sexual interests.

'If someone wants to live a "swinging lifestyle" let them do it in their own homes - not on the doorsteps of Hendon residents, around the corner from a local school and near places of worship.'

Swinging, where couples swap sexual partners, is not illegal, but Sunderland City Council said the club needs planning permission to operate - which Vivente’s owners do not have.

Sunderland City Council confirmed the authority had not given the club the go-ahead.

A spokesperson from Sunderland City Council said: 'The use of the premises as a swingers’ club is unauthorised and needs planning permission.

'All planning applications are considered on their individual merits and have

to undergo a statutory period of public consultation.

'This gives local residents, 
businesses and community partners the opportunity to make their views 
known on proposed developments within their area.'

Vivente’s
 organisers, who claim to have 20 years’ experience of the swinging 
scene, boast on their website: 'We want to break the stereotypical 
ideals people have about swinging and hopefully bring something fresh 
and vibrant to our venue.'

Anger: It was opened just yards away from Hudson Road Primary School

Vivente said: 'We are a private members club who offer a safe discreet environment for professional people to meet like minded people. We do not promise sex swap parties, that has been hyped up.

'What about transvestites and cross dressers, do they not have a human right to frequent establishments like this where they are free to express themselves.

Clients such as these and single girls who have enquired do not feel safe in town centres.

'The issue of binge drinkers and louts in the city centre at weekends should be far more of a concern.

'As for the God Channel, Barbara McClennan is using this as a pitiful excuse. The bible states no man should lie with another man yet churches allow gay marriage.

'Also if Ms McClennan is so concerned for her patch why are our neighbours the lifeline centre, where heroin addicts are given methodone and numerous amount of used needles are found right near the school in back lanes etc.

'Camrex house and the Norfolk Hotel are dens for drug addicts and alcoholics who are frequently seen drunk at 8am in the morning. There is nothing of danger or offensive about professional couples entering a building and the door closed behind them.

'Also she mentions about keeping it in their home, how is that possible? people have families and neighbours to think about.

'Swinging couples are spicing up a relationship and that is far better than affairs and divorce affecting the family unit and devastating children. This lifestyle keeps families together.

'It is 2014 and we will fight and defend our corner as far as we can.'
