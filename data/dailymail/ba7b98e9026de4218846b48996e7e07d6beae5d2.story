Sergio Aguero's father has revealed that the Manchester City striker 'would love to go to Barcelona' amid Spanish media reports that the Catalans have launched a £31million bid.

Barcelona hope to tie up a deal for the 47-cap Argentina international and know that their opening offer is likely to be rebuffed outright by City.

But new Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique is a keen admirer of Aguero and he will insist that the Catalans return with a higher bid if a deal could potentially be struck, according to Spanish website Sport.

Keen: New Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique is an admirer of Aguero and is driving the Catalans' bid

Aguero, 25, has a great relationship with Barcelona star Lionel Messi and Enrique is hopeful they can soon be club team-mates as well as fellow Argentine internationals.

With Aguero under contract at City until 2017, the club would be unlikely to even consider selling their prize asset for anything less than the £36m they paid for him in July 2011.

Aguero enjoyed a fine season at the Etihad despite injury, scoring an impressive 28 goals in 34 appearances as he helped City win the Premier League and the Capital One Cup double.

And his father Leonel del Castillo does not believe that Manuel Pellegrini will allow his star striker to leave for the club he has always wanted to represent, such is his importance to the side.

He told Spanish newspaper AS: 'He would love to go to Barcelona but Manchester City will make it impossible (for Aguero to go).'
