A store clerk manged to foil an armed robber with just the swat of his hand.

The workers, who was behind the counter at the OK Food Store in Houston, Texas early Thursday morning, got the shock of his life when a young man pulled a gun on him and demanded money as he opened the register.

Rather than hand over the bills however, the clerk, who is not being identified,  started hitting at the man's gun repeatedly, sending him and his accomplice running from the store.

The gunman first enters pretending to be a customer, pointing out things to the clerk as he takes out a large wad of cash.

Then, a minute later, his friend leaves the car and joins him in the store.

When the clerk then opens up the cash register to make the sale, the gun comes out.

Rather than hand over the money the sore clerk began swatting at the gun

The clerk swatted at the gun repeatedly, and no shots were fired

The men then flee to their car and leave

The clerk then begins hitting the gun and throwing what appears to be coins at the men.

The two soon flee, without ever firing, and, with a third man, jump in the car and speed off, this as the clerk chases them with what may be a gun.

Police are still searching for the men.
