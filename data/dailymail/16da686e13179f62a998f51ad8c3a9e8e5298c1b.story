One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan has had a £20,000 bounty placed on his remaining good eye by a criminal underworld boss who wants him attacked in prison.

Police believe the violent underworld feud behind Cregan’s killing spree is far from over now he has been jailed for murdering Mark and David Short, as well as  PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32.

As the jury was considering its verdicts, Mark and David Short’s grave at Droylsden Cemetery was vandalised in a hammer attack.

Pictures of the Shorts and flowers left by loved ones were scattered all over the plot.

Victims: Dale Cregan murdered Mark Short (far right) at a birthday party in May and then killed his father David Short (next to his son) three months later - and a gang is said to want Cregan's other eye removed

It is understood the imprisoned head of a London crime family has now put out a £20,000 ‘contract’ on Cregan.

The rival gang leader is said to be sympathetic to the Shorts, and has made the contract payable on the destruction of Cregan’s good right eye in prison.

Cregan is starting his whole life sentence segregated from other prisoners because of the continuing threat to his safety.

In his criminal life Cregan’s false black onyx eye became a badge of pride and a mark of his hardman image on the streets of East Manchester.

He knew the false eye and the empty socket behind it – which had to be searched every time he came into court – looked menacing.

Criminal associates say he would use it to intimidate other drug dealers.

But mystery surrounds how he lost his left eye.

Some say it was badly damaged by a knuckleduster in a drunken bar-room brawl while others say it was knocked out in a fight with gangsters in Bangkok.

But a police source said officers were suspicious of the stories because there is no marking or scar tissue around his eye socket.

They suspect his eye may have been ‘plucked out’ by a knife-wielding crime rival.

The source added: ‘He thought it made him look like a baddie out of a James Bond film. He was definitely looking for a dramatic image and this fulfilled it.’

First crime scene: The first victim, Mark Short, was killed at the Cotton Tree Inn pub in Droylsden at just before midnight

where Cregan's grenades pitted them with shrapnel and smashed nearby 
window throwing glass everywhere 

Cregan was subjected to twice-daily checks behind his false eye as part of the security operation surrounding his trial.

During the trial, a source at HMP Manchester, better known as Strangeways, said: ‘Every time he comes in and every time he goes out of the building he must be searched and checked – including behind his eye.

‘Because he is a category A prisoner, each time he leaves these walls he is strip-searched and he must take his eye out so we can look behind it for drugs or some sort of weapon or anything he shouldn’t have.

‘And every time he comes back from court he gets strip-searched again and he has to take his eye out again – and it p****s him off.’

Cold-blooded: Cregan decided in advance he would kill the police, and eventually took lives of PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) after calling 999 claiming there was a burglary where he was hiding

Cregan's use of grenades  during 
his killing spree was ‘incredibly worrying’, said Sir Peter Fahy, Chief 
Constable of Greater Manchester Police.

He said: ‘It was military-style 
weaponry – grenades from a former war zone. The worry is that there are 
huge numbers of these weapons out there from other parts of the world 
and it is relatively easy for certain individuals to import them into 
this country.’

Sources revealed that hand grenades, 
machine guns, bullets and even rockets were among a shocking array of 
firepower available on the black market.

Attack: Cregan emptied the magazine of this Glock handgun and then dumped it by the bodies of the officers he had just fatally injured 

Extraordinary: Greater Manchester Police discovered this stash of  grenades inside a storm drain during Dale Cregan's 17-week trial

The ‘shopping list’ available to 
criminals means they can buy grenades for as little as £150 each, while 
semi-automatic handguns with bullets cost £250. Military-issue assault 
rifles cost £500 to £1,000 while a magazine of bullets for the weapons 
costs anything from £5 to £50.

Grenades are the latest addition to the arsenal of criminals as they ramp up the ‘terror quotient’.

Cregan had an arsenal of M75 hand 
grenades and used four during his murderous spree which claimed the 
lives of four people last year.

Only last week police found a cache of ten grenades believed to be linked to Cregan at an address in Greater Manchester.

Police say the grenades used by 
Cregan came from the former Yugoslavia. The M75 is a fragmentation 
grenade which has 3,000 tiny steel balls packed into its shell which 
explode over a 50m radius.

Police sources say the Yugoslavian grenades are available on Britain’s streets and are becoming a status symbol among criminals.
