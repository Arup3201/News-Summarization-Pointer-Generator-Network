THE parrot...a bird better known for its comical ability to copy someone's voice than its beautiful sound.

Until now. Because these Parrot ZIKs boast some of the best sound quality this side of Ibiza, transforming your ears into a dance floor one minute, or concert auditorium the next.

Indeed, they are sure to appeal to music lovers of all tastes and ages, their understated but substantial design likely to hit the right note across the age spectrum.

Ear we go! These ZIKs boast fantastic sound quality and look stunning, too

Everything about these ZIKs oozes quality. The box itself wouldn't look out of place in the Tate Modern. The headphones, although a bit on the heavy side, are works of art, too.

They fit snugly around your ears, and reduce outside noise to a minimum. The clever thing about the ZIKs is that they are wireless - connecting via Bluetooth.

Plus, with their 'NFC' technology, you can sync and pair portable music players by touch (in much the same way an Oyster card works).

Using a touch-sensitive pad on the left ear, you can turn the volume up and down and even skip songs. In theory this sounds great, but doesn't work quite as well as I hoped...especially on public transport.

I got a few strange looks from fellow commuters who watched me tap manically on my ear to try and turn the volume down.

In the gym, too, the rather fiddly touch-sensitive mechanism often causes you to skip songs accidentally or blast your ears into oblivion when you mistakenly crank up the volume.

Bird of pray: You'll worship the headphones' design

A touch of genius, though, is their ability to pause music when you take them away from your ears, so you can bid farewell to having to stop mid conversation to turn off the tinny background noise emanating from your headphones.

The sound quality is superb. At both low and high volume, depth of sound is fantastic, great for those who are weary of damaging their ears. For those who aren't, no fret. At full blast the ZIKs are a joy, too. Just be careful...

But all these positives come at a price, with these beauties retailing for a hefty £349.

The idea of touch-sensitive earphones is a master stroke, and it's the main reason you'll snap up one of these.

However, the system needs more refining to elevate it from cool gadget to game-changer.

For those after statement style and sound that will blow your mind, though, these ZIKs are worth every penny.
