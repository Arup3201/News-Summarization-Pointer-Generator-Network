Wayne Kinvig repeatedly posed as a charity fundraiser collecting money for his 'sick little brother' to buy cannabis

A teenage career criminal has been jailed today after repeatedly posing as a charity fundraiser collecting sponsorship money to spend on cannabis.

His targets – some as old as 77 – were so moved by his false sob stories, including one about his 'sick little brother' having cerebral palsy, that they donated their pension money to the 19-year-old.

A court heard how Wayne Kinvig got a ‘buzz’ out of preying on people’s kindness on doorsteps in Burnley, Lancashire.

Kinvig would knock on doors armed with an official-looking clipboard and a sponsor sheet attached.

He even carried around charity details and information about Gift Aid.

The teenager would also inflate the amounts donated on his fake sponsor forms from £1 or £2 to £5 so the next person would feel obliged to match it.

On one occasion Kinvig struck on the way home from an appointment with probation officers at a Youth Offending Team which was trying to tackle his prolific life of crime.

The teenager told one victim money was needed to pay for stem cell treatment and told the father of a disabled child he was raising money for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.

Today Kinvig started 18 weeks in jail after Burnley Magistrates Court heard how he had run three almost identical cons and has already got a ‘huge’ record for dishonesty.

He started his criminal career in July 2009 and was locked up for eight months in January this year.

He was recently released and was on a curfew which he had flouted 59 times at the time of the latest cons.

The thefts were said to have given Kinvig a ‘buzz’ because it meant he could see the faces of the people he was about to con out of cash.

The court heard how on October 17 Kinvig had been given his four-week curfew after owning up to four counts of fraud, carried out on October 5, 7 and 12.

But within three weeks he breached it repeatedly by a total of 47 hours and was ‘back to his old tricks’, falsely claiming he needed money to send a sick child to America for treatment.

Police said he had claimed to a number of shops in the town centre that the money he was collecting for the treatment of a blind child.

Kinvig had carried around a sponsorship booklet in the name of Daniel Foster. The businesses he had targeted told officers Kinvig had posed as a fundraiser for the Bailey Foster Appeal.

This is a legitimate charity, which, raised around £40,000 between 2011 and 2012, for a three-year-old, from Ince, who was born with the rare condition septo-optic dysplasiam.  

Last year, Bailey flew to China with his parents for stem cell treatment.

Kinvig was caught after he went into Burnley library to use a computer to make bogus sponsor forms.

Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Kinvig produced a membership card at the counter but was challenged and was found to be registered under another name.

Officers spoke to several people who signed the bogus form. One victim said he had been in his local pub when Kinvig approached him and said a sick child needed treatment in America. A woman contacted gave a similar account.

Kinvig, of Westgate, Burnley, admitted possessing an article for use in fraud on November 4, obstructing police on November 6 and fraud by false representation between October 28 and November 4, in Lancashire.

The teenager also pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the curfew and theft of underwear worth £2.99, from B and M Bargains.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Philip Turner said his client had been in care until he was 18, there had been no parental guidance and little or no support from any outside agency since he came out of local authority care.

The solicitor added: ‘He had no money and was living at a place where he’s barely welcome. What he has done is resorted to his old tricks.

‘He has been going in public houses or businesses and targeting people who are robust enough to go out drinking or be in work and none of them say that he comes on heavy with them.’
