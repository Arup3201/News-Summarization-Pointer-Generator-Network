These touching pictures show baby chimpanzee Velu clinging to his mother for protection as he joins the rest of his family for the first time.

With his fresh pink face, the eight-week-old and his mother Heleen were integrated into the Budongo Trail enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo today.

The baby pure Western chimpanzee – an endangered species – is the first to be successfully reared in Scotland for 15 years.

Heleen had been gradually integrated into the Budongo Trail enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo but today was the first time baby Velu met his 18 other family members, who are originally from a zoo in the Netherlands

He can be seen tentatively clinging to his mother while the rest of the chimps in his family’s complex hierarchy swung on ropes and scavenged for food,

Though small and relatively bald at the moment, Velu will soon have a head of dark, spiky hair – but will probably stay tiny for another five years.

His mother Heleen is from a group of nine chimps who arrived at the zoo from the Netherlands in 2010.

The Dutch chimpanzees originally started life in a research laboratory, then were rehomed to Beekse Bergen Safari Park before moving to Edinburgh, where they live in the Budongo Trail enclosure.

After a shaky start, Heleen is said to be a ‘great mother’, grooming and protecting Velu who has been accepted by the other 18 chimps.

There is some doubt over the paternity of Velu, but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the group, Louis or Rene, is the father and a test is due to be carried out in the future.

Sophie Pearson, team leader at the Budongo Trail, said: ‘We are delighted with the arrival and successful integration of Velu into our chimpanzee group.

‘Still very young, Velu will look like a baby for another five years or so. He currently has a beautiful pale, pinky-coloured face which will darken as he gets older and has a mass of spiky hair.

Doubts remain over the paternity of Velu, but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the group - Louis or Rene - is his father. They will find out  when they do a paternity test, which is due to happen in the future

Heleen (pictured cradling baby Velu) had a tricky start but is said to be coping extremely well with motherhood and zookeepers say she is a ‘great mother’, grooming and protecting Velu who has been accepted by the group

‘At Edinburgh Zoo we are extremely proud that Heleen is successfully raising Velu and that he has been accepted into the group.

‘Chimpanzees learn from experience - they see their mothers and other group members give birth and raise youngsters - but unfortunately we suspect that Heleen did not have this experience in the earlier part of her life.

‘However, after a tricky start, Heleen is coping extremely well and developing into a great mother - she is nursing, grooming and protecting her baby.’

Chimpanzee groups have a complex social hierarchy and can be a volatile species, so staff at the zoo had to take care when reintroducing Heleen and Velu to the group.

Zookeepers intervened as little as they could but had to bottle-feed him in the first few days as Heleen (right) showed little interest in Velu (clinging to her)

The birth has boosted Heleen’s status in the group and Velu will probably grow to inherit his mother’s ranking, the zoo said.

‘After the birth, we slowly integrated Heleen and her baby back into the main chimpanzee group - starting first with other females and her closest male allies, then building up to them both going back into the main group,’ Ms Pearson said.

‘This has been successful to date and, although chimpanzee babies are always vulnerable, we are confident Heleen is fully integrated back into the group and has a lot of support from her chimp friends.

‘Hand-rearing a chimpanzees has a huge impact on the individual as they are extremely intelligent with complex needs. A hand-reared chimp may, in fact, never fully be an independent chimp.

‘With this in mind, keepers intervened as little as possible - Velu had to be bottle-fed by keepers for a few days at the beginning of his life because Heleen put him down and showed little interest in caring for him herself.

‘However, he was never out of Heleen’s sight and she was able to watch him being fed until she decided she wanted to take him back, which she did, to everyone’s delight.’

Chimpanzees are found in the rainforests of west and central Africa and staff at Edinburgh Zoo have tried to recreate the habit in the Budongo Trail enclosure.

It features three pods which vary in degrees of temperature, light and humidity to reflect different conditions of the rainforest.

‘Chimpanzee babies are absolutely gorgeous and the great thing about them from a visitor’s point of view is that they stay babyish for a very long time,’ Ms Pearson said.

‘A baby chimp doesn’t really start growing up until they are five years old, so he’ll be on his mother’s back and be very playful and look cute for several years.’
