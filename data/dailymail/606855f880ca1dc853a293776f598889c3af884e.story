West Ham’s summer of discontent is long forgotten and Sam Allardyce is turning the club around, according to captain Mark Noble.

The central midfielder has backed his manager to the hilt and believes the Hammers are heading in the right direction after testing times.

Allardyce’s job had looked under threat towards the back end of last season, but there have been encouraging signs at the beginning of this campaign - not least during a demolition of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, which saw new signing Mauro Zarate star in the 3-1 win.

Looking forward: West Ham skipper Mark Noble has backed Sam Allardyce to succeed at Upton Park

And any talk surrounding the 59-year-old’s potential departure is premature, says Noble, who applauded the club’s decision to remain stable, particularly given the club have only been back in the Premier League for two seasons.

‘He’s a top man and has taken all the stick on the chin, going about his business the way he always does,’ Noble told Sportsmail. ‘It’s slowly turning back on his side now – especially after the way we played against Spurs and Palace – and hopefully we can carry that on.

‘We’re used to the manager and the way he works. Obviously a lot was said about his job in the summer but he’s fought through that and has come out the other side.

‘He’s too experienced and been in the game for too long to allow that sort of stuff affect him.’

Noble freely admits that last season’s finish of 13th wasn’t good enough, but rejects the notion that West Ham weren’t a decent side to watch – a chief complaint from a section of the support.

‘There were many times last year when we played really well, didn’t score and then got beat by the odd goal. That comes around to bite you,’ he added. ‘No-one says how well you played – they just see the result.’

The summer addition of Mauro Zarate, who scored at Palace last weekend, looks to have arrested the problems in front of goal – so severe that Kevin Nolan’s seven had him above everyone else in May.

Teddy Sheringham has come in as a strikers' coach – visibly delighted when Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole scored at Palace – with rewards reaped already.

‘It’s been proven that Mauro’s a top player,’ Noble said. ‘He’s scored a lot of goals in different countries and hopefully the decision to bring him here pays off. He scored a brilliant goal on Saturday and we’re going to need him. Hopefully we’ll have a much better season.

‘He’s a lovely fella. He’s had a bit of bad publicity in the past for being quite temperamental but since he’s been here he’s been brilliant.’
