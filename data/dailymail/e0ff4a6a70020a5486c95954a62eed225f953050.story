Down in the dumps about your love life? If you've tried speed dating, love websites, grindr, tinder and the rest, but still despair of finding the perfect partner, a new venture could leave you flushed with romance.

Dating site DoingSomething.co.uk has launched a new singles event: Toilet Dating!

A dating website hopes to flush awkward first dates down the toilet by combining alcohol and a guided tour of London loos

The tour involves visiting public toilets and drinking while learning about their history and mingling with other singles

The concept is essentially a pub crawl, which due to the ice-breaking effects of alcohol has always been a popular first date activity.

However rather than quaint pubs or swanky bars, the tour stops off at public conveniences.

The website has teamed up with London Loo Tours to host one-of-a-kind events with a twist.

The new dating experience is currently being piloted in London throughout August, with plans to roll it out nationwide later this year, if all goes to plan.

Single men and women are led on a bar crawl around London's Westminster with stops at toilets of historical note along the way.

As well as loo puns galore, the evening contains tips and tricks for locating free public loos in London, the history of the lavatory from pre-Roman times to the present, and facts about the politics surrounding the public toilet.

Toilet Dating encourages singletons to share their own dating horror stories – toilet-related or not –  to flush away memories of bad dates.

Sometimes good old-fashioned candlelight and romance is just so boring...

In an over-saturated dating scene, it may be that this rather bizarre concept catches on across the country

A spokesman for DoingSomething.co.uk, comments: 'Nothing would be more awkward than having a first date in a toilet… until now.

‘At worst, the daters will have to indulge in some crap chat - but the experience won't be one they'll forget in a hurry.'
