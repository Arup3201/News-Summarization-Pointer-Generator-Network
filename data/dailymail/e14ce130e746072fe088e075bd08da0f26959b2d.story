A major coalition row erupted today over Lib Dem plans to overhaul the so-called 'bedroom tax'.

Nick Clegg was forced to insist he was not calling for it to be scrapped - despite reports he would axe it - but instead wanted changes to be made to the details.

But the Tories claimed he had never discussed the problems in private meetings, and pointed out that he had spent months defending the policy in public.  

The Lib Dems will now argue that the policy where working-age people who live in council housing and have spare rooms pay more must be changed.

The move creates a rift with the Lib Dems’ Conservative coalition partners who support the measure.

Last year Mr Clegg defended the policy in the House of Commons, telling a Labour MP that it would help the 1.8million people on the list waiting for a council house.

He said that there was a ‘mismatch’ in the benefits system between people needing a place to live and empty  bedrooms’, and even accused Labour of ‘baulking’ at taking tough decisions.

But last night it was claimed Mr Clegg no longer believes the policy works and will – like Labour – vow to reverse it ahead of next year’s general election.

Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, drove through the removal of the spare room subsidy last April.

He said he hoped it would make people with spare bedrooms downsize.

An academic study this week found that in the first six months of the policy, 4.5 per cent of those affected had downsized to a smaller property, which the ministry said was a ‘promising start’.

Writing in today’s Mirror newspaper, Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary  to the Treasury, said:  ‘Overwhelmingly, our benefit reforms are working, resulting in many more people gaining the independence and self-respect of re-entering work. 

'However with only one in 20 of affected claimants having successfully downsized, it’s clearly time to take stock and change our approach in this particular area.’

He said many people living in social housing were disabled or had other needs and could not find a smaller property. Several Lib Dem MPs have already come out against the policy.

But a Conservative spokesman said: 'The Lib Dems have never demanded the restoration of the spare room subsidy in private; and have campaigned for its abolition in public.

'Bringing the bloated Housing Benefit bill bill under control is a key part of our long term plan to fix welfare.

'Our reforms are working - and it's imperative we stick to them. The Conservatives are committed to this.'

And during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was forced to clarify that he was not adopting Labour's stance of axing the policy altogether. 

Mr Clegg told LBC 97.3: 'Unlike Labour, we are not sticking our heads in the sand. Of course you need to do something about housing benefit reform, of course you have to do something about overcrowding. Unlike the Conservatives, we want to do it as fairly as possible.

'The real trigger was that we published a report, commissioned by the Government itself, which simply showed it wasn't working in the way that was intended.

'I'm a practical man. I think that when something isn't working in the way that you planned for it to work, you fix it.'

Mr Clegg added that it was 'complete baloney' for the Conservatives to claim that they were surprised by the Lib Dem announcement: 'I've been constantly badgering away within Government with the DWP to try to make sure we really stress-test this properly.

Last February, Mr Clegg said: ‘The 
problem you cannot duck is that we have 1.8million households in this 
country who are waiting to get social housing provision and we have one 
million bedrooms which are standing empty.

‘That
 doesn’t make sense to have a benefits system that continues to support 
this mismatch between people needing places to live and empty bedrooms. 
That is what we are trying to address.’  

A senior Labour source said last night: ‘The Lib Dems are utter hypocrites. They have supported this policy for four years.’ 

Rules: Since April 2013, if a person of working age had a spare bedroom they cannot claim housing benefit for all their rent

This week Mr Duncan Smith said his department’s reforms to housing benefit had saved £6billion a year and the criticism of them had been ‘wildly exaggerated’.

Since April 2013, if a person of working age had a spare bedroom they cannot claim housing benefit for all their rent.

Tenants have to pay an extra 14 per cent if they have one spare bedroom, and 25 per cent for two.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'We spend around £24bn a year on housing benefit so we have a safety net in place.

'However It was simply wrong that the taxpayer was paying for social housing tenants to have spare bedrooms when around 300,000 people were living in overcrowded homes and around 1.7 million were on social housing waiting lists in England alone when the policy came into force.

'Especially because this rule already applies to housing benefit claimants in the private sector – introduced by the previous government.

'We have made £345m available to councils to help vulnerable people with the changes - including disabled people'.
