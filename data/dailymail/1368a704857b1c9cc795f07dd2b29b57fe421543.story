Protesters gathered in London today to call for an end to Israeli military action in Gaza as the conflict in the troubled region shows no sign of abating.

Pro-Palestine supporters carried placards with the messages 'Freedom for Palestine' and 'End Israel's attacks on Gaza' outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London.

One of the protestors was Susan Jhafouri, a 19-year-old student who has Afghan and Slovakian heritage.

Growing anger: Pro-Palestinian demonstrators stage a rally outside the Israeli embassy in London today

She said: 'It's inhuman to kill innocent children. I think the fight is between two presidents, not between the civilians.

I think Israel should stop the bombing campaign and explain what they want from Palestine and then negotiate.'

There are growing concerns about the anti-Semitic nature of some of the protests. One placard carried by a demonstrator bore images comparing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, whose Nazi regime killed millions of Jews in the Holocaust.

Mark Gardner, of the UK-based Jewish Community Trust, told The Jerusalem Post that the anger in anti-Israel demonstrations 'risks getting out of hand.'

He added: 'We are already seeing examples of intimidation and anti-Semitic abuse from groups of demonstrators. There is no excuse for this, but it comes as no surprise.

'The organisers of these demonstrations, whether Islamist groups or their far Left allies are playing with fire; and we have made the Metropolitan Police fully aware of this specific concern.'

The Israeli embassy also saw protests from those who support Palestine on Saturday, while on Sunday pro-Israeli protestors waving flags bearing the Star of David were at the site.

Today, Israeli airstrikes continued to pummel a wide range of locations in Gaza and diplomatic efforts intensified to end the fighting that has killed at least 609 Palestinians and 29 Israelis - 27 soldiers and two civilians.

The U.N. office of humanitarian affairs estimates that at least 75 per cent of the Palestinian deaths were civilians, including dozens of children.

The fate of another Israeli soldier who went missing following a deadly battle in the Gaza Strip remained unknown, a defense official said earlier today.

It was not immediately known if the missing soldier was alive or dead, the Israeli defense official told The Associated Press.

The disappearance raised the possibility that he had been captured by Hamas - a nightmare scenario for Israel. In the past, Israel has paid a heavy price in lopsided prisoner swaps to retrieve captured soldiers or remains held by its enemies.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Italy on Tuesday condemned the rise in anti-Semitic protests and violence over the conflict in Gaza, saying they will do everything possible to combat it in their countries.

'Anti-Semitic rhetoric and hostility against Jews, attacks on people of Jewish belief and synagogues have no place in our societies,' German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, France's Laurent Fabius and Italy's Federica Mogherini said in a joint statement issued in Brussels.

The three said that while they respect demonstrators' freedom of speech and right to assemble, they will also do everything possible to fight 'acts and statements that cross the line to anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia.'

Since the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, participants at anti-Israel demonstrations across Germany have frequently used anti-Semitic slogans and also called for Jews to be gassed - a reference to the killing of Jews by the Nazis in the Holocaust.

In Berlin on Tuesday afternoon, about 500 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched from the city's Potsdamer Platz to the landmark Brandenburg Gate, chanting slogans like 'Israel is murder' and 'Israel bombs, Germany finances.'

The most direct route for the march would have taken the protesters directly to Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, but police in riot gear steered them well around the monument to the 6 million Jews killed by Nazi Germany.

Police had to separate Berlin resident Bernd Wierer from a group of young male protesters after he started arguing with them about their chant: 'Israel is fascist.'

The 70-year-old said he was neither Jewish nor had any connections to Israel, but that Germany's Nazi past made it necessary for the country to be particularly vigilant about anti-Semitic slogans.

'They can demonstrate here, I support that, but you can't say those things in Germany,' he said.

In France, pro-Palestinian youths have clashed repeatedly with police, and on Sunday set fire to cars, pillaged stores and attacked two synagogues in the Paris suburbs. Italy has also seen nonviolent pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

Jewish groups have expressed shock and disgust about the growing anti-Semitism in Germany and other European countries with strong Muslim communities.

'We have reached a new level of hatred and violence in all of Europe that cannot even be compared to the anti-Semitism seen during previous conflicts in Israel,' said Stephan Kramer, director of the European office on anti-Semitism of the American Jewish Committee in Brussels.
