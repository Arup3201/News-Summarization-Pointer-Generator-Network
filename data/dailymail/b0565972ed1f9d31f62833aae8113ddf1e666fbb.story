Most travellers will be only too aware of how onerous it can be sitting next to a screaming baby at 30,000ft.

But one passenger’s ordeal was made a little more bearable after the parents of a 12-month old baby came up with a cunning plan to placate angry flyers.

The couple distributed sweets to passengers as a pre-emptive strike in anticipation of the infant causing havoc on board a flight earlier this week.

The parents of a 12-month old baby who feared their child would disrupt fellow travellers on a plane handed out sweets along with a note designed to appease passengers

The gesture was revealed on social networking site Reddit.com by a passenger who received one of the goodie bags from the parents ahead of take-off.

The gift bag also included a set of earplugs in case the child, called Madeline, began crying.

The passenger, who calls himself Ninjashares, posted a picture of the bag online underneath the message: ‘A baby just handed me this on my flight. I ain't mad.’

The note read: ‘Hi Stranger!

‘My name is Madeline. I will be 1 on December 17th and this is my first flight.

‘I’ll try to be on my best behaviour, but I’d like to apologize in advance if I lose my cool, get scared or my ears hurt.

‘My mom and dad packed you this goodies bag with a few treats.

‘There are also ear plugs in case my first public serenade isn’t as enjoyable to you as it is to my mom and dad.

‘Have a great flight!’

 It comes after a similar story in September 2012 when the parents of two 14-week-old twins distributed sweets to passengers in anticipation of the new-born babies disturbing other flyers

It comes after a similar story in September 2012 when the parents of two 14-week-old twins distributed sweets to passengers in anticipation of the new-born babies disturbing other flyers.

The innovative approach was again broadcast by Andrew Merritt, who received one of the goodie bags from Christina Diaz and Michael Rubinstein.

'Brilliant and thoughtful parents handed these out to everyone on my flight,' the appreciative traveller wrote on Reddit at the time, posting a picture of a Ziploc plastic bag filled with goodies and a note of explanation.

'We're twin baby boys on our first flight and we're only 14 weeks old!' the note read.

‘We'll try to be on our best behavior, but we'd like to apologize in advance just in case we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. 

'Our mom and dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear plugs available if you need them,' the note added.

The idea sparked chatter on the social news site, garnering over 3,000 comments and one million views after it was posted online.

Most of the reaction was positive with one user calling it the 'most considerate thing I've ever seen ... it has fully restored my faith in said consideration.'

But some thought it was a bit much.

'Really? You don't find this to be overkill?' one user chimed in.

'I don't require an apology for a crying baby on a plane. This is to be expected. I'm OK with it. People have babies, and they need to travel too, they added.
