Victor Valdes is facing a battle to be fit to play for Manchester United before next month.

The 32-year-old was being tipped to make a comeback in light of David de Gea's finger dislocation this week but sources at United say the posterior cruciate injury Valdes suffered is worse than first feared and tests are showing his knee is not yet up to the rigours of a Barclays Premier League game.

Although he is still expected to make a full recovery, his chances of signing and playing by Christmas look slim.

United manager Louis van Gaal gave a cryptic hint when asked whether Valdes could sign for the club in October, saying 'Manchester United has always their eyes open.'

Valdes posted that he was ready for action on his Instagram account but he is still in rehabilitation programmes that United staff have helped devise. 

Anders Lindegaard played in a behind closed doors friendly against Blackpool this week in case he was required to deputise for De Gea and the Dane is looking for a new club in January.

Even then United are prepared to turn to Ben Amos before risking Valdes at this stage.
