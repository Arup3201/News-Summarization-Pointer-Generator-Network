His wife called him 'nuts' for setting a $1 reserve price on their property, but the unexpected strategy paid off for Neil Tyagi- who sold his house in a Valentines Day auction for a well-earned $565,000. 

The 33-year-old transport worker listed the surprising reserve price for his house at 230 Blacktown Road, Blacktown just for fun to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to the auction.

Mr Tyagi told Daily Mail Australia that he had been slightly worried about the prospect of his four-bedroom two-bathroom home actually being whipped off the market for $1, but said he would just have to deal with it if it had happened.

Neil Tyagi set a reserve price of $1 on his property- but it sold for a respectable $565,000 

'I won't have a choice if it does sell for $1, we're going to have to cut our losses and let it go,' he said. 

Luckily for the transport worker, and his family, the property sold after about 20 bids for the respectable sum of $565,000- only $5000 more than the asking price.

While Mr Tyagi said that the family was over the moon to have sold the property, and for a fair amount more than $1, they were also quite relieved.

'We're all very tired ... all we're thinking about is lunch,' Mr Tyagi told Domain.

He said that all the attention the auction had attracted made the day more exciting. 

'That's what you want at an auction, the excitement... But we didn't think people would be so interested!'

The lucky new owner, Aishwani Sharma, said that he had actually known the family for many years, and wanted to offer a fair price for the property.

After the opening bid of $1, the auction quickly jumped to $30, then to $10,000, before Mr Sharms jumped in with his first offer of $400,000.

The house at 230 Blacktown Road, Blacktown was originally purchased for $300,000

Despite his family telling him he was 'nuts' Mr Tyagi said he wanted to do something memorable

'It was taking to long - and I brought my cheque book,' he explained.

Mr Sharma said the property would be a Valentine's Day surprise for his wife, who wasn't at the auction.  

Mr Tyagi earlier told Daily Mail Australia that he and his wife Maria never wanted to sell the house in the first place.  

When their circumstances changed and they were forced to put the house up for auction, Mr Tyagi saw it as an opportunity to have some fun.

'We didn't really want to sell the property in the first place so when it came about that we did have to sell and we said we might as well do something different, something special.' 

The couple bought their 576 square metre house in 2004 for $300,000 and hoped to sell for between $500,000 and $600,000. 

'My family think I'm crazy, my wife thinks I'm nuts,' Mr Tyagi said. 

Mr Tyagi's agent Raj Bhandari said he had been completely shocked when his client called him asking him to set the reserve for the house at $1.

The 33-year-old transport worker wanted his house in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1

Despite his agent telling him it was a bad idea, Mr Tyagi went ahead with his plan, claiming he wanted to do something special and believes he will make a huge profit

'I said noone has done it in NSW, I said mate that's not a good idea but he decided to do it anyway,' Mr Bhandari told Daily Mail Australia.  

'He's a businessman and he believes that setting a $1 reserve will create more competition and he may achieve a higher price than what the property could sell for.'

Mr Bhandari said he hasn't slept since Mr Tyagi's bizarre request and revealed that he and his team had been working around the clock to ensure they weren't left 'left red-faced' following the February 14 auction.  

Mr Tyagi said earlier that he knew the risks involved but believes he had a good chance of making a profit due to the booming property market.

'There's a fair bit of buyers in the market  and we're hoping to achieve a fair price for us and for the buyers. We're not expecting something that's above market price but we're hoping we can achieve something fair.' he said.
