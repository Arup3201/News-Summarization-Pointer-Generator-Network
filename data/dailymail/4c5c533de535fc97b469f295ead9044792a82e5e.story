It's an unlikely venue for the dramatic culmination of a major world-wide hunt to recover a stolen Rembrandt masterpiece.

But police may have discovered a treasured work by the Dutch artist during a dramatic swoop on Croydon High Street.

In an extraordinary twist in an operation to recover the proceeds of crime, officers are thought to have found a missing oil on canvass.

Masterpiece: Experts have been called into examine the work which is thought to be by legendary artist Rembrandt, pictured in this self-portrait

Police were seen treating the potentially 
precious object with extreme caution 
as they removed the work from the building in south London following the raid on Monday June 11.

Now experts have been called in to examine the work of art to establish if the work recovered, really is a Rembrandt masterpiece.

Scotland Yard, who are being  tight-lipped about which one of the 205 currently missing works by the Dutch master, also arrested a businessman in his sixties.

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's specialist crime directorate made the discovery during a long-running investigation aimed at recovering assets from criminals.

Security expert Richard Ellis, who has worked with the Met Police's specialist Art and Antiques squad, said: 'If this is a genuine Rembrandt oil painting, I think £2million would be a massive undervaluation.

'If you were to put one before an auction today it would fetch between £30million and £50million.

Mr Ellis, who last year was part of the 
team which recovered two paintings by Pablo Picasso stolen from a Swiss 
exhibition in 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia, added: 'To sell a real Rembrandt on the open market would be really, really difficult.

'Any buyer undertaking their due 
diligence would look at the catalogues of Rembrandts and it wouldn't 
take them very long to see it was stolen.'

'Stealing to order is fiction. They 
may get stolen and used as a form of currency or as collateral.

'The 
media would publish the valuation at the time of the theft and the 
criminal would work on the basis that it would be worth to them anywhere between three and ten per 
cent, because that's what it can get passed across on the black market.

'It acts as a sort of international currency.'

The unnamed businessman was taken to a police station in Croydon, near his home in Surrey, and released on bail.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A man
in his 60s was arrested in south London on June 11 in connection with 
an ongoing Proceeds of Crime Act investigation.

‘He has been bailed to return to a south London police station on a date in July pending further inquiries.

‘A number of items have been seized in connection with the investigation.’

The
suspected masterpiece by the 17th century Dutch artist is understood to
have been seized in the raid on premises in Croydon High Street.

Priceless: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is still missing after a theft from a museum in 1990

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606 - 1669) was the greatest Dutch painter of his age and is one of the most important figures in European art and highly prized among thieves.

His work The Storm On The Sea Of Galilee - Rembrandt's only known seascape - was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, USA, in 1990, during a $300million art work raid.

It has not yet been recovered.

During another 'well planned heist' a Rembrandt drawing worth $250,000, was stolen from a Los Angeles hotel, last year.

But it was recovered at a nearby church following an anonymous tip-off.

Experts from the Linearis Institute, which owns the pen-and-ink work, known as 'The Judgment,' later verified its authenticity.

Authorities said the drawing was snatched as a curator was distracted by a guest at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Marina del Rey.

County
Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said: 'When the curator turned back 
to the Rembrandt, it was gone. It was a well-thought-out, well-executed 
theft.'

There are no 
suspects in custody, and authorities are not commenting on how the 
drawing wound up at the church on Ventura Boulevard in the city about 25
miles from Los Angeles.

Whitmore said: 'We got an anonymous tip because there was so much news coverage.

'That
really was the turning point. The news coverage led people to call us 
and say, "Hey, I've seen this, and this is where I've seen it."

We responded, and they were right. There it was.'

They
have asked anyone who spotted anything suspicious to contact the 
sheriff's department, which is working with security officials from the 
hotel.

One of his most famous works was The 
Night Watch, a group portrait of one of Amsterdam’s militia companies 
and The Syndics of the Clothmakers Guild painted in 1662.

In December 2009, his Portrait of a Man sold at auction for £29,200,000 at Christie’s.
