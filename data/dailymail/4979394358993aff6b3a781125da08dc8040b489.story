Loss: Cal player Ted Agu, 21, has passed away after collapsing during a run with teammates

A California college football player has died after collapsing during a conditioning run.

Ted Agu, 21, a defensive end for the University of California in Berkeley, passed away on Friday morning, school officials said in a statement.

Greg Kragen, a former NFL player with the
 Denver Broncos and the father of another Cal defensive end, said 
his son told him a player passed out during a team run, Mercury News reported.

Another source told the newspaper that Agu later died at a local hospital.

It is not yet known why he passed out. The school said it would release further information about the incident at a later date.

Agu, a public health major from Bakersfield, California, had played in seven out of the 12 games during his junior season, recording six tackles.

'At this time, we are deeply saddened
 to inform you that Ted Agu, one of our student-athletes and a member of
 our football team, passed away tragically this morning,' the Cal 
statement read.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Ted's family and 
friends, our players and coaches, and our University family.'

Coach Sonny Dykes added: 'This is a very difficult time for our 
football family.

'Ted was a remarkable 
young man and a member of this family who was highly respected and loved
 by his teammates and coaching staff. He had an incredible passion for 
life and will be deeply missed.'

Agu, who played football for the school without a scholarship, was surprised by the coach at a team meeting last March with the
 news he was being put on scholarship.

In a video last spring with CalTV, Agu called it 'an unbelievable experience'.

The school said it is providing counseling sessions for the other players.

Teammates took to Twitter to express their sadness.

'The best example of a true Cal football player,' freshman lineman Eril Bunte wrote. 'On and off the field... one of the best men I had the HONOR of knowing.'

Tributes: Friends and teammates called him a smart student who always looked out for others

Freshman Jonah Hodges added: 'Prayers out to ted and his family guy was
 incredibly smart would help me and the other younger guys whenever we 
needed it in the classroom.'

Marvin Jones Jr, a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals, added: 'I am deeply saddened by the news of my old locker mate's passing. He had one of the biggest hearts and was one of the most ambitious young men around.

'To my Cal family keep your heads up, stay close together, look out for one another... You just never know when it's your last chance to do so.'

New England Patriot Shane Vareen, also a Cal alum, said: 'My love and prayers go out to the family of Ted Agu. Such a sad day for All of us. Ted is and always will be apart of our Golden Bear family.'
