The elfin child with the big personality and bright smile calls herself 'the first lady' and dreams of the future. But doctors say 12-year-old Ontlametse Phalatse has only another couple of years to live.

'I call myself a first lady because I'm the first black child with this disease ... Which other black child do you know with this disease?' she challenged.

Ontlametse is the first black child diagnosed with progeria, a rare and fatal genetic condition that accelerates the aging process, the Progeria Research Foundation said.

Ontlametse Phalatse, 12, was diagnosed with the rare, fatal and genetic aging condition progeria

The disorder is said to have inspired the Brad Pitt movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which he is born an old man and ages backwards.

Nobody knows how many kids in the world have it.

In a two-year campaign to identify them,
 the Progeria Research Foundation says the number of children diagnosed 
around the world has soared from 48 to 80 on five continents.

The foundation's executive director, Audrey Gordon, says only two Africans have been diagnosed and both live in South Africa â€” Ontlametse and a 5-year-old white girl. That is probably because South Africa, an economic powerhouse, offers some of the best medical care on the continent.

Gordon says there are several black holes on the map in her office studded with colored tacks where they have found children living with progeria.

'We know that there are children (with progeria) in Africa, in China and Russia, but we just can't seem to get to them,' she said in a telephone interview from the foundation's office in Peabody, Massachusetts.

Ontlametse's mother, Bellon Phalatse, says her baby was born looking normal but that she realized early on that something was wrong. The baby suffered constant rashes and by the time she was three months old Phalatse thought she had a skin disease.

Phalatse's father abandoned the family when she was three years old, years before her strange rashes and nail loss was diagnosed as the deadly disorder

Always a bright student Phalatse, right, hopes to be a psychologist one day so she can help other people with their problems

Before Ontlametse celebrated her 
first birthday 'her hair was falling, her nails weren't normal, the skin
 problems, we were going up and down to the doctors.'

The disorder may have inspired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which Brad Pitt is born an old man

As the child aged prematurely, her father abandoned the family when Ontlametse was three years old.

Despite her frequent illnesses, 
Ontlametse enrolled in school at six and proved a bright pupil. But she 
was often scorned by classmates, teachers and others who thought she was
 so small and skinny because she had AIDS.

South Africa has the highest number of 
people living with AIDS of any country but the disease still carries a 
terrible social stigma.

'It was horrible, I don't know how to explain' what we went through, Phalatse said.

It was not until two years ago that a doctor friend suggested she have Ontlametse tested for progeria, and brought her a book about the disease.

It included pictures. Children with progeria look remarkably similar, despite different ethnic backgrounds: small and bald with oversized heads, eyes that bulge a bit, gnarled hands. They suffer from thinning skin which has a network of blue veins showing on the heads of white children.

Phalatse said she knew immediately, and a doctor confirmed the diagnosis.

One of the things on Phalatse's wish list is a wig. Here she is in her 'Hannah Montana' bedroom, created for her by the Reach For A Dream Foundation, which fullfills the dreams of kids with terminal illnesses

'I'm very happy now that I understand what causes progeria,' Phalatse said.

Phalatse has sensitive eyes and the disease's classic traits: small and bald with oversized heads, eyes that bulge a bit and thinning skin

The
 diagnosis came with the news that most children with the disease die at
 13. But it also brought a better understanding of what they can do to 
try to prolong Ontlametse's life, and it has brought her the specialized
 care she needs.

Each school holiday, Ontlametse and her 
mom fly to the United States, where she participates in research funded 
by the Progeria Research Foundation at Children's Hospital Boston.

It 
gives her access to cutting edge drugs that are not yet commercially 
available.

Back home, they struggle to feed her the
 required healthy diet. Phalatse is unemployed and the two survive on 
her daughter's government disability allowance.

Ontlametse is unfazed: 'Sometimes when my mommy has money, she buys lettuce and cucumbers and I help her do salad.'

At school, Ontlametse keeps her hat on her head, self-conscious of her bald head. One of the things on her wish list is a specially designed wig.

She has two friends in her class but says not all her classmates are kind, but it doesn't bother her.

'I don't care what people say about 
me,' she says, making a throwaway motion with a hand misshapen with 
arthritis, knobby fingers and discolored nails.

In her rundown brick home in the small town of Hebron about 50 miles north of Johannesburg, Ontlametse ditches the hat.

She does her homework, reading, watches TV and has daily chores like washing her socks and cleaning her shoes.

She can't play sports or even a game of hopscotch because physical exercise tires her out.

Asked what she would like to be, she breaks into a big grin that shows irregular teeth.

Her classmates and teachers used to scorn her, assuming she had AIDS due to her small, skinny stature

She loves to read but he can't play sports or even a game of hopscotch because physical exercise tires her out too much

'I would like to be a psychologist,' she
 says, 'so that I can work on the problems of other people and so that 
they can accept the way that they are because they can see that I accept
 the way I am.'

That she would live that long would require a miracle. Children with progeria die almost exclusively from heart disease between the ages of 8 and 21, commonly suffering high blood pressure, strokes, angina, enlarged heart and heart failure.

Gordon said research into progeria has had remarkable success since her family founded the foundation in 1999, after her nephew was diagnosed with the disease.

In 2003, the foundation was instrumental in the discovery of the progeria gene. Now they hope it can help provide answers about the ordinary aging process and cardiovascular disease.
