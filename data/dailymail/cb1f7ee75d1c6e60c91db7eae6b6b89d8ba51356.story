Amanda Knox has clarified statements she made to an Italian newspaper yesterday when she said that if she is re-convicted for the murder of her former roommate in an ongoing retrial then she will go on the lam.

Today she put out a statement through her lawyers saying that if she is found guilty, 'legally I'll be defined as a "fugitive," but I will continue to fight for my innocence.'

'I will not willingly submit myself to injustice.'

This comes after she told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'If I am convicted then I will be, as they say, on the run.’

Rewording her thoughts: Amanda Knox has clarified an earlier statement where she said she would go on the run if she is convicted of her roommate's murder

Knox, 26, has stayed in Seattle while there is an Italian retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Her ex boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has been present for the trial and while they have not seen each other since they were released from prison, they have been in touch.

’I have spoken to Raffaele... he is more optimistic than me,' she told La Repubblica.

Knox and Sollecito are accused of stabbing Ms Kercher to death and sexually assaulting her while the young women were studying abroad in Perugia in 2007.

Knox has not appeared and explained 
herself saying: ’It was a really painful decision not to attend the 
retrial. I wanted to come. I wanted to be present in court.

‘I was put in jail for four years with no proof, but on suppositions.’

This latest interview is not the first time that Knox made it clear that she has no intentions of returning to prison for the murder.

First time around: Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were the immediate suspects in Meredith Kercher's murder and their behavior in the days following the discovery of her dead body surprised many

'I was already imprisoned as an innocent person in Italy and I can't reconcile the choice to go back with that experience,' she told The Today Show's Matt Lauer during a September 2013 interview following the release of her book.

One other wish of hers that has not yet come true is the hope that she can meet with Meredith's family so that she could personally tell them she was not involved.

'When I saw (the Kerchers) in court I 
wanted to speak with them and I asked my lawyers if I could do that. My 
lawyer approached them but their lawyers rejected it.’

’I want to speak to them. I want to tell them I had nothing to do with Meredith's death, that I liked her and we were friends.

When asked about Knox's comments, the
 Kercher family's lawyer Francesco Maresca said: ’Amanda is the accused.
 This is the moment of the accused. She should stop her declarations.’

Sollecito's defense lawyer told the appeals court Thursday that the young lovers were blamed by authorities for the murder to calm fears that a monster was loose in their Italian university town.

Defender Giulia Bongiorno said Sollecito and Knox were identified as suspects by police in a 'record' four days after the murder because authorities 'did not want to think that a stranger, a monster, could have entered a house and murdered a student'.

Bongiorno said much of the evidence later used to convict the pair in their first trial - including the presumed murder weapon found in Sollecito's kitchen drawer and a clasp that had been ripped from Kercher's bra - had not even been gathered by investigators at that point.

Bongiorno, on the last day of closing arguments in the pair's third trial, showed a court slides and videos in a bid to dismantle the prosecution's case. Sollecito sat at her side.

If she is convicted prosecutors have 
demanded Knox be jailed for 30 years and would seek her extradition from
 the United States.

Prior to the retrial, Sollecito had been spending a considerable 
amount of time in the Dominican Republic, and though he also risks jail, he has 
insisted he will remain in Italy for the verdict.
