A Boston bombing survivor who lost both of her legs in the deadly blast has revealed her astonishing recovery by rock climbing less than seven months on.

Video footage shows Celeste Corcoran, who lost her one leg above the knee and one below the knee, scaling the wall with the help of a therapist while undergoing treatment in Orlando this week.

With astonishing ease, the 48-year-old from Lowell, Massachusetts raises her prosthetic limbs to rest her feet on the rocks before eventually reaching the top with a massive grin and a satisfied 'yes!'

The video was uploaded to Corcoran's Facebook page on Tuesday with the caption: 'Here is some video from today's rock climbing. I think the caption here should be #*^# You Terrorists!

Unbelievable: Celeste Corcoran, who lost both her legs in the Boston bombings in April, shows off her amazing recovery by rock climbing in a therapy session on Monday

Joy: Celeste, who was fitted with new limbs last week, shouted 'yes!' when she reached the top

The footage is just the latest update on Corcoran's inspiring journey. In September, she used new prosthetic limbs to walk on stage on the Katie Couric show without even breaking a sweat.

She had been with her daughter, 18-year-old Sydney, on Boylston Street waiting for her sister to finish the Boston Marathon when the bombs exploded, killing three and injuring more than 280.

People rushed to help them, including Corcoran's husband Kevin, 48, who fashioned a tourniquet from his belt and asked a stranger to make another. A spectator, Matt Smith, tended to Sydney, whose leg had been torn with shrapnel.

Celeste became one of the 16 people to lose one or two limbs in the April 15 blasts.

Her daughter Sydney was hit with shrapnel and suffered severe arterial injuries, which left her to confined to a wheelchair, and together the women spent weeks recovering in hospital.

But the teenager has also shown 
astonishing reserve, receiving her high school diploma and being crowned
prom queen at Lowell High School. She is now attending Merrimack 
College.

In another feat of 
endurance in October, Celeste Corcoran joined amputees, their families 
and physical therapists at the Harvard athletic fields.

Wearing
her yellow ‘Boston Strong’ hat, Ms Corcoran navigated her way across 
the artificial turf on her artificial legs, a volunteer on each arm to 
keep her upright.

Corcoran, 
pausing to choke back tears, said: 'I've always wanted to be a runner 
but I used to get shin splints. I don't have shins anymore, so I'm 
hoping.

'I just want to be able to do the things 
that I did before... So many people have my back, I feel like I can do 
it. I'm trying my hardest to enjoy being alive.'

Last week, she was fitted with new legs in Orlando. The above-the-knee prosthetic has a computerized knee to help her bend the limb.

Another video shows her walking around the therapy room with impressive speed.

'Day one of Celeste walking on her new 
prosthetics,' the captions reads. 'Strong, steady, and tremendous balance! Unbelievable!! So 
happy to be part of such an incredible process!'
