Microsoft’s Universal Foldable Keyboard does what it says on the tin.

The wireless board connects via Bluetooth to any iOS, Android and Windows device to make typing easier than on a touchscreen.

It has a full-size keyset but folds in half to make it easier to fit in a bag or pocket.

Portable: Because the board is designed to work with multiple devices, Microsoft has ditched the Windows key as well as function keys from its original Universal Keyboard

The UFK was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and is follow up to the Washington-based company’s non-folding version announced last year.

It is sold in addition to the keyboards specifically designed for the firm’s range of Surface tablets.

To use the keyboard, unfold it and it will search for Bluetooth-enabled devices.

Select the keyboard from the Bluetooth list on a phone or tablet and pair the devices. Once connected, the board will link automatically when paired devices are in range.

A team of designers has created a folding keyboard that fits easily in a pocket and contains eight so-called 'ultra smart' keys that cover all 26 letters of the alphabet.

TextBlade uses software mapping to recognise and learn which keys the user is typing, and this is said to offer the same full spacing as on a standard desktop keyboard.

The $99 (£65) TextBlade was designed by California-based WayTools.

It consists of three pieces that are held together by magnets, either when folded together or assembled in front of a tablet or phone. This includes the two rows of keys, and a wrist rest.

There are eight so-called ‘ultra smart’ keys that contain the 26 letters of the alphabet, numbers, and punctuation marks.

WayTools claims TextBlade offers the same full 0.7-inch (19mm) finger spacing seen on desktops, while being half as thick as a 0.2-inch (7.1mm) iPhone 6.

When laid flat, the board is 0.1-inch (5mm) thick and when folded it stays together using magnets

It is also water repellant and features a fabric that prevents it from slipping on a surface

Plus the board can pair with two devices at the same time.

Because the board is designed to work with multiple devices, Microsoft has ditched the Windows key as well as function keys from its original Universal Keyboard.

When laid flat, the board is 0.1-inch (5mm) thick and when folded it stays together using magnets. It is also water repellant and features a fabric that prevents it from slipping on a surface.

The board will last for up to three months on a single charge before needing to be recharged via microUSB.

Microsoft said the board will go on sale in July and costs $99.95 (£62).
