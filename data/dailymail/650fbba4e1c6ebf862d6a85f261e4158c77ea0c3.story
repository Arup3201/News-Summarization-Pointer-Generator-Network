If you’re running out of sockets for all your gadgets, there is now a simple solution.

Midlands-based Group Gear is selling a power plate complete with two UK 3-pin sockets, as well as two built-in USB ports. 

The £20 device fits any backbox, up to a depth of 25mm, and is fitted by unscrewing the existing socket and replacing it with the new plate.

The £20 USB socket, pictured, is available from Midlands-based firm Group Gear. The plate features two standard UK 3-pin sockets and two USB ports. It fits any backbox up to a depth of 25mm and USB ports are limited to 2 Amps, meaning only the required power is delivered to the devices

The 2 Amp Intelligent Split Power Supply gives a superior charging rate over other Standard USB Charging Plates.

Rather than limiting the individual ports to half the overall allowance per port, resulting in slower charging times, the Group Gear USB Charging Plate can power up to 2 Amp from one port.

It fits any standard double backbox with a minimum depth of 25mm.

It is surge and spike protected, meaning it protects devices from damaging power increases.

If no device is connected, the transformer shuts down and power is not supplied to the USB ports.

Once a device is plugged in this activates the amplifier and power is supplied to the required USB ports.

Many gadgets, from phones to tablets and cameras, feature a micro-USB to USB cable that either plugs into a laptop port, or connects to a 3-pin plug.

Other devices feature a proprietary connector, including Apple's Lightning range, connected to a USB.

This plate lets people charge four of these devices at the same time.

And because the USB ports are limited to 2 Amps, only the required power is delivered to the individual gadgets.

If the current exceeds this, it automatically trips off to protect the products.

The 3-pin sockets have an output of 13A, 250V AC.

‘Fed up of running out of sockets? You need the revolutionary solution for USB charging’, explained Group Gear.

‘The
 two USB ports [allow] you to free up your UK mains sockets for use with
 other appliances. An easy swap and you’re set-up for fast USB 
charging.’

If no device is connected, the transformer shuts down and power is not supplied to the USB ports (pictured). Once a device is plugged in this activates the amplifier and power is supplied to the required USB ports

Last month, images created by 
Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, revealed how a new USB Type-C connector 
is expected to look when it launches later this year.

It
 has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as 
tablets and ultrabooks, and solves the annoying problem of inserting 
drives the wrong way up.

Users of older devices will need an adapter to use the new Type-C plugs.

The plate conforms to European Stand-by Mode and is BS and CE approved.

The company said various metal finishes and a single faceplate with 2 USB ports will be available soon.
