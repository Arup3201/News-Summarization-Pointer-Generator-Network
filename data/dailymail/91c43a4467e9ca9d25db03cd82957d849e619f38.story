A lost chapter of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is to be revealed to coincide with book's anniversary

A lost chapter of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is to be revealed today – 50 years after Roald Dahl’s most famous book was published.

In the missing section from the 1961 draft, mysterious confectioner Willy Wonka took children who won a tour of his factory to the Vanilla Fudge Room – only for the passage to be cut from the published version.

But the unused chapter, which introduces two extra naughty characters – Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice – was found among Dahl’s papers after his death at 74 in 1990.

Now, the Roald Dahl estate has released the chapter to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the novel in October.

Dahl was drafting his first version of Charlie And The Chocolate factory when he published James And The Giant Peach in 1961 – but it was reportedly binned after his young nephew said it was rubbish.

The draft section tells how penniless but kind-hearted Charlie Bucket – who in this version is accompanied to the factory by his mother rather than Grandpa Joe – visit Vanilla Fudge Mountain with the other children. 

Hundreds of men use picks and drills to work away at what Dahl called the ‘colossal jagged mountain as high as a five-storey building’ made of ‘pale-brown, creamy, vanilla fudge’.

Dahl – who also wrote Matilda, The Fantastic Mr Fox and George’s Marvellous Medicine – told how huge chunks of fudge tumble down the mountain before being collected by cranes and dumped on to open wagons.

But Tommy and Wilbur ignore Wonka’s warnings and jump on the wagons which enter a tunnel that leads to the Pounding and Cutting Room where the fudge is pounded by a huge machine and cut with knives.

Unsurprisingly, nothing more is heard of the two boys. The chapter also reveals several changes made to the original draft before it was published in the US in 1964 and the UK in 1967. 

The 1961 draft was found among Roald Dahl's papers after his death at 74 in 1990 and has now been released

Two other children who did not make it into the book are mentioned – Augustus Pottle and Miranda Grope – and the Oompa-Loompas who work in the factory were first called Whipple-Scrumpets.

When Dahl returned to the book after ignoring his nephew’s advice, his agent Sheila St Lawrence suggested it should have ‘more humour, more light Dahlesque touches throughout’, according to a biography. 

It is thought to have sold more than 30million copies in the UK.
