A City trader who spent £1million renovating his Georgian townhouse with the profits from an insider dealing scam must pay back £1.5million - or face another four years in jail.

James Sanders, 36, purchased a five-storey, £5million townhouse in Kensington, west London after making a fortune from illegal deals.

He and his wife Miranda, 35, were jailed last June and have now been ordered repay large sums of money within six months or face being jailed for another four years.

Sanders, who once boasted to his 
father how he would 'cane it' on the back of the tip-offs, drew up a 
plan on how he intended to blow his wealth.

The
 owner of brokerage company Blue Index had allocated himself a £100,000 
car fund, and set aside £500,000 for 'miscellaneous' items, including 
watches, clothes, holidays and wine.

He
 was jailed for four years last June after admitting eight counts of 
insider dealing between November 2006 and February 2008 and two counts 
of encouraging others to deal.

Sanders
 had coaxed others to profit from the illicit deals and Blue Index 
clients made in excess of £12million in just two years.

Miranda
 Sanders was jailed for ten months for taking advantage of insider 
information passed on to her by her San Francisco-based sister Annabel 
McClellan, 39.

McClellan, 
who also developed a sexually explicit social networking business called
 ‘My Nookie’, served 11 months in a US federal prison for obstructing an
 investigation into a racket.

International: James Sanders (left) and his wife Miranda (right) were also tipped off about deals worked on by her brother-in-law Arnold - a partner at financial firm Deloitte who handled major US company takeovers

Judge
 Nicholas Loraine-Smith said as well as the illegal trades James Sanders
 had also benefited from the ‘enhanced reputation’ of Blue Index which 
saw profits rocket to £5.5million by 2007.

He said: ‘The defendant himself has concluded that he did profit from the enhanced reputation of his company.’

The judge ordered Sanders to pay back £1,560,782.58, and his wife to repay £892,111.92.

The money must be received within six months or the pair face having their sentences extended.

Sanders
 and his wife had been tipped off about takeover deals being worked on 
by McClellan’s husband Arnold - a partner with financial firm Deloitte 
who handled major US company takeovers.

With
 their massive profits, Sanders and his wife spent £35,000 on a wine 
cellar for their home in Edwardes Place in Kensington as part of a 
£1million renovation.

They 
also paid off a mortgage on a second home in Campden Hill Road, Holland 
Park - valued at £3.75million - and funded their two young children’s 
private educations.

Investigators
 from the Financial Services Authority recovered James Sanders' written 
plan, which he had scribbled on Blue Index headed notepaper above the 
slogan 'The best way to trade.'

Rich: Miranda Sanders' sister Annabel McClellan (left) was 
later sentenced to 11 months in a US prison for her part in the scam. James Sanders (right) allocated himself a £100,000 'car fund' and £50,000 for luxuries

List: Investigators from the Financial Services Authority recovered James Sanders' written spending plan, which he had scribbled on Blue Index headed notepaper above the slogan 'The best way to trade'

He wrote a series of entries above a £1,610,000 total breaking down how he wanted to spend the money: £60,000 
on two sets of premium bonds, £50,000 on watches, clothing, holidays and
 wine, £100,000 on cars, and £150,000 on improvements to his home in 
Campden Hill Road.

In Sanders’ police interview he told police how he had also used the illegal profits to buy his home.

'As I recall it was used for the purchase of property at Edwardes Place,' he told investigators.

'The
 profits from the trading and money I have earned from Blue Index were 
used to pay off the mortgage at Campden Hill Road and put the rest in a 
savings account,' he added.

He
 also boasted in the police interview, saying: ‘You know through the 
last year I have spent close to £1million on Edwardes Place... It cost 
me and arm and leg to do that.’

James
 Sanders admitted eight counts of insider dealing between November 2006 
and February 2008 and two counts of encouraging others to deal, while 
his wife admitted five counts of insider dealing.
