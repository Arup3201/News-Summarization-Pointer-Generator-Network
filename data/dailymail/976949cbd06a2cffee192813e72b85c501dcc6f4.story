It details the environmental impact of the new high-speed rail line.

Alas, at 50,000 pages - the equivalent of 34 copies of War And Peace - this particular government document will have a pretty hefty impact on the environment all by itself.

It will take ten trees worth of paper to print just one copy of the report, which is part of the hybrid bill for the proposed London to Birmingham rail line.

Plans: The document will set out the noise and visual effects of phase one of HS2, from London to Birmingham, as well as its impact on businesses, farmers and traffic congestion (file picture)

A hybrid bill is a mixture of a public and private bill. This means the changes to the law it proposes would affect the general public, but would also have a significant impact on specific groups.

Because it is part of a bill, the environmental statement has to be delivered to Parliament as a hard copy – which, at more than half a ton, will weigh almost as much as a Smart Car.

The report will also have to be printed for every local authority along the HS2 line.

The Department for Transport, however, does not agree with government protocol that all bills must be printed, and is urging Commons authorities to allow it to deliver the statement in electronic format.

Last night a spokesman said discussions were ongoing, but that the decision may require a Commons vote.

Taking the train: Meanwhile a report has claimed that the number of British rail passengers travelling long distance will increase to 239million by 2020, compared with 169million in 2011

The document will set out the noise and 
visual effects of phase one of HS2, from London to Birmingham, as well 
as its impact on businesses, farmers and traffic congestion.

A report has claimed that 
the number of British rail passengers travelling long distance will 
increase to 239million by 2020, compared with 169million in 2011.

This
is the biggest growth across Europe – but the UK will still trail 
France and Germany in the number of passengers who will be travelling at
high speed on these journeys, according to the report from technology 
company Amadeus.

A similar document will be produced 
later in the year for phase two of the line, which will go north from 
Birmingham along two branches, stopping at cities including Leeds and 
Manchester.

The Department of Transport is set to face further criticism over the controversial HS2 scheme because it is speeding up legislation.

A so-called paving bill will be introduced after the Queen’s Speech in May, to authorise ministers to spend about £150million on the project before it gains full parliamentary approval.

The money will fund design work on the line and the trains, as well as ecological surveys.

Sources said the move was intended to demonstrate the Government was ‘cracking on’ with the scheme.
