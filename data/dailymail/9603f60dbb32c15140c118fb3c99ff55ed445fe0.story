West Ham are exploring the possibility of signing Shakhtar Donetsk striker Facundo Ferreyra.

The 23-year-old Argentine is unsettled at Shakhtar owing to the growing unrest in Ukraine.

Newcastle, Sunderland and QPR have also been offered the chance to take him on loan with view to a permanent deal.

He has an Italian passport so would not need a work permit.

West Ham aim to complete Carl Jenkinson's signing from Arsenal also.
