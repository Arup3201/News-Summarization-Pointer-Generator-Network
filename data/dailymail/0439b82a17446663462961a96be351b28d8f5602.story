Chelsea new boy Juan Cuadrado is beginning to settle into London life with the help of his Colombian teammate David Ospina, as they put their club rivalries to one side.

The 26-year-old completed his £27million move to Stamford Bridge from Fiorentina during the transfer window - which saw Mohamed Salah go the other way on loan. 

Cuadrado, who could feature in Saturday's game against Aston Villa, took to Instagram to thank Ospina for helping him settle in.

'Thanks buddy d_ospina1 for the invitation, blessings.'

Ospina followed suit and posted the same photograph on his Instagram commenting: 'Best wishes buddy.' 

The duo starred for Colombia during the World Cup and can now look forward to coming up against each other when Arsenal and Chelsea meet at the Emirates in April.

Cuadrado joins the club at a vital point in the season with the title race hotting up between the Blues and Manchester City.

The ex-Fiorentina man was pictured training with his new teammates earlier this week and Jose Mourinho will be hoping that the explosive winger can add another dimension to his squad.

While Cuadrado is expected to make an instant impact, it's taken Ospina a little while to establish himself as Arsenal's number one but he's grasped the opportunity with both hands.

The goalkeeper has kept three clean sheets in his last three Premier League games, including one in the Gunners impressive 2-0 victory at the Etihad.

Arsenal travel to White Hart Lane on Saturday lunchtime to face arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur, in what will be Ospina's first taste of the North London derby.
