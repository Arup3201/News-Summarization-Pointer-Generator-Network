Click here to read Sportsmail's exclusive interview with Radamel Falcao's father 

Radamel Falcao, Manchester United’s Colombia striker, once tried to get a British passport — because his great-grandfather came from Yorkshire.

Falcao was 13 when his father visited the British embassy to ask whether the teenage talent was eligible, but he was one branch too far down on the family tree.

‘I’m proud of my English blood,’ declared Radamel Snr after Sportsmail tracked him down to Bogota, where he revealed the story of how George King, Falcao’s great-grandfather, left England in 1932 for a new life in South America.

‘Falcao was probably about 13 so I went down to the embassy thinking that a British passport would help him with a move to Europe,’ he said. ‘But unfortunately it got rejected.’ 

The 28-year-old signed for United on deadline day in a £6million loan deal from Monaco. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 home win against Everton on October 5.

‘I’m proud of my English blood,’ Radamel says extending his arm and patting down on his veins as he sits finishing lunch in La Cueva del Tigre (The Tiger’s Cave) bar. ‘My grandfather was English and also a sportsman.’ 

Fifteen years on from making his debut as a 13-year-old, Falcao reached the top by joining Manchester United
