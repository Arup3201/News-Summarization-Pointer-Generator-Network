A record-breaking grandmother with a love for sheep has amassed a collection of nearly 800 woolly wonders.

Michelle Sullivan shares her modest two bedroom home with 777 different types of sheep items after building up a mammoth flock over the last 17 years that includes teddies, ornaments, china and saucepans.

She started her collection in 1996 when a
friend brought her a Shaun the Sheep foot stall for Christmas and ever 
since then has been hooked on all things sheep related.

She's baa-rmy! Michelle Sullivan has amassed a collection of nearly 800 woolly wonders in the last 17 years

Now every wall and surface of her home in Erdington, Birmingham, is dominated by sheep.

Single mother Michelle, 42, said: 'If it is sheep related, I have probably got it. People think I am barmy. It is a great talking point. It is just mad.

'I am a big sheep lover. It started off with Shaun the Sheep after I saw the animated film A Close Shave and I just thought he was so cute.

'It is quite funny that someone in the middle of Birmingham in a two bedroom house can collect this many sheep.'

People all over the world have heard about Michelle's collection via Facebook and Twitter and as a result has had sheep sent to her from Australia, Canada, Spain and Turkey.

Where it all began: She started her collection in 1996 when a friend brought her a Shaun the Sheep footstall for Christmas and ever since then has been hooked on all things sheep related

In fact Michelle estimates that 60 per cent of her collection has been donated to her.

The only part of the house which is untouched by her flocks of sheep is her 24-year-old son's room Leigh.

'He thinks I'm crackers,' she said.

'Everybody knows me for my love of sheep - the little ones love it.'

Her favourite item from the collection is one of her earliest teddy bears as it has been loved by all her nieces and nephews, and more recently by her three-year-old grandson Liam.
