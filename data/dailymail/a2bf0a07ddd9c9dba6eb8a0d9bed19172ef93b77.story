The Bahamas may owe its origins to iron-rich dust blown over from the Sahara desert.

This dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate, the core building block of the Bahama Islands, a study has found.

Over the last 100 million years the carbonate has formed into the Great Bahama Bank, a 2.8 mile-thick (4.5 kilometre) platform located in the western Atlantic Ocean.

A satellite image of the Great Bahama Bank is shown on the left. On the right is the distribution of insoluble material in the sediments and collection sites re shown. The insoluble material (shown in red) is derived from atmospheric dust

Without this dust, the Bahamas wouldn’t exist, scientists say, and we would instead have a wide open ocean with a slight underwater bump on sonar.

Researchers from the University of Miami analysed concentrations of two trace elements characteristic of atmospheric dust – iron and manganese – from 270 seafloor samples from the Bahamas.

The team found that the highest concentrations of elements occurred to the west of Andros Island, an area which has the largest concentration of whitings.

The Sahara is the major source of mineral dust, which is blown by persistent winds across Africa's 3.5-million square mile desert.

This dust subsequently spreads across the Mediterranean, where it is the origin of rain dust.

These winds, which lift mineral-rich sand into the atmosphere, also travel the nearly 5,000 mile (8,000 km) north west journey towards the U.S. and Caribbean.

Here, the dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate, the core building block of the Bahama Islands.

Whitings are white sediment-laden bodies of water produced by cyanobacteria, which obtained their energy through photosynthesis.

'Cyanobacteria needs 10 times more iron than other photosynthesisers because they fix atmospheric nitrogen,' said Professor Swart, lead author of the study.

'This process draws down the carbon dioxide and induces the precipitation of calcium carbonate, thus causing the whiting.’

They claim the dust particles blown into the Bahamas' waters and directly onto the islands provide the nutrients necessary to fuel cyanobacteria blooms.

This is in turn, produce carbonate whitings in the surrounding waters.

The dust is blown by persistent winds across Africa's 3.5-million square mile Sahara Desert lifts mineral-rich sand into the atmosphere.

It then travels the nearly 5,000 mile (8,000km) northwest journey towards the U.S. and Caribbean.
