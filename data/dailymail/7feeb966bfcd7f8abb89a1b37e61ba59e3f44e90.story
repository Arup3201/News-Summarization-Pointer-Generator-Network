It was a momentous day celebrating 60 years since the Queen's Coronation. And today, the monarch, resplendent in a pale gold silk coat and dress with beautiful flower-trimmed hat, was dressed to befit the occasion.

Wearing a pale gold coat of a delicate silk brocade, she added a flash of colour at the lapel with an eye-wateringly large aquamarine brooch from the Brazil Parure collection of jewels.

Her hat was trimmed on the underside of the brim with a clutch of five silk chiffon blooms in a complementary pale blue tone.

National figures gathered at Westminster Abbey ahead of the Queen's 11am arrival for the service celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation.

It was a day to reflect and remember, with a thanksgiving service designed to echo the original Coronation service held within these same ancient walls on 2 June 1953.

Today the monarch marked the milestone with her family, 2,000 invited guests and the nation. 

The Duke of Edinburgh missed a royal engagement with the Queen on Monday night because he was feeling 'under the weather', but was well enough to attend the service today. 

The service has been divided into the Recognition, Anointing, Homage and Thanksgiving, reflecting parts of the original Coronation ceremony.

The majestic St Edward's Crown - with which the Queen was crowned - will rest on the High Altar - the first time the heavy, solid gold, jewel encrusted crown has left the Tower of London since the 1953 coronation.

The Ampulla, the gold, eagle shaped bottle from which the holy oil was poured for the anointing - the most sacred part of the coronation - also stood on the altar.

The Coronation chair from 1953 had been restored to its former glory for the occasion. 

Landmark: The Dean of the Abbey said this was to be a happy occasion, but the service was nevertheless a solemn affair

Solemn: The senior royals heard a speech by PM David Cameron and enjoyed music from some of the choristors who performed at the original Coronation

A flask of aromatic oil - taken from the same batch made for the Queen's coronation - was processed through the Abbey, carried by 11 representatives of the people of the United Kingdom to the Sacrarium, received by the Archbishop of Canterbury and placed by the Dean of Westminster on the High Altar.

Prime Minister David Cameron gave a reading, as will the Secretary General of the Commonwealth Kamalesh Sharma.

Actress Claire Skinner, who stars in the BBC sitcom Outnumbered, read a poem written for the anniversary by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. 

One of her favourites: The Queen wore a large aquamarine brooch from the Brazil Parure collection

The Brazil Parure collection, presented to the Queen in 1953 by the President and people of Brazil, is one of the most modern in the Queen's extensive collection.

The set consists of a necklace with nine large aquamarine stones - one of which is a pendant that the Queen had embellished with yet more diamonds and made detachable so that she could wear it as a brooch, as she chose to do today.

The large aquamarine stone, which the Queen has worn as a brooch on many occasions, is matched to a bracelet set with large aquamarines in the same tone.

It took over a year for jewellers of Brazil to collect enough stones of the correct size and hue to make the set.

It is said that the Queen adored the set so much that in 1957 she commissioned royal jewellers Garrard & Co to make her a tiara made to match with three vertically set oblong aquamarines.

As well as wearing the brooch as a separate piece - the Queen wore it on the lapel of a blue coat for Ascot recently - she frequently wears the entire set together, making for a dazzling display.

One memorable occasion was in 2006, when the Queen hosted the President of Brazil and his wife at a state banquet at Buckingham Palace - and honoured the President by wearing the spectacular jewels his country had bestowed upon her some 53 years earlier.
