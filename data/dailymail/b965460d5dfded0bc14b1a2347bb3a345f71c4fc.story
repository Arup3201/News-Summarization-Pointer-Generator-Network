A giant maze commemorating the First World War centenary has been unveiled .

The iconic Lord Kitchener call 'Your Country Needs You' poster has been carved into a 12-acre field in Cambridgeshire, which has one million maize plants and 3km of pathways.

The maze also features a giant 40-metre wide poppy created using more than 60,000 Flanders poppies, planted across an area of 1,300 square metres.

I need you... to get out of this maze: The giant Lord Kitchener has been carved into a field in Cambridgeshire to commemorate the First World War 

Lady Emma Kitchener, the great-great niece of Lord Kitchener, officially opened the maze at Skylark Garden Centre in Wimblington, near March.

She said: 'My great-great-uncle's image has been used many times to commemorate the First World War, but seldom, if ever, in such an imaginative and all-encompassing way. I could not be more delighted.'

Edward Gowler from Skylark Garden Centre who created the maize maze said: "We create a maize maze each year with a different design and this year wanted to play our part in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Great War.

'Alfred Leete's stylised depiction of Lord Kitchener lends itself perfectly to being cut out in a field of maize.'

With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener was made Secretary of State for War.

Patriotic: The iconic 1914 poster was drawn by Alfred Lette and urged young Britons to join the Allied forces 

The iconic recruitment poster 'Your Country Needs You' was drawn by Alfred Lette and first appeared in the London Opinion magazine in 1914.

The poster has become one of the most enduring and iconic images of the First World War and had been parodied many times.

Kitchener, whose head in the maze is 100 metres wide, died in 1916 when the ship he was travelling on hit a mine and sank.

The maize was planted in April and the pathways were cut in May. The plants will be harvested in October after the maze closes.

Visitors to the maize maze, which opens tomorrow, will have to navigate the pathways and find the ration stamps to put in their mess tins.
