The Queen was a breath of spring in cold mid-February in a pale floral suit at a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening.

Her majesty was hosting a bash in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who both recently turned 50, and the work they do to support a wide range of charities.  

375 guests attended the event from organisations including the National Youth Theatre, The Commonwealth Games Federation, The London College of Fashion, The Craft Guild of Chefs, The British Paralympic Association, MENCAP, the Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice and the Northern Ballet. 

The Queen hosted a party in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex and work they do to support a wide range of charities at Buckingham Palace this evening, which was attended by 375 guests. Before the event started, the Duke of York posted a picture of his mother, brother and sister-in-law in the Queen's private apartments onto Facebook

The Queen spent some quiet moments with close family members in her private apartments before they headed out to meet the guests.

Her second eldest son Prince Andrew, 54, captured the moment on his mobile phone and uploaded the photo to his Facebook page. 

The Duke of York captioned it: 'A family photo before we join the guests at my brother and sister-in-law's joint 50th Birthday Reception at Buckingham Palace, to recognise the important work with their many organisations - AY.'

Stars including Dame Esther Rantzen, Sheridan Smith and Matt Lucas rubbed shoulders with charity workers and members of the British Army at the event.

While the Queen dressed in an elegant cream dress and jacket, accessorised with black shoes, a black handbag and a pearl necklace, Sophie looked chic in all-black. 

The Countess wore a simple black dress with a pearl and diamante shoulder embellishment by Victoria Beckham, which she offset with a pair of diamond stud earrings.

Her hair was swept up in a loose chignon that framed her face. 

Prince Edward looked very smart in a dark blue suit, complete with pale blue pocket square and a brown polka dot tie.

The singer Sophie Ellis Bextor was also invited to the event

Dame Esther, 74, who was present because of her work with ChildLine and the NSPCC, even delayed her first meeting with her newborn grandchild to be there. 

She said: 'My second grandson was born at 7.30am and the reason that I am not at his bedside is because I am here. 

'My son (Dr Joshua Wilcox, the baby's father) has forgiven me.

'I was able to say to Edward that the name of my grandson is Edward. But unlike His Royal Highness, he will be known as Teddy. 

'He was a bounding 9lb 1oz and at dawn I get on the train to go to Torquay to admire him.'

Dame Esther, who has attended the palace on numerous occasions through her charity work, described the value of royal support to a charity as 'almost unquantifiable'.

She said: 'When people work every minute of every day with a commitment to a particular cause - admittedly they do it because they are dedicated. 

'But to be able to shake hands with a member of the royal family is in a way the nation saying thank you.' 

The guest list at the event reflected Edward's interest in the arts and sport, his military appointments and his links with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and International Award Foundation.

It also marked Sophie's work with charities that help families, young people and children tackling avoidable blindness. 

Staff, volunteers and charity representatives were also present from The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, Girlguiding, England Hockey, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness and the Association of Show and Agricultural Organisations.

Today isn't the first time that Prince Andrew has used social media in Buckingham Palace. In April 2014, he became the first member of the royal family to post a selfie on Twitter during his Pitch@Palace event for young entrepreneurs
