It's surprising Alexa Chung found any time to watch the catwalk shows in London today as she sported three different outfits over the course of several hours.

The 28-year-old model and TV presenter, who was announced as a spokesperson for the British Fashion Council this year, arrived for the 10am Lou Dalton show wearing a pale blue checked shirt, topped with a short pineapple embellished shift dress.

She then moved venues sidling up to D&G model David Gandy on Topshop's front row fashioning skinny jeans, a beige trench coat and black felt hat. And after lunch she slipped into a leather skirt gold pumps and jumper just in time to catch highlights from the Martine Rose runway.

Today marks day one of the London Collection: Men, a new three-day initiative celebrating British menswear, coordinated by a committee including GQ editor Dylan Jones, U.S. designer Tom Ford and Elton John’s partner David Furnish.

Benedict Cumberbatch is also due to model for Spencer Hart at their show this evening at the Old Selfridges Hotel. The actor regularly wears suits designed by the British luxury tailor,  most recently to the BAFTA TV awards and Golden Globes.

Spencer Hart has dressed some of the world’s best known actors and musicians, including Robbie Williams, Jay-Z, P Diddy, David Bowie, Alex Turner and Dominic West.

Speaking about the new initiative Harold Tillman, CBE Chairman of British Fashion Council said: 'The menswear industry has been growing from strength to strength in past years and this is true testament to this, London Collections:

'Men will not only be a showcase for brands and designers but will form a cross cultural programme creating a festival for Menswear in what will be a truly exciting year for the UK. I would like to thank Dylan Jones as Chair of the newly formed Fashion 2012 Menswear committee and all of the members, designers and brands involved in making this work.'

London Collections: Men will form part of the Fashion 2012 calendar, in a bid to showcase the best of British fashion.

Gordon Richardson, design director at Topman added: 'No longer shoe horned into one condensed hectic day, the newly established London Menswear Collections, over 3 glorious days now has the space to breathe, flourish and generate the buzz that will put its talented rising men's fashion stars firmly on the international fashion map.'
