The Xbox Kinect has proven to be extremely good at recognising the human body.

Only last week, a group of Japanese researchers used the sensor to create a device that can translate sign language.

Now one writer has discovered that Kinect can see human anatomy far better than first thought.

Perhaps, a bit too well.

Mr Wilson noted that the Kinect hardware/software was so effective at distinguishing the bumps and folds of clothing that it could pinpoint a man's package

‘I noticed, alongside the intricacies of a hoodie and jeans--and there’s no graceful way to put this--a dong,’ said Mark Wilson of Fastco Design.

Mr Wilson noted that the Kinect hardware/software was so effective at distinguishing the bumps and folds of clothing that it could pinpoint a man’s package.

He made the discovery while testing Microsoft's new and improved Kinect sensor which is due to come out on 22 November.

Microsoft unveiled its new Kinect sensor as part of its Xbox One event in June.

The sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 November.

It can read up to six skeletons at once, compared to the current two, and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.

The second-generation Kinect sensor is also able to see faces, track eye movements and detect expressions.

It is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what's called active infrared (IR).

IR works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night-vision goggles, for example.

As well as the heart rate monitor, Microsoft's sensor has an increased 'field of view' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current Kinect.

The filming in the above video was done on the Kinect’s topographical view, which is accessible to all gamers but not often used.

‘The new Kinect certainly isn’t malevolent; it’s just engineering that works a bit too well, and is sharing that a half step more socially than we might want it to be,’ said Mr Wilson.

Mr Wilson said that it raises the question of whether Xbox should be censoring some of its images.

‘I’ve learned one thing in 31 years of masculinity, it’s that nobody ever wants to see my placket-racket flopping around in the living room,’ he added.
