Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels

Italy is to outline proposals to fast-track African migrants and send them directly to EU countries including Britain.

Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels tomorrow.

Mr Alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on African soil, where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout European states.

The minister’s proposals come as the EU border chief warned that there are up to a million migrants in Libya preparing to cross the Mediterranean.

Italy, with its southernmost landfall just a 80km (49 miles) from Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in Europe.

With Libya descending into ever-worsening chaos and lawlessness, almost 9,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores in January and February, up 43 per cent on last year’s record figures.

Fabrice Leggeri director of EU border control Frontex said: ‘Our sources tell us there are anywhere between 500,000 to a million people ready to leave from Libya.’ ‘We have to be ready to address a more difficult situation than last year.’

With militias loyal to the Islamic State making frightening inroads in Libya, it is feared that jihadis could enter Europe by boat hidden among migrants.

Minister Alfano, of the centre-right NCD party, said the solution has to be found in Africa: ‘We must resolve the problem at its origin. There are two paths, stabilise Libya and create refugee camps in

Africa so that the screening is done there, and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the European countries.’

He told Italian television La 7 in advance of the meeting that Libya has become ‘an international priority.’

‘The camps would do a preventative screening,’ he said. ‘Who has refugee status would be distributed in a balanced way among various European countries, those who aren’t would not be given permission to leave.’

Italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in Europe. These migrants were rescued from the sea after the boat they were travelling in capsised

Three of the camps would be based in Niger, Tunisia and Sudan, according to Italian media reports.

Natasha Bertaud, spokesman for the EU executive, said the plans were in an ‘orientation phase’ .

She said the Commission was ‘aware that some member states are in discussions to develop centres in North

Africa and are in contact with the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR about the possibility of developing centres for migrants to facilitate screening and logistics for the voluntary return of economic migrants, as well as identifying those who need help.’

A pilot project in Niger is under discussion, she said. Deploying liaison officers in third party countries is ‘a long term project’ she said.

It is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from Libya. Pictured: A group of migrants arrived in Lampedusa few days ago, arrive in the harbour of Lampedusa to be transferred to Sicily

The proposals are likely to meet opposition in norther European states that may bear the brunt of a future quota system.

But the plans were welcomed in Italy.

Centre left PD Senator Luigi Manconi head of the Human Rights commission said: ‘I learn with satisfaction that minister Alfano will present tomorrow in Brussels a project for the opening with the UNHCR and the IOM of at least three migration centres which would allow them to process asylum requests for Europe.

‘The facilities would be created by the EU in conjunction with international humanitarian organisations to two ends: avoiding the illegal crossings of the Mediterranean with the risks that it brings and distributing the asylum seekers in Europe according to balanced reception quotas.’
