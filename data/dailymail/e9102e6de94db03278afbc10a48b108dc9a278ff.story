Power couple: Former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell with her tax lawyer husband David Mills

She separated from her husband after he was accused of taking a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi – but yesterday Dame Tessa Jowell admitted that the couple were reconciled.

The former Labour culture secretary and her wealthy tax lawyer husband David Mills parted in 2006. Although they never divorced, the former marital home in Kentish Town, north London, was sold.

Dame Tessa moved to a swish new home in Highgate while Mills remained in their country spread in Warwickshire.

Breaking her silence about her marital woes for the first time, Dame Tessa, 65, said that parting from Mills, her second husband, broke her heart.

And she robustly denied suggestions that she had ditched her marriage for the sake of her career in government.

In a radio interview she said: ‘What mother is prepared to look her children in the eye and say: “We are splitting up. But, you know what? It’s not real.”’

Her decision to speak out publicly about the split comes just days after she announced she was standing down from frontline politics with her departure from the shadow cabinet. She received a damehood in the Queen’s Birthday Honours.

An old friend of the Labour MP said: ‘It seems unlikely that the two events were not connected. I’m sure she wants to unburden herself now that she’s going to become more of a private citizen.’

Explaining the background to the split, when Mills found himself engulfed in Italian bribery allegations, Dame Tessa told Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘He reached the view that life was intolerable while we were together and, as he put it to me: “You’re my problem, I’m you’re problem” and we separated. It broke my heart.’

Of their new life, she said: ‘David has his house in the country and I have my house. We see each other regularly and we have time together which I really treasure as a family. We have reached a state of stability which I never thought possible.’

Controversial: Lawyer David Mills was accused of taking a bribe from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi

The couple have been spotted walking hand in hand near Mills’ country home.

Dame Tessa and Mills were often portrayed as the epitome of a successful New Labour couple. A
high-flying minister and a wealthy international lawyer, they shared 
successful careers and contacts at the highest levels, both in politics 
and business. They were close to Tony Blair.

But
following weeks of unwelcome media interest in Mills’ business links to
former Italian prime minister Berlusconi, the couple separated.

Mills was found guilty of accepting a £350,000 bribe in return for providing false testimony for Berlusconi in two corruption trials concerning the Italian’s time as a businessman. The conviction was later thrown out on a technicality.

In her interview Dame Tessa also 
re-affirmed her belief in Mills, who is now semi-retired and writing 
novels, saying: ‘My husband never took a bribe, never acted in any kind 
of corrupt way as subsequent judgments have made clear. He was 
effectively exonerated.’ 

When
challenged by presenter Jane Garvey that he had actually been heavily 
fined by the Italian courts, she replied: ‘The byzantine nature of 
Italian justice is something that is very hard to explain.'

Loving couple: Tessa Jowell admitted that separating from David Mills broke her heart

Dame
Tessa was one of the key figures in bringing the Olympic Games to 
London at the time her husband was protesting his innocence. She 
remained close to the project even after Labour lost the 2010 election.

While not subjected to the boos that 
greeted Chancellor George Osborne during the Paralympics, she was met by
groans from the crowd when she presented medals.

Describing why they separated she 
said: ‘We had three very difficult years before [the accusations] and 
three very difficult years after that.’

Last night Mills said: ‘I never comment on my private life but whatever Tessa has said is true.’

In
a statement in 2009 after her husband was found guilty of accepting the
bribe, Dame Tessa said: ‘This is a terrible blow to David and, although
we are separated, I have never doubted his innocence.’

She
was dragged into her husband’s controversial financial affairs in 2006 
when it emerged that she had signed papers for a loan secured on their 
London home – which was subsequently paid off with the help of the 
alleged bribe.

The 
couple announced their split days later after it emerged that Mills had 
used his wife’s Cabinet position and his friendship with Mr Blair to 
fight the corruption allegations in a letter to financial authorities in
Dubai.

She insisted that she did not know about the money until four years later.

An
inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell found that she should 
have declared the payment but Mr Blair, who was then still prime 
minister, cleared her of any wrongdoing.
