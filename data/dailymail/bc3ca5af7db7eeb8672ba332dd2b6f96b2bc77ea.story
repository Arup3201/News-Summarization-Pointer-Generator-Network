Bruce Guthrie, policy advisor for Graduate Careers Australia, said dentists have been the highest paid graduates in Australia for 30 years 

If you want to earn the highest wage when you finish university doing a degree in dentistry is the best way to do it, according to new statistics.

The research carried out by Graduate Careers Australia reveals that careers in the medical industry are the best paid. 

Graduate dentists can expect to earn up to $80,000 when finishing university and optometry graduates can fetch up to $70,000. 

Engineers can command around $64,000 while those working in medicine can get around $60,000 a year. 

Bruce Guthrie, policy advisor for Graduate Careers Australia told Daily Mail Australia: 'These statistics are not that surprising because dentistry has been the best paid graduate career in Australia for the last 30 years. 

'I have been doing these statistics since the 1980's and the big changes we have seen are the wages for science graduates increasing. 

'These are people who are affected by mining booms and their wages have improved notably over the years. 

'We track the salaries of people three years on and they can grow up to 60 per cent, the outlook can completely changes. 

'These figures are taken four months after they have finished their degree. 

'Since the GFC we have seen it taking graduates longer to find jobs and  a lot of them are taking non graduate level jobs. 

'Graduate numbers are small in the dentistry industry and it's a high paying field, dentists are very high earners and its supply and demand. 

'More experienced people in the field will get paid a lot more. 

Australian dentistry graduates command the best wages of $80,000 a year when they finish university 

This is the list of graduate pay compiled by Graduate Careers Australia showing the careers 

Mr Guthrie says the science professions have seen the biggest wage hikes in recent years in Australia 

'We always tell people that what you get paid is just a small part of the information you should take into consideration when doing a degree. 

'It's no use choosing a dentistry degree if your heart lies in English Literature, these figures are informative and they shouldn't play a huge role in people's selection of degrees. 

Sarah Macartney, a spokesman for Seek, told Daily Mail Australia that graduate pay was all about supply and demand and those with a skills shortage can command a higher salary.

'Roles that have spent a lot of time at university are naturally going to command higher salaries and that is true of the medical industry and for dentists, high remuneration comes with skills. 

Optometrists can earn $70,000 while engineers can command about $64,000

Pharmacists only start on around $38,000 after they finish university because they have to carry out another year of training 

'Sometimes there are misconceptions that say lawyers, people with professional skills, get paid a lot but it's not always the case, it takes a lot of hard work.' 

Dan Purchas, a director at Graduate Careers, told Daily Mail Australia, that careers in engineering and investment banking were also very highly paid. 

He said: 'We would generally say to graduates for the best pay to join a graduate programme. It can be good and graduates need to apply between February and April for the following year.

'Technology degrees are missing from the market at the moment, there are not enough of them and for the number of people who are looking for them. 

'Computer science degrees for example can see a starting wage of $65,000 and some of the bigger companies can offer higher starting brackets if they are more aggressive.'
