The U.S. and Israel are planning a massive military exercise in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to face down Iran over its sabre-rattling in the region.

But the Islamic Republic is also preparing war games in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic oil route which the country has threatened to block off in a move which could seriously restrict energy supplies.

Britain's Defence Secretary yesterday said that the UK would take military action to prevent Iran - which is believed to be developing secret nuclear weapons - from cutting off the strait.

Iran announced last night that an annual naval exercise known as 'The Great Prophet' would take place in the strait next month.

Admiral Ali Fadavi, naval commander of the country's Revolutionary Guards, said the drill would be 'different' to previous years, but did not specify how.

The move could clash with a plan by Israel’s military to gear up with U.S. forces in staging major missile defence exercises in the region.

The
 drills, called Austere Challenge 12, are designed to improve defence 
systems and co-operation between the forces and would be the largest 
ever held by the two countries.

Thousands
 of U.S. and Israeli soldiers will take part as they test multiple air 
defence systems against incoming missiles and rockets. 

Israel has deployed the Arrow system,
 jointly developed and funded with the U.S., which is designed to 
intercept Iranian missiles in the stratosphere, far from the country.

A
 statement from the Israeli military said: ‘U.S. European Command 
routinely works with partner nations to ensure their capacity to provide
 for their own security and, in the case of Israel, their qualitative 
military edge.’

Philip Hammond, the UK's Defence Secretary, warned the regime in Tehran that Britain will not tolerate the ‘very significant consequences’ if it fulfils a threat to block the Strait of Hormuz.

He signalled that such action would be blocked by force of arms.Mr Hammond used a speech in Washington to warn Iran that any move to close the key Gulf trade route would be opposed by the Royal Navy.

‘Any attempt by Iran to do this would be illegal and unsuccessful,’ he said in a speech at the Atlantic Council.

Then in a television interview, Mr 
Hammond said he wanted to send a ‘very clear message to Iran’ that the 
UK would not allow the Strait of Hormuz to be closed.

The Royal Navy operates mine clearance vessels in the Gulf as part of a joint taskforce based in Bahrain.

He said: ‘We are an integrated part 
of the naval taskforce in the Gulf and one of the missions of that 
taskforce is to ensure that those shipping lanes remain open.

'Any 
attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz would be illegal and we need to 
send a very clear message to Iran that we are determined that the Strait
 should remain open.’

More than 15million barrels of oil pass through the narrow stretch of water between Iran and the United Arab Emirates every day.

Iran has threatened to block the 34-mile wide strait in retaliation for a planned EU trade embargo on Iranian oil.

The planned embargo is an attempt to persuade Iran to abandon plans to develop a nuclear weapon.

Mr
 Hammond said: ‘Very clearly the Strait of Hormuz is one of the great 
commercial arteries of the world – it must remain open and flowing, or 
there would be very significant consequences for the economies of the 
region and indeed of the world.

'We’ve
 heard these kinds of threats from Iran before, but there should be no 
miscalculation by the Iranians about the importance that the 
international community attaches to keeping the Strait of Hormuz open.’

Mr Hammond was in Washington for his first meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Leon Panetta.

They held talks at the Pentagon yesterday on Afghanistan, Iran and other military matters.

In his speech, Mr Hammond also pointed to the economic crisis as the most serious threat to national and international security.

He spoke out as President Obama yesterday rolled out a new defence strategy that will shrink the U.S. armed forces, but pledged to maintain the country’s position as the world’s dominant military power.

He has already earmarked budget cuts of $489billion (£315billion) over ten years as the pace of spending slows more than a decade after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Mr Hammond said countries would have to work together more to reduce the ‘astronomical’ costs of modern warfare.

‘Without strong economies and stable public finances it is impossible to build and sustain, in the long-term, the military capability required to project power and maintain defence,’ he said.

‘That is why today the debt crisis should be considered the greatest strategic threat to the future security of our nations.’

Last month, the head of the British armed forces said the biggest strategic risk facing the UK was economic rather than military.

General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said ‘no country can defend itself if bankrupt’.
