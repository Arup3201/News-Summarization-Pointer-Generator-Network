It is often hailed as an indulgence or a pick-me-up for many people but chocolate proved to be an important necessity during the First World War.

For the brave men in the trenches the confectionary gave soldiers a taste of home, boosting morale while away from friends and family.

To mark its significance a unique exhibition has been unwrapped at York’s Chocolate Story, North Yorkshire, where visitors will be able to see previously unseen artefacts, footage, photographs and letters.

A chocolate box sent from the Lord Mayor of York to all soldiers on the front line for Christmas 1914 features in the exhibition at York's Chocolate Story in York

A letter from Dr H. Moore is among those to the Lord Mayor in thanks for the box of chocolates sent to all York soldiers fighting the First World War. He writes he will 'treasure the box' for as long as he lives and also tells how he was wounded in the early days of the war in the retreat from Mons and was blinded in his left eye

The artefacts featured in the exhibition entitled ‘WWI: A Taste of Home’, which also commemorates the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, include a set of military chocolate tins with one of the very few remaining Lord Mayor’s chocolate tins issued to all citizens of York in active service at Christmas 1914.

This gesture, on behalf of the city’s population, started ‘Chocolate Letters’, which is a series of over 250 thank you letters penned by York servicemen in training, in trenches, in prisoner of war camps and at sea.

One of the letter’s, from soldier Gunner Henry Bailey from Holgate, York, dated January 11, 1915, said: ‘I feel that I ought to send my very best thanks for the nice box of chocolate I received so unexpectedly.

‘I am proud to be able to say that I am a York lad and am looking forward to a speedy termination of this Cruel War. I shall prize the box as long as God spares me.’

A chocolate box sent to all soldiers in the war was used by its owner to store bullet shells and shards, as well as a sketch of a Mill's grenade after eating the chocolate

These letters speak of humour, pride and even fear, offering a poignant insight into how chocolate functioned as a symbol of a life they had left behind.

‘Throughout history cocoa has proved a valuable resource in times of war, dating back to the warrior Aztecs who drank bitter cocoa to gain strength and energy,” said a spokesperson for the venue.

‘Visitors can explore how the gift of chocolate helped to keep wartime spirits high, both at home and on the frontline, investigate how the city’s famous Quaker chocolate companies offered their support to the war effort and how chocolate manufacturing changed forever after 1918.’

Visitors will also be able to listen to never before exhibited voice recordings, which details the background and experiences of York servicemen who survived the war as well as precious film footage of the Yorkshire regiments.

The exhibition will run until December 31.
