Arrest: Edward Clinton Jones, 41, allegedly offered an undercover cop money to kill his wife

A former firefighter offered an undercover police officer $8,000 to kill his wife because he feared she was going to leave him and take their four children away, police have said.

Edward Clinton Jones, who left his job in Charleston, South Carolina after a huge fire claimed nine of his colleagues, was arrested on Tuesday and appeared via video in court on Wednesday.

His wife, Michelle Jones, sobbed and begged the judge to keep her husband, 41, away from her and their children.

'He has no remorse, and he needs to stay 
behind bars. I beg of you not to let him out,' she told the judge, ABC News reported. 'I'm afraid for my life.'

But
 one of his daughters, 18-year-old April Jones, screamed in the 
courtroom: 'That's my mom asking for no contact! I want contact with my 
father! I love you dad!'

He 
was arrested after a witness contacted police on Monday, claiming Jones 
asked him about hiring a hitman to kill his wife, who was planning to 
move to Delaware with the kids, according to an affidavit.

Jones
 offered $8,000 from insurance money to an undercover police officer to 
carry out the killing, providing him with a photograph and work address 
for his wife, the court documents said.

'Plot': Jones, pictured with his wife Michelle and one of their daughters, April, allegedly told the undercover police officer to 'finish her off' as he didn't want to have to visit her in the hospital

He allegedly told the cop to 'finish off' his wife because he did not want to visit her in hospital.

He was arrested and charged with solicitation to commit murder.

Jones, sitting in a wheelchair, appeared at the bond hearing via video from the jailhouse.

'I don't know why I even talked about such a thing,' he said. 'It's not me. I've never hurt anybody in my life. I've done nothing but help people.'

But his wife had no sympathy.

Remorse: Jones, who worked as a firefighter for 19 years, said he did not know what overcame him

'This cannot be blamed on medication,' she said through tears. 'This was a sick plan, thought out, to take my life. To leave our kids 
with no mother.'

Jones, who is on disability after working for the fire department for 19 years, has suffered from depression since a massive fire at a sofa store killed nine other firefighters on June 18, 2007.

He was off duty at the time of the blaze but ran to assist his overwhelmed colleagues, and he helped carry their burned bodies from the debris.

Jones, who said he suffered physical and emotional injuries in the fire, took early retirement after panic attacks and anxiety left him unable to work. He was also forced to give up his successful plumbing business, which had helped him support his family.

Life changing: He has suffered from depression since losing 9 of his colleagues to a fire in 2007

Inferno: He carried the burned bodies of his fellow firefighters from the burning sofa shop after discarded cigarettes started the blaze. He is on disability and is suing the store for its allegedly unsafe practices

'That night changed a lot of us,' Jones told the Post and Courier in 2009. 'The only thing I've ever known is firefighting, and now I can't 
even stand to hear the sound of a siren.'

Jones, who was one of six firefighters to be granted disability following the fire, settled a workers' compensation case against the city of Charleston, getting $108,000.

After the blaze, he filed a lawsuit against Sofa Super Store over the fire, blaming the store's owners for allegedly installing flammable roofing and ceiling products with safety systems like sprinklers.

It is believed the fire was started by unattended cigarettes in a loading dock and fire experts concluded that inadequate training, outdated tactics and old equipment contributed to the death, the Post and Courier reported.
