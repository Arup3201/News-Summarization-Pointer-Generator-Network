Chancellor George Osborne today backed the Archbishop of Canterbury in his bid to take on pay day loan firms like Wonga.

The Most Rev Justin Welby vowed to help grow Britain's 500 financial co-operatives, who lend at nowhere near the astronomical 5,853 per cent rate offered by the controversial payday lender.

The Archbishop said that it is his dream to 'compete' Wonga out of existence, and has even met its boss Errol Damelin to warn him.

'I've met the head of Wonga and we had a very good conversation and I said to him quite bluntly "we're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we're trying to compete you out of existence",' he told Total Politics magazine.

'He's a businessman, he took that well.'

Chancellor Mr Osborne signaled his support for the move, saying he was 'all in favour of credit unions and all sorts of other channels whereby families can get credit'.

He told BBC News: 'What is absolutely crucial is ... whoever is lending the money is doing so responsibly, making sure the people can repay, and I want to see as many options for families as possible.

'I don’t want them to face just one or two options, I want families to be able to have their needs serviced by a whole range of different providers.'

The Archbishop's intervention come after he launched a new credit union for clergy and church staff earlier this month at the General Synod in York.

Mr Welby, who has served on the parliamentary Banking Standards Commission, has said he plans to expand the reach of credit unions as part of a long-term campaign to boost competition in the banking sector.

There are also plans to encourage church members with relevant skills to volunteer at credit unions. Small, local lenders could also be invited to use church buildings and other community locations with the help of church members.

Newcastle United sponsor Wonga was in the news last week after Muslim footballer Papiss Cisse refused to wear the club's shirt with its logo on it.

The Senegalese striker, who is estimated to earn in the region of £40,000 a week, trained on his own on his return from his summer break after refusing to wear the branded training kit, as well as the match day shirt, because it is against his religious beliefs.

The Government announced an investment of £38million in credit unions in April to help them offer an alternative option to payday lenders.

The entire pay day lending industry, worth £2billion, was referred last month for a full-blown investigation by the Competition Commission after the trading watchdog uncovered 'deep-rooted' problems with the industry.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it decided to make the referral because it continues to suspect that features of the market 'prevent, restrict or distort competition'.

Wonga said in March that it welcomed any attempt to encourage responsible lending and that it has been 'instrumental' in helping to raise industry standards.

Mr Damelin, founder of Wonga, said: 'The Archbishop is clearly an exceptional individual and someone who understands the power of innovation.

'We discussed the future of banking and financial services, as well as our emerging digital society.

'There is mutual respect, some differing opinions and a meeting of minds on many big issues.

'On the competition point, we always welcome fresh approaches that give people a fuller set of alternatives to solve their financial challenges. I'm all for better consumer choice.'
