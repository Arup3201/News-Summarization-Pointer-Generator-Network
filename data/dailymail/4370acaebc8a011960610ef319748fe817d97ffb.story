Completing the perfect three-point turn can be tricky at the best of times, so spare a thought for this man who is forced to pull the manoeuvre on a narrow road halfway up a mountain.

Not only does the Austrian driver, Joachim Held, 43, have to complete the turn at dizzying heights, he also has to do it while hauling 200-tonnes of wood.

Amazingly he does this twice a day, every day, and has never made a mistake - so far.

Joachim Held, 43, has been filed completing a dangerous three-point-turn in the Austrian mountains

The manoeuvre begins with Held at the left of the shot, ready to reverse. Amazingly he completes the turn twice a day, every day

The logger gingerly backs towards the cliff edge, swinging the empty rear trailer out and over the ledge

Burly Joachim, who began driving trucks aged just 19, has to do the perilous turn in the mountains of Eisenerz, near Styria. He said: 'I have done this so many years that it's second nature now.

However, he added: 'I can understand why people find it scary.'

In the pictures he can be seen backing his truck towards the cliff edge, and even allowing the back part of the trailer to hang part-way off the mountain while he completes the turn.Â 

Held, who began driving trucks at 18, says he has never had a problem, but can see why it might scare people

Halfway through the turn the rear carraige can be seen dangling as Held swings the front end around

Moving very carefully, the logger then swings the front part of the lorry around to face towards the right hand side of the picture, before pulling away.

The images are reminiscent of the infamous Yungas Road in Bolivia, dubbed the world's most dangerous because of it's narrow, crumbling track which cars can barely pass on side by side.

It is thought that between 200 and 300 travellers are killed crossing it every year, and the path is marked with crosses where vehicles have fallen.

Easy does it: After some delicate positioning Held is pointing in the right direction and ready to drive away

And he's off: Held has survived this time, but will have to complete the turn again later
