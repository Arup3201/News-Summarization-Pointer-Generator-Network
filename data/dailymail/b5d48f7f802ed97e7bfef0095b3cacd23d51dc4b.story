The bunk-bed and the sofa-bed employed the same rationale and are now a firm fixture in any average urban home. 

Now a designer has come up with another way to reduce the amount of furniture you need in your flat - by turning a rug and a table into one piece of furniture.

Alessandro Isola was inspired to create the multi-purpose furnishing after becoming increasingly annoyed whenever he tripped over creases in the rug on his living room floor.

Multi-functional: A designer has come up with a way to reduce the amount of furniture needed in your home - by designing a rug which can also be used as a table

Double act: The piece of furniture can be used as a rug on the floor, but can be curved into various different shapes to double-up as a rug or even a shelf

Alessandro Isola said he wanted to 'enhance the folds and curves' of a rug in his project 'Stumble Upon'

The Italian designer decided he wanted to put that annoyance to good use and 'enhance the folds and curves' which often appear in flooring.

That's when he came up with this dual-purpose rug, which he calls 'Stumble Upon'.

To the naked eye, the piece of furniture appears to be a stylish rug.

But when one corner is overturned, a smooth, shiny
 surface is revealed - which doubles up as a 'functional table area'.

It means you can be comfortably walking on the rug one minute - but can then be using it for your Sunday roast the next.

On his website, Mr Isola, who studied at the Oxford School of Architecture, said: 'Enter a room and immediately you feel the evidence of an occupant.

'Either they're in the room with you, or you feel the atmosphere of an event that has since occurred.

'If you look down you may see a crease, a fold or a wrinkle in the carpet for instance, signifying a movement or activity that happened on the surface of that very floor space.

'This usually causes a slight annoyance 
and is firmly pulled straight.

'Stumble Upon enhances those folds and 
curves creating flexibility and contrast.

'The fold or the flick of the corner edge
 momentarily reveals its craftsmanship. Its quality is usually measured 
by how well it is finished underneath.

The shows six different ways in which the mullti-purpose rug can be folded, in order for it to be used in other ways

The designer was inspired to come up with the idea because of the number of times he tripped over a creased rug. He said he wanted to put the creases to good use

The item has a carpet-style top with a smooth, metallic-looking underside, to differentiate between the table and the rug

'This thought has been accentuated and the fold of a corner has been exaggerated to produce a dual surface.

'Stumble Upon acts as a functional table area, accented with a contrasting material.

'The fold means it can be configured and tessellate into multi-functional surfaces that suit the moment.'
