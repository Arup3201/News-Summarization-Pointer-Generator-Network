England's Ian Poulter suffered an injury scare on the eve of the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.

The Ryder 
Cup star underwent an MRI scan on a wrist injury sustained during last 
week's Scottish Open in Aberdeen, at which he missed the cut.

Concern: Ian Poulter had a scan on wrist injury after practice round at Hoylake on Monday

He expects to receive the results on Tuesday but has said there is no evidence of a fracture.

On Monday evening Poulter wrote on Twitter: 'Just off to Leeds to have a MRI scan on the wrist. Jarred it last week on 14th and 18th. Precautionary but has to be done.'

Target: Poulter believes that The Open and The Masters represents his best chance of winning a major

He followed that message with an update which said: 'Just had the MRI. Wait until tomorrow to get the results.

'No fractures that I do know. Radiologist will let me know. Fingers crossed.'

Poulter also suffered an injury scare ahead of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May.

On that 
occasion he injured his back in the gym and rated his chances of being 
fit as low as 10 per cent on the morning of the day before play was due 
to get under way.

He recovered to play all four rounds, though, eventually finishing in a tie for 26th place.
