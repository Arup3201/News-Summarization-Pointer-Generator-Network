When Rena Nathanson invented Bananagrams, the struggling single mother could not have dreamed how fruitful it would become.

The word game is Amazon UK’s bestselling toy of all time, and more than six million have been sold worldwide.

The business began in a kitchen in East Sheen, West London, after Miss Nathanson came up with the game to entertain her two young children after her 15-year marriage ended.

Mumpreneur: Rena Nathanson, 51, created Bananagrams in her kitchen and now the £14.99 game has sold over six million worldwide

The 51-year-old and her father, Abe, 
invented a game in which players race to make word grids out of letter 
tiles. It comes in a banana-shaped pouch and is similar to Scrabble, but
 without a board.

Seven years on, American-born Miss Nathanson lives in the same three-bedroom home with children Ava, now 15, and Aaron, 18.

She said: ‘It started out as a bit of fun. But the first 50 sold out immediately, so we had 500 made.

‘After
 that I carried on distributing from my kitchen. Everything in the shed 
had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. I drove my 
kids mad.

'It
 was sort of make or break. I was either going to move to America and 
get a job there or make it work here. I had to make something happen.

‘I started selling to independent toy shops in the UK and Ireland, and in 2008 Bananagrams was picked up by Amazon.

‘This year it was the top seller of all time. I’m pretty proud of that.’

Success: Today it is Amazon UK's top selling game of all time and it has turned creator Rena from a struggling single mother-of-two into a millionaire

Family: American-born Rena lives in London with her two children Ava, 15, and Aaron, 18

Overnight success: The game she invented for a bit of fun with the family has proved to be more fruitful than she could have imagined

The
 former graphic designer, who starts her day at 7.30 to take Ava to 
school and often works into the early hours, said: ‘Bananagrams has 
given me financial stability and that’s how it has changed my life.

‘For the first time in forever I can say I have a grown-up car where  the windows actually go up and down by themselves.’

Amazon
 UK named the £14.99 game its bestselling toy of all time on its 15th 
anniversary, and it is rumoured that the cast of Downton Abbey play 
during filming.

Miss Nathanson said: ‘I think it’s awesome. I love Downton Abbey. It’s the best compliment.’

The
 mother started her enterprise from the kitchen of her home in East 
Sheen and still fits school runs, cooking and cleaning around hectic 
business meetings and work calls.

Now
 the Bananagrams range has sold six million across 31 countries and is 
available in the UK at John Lewis, WHSmith, Waterstones, Tesco, 
Sainsburys and Waitrose.

It is even rumored that the cast of Downton Abbey play Bananagrams during filming.

The American-born entrepreneur said: 'The cast of Downton are huge fans, it's very exciting that they have it on set.

'One of the cast members got it and brought it on set and it became a craze. I think it's awesome. I love Downton Abbey. It's the best compliment.'

Rena first came up with the idea for the game with her late father, Abe, when her children were still young.

The aim is to race against other players to build crossword grids out of letter tiles.

It was such a hit with family and friends that Rena and Abe decided to make 50 prototypes to sell - and they were an instant success.

Gone bananas! Rena said everything in the shed had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. 'I drove my kids mad,' she laughed (pictured: A collect photo of Aaron at home)

Working mother: Rena starts her day at 7:30am to take Ava to school, and works tirelessly until the early hours as she liaises with her team of 25 in the US

She said: 'It started out as a bit of fun - nothing serious, just a game. But the first 50 sold out immediately so we had 500 made.

'I then had 5,000 games made for the London Toy Fair in 2006 - we were inundated with orders.

'After that I carried on selling in the UK distributing from my kitchen. Everything in the shed had to be moved and the house was taken over by Bananagrams. I drove my kids mad.

'I started selling to independent toy shops in the UK and Ireland and in 2008 Banangrams was picked up by Amazon.

'We've been selling strongly on there for years now but this year it was the top seller of all time. I'm pretty proud of that.'

Where it all began: It started out as a bit of fun with the family but the first 50 they produced sold out immediately so Rena and her late father (centre) had 500 made

Home: Rena, pictured with her children at home where she works from, said: 'It is a bit of a double-edged sword: it's great because I'm always around for the children but I can't get away from work'

Rena starts her day at 7:30am to take Ava to school, and works tirelessly until the early hours as she liaises with her team of 25 in the US.

She said: 'It is a bit of a double-edged sword. It's great because I'm always around for the children but I can't get away from work.

'I can keep overheads down but also take the kids to school and I'm still there for them - although I get constant interruptions.

'I say to them, if the door is closed pretend I'm not in the building!'.

Before starting Bananagrams, Rena had jobs in graphic design, and once managed an art gallery, but raising two children on one wage was a struggle.

Now, despite making her fortune, she isn't flash with her cash, and still lives in the same three-bedroom house.

Bright spark: Rena first came up with the idea for the game with her late father, Abe, pictured second from left, when her children were still young

She said: 'I live in the same house I moved into before I gave birth to my son 18 years ago and I love my family home.

'Bananagrams has given me financial stability and that's how it has changed my life. I can pay my bills.

'For the first time in forever I can say I have a grown-up car where the windows actually go up and down by themselves.'

Her hard work and tireless efforts have allowed Rena to provide a better life for her children and both Ava and Aaron were moved into private schools. Rena is also happy to be able to support a number of different cancer charities in memory of her late father.

Comfortable: Rena, who used to shop in bargain basements, says she loves not having to worry about money

Players: To this day, Rena, Ava and Aaron are still big fans of Bananagrams

And instead of counting the pennies, Rena is now able to splash out on holidays with her friends and thinks nothing of flying back and forth between the UK and her native America.

She said: 'I used to look for bargains and two-for-ones in the supermarket and now I just go and get what I like and it's a big difference.'

But despite her success, Rena is careful with her newfound wealth.

She said: 'I'm not stupid or careless but it's nice to not have to worry about it. Even shopping for clothes and things like that, I don't have to give it much thought now.'

To this day, Rena, Ava and Aaron are still big fans of Bananagrams.

Rena said: 'We all still play it, especially in America with my mum and other family. It really has been a huge source of fun for us all.'
