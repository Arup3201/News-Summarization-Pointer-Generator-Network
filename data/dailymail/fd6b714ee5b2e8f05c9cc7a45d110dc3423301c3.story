Yet more doubts have been raised over the authenticity of 'reality television' show Breaking Amish after one character revealed she has been divorced, which is rarely allowed in the Amish community.

Cast member Rebecca accepts a proposal from Abe on the TLC show, which depicts the two meeting in New York for the 'first time' - yet they are believed to already have a child together in real life.

It has now been claimed that, despite the 'revelation' on the show, Rebecca left her first husband, Rufus Hostetler, to start a relationship with Abe in 2010.

The claims spark yet more trouble for Breaking Amish, which has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving viewers since its launch more than a month ago.

TLC says the show follows five Amish and Mennonite men and women as they leave their communities for the first time and head to New York City - yet this story has slowly crumbled.

'Honesty': Breaking Amish cast member Rebecca, right, tells her fiance Abe, left, that she is divorced

Secret: But in reality, the couple are believed to have been together for two years and have a child

While each cast member claims to have
 grown up in the strict communities, evidence has surfaced suggesting 
they have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, arrests, children 
and domestic abuse.

It 
comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show, 
who stare slack-jawed at Manhattan's towering buildings and pray as they
 travel by plane 'for the first time'.

Among the characters, Rebecca and 
Abe are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a 
possible love match on the cards.

But, after the show depicts the pair 
getting closer and Abe proposing to Rebecca, she reveals she has been 
divorced - to his apparent shock.

'I have to make a decision between you and, like, being Amish,' he says on the show.

But a photograph uploaded to a Facebook page,  Breaking Amish the Truth, apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together.

Reports and
 marriage records reveal that Rebecca married Rufus Hostetler in March 
2010 before divorcing him this past summer, although their relationship 
apparently broke down much earlier.

In
 a message on Hostetler's Facebook wall in October 2010, he writes: 'I 
am tryn 2 figure out why in th world abe schmucker wud want to b a 
friend on face book afterall he left wht my wife.'

And
 while Abe claims in the program that he has never partied, police 
records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol 
intoxication in a public place in 2008, when he was just 18.

In perhaps the most shocking revelation about the real lives of the characters, Jeremiah, another cast member, is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her.

Public records reveal that 32-year-old Jeremiah Raber, who regularly swears on the show, has three children -  two daughters, aged seven and three, and a son, five.

The children live with their mother, Naomi Stutzman, 
in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, 
citing gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and incompatibility.

Speaking to CBS21, Stutzman, who has also left the Amish community, called the show 'a fake' and lambasted TLC for perpetuating lies on a family channel about a man accused of repeatedly attacking his wife.

'The kids and I suffered for years at the hands of this man,' she said.

'My family is livid because they took 
him in and cared for him, now he is doing this? I'm not surprised at 
him. What surprised me was TLC. My kids and I watch TLC. They are 
supposed to be a family channel. For them to do this is appalling.'

Police reports showed she called authorities on at least eight occasions and Jeremiah was arrested for domestic violence in 2005. She said that his violence eventually led to their break up.

On one occasion, he punched her in 
the stomach while she was pregnant, a police report notes. She said that
 TLC offered her $10,00 to stay quiet on the incidents, which TLC 
denies.

She added that,
 while Jeremiah is shown getting a large arm tattoo in Breaking Amish, 
he has in fact had it for years - and it bears the names of his three 
children.

Jeremiah was also reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans.

Daniel Gingerich, who claims he lived with Jeremiah for a year and a half, added: 'I've known him for years. I let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go.'

And the other cast members apparently were holding back some information, too.

TLC has previously admitted that 
Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, 
has been arrested for a DUI, but now new information paints an even more
 rebellious picture.

As revealed on a Facebook page,, she
 has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds
 with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent 
'vanity' which they deem a sin.

Online records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her Amish life to move to the city.

This internet savvy version of Kate is a far cry from an episode of Breaking Amish in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator.

The final character, Sabrina, a 25-year-old
 from an Italian and Puerto Rico family who was adopted into the faith, 
is pictured on Facebook kissing a man while she wears skimpy clothing.

She
 was reportedly married in 2009 and has not been a practicing Mennonite 
for years, friends claim, suggesting this is not the 'first time' she 
has left the community.

She is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally Mennonite.

The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger.

Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives.

Mose Gingerich, a former Amish who appeared on a separate show, Amish in the City, lambasted the show for its dishonesty.

'This
 show is doing exactly opposite of what I stand for,' he wrote on his 
blog. 'The fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the 
community, when in fact, they have been out for many years.

'The
 fact that they act like things like microwaves and iPhones are 
something strange, when indeed, they have owned them for years 
themselves, and the disrespect they show towards the Amish.

'I would never stoop to doing a show like this, and really wish no one else would have done it either.'

In response to the outrage, TLC has said it will address the revelations in time.

'There is a lot of information 
floating around about the group featured on Breaking Amish. Much of it 
is not true, but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes,'
 TLC told Variety.

'Our Amish and Mennonite producers that we hired introduced us to 
Amish and Mennonite men and women who were already determined to leave. They had already made the decision to go out and see
 the world, with or without us. They courageously allowed us to follow 
them on this journey.'

Despite these protestations, TLC has adjusted the description of the show on its website.

It was previously billed as 'four 
Amish and one Mennonite, breaking away from their faith and traveling to
 New York City for the first time'.

Now the TLC site explains: 'Breaking Amish offers an unprecedented look into a rarely seen world, following four Amish people and one Mennonite as they forgo horses and buggies for New York City's taxis and subways' - taking out any reference to 'first time' in New York City.
