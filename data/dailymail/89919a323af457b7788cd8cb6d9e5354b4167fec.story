A top banker has claimed Australians have an ‘irrational’ obsession with property investment as the latest data shows house prices only increased one per cent over October.

The chief executive of the Australian arm of ANZ Bank, Phil Chronican, has warned that too many people are pinning their hopes on property investment as a way to cash in.

‘I think there is a bit of an irrational obsession with housing as an investment class. For many investors, they would be better off in assets other than housing,’ Mr Chronican told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

This three bedroom house in Milperra, Sydney, costs over $650,000. The median dwelling price for Sydney is now $680,000.

He said a tax distortion in housing could be the reason that property investment is booming and he suggested people aren’t necessarily aware of the disadvantages – such as the high cost of stamp duty – that come with investing.

‘From a community awareness viewpoint, I think there should be more debate around the strengths and weaknesses of housing as an investment class,’ Mr Chronican said.

Mr Chronican has been a banker for more than 30 years but has also run a business with $209 billion of home loans connected to it, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

He earned $3,781,356 in 2013, thanks to his $1,191,978 salary and other compensations and bonuses, according to his executive profile on Business Week. 

The New Zealander was previously at Westpac Banking Corporation with roles in retail banking, capital markets, treasury, economics and strategy, including chief financial officer and head of institutional banking

In Melbourne, the average house price is $649,000. This two bedroom property in North Melbourne sold for $650,000 at the weekend

Treasurer Joe Hockey this month ordered a  financial system inquiry which revealed the huge amount of home loan debt in recent decades is a potential ‘systematic risk’ to the economy.

However, Mr Chronican’s comments about Australians being obsessed with property investment may be out of kilter with reality.

In March this year it was revealed less than 6 per cent of Australians, or roughly 1.3 million people, actually own an investment property.

He previously took aim at the negative gearing used by millions of property owners in 2011.

He claimed the tax break was leading to an unhealthy focus on housing as a way to get loaded, while pushing property prices to unaffordable levels, Domain reported.  

This four bedroom home in Hobart, comes at a cost of $340,000 - $365,000. The Tasmanian capital is now Australia’s most affordable city with a median dwelling price of $315,000

His latest comments come as the RP Data figures highlight that despite a slowdown in growth in September, property values continued to rise overall, increasing by 2.2 per cent over the past three months.

But although combined capital city home values were up by one per cent over October, only Sydney (1.3%), Melbourne (1.9%) and Brisbane (0.6%) actually recorded value rises over the month.

Meanwhile, the best performing city over the three months to October was Sydney, with an overall 3.9 per cent growth.

The rise has made the NSW capital the most expensive place to live in Australia, with a median dwelling price of $680,000.

The weakest performing state capital was Hobart, with -2.8 per cent growth.

The Tasmanian capital is now Australia’s most affordable city with a median dwelling price of $315,000.
