Mummy tummy: The Duchess of Cambridge leaving hospital on Monday

A senior minister has attacked the ‘disgraceful focus’ on the Duchess of Cambridge’s figure following the birth of Prince George.

Jo Swinson, minister for women and equalities, said yesterday that observers were expecting Kate to meet ‘impossible standards’ to reduce her weight.

She was reacting after OK! Magazine’s front cover promoted the Duchess’s supposed post-natal weight-loss regime soon after she left hospital. Other publications have followed suit.

Kate was much lauded by organisations such as Mumsnet for showing off her ‘mummy tummy’ on Tuesday in a designer dress as she posed with day-old baby George for the first time.

Miss Swinson, who is also expecting her first child, said discussion of Kate’s weight ‘shows just how extreme society’s obsession with women’s bodies looking “perfect” has become’.

The Liberal Democrat minister said it was wrong to believe that Kate and other women who have just given birth were ‘failing’ if they did not work instantly to regain their pre-pregnancy figure.

‘Publications like OK! Magazine need to get some perspective,’ she said. ‘Fitting back into pre-pregnancy jeans is not the priority after childbirth.’

Miss Swinson, who has led a campaign in Parliament to help women and girls improve their body image, warned that most women who have just given birth feel under huge pressure to regain their figures.

‘We need to move away from the idea that women have to shed their baby weight quickly and that they’re failing somehow if they don’t. Surveys show this is a concern for two-thirds of new mothers,’ she said.

Kensington Palace declined to comment on the furore but a family friend described it as ‘distasteful’. ‘She was very fit and healthy before falling pregnant and I am sure she will snap back naturally but that just isn’t her priority at the moment,’ said the friend.

Kate, they said, was enjoying ‘nesting’ at her parents’ home in Berkshire with William and George.

‘They just want some quiet time getting to know each other as a family and learning how this parents thing works,’ the source said.

The friend also revealed that Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, was ‘quietly rather worried’ about having a new baby in the house.

Immediate pressure: Magazines have already started discussing the Duchess' post-natal weight-loss only a week after she gave birth

‘It has obviously been a few years since she has had to do any of this,’ said the source.

‘Like any grandparent she has been terrified at the thought of dropping him on his head.

‘Fortunately she says it has all come flooding back.’

William and Kate have eschewed the services of a maternity nurse or nanny, but they have been accompanied by their housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, who will run errands and prepare meals.

While Kensington Palace will remain the Cambridges’ main residence, they are already preparing to move into their new country bolthole.

It is understood the Queen has paid the tenant of Anmer Hall in Norfolk a ‘generous’ settlement to vacate the property as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up.

The ten-bedroom Georgian property is situated on the monarch’s Sandringham Estate and is only two miles from Sandringham House, one of her favourite residences.

The Queen is currently on her annual summer holiday in the Highlands and her new great-grandson was mentioned in prayers for the first time when the monarch attended Crathie Kirk near Balmoral Castle yesterday.

All senior members of the Royal Family are named in the congregation’s prayers each week.

Prince George should not grow up to be king of Scotland, says the chairman of the campaign for Scottish independence. Dennis Canavan, of Yes Scotland, said an independent nation should be given a vote to decide whether it wanted to retain the monarchy or elect a head of state. ‘Personally, I favour the latter,’ he said.
