A cyclist has captured images of driver apparently using his mobile phone, laptop and headphones while behind the wheel of his Land Rover.

The video was shot in Aberdeen's Queen's Road last week and was uploaded to YouTube by an anonymous poster known only as Cycle Cam.

The motorist's actions have been condemned by road safety campaigners and the driver now faces a potential questioning by police.

A cyclist using a head-mounted camera caught this image of a driver apparently using his mobile phone, laptop whilst driving with headphones over both ears

The pictures, shot from the head-mounted camera, captured the driver looking down at his phone as he cruised past the cycle lane on February 5.

In the description accompanying the video, the cyclist wrote: 'This bloke is driving a three tonne Land Rover in town, looking at a mobile phone, laptop and wearing headphones on both ears.

'Not only he's not paying any attention to the road, I suspect he's not even on this planet.'

He adds: 'I just thought he was on a mobile phone like dozens of people on my daily commute.'

After overtaking the cyclist, the man driving the Land Rover gets stuck in traffic, allowing the biker to catch up and confront him.

The cyclist uses a light to get the driver's attention and then points out his open laptop, mobile phone and headphones before the motorist drives off into the distance.

Police Scotland have said that no-one has been charged in connection with the video but that officers were following a 'line of inquiry'.

Neil Grieg, research and the policy director at the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), said the driver should be 'ashamed'.

The cyclist saw the man as he drove past him but then cycled up behind him and filmed him using a light

The driver then drove ahead of the cyclist, who regularly posts videos from the road on to YouTube

But when the Land Rover driver became stuck in traffic, the cyclist caught up with and confronted him

The incident happened in Aberdeen's Queen's Road (pictured) shortly after 5am on February 5

He said: 'It's a clear example of breaking the law on mobile phone use and the driver should be ashamed to be taking such risks for the sake of keeping in touch.

'No call is more important that someone's life.

'The IAM have no problem with camera users sharing their footage with Police Scotland so that they can consider if formal action is required.'

He added: 'Ideally we would like to see more police out there enforcing the law rather than relying on amateurs.

'No one taking such footage should be pursuing a car just to get a good shot.

'Concentrating on catching someone out is also a distraction from the real task of driving or riding safely.'

Driver caught reading the paper while behind the wheel on the motorway

A driver was seen reading the newspaper while travelling at 55mph on the motorway with a child in the passenger seat

A man was captured reading the newspaper while travelling on the motorway at 55mph with a young girl in the passenger seat. 

Shocked passengers on the M5 took photographs of the man as he drove down the outside lane near Junction 11 in Cheltenham during rush hour yesterday morning. 

Duaine Peacock, who was being driven to work at the time, sent the photograph to the Gloucestershire Road Police Twitter account. 

'I was shocked. It takes the mick a bit,' the 20-year-old trainee mechanic said. 

'I was just coming down the motorway in the passenger seat, and I saw an old car doing 55mph in the middle lane. When we went to overtake him I saw that he was reading with the interior light on.

'And the worst thing was he had his little girl in the passenger seat. She was a very young child, I’d say three or four years old.

'He should have been paying more attention. '

What if someone was to break suddenly to avoid something. It could cause a big pile-up.

'It’s things like that the police get called out to daily. It only takes a split second and then that’s it - you’ve had it.'

Kevin Roseblade, Head of Tri Force Collision Investigation at Gloucester Constabulary, said the driver in question had put a number of people in danger. 

He said: 'Although driving could be considered an everyday activity for many of us it still requires 100 per cent concentration 100 per cent of the time. 

'Whether the driver pictured is reading a newspaper, map, directions or some other form of written material it is extremely dangerous with potentially fatal consequences for him, his passengers and other road users.' 

Aberdeen's 'Cycle Cam' YouTube poster is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cameras.

Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle.

The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users.

Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished.

Lewis Dediare - aka 'Traffic Droid' - also posts footage from his helmet and handlebar cams online

Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year.

He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions.

The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling.

He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.
