Manchester United are wasting no time in rebuilding their squad to launch a fresh assault on the Premier League under the leadership of Louis van Gaal.

They have already splashed on teenage sensation Luke Shaw and midfielder Ander Herrera, with more deals in the pipeline as Van Gaal looks to haul his new side from the wreckage of last season.

Old Trafford could have a Chilean feel next year with midfielder Arturo Vidal and Barcelona's wing star Alexis Sanchez both on Van Gaal's wanted list.

Laying down the law: Louis van Gaal, taking Holland training, will rebuild United's squad

Re-United: Van Gaal will make Robin van Persie his undisputed No 9 up front

Teen star: England's Luke Shaw has already been signed to fill the left-back role

Stalwart: But there may be no room in Manchester United's new line-up for midfielder Michael Carrick

The boss could look closer to home to revamp his back line. Right-back Daryl Janmaat and powerful centre-half Bruno Martins Indi could both be picked up, with both playing in Van Gaal's Holland World Cup side - as does undisputed No 9 Robin van Persie.

Other Dutch stars to be linked with Old Trafford moves include Nigel de Jong and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt.

It means there's no room for current Old Trafford charges Rafael or Phil Jones, while the midfield revamp sees Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini ousted.

Here, Sportsmail looks at a potential starting XI for next season, and some other targets Van Gaal will have in mind.

Theatre of dreams: Could this be Manchester United's new line-up for next season?

United's possible XI for next season (4-3-3): De Gea; Janmaat, Smalling, Martins Indi, Shaw; Vidal, Herrera, Mata; Sanchez, Rooney, Van Persie

And here's Van Gaal's shopping list, including some alternative names that could be lining up at Old Trafford next season.

ARTURO VIDAL Juventus

Chile midfielder rated one of the best in the world was wanted by David Moyes but Juventus would not sell. Real Madrid have discussed £32m offer but it won't be enough.

In action: Arturo Vidal, battling Brazil's Marcelo, is one of the most sought-after midfielders in the world

THOMAS VERMAELEN Arsenal

Belgian has been short on form and confidence but United hope a change of scenery can rediscover the defender of old. Arsenal not keen to sell to United for less than £12million.

DARYL JANMAAT Feyenoord

Exciting right-back. The 24-year-old has been watched by Arsenal closely and was the subject of interest from Tottenham, Napoli and Leicester but Louis van Gaal is a fan.

Home comforts: Van Gaal make look to his Dutch side for right-back Daryl Janmaat

DALEY BLIND Ajax

Luke Shaw and Patrice Evra may be at left-back but Blind is a decent defensive midfielder too. His displays in Brazil will hike up his £12m price but would be an astute addition.

BRUNO MARTINS INDI and STEFAN De VRIJ Feyenoord

Bruno Martins Indi and de Vrij are both ready to leave and 22-year-old de Vrij has been poised to join Lazio. Left-side Indi may offer better balance for United's defence.

Powerful: Bruno Martins Indi (right), iun action against Tim Cahill, may be the answer for United at the back 

ALEXIS SANCHEZ Barcelona

Fleet-footed forward can play comfortably in a 4-3-3, was a United fan as a boy is also wanted by Juventus and Liverpool among others. Barca want around £30million.

World star: Barcelona and Chile's Alexis Sanchez, holding off David Luiz, would be key to a new United attack

KEVIN STROOTMAN Roma

Firm favourite of Van Gaal. Lacks pace but dictates game with strong left foot. His cruciate injury may prompt United to revive interest in Real Madrid's Sami Khedira though.
