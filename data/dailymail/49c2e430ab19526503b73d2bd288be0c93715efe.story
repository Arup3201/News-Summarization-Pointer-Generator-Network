The Duke of Cambridge and his brother
 Prince Harry arrived in Northumberland today for the wedding of their 
old friend Thomas van Straubenzee and society bride Lady Melissa Percy.

Excitement was mounting in Alnwick as the princes arrived in the sunshine ahead of this evening's lavish ceremony.

Crowds
 gathered to see Lady Melissa Percy in her billowing white gown that was
 embellished with lace, and waved as her beaming bridesmaids - including
 Prince Harry's Zimbabwean ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy - walked through 
the town.

Dressed in pale 
espresso floor-length gowns and clutching bouquets, the bridesmaids 
helped the excited-looking bride with her full dress, which was whipped 
up by the north east winds.

were too excited about their wedding to care

 with raised eyebrows - but who or what had prompted his reaction is 
unknown

Royal approval: Prince William and his brother's ex-girlfriend, graduate Chelsy Davy, gathered together to applaud the newly weds

The Duke of Cambridge was without his 
heavily pregnant wife Kate, but there were still plenty of glamorous 
female guests in attendance - including her sister Pippa Middleton, 
Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, Princesses Beatrice and 
Eugenie, and Holly Branson.

The Duchess of Northumberland, 
mother-of-the-bride, told The Journal newspaper ahead of the 
ceremony: 'We are really excited.

'The
weather forecast is not great but Melissa and Thomas do not seem to 
mind. Whatever the weather it is going to be a wonderful day.'

Lady
Melissa is a 26-year-old tennis coach while the groom is a 
chartered-surveyor and long-time friend of both William and Harry.

What a beautiful day! Lady Melissa Percy, 26, is

Hang on! The bride struggled to control her veil as a gust of wind blows her wedding dress over her head before her marriage

What an entrance! Lady Melissa Percy was seen 
seen arriving in an ornate horse drawn carriage for her wedding to 
Thomas Van Straubenzee

The brothers were at the 30-year-old's London stag do earlier this month.

Mr
van Straubenzee travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year and
was reportedly on the phone to Harry when he was mugged in London last 
year. It was said that Harry alerted police and went out to find his 
friend after the ordeal.

Lady Melissa is the Duke of Northumberland's second daughter. She left Alnwick Castle for the church in a restored horse-drawn carriage 
that is almost 200 years old.

When her sister Lady Katie, a 
motorbike mechanic, married at St Michael's Church two years ago, Pippa 
Middleton was a guest. She is friends with Earl George Percy, the Duke's
elder son.

Adorable: The couple appeared to have chosen a 
woodland theme, with the young members of the bridal party sporting pixie and green woodland fairy outfits

She wore a Bruce Oldfield dress with flowers by local florist Caro Dickinson, who has also decorated the church and castle.

After the 5pm service, a reception was held in the castle's State Rooms, followed by dinner in a marquee and fireworks in the evening which the public watched from the pastures below the castle.

Soon
after the wedding, Lady Melissa's dress will be displayed alongside her
sister Katie's wedding dress in The Coach House at Alnwick Castle.

Uniformed police and plain clothes officers kept a close eye on the hundreds gathered to watch the procession.

Block heeled shoes, ankle-length dresses and smaller hats were very much in fashion amongst the guests.

The
couple appeared to have chosen a woodland theme for their nuptials, as 
their pages and young bridesmaids were dressed as Robin Hoods and 
fairies in green.

Two white horses, with coachmen in all their finery, pulled the historic carriage with Lady Melissa and her father.

Chelsy
 Davy, an official attendant to the bride, wore a pale espresso-coloured
 dress, and looked delighted to help her friend with the gown and its 
long train.

Despite the summer date for the wedding, strong winds whipped the light fabric up, making the full gown billow in the breeze. Designer Bruce Oldfield was on hand to make sure it looked perfect.
