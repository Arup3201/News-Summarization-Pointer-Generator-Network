An Amazon listing for a 'gender prediction' kit promising to tell parents the sex of their baby after just six weeks of pregnancy has been banned - because it can't.

Gender Prediction Test, which is still available on the site, claims to 'satisfy your curiosity' more than three months before a hospital ultrasound.

The advert for the £15.99 gadget states: 'Boy of Girl? Pregnancy Baby Gender Prediction Test.

'Misleading': The listing for Gender Prediction Test on Amazon vows to 'satisfy your curiosity' in one minute

'Gender prediction test results in less than a minute.....accurate gender prediction results.'

It continues: 'Are you having a Boy or Girl? With Gendermaker urine gender test you can find out as early as 6 weeks of your pregnancy in the privacy and comfort of your home!

'Gendermaker will satisfy your curiosity and give you accurate results in just seconds. No need to wait until your 18-20 weeks ultrasound to find out the gender of your baby.

'Gendermaker urine gender prediction test will speed up time, and close the gap between your curiosity and ultrasound. Get your urine prediction test today!'.

But duped customers were left dismayed when their test was contradicted by an ultrasound months later.

Blasting the advert as 'misleading', the Advertising Standards Agency said: 'The ASA understood that the product was not able to predict the sex of an unborn child and was designed for amusement only.

'Entertainment': A spokesman for Gendermaker.com admitted the kit is purely for entertainment

Duped customers blasted the unclear advert listing, claiming they could discover their baby's sex three months before their hospital ultrasounds, normally at 18-20 weeks

'We noted the headline claim "Pregnancy Baby Gender Prediction Test", and the claims "Find out if you are having a Boy or a Girl as early as 6 week (sic) of your fetal development", and "Glow pink or blue after determining the gender of your baby", in the body of the ad.

'We considered that a consumer would not be aware of the true nature of the product until they read the full "Product Description", which they could easily overlook.

'In addition, we considered that the claim regarding the fact the product was for entertainment purposes contradicted the overall impression of the ad. Therefore, we concluded that the ad was misleading.'

It added: 'The ad must not appear in its current form again.

'We told Gendermaker.com to ensure they did not state or imply that the product was designed to, and could accurately, predict the sex of an unborn baby, and instead clearly communicate that the product was for entertainment purposes only.'

The ASA said the way the advert was presented made it unlikely customers would know it was a joke

A spokesman for Gendermaker.com said the product was for 'entertainment purposes only' and that the ad 'did not make any claims regarding the accuracy of the product'.

The small print of the advert reads: 'Whilst we are confident in this test, we do not provide any warranty of guarantee as to the results.

'This test is provided for entertainment purposes only. By using the test, you agree to assume all responsibilities or outcomes from your actions or omissions.

'Do not make any financial or emotional investment based on this test.

'If you want an absolute determination of your baby's sex, please consult a medical professional.'
