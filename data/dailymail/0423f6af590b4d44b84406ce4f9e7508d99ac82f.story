Meet the pampered pet who only eats food from Marks and Spencer, has his paws washed with designer soap if he steps outside - and costs his owners a staggering £5,000 a year.

Louis, a Lhasa Apso, detests dog food and will only eat organic scrambled eggs for breakfast, smoked salmon for lunch and Marks and Spencer egg fried rice for dinner, and according to devoted owner Jo Jose, 60, she often hand feeds him.

Louis, or Lou-Lou as he is known to Jo, 60 and husband Graham, 72 from Loughborough, Leics, regularly enjoys being pampered and having his long fur washed with salon bought shampoo - and always enjoys a proper blow dry.

Louis, here with doting Jo, only eats food from Marks and Spencer and  has his paws washed with designer soap if he steps outside

Louis has a list a demands which he likes Jo and Graham to meet, including having his face washed and being talked to at all times

If he goes outside Jo will make sure 
Louis’ paws are hand washed with designer Bulgari soap - costing £10 a 
bar - as according to Jo it makes Louis fur come out the cleanest.

Doting Jo said: 'Lou Lou is utterly spoiled. He eats better than most people do and is very demanding.

'For
 a dog, he is very independent and exudes an air of dignity. He has a 
beautiful long coat is an impressive sight.'

Jo admits that Louis, pictured here with his favorite Chardonnay wine, is more like a 'spoilt child' than a dog

Jo will wash and condition Lou-Lou¿s long fur with Treseme shampoo and conditioner and the pampered dog will often fall asleep while being brushed.

Louis descends from a long line of Crufts champions but he demands to be treated like a human and Jo and Graham think of the 10-year-old mutt as a 'spoilt child.'

After being taken for a long walk at 7am with Graham, in manicured gardens near the family’s home, Louis will demand breakfast for 9.30am sharp.

Jo said: 'It’s as if Louis knows the time and he will come up to me and make it known that he is hungry.

Longhaired Louis takes a lot of grooming and loves to be fussed over, including having his teeth done daily

Louis demands his meals at 9.30am and 6.30pm sharp, and often ends up being hand-fed

At Christmas, pampered pooch Louis will enjoy a share of a £35 filet steak-as the family always have beef wellington instead of turkey

'He won’t eat his food unless someone sits with him in the room, and I often end up hand feeding him.'

Louis also likes to wear clips in his 
hair to keep it out of his eyes and has a selection of £30 dog jackets for when it gets chilly.

Louis sleeps in a £75 fur-lined basket - although he will sneak into the couple’s bed if he can.

After
 a day of doing whatever he pleases, which includes sleeping and playing
 in the garden, Louis then waits for dinner to be cooked for him at 
6.30pm sharp.

Jo said: 'At 
dinner time I will cook up a portion of Marks and Spencer egg-fried 
rice served with freshly cooked and sliced meat. He loves it but can 
sometimes be a little fussy.

He likes you to wash his face

He likes to have his head and body massaged, particularly at night

'I tried him with dog food but he just refuses to eat it.'

Jo and her husband Graham, 72, like to go on holiday to Abu Dhabi four times a year and before they book their holiday they make sure Louis can stay at The Grove, a luxury dog hotel which caters to Louis’ every whim.

Jo said: 'The Grove is fantastic for looking after Louis and cooking him all his different meals at the correct times. They really accommodate for every one of Louis’ needs and we couldn’t be more grateful.

'As soon as we get to our hotel in Abu Dhabi we will video call The Grove and make sure we can speak to Louis.'

Every birthday, the couple will buy a card for Louis with his age on, and Louis will receive a Marks and Spencer Victoria sponge cake, with candles on it.

Jo said: 'We like Lou-Lou to feel special and he enjoys a slice of the cake. We always treat him around Christmas and birthdays - he is like our child.'

And at Christmas, pampered pooch Louis will enjoy a share of a £35 filet steak, as the family always has beef Wellington instead of turkey.

Jo said: 'Lou-Lou loves Christmas because it means he can tuck into Christmas dinner - a filet steak - which is something he loves.

'We like him to feel like one of the family.'

Jo always says good morning and goodnight to Louis everyday as he likes to be greeted and Jo is sure that he is aware of what is being said to him.

Jo said: 'Louis is very particular about what he likes - and doesn’t - just like a child.

'He loves to be stroked and talked to a lot - he understands what we are saying.'

Louis has a list a demands, including having his face washed, being talked to at all times, being massaged and brushed before bed.

Jo said: 'He is hard work sometimes, but we love him and wouldn’t be without him. Lou- Lou is such a character.'
