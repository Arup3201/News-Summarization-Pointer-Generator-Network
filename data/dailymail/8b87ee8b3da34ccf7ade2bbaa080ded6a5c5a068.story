Kriss fled on foot before stealing a bike and heading towards the nearby Gold Coast Shopping Mall with two Delaware officers giving chase

Some criminals will attempt anything to avoid being caught by the police.

But one suspect went to more effort than most, attempting to flee officers from three police forces, a dog unit and a helicopter by driving between two states, stealing a bike and swimming across a lake.

Despite his energetic efforts to escape, it still took officers a taser and a projectile launcher to stop Brion Adam Kriss.

The chase started when police were called to a hit and run crash in a parking lot in Fenwick Island, Delaware, shortly before 10am yesterday.

Officers from nearby South Bethany were drafted in to help find the car when it was spotted driving recklessly half an hour later.

Patrol cars chased Kriss, who was thought to have been armed with a large knife, across the state line and into Ocean City, Maryland, where officers from the Ocean City Police Department joined in the chase.

In a desperate bid to fool police patrols, 23-year-old Kriss turned off the Coastal Highway before rejoining it and hitting two cars.

His attempt to evade police behind the wheel came to an abrupt halt when Kriss crashed into a telegraph pole.

Got him: Police finally managed to arrest the suspect when he was trying to escape by swimming across a bay

But the chase wasn't over yet.

Kriss
fled on foot before stealing a bike and heading towards the nearby Gold
Coast Shopping Mall with two Delaware officers giving desperate chase.

Although
more officers and the Maryland State Police helicopter was brought in 
to help, Kriss, from Illinois, still fancied his chances of avoiding 
capture and dived into the bay behind the shopping mall.

After several officers had allegedly been assaulted trying to stop him, police finally managed to apprehend Kriss who was taken into custody on a small sandbar.

He was taken to Atlantic General Hospital for treatment to injuries sustained during his capture.

Ocean City Police say that they are investigating the collisions involving Kriss's vehicle on the Coastal Highway and that charges are pending in both states.
