'It's ridiculous, it's something that dreams are made of for these players.

'We work hard here and you've seen a youthful energy in the team.'

The United team was largely changed and missing many of its stars but Robinson was eager for his players to get due credit.

'They've got the superstars in the side and they're the ones that are in the public eye on a daily basis, an hourly basis to an extent, we're not,' he added.
