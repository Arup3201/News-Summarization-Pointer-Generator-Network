An exhausted mother polar bear cooled down on ice while her trio of adorable cubs playfully wrestled with each other.

Stunning images show the cubs, thought to be just three months old, demanding their mother's attention all day as they clambered over her.

But, the doting female adult remained patient with her babies despite the fact she always had to be on the lookout for danger.

The heart-warming images were snapped at Wapusk National Park near Manitoba, Canada.

Photographer Matthias Breiter was lucky to get close enough to the family of polar bears to capture the touching moments between the mother and her cubs.

Matthias, 48, from Kenora, Ontario, Canada, said: 'Wapusk is the only place I know where polar bears are easily accessible for photographers.

'The mother was very caring and protective of her cubs, she licked them clean and made sure they stayed close by.

The mother polar bear never let her trio of cubs - thought to be aged three months - out of her sight

'She never interfered though in the little play fights among the cubs.

'She
knew I was there but paid little attention to me as I didn't approach 
them - she never let her cubs be more than a few feet away from her.

'The female adult cooled off on the ice for about half an hour after a play session with her cubs.

'Polar bears can overheat easily and they spread themselves out on the ice to get rid of excess heat in their arms and legs."

Matthias, who is also a biologist specialising in polar bears, added: 'These are some of my best polar bear images.'
