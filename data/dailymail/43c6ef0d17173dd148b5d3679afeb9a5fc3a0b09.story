The Earl of Cardigan has failed in a bid to block the sale of the  ancestral home which has been in his family for almost 200 years for £11.25million.

Trustees of the estate are looking to sell Tottenham House, a 100-room mansion in the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire.

The Earl, who lives in a different house on the estate and is currently living on his £71-a-week Jobseekers' Allowance, took the case to the Court of Appeal as he tried to stand in the way of the sale of the mansion.

Trustees hope to sell the 100-room mansion on the Savernake Estate, but the Earl, 60, took the case to the Court of Appeal

But three appeal judges, Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lady Justice Black and Lord Justice Vos, unanimously agreed to dismiss the Earl's objections.

Lord Justice Vos said Tottenham House was decaying fast and had been largely unoccupied since the 1990s.

He added that 'everyone now agrees it must be sold - what is in dispute is the process by which the sale should be achieved'.

The judge said the trustees of the Savernake Estate were seeking approval 'for their momentous decision' to sell Tottenham House to an unnamed buyer, known only as Mr A, for £11.25m.

They said the sale price was 'a good one that represents an opportunity not to be missed'.

But the Earl, 60, said the price was 'inadequate.' He had wanted the trustees removed 'broadly on the grounds that they are unfit to act'.

After an earlier hearing at the High Court, the Earl said that once the case was over he would 'turn my hand to finding another hotelier who wants to make Tottenham House a very elegant hotel that befits the building'.

The trustees, John Moore, a barrister’s clerk, and Wilson Cotton, an accountant, were appointed by the Earl when he moved to America for four years. 

But when he returned they refused to give up control of the estate, leading him to take legal action.

The bitter dispute that followed has seen the trustees make at least 14 criminal allegations against him, ranging from damaging pheasant feeders to spitting at them, although none of the charges resulted in a conviction. 

Last year, property tycoon Jamie Ritblat was reportedly in discussions with the trustees to buy the Grade I-listed, 19th Century Palladian mansion.
