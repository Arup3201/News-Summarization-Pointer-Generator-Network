Two luxury homes squeezed onto a plot in exclusive Sandbanks in Poole Harbour, Dorset,meant for one have gone up for sale for £13million - three times the value of the former property.

A three bedroom house occupied the 3,000 square metre site  until it was bought for £4.25million and then promptly demolished.

A development company decided to eke out every square inch of the plot by splitting it in two and building a pair of four-storey beachfront houses worth £6.5million each.

They each boast en-suite bedrooms, indoor swimming pools, balconies, lifts to all floors, direct beach access and magnificent sea views.

They are being sold either individually or as a pair should a wealthy buyer wish to live in one and rent out the other. Alternatively, they may appeal to a wealthy couple who want 'his and her' homes. It is thought the developers have spent more than three million pounds building them.

Property in Sandbanks, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', is so sought-after developers are buying single plots and turning them into multiple residences

Tom Doyle, of estate agents Lloyds Property Group which is selling both properties, said: 'Development opportunities are becoming scarcer on Sandbanks and so prices for older houses are going up.

'Developers need to maximise the space available in order to make money. It is becoming harder to financially justify building one home on a plot and so we are now seeing two homes appear.

'Although a lot of the plots are quite deep you can't spread out or go beyond the existing building line so you have build upwards as much as the planning authorities will allow.

'Both these properties are built over four levels, with the bedrooms on the upper two floors.

'They are very much high end in terms of their quality. I can see these appealing to middle-age professionals who want them as a second home.'

The property before development began. It was in the 1960s that the peninsula first underwent a property boom

Property in Sandbanks, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', is so sought-after developers are buying single plots and turning them into multiple residences.

One of them built two 16ft wide detached houses just 10 inches apart on a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre, replacing a single home that stood on the same site.

Despite the homes being smaller than many other homes in the sought-after community the developers managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into each of the 840sq ft properties, which also have their own driveways.

The properties, named Tom and Jerry, were designed and built by Seven Developments, owned by former AFC Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell, and have gone up for sale with an asking price of £745,000 each.

Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property.

Wasteland: The site after it was cleared ready for development. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million on the peninsula

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century. Now it has turned into a Millionaires' Row, filled with luxury beachfront mansions

Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel.

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions.

The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand.

In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre.

Before: The two three-bedroom homes have been built on this single plot once occupied by a simple bungalow

In May a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value.

Earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million.

In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down.

Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there.
