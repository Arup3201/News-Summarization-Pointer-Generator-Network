The 25-year-old had been asked to attend her local police station to hand in her licence after earlier being caught on camera driving whilst banned. Pictured is the porn star in one of her films 

A police spokesman said: 'At one point she was going at 136 mph and officers called in other cars for support.

'When they eventually stopped her she gave a fake name, which is something she has often done, and said she had forgotten her driving licence.

'When the officers explained that she had given them her driving licence just half an hour before, she cursed and when she was arrested, she didn’t seem at all surprised.'

When Muellerova was tested by police from drugs after being arrested, it was found that she was high on crystal meth 

'She was heavily under the influence of crystal meth and admitted she had taken the drug.

'She has been charged with dangerous driving, driving under the influence of a narcotic, taking narcotics, obstructing the police and endangering the lives of others.'

If found guilty the porn star, who appears in several adult films, faces three years in jail.
