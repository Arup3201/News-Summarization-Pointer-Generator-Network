The Golden Bear got a gold medal - and apparently caused House Speaker  John Boehner to tear up.

Congress on Tuesday awarded its highest civilian honor to golfing great Jack Nicklaus, who accepted the gold medal with a few tears, humility and humor.

In a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, the House and Senate leadership bestowed the award on Nicklaus, winner of 18 major championships, including six Masters titles, five PGA championships and four U.S. Opens.

John Boehner, an avid golfer who is also known for crying publicly, was photographed misty-eyed at the event while sitting next to Nicklaus.

'Few transcend their sport to achieve that kind of moment, or this kind of honor,' said Boehner, who grew emotional at times during the ceremony. 

He continued 'With Arnie (Palmer), it was how he brought an audience to the game - an army. With Jack, it's how he gave the game a gold standard - a ladder to climb.'

The 75-year-old Nicklaus, dubbed the Golden Bear, recalled the hard work of his parents, praised his family and paid tribute to his wife, Barbara. 

Nicklaus was quoted by Devil Ball Golf as saying 'She is responsible for 15 of my major championships. I'll give myself three of them.'

He recalled that when his son Jack was six, he was asked what his father did for a living. The younger Nicklaus said, 'nothing, he just plays golf.'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said Nicklaus had a brush with polio as a teenager. McConnell said that as a fellow survivor of polio he appreciated Nicklaus' perseverance.
