Talk about playing hard to get! 

A combative female hare boxes away a would-be suitor in the snow-dusted Scottish Highlands as the mating season gets under way.

Professional wildlife photographer Andy Rouse, who captured this aggressive ritual in the Cairngorms, said: ‘The two mountain hares were sitting down and chilling out about 20 yards apart when all of a sudden one got up, ran over and punched the other.’

The annual ritual was once thought to be a contest for dominance between males. But it is, in fact, a battle of the sexes in which females – who tend to be heftier than the males – weed out unsuitable partners

The hares boxed backwards and forwards for ten minutes before one gave up and was chased away. 

‘They were dancing,’ Mr Rouse said. ‘Their arms were moving so fast, you couldn’t see the punch clearly.

‘But their claws were out and they really meant it.’

The annual ritual, which gave rise to the saying ‘mad as a March hare’, was once thought to be a contest for dominance between males.

But it is, in fact, a battle of the sexes in which females – who tend to be heftier than the males – weed out unsuitable partners.

Only those bucks strong enough to last the bruising round will be considered a worthy mate.

As they square up to each other and attempt to stare each other out these two competitors demonstrate one of the animal world's more hare-raising mating rituals
