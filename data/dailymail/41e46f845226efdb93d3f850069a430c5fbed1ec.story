Katy Perry's new music video has been edited to remove a pendant which read 'Allah' after an outraged Muslim man launched a petition.

Shzad Iqbal, from Bradford, claimed the video 'promoted blasphemy' as it showed the necklace being disintegrated along with the man wearing it, and asked YouTube to take it down.

While the clip has not been removed, it has been edited to remove the necklace after the petition attracted 65,000 signatures in three days.

Spot the difference: Katy Perry's video for Dark Horse featured a man wearing a pendant which read Allah in Arabic (left). However it has now been removed (right) after an outraged Muslim man set up a petition

In the video Perry plays an Egyptian princess looking for a suitor but disintegrates each one when they displease her

The first man, who is wearing the Allah pendant, presents Perry with a giant diamond but is disintegrated

However it is not clear whether it was YouTube or Perry's record label which removed the offending item. Calls from Mail Online to the record label have not been returned.

Compared to raunchy videos by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, Perry's offering could have been considered tame, if it weren't for the Arabic symbol for Allah around the man's neck.

In his complaint, Mr Iqbal said: 'The video is considered as highly controversial to its viewers as a result of its portrayal of blasphemy.

'Blasphemy is clearly conveyed in the video, since Katy Perry (who appears to be representing an opposition of God) engulfs the believer and the word God in flames.

'This is the reason for lodging the petition so that people from different walks of life, different religions and from different parts of the world, agree that the video promotes blasphemy.

The petition claimed that the video 'promotes blasphemy' and urges people from around the world to sign, arguing that no religion would tolerate the name God being used in a 'disrespectful manner'

The petition collected 65,000 signatures from countries including Australia, India and Saudi Arabia

'Using the name of God in an irrelevant and distasteful manner would be considered inappropriate by any religion '

The video currently has more than 38million views though has more than 100,000 'dislikes' and several negative comments mentioning the pendant.

After signing the petition, Bilal Khan, from Birmingham, said: 'Absolutely Disgusted at the music industry for allowing this to happen, music should be about spreading love not hate.

It's shameful that you allow stupidity, you need to look up the meaning of the word explicit.'

Fellow signatory Taufik Hidayat, from Bandung, Indonesia, added: 'This video is really offensive to [the] Muslim faith!'

Dark Horse is Perry's third single off her new album 'Prism' and features American rapper Juicy J.

The hip-hop infused pop song is currently sitting at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 list.

The international pop star released the music video on February 20 on her official Twitter page to her more than 50 million followers. It currently has almost 30 million views.
