With Valentine's Day around the corner, we thought we would bring you some outfit inspiration for that hot date (or girly visit to see Fifty Shades Of Grey).

A look that we can’t get enough of at the moment is the midi skirt. Be it pencil, pleated or A-line, we love it.

It’s a classy look that works well for all body shapes. The midi can end just below the knee or a couple of inches above the ankle - or anywhere in-between.

Louise Redknapp and Emma Thatcher, who run A Style Album, demonstrate how to pull off a midi skirt in style for a hot date or girly night this Valentine's Day

Choose wisely depending on your height, if you’re shorter like Lou, opt for just below the knee to elongate the leg. If you're slightly taller like Em, you can get away with a slightly longer length. 

Up until recently, wearing a skirt below the knee wouldn't have been regarded as a particularly fashionable look, but right now, it couldn't be more on trend.

The style is perfect for the cold weather when teamed with tights, boots and a chunky knit and will carry over through spring with bare legs and a pair of sandals.

Victoria Beckham is a huge fan of the midi skirt and the look featured heavily in her SS15 show. 

The fashion designer is often seen out in a below the knee skirt looking chic and stylish, and her look is very achievable whatever your budget.

If the leather midi is a look you don't want to invest in now, there are plenty of other options around come Spring and Zara is full to the brim with the style staple

Em, pictured, and Lou headed out for a girlie dinner this week and tackled the midi. They say they felt modern and comfortable; a midi is a great staple to have in your wardrobe

Another style icon who does the midi look well is Christine Centenera - Kim Kardashian recently revealed she seeks style inspiration from the  Vogue fashion editor - and we have both long been fans of her cool, edgy look.

Christine favours the leather below the knee skirt and we’ve found some great options on the high street.

So keep it classy this Valentine's Day and take inspiration from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jourdan Dunn's on-trend style.

If it’s a look you don’t want to invest in now, there are plenty of other options around come Spring. 

Take note of Michael Kors SS15 show and play around with colour and texture, keep it simple on top and go for a bright bold midi for a modern look.

Or go for a stripe; Sienna Miller nailed two trends in one simple outfit, pulling off clashing stripes (you can get the look at Zara).

We headed out for a girlie dinner this week and tackled the midi. Lou opted for leather and Em a stripy tube skirt. We felt modern and comfortable; a midi is a great staple to have in your wardrobe.
