Nicolas Anelka has announced he will tear up his contract with West Brom and leave the club over the fall-out from his infamous 'quenelle' goal celebration - but the Baggies claim the striker has not informed them yet, labelling the Frenchman 'unprofessional'.

Anelka is on Saturday due to begin a five-match ban imposed for making the gesture, which has anti-Semitic links, after scoring against West Ham on December 28. An independent regulatory commission accepted there was no intent by Anelka to be anti-Semitic.

But confusion remains over Anelka’s future as West Brom on Friday evening claimed they had received no formal resignation from him or his advisors and criticised him for issuing the statement on social media.

Sacked: Nicolas Anelka had been supported by West Brom after his 'quenelle' gesture (above) but has now had his contract terminated

Fresh start: Anelka revealed earlier in the day via Social Media that he was terminating his contract

Friend: The gesture is linked to Anelka's friend, the controversial French comedian Dieudonne Mbala Mbala

Anelka's club opted not to appeal against the
 sanction, and after holding talks with his employers the former France 
striker wrote on Twitter: 'I have taken the decision to free myself and 
put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich Albion.'

Anelka claims he made the gesture in 
support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a French comedian who has
 been convicted seven times of anti-Semitic crimes.

Following
 the incident, Anelka started all four of Albion's Premier League games 
in January. But he has not featured since and is banned for the upcoming
 trips to Swansea, Hull and Norwich as well as home games against 
Cardiff and Tottenham.

Over 
the course of three posts written in French on his official Twitter 
account, Anelka wrote:

'Following talks between the club and me, 
propositions were made to me in order to reintegrate me into the squad 
under certain conditions that I cannot accept.

'Wishing
 to retain my integrity, I have therefore taken the decision to free 
myself and put an end to the contract linking me with West Bromwich 
Albion to 2014, with immediate effect.'

Harsher: The FA argued for a more severe sanction than the five-match ban

Ban: Belgian futsal player Omar Rahou received a 10 match ban for the same gesture

But West Brom said in a statement that they had not heard from Anelka regarding the termination of his contract.

The
 club said: 'The club confirms it has been continuing discussions with 
Nicolas Anelka and his advisers as part of its own internal enquiry into
 the gesture he made after scoring against West Ham United on December 
28.

'Following the 
conclusion of the FA's enquiry into the same incident, the club had 
hoped to conclude its own investigations next week.

'The
 club notes Nicolas Anelka's comments on Twitter this evening [Friday]. 
However, the club has received nothing formally regarding the 
termination of Nicolas Anelka's contract from either him or his 
advisers.

'The club regards
 the release of such a statement on social media as highly 
unprofessional and will make a further statement when appropriate.'

Comparison: The panel looked at the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra and John Terry-Anton Ferdinand cases when coming to their decision

Anelka
 is only eligible for the Baggies' last five games of the season but the
 club are yet to confirm the former Arsenal star's claims.

On Thursday the Football Association decided 
against appealing against the length of Anelka’s five-match ban,
 issued by an independent commission for his anti-Semitic gesture.

Anelka
 is understood to have also accepted the ruling which means his 
suspension now begins, starting with West Bromwich Albion’s match at 
Swansea on Saturday.

The FA 
were considering an appeal to obtain an increase to the ban, which was 
the minimum that could be handed out based on the governing body’s new 
rules overseeing offences of a racist nature.

West
 Brom’s own investigation into the Frenchman’s actions is still ongoing,
 with a conclusion expected next week. The club had not ruled out 
sacking the player for his quenelle gesture.

An
 FA statement read: ‘Having carefully considered the written reasons of 
the Independent Regulatory Commission together with our appointed QC, 
The FA can confirm it will not be appealing the sanction imposed on 
Nicolas Anelka.

‘The grounds
 of appeal available to us are limited to legal challenges or to 
circumstances in which the sanction imposed is “so unduly lenient as to 
be unreasonable".

‘As
 the written reasons make clear, The FA pressed the Commission at the 
original hearing to impose a suspension of greater than five matches.

‘We do not consider there is a real prospect of successfully appealing to extend the sanction imposed.’

An Independent Regulatory Commission found an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 against Nicolas Anelka proven and issued a five-match suspension and a fine of £80,000, pending appeal.

The West Bromwich Albion player was ordered to complete a compulsory education course.

The Independent Regulatory Commission will provide written reasons for its decision in due course.

Mr Anelka had the right to appeal the decision. Mr Anelka must notify The FA of his intention to appeal within seven days of receipt of the written reasons.

The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the time for appealing expires, or Mr Anelka notifies The FA of his decision not to appeal.
