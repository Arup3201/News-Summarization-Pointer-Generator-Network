It represents a unique and quite eye-opening twist on the old ‘show us your medals’ game so beloved in professional football.

While Dundee United as a club have had five trophy triumphs to celebrate across 106 years, their current manager, Jackie McNamara, boasts 10 winners’ gongs from just a decade of service at Celtic.

Those starkly contrasting totals serve to drive home to McNamara just how fleeting it is for teams outwith Rangers and Celtic to lift silverware.

Jackie McNamara insists his Dundee side must make amends for last term's League Cup anguish

And as he prepares his United side to face holders Aberdeen in today’s League Cup semi-final, it also serves to imbue the highly-decorated 41-year-old with fresh desire to avenge the crushing low of last season’s 2-0 Scottish Cup Final loss to St Johnstone.

At Celtic Park, McNamara’s band of talented youngsters wilted in the May heat, blowing their big chance to capture the trophy for just the third time in Tannadice history.

For the United boss, the regrets remain. But he wants his side to make amends by seizing the day against the Dons this afternoon and moving one step closer to the Tayside club’s first League Cup success since 1980.

McNamara is happy the Rangers vs Celtic has taken the top billing for the League Cup semi-final 

‘The chance to win trophies doesn’t come around all that often, so you need to grasp it,’ said McNamara.

‘But last season, after Celtic had been knocked out of the Scottish Cup, we didn’t manage to do that.

‘Scottish football has changed a lot in the last four or five years and the gulf isn’t as big as it possibly should have been. The gap is still there in terms of budgets but, when it comes to quality, it’s not as big as it should be. So it was a real chance for us last season.

‘Could I have done anything differently? Yes, you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t make mistakes.

‘I make mistakes every day and so do players. I’m always learning and I learned from last season. Disappointments makes you stronger and hopefully good things will come from it.

‘But, to be honest, I tend not to look at the past. As a player, I won finals and lost finals. And, when you win, it’s all about winning the next one. When you lose, it’s about going again.

Dundee United are looking to reach the Scottish Cup final again and do themselves justice on the day

‘For me, we did well to reach the Scottish Cup final but just didn’t do ourselves justice on the day. So the important thing for us is to get back there – and not leave anything behind this time.’

McNamara does not wholly subscribe to the view that the fall of Rangers represents a limited window of opportunity for clubs like United. The theory goes that the Ibrox club – as unlikely as it seems in these present times - will one day get their act together off the park, making it more unlikely for trophies to end up at Tannadice.

For the United boss – who has a track record of unearthing low-cost gems like Andy Robertson and Charlie Telfer – it depends on how you manage your resources.

‘Whether it’s a window of opportunity remains to be seen,’ he said.

‘It all depends on what happens there and at Celtic, as well. Rangers still have a budget that dwarves ours – and Aberdeen’s, as well. So I don’t see that as a given.

‘If you look at when we beat Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final last year, they dwarfed our budget then.

‘We were playing kids like Ryan Gauld and John Souttar, who we’d brought through the youth system. It’s about how you use the resources, and about having a structure in place for the future.’ McNamara proves a touch sheepish when recalling his first League Cup win with Celtic.

Jeff Holmes is looking to guide Dundee United to Hampden Park with a win against Aberdeen 

‘It was against Dundee United at Ibrox (in 1997),’ he said. But he was more forthcoming about his love of playing at Hampden during his career, especially scoring the opener in a 3-0 Scottish Cup final win over Hibs.

And he urged his players to fulfil their dreams at the national stadium against an Aberdeen side he considers favourites.

‘I loved playing at Hampden,’ he continued. ‘As a kid, you dream of playing here and scoring in finals. I was fortunate enough to do it at Celtic and there’s no better feeling. I want my players to live the moments I had as a player. I’m effectively like a schoolteacher passing on bits of wisdom and belief.

‘I’m sure that every kid still dreams of playing and scoring at Hampden in a cup final, never mind a semi. So the big thing for us on Saturday is to get the win which will take us to the final.

Henri Anier looks ahead to his side's crucial cup clash against Aberdeen

‘I think Aberdeen go into it as favourites because they won it last year and they have a bit more experience in their squad – guys like Niall McGinn, Willo Flood and Barry Robson, who have been at Celtic.

‘We only have one or two who have the experience of winning trophies. It will be about getting them to settle down, not think about the occasion too much and just to play their normal game.’

McNamara is happy the Rangers v Celtic match tomorrow has taken top billing over today’s encounter which is likelier to be a better, closer contest.

‘Not at all,’ he said when asked about whether it bothered him. ‘When the draw was made, no one spoke about our game because the Old Firm have not played for a few seasons.

‘If anything, it has made our game a bit more low key, which is fine. The players are not as nervous about it as much. I’ll probably watch the other game in the house on Sunday. It is probably better to stay out the way.’

Nor is McNamara worried about the prospect of United fans being outnumbered by up to three to one at Hampden.

‘Aberdeen have fantastic backing, they’re a one team city and they won the cup last year,’ he said. ‘It’s a bit less for us because we have two teams in the city.

‘But we will still have a healthy crowd coming down. Hopefully we can send them back up the road happy and then we will have even greater numbers for the final.’
