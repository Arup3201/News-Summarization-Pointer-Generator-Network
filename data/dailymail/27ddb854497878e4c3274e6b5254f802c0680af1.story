An investment manager dying from Motor Neurone Disease today called on the Government to allow people with terminal illnesses to take experimental drugs.

Les Halpin, 55, was diagnosed with the degenerative condition two years ago and although the likelihood of finding a cure for him is unlikely, he is volunteering to try new drugs so that others have a better chance of surviving in the future.

Mr Halpin, who previously enjoyed skiing and flying but is now confined to a wheelchair, has began a campaign for better medical advances after discovering there has been only one drug licensed to treat Motor Neurone Disease in the past 20 years.

There are currently an estimated 
3.5million people in the UK suffering from 'rare' diseases that are 
considered uneconomic for research efforts by major drug companies.

But Mr Halpin, from Tetbury, Gloucestershire, says the problem is made even worse by the bureaucracy that stops patients taking unlicensed drugs.

Professor Stephen Hawking suffers from a type of Motor Neurone Disease

Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive illness that attacks the motor neurones, or nerves, in the brain and spinal cord.

This means messages gradually stop reaching muscles, which leads to weakness and wasting.

MND can affect how people walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. However, not all symptoms necessarily happen to everyone and it is unlikely they will all develop at the same time, or in any specific order.

There is currently no cure for MND and only one drug licensed to treat it - Riluzole.

It is available freely on the NHS and has been shown to have a modest impact on survival.

MND can affect any adult at any age but most people diagnosed with the disease are over the age of 40, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 70

Men are affected approximately twice as often as women.

About two people in every 100,000 will develop MND each year.

Professor Stephen Hawking is perhaps the most well-known sufferer of Motor Neurone Disease.

The physicist was diagnosed in 1963 and has to communicate using a computer system which detects movement in his cheeks.

Because his nerves are continuing to deteriorate, the are fears that he will ultimately lose the ability to communicate completely, leaving his brain 'locked in' to his body.

Speaking to the Today programme on Radio 4 he said he was prepared to take the risk of trialling an unlicensed drug: 'Absolutely, and I think many other MND patients would be.

Expert: Immunologist Sir Peter Lachmann said the current laws make it difficult for smaller companies to bring new drugs to the market

'Obviously there are risks, but for most people in this situation they do a lot of research into the subject and they work in conjunction with their doctors and they aren't going to do anything too out of the ordinary.

'I will be dead anytime between this afternoon and a few years off. I already can't move my arms and my legs and I have trouble breathing. Before I had the condition, I would have agreed with them. But now my thinking is that there's so much more we can do.

'Let's try anything - what have we got to lose?'

On average it takes £1 billion and 10 
years to bring a new drug to market – something so prohibitive that more
 than 90 per cent of drugs do not make it through the system.

Sir Peter Lachmann, an expert immunologist from Cambridge University, agreed there is a need for a change in the law.

He said on the Today programme: 'The present drug regulations make it impossible for smaller drug companies to take drugs to the market.

'It can only be done by larger pharmaceutical companies.'

Mr Halpin has now launched a petition, 
which will be handed to the Department of Health, calling for 
experimental drugs to be available in return for to terminally ill 
patients giving up the right to sue if they experience side effects.

He said: 'No new drug has been approved for Motor Neurone Disease since Riluzole was approved 20 years ago. 

'For those with life threatening illnesses the risk-ratio of “doing nothing” is hugely significant and must be considered. People in this situation must be able to access all the information on a drug that they need - even if the risk of adverse effects or failure are great.'
