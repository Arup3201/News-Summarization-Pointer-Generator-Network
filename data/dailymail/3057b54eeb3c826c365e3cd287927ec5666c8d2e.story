A woman was savagely attacked on Thanksgiving by her girlfriend’s brother during a family gathering.

Mallory Owens was attending the dinner in Mobile, Alabama, with girlfriend Alex Hawkins when the family affair turned violent.

According to reports, Miss Hawkins' brother Travis did not approve of their relationship and attacked Miss Owens after dinner, allegedly knocking her down and pummeling her with his fists.

Brutality: Miss Owens was hospitalized for several days after the attack, receiving treatment for a broken nose in the beating that was so bad her eyes were swollen shut

Her mother Kristi Taylor told WKRG-TV: 
'He tried to kill her. He's lucky he didn't kill her. She's lucky to be 
alive. I didn't recognize her when I got here. It's hard to look at her 
like that.'

Miss Owens was hospitalized and treated for a broken nose and numerous lacerations. Her eyes were swollen shut after the brutal beating and she had to receive facial reconstruction surgery.

Ms Taylor said that there was friction with the Hawkins family over the fact that her daughter was gay and had a relationship with the sister, which Hawkins reportedly did not approve of.

Despite the accusations, Hawkins 
cannot be charged with a hate crime because Alabama law doesn't include
sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the 
Anti-Defamation League.

The accused: Travis Hawkins was charged with second-degree assault in the attack, and was later released on bond

And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other
states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT 
community, including Texas, Virginia and Missouri.

Earlier this year, Hawkins allegedly 
hit Miss Owens over the head with a pipe wrench. While she was injured 
in that attack, no charges were filed.

While Mallory Owens' attacker has been charged in the vicious beating, friends and family of the woman are shocked that additional charges have not been filed.

But despite the nature of the alleged beating, Travis Hawkins cannot be charged with a hate crime in Alabama.

The state's law does not include sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT community.

In 2010, the FBI reported 1,470 offenses based on sexual orientation bias in Alabama.

Her mother told the station: 'I did not 
want her to go, I begged her not to go, knowing how the family felt 
about her. But she said, "They're trying to be nice."'

Hawkins was arrested on Sunday and charged with second-degree assault, and later released on bond.

Family and supporters of Miss Owens believe those charges should be much more severe.

A Facebook group entitled 'Charge Travis Hawkins Jr with the attempted murder of Mallory Owens' has sprung up on Facebook, garnering nearly 600 likes in less than a day.

Miss Owens' sister Avery Godwin told AL.com that Hawkins called her on Friday to say 'that he would finish what he started last night with Mallory.'

Information about an attorney for Hawkins was not immediately available.

It’s also not the first time that police have been called to the Hawkins home.

Last year, Hawkins was hospitalized after he was allegedly shot in the chest by his father, Travis Hawkins Sr.

WKRG-TV
reported that the elder Hawkins was later released on bail and the case
was never brought to trial after his son refused to testify against 
him.
