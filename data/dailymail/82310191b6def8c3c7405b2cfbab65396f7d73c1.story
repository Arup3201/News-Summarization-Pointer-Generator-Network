There has been a surprising new trend for men in Chelsea this week which has seen several of them walking around topless.

Alex Mytton turned up in Binky Felstead’s kitchen wearing nothing more than a snug pair of briefs and Jamie Laing has taken to doing his housework in a pair of superhero pants.

I wanted to join in the craze but in London it’s getting far too cold for that, winter has well and truly arrived.

Miami Nights: Vigorous clapping at Miami Heat game led to seriously swollen hands

The coldest night of the year so far coincided last week with the opening of the new Perrier Jouet champagne and shots roof terrace at London’s rock and roll hotel – the Sanctum Soho on Warwick Street.

As always, when free drinks are involved the music industry descended in droves and the roof was packed with hip rock and indie bands, as well as a good friend of mine Stacey Jackson, whose dance music video I appeared in.

The terrace comes complete with a hot tub but no one was brave enough for that in practically sub zero temperatures.

It’s not just the cold outdoors that’s been bothering me, there’s been a rather frosty atmosphere around London’s SW3 neighbourhood from some of the residents recently as anyone who watched last night’s Made In Chelsea show could have seen.

So myself and Jamie decided to decamp to sunnier climes. There was the rather tenuous excuse of some promotional work in Florida and we were off. One nine-hour BA flight later and we could hear the seductive chant of 'Bienvenido a Miami'.

Spencer's secret: I took a quick selfie with my sunnies on with one of the models who recently was called for a casting for Victoria's Secret. I think you can see why...

We were invited to stay with Bill Dean, a billionaire who runs one of the biggest privately owned engineering companies in the USA.

Four years ago he bought an exquisite colonial-style mansion with amazing views of Miami Beach, and transformed this amazing $40m property into a breathtaking 15 bedroom house with marble floors, outdoor hot tubs, three fountains, a waterfall, three guest cottages, a spa, and even its own nightclub.

I first met Bill when he was on holiday in St Barths and he is a totally charming guy and most generous host. It would have been rude not to take up his invite especially as I may not have the chance to see him in Barths this Christmas.

Things started well as soon as we touched down. Temperatures are in the 30s so it was straight into shorts and T-shirts.

Since that point it’s pretty much been one long party.

First up Story nightclub on Miami Beach on Friday - It’s a huge super-club with a beautiful dancers and an amazing light show, it had great energy and we had a table booked for us in the middle of it all.

But this was merely the aperitif for the weekend’s fun but the best was yet to come - Liv club on Saturday night was off-the-hook.

It’s quite simply one of the best clubs in the world. A room packed with some of the most beautiful people (and by people, I mean women) in the world, dancing suggestively, up for a good time, and friendly.

Mix that up with several shots of Patron Tequila, a theatrical backdrop and confetti liberally sprayed in the air and then you start to get an idea of a big night out at Liv.

The club went on to 5am and then it was time for the after-party back at Bill’s mansion. We had some new friends back in the limo and then Jamie and I entertained them with a game of topless bartender in the club at the mansion.

Thankfully both myself and Jamie are in impeccably good shape at the moment. I’ve been working out hard down the gym and have been taking these amazing new Forza T5 Super Strength diet supplements – but more about that another time, this was party week, not work-out week.

Another tough day followed on Monday when we took our new friends out on Bill’s 90 foot Warren yacht called Moksha – it’s the Hindu term for reaching enlightenment, and I think we came close on this boat ride with four top models.

We work out: Me and Jamie (R) are in great shape right now so had no qualms ripping our tops off

One last big night before we return to Blighty and we were off to see Miami Heat play Pheonix Suns with Court-side seats at the American Airlines Arena.

The home side won 107-92, with LeBron James scoring 35 points.

So we had to celebrate again at a club. Rude not to.

Wish you were here, Spencer xxx
