A delegation of German visitors on a visit to their British twin town were left shocked when they were greeted at a village wartime festival by revellers dressed in Nazi SS officer uniforms.

Members of the 30-strong party from Hamm were horrified to find the villagers donning swastikas and other Nazi regalia during Haworth’s latest 1940s-style celebration.

Some visitors to the event, which takes place each year in the small village near Bradford in West Yorkshire, were seen wearing uniforms of the SS - the Third Reich paramilitary organisation responsible for many of the atrocities against humanity in the Second World War.

'Disgrace': Re-enactors sport SS uniforms during last year's 1940s celebration in Haworth, West Yorkshire. German delegates visiting this year's event were shocked when they came face-to-face with similar outfits

'Offensive': Other visitors wearing Second World War uniforms at last year's event in Haworth. The reaction by the 30-strong German delegation this year has led organisers to ban the wearing of Nazi outfits at future events

Some were wearing the uniform of the 60th Panzer unit, whose outfits included a sinister death head skull.

Haworth parish councillor Barry 
Thorne, who was acting as a tour guide for the German visitors from 
Bradford’s twin town, called for the 'downright disgraceful' uniforms to
 be banned at future events.

He
 said: 'When they first came along the bottom of the street it was like 
the parting of the seas and people were looking and thinking ‘what are 
they doing?’ You have got to think that at the very least, they are 
idiots. 

'One visitor said to me that, if that had happened in Germany, they would have been arrested straight away.

'I
 think the German people were all just shocked that it was even allowed.
 They came because they love Bradford and that is something that they 
wanted to see.'

Setting: The German party were visiting a 1940s festival in the picturesque hilltop village of Haworth

Shadow cast: The delegation went to the 1940s event while visiting Bradford, which is the twinned with their home city of Hamm (pictured)

Big disappointment: The Kurhaus hotel in Hamm. Although it was a 1940s event, the delegates were clearly not expecting to come across any Nazi attire

He said he and parish council 
chairman Councillor John Huxley confronted the men dressed as SS 
officers at last weekend's event and were told it was 'only a bit of fun'.

But Councillor Thorne said those wearing the uniforms could be considered to have broken race laws.

He
 said: 'They were wearing black uniforms and I asked them to leave, the 
chairman of the parish council, John Huxley, asked them to leave, and I 
understand the police were not happy either.

'It
 is not a bit of fun. It is downright disgraceful and should not be 
allowed. I think they were in breach of the law by incitement.

'If anybody had been there who had lost family in the Holocaust, they may have been so angry as to take action.

Cultural links: The delegates from Hamm, in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia, came to Bradford because they loved the city, a Haworth parish councillor said

'It is against the spirit of what the 40s weekend is about and I think it is certainly anti-semitic.

'It is something that we need to deal with next year. We don’t need anything like that.'

Nikki Carroll, one of the 20-strong organising committee for the 1940s festival, said it was 'totally against' the wearing of Nazi uniforms.

She said: 'We very much want to respect the people that we lost in the war and would totally discourage anybody wearing the Nazi uniform and swastikas.

'We did ask people who were wearing swastikas if they could possible remove them and ask people to be more respectful but it is difficult because it is up to them what they do or not.

'As a committee, we need to look a bit more into what we can do about it next year.'
