The battle to stop foreign invaders killing off native British wildlife is costing £1.7billion a year.

Among the biggest culprits are Japanese knotweed, American grey squirrels, Russian zebra mussels and Eastern European ‘killer’ shrimp.

BBC research revealed that the total bill for defending British animals and plants from the ‘alien’ invasion costs £1.7billion a year – or more than £25 for every person in the country.

Only humans do more harm to native biodiversity than foreign species.

Tackling Japanese knotweed costs the economy £165million a year, according to figures from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

The most costly problem is the European rabbit, with damage to crops and measures to control it adding up to more than £260million a year, the Defra data showed.

BBC1’s Countryfile said other major culprits include mink, which were imported from the US by fur farms but escaped to wreak havoc, and American signal crayfish.

The programme highlighted how zebra mussels have so infested Rutland Water in Rutland that Anglian Water has had to spend £500,000 to install special filters to sift them out because they spread so quickly, clogging pipes.

Cambridge University zoologist Dr David Aldridge explained how the mussels – which have distinctive striped shells –  arrived in the UK about ten years ago on the hulls of ships from Eastern Europe.

They reproduce so rapidly they kill off local mussels by growing all over them, starving them  of food.

Rutland Water now contains millions of zebra mussels, he said.

‘A single individual can produce a million offspring in a year.

‘They are probably the dominant organism now in this water. What we are finding in the UK is where zebra mussels are established, native mussels are declining very rapidly.’

Chris Featherstone, from Anglian Water, said: ‘Every year we have to take tons of these shells away to keep the water flowing.’

American mink is another creature noted in the programme, which warns we need £1.7bn to save the wild

Countryfile reporter Tom Heap said: ‘From the grey squirrel,  American crayfish, mink driving water voles from our river banks and the small but scarily-named “killer shrimp”, a whole host of  animals and plants are playing their part in colonising our countryside.

‘Luckily, of the 2,000 non-native species living among us, only a few hundred are actually harmful.’

The water vole – often associated with the character Ratty in Wind In The Willows – is Britain’s fastest declining native mammal.

In 1990, there were seven million living on the riverbanks. By 1998, there were fewer than one million and numbers are continuing to decline. As well as falling prey to escaped mink, they have seen changes in farming destroy their habitats.

Trevor Reynolds, invasive species adviser at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Our priority has to be tackling non-native species, because they lack natural pests and enemies.’

Japanese knotweed, brought  to Britain by Victorian botanists as an ornamental pond plant, is one of the fastest spreading invaders.

During building of the Olympic Park in East London it cost an estimated £70million to remove the plant and dispose of it.

Red squirrels are only just starting to increase their numbers after nearly 140 years of losing out to grey squirrels introduced from North America.

Plantlife is also at risk, with warnings that the native bluebell could disappear within a decade.

It is being squeezed out by a cross between the British bluebell and a Spanish cousin introduced more than 300 years ago.

Some invaders even pose a health risk. The sap of giant hogweed  can cause painful blisters and the caterpillar of the oak processionary moth can cause a fatal allergic reaction.
