The Ministry of Defence has admitted putting down healthy horses in the latest animal scandal to hit the military.

Almost 200 of the animals have been killed by MoD vets in the past ten years - including 20 that were physically healthy but were said to have 'dangerous temperaments.'

Figures released by the military under 
Freedom of Information requests reveal that since 2003, 44 horses have 
been destroyed after they were diagnosed with severe arthritis.

Other horses were put down because of ­untreatable medical conditions, the Sunday People reports.

A further 19 were killed because of untreatable tendon injuries.

Since 2010, of those destroyed nine were deemed to have dangerous temperaments, eight had untreatable injuries and six had colic.

The MoD said killing the animals was always a last resort.

A vet - who asked to remain anonymous - told the paper the statistics were worrying.

They said: 'I’d like to know why euthanasia was regarded as the only appropriate treatment.'

It is not the first animal welfare scandal to hit the MoD.

Last month it was revealed that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries.

Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire.

Animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘impossible to justify medically, ethically or educationally’, but the Ministry of Defence insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare.

And it has also been revealed that more than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009.

The MoD put down 42 British dogs due to a 'dangerous temperament', while 27 developed cancer-related health problems.

The majority, 117 were put down due to 'age and welfare' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis.

Four were killed in action in Afghanistan, and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident.

A spokesperson said the majority of horses are rehomed.

They added: 'Sadly, we sometimes have to put down animals that are in pain, have ­debilitating diseases or are a danger to others.

'That is a last resort, based on veterinary advice.'
