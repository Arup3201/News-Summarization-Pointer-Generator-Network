Documents recovered from an ornamental lake at the extravagant home of Ukraine's fugitive president are being dried out in a sauna in a bid to uncover some of the billions of dollars purported to have gone missing under his kleptocratic regime.

When Viktor Yanukovich fled his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev, hundreds of papers were hurriedly thrown into the water to destroy evidence.

But many were in plastic folders, meaning some documents were still legible and they are now being closely analysed. 

The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project told MailOnline: 'There are some important stories in the documents that show exactly how the government of Ukraine has been operating. 

'I think prosecutors will also find plenty of materials and will investigate money laundering and misuse of government funds.'

Documents recovered from an ornamental lake at the extravagant home of Ukraine's fugitive president are being dried out in the sauna of his guest house in a bid to uncover some of the billions of dollars purported to have gone missing under his kleptocratic regime

When Viktor Yanukovich fled his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev,
hundreds of documents were hurriedly thrown into the water to destroy evidence

According to the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, the documents include 'receipts detailing his [Yanukovich] extravagant spending, financial investments, and lists of press enemies'

Many of the files were in plastic folders, meaning some documents were still legible and are being closely analysed

The people of the country, who earn on 
average earn between £2,400 and £4,200 a year, flocked to see Viktor 
Yanukovich's hastily vacated property last weekend.

A group of volunteer divers discovered the documents had been hastily discarded and retrieved them from the lake at the property which is packed with riches well beyond the reach of a man with an official salary of less than £15,000.

Twenty journalists from a dozen media outlets spent the weekend sorting, separating, and drying the soggy and clumped documents - those that need to are being dried out in the sauna of his guesthouse.

Almost 700 of the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 documents recovered have already been posted online. New documents are being added every hour.

Drew Sullivan, editor at the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project told MailOnline:  'There are about a dozen reporters working on the reporting and they are assisted now by another dozen but many, many more Ukrainians have been giving them food, supplies and more support.  It really is a citizen movement and the people are giving them everything they need but they expect some good reporting in return. 

'They want to know what has really been happening. When they needed scanners, they got between 15 and 20 scanners to get the around 100,000 documents scanned.  That's our latest estimate.  We have five programmers and system people at OCCRP who are also working.  They have designed a site from scratch mostly over a few days.'

A statement published on yanukovychleaks.org reads: 'Volunteer divers found nearly 200 folders of documents at a lake at the residence of former president of Ukraine'

'The recovered documents are being published on this website to make them available to journalists and citizens around the world,' said the group

A statement published on yanukovychleaks.org 
reads: 'Volunteer divers found nearly 200 folders of documents at a lake
 at the residence of former president of Ukraine. They had been thrown 
in the lake to destroy them as people were escaping the compound.

'A
 group of journalists and activists has undertaken to rescue, 
systematize and investigate the enormous wealth of information about the
 former owners of the residence.

'The recovered documents are 
being published on this website to make them available to journalists 
and citizens around the world.

'The investigations based on these documents will also be published here and in Ukrainian media.'

The gates of the secretive and sprawling home were opened to the public after the former president escaped from the capital city and the parliament voted to impeach him.

Sculptures worth millions, statues, a white Steinway piano, gold-plated taps, towel rails and other fixtures, chandeliers everywhere, valuable paintings and elegant glass and tableware. He even had personalised bottles of fine brandy featuring a photo of his smiling face.

The property also boasts a golf course, helicopter pad, cinema room and a garage filled with classic sports cars worth millions, while in the exotic gardens Australian and African ostriches stretched their legs.

Graeco-Roman statues - a Goddess covering her modesty with her hair, lovers intertwined - decorated the lawns. Ornate ponds - half frozen on Saturday - nonetheless bubbled with water being pumped through them. Love-seats and colonnaded meeting places dot the estate.

There is a Russian bath-house and on a hilltop, looking down on the Dnipro river through trees, is a plaza for a barbecue. A replica of a ship also sits on a lake.

Most of the visitors shook their heads in wonderment at the ambitions of a president who had always proclaimed that he was on the side of the poor people of Ukraine.

Today a Swiss prosecutor opened a 
money laundering investigation into Viktor Yanukovich and his son 
Oleksander, the prosecutor's office in Geneva said in a statement on 
Friday.

'A penal 
investigation for severe money laundering is currently being conducted 
in Geneva against Viktor Yanukovich and his son Oleksander,' the 
prosecutor's office said in the statement, adding it had opened the 
probe on Thursday.

New prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk  told parliament that the former government had left the country with $75bn of debts

It 
said prosecutor Yves Bertossa and the police had searched the office of a
 company owned by Oleksander Yanukovich on Thursday morning and seized 
some documents.

Oleksandr, who has amassed a fortune 
measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars in the past three years,
 opened a branch of his company, MAKO, in Geneva in 2011.

This morning Swiss police raided the Geneva offices of Yanukovich firm.

Switzerland said on Thursday it would order banks to freeze any funds in Swiss banks found to be linked any Yanukovich funds.

Yesterday Ukraine's interim authorities officially formed a new government and Ukraine's parliament set about taking measures to recover some of the billions of dollars they say went missing under his regime.

The parliament approved Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a key member of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's party, as prime minister.

He told parliament that the former government had left the country with $75bn of debts.

'Over $20bn of gold reserve were embezzled. They took $37bn of loans that disappeared,' Yatsenyuk said. 

'Around $70bn was moved to offshore accounts from Ukraine's financial system in the last three years,' he claimed.

Today it was announced the Ukraine's central bank will limit foreign currency withdrawals from banking deposits to 15,000 hryvnia ($1,500) per day, to tame hryvnia volatility.

In a bid to shore up Ukraine's fledgling administration, the International Monetary Fund has said it is 'ready to respond' to Ukraine's bid for financial assistance.

The European Union is also considering emergency loans for a country that is the chief conduit of Russian natural gas to western Europe.

Ukraine's finance ministry has said it needs $35 billion over the next two years to avoid default.
