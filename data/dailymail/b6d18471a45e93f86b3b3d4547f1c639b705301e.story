An inspirational cancer sufferer who raised more than £3million has been forced to defend himself against cynical social media trolls after making a partial recovery.

Terminally ill Stephen Sutton from Burntwood, Staffordshire, was able to go home from hospital on Friday after his health improved.

The 19-year-old – who has raised the money for the Teenage Cancer Trust with his deeply moving blogs – welcomed the good news. But a handful of disgruntled donors claimed that they felt ‘conned’ by his recovery.

Cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton's 'thumbs up' posts online have helped him raise £3million for charity

In an appalling reflection of the cynicism of social media, Stephen was forced to defend himself on Twitter yesterday, saying: ‘Sorry to disappoint you! So you know, I still have my cancer and it’s still incurable, if that makes you feel less “duped”.’

Some Twitter users questioned Stephen, with one saying: ‘I see that the almost dead teenager is now making a “recovery” since raising £3.1million. Surprise Surprise.’ Another wrote: ‘I must be a cynic to not believe #stephensstory in its entirety.’

Another user said: ‘#stephensstory err... I’d like refund please?’

And on the Birmingham Mail’s Facebook page, reader Sarah Hill said: ‘Am I the only one who thinks something is not quite right here?  

The 19-year-old's positive attitude has seen him amass thousands of fans around the world, including Prime Minister David Cameron and England footballer Steven Gerrard

‘While I hope I am wrong it feels like we are being conned.

‘One minute he tweets saying he is dying and won’t see the next day, then all of a sudden he is being released to go home. As I said, I hope I am wrong but I have a strange feeling about this.’

Stephen, who has incurable bowel cancer, has won the support of hundreds of thousands of people and a host of celebrities after posting a final ‘thumbs up’ picture and a film about his bucket list of things he would like to do in the time he has left.

When the teenager was told he could leave Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, he wrote: ‘After being at a point where it seemed like I’d never make it out it feels so awesome to be able to put that. The recovery I’ve undergone recently is quite remarkable.

‘This extra period I now have feels like a gift, one that I’m determined to use productively. I’ll probably be straight back to doing some crazy stuff/events/etc soon, but for now, it just feels great to be home!’

Even the Prime Minister has showed his support for Stephen, visiting him in hospital on Friday morning. David Cameron said: ‘He’s amazing, just an inspiration.

‘Anyone who watches his video on YouTube just can’t help but be impressed by his bravery and courage but also his incredible warmth and passion for life. It really is extraordinary.’
