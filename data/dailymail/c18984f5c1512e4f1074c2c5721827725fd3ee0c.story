A farmer whose cattle were spooked by low flying military helicopters has won £2,200 compensation.

The claim is among 824 settled in the past seven years by the Ministry of Defence, now totalling over £9 million.

The compensation went to an anonymous farmer in Wellington, Somerset, for 'injury to cattle and damage to fencing' last May.

Low flying: Chinook helicopters are allowed to fly at only 100 - 500 feet above ground level

Huge twin bladed Chinook helicopters have been blamed for the biggest claims in recent years and farmers unions have been helping individuals to secure settlements for the disturbances.

Two
years ago an Oxfordshire chicken farmer was handed £44,000 compensation
after he complained about a series of low flying incidents.

A Sussex poultry farmer was paid 
£23,000 after terrified chickens were trampled to death while others 
were too traumatised to carry on laying eggs.

South West National Farmers' Union spokesman Ian Johnson said: 'The cows in this instance must have been badly spooked to want to go through barbed wire fencing'. 

Mr Johnson said charging through barbed wire would have resulted in serious injuries to the cattle and that some may have even had to be put down.

He maintained that the farmer was right 
to push for compensation: 'I suspect the farmer was still left out of 
pocket regardless of what they were awarded.'

Low flying training exercises are considered an 
essential skill and MoD has the right to carry out missions between 100 
feet and 500 feet above ground level nationwide.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Incidents of low flying aircraft causing disturbance to farms or businesses are rare and we take any complaints seriously.'
