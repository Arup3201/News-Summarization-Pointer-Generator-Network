Universal Credit is the flagship benefits reform of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith

Benefit changes coming into force this year leave the door open for fraudsters to submit multiple claims on the same house, it as warned today.

The taxpayers already loses £350million a year in housing benefit fraud and MPs today warned plans to combine a raft of handouts into a single payment will see even more public money claimed illegally.

The revelation comes just weeks before ministers start rolling out their flagship Universal Credit designed to dramatically overhaul Britain’s complex welfare system.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has long argued that the single Universal Credit will save money through reduced running costs while making sure that work always pays.

But concerns have been growing about its implementation, with the Communities and Local Government Committee today warning that the vast new IT system will have trouble distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent claims.

Pilots of Universal Credit are due to start this month, and will be implemented nationally from October. It replaces a string of benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.

Councils told the committee they have been raising concerns about fraud for up to three years, but the Department for Work and Pensions has still not found a way to prevent a major source of fraud.

The system will not work from local authority property databases so it will not be able to detect automatically, as local systems did now, when several people made a housing benefit claim for the same property.

Thanet District council warned that 
fraud is a ‘major issue’ in the proposed new system. ‘With the 
veriﬁcation of certain documentation no longer being required this also 
leaves the proposed new system open to fraud,’ Thanet added.

Blackpool council warned a loss of local knowledge will ‘probably lead to an increase in fraud’.

The
committee also raised concerns that  there will be an exodus of 
experienced local authority housing department staff, who will quit due 
to uncertainty over their future prospects, which ‘will leave the system
more open to fraud’.

Chancellor George Osborne yesterday defended the government's benefits changes, insisting they ensure work will always pay

The
committee said the Government must make sure that local authorities 
have the admin funding they need to manage the transition to Universal 
Credit and stop staff leaving prematurely.

Universal
Credit is being introduced in gradual stages over several years, with 
the national rollout following several ‘pathfinder’ pilot projects 
taking place from this month.

Chancellor
George Osborne yesterday defended the government's ambitious reforms, 
insisting it will replace 'all those complicated benefits and tax 
credits with a single, simple Universal Credit which ensures you’re 
always better off working'.

It will be trialled in the North West
of England later this month to 'make sure it’s ready for national roll 
out later this year,' he said in a speech at a Morrisons depot in 
Sittingbourne, Kent.

Mr 
Osborne added :'Be in no doubt: reforming the welfare system is a big 
job, and it’s hard. But I’m proud of what we’re doing to restore some 
common sense and control on costs.

'In
recent days we have heard a lot of, frankly, ill-informed rubbish about
these welfare reforms. Some have said it’s the end of the welfare 
state.

That is shrill, 
headline-seeking nonsense. I will tell you what is true. Taxpayers don’t
think the welfare state works properly anymore.'

However, there are increasing concerns about whether the reforms will work in practice.

Labour MP Clive Betts, chairman of the 
committee, said it was ‘extremely concerning’ that systems to detect 
fraud were still being developed.

He
said: ‘The Government must act to provide assurance that the benefit 
system will not be left vulnerable to fraud either during or after the 
transition. And it must do so urgently.’

The committee said the landmark changes mark the ‘most significant reforms to the welfare system for 60 years’.

The
Government wants to simplify the existing benefits system, so that it 
is easier for claimants to manage their own finances and make the 
transition into work.

Councils warn that the new computer system will not be able to automatically identify if several people are claiming housing benefit on the same house or flat

Under Universal Credit, a single unified benefit payment will take in income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credits, working tax credits and housing benefit.

But the committee also highlighted concerns that the new Universal Credit scheme could result in increased rent arrears as housing support will be paid directly to tenants instead of landlords.

It urged the Government to give a clear definition of the circumstances under which a tenant would be considered ‘vulnerable’, and would therefore have their rent paid directly to the landlord.

The committee also said that the Government should be doing more to raise awareness about the changes and advising claimants to contact their local authority to find out more through advertising.

A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman said: ‘Universal Credit will cut benefit fraud by £200 million a year and we are confident that our IT systems will be strong enough to protect us from the threat of fraud.

‘We have been running pilot projects with local authorities to ensure that those people who can't manage with monthly or direct payments get the support they need.’
