When this dog gets a whiff of his favourite food, not even high kitchen tops and cardboard boxes can stand in his way.

Winston's owner got tired after ten years of food burglary, so set up a hidden camera to catch Winston in action.

Dog's stealing food is a force of habit which can be prevented by training and disciplinary action. Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan recommends four simple steps to stop dogs from stealing food.

By controlling your dogs access to 
food an owner eliminates opportunity which should be followed by 
enforcing a rigorous feeding schedule.

Eliminate unauthorised feeding 
outside of the schedule, such as begging at the table, and show your dog
 that you are the leader of the pack. Â
