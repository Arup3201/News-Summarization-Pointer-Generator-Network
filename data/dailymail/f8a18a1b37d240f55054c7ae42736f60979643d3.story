Dreams have provided an endless source of fascination and inspiration for many a would-be analyser, probably for as long as man has walked the earth.

But the father of a boy with a big imagination has taken the surreal ideas one step further and meticulously recorded his son's fantastic imagination in a photographic project that has taken him six years.

From a UFO hovering over a church, to dinosaurs roaming the countryside, David Niles, 60, has recreated his son Nate's nocturnal meanderings using a range of clever photography tricks and software.

Nighttime adventures: Three tyrannosaurus rex heads tower over Nate, here in the foreground

Extraterrestrial: Three UFOs hover above the earth and Nate looks on as one lights up the church

Octonaut: When Nate dreamed of being an octopus, dad David decided to bring the experience to life

Amphibious: A pod of dinosaurs appear close to the shore, one of which has collected a boat on its head

Low and behold: This is how a herd of flying cows appeared to Nate in one of his dreams one night

Mr Niles, of Paxton in Massachusetts, created the set of photographs after his 10-year-old son told him about the adventures he had been having while asleep at night.

Their conversations marked the start of the six-year project, which began when Nate was just four years old.

Mr Niles said:'I wanted to put my son into his own imaginary world.

'I began putting them together when Nate was four after I was inspired when I watched him playing with his toys, and so the photos are a combination of those two things.

Walking with giants: This diplodocus appeared roaming the countryside during one of Nate's dreams

Boa contstrictor: The appearance of the South American snake may suggest Nate was feeling constrained

Mammoth: In this escapade, Nate got to within touching distance of a wooly mammoth

Prehistoric: Dinosaurs feature heavily in Nate's nighttime imaginings. Here he runs towards flying terrodactyls

Good gourd: Nate wandered across a field to get a closer look at what appears to be a giant pumpkin

'Although Nate hasn't had any direct input into the images, the conversations we've had have contributed to them.

'Often he's imagined fantastic things or described a world he was imagining, such as seeing himself as an octopus or pretending to be a tornado.

'I think that it is important to be able to have an imagination at any age, and I tried to get this across by combining my own ideas as well as Nate's.'

Mr Niles took time to ensure he got the dreams just right, by also using some of the qualities he saw in 19th century photography.

He added:: 'The images were all created with a digital camera, Photoshop, and a little imagination.

'I tend to get a very positive reaction to the photographs. People seem to really enjoy the imaginary quality of the images.'

Flee: Nate turns and runs as the herd of giant wooly mammoths appear in the distance

Tornado: Reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz, Nate sees a house swept up with a woman on a bike and a cow

Perspective: Nate looks back to earth from the moon. It is not clear whether he planted the flag
