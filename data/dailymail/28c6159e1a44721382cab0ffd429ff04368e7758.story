A man has been charged over allegations he defrauded an elderly woman of her house for his personal financial advantage, after watching an episode of A Current Affair

The crooked financier allegedly came to the financial rescue of 82-year-old pensioner Amy Hewitt in 2003, when he heard her horrific story on A Current Affair and offered to pay her mortgage for her, as an act of generosity.

Ms Hewitt appeared on the popular TV show after she was faced with the prospect of losing her house.

The elderly woman was walking to the shops in Bowral, south of Sydney, 11-years-ago, when she slipped on a broken footpath and fell.

The pensioner spent three months in hospital with a fractured wrist and kneecap.

Unable to pay her significant medical bills, the traumatised woman took her local council to court, desperately seeking their assistance.

Unfortunately, her case fell through and she was forced to pay not only her own legal costs, but those of the council as well.

Clearly in financial hardship, it is alleged that Mr Lazar reportedly decided to step in and help Ms Hewitt pay off her debts as an act of kindness.

Ms Hewitt had exhausted all other options and was not only faced with the prospect of paying back an enormous bill to the council but also with losing her $225,000 house.

Known as the man who steps in with financial assistance, when everyone else walks away, Mr Lazar reportedly contacted A Current Affair offering to pay back Ms Hewitt's debt for her and the show put the pair in contact with each other.

However, in 2006 when Ms Hewitt went to sell her home, she discovered the mortgage was no longer registered in her name, and the house had been transferred to a company she had never heard of.

When she contacted Mr Lazar she was told there had been a mix-up and that it would be resolved straight away.

However, he was not true to his word and in 2009 she was evicted from her home.

Ms Hewitt passed away a few years later in a nursing home.

Mr Lazar has been refused bail and will appear before Sydney's Central Local Court on Friday.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis, had some advice for people who have been a victim of fraud.

'Some people feel too embarrassed or scared to report fraud matters to police, but it's vital that we are made aware of what has happened,' he said.

'That way, we can make the necessary inquiries and minimise the chances of other people being targeted and ripped off.'
