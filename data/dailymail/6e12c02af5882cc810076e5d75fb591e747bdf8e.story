China has leapfrogged the United States to become the world’s largest trading nation in a further sign that economic power is shifting from West to East.

The total value of Chinese imports and exports hit $3.87trillion (£2.45trillion) in 2012 – edging past the $3.82trillion (£2.44trillion) trade registered by the US.

It marked another key milestone for the rapidly-growing Chinese economy which is now the second largest in the world behind the US having overtaken Japan.

Analysts said the trade figures were all the more remarkable because although China is catching up fast it is still only half the size of the American economy.

It was seen as an indication of the reliance of Beijing on the rest of the world to generate income compared with America whose economy was twice the size but more self-contained.

‘It is remarkable that an economy that is only a fraction of the size of the US economy has a larger trading volume,’ said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

Growth in global trade slowed sharply last year but China still led the way among the world’s largest economies.

Chinese exports rose 8 per cent in 
2012 following a 20.3 per cent jump in 2011 and 31.3 per cent increase 
in 2010.

By contrast US exports rose 4.4 per cent compared with 16.2 per
cent and 20.5 per cent in the previous two years.

‘It
is clear that China is roaring past the US to take up the baton as the 
key force in driving world trade,’ said Chris Scicluna, head of economic
research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe in London and a former UK 
Treasury official.

Britain exported £10.5billion worth of goods to China last year, up from £9.3billion in 2011 and £7.6billion in 2010, Office for National Statistics show. Exports to the US also rose, from £39.9billion in 2011 to £41billion in 2012.

But sales to Germany fell from £32.6billion to £32.1billion while exports to France dropped from £22billion to £21billion and to Italy from £10billion to £8.1billion.

Jim O’Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who first used the term BRIC to describe the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said China will become an increasingly important trade partner to the West - and could seriously disrupt old alliances in Europe.

‘For so many countries around the world, China is rapidly becoming the most important bilateral trade partner,’ he said. ‘Germany may export twice as much to China by the end of the decade as it does to France.’
