F1 mogul Eddie Jordan has bought a £25million super yacht that is so big it is almost classed as a ship.

The 155ft-long vessel has been commissioned by the 58-year-old and will blow his current 120ft-long boat out of the water.

But it pales in comparison to the Eclipse, the world's largest private yacht.

Owned by Chelsea football club oligarch Roman Abramovich, that vessel is a staggering 536ft-long and cost £272million. It has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine.

But even the Eclipse will soon be 
dwarfed by a yacht currently being built for the Saudi royal family. 
Known only as Project Azzam, it will be 590ft-long and cost £400million.

Still, Mr Jordan can take comfort in 
the fact his yacht will have four decks to house 12 close friends as 
well as ten crew members.

Construction recently began at Sunseeker headquarters in Poole, Dorset, and floor-plans have hinted at what will be contained within.

The sky deck could boast a giant hot tub and bar and the upper deck will feature a luxurious dining area.

An on-board nightclub will be built 
and, after a tiring night of partying, Mr Jordan and his guests will be 
able to relax in the lower deck day-room.

There will be a ‘beach club’ stern 
and ‘panoramic viewing platforms’ down the side, giving guests a front 
row seat for the Grand Prix at Monaco.

The yacht will have an on-board garage complete with small boats and jet skis.

It will cost approximately £30,000 to fill up the super yacht with fuel for her 4,500-mile range.

A team of workers began building the 500-tonne vessel in April. Construction is expected to be finished by December next year.

It will be the largest ever built by 
Sunseeker, a firm that has long been a favourite with F1 drivers 
including Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.

Robert Braithwaite, founder of 
Sunseeker, said: 'She will not be owned by many but those that do will 
be buying a craft of exceptional style, quality and innovation.'

Mr Jordan owns a 120ft vessel named ‘Snapper’, which is currently moored in Monaco.

Now a commentator at the BBC, he is a
 member of the Royal Cork Yacht Club in Ireland and has keen interests 
in extreme sports outside of sailing, including skiing.

Last month, stunned photographers captured images of the Project Azzam vessel as it was transported out of the 170-metre dry dock at the yard of German shipbuilder Lurssen. It had because too large to build inside.

The yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly moved to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers could continue with their work.

Peter Seyfferth, from TheYachtPhoto.com, said: 'The photographers who took the pictures of Azzam were overwhelmed by the size of it.

'It is difficult to say at this stage but I think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then Eclipse.

'There appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there.

'In terms of length, we think it will be around 180-metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships.

'If it has been commissioned for the Saudi Royal Family it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.'

Official details on mega yachts, such as Project Azzam and Mr Abramovich's Eclipse, are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers.

But they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire's flotilla.

It is thought a yacht this size will cost its new owner around £400million - and that is just the initial payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs.

The yacht's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to man it 365 days of the year.

Lurssen, which is building Azzam, has refused to discuss the top secret yacht although rumours in the industry are that is being build for Saudi billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal.

Al-Waleed, 57, is worth around £10billion and a member of the Saudi royal family.

If he is the owner, he is thought to have ordered the new toy as a replacement for his Kingdom 5KR yacht, which he has enjoyed for the past 20-years.

When the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the French Riviera but there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - Monaco and Antibes.
