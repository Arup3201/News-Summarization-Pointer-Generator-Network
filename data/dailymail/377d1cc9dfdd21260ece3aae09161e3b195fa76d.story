As the self-styled lady of the manor, Kelly Hadfield-Hyde may be more accustomed to issuing orders than receiving them.

So when a guard at an airport security scanner asked her to remove her clothing before passing through she took his request a little too literally.

She began to peel off her clothing – only stopping when she had removed her bra.

'Doing what I'm told': The Lady of Alderley told the court she was only following the orders of the security guard

Yesterday Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde, 50, appeared in court charged with causing a disturbance at Manchester Airport.

But the outraged Lady of Alderley told the court she was only following the orders of the security guard.

Magistrates in Trafford saw CCTV footage of the incident which took place in Terminal One of the airport around 6am on December 3.

Hadfield-Hyde and Ann Chadwick, 48, had been due to catch a flight to Malaga along with a friend who was travelling with a young child.

In the footage of them going through security, Hadfield-Hyde and Chadwick appeared to exchange conversation with airport security staff as they took off their coats and belts and placed them on trays.

A minute or so passes before both suddenly begin taking off their clothes, stripping down to their bras before Hadfield-Hyde removes hers.

Hadfield-Hyde told the court that security guard Abdullah Mayet had indicated that she should take off all her clothes before passing through the scanner.

She said: ‘He was pointing at me saying, “Off”. I said to him, “Do you mean just my jacket?”, but he was saying, “Off, off, all off”.’

The court heard that when more airport security staff arrived in an attempt to defuse the situation both women became abusive and swore at them.

Other staff were called to the scene and after a few minutes the women were finally persuaded to put their clothes back on.

Clothes off: Magistrates found mother-of-two Hadfield-Hyde guilty of causing a disturbance and she was handed a £55 fine, ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £850 costs

Claim: Hadfield-Hyde said security guard Abdullah Mayet had indicated that she should take off all her clothes before passing through the scanner

Both women were later arrested and charged with the public order offence of causing a disturbance. Hadfield-Hyde denied she was drunk.

She accused Mr Mayet, who has worked at the airport for five years, of having a poor command of English.

But Mr Mayet said his instructions had been clear and he had never asked the women to strip completely.

Radha Vaithianathar, prosecuting, told Hadfield-Hyde: ‘I do not know what possessed you to take your clothes off but it wasn’t Mr Mayet.’

She claimed Chadwick, from Lytham, Lancashire, had ‘paraded’ herself in front of another passenger.

She pointed out that both had been offered the chance to resolve the matter with a fixed-penalty notice but had insisted on taking it to court.

Mother-of-one Chadwick had initially denied the charge at an earlier hearing but changed her plea to guilty while admitting her actions.

She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Magistrates found mother-of-two Hadfield-Hyde guilty and she was handed a £55 fine, ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £850 costs.

Speaking afterwards, Hadfield-Hyde said: ‘Okay. I took my top off and it was a bit over the top. But I did nothing wrong I just did what I was told.’

Defence: Hadfield-Hyde said she 'did nothing wrong'

Born Nicola Kelly, Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde is former partner of Lord James Hadfield-Hyde, an entrepreneur and portrait painter.

He bought the title more than 20 years ago and the couple lived together in the 18th-century manor house at Willaston, near Nantwich, in Cheshire.

As the salacious ‘Lord Lust’ he appeared on late-night adult TV in the 1990s with a bevy of unclothed models and actresses.

Although unmarried, she changed her name and assumed the manorial title. They were involved in a public falling out in 1991 after Lady Hadfield-Hyde accused him of failing to pay more than £50 a week towards the upbringing of their son.

Lord Hadfield-Hyde angered locals in 2011 by claiming a Royal Charter meant only he, not the council, could grant permission for the local farmers’ market.
