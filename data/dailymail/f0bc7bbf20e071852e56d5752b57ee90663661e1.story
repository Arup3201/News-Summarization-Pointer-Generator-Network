Three hikers had to be rescued as they made a pilgrimage to an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness which was made famous by the book Into The Wild.

The men, two from Wisconsin and a third with no known address, ran into trouble when one of them tripped and hurt himself with an axe, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported.

They needed help from firefighters as they made their way on the Stampede Trail, just north of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve, about 180 miles north of Anchorage.

Matthew Peot, 29, of Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin; Thomas Young, 45, of Horicon, Wisconsin; and Kenneth Young, 
whose age and hometown wasn't listed, had been trying to make their way to the 
dilapidated bus which features in the book and film Into The Wild.

The Tri-Valley Volunteer Fire Department had to rescue the men on all-terrain vehicles, the Alaska State Troopers announced Wednesday on their website.

In an email to The Associated Press, troopers' spokesman Megan Peters said the Teklanika River had been too high for the hikers to cross.

The men then camped for a few days, waiting to see if the river would get low enough to cross, but their quest ended when Young suffered minor injuries in an accident involving an axe.

Authorities are often called to help people heading to the dilapidated bus which features in the book and film, which chronicles the life and death of Chris McCandless.

He hiked into the Alaska wilderness in April 1992 with little food and equipment and spent the summer living in the bus.

McCandless was found dead in the bus almost four months later after starving to death.

Four years ago, a Swiss woman drowned in the river on the trail to the bus, but it was unclear whether she was hiking to the vehicle or just hiking in the area.
