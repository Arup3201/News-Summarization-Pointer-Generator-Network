Justin Rose has given himself a great chance of making it two wins in a row heading into the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool this week.

The popular Englishman posted a wonderful 66 to be tied for  the lead with home hope  Marc Warren going into the final round of the Aberdeen Asset Scottish Open.

Rose arrived at Royal Aberdeen full of confidence following a gutsy victory in his last outing in America’s capital at the Quicken Loans National event, where he prevailed on the first hole of a sudden-death play-off.

That has shown over the first three rounds as the 33-year-old closes in on another success. The only worry for Rose if he wins, of course, would be whether it meant he has peaked too early when it comes to the Claret Jug, for how many players win three events in a row?

Against that, Rose is such a classy and tough competitor these days he might be one of the few who could handle  the expectation.

He showed just how good he has become over the supposedly more difficult back nine, as he mustered no fewer than five birdies to make his statement  of intent.

‘That was as good as I have played all year,’ enthused Rose. ‘I am on a nice little run right now and so the goal now is to keep it going and pull off my first pro win in Scotland.’

Warren however, has every incentive to win himself on what promises to be an intriguing final day as he seeks an afternoon of redemption and make up for the worst day of his professional life in this event two years ago.

Back then, Warren led by three shots with just five holes to go, only to lose to Jeev Milkha Singh from India. ‘At the end of the day I can’t change what happened  but I can dream about making amends and winning it this year,’ said the Scot.

Rose and Warren will begin one shot ahead of little-known Swede Kristoffer Broberg, who does have four Challenge Tour wins to his name. Rory McIlroy recovered from his latest Friday horror show to shoot 68 and stand seven shots back, with defending champion Phil Mickelson a further shot adrift.
