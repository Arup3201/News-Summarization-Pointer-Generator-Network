Father figure: The Most Rev Vincent Nichols will praise the role of fathers in shaping society at a summit of religious leaders today

The head of the Catholic church in England and Wales will call for fathers to be given more recognition for the important role they play in holding society together at a religious summit today.

In a speech in London today, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, will praise fathers for their role in reducing crime rates, helping improve their children's school grades and social behaviour.

He will describe them as Britain's unsung heroes and urge politicians to support fathers at the summit in London to discuss 'family friendly' Government policies.

Rev Nichols will also urge employers to help fathers to support the families by paying them a proper wage.

He is to draw on the experiences he had with his own father and will describe the family unit as the backbone of a successful society.

According to the Daily Telegraph, he will add that the family should be a place where people can expect to be valued as more than 'an anonymous digit by an over-bureaucratic state, a "unit of economic production", or just another consumer or voter'.

He will say: 'Committed, faithful fathers are good for their children - for their educational achievement, psychological well-being and their social behaviour.'

Rev Nichols Will also argue that fathers can shape the way their sons treat women when they grow up.

He will be joined at the summit by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and other religious leaders.

It is being run by campaign group Citizens UK who are to set out the family policies they would like to see pledged at the next general election in their own manifesto.

Family issues have been at the political forefront with the gay marriage debate set to take centre stage in the House of Lords again today.

Prime Minister David Cameron has also been criticised by some members of his party for delaying an election pledge to introduce tax incentives for married couples.
