An eccentric Texas millionaire has been accused of sexually abusing eight teenage boys.

Stanley Marsh 3, who is famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field in the name of art, is facing a raft of lawsuits alleging he supplied the boys with cash, cars and alcohol in return for sexual favours.

The lawsuits also claim the millionaire's wife, Wendy Marsh, and business partner David Weir, knew of the abuse and covered it up.

Mr Weir allegedly went as far as to force the boys to sign a waiver regarding his colleague's behaviour while they were in the office as employees or guests.

Mr Marsh, who inherited his grandfather's oil and gas fortune and previously owned TV station KVII, is set to challenge the claims, which label him as a 'serial abuser' in court, according to The New York Times.

The boys, aged 15, 16 and 17 at the time, are charging sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress and are suing the 74-year-old for unspecified monetary damages.

Amarillo police have interviewed six of the plaintiffs and searched Mr Marsh's offices, removing certain items, as part of a criminal investigation into the alleged abuse.

Mr Marsh's lawyer Kelly Utsinger told The Times his client was cooperating with the police.

'Any suggestions about the truth of these allegations needs to be reserved until the evidence is fully developed,' he said.

'We will file responsive pleadings that challenge and deny these allegations.'

Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s. The bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen song a decade later which only boosted its popularity. He is also known for owning a pig with tattooed wings on its sides.

The city's residents are giving their millionaire neighbour the benefit of the doubt and not letting the allegations taint his mechanic masterpiece.

'I think most people in Amarillo appreciate it as a work of art, and really don't think of it in the context of its donor any more than people concentrate on whatever Van Gogh's psychological problems were in appreciation of his art,' State Senator Kel Seliger, a Panhandle Republican and the cityâ€™s former four-term mayor, told The Times.

'One should always take allegations of indecency with a child seriously. But at this point they are just that, they're allegations.'

But the allegations aren't the first he's faced relating to youngsters.

Nearly 17 years ago, he was arrested on charges of kidnapping and aggravated assault after he was accused of threatening a high school student with a hammer and locking him in a chicken coop. He paid a $4,000 fine and the assault and kidnapping charges were dropped.
