It may seem all glitz and glamour.

But this year's Miss America pageant, held in New Jersey, is marred by family tragedies including homicide, suicide and drug abuse.

Miss Wisconsin is struggling to overcome her 18-year-old brother's suicide - and the revelation that he was addicted to methamphetamine.

Delaware's representative is fighting for the arrest of her sister's killer.

And Miss Kansas is still traumatised by her father's suicide six years ago, which drove her to anorexia. She is now recovered and building her life back together.

The traumatic details emerged as the girls picked the causes they plan to support for the 'public service' section of the contest.

Each contestant will speak at a variety of events to promote their cause and educate others about it.

Since 1989, aspiring Miss Americas have toured the country addressing causes including homelessness, HIV/AIDS prevention, domestic violence, diabetes awareness, character education, and literacy. 

Wisconsin's Raenna Johnson, 24, announced she will be supporting young people battling drug abuse - in tribute to her brother.

'Since his death, I've learned the science of and the effects of meth on the human body,' said Johnson, who hopes for a career in nonprofit development.

'I am adamant about wanting to prevent tragedies like this from happening to other families.'

Miss Delaware Brittany Lewis, 23, will address domestic violence prevention.

Her sister, Gina Nicole Clarke-Lewis, was shot to death in her New Jersey apartment in 2010 in a case that remains unsolved.

She had been in an abusive relationship for five years before her death.

'It took me a long time to come to terms with it,' said Lewis, who grew up in Brigantine, New Jersey, next door to Atlantic City, and hopes one day to host a political television show.

'Being part of the Miss America Organization has given me a voice on being strong and has allowed me to cope and let her memory live on.'

She has visited college campuses to talk to young women about healthy dating relationships and how to recognize the warning signs of potentially abusive situations.

She has also contacted legislators to urge them to keep domestic violence awareness a priority, and she wants to establish shelters for battered women that have a range of social services all under one roof.

Amanda Sasek's platform as Miss Kansas is to help people find their strengths, in memory of her father.

Platforms: The 53 contestants (pictured during their arrival ceremony last Wednesday) will talk about their chosen platforms during the nationally televised pageant finale on Sunday night

'After he committed suicide, I thought the way to handle that was to be so strong that I didn't feel anything anymore, didn't have any emotions,' said Sasek, 23, who hopes to become a university professor of political science and public policy.

She eventually developed anorexia and had to struggle to overcome it. She wants to help others who have lost loved ones through suicide.

'While I don't have my father anymore, I do have the opportunity to change a lot of lives in the process and have a new beginning,' she said.

The contestants will talk about their platforms during the nationally televised pageant finale on Sunday night.

'All 53 contestants every year have something that motivates them toward their area of community service,' said Sam Haskell, CEO of the Miss America Organization. 

'The catalyst is usually something personal. I find it incredibly empowering for the contestants to talk about their issues. Through their own tragedies, they want to help others.'
