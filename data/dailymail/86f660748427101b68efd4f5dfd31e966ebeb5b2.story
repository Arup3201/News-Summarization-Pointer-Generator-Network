A dental therapist who was diagnosed with skin cancer has decided to chart her life by taking a picture every day.

Janet Holden, 41, started uploading the images - sometimes moving, sometimes funny - onto the internet a year ago.

She originally planned to continue the project for 365 days to mark a new chapter in her life after getting divorced and turning 40, but after receiving a positive feedback she decided to continue taking and publishing the pictures.

Brave: Janet Holden, from Accrington, Lancs., decided to chart her daily life through photography every day for a year after she was diagnosed with skin cancer

Jumping for joy: From her trips to the beach to interesting meals she has eaten, Janet was determined to record the lighter moments in her life

Eye catching: Janet's reflection can be seen on a friend's pupil, one of more than 300 snaps has shared on website Blipfoto

Green and pleasant land: Janet took a six-hour bike trip spanning Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria, which according to her entry, was 'worth the numb bum'

She published photos of her daily life on sharing site Blipfoto and has built up an international following.

The 41-year-old amateur photographer from Accrington, Lancashire, said: 'Sometimes it was hard to come up with a good photo each day and I fell back on taking pictures of food or flowers.

'I ended up setting a reminder on my phone so I wouldn’t forget to take one because maintaining it for a whole year was a challenge.'

Ms Holden, who is recovering from basal cell carcinoma, which is a superficial, non malignant form of skin cancer, said the task had been a welcome distraction.

Quirky: From indecently-attired mannequins, left, to a friend's chicken who was given a towel down after getting drenched in the rain, her photo diary is a constant source of entertainment

Beautiful scene: Janet passes the time by capturing this gorgeous sunset

Warming: Ill with the 'flu on December 30 last year, Janet posts a picture of her grandma's remedy - honey and lemon tea, washed down with a couple of pills

'It’s a project that has helped me 
come through some tough times that I have had over the last year and I 
enjoyed it so much that it’s not something that I’m ready to give up,' she said.

'By
publishing the photos on the internet, I’ve been able to share my world
with other people and also see theirs which is a great experience.

'It’s nice to receive the feedback on the photos and I can’t believe that people care about my "boring life".

'I’ve enjoyed taking pictures of more interesting things like food, with my recent trip to Devon and Cornwall standing out.

'Blipfoto’s tagline is ‘save your life’ which I think it particularly fitting for me.'

Favourite haunt: Janet posted this picture on June 29 of this cavernous off licence, which she described as being like Aladdin's Cave

Gruesome: Dental therapist Janet show's off the unsavoury side of her job - a filter with the contents of patients' mouths at the end of a long day

Apt: The tagline of the photosharing website she uses, Blipfoto, is appropriately called 'save your life'
