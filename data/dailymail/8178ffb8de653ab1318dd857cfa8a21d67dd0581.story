Home ownership will become a 'distant' dream for an entire generation, with just one in five under-35s able to buy a house by the end of the decade, Labour claims today.

A dramatic slump in property ownership among the young from 60 per cent to 20 per cent in a generation means a record number of people in their twenties and thirties are still living with their parents.

Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds warns five more years of the Tories' 'failed plan' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent.

By 2020, just 21 per cent of under-35s will own their own home if the current trend continues, according to Labour. In 1991 the figure was 60 per cent

Latest figures show that just 31 per cent of people aged 16-35 owned their own home in 2012-13, down from 10 per cent in the year before the last election.

Labour warns that if the trend continues, it will mean that by 2020 just 21 per cent of young people will be on the property ladder.

In a speech today, Miss Reynolds will say: 'Over the past five years, David Cameron has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peace time since the 1920s.

'For a whole generation of young people and families the aspiration of buying their own home is becoming a distant dream.

'A record number of young people are still living at home with their parents in their twenties and thirties because they can't get on the housing ladder.'

In 2001 more than half of under-35s (55 per cent) owned their home, and in 1991 it was as high as 60 per cent.

At the same time, the proportion of over-75s owning a property has risen from 53 per cent in 1991 to 76 per cent in 2012-13.

In a speech to the Town and Country Planning Association, Miss Reynolds will set out how Labour would try to reinvigorate the aspiration of home ownership.

Overall, just 63 per cent of people own their own home, the lowest level since the mid-1980s.

Labour claims that if the trend continues it will reach the lowest level for 40 years.

'After five years of empty announcements and failed initiatives the Tories are offering more of the same,' Miss Reynolds will say.

'But they can't even say how their latest pie-in-the-sky scheme will work or how they will pay for the £8.6 billion cost of the supposed 20 per cent discounts that are on offer.

'Five more years of the Tories' failed plan will see a growing housing gap, falling home ownership and unrealised aspiration for the next generation.'

She will promise that Labour has a plan to build 200,000 homes every year by 2020.

A Labour government would make tackling the housing crisis a 'national priority', giving communities stronger powers to build homes.

First time buyers would be given priority access rights in new 'Housing Growth Areas' while small builders will be given more support.

Overall, just 63 per cent of people own their own home, the lowest level since the mid-1980s, according to the English Housing Survey

Labour is also promising a new generation of New Towns and Garden Cities. 

Miss Reynolds will pledge that Labour will recreate the post-war spirit of house building.

'Labour has developed the first comprehensive plan for a generation to tackle the housing crisis. A Labour Government will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 but we won't stop there.

'The next Labour Government will recapture the post-war spirit for building new homes and match that renewed ambition with a drive to build high quality homes and great places for new communities.

'While the Tories still believe, despite their failure over the past five years, that the housing crisis will be solved by the market alone, Labour is clear that to tackle the housing crisis there must be a much more active role for national and local government.'
