The Milky Way was recently believed to have a mass three trillion times bigger than that of our sun.

But now scientists have discovered that our Milky Way is lighter than previously thought - with just 800 billion solar masses.

This means it has about half the mass of one of its closest neighbours, the Andromeda galaxy, 2.5 million light years away.

The Milky Way is seen here above the dome of the Danish 1.54-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Scientists have discovered that the Milky Way, the galaxy containing the sun and its family of planets, is lighter than was previously thought

Both are similar types of spiral galaxy and the largest in a clump of 54 galaxies known as the 'Local Group'.

Scientists believe Andromeda's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity.

The galaxy, which is about the same size as the Milky Way, is believed to contain twice as much dark matter as our galactic home.

Previous studies were only able to measure the mass enclosed within the galaxies' inner regions. The new study included the mass of outer region invisible matter.

Scientists believe Andromeda's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity. At approximately 2.5 million light-years away, the Andromeda galaxy, or M31, is our Milky Way's largest galactic neighbour

Data on the known distances between galaxies in the Local Group were used to calculate the total masses of Andromeda and the Milky Way.

The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars.

This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars.

On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created.

Based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way could have a supermassive black hole.

The findings, from a team led by Dr Jorge Penarrubia at the University of Edinburgh, appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Dr Penarrubia said: 'We always suspected that Andromeda is more massive than the Milky Way, but weighting both galaxies simultaneously proved to be extremely challenging.

They researchers believe their work should help them learn more about how the outer regions of galaxies are structured. 

'Our study combined recent measurements of the relative motion between our galaxy and Andromeda with the largest catalogue of nearby galaxies ever compiled to make this possible.' 

Although both galaxies appear to be of similar dimensions, until now scientists had been unable to prove which is larger. 

Dr Penarrubia told MailOnline: 'We don’t understand at all what dark matter might be and there are many theories.

'What are research could do is help explain more about how this elusive material behaves.'

The Milky Way is 800 billion more massive than our sun, study claims

@highlight

This means it has half the mass of the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy

The extra weight may be down to the existence of elusive dark matter

Work could help reveal how the outer regions of galaxies are structured

It could also shed light on the possible form and existence of dark matter
