Men and women are being segregated at universities as academics bow to the beliefs of extremist Islamic speakers.University authorities are allowing the separation of sexes in fear of infringing the rights of the firebrands.In most cases, women are made to sit at the back of rooms but in some instances they have been made to sit in a separate room and watch proceedings on screens via a live feed.

Anger: Protesters hold up placards rejecting 'gender apartheid' outside the headquarters of Universities Uk in London last night after their guidelines agreed that women and men can be segregated

Anger: The segregation by sex at university talks by visiting speakers has been called discrimination and those concerned say decision will take Britain backwards

Out of 180 visits by extremists 
monitored over a 12-month period, a quarter – or 46 – at 21 institutions
 were found to have promoted segregation by gender. Six of these events 
were cancelled, usually after complaints from students.

The astonishing practice was unearthed by Student Rights, a group set up to monitor extremism on university campuses.

It
 said security staff at one debate organised by the Islamic Education 
and Research Academy at University College London ‘tried to physically 
remove members of the audience who would not comply’ with a sexual 
segregation policy.

The practice is effectively supported by 
Universities UK, an umbrella organisation that speaks on behalf of 132 
British universities. Its guidance says that failing to segregate men 
and women might breach ‘the freedom of speech of the religious group or 
speaker’.

Action: University College London has banned one Muslim group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation

Greek Islamic convert Hamza Andreas Tzortzis was a speaker at the debate at UCL, his spokesman said earlier this year that segregation was informal

Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons education select 
committee, branded the guidance ‘nonsense’ yesterday and demanded that 
it be reviewed. ‘Segregation by sex is completely unacceptable in a 
publicly-funded institution,’ he said.

Keith Porteous Wood, of the 
National Secular Society, accused universities of betraying the 
‘hallowed principles of freedom of expression’ by ‘succumbing to demands
 from speakers, generally those trying to undermine universal human 
rights’.

Student Rights, which describes extremism on campuses as ‘an
 increasingly worrying trend’, looked at all visits by extremist 
speakers in the 12 months to March. Director Raheem Kassam said 
segregation forced ‘cultural practices’ on to people on a public campus.

‘It
 is disgraceful that this can happen in a modern and equal society,’ he 
said. ‘If we’re going to make concessions like this then where does it 
stop? Should we segregate people by race?’

Students have been protesting outside the London headquarters of Universities UK this week over its stance.

The
 issue provoked a furious exchange between Muslim newspaper columnist 
Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Omar Ali, of the Federation of Student Islamic 
Societies, on Channel 4 News.

Worries:
 Leicester University spoke of its concerns over photos showing 
hand-written signs requesting that male and female students sat in 
separate areas at a public talk by the university’s Islamic Society

Mrs Alibhai-Brown described it as a 
‘disaster for feminism, university life and progressive ideals’. ‘You 
can do what you like in mosques and temples,’ she said. ‘These are 
meetings by fundamentalists telling women to get out of the public 
space.

‘You are using democracy,  freedom, the great rights, to 
fundamentally destroy these very rights. Don’t use our universities to 
impose these Saudi Arabian practices.’

Mr Ali dismissed ‘segregation’
 as ‘an emotive use of language’. ‘If a society is set up to cater for 
religious needs on campus, why shouldn’t they?’ he said. ‘A lot of 
people would find it insulting to say this is something discriminatory 
against women.’

A Universities UK spokesman said its guidance ‘does 
not promote gender segregation’ and allows universities to make 
decisions ‘on a case by case basis’.

‘It includes a hypothetical case
 study involving an external speaker talking about his orthodox 
religious faith who had requested segregated seating areas,’ said the 
spokesman.

‘It concluded that if neither women nor men were 
disadvantaged and a non-segregated seating area also provided, a 
university could decide it is appropriate to agree to the request.’
