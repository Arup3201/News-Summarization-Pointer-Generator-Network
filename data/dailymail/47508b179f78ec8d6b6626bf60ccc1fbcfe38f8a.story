There is confusion over who developed a new computer super-virus after some programmers today reportedly said the coding was the same relatively simple language as found in video games like Angry Birds.

The suggestion contradicts theories put forward by other experts who only yesterday said the virus, known as The Flame, was so sophisticated it had to have been developed by some of the world's top brains at the U.S.'s National Security Agency.

To guard against the virus the United Nations is issuing its 'most serious warning', but now some say element of the virus - known as malware -  are baffling.

Simplistic: Experts have today raised question marks over the sophistication of new computer bug Flame, saying sections of the code used to produce it are the same as that used in video games like Angry Birds

According to msnbc reporter Bob Sullivan the program requires 20 megabytes - a comparably large size for a computer virus and an indicator of sluggish coding.

Furthermore unlike the computer bug Stuxnet, Flame has so far failed to make a security breach comparable to hacking into a nuclear power plant.

Most notably sections of the code were used the Lua programming language which is almost whollly used to create video games such as the hugely popular Angry Birds.

Warnings have previously been put out claiming that the virus has the capability to cripple nations and the bug has been used to hack into computers in Iran.

The sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most malicious software – also hacked other machines in the Middle East, including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Egypt.

Lua, which was developed in Brazil, is generally considered to be a simple computer language, developed for the primary purpose of scripting video games.

According to an Israeli programmer, quoted by msnbc, it was 'weird' to imagine the Lua language being used as a tool for spying. He said the code was so 'ordinary' it looked like the efforts of an 'average programmer'.

The language was named Lua after the Portuguese word for moon and reflects the idea of it being used as a subsidiary form of coding to attach satellite projects to bigger bits of software.

Marcus Carey, who worked as a security analyst at the National Security Agency for eight years, said Lua was quite commonly used to power mobile applications such as Angry Birds.

Mr Carey dismissed suggestions that the virus had been released by a government to spy on other nations.

However, this view is contradicted by those such as Moscow-based 
internet security firm Kaspersky Lab ZAO who has claimed that Flame was crafted at the 
behest of a national government.

Finger-pointing in Israel's direction, fuelled by the fact that the majority of cases so far discovered were in Iran, have not been strongly disputed as yet, but some believe the middle-east nation lacks the capacity to launch such an cyber attack.

The argument appears to boil down to two schools of thought.

Some say Flame's authors were being exceedingly clever by using an unusual programming language to develop a deadly piece of malware in an attempt to confuse hi-tech security systems.

Others say those behind the superbug were amateurs who did little to do much to cover their tracks.
