Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said he wanted to keep the 'menace' of high-risk offenders off the road

The chances of a pedestrian being killed or seriously injured varies dramatically according to what part of the country they are in, it emerged yesterday.

In some areas, the risk is nearly three times greater than in others, leading to what campaigners have described as a ‘deadly postcode lottery’.

The most dangerous areas are Merseyside, the West Midlands and Lancashire, with 14 deaths per 100,000 people.

For those who live in Warwickshire and Suffolk, however, the number is 5 per 100,000, or fewer.

According to Department for Transport data from 2011 – the most recent available – a total of 5,907 pedestrians were killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads.

Yet while politicians have pointed to an overall reduction in road deaths, the number of pedestrian casualties is on the increase.

Phillipa Hunt, of the campaign group Living Streets, said the ‘deplorable 6 per cent increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions’ is a ‘shocking reflection of the state of pedestrian safety in Britain’.

The reasons for the large variation are not clear. Some variation according to the density of population might be expected, but some areas with similar geography have very different rates.

The metropolitan area of Greater Manchester is markedly safer than the most dangerous postcodes.

London, with far and away the largest number of vehicles on the road, comes in at number five on the list – with pedestrians 10 per cent safer than in Merseyside.

The shock figures have led to calls for a total overhaul of the Government’s approach.

Living Streets’ Director of Policy and Communications, Phillipa Hunt, said: ‘These figures are a shocking reflection of the state of pedestrian safety in Britain.

'We are all pedestrians and should be able to walk on our streets safely regardless of where we live.

'The deplorable 6% increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions, reported last month, calls for bold and proven measures at both national and local level.’

Amy Aeron-Thomas, the director of Roadpeace, said: ‘Britain’s poor pedestrian record is well-known but it is shocking to learn just how variable it is across the country.

'Walking is the basic travel mode for the most vulnerable in our society. They deserve extra protection not extra risk.

‘If the police treated road crime as real crime they would make it a priority to better understand the crashes and casualty rates on their streets. This is essential for the prevention of road crime and the protection of life, the key aim of policing.’

The authorities have also been criticised for failing to collate the data themselves. The research was compiled by an independent statistician, Ian Campbell, who was alarmed by the lack of a coherent approach to road safety in the UK, which he described as a ‘policy vacuum’.

No monitoring of rates by police area is carried out by the Department for Transport, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Local Government Association or Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary.

Mr Campbell said: ‘The total number of casualties has been falling for years, and this is often referred to by those in authority. But have roads really got safer?

‘We don’t know how much of the fall is due to pedestrians being scared to travel on foot and so walking less; or how much it is due to car manufacturers making their cars safer for the drivers.

‘There does not seem to have been a review of all the evidence. So should those in authority be claiming any credit for declines that have occurred?

‘They collect information relating to car crime, but this is about theft, not the very real risk of death or serious injury.’

Campaigners have long been calling for a blanket 20mph limit in built up areas, pointing to evidence that this reduces child pedestrian deaths by 70 per cent.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Britain has some of the safest roads in the world but we know that one death is one too many.

‘Local councils have the knowledge and experience needed to manage their roads effectively and to help them do this we have published new guidance on how to implement speed limits as well as making it easier for them to introduce 20 mph zones where this is appropriate.

‘To help further reduce casualties we are taking action to streamline enforcement of drink driving and have proposed an increase in the fixed penalty for using a mobile at the wheel as well as measures to make easier for the police to enforce against careless drivers. 

‘We are also continuing to run our award winning THINK! road safety campaigns and are working with schools and local councils to make sure important road safety messages are reaching children and teenagers to help them stay safe.’
