A judge set bail at $1.4million on Wednesday for a Wisconsin father accused of killing his three young sons in a house fire which he allegedly set last week.

Armin Wand III, 32, of Argyle, Wisconsin, faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide, three counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and one count of arson in connection with the fire.

Lafayette County Circuit Judge William D. Johnston set his bail at $200,000 per count.

Grave charges: Armin G. Wand III, 32, left, and his brother Jeremy L. Wand, 18, are accused of starting a house fire that killed Armin Wand's three young sons and injured his wife

Investigators have accused Armin Wand III’s brother, Jeremy Wand, 18, of helping with torching the residence. He faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide, two counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and one count of arson.

The judge set his bail at $200,000 per charge as well for a total cash bond of $1.2million.

A criminal complaint states that Jeremy Wand, at the direction of his brother, locked two of his nephews in their rooms after setting the fire around 3am on Friday. 

Armin Wand gave conflicting reports to investigators about whether the boys could be heard yelling as the fire progressed. An autopsy later found all three children died of smoke inhalation

According to the criminal complaint, Armin Wand lived in a rental house in Argyle, a village of 850 people about 45 miles southwest of Madison, with his wife, Sharon Wand, 27, and their four children.

He told state agents in an interview he started talking with his brother early last week about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies.

Wand told the agents he wanted to make
a 'fresh start', the complaint said. He said he was tired of his family 
living paycheck to paycheck and listening to his wife’s complaints about
wanting more money. She also was contemplating divorce, he said.

Jeremy
Wand told investigators his brother offered him $300 from the insurance
payout if he helped him, the complaint said. Together they set the 
house on fire early Friday morning as the rest of the family slept, the 
complaint said.

The couple’s three boys, seven-year-old Allen, five-year-old Jeffrey and three-year-old Joseph died in the blaze.

Sharon Wand, who was 17 weeks pregnant, woke up and rescued her two-year-old daughter, Jessica. When she handed the girl to Armin Wand III he tried to put her back in the house through a broken window, the complaint said. A woman stopped him before he could do it, though.

The girl wasn’t seriously hurt, but Mrs Wand suffered burns, the complaint said. A beam also fell on her, and her unborn baby died as a result of her injuries, the children’s grandmother told the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper.

Sharon Wand remains in a Madison hospital in critical condition with third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body.

Johnston ordered both Armin Wand III and his brother to have no contact with Sharon and Jessica Wand if they post bail. He set a preliminary hearing for both men for November 13.
