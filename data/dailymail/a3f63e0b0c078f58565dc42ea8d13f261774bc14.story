Two siblings who shot to fame when a home movie of their exuberant unwrapping of a computer console for Christmas went viral on the internet have recreated their famous celebration 15 years on.

Brandon and Rachel Kuzma, who were aged nine and six at the time, punched the air and screamed with joy when they realised they had received a Nintendo 64 on Christmas Day in 1998.

But little did they know that the video, shot by their father at their childhood home in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, would make them internet stars.

Now the pair have posed for a photo after a U.S. television station reporter wondered on air what became of the two siblings who were synonymous with the joy of receiving Christmas gifts.

Both now live in New York City, where Brandon, 24, works as a freelance filmmaker, and Rachel, 21, is studying photography at the International Center for Photography as part of a program at Ringling College of Art and Design, according to Today.com.

But their Christmas Day celebration is still a hit with internet users, even after all these years.

One viewer commented a few days ago: 'Wow. This just became one of my favorite videos on YouTube.'

While another commenter pondered on what makes a funny family video become such an internet sensation, adding: 'Very few of us would have ever imagined that the silly family videos would end up traveling all around the internet years later.

'I remember always saying "dude, why are your parents filming this? no one ever watches home videos!" Boy was I wrong!'

Festive feeling: The siblings Rachel, 21, and Brandon, 24, have recreated this famous scene from their Christmas home video
