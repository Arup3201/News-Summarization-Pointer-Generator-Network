Four children from the same family have been killed in a house fire in Texas despite their father's desperate attempts to smash through a window and save them from the flames.

Firefighters received a callout to a home in Spurger, east Texas, about 2.30am on Wednesday, to discover four children were stuck inside the burning home.

The four children - all aged between four and eight - died in the fire, while their parents Amanda and Jimmy Loftin and two other children survived.

Mr Loftin refused treatment at the scene, while his partner and the two surviving children were taken to hospital to be treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation.

The children's great aunt Kathy Marshall told Abc13: 'Jimmy frantically tried to do what he could to get to the children.

'He busted a window out. And when he busted the window out the fire came through severely burning his face has hands and his back.'

When firefighters arrived at the scene, the four had already died and their bodies were found inside. They were eight-year-old Koltyn, 6-year-olds Kyi'leigh and Haven, and Dycin, aged 4.

Mrs Marshall said the whole family was asleep when the fire started in a room of the mobile home, but they woke up because it was becoming unbearably hot.

When firefighters arrived at the blaze, it was too late - the bodies of four children were found inside the home

The children's cousin Harli Wilson said: 'When my sister came and woke me up this morning, and she said "I don't know how I'm going to tell you this without crying, but there was a fire at Amanda's house and four of the kids didn't make it," my body went into shock,' 12NewsNow reported.

The two children to survive the blaze wereÂ Kayann, 2, and 5-month-old Thomas. They were both sleeping in the same room as their parents.

The Texas State Fire Marshals office is working to establish how the fire started, while counselors have been made available at a nearby school that was attended by the children.
