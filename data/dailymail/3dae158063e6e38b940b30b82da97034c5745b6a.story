A baby born with an incredibly weak heart was nicknamed the ‘navy blue baby’ by nurses.

Ben Maly’s heart was so weak it couldn’t pump blood around his body,effectively causing him to turn blue.

But, after four open heart operations, he is now thriving. 

Ben Maly, six months old, is thriving after four open heart operations. He was born with such a weak heart that his skin turned blue. He is pictured with his sister, Lilly, and parents Carrie Redfern and Graham Maly

When Ben, now six months old, was born his heart stopped working for 15 minutes and 'amazing' medics at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool had to fight to restart it.

His mother, Carrie Redfern, 31, of Worsley, Manchester, said: ‘Nurses said it was a miracle that he is still with us. We honestly thought we had lost him.

‘Fingers crossed he is fully fixed now. He is pink, he is warm and he is full of beans.

‘The team at Alder Hey were absolutely amazing and they saved our baby's life. We want to say thanks for everything they have done.’

Ben was born with a congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot - or Blue Baby Syndrome.

He had multiple problems including narrowed arteries and holes in his heart.

Doctors say it is a miracle that Ben survived. At one point his heart stopped for 15 minutes and medics had to battle to save his life

Ben's family wants to thank all of the doctors and nurses at Alder Hey Children's Hospital who they say saved his life. They are now raising money for the hospital's cardiac unit

Following his first operation he stopped breathing for 15 minutes and had to be revived.

But after a fourth operation in February, to close a second large hole, he is now doing well.

Ms Redfern and partner Graham Maly, 39, who are also parents to eight-year-old Lilly, are now organising an amateur golf day and black tie dinner to raise money for the Liverpool hospital's cardiac surgical fund.

Tetralogy of Fallot is a group of four structural abnormalities within the heart that occur together.

These are:

Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease.

Babies with the condition will need surgery to correct their heart abnormalities.

Before surgery, they often appear blue and are prone to fainting.

About 98 per cent of children with the condition survive and go on to have a good quality of life.
