He hasn't yet appeared on the family's famous TV show, but Prime Minister David Cameron is actually a long-lost Kardashian, new research has found.

The Tory leader is the 13th cousin of reality star Kim, according The Global Family Reunion, a project that hopes to show how the whole of humanity is distantly related.

The connection is not quite close enough to see the PM star alongside Kim's sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but genealogists say that the Cameron and Kardashian lines do cross on a large enough family tree.

The pair are just one of a number of unlikely celebrity connections, which also show that the Queen is eleventh cousins, four times removed, with socialite Paris Hilton, and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is the 20th cousin of pop star Prince.

The big link-up: Research has shown that we are all related, as these celebrity connections show

George
 Clooney, Prince and George Bush Snr are just a few of the other celebrities 
who can now call each other family thanks to project - which now encompasses 77 million people.

Project organiser AJ
 Jacobs, a New York author who describes himself as 'your cousin', is 
asking people to join his campaign and discover their own famous 
relatives.

He told MailOnline: 'I got into the idea after a man contacted me out of the blue after reading one of my books and told me that he had worked out that we were related.

'I was expecting him to ask me to wire $10,000 into his bank account but in fact he told me of a movement of people who are putting together these huge family trees.'

Using genealogy websites that, similarly to Wikipedia, are reliant on users' input, Mr Jacobs and his group now aim to build a family tree of the entire human race.

As well as the Kardashian-Cameron 
connection, which links to the 17th Century Welsh politician, the 4th 
Baronet of Margam, Sir Edward Mansel, Mr Jacobs has discovered he is 
'cousins' with a number of famous people.

The Queen, right, and U.S. socialite Paris Hilton are 11th cousins, four times removed, according to the tree

He said: 'I've contacted a number of people I've found out I'm related to, including Daniel Radcliffe, George HW Bush and Ricky Gervais.

'They are often amazed when I tell them all the other people they are connected to. Daniel Radcliffe was pleased to hear he is related to poet Allen Ginsberg, who he once played in a movie, and George Bush was happy when I told him he is related to George Clooney, who is he a big fan of.'

The validity of some family connections is questionable and Mr Jacobs has said he is skeptical of the links when there are more than 50 people involved.

But he hopes that the project will send out a message that everyone is related to everyone else.

He said: 'It may sound a bit corny, but I hope for the first time in history we realise we are actually one massive family and perhaps we'll start treating each other with a bit more respect.'

A celebration of The Global Family Reunion will be held in June next year on the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair, now home to the New York Hall of Science.

There will presentations, activities and speeches - and what Mr Jacobs hopes will be the largest family photo in history.
