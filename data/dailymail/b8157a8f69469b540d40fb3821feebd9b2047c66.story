Brendan Rodgers has expressed his deep disappointment that Lazar Markovic has been given a four-match ban and described the punishment as 'harsh'.

The Liverpool midfielder was sent-off against Basle in the final Champions League game in December for an innocuous hand flick but UEFA only revealed his punishment yesterday.

It means Liverpool will be without Markovic for both legs of their Europa League last 32 contest against Besiktas and, potentially, both legs of the last 16 also and it a suspension that his manager believes is unjust.

'We are obviously disappointed with the length of the ban,” said Rodgers. 'We felt it was very harsh but we accept it and unfortunately he won’t be able to contribute. Hopefully he will play many more European games for the club.'

Rodgers, whose side are enjoying their best run of form of the campaign, is relishing the chance to get back into European competition and is not in the least bit concerned about a reunion with Demba Ba, the striker who blew a hole in their quest to win the Barclays Premier League when he played for Chelsea.

'It won’t stimulate any bad memories for me. He scored a goal. We will pay him respect but nothing more than that.” said Rodgers.

'He has been a very good player and had a fruitful period in England - a wonderful player who scores goals and he has done well at Besiktas.' Daniel Sturridge, meanwhile, is determined to carry on building his fitness up and sees this game as an opportunity to continue his momentum.

'Every competition is important for us. We take each game as it comes. We will play our football and look to get good results,' said Sturridge.

'I have got no worries, no stresses at all. I am enjoying my football and if selected I will continue to do my best for the team.

'It is important to get a relationship with every player, whether it is Mario, Simon Mignolet or whoever. I am just doing my best to help the team. I look forward to continuing playing between now and the end of the season.

'I think the setup is different but the mentality is always the same. We are going in with that mentality and it is important for us as a team. That is what will bring us success in the future.

'It is easy to play with Mario and any of my team-mates. I feel like I can play him or anybody, it is up to the manager. I like Mario and I will do my best to help the team.'

Of the challenge Besiktas and Ba present, Sturridge added: 'I know they are a good side from watching the videos. I don't see them every week but I know that it is a good game for us, very difficult. It will be a great game for everybody in the stadium.

'He has got a good goalscoring record from his time in England. But we are not trying to concentrate on individuals. We are just going to play the Liverpool way.'

The duo admitted there will be no hard feelings towards former Chelsea striker Demba Ba on Thursday night
