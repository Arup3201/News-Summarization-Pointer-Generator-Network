A funeral has been held in Madrid for the Spanish missionary priest who became Ebola's first European victim as it emerged another leading physician has been claimed by the disease.

Miguel Pajares, 75, died five days after being airlifted from Liberia - where he was involved in treating patients suffering from the disease - to receive expert care in the Spanish capital.

It comes as reports emerge that the chief doctor treating Ebola in Sierra Leone, Sheik Humarr Khan, had come down with the disease but colleagues decided against giving him the treatment ZMapp. He died days later.

The current epidemic has so far killed more than 1,000 people - including several leading physicians - and has hit Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, as well as Liberia.

Now experts warn Kenya is the next country in danger of an outbreak.

The country has been placed on the World Health Organization's list of countries considered at 'high risk' of an Ebola outbreak.

Kenya is considered to be at particular risk because it is a major transport, with a large number of flights from West Africa arriving in the country every day, a WHO official said.

The warning is the most serious yet that the deadly disease could spread to East Africa.

News that Kenya is now considered at 'high risk' of an Ebola outbreak came as a top African doctor suffering from the disease had been considered for an experimental drug treatment, but did not receive it before he died.

Despite the huge number of Ebola deaths and infections in West Africa, only Mr Parajes and two Americans have so-far received an experimental anti-Ebola medication called ZMapp.

Although the drug did not save Mr Parajes' life, it has been credited with the 'miraculous' recovery of two American aid workers.

Doctors considered giving 
ZMapp to Sheik Humarr Khan, the chief doctor treating Ebola in Sierra 
Leone, but eventually decided against it, World Health Organization 
officials claimed.

WHO then tried to airlift Khan out of the
 country, but 'his condition had deteriorated too much to be transported
 safely' and he eventually died on July 29.

Doses
 of ZMapp for two Liberian doctors could arrive as soon as Wednesday in 
Liberia, according to Health Minister Walter Gwenigale. They would be 
the first Africans known to receive the treatment.

The
 California-based company that makes the drug, Mapp Pharmaceuticals, has
 said that its supplies are now exhausted, and it would take several 
months to make even a modest amount.

Canada
 announced yesterday it would donate 800 to 1,000 doses of its 
experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of 
Canada to the World Health Organization.

'The
 trouble is, of course, with this very, very limited number of vaccines,
 who would you give that to?' said Dr. Gregory Taylor, deputy head of 
the agency.Â

Meanwhile, yet 
another doctor in Sierra Leone, Modupeh Cole, died today, according to 
Sidie Yayah Tunis - director of communications for the Ministry of 
Health and Sanitation.

Cole, trained in the U.S. and was one of the top doctors working in the 
Ebola isolation ward in Connaught Hospital in Freetown, the capital.

He
 tested positive for the disease last week and was transferred to the 
eastern district of Kailahun, where Doctors Without Borders is running a
 treatment center.

Cole's
 sickness spread fear throughout the hospital where he worked, and staff
 there went on strike Friday and Saturday after learning that he had 
tested positive for the deadly disease.

They returned to work on Sunday.

Both
 Cole's and Khan's deaths are a major blow to Sierra Leone's health 
system, which is struggling to cope with the deadly outbreak.

Transport: The missionary priest was flown back to Spain for treatment after he tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus. He had been forced to make the journey inside a small isolation chamber

The
 outbreak, which was first identified in March in Guinea, has strained 
the resources of the poor West African countries it has hit and of the 
international community, which is struggling to mobilize enough 
qualified doctors.

Today the German government is calling on its citizens to leave the west African countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia because of the Ebola epidemic.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said Wednesday that this appeal did not apply to urgently needed medical workers or to diplomatic staff.

Meanwhile Guinea-Bissau has decided to close its frontier with eastern neighbour Guinea in a bid to prevent the entry of the deadly Ebola virus, Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira said.

There is no known cure or licensed treatment for Ebola.
