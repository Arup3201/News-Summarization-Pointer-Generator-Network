It is arguably the most exclusive swimming pool in the country. Perfect, one might say, for a future king.

And that’s exactly why little Prince George is now enjoying weekly swimming lessons with his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, in the historic pool at Buckingham Palace, it can be revealed.

On his first birthday this week, George was seen being driven into Buckingham Palace by his mother, accompanied by his nanny Maria Borallo and a police protection officer, on what was believed to be a visit to his grandparents.

In fact, he was off to enjoy his weekly splash-about.

The pool, which is situated at the rear of the palace, was converted from a conservatory in 1938 and has been used by generations of royal children, including Prince Charles and his siblings, Andrew, Edward and Anne.

More recently, George’s late grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales, visited each week as part of her fitness regime, as well as using it to teach her sons William and Harry how to swim.

Now George is continuing the family tradition with regular dips with his mother when the family are in London.

At a recent event to highlight his new presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’

A source said: ‘The Duchess brings him up to the palace every week now.’

At a recent event to highlight his new presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’. 

His own father Prince Charles also revealed he instilled a love of water in his son from an early age.

‘I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,’ he said. 

Teaching babies to swim at an early age in a safe environment is highly recommended.

Members of the Royal Household are, it has been claimed, also permitted to use the Queen’s swimming pool. 

But rules state that if a staff member is swimming and a royal appears they have to get out of the pool unless invited to stay. 

If a staff member arrives to swim and a royal is already swimming, they must not attempt to join them, it is said.

Kensington Palace declined to comment last night, saying it wouldn’t discuss a ‘private’ matter.
