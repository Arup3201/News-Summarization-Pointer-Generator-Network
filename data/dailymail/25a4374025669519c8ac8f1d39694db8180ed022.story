Cilla Black has dropped a reference to child beating from one of her famous songs, calling it ‘inappropriate’ for modern audiences.

The former Blind Date host changed the line in Liverpool Lullaby during a performance  on a ‘family friendly’ ITV tribute show broadcast last week.

Cilla, 70, who has been performing the number since the late 1960s, sang the altered version at the end of Wednesday’s The One And Only Cilla Black, celebrating her 50 years in showbusiness.

Liverpool Lullaby is about a working-class mother struggling to bring up a child in the back streets of the city. The desperate mum warns her ‘mucky kid’ that unless he behaves, he will ‘gerra belt from your dad’ when he returns from a night in the pub.

Out of fashion: Cilla in the 1960s when she sang the old words to Liverpool Lullaby and left, Cilla pictured almost 50 years later appearing on the Paul O'Grady last week

But in the version she sang on Wednesday, Liverpudlian Cilla replaced the line, which normally appears in three verses, with: ‘You’ll get told off by your dad.’

The change was thought necessary even though the 90-minute programme didn’t start until 9pm.

The star’s agent and manager, her son Robert Willis, last night defended the new version, which he said was about ensuring the show stayed ‘family-friendly’.

He said: ‘Cilla loves the song and she thought it was an evocative and appropriate ending for the show. We changed the line about belting because we thought it was important to bring the lyrics up to date.

No one advocates people taking a belt to their children today, obviously.  It is just not appropriate. It may have been acceptable when the song first came out but it isn’t today.’

Cilla released the folk song as the B-side to her 1969 hit Conversations. But many fans, particularly in her native Liverpool, preferred the track to the A-side and the singer has embraced it ever since.

A spokesman for ITV last night said the star and the broadcaster had agreed to amend the song.

‘Cilla felt some of the sentiment could have been made more relevant for today,’ he said. ‘She discussed it with everyone and there was a feeling it was the right way to go.’
