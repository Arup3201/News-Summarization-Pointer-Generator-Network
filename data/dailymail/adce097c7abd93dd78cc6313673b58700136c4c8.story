Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, Prince George's new nanny, was tipped to become a nun had she not followed her passion of caring for children

Prince George’s new Spanish nanny would have become a nun if she had not ended up pursuing her passion for looking after children, friends claimed yesterday.

Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo’s austere lifestyle made her the perfect candidate to become a servant of God, they said.

Single Miss Borrallo, 43, a graduate of the prestigious nanny school Norland College, is said to have been nicknamed Santa – Spanish for saint – by those closest to her when she was a youngster.

Locals in her home city of Palencia in northern Spain said they would not have been surprised if Maria Teresa had ended up choosing a church job like her brother Luis,  ordained a deacon in 2011.

One said: ‘We all thought she would end up becoming a nun because she was such a different girl to the rest. She hardly had any friends and she didn’t show any interest in boys.’

Family hairdresser Antonio Robledo told Spanish daily El Mundo: ‘She is very special and shy and I’ve never known her to have had a boyfriend. Above all, she’s a good person.’

The new Royal nanny, whose engineer father Luis died of cancer, was born in Madrid  but moved to Palencia as a child. She is the second eldest of four children.

She attended church regularly with the rest of her family as she was growing up.

A neighbour at the spacious city centre apartment where her mother Maria Teresa still lives gave her private lessons in chemistry, physics and maths, which she is said to have struggled with at school.

She left Spain for the UK more than 20 years ago after graduating with a degree in teaching but returns to Palencia to see her family whenever she gets a chance.

One of her brothers, Ignacio, teaches private students in the area viola and violin.

He boasts on an online CV he is one of the most sought-out violin and viola teachers in Spain’s Castile and Leon region, with more than 20 years of experience at conservatories and music schools in his home country and Canada.

Miss Borrallo is a graduate of famous Norland College, where fees for undergraduates cost nearly £13,000 per year and students are required to wear a uniform including the signature hat

Graduates of the school are sought after by celebrities, so much so they teach nannies how to shield children from paparazzi, especially while driving

Her youngest brother Pablo, a teacher, is living and working in the south of France.

Maria Teresa’s parents’ 1967 wedding at a prestigious Roman Catholic school in Madrid received a mention in the society pages of Spain’s royalist Right-wing daily newspaper ABC.

Her retired housewife mum reportedly uses her free time to teach handicapped children from her home in Palencia.

Speaking on Friday before leaving for a weekend away, she said: ‘I am very proud of my daughter, that’s all I can say. On the personal front, and professionally, my daughter couldn’t be better.’

Her brother Luis revealed his sister had a soft spot for classic Spanish food including paella and the cold soup gazpacho.

He added: ‘I’m very happy for her because she’s worked hard to get where she has.

‘Children are her life and her great passion.’
