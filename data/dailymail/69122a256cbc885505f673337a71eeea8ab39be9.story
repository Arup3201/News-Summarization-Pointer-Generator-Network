TOWIE star Kirk Norcross has apologised to his fans after explicit pictures of him performing a sex act were leaked online.

The 25-year-old bar owner and reality star issued the cheeky apology after the pictures emerged online on Thursday evening, saying: 'Sorry guys'.

He added: 'People these days!!!! Cooooome oooonnn guys we have all done it I'm just the stupid one that got caught!'

Apology: Kirk, who in the past confessed to bedding 1,000 women, issued this rather cheeky apology

The x-rated snaps of Kirk, who quit TOWIE for a second time this year, are thought to have been leaked from a Skype chat with a young woman.

Self-confessed lothario Kirk, who is naked in the series of pictures, had earlier tweeted he was having a Skype chat with a fetish model.

After the pictures were shared online, being retweeted thousands of times, model Cami Li was forced to take to Twitter to deny being involved in the saucy chat.

The model, who describes herself as a high fashion model specialising in fetish, is believed to be a colleague of Kirk's from a club night.

Kirk, who has just released his autobiography Essex Boy: My Story, recently told a national newspaper he 'didn't care who saw him naked' and previously confessed to bedding 1,000 women.

Kirk's million followers retweeted the snaps with many fans saying the star was 'stung' by his Skype companion.

In the former reality star's autobiography he details his struggle with anxiety and poor luck in love.

He admits to being broken hearted by Amy Childs, who dumped him for her current boyfriend David Peters, and said at the height of fame it is difficult to meet women.

Kirk, who admits to a troubled relationship with father Mick, said fame left him so depressed and paranoid he would only date women out of the public eye.

A spokesman for Kirk branded the leaked pictures 'Malicious'.

He told MailOnline: 'The attempted actions of a certain individual to publicly embarrass and humiliate Kirk with the release of grossly intimate and personal images is nothing but malicious and socially irresponsible.

'Kirk is mortified and hugely disappointed that a private moment from the past has been shared in such an irresponsible manner and would like to apologise for any offence they have caused.'
