Interest in jobs at Virgin is likely to soar following suggestions by Billionaire boss Richard Branson that people should be able to take time off work whenever they want.

Branson wrote, in an excerpt from his new book, The Virgin Way: Everything I know About Leadership: 'It is left to the employee alone to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours a day, a week or a month off.'

Branson, who released the material on his blog, said the plan was in action at Virgin officers in Britain and the U.S. If it worked, he said, he would encourage all of the company's subsidiaries to stop counting holiday leave.

Virgin boss Richard Branson believes that people should be able to take vacation time whenever they want

Branson said he began considering the concept after his daughter told him Netflix was doing it

He said the plan worked on the assumption that employees will only take time off when they think it won't impact on them or the company.

Branson said he first decided to try out the plan after seeing an article on how Netflix did not track staff vacation time. 

He recalled his daughter telling him: 'I have a friend whose company has done the same thing and they've apparently experienced a marked upward spike in everything –- morale, creativity and productivity have all gone through the roof.'

Branson isn't the first billionaire to publicly advocate for a more flexible work-life balance.

Branson, pictured here with his staff during the Virgin trains 'Arrive Awesome' campaign earlier this month, said the plan was already in action at Virgin offices in Britain and the U.S.

In an interview posted on YouTube Google co-founder Larry Page recently said: 'If you really think about the things you need to make yourself happy -- housing, security, opportunity for your kids ... it's not that hard for us to provide those things.'

He added: 'The idea that everyone needs to work frantically to meet peoples' needs is not true.'
