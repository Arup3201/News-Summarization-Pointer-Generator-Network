North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il demanded $10 billion in cash and half a million tons of food as a precondition of holding a summit with the South

North Korea's former leader Kim Jong Il demanded $10 billion in cash and half a million tons of food in 2009 as a precondition of holding a summit with the South, a former South Korean president has revealed.

Former president Lee Myung-bak said he refused to pay anything for holding talks, despite the fact one of his predecessors,  president Kim Dae-jung, held the first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2000.

Kim Dae-jung was initially credited with bringing in a period of warming ties between the countries, but that achievement was later tarnished by the revelation that he helped channel $500 million to the North.

The two Koreas remain technically at war because their 1950-53 war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Lee was president from 2008 to 2013 and says in his memoir, which is to be published next week,  in 2009 North Korea began proposing a summit meeting between him and Kim Jong Il.

The proposal came after senior North Korean officials visited Seoul to pay their respects to the late Kim Dae-jung, who  won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reconcile with the North.

His efforts were damaged when a close associate  was convicted in 2006 of pressuring the Hyundai conglomerate into sending $500 million to North Korea shortly before the 2000 summit.

Kim Dae-jung's immediate successor, Roh Moo-hyun, met Kim Jong Il for a second summit in 2007.

Lee says one of the North Korean officials who visited Seoul, Kim Ki Nam, told him that Kim Jong Il had said it wouldn't be difficult for the leaders of the two Koreas to meet again if agreements signed during the 2000 and 2007 summits were carried out. 

Five days after the meeting, Lee claims North Korea called for a 'considerable amount' of rice, fertilizer and other aid shipments in return for a summit.

Lee said: 'The document looked like some sort of standardized "summit bill" with its list of assistance we had to provide and the schedule written up.'

Reuters obtained an advance copy of chapters on North Korea today.

The book refers to a list sent from the North 'as a condition for a summit' that included 400,000 tons of rice, 100,000 tons of corn, 300,000 tons of fertilizer, asphalt worth $100 million and $10 billion for the establishment of a development bank in North Korea.

'We shouldn't be haggling for a summit,' Lee wrote. 

In the book Lee claims Kim Jong Il continued to push for a summit with the South before he died in late 2011, but it did not materialize because he refused to acknowledge a 2010 torpedo attack on a South Korean naval vessel.

Lee, a conservative who ended a decade of liberal rule in South Korea, pushed Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons programme, left office without ever meeting the North's leader.

Parts of the memoir reveal that senior intelligence officials from the two Koreas made secret visits to each other's countries to explore summit possibilities in 2010, when two deadly attacks blamed on Pyongyang killed 50 South Koreans.

The Cheonan was torpedoed in 2010, killing 46 sailors. South Korea blamed the North which denied any involvement. 

Lee says a North Korea envoy who visited Seoul that year was later publicly executed after returning to the North.

Both Kim Jong Il's successor, Kim Jong Un, and current South Korean President Park Geun-hye said this month they were open to the idea of talks.

It would be the third summit meeting since the two Koreas were divided 70 years ago, although chances seem low as the countries bicker over the terms for talks. 

Last Friday North Korea demanded the lifting of sanctions imposed by Lee's government after the 2010 sinking as a condition for resuming dialogue.

The first summit in 2000 prompted an era of cooperation between the rivals, but also became a source of criticism in South Korea. 

Conservatives said Seoul's then 'sunshine policy' of providing generous economic aid to Pyongyang with few strings attached supported the North's nuclear and missile developmen and allowed it to continue staging provocations against South Korea.

Lee halted such aid and refused to implement rapprochement projects signed in the second summit in 2007. 

His actions earned him public loathing in North Korea, where state media called him a 'rat' and a 'traitor.'

Lee also saw tension spike sharply after his inauguration.

A soldier killed a South Korean tourist in North Korea in 2008, and North Korea staged long-range rocket and nuclear tests in 2009. 

On the sidelines of a regional conference in Beijing in October 2009, Lee says Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told him that Kim Jong Il had sent a message that he wanted a summit. 

Lee says he was willing, but didn't want to pay for the meeting and wanted the North's nuclear program on the agenda.

Later in 2009, officials of the Koreas met secretly in Singapore, and North Korea insisted on economic aid in exchange for a summit.

Prospects for summit talks were further hurt after a South Korea-led international investigation blamed North Korea for torpedoing the South Korean warship  in March 2010.

The North then launched an artillery strike on a South Korean island that killed four people in November of that year. North Korea has denied involvement in the ship sinking.

North Korea's state media did not immediately comment on the contents of Lee's memoir.
