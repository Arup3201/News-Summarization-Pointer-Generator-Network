The attorney who successfully defended Casey Anthony is now representing one of the young Florida girls accused of cyber-stalking to the point she committed suicide.

Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, when she goes to trial to face accusations of bullying Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to the point she committed suicide last month.

When reached Wednesday by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr Baez said he was not available for comment because he was spending the entire day getting to know the family and reviewing the case.

Well known: Casey Anthony attorney Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, in her cyber-bullying trial

Made famous for defending Ms Anthony to a jury that found her not guilty of murdering her daughter, Mr Baez was approached by the Roman family, the spokesperson said. 

The Orlando Sentinel first reported he had been hired to represent the 12-year-old girl.

News of his retention comes on the heels of reports that Tricia Norman, Ms Sedwick’s mother, hired attorney David Henry.

It is not clear what Mr Henry’s course of action will be, but an announcement on his law firm’s website did offer some clues.

‘We’re going to look at every possible potentially responsible party,’ Mr Henry said. ‘We applaud the efforts of Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and his office in investigating and responding to this tragedy.’

Echoing the comments of Polk County 
Sheriff Grady Judd, Mr Henry explained that the two teens ‘repeatedly 
and maliciously’ cyberbullied Ms Sedwick, including telling her to 
‘drink bleach and die,’ as well as kill herself.

‘It used to be a parent could be relatively assured that their kids were safe in their room, but that’s no longer the case. A computer in a child’s bedroom is their porthole to the outside world,’ said Mr Henry.

‘Cyberbullying has become a pervasive problem among our children and it needs to stop,’ he added.

It is not known if Guadalupe Shaw, 14, has yet hired an attorney. She remains in custody.

Tormented by the relentless bullying, Ms Sedwick jumped to her death from a silo at a cement plant not far from her home.

Ms Shaw’s stepmother is also in custody after being arrested last week for child abuse.
