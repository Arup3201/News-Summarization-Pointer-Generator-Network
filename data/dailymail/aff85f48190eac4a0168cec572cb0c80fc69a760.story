There was an era when sexy pictures of women's bodies weren't leaked over iCloud but idolised through art. 

Celebrating all things vintage and curvaceous, luxury book publisher TASCHEN has released The Art of the Pin-up, showcasing hundreds of beautiful paintings of pin-up girls.

The impressive coffee table tome includes work by over 80 leading pin-up artists including Alberto Vargas, George Petty and Gil Elvgren, whose paintings are now being sold for over $200,000.

A fold-out writing set from the Second World War would have provided letter-writing inspiration in the barracks

A liberated pin-up girl throws her arms in the air in  abandon an exotic scene by a lagoon

With a classic bob and fringe and the tops of her stockings on show, pin-up pictures don't come more classic than this one in which the model has accidentally knocked over a pot of ink next to a picture of her sweetheart

All of the classic pictures were produced between 1920 and 1970 for calendars, magazine covers and centrefolds and range from suggestive scenarios to Renaissance-like nudes and humorously imagined scenes.

Even a letter-writing kit is embellished with a lady languishing along it in an exotic dress, perhaps in the hope she would inspire them to write home to their real sweethearts.

Most of the original paintings were thrown away by publishers and calendar companies after they had been printed but the book includes photos of original prints, taken on-site at the historic Brown & Bigelow Company, home to the world’s largest archive of vintage pin-up calendars.

Pin-up art meets propaganda in this second World War calendar art work 

In the classic image of a flying girl,  a muscular model seems to take to the skies in her swimsuit

The images got their name from soldiers tearing the pages out and pinning up their ideal curvaceous ladies on the walls of their barracks. 

The book has been put together by Diane Hanson, a former men’s magazine editor  and each chapter profiles a top pin-up artist alongside a reproduction of one of their original calendar or magazine cover images and an insight into the artist's creative process. 

With over 80 artists featured across the book, The Art of the Pin-up is the most complete collection of pin-up artists ever compiled.
