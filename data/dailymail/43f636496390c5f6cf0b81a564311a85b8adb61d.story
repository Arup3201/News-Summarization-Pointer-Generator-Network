The mother of Mathew Knowles' lovechild claims the music mogul has fallen behind on child support payments and barely sees their son Nixon, now four.

She also told Inside Edition - in an incendiary interview - that the 63-year-old hasn't introduced Nixon to his superstar sister Beyonce.

But according to Wright, Nixon and Bey could've been very close indeed, as she also alleges that Mathew wanted her to hand their baby over to the XO singer and husband Jay Z before their own child, Blue Ivy, was conceived.

No contact : Alexsandra Wright's son Nixon by Beyonce's father Mathew Knowles has never met his superstar half sister

Wright told Inside Edition's Jim Moret: 'You've seen more of my son than he has.'

She added that she will have to file for public assistance because Matthew Knowles hasn’t paid $32,000 in court-ordered child support, a claim he denies.

Wright told Moret: 'I tried everything to not have it public, but unfortunately that’s just not the way that Matthew chose to deal with this.'

She added that she doesn't blame Beyonce, 32, who is now estranged from her father.

Wright explained: 'I don’t expect Beyonce to take accountability. It’s not her problem. It’s not her situation.'

But she explained to IE that she will do whatever it takes to make Mathew take some responsibility for his son.

She said: 'I’m going to stand up and I’m going to fight, and I’m going to fight the next day because that’s the only way to give him his identity.' 

Mathew hit back in December last year that he had paid child support to his baby mother Alexsandra Wright.

But then, TMZ have once again reported that Beyonce's father Matthew Knowles is behind on payments, leaving Alexsandra using 'food stamps to survive'.

TMZ claim Mathew now owes $32,135,90 in child support.

Troubled: TMZ also reported that Beyonce's father Mathew had  fallen behind on his child support payments again

However, Beyonce's father has slammed initial reports that he owes the mother of his lovechild support cheques.

Sources close to the music manager told gossip website TMZ.com that messed up paperwork is to blame for the dispute.

Mathew, who is set to appear in 
court in Los Angeles on Friday in relation to the child support row, was
 said to be two months behind in his maintenance payments.

However, he has told friends that he 
made the payments slightly late, but past the deadline for being 
credited, so it only appears like he hasn't paid what he owes.

Mathew is now reportedly behind for 
his December payment, which was due on the 1st, but plans to pay the 
full $12,000 before it officially becomes delinquent.

Claims: Alexasandra Wright and son Nixon, now three, she claims Mathew is behind on child support

Before the split: Mathew with his superstar daughter (he used to be her manager, too) her sister Solange and his former wife of 31 years, Tina

In 2009, Beyonce's mother Tina filed 
for divorce from Mathew after he reportedly had an affair with 
Alexsandra, who fell pregnant and requested a paternity test.

Beyonce, 32, and sister Solange, 27, 
didn't attend their father's wedding when he re-married earlier this 
year, tying the knot with former model Gena Charmaine Avery in Houston, 
Texas in June.
