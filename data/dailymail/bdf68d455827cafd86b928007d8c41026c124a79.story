Normally when I'm enjoying honey it's spread on a piece of toast or spooned into a cup of tea – not slathered all over my back.

But the skyline honey treatment at Jumeirah Frankfurt’s Talise Spa is no ordinary massage.

Using a gritty paste containing granulated fruit and honey produced from beehives atop the luxury hotel’s roof, it feels like the massage therapist is giving my back and shoulders the once-over with sandpaper.

It may sound uncomfortable, but the spa’s signature treatment is so relaxing that I almost dozed off a few times.

Couples who are looking for a romantic getaway can book a double treatment room at the Talise Spa at Jumeirah Frankfurt

Located within the hotel, Talise Spa offers guests the perfect way to unwind with two saunas, relaxation areas and seven treatment rooms

The skyline honey treatment is Talise Spa's signature treatment, using honey from rooftop hives occupied by an estimated 40,000 bees

Guests can enjoy a relaxing drink in a quiet sauna room (there is one for men and one for women) before or after their treatments

From the moment the therapist told me to take a deep breath to the moment I climbed off the table, the exfoliating massage soothed the aches and pains I developed from sitting at a computer for more than 40 hours a week.

Capped with a relaxing head massage, I emerged with my skin feeling smoother than ever before.

From there I retreated to the sauna – there’s one for men and one for women – before returning to my deluxe studio room inside the 24-storey hotel, located in the heart of Frankfurt.

Relaxing at the warm, comfortable Talise Spa proved to be the perfect way to unwind after spending a few hours in the cold. 

Jumeirah Frankfurt's studio and deluxe studio rooms are designed to provide 'an enriched metropolitan living experience'

Each deluxe studio boasts a comfortable king-size bed and the centrepiece of the room - a standalone bathtub that provides a relaxing soak

The deluxe studio bathroom is an open space with a separate walk-in shower and a television embedded in the steam-proof mirror

Each studio and deluxe studio room boasts a spacious living are with a 42in flat-screen TV that swivels to face the couches or bed

Just a few hours before I settled in for the treatment I was downing gluwhein and stuffing my face with bratwurst and gingerbread (and maybe a chocolate-dipped pretzel) at Frankfurter Weihnachtsmarkt (Frankfurt Christmas Market).

At every turn along the one-kilometre market visitors encounter tiny log cabins selling mulled wine, sausage on a bun, reibekuchen (potato pancakes), heart-shaped gingerbread or, for those who have had their fill, hand-crafted ornaments and souvenirs.

With its central location Jumeirah is just steps from the sprawling and wildly-popular festive market and the Zeil shopping street, and within walking distance to many other attractions that are open year-round.

For those who are attending events in central Frankfurt or just doing some shopping on a weekend break, Jumeirah Frankfurt’s location provides the perfect base.

Jumeirah Frankfurt's beekeeper visits the property on average once a week in spring and summer to collect honey from the beehives

Jumeirah Frankfurt’s roof terrace on the 28th floor is home to more than 40,000 bees which produce honey used in its breakfast buffet

Guests can sit down fora formal meal or relax on sofas and armchairs in the lounge at Max on One, the hotel's signature restaurant

While the luxurious hotel is largely designed for business travellers, everyone is pampered during their stay at the Dubai-owned chain's lone location in Germany.

Friendly employees go out of their way to make guests feel important – from the moment they’re greeted with a complimentary drink upon arrival to the moment they check out.

With sweeping views of Frankfurt, my deluxe studio was incredibly sleek and stylish with ultimate comfort. It had warm colours with dark wood finishes that matched the colour of the floor.

Each deluxe studio boasts a spacious living room, 42in flat-screen TV that swivels to face the couches or bed, and touch pads that control the curtains, lighting and temperature. 

Skyline deluxe rooms offer incredible views of Frankfurt's towering skyscrapers, including the 56-storey Commerzbank Tower

Jumeirah Frankfurt’s room tempering system uses body heat and motion sensors to regulate in-room energy consumption

 The hotel is located in central Frankfurt and within walking distance to popular shopping areas and a number of museums

But the centrepiece of the room is a large standalone tub that straddles the bathroom and bedroom, and provides a relaxing soak while sipping your beverage of choice (in my case, it was a German wheat beer).

The bathroom is an open space with a separate walk-in shower and a television embedded in the steam-proof mirror.

The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on, although my sleep was disrupted by the sound of people in the room above me stomping around the floor.

One of the hotel's most impressive bits of state-of-the-art technology is its innovative room tempering system. Instead of conventional air conditioning it features a hybrid room tempering system using body heat detectors and motion sensors that, according to the hotel, regulate all in-room energy consumption efficiently and sustainably.

Still, the room temperature can be controlled with the push of a button. 

With fresh ingredients and seasonal fare, the food at Max on One is inventive with great attention to detail, and the service is outstanding

Max on One, located on the hotel's first floor, offers a relaxed and warm atmosphere not usually found at high-end restaurants

With access to the hotel and MyZeil shopping centre the El Rayyan restaurant offers an authentic selection of Lebanese cuisine

For dining or drinks, Jumeirah Frankfurt offers three options – Max on One for finer cuisine, El Rayyan for authentic Lebanese dishes, and Ember Bar and Lounge for cocktails.

With fresh ingredients and seasonal fare, the food at Max on One is inventive with great attention to detail, and the service is outstanding.

The meal I had was absolutely delicious – chestnut soup as a starter, perfectly prepared goose and potatoes as the main, and a specially-prepared spekulatius cake for dessert.

For those who want to hit the gym or go for a dip to burn off calories during their stay, all Jumeirah Frankfurt guests have complimentary access to the Fitness First Platinum Swim Club in the neighbouring MyZeil shopping centre.
