A teacher won his battle with Vodafone yesterday after a thief stole his mobile phone and ran up a £15,000 bill.

Osian Rhys Edwards, 29, called the mobile company immediately to cancel his phone when it was pickpocketed while he was on holiday in Barcelona.

But weeks later he was shocked to receive the huge bill - racked up in just a few hours calling premium rate lines.

Osian Rhys Edwards was told to pay the £15,000 bill despite claiming to report his phone stolen on the night of the theft

Pickpockets in the Catalan city target tourists and use their phones to place premium-rate calls before the handsets are blocked 

Mr Edwards feared his life would be on hold for the 'next ten to 15 years' because of the crippling bill which he could not afford to pay.

He also feared being blacklisted and unable to get credit and a mortgage because he has been forced to default on paying the bill.

But a top lawyer took up his case for free and Vodafone have backed down.

The company also dropped its bill demands against two other crime victims who had their phones stolen in Barcelona.

Mr Edwards, of Barmouth, North Wales, said: 'It was clear that I was the victim of fraudsters but Vodafone wants to hold me responsible.

The primary school teacher was originally told that the sum would be reduced to £10,000, but now Vodafone have relented and the bill has been wiped out

'I can't believe that this is allowed to happen,' he said.

'I'm extremely grateful to the barrister who helped me.

'Most people aren't aware that it is possible to run up a £15,000 bill in just a few hours.

'Vodafone must have known I hadn't run up this bill but they are quite content to try to get me to pay it.'

Mr Edwards is calling for capped bills to be brought in to stop others from falling victim of criminals racking up terrifying bills on stolen mobiles.

A spokeswoman for Vodafone said it had waived Mr Edwards' bill following a 'comprehensive review of the case. 

Mr Rhys Edwards is the latest victim of pickpockets in the Catalan city who steal mobile phones and use them to place premium-rate calls in quick succession before the handset is blocked. 

Sarah Harvey, an NHS worker from Brighton, was told to settle a £5,800 bill run up after her phone was stolen in the same city.

Georgia Harris, a recruitment worker, was initially told to pay £21,000 after her phone was stolen in 2013. Vodafone later withdrew its demand she pay for the foreign calls. 

In 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom ordered mobile phone companies produce plans to cap customers' bills. 

But the plans were never produced, and the issue was handed to the government with which companies are thought to be in continuing discussions.
