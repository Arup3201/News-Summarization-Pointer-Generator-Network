A transgender teenager who wore a dress to her Melbourne high school for the first time after 16 years as a boy says she finally feels like she exists after she 'felt like dying'.

Mia Pike, 17, was raised as a boy named Brendan but realised just over a year ago she was born the wrong gender. Her mother was so concerned by the troubled teen's mental state before the transition she revealed: 'I don't think Brendan would have made it to year 12'.

She wore a dress to Carrum Downs Secondary College, south-east of Melbourne, for the first time on Monday and officially changed her name at the school last week.

'I think it's more like I wasn't living before I started being myself,' Mia told MailOnline.

'I feel like I actually exist now and I'm definitely a lot happier.'

But the decision to identify as a girl six months ago wasn't easy and Mia admits she 'felt like dying' after she realised she was transgender.

'(I) just felt like I couldn't do it because no one would accept me,' Mia said.

'I was unhappy with myself when I realised. I thought I wouldn't ever be able to be myself.

'It was okay before I knew. But I felt depressed after that.

'The hard bit was telling everyone then having to explain it all.'

Her mother, Donna Pike, was unaware of the pain Mia was going through at the time and spent six months fearing for her child's life.

Ms Pike told The Project she wasn't sure if Mia would have coped had it not been for the school's support of her decision.Â 

'I don't think Brendan would have made it to year 12. I don't think Brendan would have become Mia and there's a very big chance Brendan wouldn't be here,' Ms Pike told the program.

Thoughts of suicide are not uncommon amongst transgender Australians - recent figures from the National LGBTI Health Alliance show 20 percent have considered suicide and 50 percent have attempted to take their life at least once.

The 17-year-old said she doesn't have any plans to go back to her life as Brendan and she hopes other teenagers can find inspiration in her story

Her school, Carrum Downs Secondary College, has implemented a number of practices to make Mia's transition easier including education for students and staff, according to principal Sherrallin Smith.

'We also built a group of students around her who support her in the school yard,' Ms Smith told The Project.

The 17-year-old said she 'didn't know about transgender people' until she attended Peninsula Pride meeting in May last year - a support group run by Queer Straight Alliance.

Since then, her support network has only grown. Her sister Meliza, 14, came out as a lesbian around the same time Mia revealed was actually a girl.

'Of course I'm so proud of my sister,' Meliza said.

But the transition hasn't come without its challenges.

'My dad doesn't agree with it and said to me that I might feel like this now but I probably won't later,' Mia said.

'He still calls me Brendan.'

But Mia said she doesn't have any plans to go back to her life as Brendan and she hopes other teenagers can find inspiration in her story.

'Stay strong and be patient, there is help out there for you,' Mia said.

Mia revealed her new identity to family and friends six months ago, including her 14-year-old sister Meliza
