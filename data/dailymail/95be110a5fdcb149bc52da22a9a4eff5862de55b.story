They are now being treated in the Eduardo Uria hospital in the Andean city of Potosi.

The exact nature of the other victims' injuries have not been released.

Bolivian roads are some of the most notorious in Latin America.

Official figures published in 2010 revealed 1,000 deaths and 40,000 injuries each year.

One of the most notorious is the Yungas Road, know as the Road of Death.

It is 43 miles in length and leads from La Paz to Coroico. Some estimates suggest that up to 300 travellers are killed each year on the road.

It is marked with crosses where many of the vehicles have fallen.

There is also a second Yungas Road, which connects La Paz to Chulumani and is 40 miles in length and is almost as dangerous as the road of death.
