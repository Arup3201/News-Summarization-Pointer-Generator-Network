A UPS driver has been fired after a Houston homeowner posted a security video online showing the delivery man throwing a parcel over a gate and urinating against his house. 

Ben Lucas only discovered what happened when he checked surveillance video after returning home on January 8 to find that his parcel had broken open and some of the items inside were damaged.

The video shows the delivery man walk up to Lucas' front gate. When the man realizes that the gate is locked he tosses the box over the fence instead of simply leaving the package on the ground.

A UPS driver has been fired after a Houston homeowner posted a security video online showing the delivery man throwing a parcel over a gate and urinating against his house 

The video shows the delivery man walk up to Lucas' front gate. When the man realizes that the gate is locked he tosses the box over the fence instead of simply leaving the package on the ground

The force of throwing the package over the gate caused the packaging to split open and resulted in hundreds of dollars worth of damage to the contents that included .22 caliber ammunition, chemicals and a machine used to clean gun parts.

To add insult to injury, the UPS driver then unzipped his pants and urinated on the side of Lucas' house.

'So basically I paid someone to come to my house and pee on it,' Lucas told Click2Houston.

He got in contact UPS and offered to send them the video, but was very disappointed when a company official offered no real apology and seemed more concerned about the package damage than the urination. 

Lucas also said no one at the company seemed interested in seeing the video.

'I just wanted them to hear me and maybe give me an email address where I could send them the video,' said Lucas. 'They simply just didn't want to see it.'

Disappointed by what he felt was a lack of concern from the company, Lucas posted the video to social media and promptly caught the company's full attention. 

He soon got a call from a UPS divisional manager who had seen the video. She offered a full apology and suggested sending over a 'we're sorry' gift.

'That's what I kind of wanted. I just wanted someone to say, 'yeah he shouldn't have done that we'll try to make sure that doesn't happen again,'' said Lucas.

The company has said the seasonal employee was fired because his behavior was unacceptable and his actions violated decency and delivery care. 

'UPS was dismayed by actions that violated decency and delivery care. The local management team did take action to terminate the individual who was a seasonal delivery helper,' said the company in a statement. 

'However, they were wrong if they did not clarify this resolution with Mr. Lucas at the time. UPS sincerely apologizes to our customer. No behavior like this is acceptable.'
