Where are the Liverpool of last season? It is a question that has been asked of Brendan Rodgers almost every week since this campaign began.

Having seen their team come within a whisker of winning the Barclays Premier League, the anticipation supporters would have felt during the summer has, after three defeats in five matches, started to be replaced by apprehension. They feel like they have been here before.

In some respects, they have. Given the changes that have taken place since last May, it is impossible not to draw parallels with what happened in 2009, when Liverpool finished runners-up to Manchester United but failed to take the final step.

Brendan Rodgers has struggled to get Liverpool playing the way they were last season

For the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona this summer, you had the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid back then. No matter how brave a face you try to put on the situation, you cannot under-estimate how damaging it is to lose part of the spine of your team.

Suarez, with his 31 goals, was clearly more vital to what Liverpool achieved last season than Alonso was in 2008-09 but the perception around both transfers is the same: you know you are losing a world-class talent and the team no longer looks right.

Our problem in 2009 was the fact Alonso’s replacement, Alberto Aquilani, arrived injured and struggled to make an impact. This year Rodgers has seen his band’s lead singer move on and, so far, it seems as if Suarez has been replaced with backing singers.

Liverpool, however, have spent more than £100million. With nine new faces arriving, there will be a period of adjustment and we have heard how they will need time to settle. I used to feel, though, that you could gauge within a couple of months about whether a signing would be successful.

Think about it: Sami Hyypia and Didi Hamann on to Alonso, Fernando Torres, Javier Mascherano, Suarez and even Daniel Sturridge — they were all doing the business almost as soon as they walked through the door. Those who struggled in their first season very rarely turned it around in their second year.

I know it’s early days but, when you have spent £38m on defenders like Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho, you don’t want to be hearing about settling in. You want instant results but Liverpool are shipping goals.

Lovren was brought in to add leadership at the back but Liverpool actually look worse defensively than they did last season. Sakho doesn’t fill you with confidence when you watch him and nor does the goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet. They need to step it up urgently.

Rodgers had the good fortune last season of injuries not making much impact on his team but, with a bigger fixture list, he had to invest to bring in numbers and quality. Of those who have come in only Alberto Moreno, the young Spanish left back, has impressed me so far.

It must be emphasised it is still early days but the one thing that I associate with Rodgers’ Liverpool is absent: intensity. With and without the ball, Liverpool wouldn’t let the opposition settle, blitzing them with whirlwind starts. Everton, who cross Stanley Park on Saturday, felt that force in January.

Suarez set the tone, harrying and hassling. He defended from the front and is the best in the world at creating that relentless energy that swamped teams. If intensity is the word you associate with Rodgers’ Liverpool, you would not use it to describe Mario Balotelli, Suarez’s replacement.

When he played for Manchester City, I wasn't a fan and what I've seen so far hasn't persuaded me to change my mind. He has a tendency to walk around, which I don’t like to see. He has to bust a gut more often to get in the box.

Another issue troubling Rodgers is that Liverpool haven’t been creating chances with the same frequency either. Teams have targeted Steven Gerrard to stop him launching attacks from deep, with Gabby Agbonlahor and Stewart Downing stifling him in the defeats by Aston Villa and West Ham.

When Suarez, Sturridge and Raheem Sterling were at their devastating best last season, it suited Gerrard to sit deep and pull the strings but with Suarez gone and Sturridge injured, who is there to score and create?

There has been a lot of talk about his form in the holding-midfield role. If he continues to be targeted is there an option for him to play further forward and give teams something different to think about?

Gerrard is at his best when he is able to sit deep in midfield, but has been exposed this season

Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho (centre) has struggled for form so far this season 

No other midfielder in the squad has the ability to score from outside the box or create like the captain. Of the others who can create, Philippe Coutinho is struggling for form and Adam Lallana has only just returned from injury.

One thing that is certain is Gerrard and Lucas struggle to play together. Lucas should come in for the games when Stevie is rested.

Gerrard is used to such scrutiny but maybe some of the others have not experienced the criticism that has come their way this week. Yet if Liverpool do not improve in the next two games against Everton and Basle in the Champions League, they won’t know what has hit them.

Do not mistake how important a win in the Mersey derby would be for Liverpool. This could be exactly what the team needs as a springboard. With Everton chasing a first win at Anfield since 1999, there could be no better time for last season’s Liverpool to reappear.

Koeman is piling pressure on Pochettino 

It's a big weekend for a number of managers, not least Mauricio Pochettino, who takes Tottenham into the north London derby.

If Tottenham were to lose at the Emirates Stadium today following last week’s disappointing performance against West Bromwich, Pochettino would be considered to have had a poor start to his reign at White Hart Lane.

In contrast, Southampton — the side he left behind — have been going from strength to strength and it will not have gone unnoticed by him that Ronald Koeman, his replacement, delivered a win at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday. 

Mauricio Pochettino would be considered to have had a poor start should Spurs lose at Arsenal 

Southampton’s flying start will have heaped a little bit of pressure on Pochettino, as they look as if they are improving without him. David Moyes faced this problem 12 months ago, when Manchester United struggled and Roberto Martinez, his replacement, began to improve Everton.

I am a big fan of Pochettino and I thought his work at Southampton was excellent. His teams were aggressive, well organised — he reminded me at times of how Rafa Benitez used to set up Liverpool — but he has gone to a club where expectations are greater and results are demanded.

Tottenham’s ambition is to make it back into the Champions League and while it will be difficult to get into the top four, Pochettino will be expected to oversee a better challenge for those places. There could be no better place to launch his reign than the Emirates.

This week I'm looking forward to...  

Seeing Jamie Vardy build on last week’s heroics.

Watching Vardy’s jet-heeled performance against Manchester United from the safety of a TV studio made me feel relieved to be retired!

He was bursting with energy and enthusiasm and tormented United’s defenders, stealing the show in a remarkable game. To see Vardy thriving on the big stage set a great example to young footballers of how they should never give up on their dream. 

Jamie Vardy had a day to remember as he helped Leicester beat Manchester United last weekend

Vardy deserves great credit for forcing his way through the ranks, from non-league Stocksbridge Park Steels to Leicester via Fleetwood and Halifax Town, and he will remember the day he took United apart for the rest of his life.

The thing about the Premier League, though, is that it does not allow you a moment to sit back and think you’ve cracked it. You constantly face new challenges and you cannot dwell on what has gone before.

So, to take his game forward, Vardy must produce in lesser matches, such as today’s clash with Crystal Palace. If he can do that consistently, he will ensure his name stays in the headlines. He has certainly given himself a fantastic base to build from.
