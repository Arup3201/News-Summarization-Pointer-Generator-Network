Honour: Designer Sarah Burton was awarded an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) today

Designer Sarah Burton, who created the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress, said she'd love to turn her hand to maternity wear for the mum-to-be as she received an OBE today.

Asked if she would be making any 
maternity clothes for Kate, who announced last week she is pregnant, the
designer laughed and said: 'I hope I will be'.

Burton, who is herself currently pregnant with twins due in February, said working with the Duchess on the coveted commission last year was a 'real honour'.

Speaking about Kate on her wedding day 
to Prince William at Westminister Abbey the designer said: 'She looked so beautiful, she’s got such an amazing 
sense of grace and style, it was quite easy to make her look good.

'It was a real labour of love and a real collaboration, for me it was a huge highlight of my career.'

As the creative director at fashion house Alexander McQueen, Burton spent months making the dress with input from the Duchess.

The designer said she never expected to 
receive the royal commission: 'It came completely out of the blue, it 
was very exciting and I felt very privileged.'

Kate's wedding dress had an intricate 
train which measured nearly 9ft (2.7m) - modest in comparison to many 
previous royal brides.

The train and bodice were decorated with
delicate lace applique flowers, handcrafted using the Carrickmacross 
lace-making technique which originated in Ireland in the 1820s.

The lace design also incorporated the four floral emblems of the United Kingdom - the rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock.

In the run-up to the wedding, staged in 
April last year, St James's Palace said the bride had chosen British 
brand Alexander McQueen for the 'beauty of its craftsmanship' and its 'respect for traditional workmanship and the technical construction of 
clothing'.

Speaking after receiving the OBE  for services to the British fashion industry during a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony, Burton said: 'I'm very, very humbled and it's just a huge honour to be here - I'm very lucky.'

Burton became creative director of the British label in May 2010 following the death of Alexander McQueen - also known as Lee - earlier that year.

She has a long association with the fashion company having first joined in 1996 as an intern before returning after her graduation and later becoming head of women's wear before acting at McQueen's aide.

She said: 'I've been given some amazing opportunities - to work for someone as amazing as Lee and then having the honour of doing the wedding dress, that was a real honour.'

The Prince of Wales, who Burton met briefly at the royal wedding, presented Burton with her OBE.

She said Kate isn't the only style icon in the royal family as she praised the Prince's fashion sense.

She said: 'I think he’s got an amazing sense of style and has quite a history with Savile Row and has impeccable taste.'

Expectant parents: Burton said Kate was a pleasure to work with and she hoped to help her dress her bump
