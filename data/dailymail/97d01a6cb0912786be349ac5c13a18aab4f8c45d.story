While Mark Zuckerberg continues to enjoy his budget holiday in Hawaii, it has been revealed the Facebook CEO is even richer than previously thought after he gained $2.3 billion from selling 60 million stock options just before his company's initial public offering last year.

The famously frugal billionaire is currently enjoying a no-frills holiday in Kauai with his
Harvard-educated doctor wife on their latest trip to Hawaii, where they
are rumored to be on the look out for real estate on the 
island.

Despite his latest windfall, sport-shorts wearing Zuckerberg remains focused on
the simple things in life. Rather than indulging in lavish dinners and 
extravagant outings, he has been spotted eating burgers and surfing in recent days.

Zuckerberg isn't the first frugal billionaire, Warren Buffet is another who would prefer to keep his wealth in the bank rather than spend it on extravagant purchases. He famously still lives in the same modest home he bought in 1958 for $31,500.

Facebook's CEO has another reason to keep his vacation cheap and cheerful. According to regulatory 
documents filed Friday, he has also been saddled with a massive $1.1 
billion tax bill. Money he raised by selling 30.2 million 
Facebook shares for $38 apiece in the IPO.

Facebook's
stock hasn't closed above $38 since the IPO was completed last May. The
shares gained 71 cents Friday to close at $26.85.

The 29 percent decline from 
Facebook's IPO price has cost Zuckerberg nearly $7 billion on paper, 
based on the 609.5 million shares of company stock that he owned as of 
March 31, according to the regulatory filing. His current stake is still
worth $16.4 billion.

Zuckerberg, who started Facebook in 
his Harvard University dorm room in 2004, has indicated he has no 
immediate plans to sell more stock.

The proxy statement filed to announce Facebook's June 11 
shareholder meeting is the first time that the magnitude of Zuckerberg's
stock option gain had been quantified.

The proxy also revealed that 
Zuckerberg's pay package last year rose 16 percent because of increased 
personal usage of jets chartered by the company as part of his security 
program.

Zuckerberg's compensation last year 
totaled nearly $2 million, up from $1.7 million last year. Of those 
amounts, $1.2 million covered the costs of Zuckerberg's personal air 
travel last year, up from $692,679 in 2011.

If not for the spike in travel costs,
Zuckerberg's pay would have declined by 17 percent. His salary and 
bonus totaled $769,306 last year versus $928,833 in 2011.

But despite being worth $13.3billion, Zuckerberg enjoys life's simple pleasures. Earlier this week he and his wife were spotted chatting with friends at picnic tables while snacking on Kauai's famous Bubba burgers and smoothies.

The couple, who are notoriously 
down-to-earth, sported casual wear and Mark wore his now-famous sandals,
which are parodied by Jesse Eisenberg in the film about Facebook, The 
Social Network.

'We try to stick pretty close to what our goals are and what we believe 
and what we enjoy doing in life - just simple things,' Chan has previously told The New 
Yorker.

As the couple headed to their beach front house, they were seen walking past Shave Ice Paradise - a favorite of the Obama family when the First Family vacations in Hawaii.

It is just the latest trip to Hawaii for Zuckerberg and Chan, who switched web surfing for wave surfing in Maui last December. They were seen chatting with beach goers and enjoying lessons in the water.

And while the couple do not appear to be splashing out this trip, it was reported that Zuckerberg did go on a spending spree in the area in January, when he bought several luxury condos in Honolulu.

He was reportedly interested in buying 
several units in a 23-story ultra-luxury condominium under development. 
Each unit costs $1.6 million - with penthouse suites reaching $9 
million.

The couple met at a college party in 2003 as they stood in line for the bathroom at Zuckerberg's Jewish fraternity at Harvard University, Alpha Epsilon Pi.

'He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,' Chan told the New Yorker.

They married in May last year in Zuckerberg's backyard in Palo Alto, California - after telling their unwitting guests the celebration was solely to mark Chan's graduation from medical school.

As well as family and friends, they were joined by their dog Beast and serenaded by Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong.

Zuckerberg was no doubt ready for a holiday following his first foray into politics this month.

With other Silicon Valley leaders, he
launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, 
boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research.

Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced 'forward us') in an op-ed article in The Washington Post two weeks ago.

In
it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to 
get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, 
skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.'
