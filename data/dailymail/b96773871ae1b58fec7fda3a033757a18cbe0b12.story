Computers in Whitehall were used to make insulting alterations to Wikipedia entries about the Hillsborough disaster, it emerged yesterday.

The Cabinet Office has pledged to make ‘urgent inquiries’ into the anonymous changes, which were made over three years.

They began on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy when ‘blame Liverpool fans’ was added to the online encyclopaedia.

Tragedy: Supporters are crushed against the barrier as disaster strikes before the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in Sheffield on April 15, 1989

The words ‘nothing for the victims of the Heysel stadium disaster’ were also added to a description of the Hillsborough memorial at the Anfield stadium.

Computers on Whitehall’s secure intranet were used again in 2012 to change the phrase ‘You’ll never walk alone’ to ‘You’ll never walk again’.

Further abusive revisions were traced to IP addresses of computers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and the Solicitor General’s office.

On another occasion, the description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the well-known quote ‘He made the people happy’ to the bizarre ‘He made a wonderful lemon drizzle cake’.

The revelations came to light after 34 IP addresses of Whitehall computers were disclosed via a parliamentary question.

'We’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this'

Analysis of Wikipedia’s revision history revealed at least two of these unique ID codes were used to amend the Hillsborough and Anfield pages with the sick comments.

An investigation has now been launched.

Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, described the references as ‘absolutely disgusting’ and said the families of the 96 victims who perished at the FA cup semi-final would demand a formal inquiry.

She said: ‘We’re still in the inquests and we’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this. It’s absolutely appalling, disgraceful.

'I hear something like that and it upsets me a great deal, it makes me incredibly sad'

Margaret Aspinall, Hillsborough Family Support Group

‘It’s shocking that these comments came from within the Government, no matter how spurious.

'The fact is that these changes came from within the Government and that’s very saddening. It warrants an investigation and we will be seeking formal advice from our legal team.’

Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: ‘I don’t even know how to react, it’s just so sad.

'I hear something like that and it upsets me a great deal, it makes me incredibly sad. I’m glad somebody has found out about it but I’m frightened to be honest that we haven’t known until now.’

'This is a matter that we will treat with the utmost seriousness and are making urgent inquiries'

Cabinet Office spokesman

Establishing exactly which computer or individual was responsible could be difficult as it is understood the IP addresses cover thousands of Whitehall computers.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘This is a matter that we will treat with the utmost seriousness and are making urgent inquiries.

‘No one should be in any doubt of the government’s position regarding the Hillsborough disaster and its support for the families of the 96 victims and all those who have been affected by the tragedy.’
