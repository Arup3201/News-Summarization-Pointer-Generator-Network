A BBC radio football commentator who branded Ipswich Town fans the 'great unwashed' in a live broadcast has been forced to apologise for his comments. 

Brenner Woolley, who has reported on Ipswich games for more than 10 years at the station, scored his embarrassing own goal when he thought he was off air.

He made the howler at the half-time break in the clubs' 2-1 win over Wolves at Portman Road on Tuesday night.

But Woolley's derogatory comment was picked up by supporters listening to the online worldwide live match commentary service provided by team's 'Player' service on the club's website.

His comments were not broadcast over the normal airwaves. 

Nick Gibbs, editor of The Ibiza Sun newspaper, said Woolley blundered as he discussed the post-match telephone call-in show with co-commentator and ex-England star Mick Mills.

Mr Gibbs, who was listening in the broadcast, said Woolley spoke the following: 'I'll give you these headphones at full-time so you can hear the great unwashed!'

He said their chat, supposed to be private, could be heard for about 10 minutes during the half-time interval.

Angry Ipswich fans have called for the broadcaster to  apologise at the next game.

One supporter, named Martyn, wrote on Twitter: 'I think Brenner Woolley should be made to stand in the middle of the pitch, at half-time on Saturday, and apologise to the fans.'

BBC Radio Suffolk have confirmed that Woolley used the term 'great unwashed'.

A BBC Radio Suffolk spokesman said: 'We have spoken to Brenner and made clear to him that these comments are unacceptable.

'Brenner accepts this and has apologised.'

The station is thought to have launched an urgent investigation into the blunder.

Woolley joined BBC Radio Suffolk from Sheffield-based Hallam FM in 2001.

Managed by Mick McCarthy, Ipswich Town Football Club was founded in 1878 and play in the Football League Championship.

The club's fans are known as the Tractor Boys. 

Mr Gibbs said he did not take Woolley's comments 'too seriously'.

'It was good half-time entertainment and, aside from hearing Norwich were losing, was better than the usual half-time round-ups.

'I was hoping Mick Mills would start singing along to the Tannoy music but alas he must have been eating his sandwiches.

'Football call-in shows are renowned for attracting some pretty odd characters and if that's the worst name they get called 'off-air' they've got off pretty lightly,' he laughed.

'That said, if you make a gaffe in the media you deserve a bit of banter back.

'The Ipswich Town Player is a great service enabling those of us around the world to listen to Radio Suffolk's live match commentaries.

'Perhaps in the next broadcast Brenner will say hello to the ITFC supporters branch in Ibiza, all eight of us, and the rest of Ipswich's 'great unwashed' around the world.'
