A man walked into a Catholic church and shot his father-in-law in the back of the head while his wife watched during Mass on Sunday as parishioners were lining up for communion, according to police.

Investigators say 35-year-old Charles Richard Jennings Jr, from Ogden, was captured on Sunday afternoon in nearby Box Elder County after fleeing in a stolen pickup truck.

Witnesses say they heard one gunshot during the 11:30am Mass at Saint James the Just Catholic Church, and that parishioners immediately hit the floor, with people diving under pews for cover.

Suspect: Charles Richard Jennings has been named as the gunman. Jennings reportedly escaped the scene in a stolen a white 1996 GMC truck

The victim was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, where he was listed in critical but stable condition. His name wasn't immediately released.

Police say the victim was deliberately targeted by the gunman and it wasn't a random act of violence.

Jennings reportedly escaped the scene in a stolen a white 1996 GMC truck.

The owner of the truck, who did not want to be named, told police that Jennings jumped over the fence into his yard 'in a state of distress' and was hardly able to talk because he was breathing so heavily.

The man was with his 19-month-old daughter while his wife was sleeping indoors.

He said to him: 'I need you to help me,' and asked for the keys to his pickup truck. When he refused, Jennings then allegedly took out his gun and said he did not want to hurt anyone.

The man handed over his keys and cellphone and Jennings fled.

Police were able to track Jennings down after his family called police to tell them he had been in contact with them and wanted to turn himself in.

The reason for the shooting is not clear.

Rev Erik Richtsteig told Deseret News that people in the congregation were really shaken up by what happened and described the ordeal as 'something no one should have to go through'.

The reverend said when the gunman left the church, some parishioners chased after him.

'Nowhere is immune from evil and it's what people do when they're confronted with it that really shows their character,' he said. 'I'm really proud of my people here at the church.'

Neighbor Tammy Roe toldÂ KUTV she was shocked that Jennings would do such a thing.

'He doesn't seem like that type of 
person, I was shocked. I never pictured him as someone who would kill 
someone. He was happy-go-lucky.'

She has lived next to the Jennings for more than a decade and has no idea why he would want to shoot his father-in-law.

Jennings has previous convictions for burglary and drugs charges.
