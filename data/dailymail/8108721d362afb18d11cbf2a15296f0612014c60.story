A Scotland Yard spokesman said Mr McKoy had been in the venue, on Portpool Lane in Hatton Wall, in the hours leading up to his death before being involved in an incident.

Officers said they are investigating the possibility that this may have been a factor in his murder.

A suspect was seen fleeing the scene in the direction of Leather Lane and detectives from Trident, which investigates gun-related murders within the black community, are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

DCI John Crossley said: 'The venue was very busy going into the early hours of New Year's Day and we are extremely keen to talk to anyone who was in attendance.

'We believe the victim was involved in an incident in the venue and that this may have been the prompt for his killing.

Police officers on the scene yesterday after a girl, believed to be aged 15, was arrested over a murder in Luton

Three other people died after being attacked at New Year's Eve Parties.

A teenage girl was being held on suspicion of stabbing a middle-aged man to death at a house party.

He suffered a heart attack after being knifed at the party and died within an hour.

Detectives today arrested a girl believed to be aged around 15 on suspicion of carrying out the attack.

Police were initially unable to question many of the guests at the party because they were drunk.

Neighbours told how at 3am they heard 'loads of screaming' coming from the house party and then squads of police and a paramedic crew arrived.

One neighbour said a lot of teenagers and adults had attended the party.

'They were playing music throughout the night which wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary,' she said.

'Then the music suddenly stopped and there was a lot of shouting and fighting.

'You could hear people fighting. Then there were these awful screams and people running from the house in a state.

'A group of girls were the first to come out and they bolted down an alleyway at the bottom of the road.'

Police had sealed of a large section of the quiet cul-de-sac as forensic teams worked in the house and back garden.
