A man accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol called a television station from jail and said if he hadn't been arrested he would have gone to Washington and shot President Barack Obama in the head.

WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization.

The station aired part of the interview on Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial.

Cornell said in the interview that both he and ISIS members worked together on the terror plot, which involved planting pipe bombs and going on a public shooting rampage.

Reporter Tricia Macke asked Cornell in the interview 'Was it their idea for you to plant pipe bombs at the Capitol and have people running outside to shoot them?'

'It was mix of both of our ideas,' Cornell answered.

Christopher Lee Cornell allegedly plotted to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington and kill government officials inside it and spoke of his desire to support the Islamic State militant group

Cornell, asked by Macke what he would have done had he not been arrested in January, said he would have taken one of his guns, 'I would have put it to Obama's head, I would have pulled the trigger, then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members, and I would have attacked the Israeli embassy and various other buildings.'

Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State.'

He said: 'They might say I'm a terrorist, but you know we see American troops as terrorists as well, coming to our land, stealing our resources and killing our people, raping our women.'

Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, grew up in the Cincinnati suburbs and still lived with his parents. He said support of the Islamic State group is widespread.

'We're here in Ohio. We're in every state,' he said. 'We're more organized than you think.'

He said that if he hadn't been caught, he would have attacked, President Barack Obama, the Senate, the House of Representatives and many other places in the nation's capital

At times what seemed like a nervous chuckle punctuated his responses. He said he would do whatever the Islamic State group asked of him, including beheading Americans, and predicted 'there will be many, many attacks'.

A federal indictment charges Cornell with two counts that carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each upon conviction: attempted murder of government employees and officials and solicitation to commit a crime of violence.

He also faces a firearms-related charge. He has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in Cincinnati.

Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition.

The FBI said in court documents that Cornell planned to 'wage jihad' by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees.

Cornell was coerced and misled by 'a snitch' trying to better his own legal situation, his father said.

Cornell warned the news station that there were Islamic State group supporters in almost all of the United States

He described his son as a 'mommy's boy' who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was 'at peace' after becoming a practicing Muslim.

'He was dragged into this,' Cornell said before the hearing. 'He was coerced.'

His son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013.

The FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should 'wage jihad,' authorities said in court papers.

Similar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences.
