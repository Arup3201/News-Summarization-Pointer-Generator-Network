A woman has been arrested after stealing a man's $25,000 Rolex by hiding it in her vagina, New York police have said.

Shacarye Tims, 25, had been invited to the man’s room at a Holiday Inn in Chelsea, Manhattan, in the early hours of Sunday.

Tims had made the man remove the luxury watch from his wrist because it ‘scratched’ her, after which she stole it from the nightstand.

Brazen theft: Shacarye Tims, 25, robbed the man of his $25,000 luxury watch after he invited her back to his hotel room at a Holiday Inn in Manhattan.

The unnamed man told police he had invited Tims to his room at 5.30am on Sunday morning after meeting her in a bar.

He had placed the Rolex on the nightstand after she convinced him to take it off, and ‘ten minutes later’ it was missing, DNAinfo New York reports.

Tims allegedly told him it might have fallen on the floor and while he was looking for the watch, she ran away.

The man caught up with her in the lobby, but when he grabbed her, she ‘hit him over the head several times with a closed fist,’ the criminal complaint reads.

Tims was arrested and later handed over the Rolex which she had ‘hidden in her vaginal cavity’.

Tims has been charged with robbery and grand larceny and is being held on $10,000 bail. She is due in court on Friday.

Holiday Inn has not commented on the incident.
