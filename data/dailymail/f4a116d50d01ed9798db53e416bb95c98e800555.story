Mesut Ozil has confirmed he injured his hamstring after just two minutes in Arsenal's Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich and faces six weeks on the sidelines.

Sportsmail revealed the news yesterday and the Germany international has now confirmed this on his official Facebook page.

Gunners fans will be furious he remained on the pitch with an injury, just one week after Jack Wilshere broke his foot but played on during England's friendly with Denmark.

Benched: Mesut Ozil was substituted at half-time against Bayern Munich in the Champions League clash

Out of sorts: Ozil was underwhelming in the first half at the Allianz Arena

Arsenal face league fixtures over the next month against Tottenham, Chelsea, Swansea City, Manchester City and Everton.

Ozil said: 'Now it's clear: during the #ucl match against #FCBayern I suffered a muscle injury in the second minute.

'I tried to give my best and played until the end of the first half. rest assured that I'll be back even stronger!'

Bad news: Ozil confirms on Twitter that he injured his hamstring very early in the match with Bayern

Arsene Wenger predicted on Tuesday night that the playmaker would be out for 'at least a few weeks' and said he would know more after further tests on Wednesday.

With the manager's fears now realised, Arsenal's record signing faces an uphill battle to be fit for the club's FA Cup semi-final clash with Wigan Athletic on April 12 as they attempt to end their nine-year trophy drought.

The worst-case scenario is that he will also miss the April league matches against Hull City and Newcastle United, and will not return until early May.

Game on: But Lukas Podolski's equaliser had little bearing on the overall result

Speaking about Ozil in the immediate after of the Gunners’ Champions League exit, Wenger said: 'He has a hamstring injury that looks quite serious. I don’t know how long he will be out. For sure, he is out of Spurs.

'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he is out at least for a few weeks. I hope it’s not too bad.'

Blow: Arsene Wenger could be without Ozil for six weeks

Ozil's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of Wenger's squad.

Wilshere will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on international duty last week and Theo Walcott is out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

Aaron Ramsey is still not fully fit after being sidelined since December 26 with a thigh injury.
