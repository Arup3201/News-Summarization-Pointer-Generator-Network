An 18-year-old child care student only realised she was pregnant when she gave birth on her parents' bathroom floor, it was revealed today.

Jessica Elikowski, of Blurton, Staffordshire, even underwent keyhole surgery six months into her pregnancy after suffering back and knee pain - caused by her unborn child growing near her spine.

She had been off sick with back trouble from college - where she is studying to become a nursery nurse - but woke up to go to the toilet and, after feeling an urge to push, gave birth to 7lb 6oz Lexi.

Miss Elikowski said: ‘I had no idea I was pregnant - which is amazing considering I'm actually studying child care and pregnancy at college.

‘I had really bad knee and back pain which I thought was a result of an injury I suffered in 2012. The doctors said I needed key-hole surgery to realign my knee cap.

‘But the pain didn't go away until I suddenly gave birth three months later. Everything happened really quickly. I had a couple of days off college because I was having really bad pains in my back.

‘I went to the toilet a few times and I had a bit of pain but I thought it was period pain. My mum came in to check I was okay and realised something was wrong.

‘I was pushing for about 15 minutes and my daughter was born. My mum caught her and unwrapped the umbilical cord from around her neck. We were all in shock.

'I had absolutely no idea I was pregnant. I had gone to a couple of weddings in fitted dresses and there was no sign of a bump. When I went for my surgery, the doctors didn't do a pregnancy test because I was on my period. But they tested me for just about everything else.

'I'm relieved the pain has gone now and even happier that I've got little Lexi to show for it.’

Miss Elikowski underwent a two-hour operation to realign her knee cap at University Hospital of North Staffordshire on October 24.

'I didn't really understand what was happening until she was born. I caught her and she was crying but she had the cord wrapped around her neck'

Her mother Barbara, 46, a dinner lady, said: ‘It was such a surprise. I didn't really understand what was happening until she was born.

‘I caught her and she was crying but she had the cord wrapped around her neck. I was very gentle and I removed it and the paramedics arrived very quickly and they took over from there.

‘I just couldn't believe it. But now I rush home to see Lexi after work and I love helping out with her. She's quite a quiet and happy baby, a miracle really. I'm very proud of Jess for everything she's been through.’
