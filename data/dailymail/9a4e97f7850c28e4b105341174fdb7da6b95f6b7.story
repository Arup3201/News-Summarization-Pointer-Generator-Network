As heists go, it was hardly the scheme of the century.

CCTV footage has caught the moment a would-be art thief walked into a gallery in Birmingham, before casually plucking a piece of valuable First World War art from the wall.

Having perhaps not thought the robbery through properly, the video shows the opportunistic thief trying to stuff the large painting under his hooded jumper, before giving up and tucking it under his arm and sauntering towards the exit.

Unfortunately for him staff spotted the large frame under his arms has he tried to make his way out of the museum doors.

Investigating officer, PC Patrick Higgins said: 'The thief was quite optimistic in his attempts to conceal the artwork, valued at several hundred pounds, but fortunately he made off empty handed.

'We are now keen to identify the man in the CCTV to prevent him from turning his attention to smaller objects.'

The artwork which the crook attempted to steal was entitled ‘Never Forgotten’ by Nic Joly.

The sculpture, depicting two soldiers raising a red poppy, was mounted in a frame.

The original ‘Never Forgotten’ piece was sold at a charity auction for veterans for £7,500.

Now the 1,566 limited edition copies of the art are hoped to fetch £695 each, with £100 from each one being donated to the Royal British Legion.

A spokesman for Castle Galleries said: 'On Sunday August 17, during our trading hours, a man made an attempt to steal a piece of artwork from our Castle Fine Art, ICC gallery.

As heists go, it was hardly comparable to the Thomas Crown Affair, the film about a millionaire businessman playboy who sets up a heist to steal priceless art from a museum

'We
 were saddened at this attempted theft most particularly because the 
piece in question, ‘Never Forgotten’ by British sculptor Nic Joly, was 
created as a limited edition to commemorate the recent First World War 
centenary.

'One hundred 
pounds from each sale will be donated to The Royal British Legion in 
support of the excellent work they do for the British Armed Forces past 
and present.

'This gallery, 
and all of our galleries, are fitted with the latest CCTV technology and
 our staff are fully trained to deal with many types of situation, such 
as theft, safely, without putting themselves at risk.

'In this instance, the gallery’s manager witnessed the man take the artwork off the wall and leave the gallery.

'She
 then approached the man and got the artwork from him, with no 
confrontation or difficultly. The incident was then promptly reported to
 the Police.

'We’re working 
with the West Midlands Police and if anyone has any information or 
recognises the man, we urge them to get in touch with the Police 
directly.

'It is Castle
 Galleries’ company policy that anyone caught of a crime against the 
business will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'

Police
 are appealing for anyone who recognises the man to call 101 or 
alternatively information can be given anonymously to Crimestoppers on 
0800 555 111.
