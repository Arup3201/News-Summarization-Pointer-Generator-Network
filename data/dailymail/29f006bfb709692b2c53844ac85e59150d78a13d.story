AC Milan have opened the door for star striker Mario Balotelli to move to Arsenal after refusing to rule out selling the Italian forward.

Balotelli has been strongly linked with a move away from the San Siro this summer, despite having four years left on his contract, and Arsene Wenger is thought to have sanctioned a move for the former Manchester City man.

Reports in Italy claim Milan are prepared to sell Balotelli for a fee close to £30million.

'Balotelli is a great player,' AC Milan vice-president Barbara Berlusconi said on the club’s official website.

'But the way I see it, I don’t believe that someone can be irreplaceable.

'We will see what happens.'

Balotelli, who is also a target for Napoli, is said to be open to a Premier League return after his previous spell with City.

The 23-year-old played almost three seasons in Manchester before being sold to AC Milan for £20million in January 2013.

The Italians would expect to recoup that fee and more for one of Europe's most sought after young strikers.

Balotelli scored 14 goals in 30 league appearances for Milan in the 2013-14 season but could only help them to finish a disappointing eighth meaning they will not play in Europe next term.
