The Duke of Edinburgh has made it on to a list of best-dressed men - topped by DJ Nick Grimshaw.

Philip, 92, is 26th in GQ's Best-Dressed Men List, alongside the likes of One Direction star Harry Styles in 11th, retired footballer David Beckham in 13th and actor Jude Law in 20th.

Radio 1 Breakfast DJ Grimshaw has the top spot, followed by The Avengers star Tom Hiddleston and Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch.

Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom actor Idris Elba is fourth, with former Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens in fifth place.

The top 10 is completed by rapper Tinie Tempah, X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, Arctic Monkeys' frontman Alex Turner, fashion designer Charlie Casely-Hayford and model David Gandy.

GQ said that Philip ‘deserves yet another medal - for his services to classic British tailoring’.

Deputy editor Bill Prince added: ‘Top-down management still rules among the royals, evidenced by the degree to which the Duke of Edinburgh's sons, grandsons (and, who knows, great-grandson) hero-worship his time-honoured style.’

Not so good: In the worst-dressed category, fashion designer Ozwald Boateng (left) tops the list, followed by politician George Galloway (right)

The Prince of Wales was in eighth place last year but is not in the current list.

In the worst-dressed category, fashion designer Ozwald Boateng tops the list, followed by politician George Galloway, TV scientist Brian Cox and former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers.

Dancer-turned-I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! contestant Vincent Simone (5th), MasterChef's Gregg Wallace (8th) and UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (10th) also feature.

The poll was voted for by staff at GQ and a panel of experts from the worlds of fashion and celebrity, including Giorgio Armani, Tom Ford, Sir Roger Moore and Donatella Versace.

It comes after the US edition of men's magazine Esquire named Pope Francis as its Best Dressed Man of 2013. The magazine admitted the decision was 'unconventional' but claimed his simple manner of dressing has 'signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church'.

The full Best-Dressed Men List is in the February 2014 issue of GQ, available from Thursday January 2
