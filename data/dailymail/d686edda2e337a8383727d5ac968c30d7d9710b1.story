Fiorentina have rejected Chelsea's offer of £20.6million  for wideman Juan Cuadrado.

The Italians have insisted they will not accept bids below the £26.8m release clause in the Colombian's contract but Chelsea will hold further discussions over the next 24 hours.

They are awaiting improved offers from Roma on Mohamed Salah and from Wolfsburg on Andre Schurrle before taking the next step.

Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah has been linked with a move to Roma but Fiorentina have also enquired

Fiorentina have cut short the loan of Chelsea’s Marko Marin, who joined Anderlecht on Tuesday, and have asked about Salah themselves though the Egyptian favours a move to Roma. 

Cuadrado's agent Alessandro Lucci is scheduled to fly to London on Wednesday once he has tied up the transfer of Luis Muriel from Udinese to Sampdoria.

Cuadrado - who scored a penalty in Fiorentina's 3-1 Italian Cup  victory over Atalanta on Wednesday- can play on either flank and can also operate as a wing-back. Although he has not been in the best of form this season, he has experience, good pace and works for his team.

He finished the World Cup alongside Toni Kroos with the most assists.
