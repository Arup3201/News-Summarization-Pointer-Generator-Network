The number of sickening child abuse images found on the internet has doubled in a year, a report has found.

As Britain's internet giants face growing demands to do more to block indecent images, experts said 70,000 pictures and videos of children being abused were discovered last year - double the 2011 figure of 35,000.

The annual study by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre also highlighted a growing problem: vulnerable families in developing countries streaming live abuse of their children via webcam in exchange for cash from paedophiles.

It also found that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the number of images featuring girls under the age of 10, and a 125 per cent increase in the number of Level 4 images - which feature sex with children - on the internet.

In its annual threat assessment of child sexual exploitation and abuse, CEOP said the rape and sexual assault of children being shown live over the internet was an emerging problem, and said that paedophiles were increasingly using sophisticated software to hide their illegal activities.

Many are said to use heavily encrypted networks and other security measures to hide their abuse pictures within the 'hidden internet'.

Peter Davies, chief executive of CEOP, said: ‘Our assessment shows that, sadly, there are still too many children at risk and too many people who would cause them serious harm.

‘While the assessment may not make comfortable reading, that isn’t its purpose. It’s an objective assessment of the issues as we see them but as a result it is also, undoubtedly, a call to action.

‘We should all practise zero tolerance to child sexual exploitation and abuse.’

The ease with which paedophiles can find sickening images has come under scrutiny in recent months following the convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the murders of five-year-old April Jones and 12-year-old Tia Sharp.

Both men had visited child abuse sites before the attacks. The parents of both children have called for more action to tackle the problem.

CEOP warned that one in 58 children in the UK will be abused by someone who is not a relative before they turn 18.  And it says an estimated 50,000 web users are involved in distributing the sickening images in Britain.

There are 10,000 fresh cases of children being abuse being reported in Britain each year, it found.

Justice minister Damian Green said: 
‘These figures are deeply troubling and show how our understanding of 
child sexual exploitation has greatly improved in recent years.

'More needs to be done. Together, as communities, we need to ensure these sickening crimes no longer remain hidden'

‘Police are bringing more cases before the courts and significant sentences are being handed down to perpetrators. But more needs to be done.

'Together, as communities, we need to ensure these sickening crimes no longer remain hidden.’

An NSPCC spokesman added: ‘The evidence the NSPCC has gathered from all police forces in England and Wales shows there are around 20,000 sexual offences against children reported every year and many of the victims are under primary-school age.

‘However, we believe this is far from the true situation as many cases are never revealed. And since the (Jimmy) Savile sex crimes were revealed, our helpline has experienced an increase in the number of adults reporting cases which happened many years, even decades, earlier.

‘While there are cases of children being sexually assaulted by strangers, the vast majority of these offences - around nine out of 10 - are committed by someone the child knows.’
