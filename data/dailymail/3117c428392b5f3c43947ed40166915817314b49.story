A great-grandmother who lost her wedding ring more than 42 years ago is overjoyed after finding it buried just two inches below soil in her garden.

Marion Reeve, 79, from East Halton, North Lincolnshire, lost her wedding ring back in 1971, while hanging out the washing in her back garden.

Despite searching for the ring for years, she and husband William finally accepted they would never see it again.

But almost half a century on, Mrs Reeve has been reunited with the ring - after a family friend asked to try out their new metal detector in her garden.

She said: 'It was so emotional when I got my ring back. I just couldn’t believe it. It was brilliant and I honestly thought it was gone forever.

'I was not exactly sure where I had lost it all those years ago. I had been hanging out the washing in the orchard, but it could have been anywhere.'

Mrs Reeve lost her wedding ring 15 years after marring farmer William Reeve, and the couple, who have three children, would occassionally search for the ring throughout the years.

Mrs Reeve, who was married to her husband for 54 years, before he passed away four years ago, said: 'People say it is bad luck to lose a wedding ring, but William said it did not matter.'

But four decades after losing it, family friend and metal detector enthusiast Chris Blackburn, 34, from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, discovered the gold ring, just two inches below the soil in her back garden.

He said: 'It was in remarkably good condition. The family have thanked me, but just finding it was a reward in itself and to see the look on Marion’s face.'

Mr Blackburn became friends with Mrs Reeve's eldest son Neville and would regularly scour land belonging to the family with his metal detector- although he only ever found old cans or small bits of metal.

During the festive period Mr Blackburn came to have another look and miraculously discovered the missing ring.

Mrs Reeve was upstairs sorting clothes when she looked out of the window and saw Mr Blackburn digging.

She said: 'I thought ‘Has he found a body?’

'Then when he came into the house and said ‘Is this yours?’ I went a bit emotional.'

Mrs Reeve's son Neville said: 'It had only been a couple of inches in the ground. He struck lucky. He was over the moon. It was in remarkably good condition considering it had been there 42 years.

'It is really good news. It had been lost all those years are we searched everywhere as children and never managed to find it.

'It is a miracle.'
