A trainee lawyer from Siberia has won the title of the longest legs in Russia with her incredible gazelle-like 106cm pins.

Anastasia Strashevskaya, 18, from Novosibirsk, has been voted 'Miss Longest Legs' in a Russian national beauty contest.

Miss Strashevskaya won a £1,600 prize after beating 52 other contestants to win the title in the competition which also included categories Miss Bikini, Miss Sport, Miss Smile, and Miss Blonde.

Another Siberian, Benazir Zhamalova, 20, also a student in Novosibirsk, won the title Miss Brunette.

Miss Strashevskaya, a student from the Novosibirsk Institute of Law, has vows not to be distracted by modelling offers or sudden fame after her win in an online poll run by Miss Russia.

She said: 'I have wanted to be a lawyer since school and deliberately came to this institute.

'I will not leave it under any circumstances and in the future I want to engage in civil law.

'Part of the money, I plan to spend on a gift for my parents and more I want to donate to children with cancer.

under any circumstances and in the future I want to engage in civil 
law.'

Between law lectures, 
Miss Strashevskaya told The Siberian Times: 'This victory gave me a 
great joy, because I was dreaming about this. In fact, for me, it's like
 a dream.

'Right now I do not feel like a winner, nothing has changed, my life goes on.

'My family is very proud of me! I just believed in my fairy tale and in my dream - and it happened.

'It was my decision to take part in this competition, but my friends supported me very much.'
