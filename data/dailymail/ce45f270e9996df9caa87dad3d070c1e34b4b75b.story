Axed: Jeppe Hansen, 22, was forced to leave the Royal Winnipeg Ballet school in Canada after lecturers discovered he was starring in online gay porn

A dancer has been kicked out of a prestigious ballet school after lecturers discovered he had been starring in gay porn.

Jeppe Hansen, 22, endured gruelling auditions to secure his coveted spot in the professional division at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet school in Canada.

But the dancer claims he was forced to leave the school after they discovered his extracurricular work - starring in online pornography under the stage name Jett Black.

Hansen, originally from Denmark, said
he was made to sign a letter stating he was voluntarily withdrawing 
from the organisation before escorting him off the premises.

He told the National Post: 'I was definitely kicked out of school. They didn’t really give me any options.

'They
actually stated that they knew what was going on and they didn’t 
approve of it and they couldn’t have me at the school any longer.'

Hansen
had years of experience in the Royal Danish Opera and The Ballet in 
Tivoli Gardens - even performing for the Queen of Denmark - before 
joining the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

But he started working for a website called CockyBoys in February to expand his repertoire.

His profile on the website reads: 'Jett 
Black has been an artist his entire life. He loves to move his body and 
perform in front of other people, so you can see why making porn is no 
different to him.

'In
fact, being naked on screen adds another layer of depth when he’s 
expressing himself, a certain "raw passion" he says, that he’s proud to 
share with the world.

Some of Hansen's classmates discovered images relating to his work as a porn star on Tumblr and alerted the school's artistic director.

The dancer was called in for a meeting in March and told he would have to leave the school.

Hansen, who now lives in New York, said: 'I don’t blame the Winnipeg Ballet. I grew up in the ballet world, I know how conservative and high brow, as they call it, it is. I do understand to a certain degree why they made the decision they did.'

Hansen is now concentrating on furthering his adult movie career but still performs ballet in his spare time to keep fit.

The Royal Winnipeg Ballet told CBC: 'The organization has policies and procedures in place for the benefit of all.'
