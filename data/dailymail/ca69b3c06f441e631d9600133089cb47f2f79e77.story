Owen Williams wants to extend his stay at Leicester and compete for a place in the Wales team from the Aviva Premiership.

Having moved to Welford Road as a complete unknown last year, the fly-half has been one of the club’s stand-out performers, seeing off competition from England internationals Toby Flood and Freddie Burns during his first two seasons.

The 22-year-old is at an advanced stage in contract negotiations and told Sportsmail that he is prepared to stay in the East Midlands, even though a return across the border would boost his chances of being selected for Wales.

Leicester fly half Owen Williams was Man of the Match in his side's 25-21 win over Toulon at Welford Road 

‘I’m happy to stay at this club,’ said Williams. ‘If it means playing in front of 24,000 people every week and playing in big games, then I want to play for Leicester. Hopefully it doesn’t affect my Wales chances in the future but we’ll see how it goes.

‘The Premiership is a tough league and there are no easy games. Every week is a grind and, after two years at the club, I like to think I have improved a bit. I just want to win things with Leicester and if I’m doing well, then all good. I’ve not heard anything from Wales.’

If Williams does pen a new deal with Leicester it will be a blow of Wales coach Warren Gatland who is keen to have the best talent playing for one of the four Regions. 

Northampton winger George North has a a full international release clause to allow him to play for Wales 

After a bitter stand-off between the Welsh Rugby Union and the clubs, a peace deal has now been signed and a batch of central contracts have been offered to the best players under the new Rugby Services Agreement (RSA). 

The spin-off is that regions only pay 40 per cent of player salaries and, as a result, Gatland has control over when they are available for international duty.

It is a positive step forwards with regard to retaining young players but, in the case of Williams, there are questions over whether a return to Wales would stunt the rapid development he has enjoyed in the Aviva Premiership. 

Ospreys number 10 Dan Biggar is currently first choice fly half for Warren Gatland's Wales team 

If the youngster does sign a new deal, he is likely to request a full international release clause, similar to that of George North at Northampton.

Williams is the first out-of-contract player since the RSA was agreed and the risk is that Gatland makes an example out of the playmaker, to set a precedent, if he does re-sign at Leicester.

Who should fill the No 10 jersey has been a long-term problem for Gatland, although Dan Biggar is the stand-out choice going into the Six Nations after his stellar performances in the autumn internationals. 

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill has backed Williams's decision to stay with the Tigers 

But there is a lack of competition — Rhys Priestland, Gareth Anscombe and Rhys Patchell are among the next in line — and Williams’ club performances, including a man-of-the-match display in last week’s victory over Toulon, make him an obvious choice.

‘The reality is if you are the best player you are going to play for your country,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. 

‘I want Owen to play for Wales. He can play for Wales whilst playing for this club. I know there are issues around release, but that can be worked out. At this point, the best thing for Owen is to stay here and play in this team.’
