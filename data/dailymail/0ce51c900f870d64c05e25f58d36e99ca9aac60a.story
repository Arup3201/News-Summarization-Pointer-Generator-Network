These underwater photographs might look like they were taken under the waves of exotic seas but they were actually snapped in a British canal situated under the M1 motorway.

Photographer Jack Perk, 21, captured these stunning images of Britain’s most popular freshwater fish, which include bullheads, chubs and gudgeons.

Astonishingly, despite living next to Britain’s busiest road and close to a sewage pipe, the fish enjoy a rich habitat in extraordinary crystal-clear water.

Picturesque: A group of Grayling fish are pictured swimming in the green canal water overlooked by the M1 motorway

Water under the bridge: A Nottingham canal running under the M1 motorway is the unlikely home to some of Britain's favourite freshwater fish -such as minnows, right

Patience is a virtue: Photographer Jack Perk spent five hours standing in the freezing canal to capture pictures of a vast array of British fish - including this one of a chub

Jack spent five hours standing in the freezing canal near his home in Silverdale, Nottingham, to capture the pictures which will be showcased in a BBC wildlife documentary.

He said: 'Fish are an under-rated subject. I used to go fishing with my grandad when I was a little boy and I still go with him now sometimes.

'There are not many people that do underwater filming like I do. I get unusual photos that people really like.

'Some people are really surprised when I tell them they are taken in a canal under a motorway. It just goes to show that beauty can exist in such a mundane setting.

'When it all comes together, it’s a great achievement.

The man himself: Wildilfe photographer Jack Perk stood for hours in the canal getting up close and personal with wildlife for a new BBC series

Point of interest: Jack Perk hopes his underwater snaps of fish, including this gudgeon, will put Nottingham on the map for its natural habitats

The murky depths: Jack Perk studied photography at South Nottingham College and at Falmouth University College to learn how to capture the perfect underwater snaps - such as this one of a bullhead

Ready for your close up?: Every detail of this beautiful bullhead is seen in stunning clarity in this close up picture

Fintastic: While this beautiful picture of a bream may look like it was taken in exotic waters, it was actually captured in a British canal

'I like recording their behaviour and then we can understand it - it’s very important.'

Jack studied photography at South Nottingham College before pursuing a photography degree at University College, Falmouth.

He was even shortlisted for the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year award while at college - for a photo of an angel shark taken on holiday in Lanzarote.

He added: 'The nomination made me think I could actually do something. I was very proud of getting the TV deal as well. It felt great.

'None of my family are really interested in photography, it’s just something that I have found on my own.'

Hidden treasure: Pictured is the canal in Nottingham, overlooked by the M1 motorway where young wildilfe photographer Jack Perk took the incredible images

Not so natural: Despite the motorway and people doing graffiti (pictured) in the area, nature has managed to prevail

Unlikely: Jack Perk's underwater snaps of fish are set to put Nottingham on the map for its natural habitats

What are you looking at? Jack captured this close up of a swan. The majority of his pictures were shot in the same area

childhood passion: Jack Perk, 21, says he has always had a fascination with fish after going fishing with his grandfather when he was little

Pucker up: A curious barbel appears to investigate Jack Perk and his underwater camera

Spot the difference: A male minnow which are often found in large groups in fast flowing fresh water streams

A great achievement: One of Jack's pictures is of a dace swimming near the bottom of the canal
