Detectives have asked prosecutors to decide whether to charge a man with the murder of Melanie Hall, who was last seen in a Bath nightclub in June 1996

Detectives have asked prosecutors to consider charging a man with the murder of university graduate Melanie Hall nearly 20 years ago.

The 45-year-old, who was arrested on suspicion of the 25-year-old's murder last year, remains on police bail.

Avon and Somerset Police said a file of evidence had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service and the force was waiting for a charging decision.

Miss Hall, who worked at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, vanished after a night out at Cadillacs nightclub in Walcot Street, Bath, in June 1996.

In 2009 her remains were found by the side of the M5 by a workman who was clearing vegetation on the slip road at junction 14, near Thornbury, south Gloucestershire.

Earlier this year, police appealed for information about the owner of the white VW Golf GTi hardtop, reg C752 CYE, during the summer of 1996.

An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'Detectives investigating the murder of the Bath woman Melanie Hall in 1996 have now asked the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision on whether to charge a suspect.

'A 45-year-old man, who was arrested at his home in the city last November on suspicion of murder, has today been further bailed until the beginning of December while the CPS considers the evidence against him.'

Nicola Haywood, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS South West, said: 'Avon and Somerset Police have handed a file to the CPS for consideration as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence on which to charge anyone in relation to the disappearance and death of Melanie Hall.'

Miss Hall's father, Steve, spoke last year of his hope that his daughter's killer would be brought to justice.

'Gradually the pieces of the jigsaw are being put together to bring Melanie's killer or killers to justice,' he said.

'We always knew it would take a long time, but these new developments appear very encouraging.

'It's time for whoever has information about Melanie's murder to come forward and bring this to an end - because it will come to an end eventually.

'The police won't give up until they get a result.'
