A father who strapped his one-month-old baby to a steering wheel, span it around and posted footage of the stunt online has been blasted by children's rights groups. 

Yong Liao,  39, was at a service station in western Taiwan's Miaoli county when he strapped the baby to the wheel of his car and spinned it back and forth. 

The baby's mother, Xia Lung, then posted the clip online to the horror of children's rights groups.

A father has been blasted by children's rights groups after sharing a video of his baby strapped to the wheel of a car 

After receiving a torrent of abuse, the 34-year-old removed the video, having responded to her critics: 'I don't know what everyone is complaining about, we weren't on a main road at the time, we were only at a service station.' 

Despite widespread criticism, social workers said no action would be taken against the couple. 

Throughout the brief video, Mr Liao and Miss Lung can be heard cooing and singing to the baby as it's rocked back and forth. 

The infant does not cry, but kicks its legs and makes a gargling sound when turned to be almost upside down.

Officials said while the video should not be imitated, it does not appear as though the baby's parents were trying to bring it any harm.  

Wang Wei-Jun, the director of the Taiwanese Committee for the Improvement of Children's Rights, said: 'Looking at the video, it does not seem as if there is intentional abuse of the child, although I think it's fair to say that the parents are a bad example for others and that the activity is certainly dangerous.'

Despite a torrent of abuse from online critics, Taiwanese officials said no action would be taken against the baby's parents as the video did not suggest that any harm had been done
