Memorial: Lady Thatcher herself gave her support to the plans for a library in her honour, which would also run student exchanges

A museum and library devoted to Margaret Thatcher is set to be opened as a permanent memorial to the former prime minister.

Supporters aim to raise £15million for the new institution, which will be based on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California.

The Margaret Thatcher Library, which will also include an educational centre, is supported by at least three Cabinet ministers as well as former colleagues of Baroness Thatcher.

The library will run training courses to educate the next generation of politicians in her core beliefs of low taxation, support for the individual over the state and the primacy of the free market.

Planning for the institution, which will also run exchange student programmes with the US and elsewhere, began in 2009.

It is expected to display artefacts from her years in power in the 1980s, including her handbags and her trademark blue Aquascutum suits.

Lady Thatcher herself gave her support to the plans, being overseen by the right-wing Conservative Way Forward group, during the final years of her life.

In a letter written in February, 2011 to her friend, Conor Burns, the Tory MP who is one of the prime movers behind the project, she wrote: ‘I am extremely interested in the proposals to emulate what is being done in America here in Britain.’

Mr Burns said: ‘The legacy she would most have wanted would have been a living legacy - teaching her beliefs to a new generation.’

Cabinet backers of the plan include Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, and David Jones, the Welsh Secretary.

Firm friends: Lady Thatcher could be honoured in a similar way to her ally former U.S. President Ronald Reagan by having a library in her memory

Inspiration: The Ronald W Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California

Lord Tebbit and Lord Parkinson, two key figures in Lady Thatcher’s Cabinets in the 1980s, have also endorsed the scheme, as have current Thatcherite figures including Liam Fox, the former defence secretary.

Mr Pickles said Lady Thatcher was a ‘giant among political leaders’, adding: ‘The establishment of the Margaret Thatcher Library as a last monument to her greatness is a worthy project that I am pleased to support.’

Memorabilia: Lady Thatcher's clothing and possessions from her premiership in the eighties will also go on display

Dr Fox said: ‘This project will ensure that people across the world will have a base at which to learn about Margaret Thatcher’s remarkable life and achievements.’

Lord Parkinson said: ‘This will conserve Lady Thatcher’s legacy and teach a whole new generation about the importance of the work she did as prime minister.’

Ron Robinson, the president of the Reaganite Young America’s Foundation, said: ‘It is critical that Margaret Thatcher’s legacy is protected for future generations. Like her great friend Ronald Reagan, she knew that freedom was never more than one generation away from extinction.’
