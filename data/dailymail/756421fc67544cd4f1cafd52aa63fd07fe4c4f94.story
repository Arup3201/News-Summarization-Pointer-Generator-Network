The remains will be examined to confirm that they are human, Lancashire Constabulary said.

Inspector Keith Lee, of Preston Police, said: 'While it is not clear how these remains came to be left in the cemetery, I think it is likely there is a vulnerable young mother out there and possibly a new baby.

'If that is the case then I would appeal directly to them to come forward and contact police.

'We are not here to judge but it may be that the mother and her baby need some medical help.'

Police also appealed to any 'concerned' family members of health professional to get in touch, even if they have 'the smallest amount of information which could help us'.
