Federal lawmakers are lining up to tell President Barack Obama to fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki now that an inspector general report has confirmed that a Phoenix, Arizona,VA hospital lied about how long veterans were waiting for care.

'If Secretary Shinseki does not step down voluntarily, then I call 
on the president of the United States to relieve him of his duties, to 
fire him,' Arizona Senator John McCain, a Republican, said during at a press conference this afternoon at his Phoenix office.

Today's report 'makes it clear that 
the systemic problems' at the VA 'are so entrenched that they require 
new leadership to be fixed,' Colorado Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, said in a 
statement. 'Secretary Shinseki must step down.'

'Sec.
 Shinseki has proven time and again he is not that leader. That’s why 
it’s time for him to go,' House Veteran's Affairs committee chairman Jeff Miller, a Republican from Florida, chimed in.

An Inspector General report released today found that at least 1,700 veterans 
were put on secret waiting lists at the VA health care system in Phoenix, Arizona.

This is the same facility that is linked to the deaths of 40 veterans who perished while waiting for care.

Managers of the Phoenix VA Health Care System claimed veterans were only waiting two weeks to a month for appointments, when in reality they were often waiting an average of 115 days to be seen by VA doctors for the first time, the IG's review found.

And that's just the results from the initial report. A total of 26 VA hospitals are now under investigation.

'With the launch of inspections of VA 
facilities nationwide, it’s time to put the partisanship aside and focus
 on what’s right for our veterans,' Montana Senator John Walsh said.

'It is time for President Obama to remove Secretary Shinseki from office,' the Democratic congressman said in a statement.

'The IG report tells us info we already knew from a 2013 report,' Republican Senator Jerry Moran, a longtime member of Congress' Veterans Affairs committees, tweeted. 'How many
 more studies is it going to take for this Admin to take action?'

Shinseki said in a statement that the initial findings of the IG report were 'reprehensible.'

He noted that the VA has been conducting an internal review of the Phoenix hospital since April and officials there are already on leave. But no one from the facility will be fired at this time, he said.

'It is important to allow OIG’s independent and objective review to proceed until completion,' Shinseki said. 'OIG has requested that VA take no additional personnel actions in Phoenix until their review is complete.'

Since the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's interim report was released yesterday, a slew of lawmakers have called on Shinseki, right, to resign. Shinseki is pictured here on Memorial Day during a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia

Since the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's interim report was released today, a slew of other lawmakers have called on Shinseki to resign and many have also called for the Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation.

'Leadership starts at the top,' Montana Rep. Steve Daines, a Democrat, tweeted.

'The horrific misconduct that occurred under the watch of Secretary 
Shinseki is unacceptable and leaves our Veterans untrusting of the 
department,' Rep. Dennis Ross, a Democrat from Florida, said.

Arizona Democratic Rep. Krysten Sinema called the report 'unconscionable' and Republican Rep. Paul Gosar said the VA's behavior was 'disgraceful,
despicable
and
dangerous.'

'This is a sad day for our nation and the only 
fitting response in the short-term is for the President to direct the 
FBI to investigate these reports immediately,' Texas Senator John Cornyn said in a statement.

Department of Justice chief Eric Holder had said previously his agency had no plans to look into the VA scandal. Today's report could change his calculus, however.

'These allegations are 
not just administrative problems. These are criminal problems,' McCain said during today's presser. 'We need 
the FBI and the Department of Justice to be involved in this 
investigation.'

Leading Veterans group the American Legion had already called for Shinseki to step down over the initial allegations.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America founder Paul Rieckhoff said today that the IG report was 'damning and outrageous.'

'It also reveals the need for a criminal investigation,' he said. 'The VA’s problems are broad and deep - and President Obama and his team haven’t demonstrated they can fix it.'

He said he was withholding issuing a statement on Shinseki specifically until he took the temperature of other members of his group, though.

President Obama said at a press conference last week that he would wait to see the results of the VA's investigation before making any decisions about Secretary Shinseki.

'At this stage, Rick is committed to solving the problem, and working with us to do it,' Obama said, fondly referring to Shinseki by his nickname.

'And
 I know that Rick, his attitude is, if he does not think he can do a 
good job on this, and if he thinks he's let our veterans down, then I am
 sure that he is not gonna be interested in committing to serve,' Obama continued.

The President peppered the VA secretary with with praise even as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were urging him to take bold act.

The president has not yet commented on the release of the Inspector General report today, however, Deputy 
National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN this afternoon that 
President Obama finds today's report 'deeply troubling.'

The senior administration official would not say where the president stands on Shinseki's job status, saying only, 'We're focused on making 
sure these veterans who've delivered for this country get the care they 
need.'
