A Hong Kong woman who tortured her Indonesian maid in a case that sparked outrage around the world has been convicted of a string of assault charges.

A judge found Law Wan-tung guilty of 18 charges including grievous bodily harm, criminal intimidation and failure to pay wages or give time off work to Erwiana Sulistyaningsih.

Ms Sulistyaningsih's case highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants working as domestic staff across Asia and the Middle East.

District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said she was 'sure' Law, seen above leaving the court last month, did assault, wound and threaten Ms Sulistyaningsih as charged 

It gained widespread attention about a year ago after photos of her injuries circulated among Indonesians in Hong Kong. They showed her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations, and blackened, peeling skin around her feet.

District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said that based on Ms Sulistyaningsih's testimony and that of other witnesses, 'I am sure the defendant did assault, wound and threaten (Sulistyaningsih) as charged'.

The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth; jammed a metal vacuum cleaner tube in her mouth, cutting her lip; and hit her on the back with a feather duster when she was sleeping. Law also forced the maid to stand naked in the bathroom during winter while she splashed water on and pointed a fan at her.

Ms Sulistyaningsih, who worked for Law for about eight months starting in June 2013, wasn't allowed any days off and was not paid her salary.

Law was found not guilty of two other charges. She was ordered to pay about £2,400 in outstanding wages to Ms Sulistyaningsih. Law was remanded into custody and is scheduled to be sentenced on February 27.

After the verdict supporters applauded Ms Sulistyaningsih who said she was happy 'because I will get the justice from Hong Kong'.

There are about 330,000 foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, almost all female and most from the Philippines or Indonesia, earning a minimum wage of about £328 a month.
