Bangladesh are on course to whitewash Zimbabwe in their Test series despite some late-in-the-day resolve from the tourists.

Declaring their second innings on 319-5, Bangladesh set a fanciful target of 449 that looked even more improbable when Zimbabwe lost Brian Chari four runs into their chase on day four.

But Sikandar Raza (43 not out) and Hamilton Masakadza (26 no) got the visitors to 71-1 at the close, meaning Bangladesh will at least have to dig deep to wrap up a 3-0 clean sweep.

A fourth Test hundred from rising star Mominul Haque did for them in Chittagong on Saturday, the 23-year-old posting a fourth century in only 12 Tests.

He was unbeaten on 131 when his side were called in, having done more than enough damage.

Resuming on 23 without loss, Bangladesh were keen to crack on and so they did, despite Imrul Kayes going for 15, edging Tinashe Panyangara behind.

That brought Mominul to the crease and he and Tamim Iqbal put on 113 for the second wicket in just over 30 overs.

Tamim, a first-innings centurion, made a well-crafted 65 before he was cleaned up by Natsai M'shangwe.

Mohammad Mahmudullah joined Mominul and they added a 50 stand, before he went for 30, the second man to nick Panyangara to the keeper.

Shakib Al Hasan added 17 and departed to M'shangwe, but it mattered little as Mominul continued, reaching his hundred off 156 balls.

Mushfiqur Rahim made a rapid 46 from 30 balls alongside him but after he went, the captain was in no mood to see Shuvagata Hom build a stand and soon called his men back in.

Mominul ended with 131 from 189 balls and was soon celebrating with his team-mates in the field as Rubel Hossain trapped Chari leg before for a five-ball duck.

Raza and Masakadza at least made for a more comfortable night's sleep, but the writing appears to be on the wall.
