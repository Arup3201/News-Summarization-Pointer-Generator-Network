Talk about ripping the heart out of a home — or, in this case, a socking great country mansion in Norfolk.

Anmer Hall, the ten-bedroom bolt-hole that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are renovating, until recently boasted one of those stunning, hand-crafted kitchens that is the stuff of over-excitable dreams.

No luxury was spared: there was an £11,000 Aga, an £8,000 fridge and inset Belfast sinks. The floor space outstripped that of most entire homes, the work-tops were gleaming hardwood, even the draining board cost £275.

In short, it was the kind of room most families would die for. Not the Duchess.

Barely a week after we learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her Kensington Palace apartment, we hear that most of the £50,000 kitchen at Anmer is to go, in favour of the young royals’ ‘own taste’.

It is, of course, profligate madness — and as far as harmful reputations go, ‘Two Jags Prescott’ could well be outstripped by ‘Three Kitchens Kate’.

Not surprisingly, the widespread reaction on Mail Online yesterday was one of disbelief  and fury.

‘To discard a new, serviceable kitchen is an utter waste and is not likely to endear them to a hard-pressed public,’ wrote a reader from Worcestershire. ‘What they’ve forgotten — or are insensitive to — is that millions of their “subjects” still struggle to survive in Britain,’ said another.

Rose, from Maidstone, though, spoke for me: ‘Please, may I have the old kitchen?’ And perhaps most pertinent of all, from Jane in London: ‘The Queen would consider that extremely wasteful.’

Quite so. But the Queen is an octogenarian who holds dear the austere values of her time. Kate is both young and rich, and the truth is that we really should not be surprised that she loves to splash the cash.

There is another reason: few people in the public eye are as ‘on trend’ as is Kate, and few trends have established themselves as rapidly as that which has made today’s kitchen the most fashionable of contemporary status symbols.

Outstripping cars, pools, tennis courts and all the rest of the visibly extravagant paraphernalia available, the kitchen now is paramount.

Nothing demonstrates the stylish qualities of one’s ‘own taste’ quite as definitively as the area of the house where dirty pots and pans are made clean again.

Nobody worth their Maldon sea salt buys a new home and lives with — ugh — the ‘taste’ of the previous owner. Inevitably, no sooner has  the removal van left than the old units, fridge and manky hobs are quickly torn out and a skip arrives to carry them off.

Sometimes, the daftness beggars belief.

And in the case of Kate and William, their decision to replace a gorgeous £50,000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the  taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20-plus rooms at Kensington Palace which has quadrupled from its estimate to £4 million.

Even though the couple paid for most of the fixtures and fittings — as well they should, since William is a millionaire courtesy of his mother Diana’s inheritance — the bill for their son George’s nursery has been picked up by taxpayers.

The fripperies that, once, Kate seemed to eschew also seem to be mounting. A nice little trip to the five-star Cheval Blanc Resort in the Maldives? A £6,500-a-night rest-break, laid on for them during their three-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere? That’ll do nicely, they have apparently decided.

None, by themselves, appear too shocking. But added up? It’s not a good look.

Then, of course, there’s that second kitchen at her Kensington Palace apartment.

This trend for swanky kitchens, like so many others, is based on a strange inverted snobbery. Among the wealthy classes, the kitchen used to be the domain of servants; rarely, if ever, would the mistress of the house descend the stairs and absolutely never the master.

Yet now, even high up the social scale, people relish the chance to settle over a spag bol at the kitchen table. Famously, the so-called Chipping Norton set — ruled by David and Samantha Cameron, Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson and former newspaper editor Rebekah Brooks — regularly shared ‘kitchen suppers’.

Our kitchen obsession would be understandable if it were accompanied by an increase in people cooking good, wholesome meals from fresh, quality ingredients and making themselves and their families healthier in the process.

But it isn’t. While the British have an insatiable appetite for watching celebrity chefs offering countless recipes on TV, they then usually get out a frozen ready-meal.

For her part, the usually down-to-earth Duchess of Cambridge should concentrate on cooking up a  strategy to avoid being seen as Three Kitchens Kate.
