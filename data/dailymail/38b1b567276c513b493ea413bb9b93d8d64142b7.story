American tycoon Josh Harris' proposed takeover of Crystal Palace will enter its final stages this week, with a deal close to completion.

News broke of Harris' interest in the Selhurst Park club on Friday night, but Sportsmail understands negotiations between the businessman and current Eagles supremo Steve Parish are at now at an 'very advanced' stage.

Talk of Harris' arrival has been received with caution at the south London club, but Palace sources claim the deal, barring a dramatic collapse, could even be agreed by the end of the week.

A fee of £70million for the club has been suggested, though that figure is unconfirmed.

Sportsmail can reveal Harris, who also owns US sports teams Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, has visited Selhurst Park at least three times, with talks over the proposed takeover understood to have been ongoing for a month.

Harris has a long-standing interest in purchasing a Barclays Premier League club.

He is believed to have shown an interest in taking over at Aston Villa, West Bromwich and Everton in recent months but opted against pursuing deals at those clubs.

Palace's London location is said to be a key factor in Harris' decision to press ahead with an Eagles takeover.
