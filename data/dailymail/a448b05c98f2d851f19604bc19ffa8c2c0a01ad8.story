Male fish are becoming part female at unusually high rates in three Pennsylvania rivers, sparking concerns the water is tainted with chemicals.

Male smallmouth bass and white sucker fish carrying eggs in their testes were found in the Delaware, Ohio and Susquehanna rivers, according to research from the US Geological Survey.

Researchers have linked the increasing number of intersex fish, or fish with two genders, to a 'complex mix of chemicals' flowing into waterways from nearby farms.

'I did not expect
 to find it quite as widespread,' US Geological Survey 
biologist Vicki Blazer told Washington Post.

'(With the mutant bass) we keep
 seeing... a correlation with the percent of agriculture in the 
watershed where we conduct a study.'

Scientists have discovered intersex bass in several areas 
of the Potomac River, including near the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater
 Treatment Plant, since 2003.

Previous studies detected abnormal levels of chemicals such as herbicides, veterinary pharmaceuticals and manure from farms flowing into the nesting areas of the fish.

These chemicals disrupt the endocrine system, throwing off functions which regulate hormones and the reproductive system.

The Washington Post reported the problem extends beyond the Chesapeake Bay region, which includes Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia.

US Geological Survey scientists found intersex bass in the Columbia, Colorado and Mississippi river basins in 2009. However scientists have yet to identify a single chemical responsible for altering a fish's sexual characteristics.

A new Environmental Integrity Project report found there's a high incidence of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, and tighter monitoring of fertilizers and other chemicals used at farms is necessary.

'Farmers should more carefully manage these manure and chemical fertilizers, and reduce them in areas where excessive amounts are being applied,' the report said.

'Bay states will need better monitoring data in small sub-watersheds dominated by agriculture to accurately track pollution from farms.'

Last year, Democrats in the Maryland House and Senate sponsored a pair of bills requiring growers to submit records of their use of insecticides and herbicides to the state.

Researchers welcomed the proposal, saying it would help focus research on chemical 'hot spots'.

However the requirement was changed when growers said it would be a major financial burden. State lawmakers instead passed legislation to create a fund paying for mandatory pesticide reporting in the future.

Meanwhile Blazer said the presence of intersex fish 'is an indicator that something
 else is really wrong.'

'What are these things doing to the natural environment? If 
we find these things in wild organisms, there’s a good chance they’re 
also affecting people,' she told Washington Post.
