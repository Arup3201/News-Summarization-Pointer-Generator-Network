Projecting unity on Russia, President
 Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel put their differences over the U.S.'s spying program aside on Friday and threatened tougher and
 broader new sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't 
quickly change its disruptive behavior in Ukraine.

'We
 will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more-severe 
sanctions' if Russia disrupts a presidential election in Ukraine 
scheduled for May 25, Obama said at a news conference with Merkel 
outside the White House early Friday afternoon.

'Further sanctions will be unavoidable,' Merkel agreed.

Agree to disagree: President Barack Obama (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) put their differences of opinion over the U.S. spying program aside on Friday to display trans-Atlantic unity against an assertive Russia

This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade.

In October, Obama promised that the U.S. was no longer hacking her personal calls. That courtesy does not apply to other residents of Germany, including other German officials, however.

The issue has aggravated German citizens, prompting
 calls for Berlin to strike some type of agreement with Washington to 
limit U.S. surveillance on German soil.

Germany had hoped to get the U.S. to enter into a no-spy agreement with the country before today's meeting, but talks fell apart, The New York Times reports.

'What the Germans want, and wanted, is that we would never do anything 
against their laws on their territory,' a senior administration official told the Times. That's an agreement the U.S. 'has with no country.'

'There’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' President Obama said in February at a press conference with French President Francois Hollande when the subject of spying on that country's citizens came up.

President Obama said on Friday it 
wasn't accurate to say that the United States had proposed and 
then withdrawn a no-spy agreement.

Instead, he said the government has 
proposed the same guidelines with Germany that it maintains with other 
allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail.

At a press conference the two leaders made it clear 
they have differences when it comes to U.S. surveillance overseas.

'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,'  President Obama said.

Merkel was diplomatic, as well, but a shade more blunt: 'We have differences of opinion to overcome.'

A German parliamentary panel probing the NSA issue 
is eager to invite former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to speak to the 
panel. The German government has made clear it opposes the idea of 
letting Snowden, whose U.S. passport has been revoked, testify in 
Berlin, drawing criticism from Snowden's opponents.

This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade

The two leaders met as the European Union announced it would hold talks with Ukraine and Russia later this month on the price of natural gas, an attempt to avoid any disruption in supplies.

Moscow recently hiked the price of gas shipped to Ukraine to $485 per thousand cubic meters from $268.50, and threatened to limit deliveries if Kiev does not meet the new price and repay a debt of $3.5 billion.

More forebodingly, pro-Russia forces shot down two Ukrainian helicopters Friday and Ukraine reported many rebels dead and wounded as the interim government in Kiev launched its first major offensive against an insurgency that has seized government buildings across the east.

The diplomatic deal struck two weeks ago 
in Geneva has failed to de-escalate the conflict between pro-Russian 
separatists in eastern Ukraine and the central government in Kiev.

The 
U.S. and Europe have sharply rebuked Putin for flouting his 
responsibilities under the deal, and Moscow on Friday declared all hopes
 for implementing the accord 'effectively destroyed' after Kiev's offensive against the insurgents.

Obama said Putin is free to offer his own
 views with regard to events in Ukraine, but it isn't acceptable for the
 Kremlin to think 'it has veto power' over decisions made by a duly 
elected government in Kiev.

In their remarks, Obama and Merkel both said they would prefer the situation in Ukraine to be settled through diplomacy, but both leaders made it clear that 
the next step would be to order sanctions on separate parts of the 
Russian economy or military — on energy or arms for example — if Russia continued to ignore the agreement it made earlier this month with the U.S. and EU.

Neither leader specified precisely what was being considered.

As the crisis in Ukraine has worsened, Merkel has spoken to Putin perhaps more frequently than has any other European leader. Because of this, the U.S. sees her as a critical channel of communication, as well as a key player in the effort to prevent other EU nations from going soft on sanctions.

'There's no question that the situation in Ukraine, the continued failure by Russia to abide by its commitments in the Geneva Agreement will be a focus of the conversation,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said before the two leaders met.

U.S. and German officials said ahead of the Obama-Merkel meeting that part of the discussion probably would focus on how the U.S. and Europe would coordinate harsher punishments — including sanctions targeting broad sectors of Russia's economy — should Moscow further provoke tensions in Ukraine, such as by sending military forces into restive eastern Ukraine.

The White House is concerned that Europe's deep economic interests in Russia and dependence on Russian energy could deter EU nations from following through with sanctions that could ricochet onto their own economies.

'She's getting enormous pressure from German industry not to harm their interests,' said Heather Conley, a Europe expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "She has to start laying the political groundwork for this because it requires some sacrifice."

Merkel, like Obama, has ruled out military action to deter Putin from seizing more of Ukraine.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has urged Obama to send weapons to Ukraine's government, said he planned to tell Merkel during a private meeting that he was embarrassed but unsurprised by her country's failure of leadership.

'The leaders, they're being governed by the industrial complex of Germany,' McCain said Thursday. 'They might as well have them in the government. It's shameful.'

A troubled EU-U.S. trade agreement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, was also on the agenda, as well as joint efforts to deal with climate change, Syria's civil war and nuclear negotiations with Iran, said Laura Magnuson of the White House's National Security Council.

Merkel will also speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday, focusing on the fledgling trade agreement and U.S.-European economic ties.

President Obama says the U.S. government has proposed the same spying guidelines to Germany that it maintains with other allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail

'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,' President Obama said on Friday of the U.S. and Germany's positions on the U.S.'s spying program. Merkel was a shade more blunt: 'We have differences of opinion to overcome'
