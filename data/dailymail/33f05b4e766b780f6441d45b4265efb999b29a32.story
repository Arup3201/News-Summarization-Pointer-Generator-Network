A One Direction fan got more than she bargained for when she tried to get a selfie with Harry Styles... after falling over and landing in a giant pile of horse manure.

The girl joined a crowd of hundreds of 'Directioners' outside the London Coliseum on Monday, where Harry was presenting a British Fashion Award.

When the heart-throb emerged from a stage door, the crowd of girls surged toward their idol, who was quickly engulfed by adoring fans. 

A devoted One Direction fan fell to the ground as a crowd of girls surged towards their idol on Monday night

The position of her fall couldn't have been more unfortunate for the girl and she landed in a pile of horse dung

Undeterred, the determined fan picked herself up and continued running towards the One Direction star

But the rush was too much for one girl and she fell into a pile of dung which had been deposited outside the exclusive theatre by a passing police horse.

Undetered, the die-hard fan picked herself back up and got close to the One Direction star, asking him for a selfie.

Unfortunately for the fan, her devotion was not rewarded by Harry, who quickly jumped into an awaiting car.

An onlooker said: 'She wasn't drunk, I think it was the heels she was wearing. When everyone started running she just crashed down on the floor.

'I thought she had fallen quite badly but she got straight up and carried on running. I've never seen such determination.'

Harry had been rubbing shoulders with stars including Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner at the party, before awarding actress Emma Watson with the prestigious British Style Award.

Onlookers said she did not look drunk, but fell because she was trying to run too fast in her very high heels

The fan then managed to sidle up to the star, who declined her pleas for a selfie and got into his car
