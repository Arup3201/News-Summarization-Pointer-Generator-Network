Braving extreme temperatures as he pushes the limits of human endurance, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has few opportunities to worry about his appearance.

But even famous explorers, it seems, want to look their best.

In recent months the celebrated mountaineer appears to have acquired a toupee, concealing his receding hairline.

south-west London

As these pictures show, three years ago, the former SAS officer was distinctly thinning on top.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Festival in October 2009 - the year he became the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest - Sir Ranulph had no more than a few strands to keep him warm. 

He achieved all this despite having a heart condition, a fear of heights, 
and a few missing fingertips after frostbite attacked his fingers so 
badly he performed a DIY amputation in his garden shed.

But it appears that feat was not enough to turn back time, and on Monday, at the announcement of his latest challenge, the sprightly 68-year old sported a full thatch of grey-brown hair.

His thickened locks will do little to 
keep him warm as he leads the first team on foot across the Antarctic 
during the southern winter.

Lustrous locks: The explorer unveils his route for the 'Coldest Journey on Earth' with his hair looking somewhat thicker than before

Brave: Sir Ranulph speaks during a press conference at the Royal Society in London on Monday, where he announced his latest challenge

Those on the expedition, billed as the
Coldest Journey On Earth, are expected to face temperatures as low as 
-90C in some places.

The team will carry out readings and measurements for scientists, providing data on marine life, oceanography and meteorology.

Sir Ranulph was described by Guinness 
World Records in 1984 as ‘the world’s greatest living explorer’.

He said he thought of his wife, children and a 'hot bath' during arduous challenges.

He is 
hoping to raise $10million (£6.17million) for Seeing Is 
Believing, a charitable initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around 
the world.

'There is a huge, blank knowledge of the winter of Antarctica, what is happening to Antarctica during a period when the scientists can't normally get out there,' Sir Ranulph told BBC Breakfast this week.

Bravery: Sir Ranulph was the first person to cross the Anarctic on foot and in 2009 he became the oldest Briton to climb Mount Everest - despite having a heart condition and a fear of heights

'Our caboose will be bristling with scientific instruments, for Nasa, for the European Space Agency.'

No doubt the bristles will also include those on a hairbrush, after the adventurer apparently decided to recapture his youth with a new head of hair.

Sir Ranulph is famous for taking part in the first successful circumnavigation via both poles with Charles Burton in 1982.

He also achieved a world first in 1992-1993 by completing the first crossing of the Antarctic Continent on foot with Mike Stroud, in what was the longest unsupported polar journey in history.

A ship will drop the team off on the Pacific coast of the continent, where they will set off over the ice shelf when the equinox arrives on 21 March 2013.

Sir Ranulph will then ascend 10,000ft (3,000m) on to the inland plateau, and head onwards to the South Pole. It will be hundreds of miles before the team drops 11,000ft back on to the ice shelf.

After covering around 2,000 miles (3,200km) in total their journey will end at the Ross Sea.

While Sir Ranulph and a skiing partner will lead on foot, the BBC revealed they will be followed by two bulldozers dragging industrial sledges.

Inside three containers on the sledges will be the team's living quarters, supplies, and a science laboratory. Dragged behind this will be the fuel they need.

Making it alive across one of the most inhospitable terrains in the world will be a challenge.

On the same ice shelf 100 years ago, Capt Scott died after he was caught out by the start of the southern winter.

Over 40 years the former SAS officer has carved a career as one of the world’s top explorers.

He undertook several expeditions to the North Pole in the 1990s while striving to become the first person to reach it solo and unaided.

In 2003 he ran seven marathons in seven days, just four months after his heart attack. And in 2007 he climbed the North Face of the Eiger, one of the hardest challenges in the Alps.
