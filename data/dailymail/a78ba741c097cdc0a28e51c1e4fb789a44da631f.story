Seven years before he allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in Sydney's Martin Place, Omarjan Azari was fanatical about soccer.

The 22-year-old, whose parents left for Saudi Arabia the day before he was arrested and are not yet unaware of their son's arrest, was so good at soccer he was selected for a representative side in Sydney.

But Omarjan, who was a student at Parramatta High School, didn't take it up.

Omarjan was arrested on Thursday in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation as hundreds of police raided homes in Sydney and Brisbane.

'Afghanis are traditionally more interested in study than sport,' the accused's cousin Rami Azari told Daily Mail Australia.

'There was another Greek kid who wasn't as good but Omarjan knew he wanted it desperately and so Omarjan gave up his place.

'He was always interested in justice and fighting against injustice.

'Maybe [that's what got him into trouble].' 

Omarjan appeared in court on Thursday charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He is the second man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in the raids.

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.

The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'.

'I don't believe that he made the phone call [making the beheading threat],' Omarjan's cousin said.

'He'd stopped using his phone because he was being followed by police and ASIO.'

Omarjan's uncle, University of Western Sydney lecturer in Afghani studies, Dr Ehsan Azari, said his nephew was 'very pious'. 

'But if he is truly involved in this it is someone else who has convinced him, turned his mind,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was not a scholar, or very good at school.'

Dr Azari is a respected Sydney academic, specialising in English literature, and a media commentator on politics in the Afghani and Pakistani region.

He has an MA in English literature and linguistics, and a PhD in critical and cultural studies.

He regrets what has happened in his homeland since he emigrated to Australia 20 years ago.

'We came from war and now there is all this talk of war,' he said.

Dr Azari has written books on literature, drama and poetry, in particular Shakespeare, and a book on Sufism, the mystical Islamic faith.

He said it was sad Afghani people, who had long historical ties with Australia, might be regarded as suspicious by some Australians.

Dr Azari said Omarjan's parents haven't been told of their son's arrest.

'We cannot tell his father because he is very sick and might die,' he said.

Omarjan's father, Alim Azari, who is a severe diabetic, and his wife flew out from Sydney airport on Wednesday for the Middle East to celebrate the Hajj festival.

The couple were planning to spend 20 days in Saudi Arabia.

The Azaris, who are believed to have four children, had moved just three weeks ago from Guildford to the rented house in South Wentworthville - both in Sydney's west - where Omarjan was arrested in Thursday's raids. 

His sister and a man are still living in the house.

It's a quiet suburban street where devout Muslim and mechanic apprentice Omarjan plotted allegedly to commit a public beheading just days after his parents were out of the country, and which narrowly missed being the epicentre of Thursday's terrorism raids.

Only one neighbour noticed a sign of the intense police surveillance on the brick duplex where Azari allegedly spent three months conspiring the terrorist attack, before his family was forced to move to the house in Guildford where he was arrested.

A local business owner noticed the police vehicle always on the corner around from the Azari's home until it disappeared four weeks ago.

Omarjan lived with his father Alam, mother Gulpekai, brother, Fahim and sister, Mursal in number 4A, the front half of a brick duplex in a dilapidated cul de sac in Sydney's west.

A New Zealand family lived behind them in 4B.

The house is just over two kilometres from the western Sydney business district of Parramatta and about an hour's drive from Martin Place, where police allege Omarjan Azari was going to behead a random member of the public after his parents had flown out to Saudi Arabia.

It seems the Azaris were the only Muslims in the street where Sri Lankan and Indian families live in houses below the western rail line.

The Azari's house, which has marble tiled floors and a garden flourishing with lavender, is one of the better looking homes in the street.

But the family was given notice to move out by early September, because the house and the one next door are due to be demolished to make way for a block of flats.

Omarjan's uncle Ehsan Azari said the forced move to Guildford had caused some anxiety for his sister and brother-in-law, coming so soon before they were due to leave on their three-week holiday for the Hajj religious festival in Saudi Arabia.

Neighbours of the Azari's told Daily Mail Australia the family had been quiet, kept to themselves except to say hello and that on weekends Omarjan used to roam around the street and play cricket with young men who looked to be in their late teens.

But since the second week of May, Omarjan Azari and the street had been under police surveillance, which had to switch six kilometres away to Bursill St, Guildford when the family moved.

Rami Azari said his cousin was a 'gentle loving person' and the allegations didn't make sense.

Omarjan had worked as a sales assistant, done some accountancy which he didn't like, then done a mechanical apprenticeship at TAFE and had recently gained a full apprenticeship as a car mechanic. 

Rami said his cousin 'didn't have time' to be involved in any terror plots because 'he studies at night'.

Dr Ehsan Azari is a lecturer in Afghani studies at University of Western Sydney

He said Omarjan - who police are believed to have kept under surveillance since May this year - had been aware he was being followed.

'He's only a kid. He was petrified. He's been scared for a long time,' Rami said.

'He's been scared for a long time because he was being followed.'

Rami said when they talked, Omarjan would insist they put their mobile phones in the car, so they could ensure no one was listening.

For that reason, he could not believe police had any evidence of a phone call.

Rami said after his cousin gave up his spot in the soccer team for the other player, the Greek Australian had gone on to play professional soccer over in Greece.

Both Rami and his father said although Omarjan was very religious he was 'too young' to have done what he was accused of.

The Azaris said although police said Omarjan was 22-years-old, he was actually only 20.
