Thierry Henry has abandoned plans to build a giant fish tank in a house he wants knock down and re-develop because it doesn't suit the needs of his family.

The ex-Arsenal striker was given the green light to demolish his £6million mansion in Hampstead, North London, and build another but there was a last minute change to the application.

Documents submitted to Camden Council a day before it was due to go before a planning committee are pretty much the same but with an omission - the three-storey aquarium.

Footballer Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbours but now the plan for an aquarium (bottom left) will not go ahead

The original plans showed a 40ft high fish tank stretching 15ft across and going from from the basement up to the roof of the second floor.

The four separate tanks on top of one another would have been worth around £250,000 and would have held 5,500 gallons of water.

It would have housed 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen Ireland look like tiddlers.

One local, who asked not to be named, said: 'Thierry obviously had his heart set on the aquarium.

'But in the end everyone around here was saying he was only demolishing the old house so he could get the fish tank specially made to his liking.

'Knocking down a perfectly good 13-year-old house worth in the region of £10m is not something that is looked upon kindly if it is just to put a fish tank in, so a lot of us think he got round the council simply by saying he would get rid of the aquarium.'

Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else?'

Actor Tom Conti, who is a neighbour of Henry's in Hampstead, north London, led an attack against the plans, but the councillors gave their consent for the building to be knocked down and re-built.

Henry - Arsenal’s record goalscorer who now plays for the New York Red Bulls - did not attend the meeting.

Camden councillor Jonathan Simpson described the designs as ‘fantastic’, adding: ‘It is an outstanding contribution to the borough.’

Conti, the 70-year-old actor best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area.

Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home.

Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition

‘Its interior spaces are cramped, deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu Evans, the agents acting on his behalf.

The row in leafy Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry applied for planning permission.

 The French footballer – who fronted the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks.

Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks.

Ireland has reportedly spent more than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor.

It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish.

One tank designer, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are looking for status symbols and showpieces.’

Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007.

But he is understood to be keen to maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His new home will also include a swimming pool and gym.

Henry’s new home is expected to take about six months to complete.

Before news of the successful planning application Mr Conti said: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months.

'There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’

Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months.

Trading is only permitted under strict Government regulations.

The house’s original architect, Sir Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects, opposed Henry’s application.

He said the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’.

Influential civic group the Heath and Hampstead Society had also called for the application to be thrown out, saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.
