Police are unable to ‘completely eliminate’ the possibility that Boris Berezovsky was murdered, it emerged yesterday.

Officers said they found the exiled Russian oligarch lying on a bathroom floor with a ‘ligature’ around his neck and similar material tied to a shower rail above him.

But although there was no evidence of a struggle they said the possibility someone else was involved in his death remained.

The discovery of the body of the 67-year-old billionaire at a £20million Berkshire mansion has sparked an explosion of speculation around his death.

Inquest: The hearing is being held at the Windsor Guildhall where Prince Charles was married

At the opening of an inquest, Detective Inspector Mark Bissell said specialist officers were still checking the large Ascot property for clues.

He said the involvement of a third party ‘cannot be completely eliminated as tests remain outstanding’.

Mr Berezovsky was referred to as Platon Elemin at the hearing in Windsor. He changed his name by deed poll after fleeing to Britain in 2000 and becoming a vocal critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Mr Bissell added that Mr Berezovsky was last seen alive at approximately 9.05pm the night before by the same employee, believed to be a bodyguard.

The scene of the death is currently under police control and the results of any tests carried out will take several weeks, Mr Bissell said.

The inquest at the Guildhall in 
Windsor, where the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall, was 
adjourned to a future date by the coroner.

Coroner's officer Janine Prunty 
confirmed that Berezovsky's daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya had formally
 identified the body of her father

Officers said they are speaking to 
the Russian's close friends and family to build up a picture of his 
state of mind in the last days of his life.

It is thought that he was having 
serious financial difficulties after paying out astronomical sums in 
legal fees over the last few years, and wanted to return to Russia. 

Broken: Boris Berezovsky sued former business partner Roman Abramovich for billions of pounds but lost, which those close to him claimed 'destroyed' him

Boris Berezovsky with his ex girlfriend Elena and two children Arina (eight) and Gleb (six). The exiled 67-year-old tycoon was found by his bodyguard at his estate in Ascot on Saturday

The oligarch, who last year lost a 
multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea owner Roman 
Abramovich, could have run up £100million in legal bills since 2011.

In July 2011, he paid out Britain's 
biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. 
Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100million.

He later built up fees totalling more
 than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with
 his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout 
much of his battle with Mr Abramovich.

Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 
2000 after falling out with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has 
survived a number of assassination attempts.

Police investigating the death of Mr Berezovsky (pictured here in 2003), one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponents, said there is so far no evidence to suggest any third party involvement in his death

Mansion: Police descend on oligarch's multi-million pound home after his body was found

His body was discovered on the 
bathroom floor of a £20million mansion in Acot on Saturday after a 
bodyguard became concerned and smashed the door open.

Experts in chemical, biological and 
nuclear emergencies spent hours combing the house amid fears that 
Mr Berezovsky could have been poisoned by the Kremlin, but no radiation 
was found.

Another report claimed that detectives investigating the death did not find a suicide note.

Some friends continue to insist Mr 
Berezovsky was the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against Putin’s regime. Others believe he killed himself after 
becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth and status.

The exiled 67-year-old tycoon nicknamed the 'godfather of the Kremlin', is reported to have been found by his bodyguard at his mansion

The mansion in Ascot where he was found is understood to be owned by his former wife Ms Besharova, 54.

Her close friend told the 
Mail: ‘Galina is very upset about Boris’s death, as are their children. 
She remained close to Boris after they split up and it was at her house 
that he died.

‘She really does not want to talk 
about how he died. But there are many ways to induce what may appear to 
be a natural death like a heart attack.’

Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford adjourned the hearing.
