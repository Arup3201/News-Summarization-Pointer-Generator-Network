A pet beagle has been taped together with a Velcro-style material after she was almost ripped in two during an vicious dog attack.

Five-year-old Bonnie was torn open from her belly to the top of her back after an American bulldog gnawed its teeth into her skin in one fierce bite.

Bonnie's gaping wound was stitched up immediately by a local vet near to her home in Bathgate, West Lothian.

Bonnie, a five-year-old beagle, right, was almost torn in two after an American bulldog sunk its teeth into her body during a random one-bite attack in Bathgate, West Lothian earlier this month

But the wound reopened and could not be stitched back up because most of the skin had shed off.

Now the dog has undergone revolutionary treatment at the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh - known as the Dick Vet - to have her wound stuck together with the Velcro-style type.

Her owner, Valerie Millen, says the treatment she is receiving is the first of its kind in the UK. The tape is only used on animals, not on humans.

The 46-year-old said: 'Bonnie is still in the care of the 
Dick Vet in Edinburgh. She is getting the treatment and will be the 
first in the UK to get it.

'They use it in America but it’s never been done here.'

Bonnie sustained her horrific injury after Ms Millen took her for a walk five minutes from their home.

As they were walking, an American bulldog ran up to Bonnie and took one giant chunk out of her skin, before running off.

Police Scotland say a woman has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act following the incident. She has been released on bail.

Ms Millen said: 'I’m just shocked, devastated.

'Since she has been at the Dick Vet we don’t get to see her but we get a call everyday about how she is. I just want her home. She is part of the family.'

Ms Millen said the fabric fastener - which uses microscopic hooks and loops - has been glued to Bonnie’s skin on both sides of the wound.

The stretching technique should allow vets eventually to stitch the wound up.

Despite having insurance, the family face a £9,000 bill for the treatment at the school.

A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'A woman has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act after the dog she
 was in charge of attacked another woman and a beagle on Alexandra 
Drive, Boghall, on July 10.

'A
 report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal. Police have been liaising
 with West Lothian Council and restrictions have been placed on the 
animal.'

A spokesman for West Lothian Council said: 'We are assisting Police Scotland with its enquiries into this matter.

'In these circumstances it is not appropriate for us to comment. We would encourage anyone with information to contact Police Scotland on 101.'
