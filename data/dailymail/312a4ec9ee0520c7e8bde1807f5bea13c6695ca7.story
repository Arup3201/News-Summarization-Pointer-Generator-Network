A miracle baby was born after doctors glued him into his mother's womb – ending her 15-year struggle to have a child.

Emma Ryley, 43, from Milton Keynes and her husband Paul, 42, had been trying to start a family since 1999, five years after they got married.

The birth of their first baby, Ethan, is an early success for a new technique using embryo glue which works by increasing the embryo's ability to stick to the side of the womb.

Baby Ethan Ryley was born weighing 5Ib 15 after his parents tried new fertility technique using embryo glue

The embryo is dipped into the gluey substance prior to being put back into the womb during IVF treatment.

Mrs Ryley, who is head of estates for a building company, said: 'It was the most emotional moment when I finally held Ethan in my arms, and I knew I was a mum at last.

'We'd had so many years of heartbreak, but now we finally had our miracle baby - and it was all thanks to a tub of glue.

'It seemed a strange concept for him to be glued into my womb, but it certainly worked.'

His mother Emma Ryley said: 'It was the most emotional moment when I finally held Ethan in my arms, and I knew I was a mum at last'

'We had started trying for a baby but nothing had happened after several years of trying.

'We were referred to hospital and had numerous tests, but the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with either of us, so we just had to keep trying.'

She was put on a fertility drug to boost egg product but that didn't work. They kept trying but she never fell pregnant.

She said: 'We tried for years and years, and had even more tests, but nothing ever came back that anything was wrong. I thought I was destined never to become a mum. It was heartbreaking. As the years went by, my dream of motherhood just seemed to get further and further away.

'We had started to discuss adoption as we thought it was the only way that we would become parents.'

Ethan was born at Milton Keynes Hospital a week after his mother bleeding heavily at 36 weeks

In December 2012 the couple decided to try IVF treatment and three months later they had an appointment at CARE Fertility in Milton Keynes.

They started their course of IVF treatment. Mrs Ryley's eggs were collected and harvested with her husband's sperm.

After the treatment they had three viable embryos and one was put back into her womb.

But before the transfer, doctors at CARE Fertility suggested using the new glue to give the embryos a better chance of sticking to the womb,

Mrs Ryley said: 'We had never heard of anything like this before, but we were willing to give anything a try. We had been trying for a baby for 15 years and I'd never fallen pregnant before in all that time.

'We knew that time was running out for us, so we wanted to give it everything we could. When doctors told us they could use this new glue to literally glue our baby into my womb, we agreed to try it.

'It was a surprising and unusual concept, but it seemed simple enough.'

She started bleeding at 36 weeks and was rushed into hospital. 

Baby Ethan was born a week later in March, weighing a healthy 5Ib15, at Milton Keynes Hospital. 

Research has shown that using the glue has increased the live birth rate by eight percent.

A spokeswoman for CARE Fertility, which treated Mrs Ryley, said: 'This is a new form of treatment that we have been using for about 18 months and it has shown promising results.' 

Embryo Glue is a viscous (thick) solution containing high concentrations of an adherence (sticky) compound called Hyaluronan. 

Adherence of the embryo to the lining inside the womb will aid implantation. Hyaluronan is naturally present in the fluid in both the ovaries and the womb, and the level is known to rise in the womb at the time of embryo implantation.

The exact mechanism by which Hyaluronan promotes implantation has not yet been identified, however scientists believe that it assists implantation by:

Embryo Glue can be used for the transfer of cleavage stage embryos and blastocysts in both fresh and frozen cycles and can therefore benefit any patient undergoing IVF treatment. 

Studies have demonstrated that Embryo Glue is particularly beneficial for patients who are over 35 years old, patients with a history of failed implantation and for patients with unexplained infertility.
