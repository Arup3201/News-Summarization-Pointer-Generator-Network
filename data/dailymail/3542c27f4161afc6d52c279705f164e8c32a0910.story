It may be the happiest place on Earth, but the Magic Kingdom has become a little more restrictive for some children hoping to enjoy Disney's U.S. parks on their own.

Beginning on March 23, anyone under the age of 14 must be accompanied by someone 14 years of age or older.

Enforcement of the rule at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland in Anaheim, California, will be enforced solely by a park worker's own judgment on age.

Should children under the age of 14 be allowed to enter Disney parks alone?

Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown told NBC News: 'If a cast member who is working at the front gates sees a guest who appears to be younger than 14 without someone who appears to be older than that, they will engage in a conversation with the guest.'

She added that if an employee determines that the child is under 14, their parents will be contacted to pick them up.

Prior to the announcement, Disney did not have any age restrictions for guests arriving solo.

The new rule was established after Disney conducted a survey of its guests and contacted various child welfare associations, according to NBC News.

Input from both led to the age requirement.

Ms Brown also noted that 14 is the minimum age for babysitters, as recommended by the American Red Cross.

News of the age restriction comes nearly a week after a child on vacation with his father and step-mother drowned in a pool at Disney's Pop Century Resort, which is on the grounds of the Orlando theme park.

Anthony Johnson, of Springfield, Missouri, was swimming in the hotel pool with a group of children including his little brother, Christopher, and a cousin at about 9:30pm when the incident occurred.  

Witnesses said the teen was playing in the water on Sunday evening with family members.

A cousin spotted him underwater around 9.10pm and alerted others in the group who pulled him out to the side of the pool.

Orange County Sheriff's officials said Anthony had a pulse and was breathing when he was taken to nearby Celebration Hospital, but he died several days later.
