Luther Burrell breaks out into a broad grin when asked if he’d relish the prospect of playing alongside Manu Tuilagi in England’s midfield.

‘One hundred per cent,’ he replies unerringly.

‘If a defensive team was to come up against that, it would be quite daunting. He’s a freak isn’t he? To play alongside him would be awesome.’

The Burrell and Tuilagi pairing was a heavyweight combination, in every sense, that Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team were seriously considering in the lead-up to the autumn before one snapped a bone in his hand playing for Northampton and the other injured his groin.

Without their most muscular midfield pairing — which would tip the scales at a combined weight of 220 kilos or 34st 6lbs in old money — England were again forced to settle for a hotch-potch of combinations. They finished the series no closer to knowing their preferred midfield pairing than when they began.

Burrell knows a run of performances between now and the end of January would put him at the front of the queue to face Wales in Cardiff on February 6.

A relative lightweight in comparison to Tuilagi at a mere 108 kg, the Huddersfield-born star is fit and raring to go again following a frustrating few weeks. He starts on Saturday at inside centre for Saints against bitter east Midlands rivals Leicester at Franklin’s Gardens.

And Burrell has said he hopes to line up next to Manu Tuilagi (pictured) for England in the near future

‘I’m feeling fresh after a spell on the bench on the weekend,’ he said. ‘But this is the fixture that you look out for. It’s the one you look forward to at the start of the season.

‘The reason I joined this club was to be involved in this sort of thing. It’s as close to an international game as you’re going to get.

‘It was a six-week injury but I was back within three weeks which was positive. I’m back on the mend and looking forward to a big performance.’

Sadly for the sell-out crowd, Leicester’s Tuilagi remains sidelined, although his return is thought to be imminent. But even without the powerhouse Samoan-born centre there is no question of Saturday's encounter fitting into anything other than the blood-and-thunder category.

England flanker Tom Croft and hooker Tom Youngs return to bolster a rejuvenated Leicester pack that also includes Geoff Parling and Dan Cole. The Tigers’ horrendous injury jinx appears to have finally abated.

For Burrell, the need to put a consistent run of performances together to remind England’s management why they made him an ever-present in their midfield alongside Brad Barritt during last year’s Six Nations is paramount.

At just 91kg (14st 4lbs), Burrell’s opposite man Anthony Allen will concede more than two stone in weight on Saturday. His relative lack of bulk is the prime reason the 28-year-old Tiger has failed to add to the two caps he won eight years ago under Andy Robinson. Last Friday night, Bath fielded a back line containing rugby league convert Sam Burgess (18st 4lbs) at 12 and Matt Banahan (17st 7lbs) on the wing.

Like it or not, it’s the reality of modern rugby, and Burrell is up for the challenge.

‘The game has really moved on now and you have got some brilliant athletes now,’ he said. ‘People are getting stronger, bigger, faster. The competition is healthy. I need to stick in the gym and keep working on that because the last thing I want to do is fall behind them.’

But the 27-year-old, who wears No 12 for Saints on Saturday but has shown he’s just as comfortable at 13, is eager is point out that size isn’t everything when it comes to his own game.

Burrell has said World Cup rival Sam Burgess is 'more suited to the back row'

‘I think initially I was pigeon-holed as a basher,’ he said. ‘Actually there’s more subtlety to my game. I can kick on the front foot, I can pass a ball on both sides. People are starting to pick up on that. I do have a point-of- difference and I have to use that. Size, getting over the gain line. But when the composure is needed in terms of getting to the line and throwing the right pass at the right time … it’s something I really have worked on.

‘It’s something the England bosses are picking up on.’

Of all his World Cup rivals, Burgess is dominating the column inches. ‘I think he’s more suited to the back row,’ Burrell says with a smile.

But whoever he’s paired with, and wherever he’s picked, Burrell insists he just wants to play. ‘If they picked me at hooker I’d say “yes”. All I can do is play well for Saints. This is a pretty good stage to start.’

Take a bow Luther. It’s play time.
