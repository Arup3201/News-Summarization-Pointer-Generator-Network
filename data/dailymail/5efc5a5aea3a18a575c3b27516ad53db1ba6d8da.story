Gareth Southgate will not search for stars if England reach Euro 2015 as he vowed to stick with the players who are on the brink of qualification.

England, who have already won Group One, face fixtures tonight in Lithuania and Moldova next Tuesday before they discover in seven days which country they must beat over two legs in October to secure a trip to the Czech Republic.

But if they fulfil that aim, Southgate has made it clear he will not look to draft in players such Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling to boost England’s chances, even though they are all eligible.  

Warning: Gareth Southgate has told young England hopefuls they must show commitment to his project

(4-2-3-1): Butland: Gibson, Moore, M Keane, Robinson: Ward-Prowse, Chalobah: Redmond, Kane, Ince: Berahino.

Former Under-21 head coach Stuart Pearce used to clash with the FA over not being able to select the best available players and often used the example of Spain, who picked World Cup winners Juan Mata and Javi Martinez when they won the 2011 tournament in Denmark.

Southgate, however, does not feel there would be any benefits – either for the players or his team – by naming those who have graduated. Sterling, for instance, played in three of Southgate’s first five games but is now one of the first names on Roy Hodgson’s team sheet.

I can tell you now that isn't even in my thinking,’ said Southgate. ‘Alex, for example, has been to two major championships. Those guys are seniors. I know people cite Spain, with Mata and a couple of others. But this is fairly typical of must Under 21 coaches around Europe.

‘Christian Eriksen still qualifies to play for Denmark but I don't see the Danes clamouring for him (to be involved with the Under 21s). It is that balance. You need to see what can be gained by bringing them back into this environment.

‘My job is like that of a reserve team manager at a club - you have got to adapt and adjust to the players you have got available. Roy wants to play younger players, so they are going to gain international experience. That is key.’

The standard of opposition England face over the next five days, starting here in Kaunas, will have no relation to what will be in store next month but Southgate is not concerned they will be found wanting after their educational trip to Toulon this summer.

‘We went there so the players could recognise the level that is needed and the experiences they are going to face,’ said Southgate. ‘Very few of the countries (who will be in the play-offs) are going to face a really top side prepare them for next month.

There are going to be seven or eight top nations in the draw but you don’t know who will be strong. For all we know, Poland could be stronger than Spain. It is difficult to tell with age groups but I don't think we are short of talent.’
