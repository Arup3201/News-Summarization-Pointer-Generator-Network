Marlins third baseman Greg Dobbs has been to the hospital to visit the 12-year-old boy who was hit in the face by a line drive during a game between Florida and the New York Mets.

Dobbs says he went to Elmhurst Hospital on Tuesday and spent a little more than an hour with the boy and his family.

He says the boy is doing OK after he was struck square in the face by Dobbs' foul liner Monday in the opening game of a doubleheader at Citi Field.

Apology: Dobbs, whose line-drive smashed the boy in the face, visited him in hospital

Ouch! A young boy who took a line drive to the face at yesterday afternoon's Mets-Marlins game was taken to a local hospital for treatment

Dobbs says the boy has a broken nose, a fractured sinus and a 
concussion.

But he says the boy was expected to be released from the 
hospital Tuesday night and doctors do not anticipate any permanent 
damage.

The boy was struck when Florida's 
Greg Dobbs hit a ninth-inning liner into the right-field seats, just 
beyond the New York dugout.

Stadium
medical workers immediately tended to the boy, who was bleeding 
heavily. Accompanied by his mother, he was carted away in a wheelchair 
after the game and taken under the stands to an ambulance.

Following the final out of New 
York's 2-1 victory, Mets second baseman Justin Turner went over to wait 
for the boy by the railing. Turner took off his jersey and handed it 
over as a souvenir. New York manager Terry Collins also came over, and 
Dobbs gave the boy a bat.

Nathan Wise, 18, and his brother 
Daniel, 14, from New Rochelle were sitting near the boy, who was in the 
front row of section 119 for the first game of a single-admission 
doubleheader.

'His mom stood up and was 
screaming for a medic. A guy came running over and took off his shirt 
and put it on the kid's head,' Daniel Wise said.

It was unclear how old the boy 
was. Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said the team could not provide any 
information because of medical privacy laws.

'We saw him hit a line drive and, 
at first, we thought we might catch it. But it went past us and we saw 
it hit the kid,' Nathan Wise said.

'We saw him put his hands out and try
to block it, but he's a little kid, so his reactions were slow. We saw 
his hands up and then saw blood trickling down his face.

'A security 
guard called over to the Mets' dugout for some towels. It looked really 
serious, but after a couple of minutes, we saw the medics standing 
around and we realized it was bad, but it wasn't life-threatening.'

Between games, the seat bottom was
removed with drills, and a crew of at least four other maintenance 
workers were washing the area to clean up the blood.

The boy's condition was not immediately available.

Dobbs told the New York Daily News
after the game: 'They say he doesn't have a broken nose. They say he 
has a laceration, a really deep laceration on his nose.

Guilty: Dobbs said the boy did not have a broken nose, nor did he lose his eyesight, but he did suffer a deep laceration

'His orbitals are fine - the bones
around the eye. His sight's fine... thank God. I just want to call the 
mom and tell her that I'm praying for her son, and hope he's ... okay 
and on the mend and out of the hospital.'

It was the latest injury to a fan at a major league ballpark this season.

In a bizarre coincidence, a woman 
was struck in the face by a baseball at the New York Yankees-Baltimore Orioles game at Orioles Park yesterday.

In March, a San Francisco Giants fan was 
severely beaten outside Dodger Stadium, causing serious 
injuries. A man died when he fell from a stairway during a May 24 
Colorado Rockies game. And a Texas firefighter tumbled over an outfield 
railing to his death July 7 while catching a ball tossed to him at a 
Rangers game.
