Fifty Shades of Grey producers are set to make two versions of the film so they can please both fans of the explicit book and allow the movie to be shown in mainstream cinemas.

'What we’re kind of hearing from the 
fans is they want it dirty... they want it as close as possible [to the 
book],' said producer Dana Brunetti, who has been listening to the demands of the book's female followers on Twitter.

After a fairly restrained take on the bondage bestseller for mainstream cinema audiences, he reveals filmmakers are planning to release a more explicit version soon afterwards.

The sex scenes featuring bondage, 
spanking and sadomasochism were a big part of the appeal of the so-called 'mommy porn' books by
 EL James.

They tell the story of virginal college student Anastasia Steele, who embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery with her S&M-loving boss, billionaire entrepreneur Christian
 Grey

But they have created a minefield for filmmakers of the £25m movie who risk either neglecting the racy book's fans by toning it down too much or getting a rating that deems it off limits for mainstream cinemas.

If the first version of the film gets an
 R or restricted rating in America it could be seen by anyone aged 17 or
 over. A more explicit version may get the much rarer NC-17 certificate, 
which is reserved for films depicting rape or drug use.

'I always thought it would be really 
cool if we released the R version [18 in Britain] and then we had an NC-17 version that 
we released a few weeks later.

'Everybody could go and enjoy the R 
version, and then if they really wanted to see it again and get a little
 bit more gritty with it then have that NC-17 version out there as 
well. That is my idea, but the fans and the studio [Universal 
Pictures] will benefit from the double dip...

'We
 do not want this film to be seen as mommy porn - we want to keep it 
elevated but also give the fans what they want,' Brunetti told review site collider.com.

If the clever marketing strategy was followed in Britain the film could seek an 18 certificate for the more vanilla version and an R18 rating for the explicit cut, meaning it could be shown only in cinemas with a special license cinemas, revealed the Sunday Times.

But cinemas could legally change themselves into sex-film venues for 'special events' such as midnight screenings, as long as they get local authority approval, said a former adviser to the British Board of Film Classification.

The film's scheduled release was delayed after British actor Charlie Hunnam, 33, pulled out of the lead role. He has been replaced by Belfast-born former model Jamie Dornan, 31, who portrayed a serial killer in the BBC series The Fall. Dakota Johnson, 24, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, plays the role of Anastasia Steele.

The
 highly-anticipated movie, which starts shooting in Vancouver tomorrow, was scheduled to premiere in August next year. However fans will have to wait a little while longer.

The first part of the trilogy is now set to hit the big screen until February 13 2015, suggesting Universal hopes it will be a Valentine's date movie.
