Queens Park Rangers will see the benefits of five years work when the Barclays Premier League make it’s first foray into the Indian market later this month.

The Premier League will host their second international fan park event in Mumbai between December 13-14, which, among other events, will see coaches from England’s top-flight clubs head to India to hold clinics.

However, QPR will be represented by their own Mumbai-based coaches at the two day event, which takes place at Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Grounds.

QPR have developed their own coaches to work with Indian youngsters in Mumbai (L-R) Jesse Foyle (Education Manager), Fardin Shaikh, Gulafsha Ansari, Sheetal Hedulkar, Kumar Rathod, Martino Chevannes (Community Trust Manager)

Rangers – through the work of their charitable arm QPR in the Community Trust and their academy set-up – have been working in India’s most populous city for five years, through their the Mumbai Soccer Challenger initiative, which serves as a talent hunt for local youngsters at coaching clinics conducted by QPR coaches.

And those coaches will lead QPR’s presence during the event, which will be attended by Premier League legends Peter Schmeichel and Robbie Fowler.

Sheetal Hedulkar (28), Kumar Rathod (21), Gulafsha Ansari (18) and Fardin Shaikh (21) will join dozens of UK-based coaches from other Premier League clubs in delivering workshops.

QPR’s vice chairman, Amit Bhatia, who was born in London and educated in Delhi, said: ‘We are the pioneers in breaking new ground in India and it gives me a great sense of pride when I see the impact QPR’s work is having in Mumbai, in particular.

‘Prior to our involvement in the Mumbai Soccer Challenger, children from municipal schools rarely got a platform to compete in tournaments thereby depriving them an opportunity to showcase their skills.’
