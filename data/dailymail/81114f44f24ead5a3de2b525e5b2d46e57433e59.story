More than 1,000 women suffered a sexual assault every day last year - but only one in 88 rape claims resulted in a conviction, a report said yesterday.

One in five women has been a victim of sexual assault since the age of 16, with almost half a million adult females in England and Wales preyed upon every year, the study revealed.

While most of the 400,000 female victims were subject to unwanted touching and indecent exposure, one in every 200 women was a victim of rape or another serious sexual assault.

There are a total of 473,000 victims 
of sex offences every year, for which 60,000 to 95,000 are victims of 
rape, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.

It was estimated that there were 
97,000 victims of the most serious sexual offences last year. The 
analysis added that 90 per cent of such victims knew the person who 
committed the offence.

Despite the worryingly high figures, 
the first joint statistical overview of sexual offending in England and 
Wales by the Ministry of Justice, Home Office and Office of National 
Statistics highlights only a very small number of sex offences lead to a
 conviction.

In the last three years court 
statistics reveal an average of just 5,620 offenders are convicted each 
year for all types of sexual offences.

A total of 1,070 criminals were 
convicted for rape, according to the first joint overview of sexual 
offending in England and Wales as reported by the Guardian.

The report comes after Baroness Stern 
voiced her concerns over government ministers misleading the public 
about low rape conviction figures, which she said left victims feeling 
neglected and stopped women coming forward.

Lady Stern, a prison reform campaigner
 and human rights activist, called in her 2010 report for 'an end to the
 widespread use of misleading rape conviction data  -  in particular the
 six per cent conviction rate figure'.

The new figures show 62.5 per cent of 
rape cases ended in a conviction in 2011, eight per cent higher than in 
2005 where 800 were convicted.

More rapists are also being jailed for increasingly long sentences.

Yet rape crime remains under-reported 
to the police compared with other crimes, with only 15 per cent of women
 saying they had reported the offence to the police.

Martin Hewitt of the Association of 
Chief Police Officers told the Guardian that police had been working to 
encourage victims to report sex crimes.
