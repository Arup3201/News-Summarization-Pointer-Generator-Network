A 22-month-old girl who was left with three legs after she was separated from her conjoined twin in Panama has arrived in Los Angeles to undergo life-changing surgery.

Ana Paula was joined at the pelvis with her sister when they were born in a rural village in Panama, and the two girls were separated when they were 20 years old, but her sister did not survive.

After the surgery, Ana Paula was left three legs, three kidneys and possible reproductive issues.

At the weekend, she arrived in Los Angeles, where she will multiple procedures at Shriners Hospital for Children to remove two of her legs - procedures that she would not be able to have in Panama.

Welcome: 22-month-old Ana Paula gets a big welcome in Los Angeles airport after arriving from Panama

Fighter: She was born conjoined to her twin sister at the pelvis and was left with three legs after they were separated at 20 weeks. Only her left leg has function and the other two will be removed

The hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Kit Song, said her middle leg would be removed and that her right leg did not have a functional knee or foot so would likely be removed from above the knee, CBSLA reported.

She will then be fitted with a prosthetic and will hopefully be able to walk.

'I think she’ll be very functional as a 
walker, at the very least with crutches or with the arm crutches or 
something similar,' Dr. Phoebe Scott-Wyard said at a press conference.

Dr Song added: 'Will she 
be able to run and play like other children? No. She will 
be different than other children, but she will be able to move about and
 keep up with her peers.'

Life-changing: She arrived in LA with her mother, who says she hopes her daughter will be able to walk

Hopeful: Dr Kit Song, the chief of staff at the LA hospital, said her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable cases like it in the world each year - but that he knew his team could help

Twins who are joined at the pelvis, like Ana Paula was, can be fused at a 180 degree angle from each other in a condition known as 'Ischiopagi'.

The twins can share two legs, three legs - with the third often being two fused legs - or four legs. Ana Paula has been left with three legs, although one does not have any function and one has no function in the foot or knee.

As well as sharing the pelvic region, they can share the gastrointestinal tract and genital area. Most twins will need these regions reconstructed after they are separated. Both twins do often not make it through surgery.

About one in every 100,000 live births and one in 10 conjoined twin births are affected by the condition.

The toddler’s trip to Los Angeles was made possible by Shriners Hospitals and the Children of War Foundation, which secured funding for her medical costs and long-term rehabilitative care.

'My hope is that she will be fine and she will do well with her health … and she will also be able to walk,' Ana Paula's mother, Ileana Monrroy, said through a translator at the press conference.

Ana Paula will have her first surgery in a month, after doctors make a thorough plan of how to move forward.

'I think we can execute this very well,' Dr Song said. 'It's the thinking process behind the plan that’s going to take some time.'

Her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable 
cases like it in the world each year, he added.

Children of
 War Foundation aims to provide access to donated transformative 
surgical care for children who are living with a deformity or injuries 
that cannot be treated in their home country.

The
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern 
California provides care for the children once donations are secured.
