Moments after Jennifer Shedid had arrived home from school, a massive explosion shook her entire apartment block.

Knife-like shards of glass from the windows of her 4th-floor Beirut apartment flew across the room, slashing the 10-year-old from head to toe.

A neighbour helped her father carry Jennifer out of the rubble, before a soldier took the girl to an ambulance that sped off to the hospital.

An image, published in newspapers around the world, showed the girl being carried out with deep head and face wounds and her sneakers soaked red with blood following Friday's bomb blast.

But remarkably, after operations to remove the glass and repair her damaged veins, she survived.

Horrific injuries: A man carries Jennifer last Friday at the scene of the deadly explosion in Achrafiyeh, Beirut

Yesterday she was pictured in a 
hospital with more than 300 stitches in her body, 90 of them in her face
and head while and about 50 more on her hands. Her head was shaved and 
her face was swollen.

Jennifer's 17-year-old sister 
Jozianne, sitting in the lobby of the hospital, recounted the scene in 
their home just after the blast struck.

Jennifer was on the floor bleeding 
while Jozianne said she was thrown by the power of the blast and landed 
under a China cabinet where she suffered minor injuries.

'As I opened my eyes I saw that much 
of the apartment was turned upside down,' she told reporters. 'I stood 
up and started shouting "Jenny, Jenny" but no one answered.

'Then I found her next to a couch and
covered with debris that fell from the ceiling,' said Jozianne, who had
a bandage on her left brow from a glass injury.

'I screamed for help but no one 
answered,' said Jozianne, wearing a cross around her neck. 'I carried 
her and kept talking to her. I did not want her to go unconscious. She 
was holding me saying: “Help me”.'

Hope: Mrs Shedid, kisses her daughter Jennifer, who was seriously injured during the car bomb attack

Their father Richard was climbing the stairs to the apartment on his way
back from buying bread for the family when the car bomb struck on 
Friday afternoon less than 20 meters away, shaking doors and shattering 
his home.

He grabbed his bleeding daughter from the arms of her older sister Jozianne and rushed her downstairs.

'As I carried her down the stairs, she was trembling and telling me, 
"Please dad rescue me",' the father told The Associated Press on Monday.

'As we were in the ambulance, she was better but losing lots of blood,' said her father.

The blast, which hit the Shedids' narrow residential street in Beirut's 
predominantly Christian neighbourhood of Achrafieh, targeted Brigadier 
General Wissam al-Hassan, a top intelligence official who was one of the
most powerful opponents of Syria in Lebanon.

He was killed along with his bodyguard and a female civilian - a mother 
of three. It has sparked angry accusations from Syria's opponents in 
Lebanon that Damascus was behind the bombings.
Jennifer was one of the dozens wounded in the blast.

On Monday, as she lay in her hospital bed she smiled faintly, even 
managing to blow kisses to visiting reporters, calling out 'hi, hi.'

Antoine Younan, the doctor leading the team treating Jennifer, showed 
reporters on Monday a picture of the girl when she arrived at the 
hospital.

'Her body was riddled with glass wounds,' he said. Younan said Jennifer is in stable condition.

The veins of her right hands, severely damaged by the glass, are healing and she moved her fingers for the first time on Monday.

She underwent operations to remove the shards repair her veins and stitch her wounds.

Jennifer's mother Nisrin was at work on the other side of the city in the commercial neighbourhood of Hamra when she received a message on her phone about an explosion in her neighbourhood Achrafieh.

She jumped into a taxi, but had to get out about a mile away because cars were kept away from the scene to clear the roads for ambulances.

The mobile phone network was overloaded and she could not get through to her husband or children. But she did receive a call from her daughter's school that let her know she had arrived home in her school bus.

She ran toward her apartment. ‘I wanted to be with the children so that they would not be afraid,’ she said.

When she arrived at her street, security forces prevented her from reaching the building because the area was cordoned off for an investigation of the car bomb.

Then she saw something that made her collapse. ‘As I looked at the street, I saw Jennifer's shoes covered with blood,’ Nisrin said. ‘I bit my tongue and fainted.’

She was treated by a paramedic. When she asked him about her daughters, he took her to Jozianne.

‘When I saw the blood on Jozianne's clothes, I knew that Jennifer's injuries were serious,’ Nisrin said. She then received a call from the hospital where Jennifer was being treated and headed over.

A few hours after she arrived, Jennifer was taken out of the operating room and she saw her daughter wearing a green hospital gown.

‘I looked at her. My heart broke,’ the mother told journalists outside the Intensive Care Unit where Jennifer has been since Friday.

Jennifer, a top student in her 5th grade class, loves drawing and taking pictures with the mobile phones of her parents and sister. She is no fan of science or maths but loves reading and sports.

Her favourite cartoon is Tom and Jerry. On Sundays, she goes with her Maronite Christian family to church for prayers.

On Monday, Jennifer opened her eyes from the latest operation and started communicating for the first time. ‘My happiness today is beyond explanation,’ said her mother Nisrin.
