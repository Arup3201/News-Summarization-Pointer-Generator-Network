New Year's Day may only seem good for a bleary-eyed lunch with the in-laws. But it seems a deluge of shoppers are hauling themselves out of bed - and returning those Christmas rejects.

Today will see more presents exchanged than any other, claims a report by business analysts, and the number could hit a record high thanks to the rise of online shopping.

With a string of shopping centres up and down Britain opening as late as 9pm, the day has been dubbed Boomerang Thursday by the analysts.

Ready to hit the shops... again? A report claims today will see a peak of gift returns - despite a public holiday

Some 29million unwanted presents are being returned from online shops alone this year with an expected value of £600million, estimates the report by LCP Consulting.

The firm, which advises businesses on their supply chains, said past figures suggest 15 per cent of all online presents are returned - and around 200million were set to be delivered over Christmas.

Despite the public holiday - and for people who work long hours, because of it - the report claimed many Christmas presents will be returned today.

Many returns of goods originally ordered online will happen in person, it added, thanks to quicker refunds and the added lure of the sales.

The firm's founder Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield University in Bedford, said some departments faced having more than half of all their sales returned.

That could pose a challenge for small independent shops which rely on Christmas income, and prompt long till queues at big-name chains which have an online ordering arm. 

Of shops opening on New Year's Day, he said: 'I think the retailers want to maximise the available time to persuade customers to spend their money, especially those without much free time.

'Some retailers such as John Lewis are still not opening, but those in a less strong position will be concerned not to lose the opportunity.

Scramble: Shoppers on Black Friday in Wembley, north London. The trend is among several promoting impulse buys which analysts say can lead to a higher number of gifts being returned in the cold light of day

'The most-returned items will be high fashion - trendy things given as gifts, and people may have bought one or two because they weren't sure what would fit, so one has to be returned.' 

His colleague Phil Streatfield claimed the massive number of refunds and returns creates 'more pressure than ever for retailers to be slicker in managing their refund process'.

He added: 'This will be a critical factor for future success, and become part of a new and increasingly complex battleground.'

The firm claimed 600,000 orders from Cyber Monday will have required redelivering, many of them before Christmas Day. It estimated the average gift as costing £20.

Major shopping centres will be opening long hours today, despite New Year's Day historically being quiet.

London's two sprawling Westfield malls will be open from 10am to 9pm, while shops at the Trafford Centre in Manchester - Britain's largest - are open until 6pm.

The huge Bluewater mall in Greenhithe, Kent, will be open until 7pm while the Liverpool One centre will be open until 6pm. 

Shops in London's Oxford Street - still recovering from the capital's excesses last night - will be open until 7pm. 

Not everyone has succumbed to the pressures of consumerism. Gateshead's MetroCentre, the second-largest shopping centre in the country, will be almost completely closed today.

And with a YouGov poll showing we spent £604 per household on gifts, perhaps some people just can't bear the thought of hitting the shops again. Especially with that hangover.
