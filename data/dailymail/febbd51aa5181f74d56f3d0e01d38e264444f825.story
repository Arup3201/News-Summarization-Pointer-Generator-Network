Tragedy: Lucy Woolley, 16, died after falling from her eventing horse after it was startled by a tractor

A girl of 16 with a passion for riding was killed when a tractor startled her horse and she was thrown off.

Lucinda Woolley, who had taken part in national eventing competitions, had gone out on her horse Alfie, a recent gift from her parents.

Her mother Julia, 48, rushed to find her daughter when the horse returned to their £875,000 country home without her.

Lucinda was airlifted to hospital with head injuries and died the next day.

Mrs Woolley said that she and her husband Peter, 52, had been reluctant to give the teenager Alfie, who was a professional eventing horse, but riding was ‘what she lived for’.

The grieving mother, who runs a media management and financial consultancy business with her husband in Chattisham, near Ipswich, said: ‘Alfie got spooked by the vehicle – it was a fluke.

'The chap who was driving the tractor is a personal friend. I heard the horse come back to the stables and chased off to find her.

'I was there within five minutes of the fall.’

Mrs Woolley said her daughter was wearing a helmet and all the protective equipment one would expect to see on ‘a professional’, adding: ‘She was a very diligent and careful rider. She was wearing all of her protective gear. She wouldn’t have gone out without it.’

She added: ‘Her passion was riding. She had been riding since the age of three and had had a succession of horses.

Talented: Lucy had been riding since the age of three and had already competed at a national level

Passion: Lucy's mother said she was a diligent student but riding was her true love

According to her mother, Lucinda's passion was riding. She had been riding since the age of three and had had a succession of horses

‘She had got to the point of 
competing at British Eventing level – a very high level – and other 
people who were more expert than us were kind enough to say she was a 
very talented rider.

'Yes, it was a very dangerous sport 
and we had given a lot of thought to giving her the horse she had. We 
agreed that she could compete at that level and that’s what she lived 
for.’

Lucinda had been waiting to find out her GCSE results at £11,700-a-year Ipswich High School for Girls.

She was due to start her A-level 
studies in September. Mrs Woolley said she and her husband had tried not
to tell their daughter too often how beautiful and talented she was to 
help her keep her feet on the ground.

Heartbreak: Riding experts had said Lucy, pictured in family photos, had a bright future in the sport ahead of her

‘She had the biggest smile and an 
amazing, infectious laugh and sense of humour. She was very determined, 
organised and focused. She was sporty and played hockey and rounders for
the school.’

Lucinda’s 18-year-old sister 
Charlotte wrote on her personal blog:  ‘She was airlifted to 
Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and after being in surgery for 3 
hours we finally got to see her.

‘The next day she showed signs of 
breathing but she was still so ill that both her heart rate and blood 
pressure rocketed and doctors told us the news we had feared.

‘Poor little Lucy was only 16 and so beautiful, an incredible rider and so loved by so many.

'Mum and I will hopefully be going to collect her GCSE results for her on the 22nd, which she no doubt will have aced.’
