For one father, trying to make the best of his daughter's eye problem is as simple as being creative with a marker pen.

Layla Grubb, 11 months, was born with a cataract in her right eye so she must wear a patch on her left eye for two hours a day to strengthen it.

So her father Geoffrey Grubb, 31, from the Midwest, US,  simply draws a new design on her patch every day 'to make it fun' and takes a picture.

The adorable baby was born with a small cataract that affects the sight in her right eye so in order to help the injured eye develop properly, she has worn a patch over her stronger eye for two months.

She won't need surgery and the family hope patching will be enough but she will continue to have to wear one until she's four or five years old. 

Stay-at-home father Geoffrey said he quickly came up with the idea to decorate them. 

'We bought some patches for her and they were a little weird to look at, so I started drawing on them the next day to make it more fun for both of us,' he said. 

'She's too young to really know what's going on but I always show her the pictures before I put it on. She likes the pictures but she's much happier when it's time to take it off.'

In the pictures, Layla certainly seems a very sunny baby and always has a big smile.

Geoffrey takes pictures of Layla every day and sends them to his family. 

He has drawn a range of designs on her skin-coloured patches including eyes inspired by  Spider-Man, Bishop from X Men, Catwoman, as well as a heart and a floating balloon.

And so far he has come up with original drawing every day. 

He said: 'The designs are mostly pop culture things that I think will be funny or cute. I haven't repeated any yet and I snap a picture with my iPhone every day.

It even doubles as a name badge! Geoffrey writes his daughter's name in block capitals and colours them red

Babies and toddlers wear patches to help the eye send correct messages to the brain to prevent a lazy eye from developing.

This occurs when the vision in one eye doesn't fully develop during childhood and can't necessarily be corrected with glasses in later life.

Geoffrey posted the pictures and Layla's predicament on the social media website Reddit, noting that she often rubs her patch and gets irritable.

His fellow users offered messages of support about their own experiences of wearing eye patches and some invaluable advice. 

Geoffrey said: 'The best advice I received was to put a little Vaseline on her eyebrow so the patch doesn't rip her hair out when I take it off. I thought that was genius.'
