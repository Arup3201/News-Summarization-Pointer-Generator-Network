This is the moment a rogue recycling boss who was twice caught dumping waste had his signature white van crushed into a block.

Ian Chapman, 56 - whose slogan was 'recycle it, don't tip it' - was convicted in 2010 and again last year after Newcastle City Council spent weeks following him through covert surveillance.

The council seized his van and twisted it into a ball of scrap at a yard in Byker, Newcastle, to set an example to others.

Crushed: Council chiefs in Newcastle have destroyed rogue scrap boss Ian Chapman's white van

Rogue: Ian Chapman's catchphrase was 'recycle it - don't tip it'. He was caught twice by council officers

Chapman set up Fast Track Recycling in 2006 and received his most serious conviction in 2010.

He was prosecuted for 
dumping and burning waste including dangerous chemicals yards from family homes.

Environmental 
Health officers, who received a flurry of complaints, put Chapman under surveillance and found mounds of scrap including a plastic bath, wheelbarrow, gas heater, vacuum cleaner, as 
well as washing machines, ovens, drain pipes, corrugated metal fence 
panels and filing cabinet drawers.

Officers
 were also alarmed to see refrigeration units and air conditioning 
devices among the piles, which had been stripped-back, allowing 
dangerous chemicals to be released into the atmosphere.

He denied depositing controlled waste, but was found guilty in 2010 and was ordered to carry out 150 hours' community service, ordered to pay 
£200 costs and £60 victim surcharge.

Probe: The council followed Chapman for three weeks until they had enough evidence in 2010

Evidence: Dumped fridges at the compound which prosecutors said was used by Ian Chapman

The van was seized but Chapman appealed his conviction, and it could not be destroyed until Chapman lost that appeal this year.

Meanwhile he racked up another conviction in September last year after he began dumping scrap materials again - without a licence.

Chapman was spotted disposing a bucket of rubbish and dumping roofing illegally.

During an interview with officers, he claimed he was out walking his dog. But like it had in 2010, CCTV and undercover images showed him dumping waste illegally.

After the offence last year Chapman, from Ponteland, Northumberland, pleaded guilty to one count of not 
being a registered carrier and received a year's conditional discharge.

City councillor and chairman of Safe Newcastle Linda Hobson said: 'Ian Chapman’s conviction and the destruction of his vehicle should send a message loud and clear that Newcastle City Council, with the police, will not hesitate in seeking the maximum penalty possible.

Twisted metal: The council seized the truck and had to fight a long legal process to have it crushed

Claws: The van was destroyed near where Chapman had been trading in scrap metal in Newcastle

Pleased: Council enforcement officers Gavin Bell and Andrew Dixon with the remains of Ian Chapman's van

'Fly-tipping will not pay, and indeed will cost anyone stupid enough to do it very dearly.'

'We know from surveys that fly-tipping is something that really offends our residents, so we are determined to act decisively when this crime is committed.

'Fly-tippers cost councils millions of pounds every year and, quite frankly, in the current financial climate we need the money for other services that people depend upon.'
