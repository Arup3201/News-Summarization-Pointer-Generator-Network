Valentine’s Day is a day away, but for those looking to find a date, how can you tell if someone is interested?

Well, fortunately, researchers have worked out the science of flirting, to find out what people do most often if they are attracted in another person.

And the results are in: Starting off being encouraging and complimentary, and ending by being expressive and using open palm gestures, is a sure-fire way that someone is interested.

A University of Kansas study looked at the science of flirting (stock image shown). 102 men and women took part in a study to find what people did when they were attracted to a member of the opposite sex. The results show that people were encouraging and complimentary - at first

The research was led by associate professor of communication studies Dr Jeffrey Hall  from the University of Kansas.

His team gathered 102 heterosexual men and women - split 50:50 - who had never met before, partnered them up in conversations for 10 to 12 minutes and recorded them on video.

Afterward, subjects reported their level of attraction toward their conversation partners. Then, Dr Hall and his team reviewed the interactions - and what signs of flirtation they had shown.

1-3 minutes

If someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say, it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers.

Some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation.

Crossing legs at any point, though, was a sign that a person was not interested in the other.

Also, if a woman doesn't ask many questions, or shrugs a lot, she probably isn't interested. 

4-6 minutes

If the person is still attracted to you, they will likely be even more affirmative, and also still quite complimentary.

They will also begin ‘palming' - talking using open palm gestures.

7-9 minutes

Now, people start to do-away with compliments.

Instead, men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point, while women might start to divulge some personal details.

10-12 minutes

At the end of the conversation, women will open up and be joyful, while still palming, if they are still interested.

For women, you’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction. This means they are still interested.

The results suggest that, in general, in the first three minutes of conversation, people gave their partner a flirtatious glance if they were attracted to them.

They also dished out a few compliments, and liked to be affirmative - being in agreement, passing encouragement or nodding along.

In the next three minutes, people were even more affirmative, and still quite complimentary.

At this point, they also become very keen on ‘palming’ - which means talking while using open palm gestures.

In the next three minutes, though, people no longer relied on compliments.

Throughout the conversation, but particularly at this point, men gazed at the women if they were attracted to them, while women who started sharing personal details were interested.

In the final three minutes of the conversation, the best thing to look for if you’re a man is a woman who opens up, is smiling and laughing along, and is palming. 

For women, look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the early part of the interaction.  

But there were also some indicators of what people did when they were not interested, as well.

For example, crossing legs at any point was a clear sign that someone was not attracted in the other person in the conversation.

Touching the arm, chest, hair or so on was also a sign they were losing interest, while teasing was also something not really favoured.

In addition, a woman who didn’t like the guy she was taking to typically didn’t ask him questions and shrugged, perhaps in indifference early on.

By the end of the interaction, men who weren’t interested started crossing their arms, showing their lack of interest.

Towards the end of a conversation, women become more expressive. Men, on the other hand, tend to lower the pitch of their voice later on. But crossed legs at any point are a clear sign someone isn't interested. And if a woman doesn't ask any questions, it's not a good sign (stock image shown)

*Note: These were the conversation prompt cards used in the study

Before the study, people self-identified their flirting styles in a questionnaire, breaking them down into physical, traditional, sincere, polite or playful flirts.

The results are an amalgamation of the different types combined. 

The participants were given comfy blue chairs, with a coffee table nearby, when engaging in conversations with a partner.

And they also had prompts that would help the conversations flow.

Dr Hall explained: ‘We had prompt cards to read with questions to help them learn about other person, such as “what accomplishment are you most proud of?"

‘These were meant to get the conversation going.’ 

First, they analysed the frequency of different types of flirting across all the groups. In total, 26 were identified, although some included groups of actions.

The most popular was being joyful, such as laughing or smiling.

In second was being affirmative, or in other words nodding and being in agreement with their partner when they were talking.

Keeping the conversation flowing was also something most people aspired towards, while people preferred to have their arms open than closed.

The technique that was performed least frequently was teasing the other person. The next least popular was being complimentary.

Next, people rarely chose to ‘fall into their chair’ - which meant sitting back in surprise or excitement - and they also weren’t that keen on using flirtatious glances, either.

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Hall said he found some aspects of the research particularly interesting.

‘The most fascinating thing for me was teasing for everybody, whatever style, was negative in regards to being attractive,’ he said. 

In the final three minutes of the conversation, the best thing to look for if you’re a man is a woman who opens up, is smiling and laughing along, and is palming (an open palm gesture, such as in this stock image). For women, look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction

Another interesting indicator was that people who had a polite style of flirting tended to give their partner respect.

They would lean back in their chair, create a distance between then, and be more evenly toned in their speech.

He said that polite flirts thus had a hard time getting their message across, even if they were interested.

So, what are Dr Hall’s dating tips? He says that, while there are general indicators, you should play close attention to what type of person your partner is.

‘Knowing your own flirting style, and knowing that of other people, can tell you about their intentions and what they expect out of it,’ he said.

‘Certain types give you clues about their style and ways of communication.’

He says you want to be direct, but not too embarrassing or forward, and always be on the eye out for non-verbal indicators, such as smiling and laughing or being engaged in the conversation.
