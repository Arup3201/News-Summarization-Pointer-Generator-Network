'We have nothing here, but we have everything.'

These are the words used by one local to describe Barbuda - Antigua's smaller, lesser-known neighbour, with whom it forms a twin island state that floats dreamily in the eastern Caribbean and which was, until independence in 1981, British.

The island had a moment of recognition in the Nineties when it became a favourite holiday spot of Princess Diana's, but has otherwise remained below the radar.

Meet the outsider: Less fabled Barbuda has a quiet vibe that is encapsulated by the sands of Gravenor Bay

When I say I am heading there, people mistakenly hear either 'Barbados' or 'Bermuda'.

Today, there are only three places to accommodate the few hundred odd guests who make it to Barbuda each year.

The most interesting of these is North Beach - five bungalows set on stilts over a desolate stretch of beach, accessible only by boat, on a headland at the windy northern tip of the island.

It is to this remotest of locations that my friend Sarah - a fellow harassed mother of single-digit-aged children - and I decamp for some winter sun and solace. We arrive via a Virgin Atlantic flight from London, followed by a 14-minute white-knuckle ride on a seven-seat propeller plane from Antigua.

After touching down on a tiny airstrip, we are whisked through the airport (a pink hut) and across the village of Codrington - which was named for the British family who settled it in the 1600s and is nothing more than a few streets lined with colourful houses (many with generations of families idling together on the doorstep), a grocer's and knick-knack shops, with no traffic lights and few cars.

A 25-minute speedboat ride through Codrington Lagoon brings us to North Beach.

The first thing I notice - but for the wind - is the stillness of the place. Colette, the only full-time member of staff, ambles down the dock to meet us without any of the bustle or forced solicitousness customary in these situations.

There isn't a welcoming glass of fruit punch or a cool towel in sight.

We are deposited in our cottage with hardly a wave. Pared down in the extreme, there are white walls, hardwood floors, green net curtains and some basic wicker furniture.

No mirror. No hairdryer. No phone or TV. No art on the walls.

Built by native Barbudan Reuben James 30 years ago, there is no sign that North Beach has been upgraded since. As a tangle of MacBook, iPhone, Kindle and digital camera chargers spill out of my suitcase, I wonder how well I will fit in here. And what on earth I will do.

The website boasts of no spa, pool, children's club, sushi, dancing, or watersports.

To this list I would add that there are no menus, no wine that I wanted to drink, no housekeeping service and no hot water.

There is also meant to be no internet, so that guests will go 'off-grid' and truly relax.

But, like an alcoholic sneaking his poison into rehab through a shampoo bottle, I circumvent this, procuring the back office wifi code 'for work' and huddling in the dining room hut - the only place with a signal - for my fix.

A place to escape the world: Charlotte found her retreat at North Beach (but had to beg for a wifi connection)

For most of our stay, the only other guests are an older American couple. 'I chose this place to help my husband break his screen addiction,' the wife tells me, winking, as I tap away on my iPhone.

Our paths cross rarely, though, as we all drift around in our enforced idleness.

A few loungers dot the beach and we spend most of our time horizontal on these, rising every so often to re-angle ourselves towards the sun. Occasionally, a stray donkey wanders past.

Meals entail appearing in the Formica-tiled dining hut whenever hunger (or boredom) strikes and being presented by Colette, a woman of few words and not a great deal of action, with two options scrawled on an envelope.

Offerings are whatever has been caught that day, usually Caribbean spiny lobster, conch or snapper, by 'Straight', the friendly boat-driver.

After a couple of days of doing my damnedest to get into the 'non-swing' of things — lazing on the beach with a book, swimming, snorkelling and trying to space out wifi visits - I am about as relaxed as I get (if not relaxed by Barbudan standards), and ready for a tour of this 62-square-mile island.

Straight, thankfully, obliges.

This will do for lunch: Charlotte found herself eating lobster at Uncle Roddy's - after a little persuasion

Barbuda's only 'attraction', besides its empty beaches, is the Frigate Bird Sanctuary.

The Codrington Lagoon is home to the largest population of Frigate birds in the western hemisphere, who nest in their thousands amid the mangrove swamps - the males puffing out their chests into red balloons to attract mates.

Restaurants do not seem to exist on Barbuda, which has only 1,500 residents and three full-board hotels. An enthusiastic man tries to persuade us to eat jerk chicken from the side of the road for lunch. But when we, more doggedly, refuse, he - clearly amused by the high-maintenance English journalist and her blonde friend — agrees to 'call Roddy and see if he has any lobsters'.

Luckily, he does.

Uncle Roddy's is a simple beach hut, where we are welcomed warmly, presented with grilled lobsters and local Wadadli beers and regaled with stories.

A few steps away is Princess Diana Beach, so named because of her patronage of the nearby K-Club resort - which closed eight years ago and sits derelict.

Some locals, Roddy included, are disappointed with its Italian owner, Mariuccia Mandelli of fashion label Krizia, for damaging tourism by refusing to sell the land for redevelopment.

Blissful scenes: An encounter with a local donkey and a day on the water, on a true Caribbean gem

Others are relieved that Barbuda's privacy has been safeguarded.

It doesn't surprise me that this island would have been a foil to Diana's crazy existence.

As I stroll along one of the famous pink sand beaches, I can imagine what a simpler life might feel like, one without deadlines and devices.

Apparently, a supermarket magnate from nearby St Maarten has just bought a large stretch of coastline, on which to build a luxury development, so Barbuda might go the blingy way of other islands - a prospect that has split local opinion, much as the closure of the K-Club has.

But I suppose the island cannot remain under wraps for ever.

And, though its desertedness challenged me, I am glad to have experienced it. Next time, I might even leave my gadgets behind and just recharge myself.
