Raw, undistorted power. That’s what Atomic Floyd claim their latest creation, the PowerJax, has in spades.

And thankfully, within seconds of putting them in your ears, it’s clear that they’re every bit as monstrous as expected.

Raw power: There are few earphones of similar price that deliver such smooth low-end thump 

The PowerJax take some of the best elements from the existing Atomic Floyd headphones and wraps them in a £99 package.

The result is a pair of earphones packed with the latest soundproofing technology, world-class audio components and exquisite build quality.

Sharp, crisp sound is achieved through their 13.5mm dynamic drivers, while a metal voice coil enriches the sound.

The oversized 5mm angled nozzle injects the music straight into the sweet spot, too.

There’s a strong depth of sound, perhaps slightly weaker than the more expensive SuperDarts, but instrument distinction is wonderful.

There’s enough bass available through most amplitudes, but is at its best through the mid-range.

Vocals cut through the low-end thump brilliantly, although at higher volumes become slightly overpowered.

Distortion, though, is kept at a minimum, and coupled with excellent noise insulation, ensures a wonderfully immersive experience.

As much time has been spent on the PowerJax’s aesthetics, too.

The enlarged acoustic chambers are a result of injection-moulded steel – further enhancing sound quality, while reinforcing their aggressive character.

There’s more than a hint of SuperDarts about their design – albeit slightly less flashy, but the overarching sense of clinical efficiency is impossible to ignore in the PowerJax’s crisp, sharp curves.

The cable is manufactured from high-performance Kevlar with a low-friction TPU coating to stop tangling. While a stainless steel remote allows you to answer phone calls with a touch of a button.

To ensure a snug fit, with SoftSeal eartips in three sizes – Small, medium and large.

Pound for pound, the PowerJax earphones punch well above their weight.
