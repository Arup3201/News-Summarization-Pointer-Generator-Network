Sarah Ross admitted harassing her ex-boyfriend Christopher Wood and his wife Nicola, who won a lifetime restraining order against her

A postman and his wife have won a lifetime restraining order against his jealous ex-girlfriend who spent a month bombarding them with 800 menacing phone calls.

Christopher Wood, 35, was subjected to a hate campaign by Sarah Ross, 25, after she discovered he had married another former pupil from her primary school.

She sent text and Facebook messages repeatedly calling Mr Wood's bride Nicola a 'slag' and adding, 'I wish you would die'.

When Mrs Wood, 33, suffered a miscarriage, Ross allegedly called them 'baby killers', a court heard.

In January and February this year, mother-of-one Ross made repeated phone calls to the couple's home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where they live with children aged five and ten, which were either silent or contained threats.

She was also suspected of putting a brick through the couple's front window. In a later message, she then bragged: 'You are not going to win. As for me smashing your window, nothing will happen to me.'

When Ross was arrested and charged she claimed she had rekindled her relationship with Mr Wood - and even became pregnant by him but lost the baby.

At Macclesfield Magistrates Court, the brunette, who gave her name as Sarah Martin, clutched a pink teddy bear as she was spared jail due to 'complex family issues'.

She was handed a six-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and was banned from having any contact with the couple indefinitely.

Hours after the case she posted a creepy smiling 'selfie' on Facebook.

At his home yesterday, Mr Wood branded Ross a 'fantasist' and added: 'She had my wife frightened, she sent her death threats - she's a loose cannon.

'We lost our baby and she still didn't 
stop. She breached her original bail and put our window through. I have 
been off work two months with the stress. She should have gone to prison
 for what she did.'

Christopher Wood and his wife Nicola were bombarded with phone calls and messages after Ross found out they were married

The court 
heard that Ross, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, had been in a brief 
relationship with Mr Wood from August 2012 until February 2013, during 
which time she relocated from her home town of Edinburgh to be closer to
 him.

In
 the same time period, she became 'best friends' with Nicola as their 
children were in the same class at school, the court heard.

But just 
two months after splitting up with Mr Wood, Ross became aware he and 
Nicola were in a relationship. The couple then married in June of last 
year.

Prosecutor
 Simon Pover said of the Wood family: 'They are together as a family 
with two young school-age children and also expected a child of their 
own. Sadly she lost that baby on Christmas Eve and that appears to have 
been something referred to in the harassment.

'Following the loss of their child the 
defendant continued with the abuse which caused them and the two 
children some distress and alarm.

'There were a significant number of silent phone calls - up to 800. There were also text messages sent and Mr Wood had concerns at work. There were approaches made to employees but this was dealt with sympathetically.'

On January
 22 Ross was served with a harassment notice to try and halt her 
behaviour, but just five days later her campaign began again.

Mr
 Pover said: 'There were a number of messages on Facebook which said, 
'hate you slag, wish you would die slag. Nice try slag but you are not 
going to win. As for me smashing your window, nothing will happen to 
me.'

'Once 
proceedings began there have been instances of her bail being breached. 
She now accepts that she pursued a course of harassment of Christopher 
and Nicola Wood.

'She accepts making approximately 800 telephone calls to the complainants, the majority of which were silent.

Ross made silent and threatening phone calls to Mr and Mrs Wood and sent them abusive messages on Facebook

'She denies instances when she is alleged to have called the complainants baby killers but she accepts sending various Facebook messages calling Mrs Wood a slag.'

Ross admitted harassment was sentenced on the basis the words 'baby killers' were not used. She said she had stopped taking medication for bi-polar disorder.

The court heard her five-year-old daughter was born with a number of conditions including Asperger's and poor sight and hearing.

Her lawyer Anthony Derbyshire said: 'She accepts making nuisance calls and accepts the numbers of calls. She accepts her behaviour was unnacceptable but she denies calling them baby killers.'

Sentencing Ross, magistrate Denise Rankin said: 'The courts take harassment very seriously indeed. It is not anything the courts condone nor should anybody do this in the community to effect anybody else.

'It is aggravated by the number of telephone calls and texts and it was over a short period of time. It was intentional and there was harm and distress caused to the complainants and their wider family.

'I acknowledge the complex family issues but do not condone this type of action.'
