Franz Beckenbauer's ban imposed while he was investigated for failing to comply with the probe into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has been revoked.

The former Germany player and manager was forced to abandon his plans to come to the World Cup in Brazil as a TV pundit after the provisional ban was imposed.

Beckenbauer then said he would meet FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia about the 2010 vote - when he was a FIFA executive committee - and his ban has now been revoked, but the investigation into him for failing to comply continues.

Revoked! Franz Beckenbauer's 90-day ban has been removed after just 15

A FIFA statement said: 'The decision to provisionally ban Franz Beckenbauer was revoked today by the deputy chairman of the independent ethics committee's adjudicatory chamber, Alan Sullivan QC.

'Having received the appropriate submissions, Alan Sullivan QC considered that it was appropriate at the time to impose provisional measures.

'However, Sullivan QC, considering that a breach of the FIFA ethics code appeared to have been committed, concluded that all the conditions for the imposition of provisional measures were no longer fulfilled.'

Sullivan did however issue a warning to Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as both a player and a manager.

The statement added: 'The deputy chairman warned Mr Beckenbauer that a repetition or continuation of the conduct that led to the imposition of the provisional measure might give rise to further sanctions, including new provisional measures.

'The investigation proceedings... which will determine whether Mr Beckenbauer violated provisions of the FIFA code of ethics, are ongoing.'
