It's an art that divides opinion but no-one can deny the fantastical taxidermy produced by the Victorians pushed creative boundaries.

One of the best was British taxidermist, Walter Potter, whose eccentric creations included rabbit schoolchildren and cigar-smoking squirrels.

Now his unusual oeuvre is the subject of a new book that includes a carefully curated selection of photos of his finest works. 

In Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy, photographs of some of his most famous taxidermy projects are featured

Potter, who died in 1918, specialised in anthropomorphic tableaux that became some of the most famous examples of the Victorian penchant for all things whimsical.

Like his contemporary, Beatrix Potter (no relation), Potter's work focused on the cuter members of the animal kingdom, with squirrels, rabbits and kittens among his favourite subjects.

Despite the cutesy scenes for which he is famous, Potter was also a fan of other taxidermist's work, eventually amassing more than 10,000 pieces.

Most went into a tiny museum in that he owned in Bramber, Sussex, and included a multi-legged kitten, a two-headed lamb, and a bewildering assortment of other curios.

Potter's inspired and beguiling creations of squirrels playing cards, kittens enjoying an afternoon of croquet, rabbits diligently at their schoolwork, and more have found fans in the contemporary art world and beyond

In spite of his enthusiasm for collecting, it was his beguiling tableaux featuring squirrels playing cards, kittens enjoying an afternoon of croquet, rabbits diligently at their schoolwork, that gained him legions of fans in the art world and beyond.

And it is these striking creations that are the focus of the new book on his work, which features pieces chosen taxidermy expert Dr. Pat Morris and new photographs by Joanna Ebenstein.

Darkly witty and affecting, Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy makes a charming, whimsical (and yes, slightly morbid) gift.

Wlater Potter's tiny museum in Bramber, Sussex, included a multi-legged kitten, a two-headed lamb, and a bewildering assortment of other curios.

During the Victorian era, taxidermy - or the art of stuffing and preserving dead animals - was enormously popular.

Many, like Potter who made his first attempt at taxidermy as a teenager when his pet canary died, were amateur enthusiasts, although others went on to create pieces as a professional.

Whether amateur or pro, taxidermy involves skinning the subject before applying tanning or preserving chemicals to the skin.

Next, the skin is mounted on a mannequin made from wood, wire or wool before eyes made from clay or glass are added.

Although modern taxidermists generally use traditional means to preserve their animal subjects, some have embraced expensive freeze drying while others, particularly those who specialise in fish, create lifelike resin sculptures using the subject's measurements and let the real beast swim off.
