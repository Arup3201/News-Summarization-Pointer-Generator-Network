It's a murder case that has been ongoing for 12 years, but on Tuesday it took a Miami jury just two and half hours to convict Michel Escoto of the first degree murder of his wife, Wendy Trapaga.

Escoto sat emotionless as the decision was ready, while Trapaga's mother cried and through her hands up in prayer, overwhelmed that her daughter can finally rest in peace.

The 42-year-old was found guilty of killing his 21-year-old bride in Otcober 2002, just four days after their wedding, in order to claim her $1 million life insurance policy.

'The truth is out and heâ€™s finally going to pay after almost 12 years,' Rita Stephan, Trapaga's sister, told CBS.

In the closing arguments of Escoto's murder trial in Miami-Dade Circuit Court on Monday, prosecutor Gail Levine told jurors that Escoto had planned to drug Trapaga with crushed up sleeping pills and drown her in the jacuzzi of a Miami hotel they had booked into.

But the plan failed when Trapaga woke up in the water.

He then strangled her and beat her to death with a tire iron, dumping her body in a Miami-Dade warehouse district.

The closing arguments brought to an end a month of testimony that included more than 20 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence, The Miami Herald reported.

Escoto, 42, who represented himself for most of the trial, is charged with first-degree murder and is likely to be sentenced to life in prison as a result of the guilty verdict.

Escoto's behavior throughout the trial has caused much courtroom drama.

At one point, Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez sentenced Escoto to 30 days in jail for contempt of court after he threatened Jorge Borron, the civil lawyer for Trapagas family, who was testifying and proclaimed Escoto a murderer.

'For a moment, you got to see the real Michel Escoto,' Levine told jurors.

'Those are his true colors.'

On Monday he surprised observers by allowing 'stand-by' counsel Terry Lenamon to finish the case.

Lenamon attacked the prosecution's case, saying the state exaggerated and over-dramatized the evidence during the 'vilification of Michel Escoto'.

Yolanda Cerrillo was the star witness in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014. She testified that she helped Escoto plan and carry out the murder of his new bride, Wendy Trapaga, 21, in 2002

The prosecution called Yolanda Cerillo 'evil, pathetic and selfish' after she admitted to helping murder Wendy Trapaga

'This is not community theater,' Lenamon said.

'This is a court of law.'

Escoto was long the suspect in Trapaga's death.

Prosecutors described him as a womanizer who kept several ex-girlfriends, even as he planned Trapaga's demise.

He persuaded her to go along with the life insurance policy while pressuring her to marry him in a rushed courthouse wedding.

A few days after the ceremony they checked into the Executive Airport Motel at 6700 NW 12th St.

To police, he initially claimed the two left the motel after getting into an argument, and she stormed off on her own after dropping him off at their South Beach apartment.

The defense speculated that Trapaga, who they had 'multiple boyfriends' and 'was going to sex clubs', met up with someone who was the real killer.

'We don't know what occurs after she left the apartment,' Lenamon said.

Prosecutors shot back, citing the medical examination of her body - Trapaga was too drugged-up to have been able to drive Escoto home that night.

The state also had a powerful witness for the trial.

Escoto's ex-girlfriend, Yolanda Cerrillo, who admitted to jurors she helped him plan the murder by grinding up powerful painkillers to knock Trapaga out.

Together they also practiced how to drown the young woman, Cerrillo said.

She also admitted to whisking him away from the crime scene and agreeing on a cover story.

The details were intimate: Cerrillo described how the smell of blood made her so ill she had diarrhea and had to defecate on the side of a causeway as Escoto flung the murder weapon into Biscayne Bay.

'You don't make that up,' Levine said.

Cerrillo, 40, a Homestead accountant, began cooperating in 2006, but admitted she failed to tell investigators the full extent of her involvement until August 2011.

The state attorney's office, with little evidence against her, had no choice but to grant her immunity from prosecution.

'One sorry, pathetic soul. Evil. Selfish,' Levine told jurors, adding:

'I can't charge her. I'd love to. But I can't.'

Last fall, a civil jury ordered Cerrillo to pay Trapaga's family $44 million in a wrongful death lawsuit.

The defense, however, insisted that Cerrillo concocted the entire story only after she believed Escoto might have implicated her.
