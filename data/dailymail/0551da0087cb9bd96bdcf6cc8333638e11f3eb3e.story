These fish - no longer than two inches long - have sparked a court case and emergency clear-up operation costing the taxpayer up to £205,000.

The Environment Agency launched the action after they found topmouth gudgeon, an invasive Asian alien species, in a private fishery that feeds into a major river in Devon.

Despite their tiny size, the fish could have wiped out the local eco-system by mass-breeding and out-competing native rivals for food.

It is not clear how they entered the 40 acre Clawford 
Lakes fishery near Holsworthy, Devon, although it is suspected an angler introduced them.

Such was the concern about the potential damage, Government officials spent five weeks mounting an operation to remove hundreds of native coarse fish like carp and eel from the fishery.

After scooping them out one by one in nets, they held them in quarantine while the affected water was treated with a chemical that killed off the invasive minnows. These actions alone cost £170,000 of public money.

Meanwhile the owners of the fishery, John and Wanda Ray, were prosecuted for 
keeping non-native fish without permission under the Import of Live Fish
Act 1980.

The couple were fined £4,950 and ordered to pay £30,000 costs.

The site flows into the River Claw which is a tributory to the River Tamar, that is rich in salmon, and its owners landed themselves in deep water after they advertised to anglers on their website that they were stocking a species of fish that turned out to also be illegal.

This prompted officials from the Environment Agency to pay and visit and they found no sign of the advertised fish - but did find thousands of topmouth gudgeon.

The couple were given a period of time to remove the minnows but when agency staff returned to find nothing had been done, they took direct action themselves.

Mike Dunning, a spokesman for the Environment Agency, said: 'We were alerted to the fishery because they advertised that they had rosy minnow in their lakes.

They are an invasive species, so we went to investigate but didn’t actually find any of them. Instead, we found the topmouth gudgeon.

'The owners hadn’t put the fish in the water themselves, so they must have been carried in on an anglers equipment.

'We warned the owners that they had to find a way to treat the problem, but when we returned that hadn’t done anything about it.

'Then we decided to remove them. We scooped out each native fish in nets, and put them into a quarantined pond.

'Then we treated the water with a chemical that killed the topmouth gudgeon, and when the water naturally returned to normal, we introduced the fish back in to the lake.”

Dozens of non-native catfish were also found at the site, which were removed and re-homed.
