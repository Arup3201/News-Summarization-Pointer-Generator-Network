The open enrollment period for federal Obamacare plans will begin more than a month later than it did last year, with this year's start date coming after the midterm elections.

In 2013 consumers could begin signing up for plans on Oct. 1. This year they were scheduled  to start their applications on Oct. 15. But the Obama administration announced late last year that the second enrollment period would instead begin on Nov. 15 - a full week and a half after the consequential federal elections taking place on Nov. 4.

Both the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have said politics aren't at play. The enrollment date was delayed this year to give insurers more time to calculate rates and consumers more time to familiarize themselves with healthcare plans available to them, they've said.

Still, the move has the added convenience of allowing insurers to keep next year's rates a secret until voters have already cast their ballots for or against Democrats who voted for or support the health care law.

At a news briefing last fall, then-White House Press Jay Carney confirmed the postponement of the fiscal year 2015 and denied that the timing of the midterm elections factored into the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services' decision.

'The fact is, we're doing it because it make sense for insurers to have as clear a sense of the pool of consumers they gain in the market this year, before setting rates for next year,' the White House spokesman said.

CMS is the division of HHS that is responsible for implementing the health care law. 

An HHS official told Fox News at the time of the announcement that the purpose of the revised enrollment schedule was to give insurers 'the benefit of more time to evaluate their experiences during the 2014 plan year,' particularly after glitches with healthcare.gov caused numerous delays in the first enrollment period.

The government was supposed to cut consumers off on March 31 but ended up allowing them to sign up for coverage well into April. 

Fox's HHS source tried to frame the fall 2014 delay as 'good news for consumers' because they 'will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling.' 

However, Republicans are crying foul. The way they see it, the administration is purposefully trying keep the true costs of Obamacare from Americans until after November's congressional elections.

'If premiums go through the roof in the first year of Obamacare, no one will know about it until after the election,' Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said when CMS announced the postponement a year ago. 

The federal health care site has been under construction since the last open enrollment period for Obamacare ended in April.

Among the changes to the site is a simplified application that only asks customers 16 pages of questions instead of 76.

Glitches that caused the site to crash during peak traffic times have also been resolved, HHS told the Associated Press, and more than 125,000 people will be able to access the site at the same time.

The next open enrollment period begins on Nov. 15. and ends Feb. 15.

The Congressional Budget Office expects roughly 13 million Americans to sign up for Obamacare in fiscal year 2015, up from the eight million people who signed up last year.

In a statement released last Friday Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips claimed, 'the President sold ObamaCare to the American people on the false promise that it would make health care more accessible and more affordable for those who needed it most.

'Sadly, ObamaCare has actually put affordable health care even further out of reach for millions of Americans,' the conservative non-profit head claimed.The administration’s decision to withhold the costs of this law until after Election Day is just more proof that ObamaCare is a bad deal for Americans.' 

Obamacare continues to be unpopular with many Americans, and Democrats should be concerned, if they already are not, that Americans facing sticker shock on their health care plans could take their anger out at the ballot box.

Alaska, Iowa and Louisiana are all set to see premium hikes next year, and the Democratic Senators representing all three states are in danger of being knocked off by their Republican challengers.

In Alaska two insurers, Premera Blue Cross and Moda Health, are planning double-digit rate increases, according to the Washington Times.

The Times reports that 88 percent of Alaskans won't be dramatically effected by the rate hike because they qualify for government subsidies.

However that hasn't stopped the Republican candidate in the state's senate race, Dan Sullivan, from using the news as a cudgel against incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat who voted for Obamacare.

'Did you lose your coverage due to ObamaCare? Are your premiums set to skyrocket? Follow the link to share your ObamaCare story and stand up to the elected leaders in D.C. who sold Alaskans out,' Sullivan said in a Facebook post on Sept. 12.

While Obamacare has taken a backseat to other prominent issues in this year's elections such as immigration, jobs and the economy and the war against the Islamic State, Republican Senate candidates in Iowa and Louisiana have also made the health care reform law a central issue in their campaigns.

CMS didn't immediately reply to a request for comment from MailOnline on Republican's accusations that the 2015 enrollment period was pushed back for political reasons.
