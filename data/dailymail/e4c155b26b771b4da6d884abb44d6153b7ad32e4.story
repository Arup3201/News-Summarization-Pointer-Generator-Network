A special needs student in Michigan is facing charges of malicious destruction of police property and resisting and obstructing - and he's only eight-years-old.

Edward Hart attends the Hillside Learning and Behavior Center in Allegan, where he is known to have anger management issues.

On March 19 he ran away from the school - which he has had done before - with teachers and the principal chasing after him.

They caught up with Hart quite from the school at a party store.

Edward Hart, 8, a special needs student in Allegan, Michigan, is facing charges of malicious destruction of police property and resisting and obstructing following a run-in with an officer

Edward ran away from his special needs school in Allegan on March 19, which is when the incident with the police occurred

When a teacher finally caught up to Edward at this party store, some distance from the school, they called police for assistance

Police were called to help, and according to the their report, school staff requested the officer drive Edward back to the school.

This is when the real trouble started.

When he was asked his name, Edward is said to have cursed at the officer and assaulted him.

The report also said that, once in the back of the police car, Edward broke off a rear camera.

The officer then decided to charge him.

'I don't even think he did anything wrong in this case. - he's special needs,' Edwards stepfather, Robert Bluhm, told Fox 43.

'He's ran away from the school before . . . but he's never made it as far as he did this time.

'He has special needs. He has anger issues. They know this, and they're going to throw him in the back of a cop car all by himself?'

'If they had him under control, why didn't they ride with him in the back of this cop car?

Not impressed: Edward's stepfather, Robert Bluhm, said the situation could have been handled different and that an eight-year-old she not be up for criminal charges

'So this incident would have never took place?'

Mr Bluhm said they had 'majorly' disciplined Edward over the incident, banning him from TV for a week, making him spend a day in a timeout chair and taking away his Nintendo DS.

As their own punishment, Allegan Police Department are asking for a $50 payment to repair the camera.

Mr Buhm said they intend to paw the Nintendo DS to pay for it.

Police Chief Rick Hoyer told Fox43 said he does not agree with the prosecutor's office decision to charge the eight-year-old in a criminal sense.
