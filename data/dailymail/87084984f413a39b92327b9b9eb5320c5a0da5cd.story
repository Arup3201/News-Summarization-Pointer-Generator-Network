A young boy battling terminal cancer got the thrill of a lifetime this weekend when he scored a touchdown in his first ever football game.

Liam Myrick, a six-year-old from Houston, Missouri, who is fighting stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, got a chance to play for the Mountain Grove Mighty Mite football team, and serve as an honorary team captain for the day.

Even better, with the help of his new teammates, he also managed to run in a touchdown from 15-yards out.

Unfortunately, the excitement was short lived, as moments later the young boy was forced to take medication for his pain.  

Since being diagnosed at the age of 3, Liam has undergone 14 rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, two bone marrow transplants, 20 rounds of radiation and nine major surgeries his mother, Shawna Myrick, told FoxNews.com.

'His cancer is growing again and there’s not a lot that they can do because he has fluid around his heart, and the one kidney he has left is starting to fail as well as his live,' she added.

The Myrick family says they got a call from Mighty Mite coach Jerry Elliot last week, saying the team would like to honor Liam at a game.

Horrible news: Doctors have said that due to Liam's low energy levels the young boy does not have much time left 

Helping hand: Liam's parents have set up a page where people can donate to their son's treatment

He ran through the banner with the other boys at the start of the game, participated in the coin toss, and then scored his big touchdown.

'It’s probably one of the coolest memories we’ve had,' Shawna said. 

Doctors have told the family that due to Liam's low energy levels, they don't think he has much time left. 

The family has set up a Facebook page where people can donate to help offset the cost of Liam's treatments and care here.
