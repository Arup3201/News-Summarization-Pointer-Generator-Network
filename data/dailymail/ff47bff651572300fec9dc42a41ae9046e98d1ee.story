Dozens of houses were destroyed and children were crushed to death when their school building collapsed after a devastating earthquake hit the central Philippines this morning.

At least 13 people were killed, and 29 remain missing, after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck in a narrow strait just off Negros Island. A tsunami alert was issued after the disaster, but later lifted.

Thousands of residents were trapped in their homes as a landslide hit the city of Guihulngan in Negros Oriental province.

City Mayor Ernesto Reyes said: 'Their situation is bad because if you are covered by landslide for one hour, two hours, how can you breathe? But we just hope for the best, that there are still survivors.' He said rescuers were using picks and shovels to dig for survivors.

Reyes said at least 10 people were confirmed dead in his city, including students at a college and an elementary school and others in a market that collapsed. About 100 were injured.

The quake, which hit at 11.49am (0349 GMT), triggered another landslide in the mountain village of Solongon in La Libertad town, also in Negros Oriental.

An unknown number of people were trapped, said La Libertad police chief inspector Eric Arrol Besario, who added: 'We're now getting shovels and chain saws to start a rescue because there were people trapped inside. Some of them were yelling for help earlier.'

Three key bridges in the town suffered cracks and were no longer passable, he said. Philippine seismologists briefly issued a tsunami alert for the central islands.

Five bamboo and wooden cottages were washed out from a beach resort in La Libertad by huge waves, but there were no reports of injuries, said police Superintendent Ernesto Tagle.

Elsewhere along the coast, people rushed out of schools, malls and offices. The epicenter was closest to Tayasan, a coastal town of about 32,000 people flanked by mountains in Negros Oriental province.

Two died there, including a child when a concrete fence of a house collapsed, said Benito Ramos, head of the Office of Civil Defence.

Another child was killed in a church when a wall collapsed during a funeral in Negros Oriental's Jimalalud town, Mayor Reynaldo Tuanda said.

Tayasan police officer Alfred Vicente Silvosa said aftershocks were preventing people from returning to their homes. Seismologists recorded nearly 45 aftershocks.

Silvosa said: 'We are outside, at the town plaza. We cannot inspect buildings yet because it's dangerous.

'I felt the building shaking, so I rushed out of the building. Our computers, shelves, plates, the cupboards, water dispenser all fell.'

A three-story office building also collapsed in La Libertad, but occupants managed to run out.

Negros Oriental police chief Edward Carranza said the temblor damaged many houses in Guihulngan and he ordered his men to help displaced residents find shelter.

Officials in some areas suspended work and canceled classes. Power and telecommunications were knocked out in several places.

Carranza said police rushed out of his building when the quake struck and added: 'All my personnel ran out fearing our building would collapse.

'Now it's shaking again,' he said as an aftershock hit, 'My keychain is dancing.'

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centred 44 miles north of Dumaguete city on Negros and hit at a depth of 29 miles.

The area is about 400 miles southeast of the capital, Manila.
