Boston Mayor Marty Walsh admits that no one will find much joy as jury selection begins today in the trial of marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, but that the process is a necessary step for the city to find closure.

Projected to last for months, the trial 'is going to be a tough time' for families who 'are going to relive what happened on that horrific day,' he told reporters.

Still, 'the judicial process has to take place' for those same families to really heal, Walsh argued.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh admits that no one will find much joy as marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial gets underway, but that it was a necessary step for the city to find closure

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured in the double bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013. 

Among the dead was an 8-year-old boy.

Tsarnaev is accused of orchestrating the bombings with brother Tamerlan, using a pair of pressure cooker bombs. 

Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with the police three days later.

Tsarnaev was found hiding in the a dry-docked boat outside the town of Watertown, just six miles northwest of Boston's city limits. 

He's since entered a not guilty plea to each of the more than two dozen charges he's facing.  

Defense attorneys have pushed for a trial delay and change of venue but have had both requests denied by a federal judge

Walsh told ABC News that he didn't believe the trial would be enough for the victims to find closure, calling it instead a 'chapter in their life' they could close without having to 'worry about the court case, not worry about what evidence is being admitted and what evidence is not being admitted.'

Beyond telling journalists that he had faith in the city's citizens to be a fair jury, he wouldn't comment on the trial itself. 

Defense attorneys have pushed for a trial delay and change of venue but have had both requests denied by a federal judge. 

Because the damage caused by the bombings was so far-reaching throughout the community, and because of the case's high profile nature, Tsarnaev's attorneys argued that 'every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses.'
