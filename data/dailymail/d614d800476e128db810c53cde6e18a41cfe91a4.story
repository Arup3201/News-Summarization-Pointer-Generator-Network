Detroit police are investigating whether a mob attack on a white motorist who accidentally ran over a young black boy could be a hate crime, despite previously saying they had no evidence to suggest such an offense.

Grandfather Steve Utash,
54, was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in
 front of his truck on a busy street and got out to check on the young boy.

Police have arrested so far four suspects arrested in connection with the attack which saw about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said investigators were examining whether the attack should be treated as a hate crime.

Detroit Police spokesman Jennifer Moreno previously told MailOnline: 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime.

'We're widening the scope of our investigation,' Chief Craig told The Detroit News.

'Both
 our strategy and the prosecutor's strategy is widening, and those 
factors are being looked into very closely. I can't reveal some things 
about our investigation, but that (a hate crime classification) is 
definitely something we're considering.'

In
 Michigan, ethnic intimidation is a felony that carries a possible 
two-year prison sentence.

There are also federal hate crime laws.

His son Joseph Utash previously hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime.

'I
 think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s
 been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same 
company... they know he has money and they robbed him.

'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.'

Detroit police Sgt. Michael Woody said a 30-year-old man was arrested Sunday night and a 24-year-old on Monday afternoon.

That brings to four the number of people arrested in the assault of 54-year-old Steve Utash after the accident Wednesday.

Bruce
 Wimbush, Jr., 17, was charged Monday with assault with intent to commit
 murder and do great bodily harm, and faces arraignment Tuesday.

The fourth is a 16-year-old boy who hasn't been charged but was being held in a juvenile detention facility.

Authorities have five days to determine whether someone is charged as an adult.

Police initially said a group of at least six people descended on Utash, a tree-trimmer.

Woody
 said Monday that investigators are 'not trying to stick to one specific
 number' as they receive more tips and other information.

'We
 wouldn't have been able to get as far as we have' without help from the
 public, Woody said, though he added, 'We're not done yet. We're still 
very much at the beginning stages of this case.'

The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.'

A
 prominent black minister, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, had said 
Saturday that it was important for community members 'to prove that we 
equally deplore justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the
 victim is or of the one committing it.'

Prosecutor
 Kym Worthy said in a statement Monday that the case is 'unbelievably 
tragic,' but declined further comment 'because this investigation is 
continuing and widening.'

Security 
footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of 
shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed 
down by Utash's vehicle.

Utash, from suburban Roseville,
 immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from 
their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene.

Police quickly ruled the incident an accident.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained.

But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation.

'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit.

A
 web page launched to accept donations for Utash's medical bills had 
raised more than $120,000 by late Monday afternoon. He has no medical 
insurance.

The family have said they are grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world.

'Mr
 Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need, and, 
appallingly, was punished for doing so,' said state Rep. Brian Banks, a 
Harper Woods Democrat whose district includes the scene of the attack.

'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.'
