Police found a tall lamp lying on a bedroom floor and open suitcases containing folded clothes in the closet of a California home, according to court records unsealed Friday in the investigation that eventually led to the discovery of four dead family members in shallow desert graves.

The documents offer the most detailed look yet of the disheveled condition of the family's house in Fallbrook when investigators arrived in February 2010 while searching for Joseph McStay, then 40, his wife Summer, 43, and their two sons, Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3.

Police also found two bowls of slightly spilled popcorn on a living room couch and a carton of raw eggs and bowl of microwave popcorn on a kitchen counter.

'In my opinion, a family does not just up and leave under the circumstances described above,' San Diego County Sheriff's Detective Troy DuGal wrote while seeking court approval for a more thorough search of the house and phone records.

He said he believed that some or all of the family members had been kidnapped or killed.

Among the dozens of items recovered from the house was an eviction notice from the McStay's previous residence in San Clemente.

The family's disappearance remained a mystery until their remains were found in November 2013 by an off-road vehicle rider near Victorville in the desert northeast of Los Angeles.

Charles 'Chase' Merritt, who knew the family through the water-fountain business of Joseph McStay, was arrested last November and pleaded not guilty to murder.

News organizations including The Associated Press asked judges in San Diego and San Bernardino to unseal search warrants in the case.

San Diego Superior Court Judge Runston Maino unsealed all the warrants obtained by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which oversaw the investigation until turning it over to the FBI in April 2013.

At a brief hearing, the judge dismissed objections of Merritt's attorney, Robert Ponce, who argued that publicity surrounding release of the documents might taint a jury, and that a decision should be delayed until his client could appear personally.

San Bernardino Superior Court Judge Michael Smith will consider next Friday whether to unseal search warrants obtained by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Those documents, written within a year of Merritt's arrest, are more likely to reveal why investigators decided McStay's former business associate is a suspect.

Sean Daugherty, a San Bernardino County deputy district attorney, didn't object to releasing the San Diego search warrants but has indicated he will oppose unsealing documents from later stages of the investigation in San Bernardino.

An ex-convict was charged last November with four counts of murder in the slayings of a couple and their two young sons whose skeletal remains were found buried last year in the California desert, police and prosecutors said.

The suspect, Charles 'Chase' Merritt, 57, was described by police as a former business associate of the father, Joseph McStay, who was reported missing with his wife and two boys in February 2010 from the family's Southern California home.

Merritt, arrested without incident in Los Angeles, is believed to have acted alone, though investigators are keeping mum about any motives for the killings, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon.

Charles Merritt, a business associate of Joseph's, was arrested in the murders of the family of four, including two young boys, whose disappearance from their San Diego County home in 2010 was a mystery until their remains were discovered in graves in the California desert last year

The four victims - McStay, 40, his wife, Summer, 43, and their two sons, 4-year-old Gianni and 3-year-old Joseph Jr. - died of blunt-force trauma, the sheriff said. According to police, they were killed inside their home in the San Diego County community of Fallbrook on Feb. 4, 2010.

San Bernardino County authorities took over the investigation in November 2013 after their remains were unearthed near Victorville, about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The shallow graves were located when a motorcyclist reported finding what he thought were human bones in the desert.

Merritt faces the death penalty if convicted, county prosecutor Michael Ramos said, declaring, 'This is a cold and callous murder of an entire family.'

The lead homicide detective, Sergeant Chris Fisher, told a news conference that Merritt had at least two prior felony convictions and served two state prison terms.

Fisher said McStay and Merritt each had owned his own decorative-fountain business and that McStay had asked Merritt 'to make some custom waterfalls.'

'They started working together, became friends (and) that's how their relationship started,' Fisher said. He added that the two men had a meeting at a restaurant the day of the slayings.

But he revealed nothing of what detectives knew of that encounter or what evidence led investigators to Merritt.

McStay's mother, Susan Blake, told reporters her son had loaned Merritt 'quite a bit of money,' but she did not elaborate.
