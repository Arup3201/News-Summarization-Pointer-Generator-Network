The Queen wants a new gardener to maintain her Buckingham Palace lawns to 'the highest standards', encourage wildlife and recycle waste at her home - all for less than £300 a week.

The successful green-fingered candidate for the £14,950-a-year job must also be proficient in 'good organic horticultural practices' when tending the Palace's shrub, herbaceous and rose borders.

The gardener will also carry out green waste recycling duties.

Buckingham Palace boasts more than 40 acres of garden including 350 different species of flower, 200 trees and a lake

Any applicant must also be an early riser, as the 40-hour-a-week job starts at 7.30am and be prepared to work overtime depending on the season.

The job details, published on the Royal website, make it clear that the gardener must be green aware.

Candidates must 'have a keen interest in conservation and organic practices'.

Duties include leaf clearing without the use of machinery to 'encourage the development of the wildlife'.

The advert also reads: 'To carry out green waste recycling duties including transporting the Royal Mews skips to allotment sites.

'Have substantial practical horticultural experience including herbaceous and rose practices'.

The Royal gardens feature a range of environmentally friendly initiatives.

Mark Lane, gardens manager at Buckingham Palace, said on the Royal Household's website: 'At Buckingham Palace, 99% of green waste is recycled on site. Green waste includes grass cuttings, twigs, branches and "arisings" (soiled straw from the stables in the Royal Mews).

More than 800 people work at Buckingham Palace.

The Royal residence is equipped with 188 bedrooms for staff who live or stay at the Palace.

As well as the expected jobs of housekeeping, horticulture, catering and administration, the Palace also employs a fendersmith, to clean and repair metal fenders in front of fireplaces.

Two full-time horological conservators are employed to wind up Buckingham Palace's 350 clocks and watches every week and keep them in working order.

A flag serjeant has the role of raising and lowering the correct flag as the Queen arrives at or departs from the Palace.

Cleaners are employed to maintain the 760 windows within the Palace. Each window is cleaned every six weeks.

'Waste is also brought in from Kensington Palace, Marlborough House and St James’s Palace grounds. This is put through a shredder so that bacteria can operate more quickly on smaller pieces of material.

'The waste is regularly turned until it has rotted sufficiently to be used as mulch. We then use this when preparing new flower beds. The mulch protects plants from heat and cold, retains water, suppresses weed germination and prevents soil from being washed away in the rain.'

Buckingham Palace's garden stretches out over 40 acres and features a lake, a helicopter landing area, a tennis court and is home to 30 different species of bird and 350 different wild flowers.

In 2009 an allotment was planted in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the first time since the Second World War. The 30 feet by 24 feet plot is managed organically and the produce is used by the Palace kitchens.

Eco-conscious gardeners also leave larger pieces of wood stacked around the Palace grounds to provide habitats for a variety of flora and fauna, including beetles, spiders and fungi.

Tree stumps are not removed, but are left to rot away naturally, providing a perfect environment for insects to lay their eggs and hatch their larvae in. Dead trees are also left alone, with one such tree at the bottom of the Rose Garden currently providing a habitat for a family of Woodpeckers.

'The use of pesticides is kept to a minimum, and the aim is that eventually they will be phased out completely', said Mr Lane.

'Whereas weed killer was once used on the paths of the Buckingham Palace grounds, now a weed burning machine is used instead. This breaks up the cells of living plants so that they explode through heat, meaning that there is no need for chemicals which could potentially be harmful to wildlife.'

Sustainable plant life is encouraged, with a long grass policy currently in use over approximately 10% of the Buckingham Palace garden area.

Among the wildflowers found in the garden are Creeping Buttercup and Herb Robert.

In addition, the stretch of ground around the edge of the lake is cut on a rotational basis every four years to allow flora and fauna to prosper uninterrupted.

As well as sustaining existing flora and fauna, new wildlife and plant life is also encouraged. Over the last 10 years, many more seed bearing plants have been introduced into the garden; these encourage a wealth of bird life to come into the Palace grounds to feed during the winter months.

More native plants have also been brought in. Seed bearing plants include a wide variety of Cotoneaster and Rowans, and natives have included the Aspen and female Black Poplar.

Mr Lane added: 'We also ensure that the machinery which is used for the upkeep of the gardens is environmentally sound. The weed burning machine runs off the same liquid petroleum gas supply which is used for The Duke of Edinburgh’s taxi. Biodegradable diesel, lubricants and oils are used in lawn mowers and other pieces of machinery.'

The new gardener must hold a formal qualification in horticulture and have 'have a keen interest in conservation and organic practices.'
