Locked up: Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years of 'compulsory labour' by North Korea for unspecified crimes against the state

An American has been sentenced to 15 years hard labour in North Korea after the hardline Communist regime accused him of trying to overthrow the state.

Kenneth Bae, a Washington state man 
described by friends as a devout Christian and a tour operator, is at 
least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009.

The others eventually were deported or
released without serving out their terms, some after trips to Pyongyang
by prominent Americans, including former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton 
and Jimmy Carter.

With U.S.-North Korean ties worsening 
since a long-range rocket test more than a year ago, Pyongyang is 
fishing for another visit, said Ahn Chan-il, head of the World Institute
for North Korea Studies think tank in South Korea.

'North Korea is using Bae as bait to 
make such a visit happen. An American bigwig visiting Pyongyang would 
also burnish Kim Jong Un's leadership profile,' added Mr Ahn.

Kim took power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in December 2011. He is believed to be just 29 years old.

North Korea has faced increasing 
criticism over its nuclear weapons ambitions. Disarmament talks 
including the Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia fell 
apart in 2009.

Several rounds of U.N. sanctions have 
not encouraged the North to give up its small cache of nuclear devices, 
which Pyongyang says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself 
from a hostile Washington.

Pyongyang's tone has softened somewhat
recently, following weeks of violent rhetoric, including threats of 
nuclear war and missile strikes.

There have been tentative signs of 
interest in diplomacy after a major source of North Korean outrage - the
annual U.S.-South Korean military drills - ended this week.

In Washington, the U.S. State 
Department said it was working with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang to 
confirm the report of Mr Bae's sentencing.

The U.S. lacks formal diplomatic ties 
with North Korea and relies on Sweden for diplomatic matters involving 
U.S. citizens there.

Mr Bae's trial on charges of 
'committing hostile acts' against North Korea took place in the Supreme 
Court on Tuesday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.

North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA referred to Mr Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name.

He was arrested in early November in 
Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far north-east which 
borders China and Russia, state media said. The exact nature of his 
alleged crimes has not been revealed.

Friends and colleagues say Mr Bae was 
based in the Chinese border city of Dalian and travelled frequently to 
North Korea to feed orphans.

Mr Bae's mother in the U.S. did not answer calls seeking comment, the Associated Press reported.

There are parallels to a case in 2009.
After Pyongyang's launch of a long-range rocket and its second 
underground nuclear test that year, two American journalists, Laura Ling
and Euna Lee, were sentenced to 12 years of hard labour after sneaking 
across the border from China.

They later were pardoned on 
humanitarian grounds and released to Bill Clinton, who met with 
then-leader Kim Jong Il. U.S.-North Korea talks came later that year.

Jimmy Carter visited North Korea in 
2011 to negotiate the release of imprisoned American Aijalon Gomes, who 
had been sentenced to eight years of hard labour for crossing illegally 
into the North from China.

Korean American Eddie Jun was released
in 2011 after Robert King, the U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights,
travelled to Pyongyang.

Mr Jun had been detained for half a year over an 
unspecified crime.

Mr Jun and Mr Gomes are also devout 
Christians. While North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of 
religion, in practice only sanctioned services are tolerated by the 
government.

U.N. and U.S. officials accuse North 
Korea of treating opponents brutally. Foreign nationals have told 
varying stories about their detentions in North Korea.

Ms Ling and Ms Lee, the two 
journalists sentenced to hard labour in 2009, were kept in a guest house
instead of a labour camp due to medical concerns.

But Ali Lameda, a member of 
Venezuela's Communist Party and a poet invited to the North in 1966 to 
work as a Spanish translator, said that he was detained in a damp, 
filthy cell without trial the following year after facing espionage 
allegations that he denied.

He later spent six years in prison after a one-day trial, he said.
