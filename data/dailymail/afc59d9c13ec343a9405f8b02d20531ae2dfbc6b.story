Sprawled out on the track with a running shoe in hand, a topless Usain Bolt enjoys some well-earned rays after a tough training session.

The world's fastest man took advantage of a break in our miserable summer as the sun made a rare appearance today.

Stripped down to his shorts, he limbered up at Birmingham City University as he prepares to defend his 100m and 200m Olympic crowns.

Down to bare basics: Bolt will be making final preparations at the track this week before heading to the Olympic Stadium on Thursday for the opening ceremony

He will be staying with the Jamaican team in the second city until Thursday when he will travel to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford for the opening ceremony.

Bolt has been sleeping in a custom-made orthopaedic bed at his training camp to ensure he does not suffer further back problems which have disrupted his preparations for the Games.

He was also forced to withdrew from last week's Grand Prix in Monaco with a hamstring problem sustained during his defeat to compatriot and 2012 title contender, Yohan Blake, in June.

The
university have been planning for this period for five years now and 
have pulled out the stops to make the Jamaican team as comfortable as 
possible pre-Games.

And it seems their efforts to be impeccable hosts will be rewarded with some longed-for sunshine in the days to come.

Forecasters say it is finally time to dig out the T-shirts because from 
tomorrow the downpours are predicted to clear and sunshine is finally on
the way.

England and Wales will at last bask in sunny and dry weather all weekend and into next week, they said.

Temperatures will reach 26C (80F) for the start of the school holidays, and bring a welcome boost to UK seaside destinations.

But
before the weekend - and sunshine - begins in earnest parts of the 
country were warned of further downpours after more overnight flooding 
in Essex.

Severe weather warnings were even issued for Essex after the heavy rain.

The Met Office said the mercury will 
peak at 24C (77F) on Sunday and 26C (80F) on Monday without a rain cloud
in sight, raising the possibility of a sunny start to the Olympics next
Friday.

Tuesday could be warmer still for London and the Olympic Stadium.

It will be welcome news for the 
country, which has so far seen a dismal 45.5 hours of sunshine this 
month – a quarter of the 174.3 average, figures revealed yesterday. It 
is a gloomy contrast to July 1911, when the UK basked in an astonishing 
383.9 hours.

Yesterday saw heavy downpours restricted mainly to south east England, with a dry day for many places.

The flooding on the A130/A127 junction was up to a metre deep in parts

Torrential storms on Wednesday night 
in East Anglia saw city centre streets deluged in Norwich, and several 
traffic collisions blamed on the blinding rain.

Up to 20mm – a week’s worth of rain – 
was predicted to hit Kent and Essex last night, but only scattered 
showers were reported elsewhere.

Today will be cloudy and overcast for 
many areas, with rain showers possible for most places in the morning 
and early afternoon but no heavy downpours expected.

But the good news is that from 
tomorrow, it will be dry and sunny, with the summery spell lasting up 
until at least Tuesday if not longer, according to forecasters.

Dan 
Williams at the Met Office said the now infamous jet stream – the 
high-altitude belt of wind blamed for the recent  bad weather – is on 
the move and by tomorrow will be back in its normal position for this 
time of year.

He said: ‘It’s going to be a lot 
better this weekend, lasting right up until Tuesday, with dry and sunny 
weather for most of England and Wales and pretty decent temperatures.

‘Scotland and Northern Ireland will 
see wetter and windier conditions this weekend because the jet stream 
moving north to where it should be at this time of year, and taking the 
weather with it.

‘It’s been moving for the last couple of days but is almost in its normal position

'However, the long-overdue summer 
weather is not likely to quite reach the heights it did at the end of 
May, when the mercury peaked at 28.4C (83.1F) in Cornwall on May 26

But it does bring to an end the 
wettest three months on record from April to June. Britain was deluged 
for weeks, with 3,000 homes and business flooded and people swept to 
their deaths.

The flood and storm damage in June 
alone is estimated to have cost insurers £500million, according to the 
Association of British Insurers.

Already this month, the rainfall has hit 71.8mm – above the typical 69.6mm July average.

The warm weather should hold on for 
long enough to give a fine day next Friday. After this, forecasters said
it is too early to know for sure whether the sun will stay for the 
Olympics.

When London last hosted the Games, in 1948, the country basked in temperatures as high as 33C (91F).
