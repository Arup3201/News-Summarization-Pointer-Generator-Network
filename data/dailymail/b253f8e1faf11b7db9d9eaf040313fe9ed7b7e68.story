This is the shocking moment a trio are caught on camera viciously attacking a restaurant customer, while one of them swings wildly at the man with a machete.

The group brutally attacked the lone victim inside U.S. Chicken in Paterson, New Jersey, as one of the men wielded the large blade and slashed at the helpless customer.

At the end of the attack the three men flee from the restaurant, as the bloodied man lies sprawled across the restaurant.

The barbaric attack starts when the victim scraps with bare-chested man thought to be Johel Gomez, 20, just inside the restaurant

Brutal: Seconds later Gomez is allegedly joined by machete-wielding Tyree Seegers and Omar Villota, who savagely attack the helpless customer

Wild: Seegers swings savagely at the man, who by now is off camera as the brutal assaults continues

And to complete the shocking attack, as the group leave one of the men lands a vicious kick on the victim's head.

Police say the attack, as well as another assault carried out on a different customer minutes earlier, were both unprovoked.

Officers believe Tyree Seegers, 22, hacked at the second man 14 times with a machete during the attack on September 10.

His attack was so wild that at one point he chops into accomplice Omar Villota, 22, who is allegedly continually pistol-whipping the victim.

Helpless: The customer is apparently beaten to the floor, while a man thought to be Seegers (in white) continues to slash wildly at him with a machete in his right hand

The beating eventually comes to an end when the two men leave, but not before Gomez allegedly delivers a brutal kick to his head as he lies prone on the floor

It is thought Seegers almost accidentally severed Villota's right arm while savagely slashing at the intended victim.

The third man, Johel Gomez, 20, is allegedly seen on the video repeatedly punching the customer.

Officers eventually tracked down the three men by following the blood trail left by Villota.

Gomez, Seegers and Villota have all been arrested. Seegers was picked up early on Wednesday morning after turning himself in.

Police last week revealed they have arrested Tyree Seegers, Omar Villota, Johel Gomez in connection with the machete attack

Caught: The trio were eventually tracked down from blood trails when they left the U.S. Chicken restaurant in Paterson, New Jersey

Amazingly, despite being subjected to the vicious assault, the victim was not seriously hurt, according to police.

Paterson Police Capt. Heriberto Rodriguez, said: 'Heâ€™s doing alright. He was banged up... nothing life threatening, thank God.'

Police say the only reason the customer avoided more serious injury was because Seegers was so wayward with the machete.

Rodriguez added: 'The one time he swung it straight and effectively, he hit his own counterpart, his owns friend.'

Police are still seeking the first victim and want him to come forward.
