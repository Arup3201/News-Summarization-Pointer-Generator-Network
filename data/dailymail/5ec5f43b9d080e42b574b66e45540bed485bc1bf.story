A parka that Kohl's described as having 'faux fur' trim was found to have real fur from raccoon dogs.

The Humane Society issued a consumer warning Tuesday after purchasing the men's R&O Hooded Parka on the retailer's website and conducting a test.

'Kohl’s department store has been telling customers it has its act together when it comes to distinguishing between real and fake fur, but, according to our latest investigation, it’s violating a federal law by selling real raccoon dog fur advertised as “faux,"' Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle wrote in a blog post on the organization's website.

PJ Smith, the Humane Society's Corporate Outreach Manager, told USA Today that the coat was sent to a lab that determined with 'a great degree of certainty that it was this particular species.'

'Raccoon dog fur is the species we'd consider the most misrepresented,' Mr Smith added.

He noted that the animal, which is indigenous to Asia, is in the same family as the domestic dog, fox and wolf.

Kohl's subsequently issued an apology and removed the parka from its website.

'Kohl’s standard vendor terms require that all merchandise must be free of any real animal fur unless expressly authorized in writing by Kohl’s. No such authorization was given here,' the store said in a statement.

'Once aware that the product was made with real fur, Kohl’s immediately removed the product from our website.The parkas in question were sold online only and were not exclusive to Kohl’s. Kohl’s has never held these items in our inventories, as they are directly shipped from the vendor to customers. Fewer than 100 of these parkas have been purchased through Kohl’s.'

Kohl's also said that it would allow returns for customers who bought the parka under the impression that it was made using fake fur.

'We apologize to our customers who would not have otherwise purchased these parkas. Kohl’s will honor returns, no questions asked, for any customers who no longer wish to keep them.'

According to the Humane Society's website, raccoon dogs are animals 'who in the wild seem to enjoy having a mate or friend close by.'

'These social animals live in pairs or small groups, and the males are helpful fathers, bringing food to their pregnant mate and helping to raise the young. Raccoon dogs suffer and die for their fur in intensive confinement operations in China and Finland, and their fur has been widely misrepresented as fake fur or as a different species.' 

This isn't the first time the Humane Society has accused Kohl's of misrepresenting real fur as fake.

In December 2013, the organization warned customers that accessories described as having faux fur lining were made with rabbit fur.

In a statement to MailOnline, PETA said: 'Companies like Kohl’s have a responsibility to ensure that they are not misleading customers who don’t want to support animals being bludgeoned, electrocuted, or skinned alive for their fur. PETA’s advice is that if there’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux, it’s best just to avoid it altogether.'
