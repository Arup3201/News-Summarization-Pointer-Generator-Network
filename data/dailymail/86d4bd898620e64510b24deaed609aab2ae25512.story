When Matthais Schlitte was 16 he wandered into a bar and  discovered that he was pretty good at arm-wrestling, due to his super human arm.

Over the past decade, Schlitte has travelled the world as a professional arm wrestler, honing his highly developed limb.

The 27-year-old German's arm measures 46cm around the forearm and has propelled him to eight national championships as well as 14 on an international level.

He has even beaten a specially designed arm-wrestling robot.

Schlitte's right forearm dwarfs his 'normal' left arm.

He said: '‘Many people’s first association with arm wrestling is a beer-soaked bar-table and drunken sailors – which is completely wrong.’

Of how he began his career, he explains: ‘In 2004, a little bar in Haldensleben was looking for the strongest arm wrestler in the region – my first tournament and the beginning of my career.

‘Without any knowledge or practise I competed in the amateur-class up to 90kg – being only 16 years old with a weight of 65kg.

‘At first, older and more experienced fighters smiled at me for being so light-weighted, but after winning the contest the opinions changed immediately.’
