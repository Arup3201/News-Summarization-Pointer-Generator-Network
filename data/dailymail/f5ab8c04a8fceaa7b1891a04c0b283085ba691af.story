A trainee pilot and an instructor had a dramatic escape when their plane crash-landed at an air base.

The two-person Tucano trainer crashed on its approach to the runway when its undercarriage failed to come down.

Amazingly both men walked away unhurt but the turbo-prop Tucano, which is driven by a propellor powered by a jet engine, suffered serious damage and came to rest on grass after travelling down the runway.

The runway was closed after the incident and an investigation has been launched into the crash, which happened at 10.20am at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire.

An airbase statement said the Tucano was on 'a routine training flight,' but it was too early to confirm details of the damage or the cause of the crash.

RAF Linton-on-Ouse operates a fleet of Tucano TMk1 aircraft, most of which are thought to be at least 20 years old.

It is the home of No1 Flying Training School, the oldest in the world, and 72 Squadron, which trains basic fast jetpilots for the RAF and Royal Navy.

Flt Lt Dave Williams, of Linton-on-Ouse, could not say when the runway would reopen following the incident, or if training would be halted and the Tucano fleet grounded until a full investigation had taken place.
