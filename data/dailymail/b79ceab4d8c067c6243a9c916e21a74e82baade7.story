A University dropout who got a grade D in his GCSE English exam has become only the second Briton to win the world Scrabble championship.

Craig Beevers, who said he has barely ever read a book, won the title with the word 'talaq', a Muslim form of divorce. 

The word netted him 42 points and gave him an unassailable lead in his final game at the ExCeL Centre in London.

Mr Beevers, 33, from Guisborough, near Middlesbrough, is the first Briton to win the world title since 1993. He competed against 100 players from 25 nations over five days to win the title and £3,000 in prize money.

The former Sheffield University mathematics undergraduate, who has been playing Scrabble since he was six, said: 'I am absolutely thrilled to have won – it was a closely fought championship.'

Other words he used included 'ventrous', meaning adventurous, scoring 65; 'gleet', meaning inflammation of the urethra, scoring 24; and 'diorite', meaning igneous rock, scoring 69.

Mr Beevers, who has committed up to 100,000 words to memory, had previously said: 'Finding words is a very mathematical skill. Most scrabble players don't learn what the words actually mean. 

'They try to learn whether it's a verb or a noun - whether it can take an S or a D. I feel like I've only really scratched the surface of what I'm capable of.'
