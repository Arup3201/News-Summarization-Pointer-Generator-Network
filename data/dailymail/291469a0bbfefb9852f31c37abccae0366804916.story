Anything that TT Games touches turns to blocks of gold. Take LEGO: The Lord of the Rings, a wonderful, faithful adventure that catered to both fans and newcomers alike.

Or LEGO Batman 2, adding a dash of comical cheek to one of the world's favourite caped crusaders.

And thankfully, on watching LEGO Marvel Super Heroes in action, TT Games look to have built  another blockbuster.

Built to last: Iron Man can shoot his blasters at foes and also use them to fly around levels

The game starts with the Silver Surfer being knocked out of the sky on his way to Galactus. His surfboard shatters and Nick Fury calls on the Marvel heroes to stop these immensly powerful 'Cosmic Bricks' falling into the wrong hands.

As expected, each hero has their own superpowers. Spiderman can create webs to swing on, Hulk can use his strength to smash and throw objects (and also turn into Bruce Banner), while Iron Man can punch and use his blasters to fly and attack from the air.

To break up the action, there are also some quick-time events. One particular highlight saw the Hulk having a 'punch-off' with a baddie - the player having to hammer the correct buttons to keep the flurry of blows going.

The gameplay demo suggests that you can switch characters, which opens up some interesting boss battles.Taking on Sandman, for example, involved the Hulk smashing bricks into smaller pieces to let Spiderman create a water gun to defeat the sandy monstrosity.

Marvel-ous: The boss battle in the video demo saw the heroes take on Sandman (above), which required each  character to use their own special abilities

Squint your eyes and you'll mistake Marvel Super Heroes for a next-gen game. There's that trademark TT motion blur, which gives everything a Hollywood gloss, and the sheer amount of stuff going on initially looked beyond current-gen hardware.

Cutscenes, too, have been given just as much care and attention, featuring LEGO humour fans have come to know and love.

It's set for release on September 30.
