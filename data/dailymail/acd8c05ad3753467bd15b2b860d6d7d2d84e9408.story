Many women around the world dream of being able to eat whatever they want and have any weight they gain go straight to their cleavage.

But with the stereotypical perfect female body being both very slender yet with large breasts most women fight a constant battle between avoiding the snack aisle and bemoaning their shrinking assets.

However one confectionery maker in Japan aims to bring women the best of both worlds, creating 'F Cup' cookies that claim to enhance breast size.

Each cookie contains 50mg of Pueraria Mirifica, plant extract found in plant found in northern and north eastern Thailand

The makers say that eating just two a day will create a noticeable difference in breast size, and they have spread in popularity not only through Japan but other parts of Asia.

Subtly named ‘F cup cookies’ the biscuits contain 50mg of Pueraria Mirifica (a plant extract found in plant in northern and north eastern Thailand) extract per cookie.

The plant Pueraria Mirifica contains a molecule similar to oestrogen known as Miroestrol which mimics the biological activities of the hormone.

Human oestrogen plays an important role in breast development and determining their size, and the F cup Cookies claim that the Mirestrol in the biscuits will act in the same way on the body when eaten.

While eating boob-boosting cookies might sound great, there is no scientific evidence at all that Miroestrol has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten

However, while the idea of the only consequence of indulging in sweet treats being a larger cup size might sound appealing, there is no scientific evidence at all that Miroestrol has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten.

It also has been claimed – though in a similarly unproven manner – that Pueraria Mirifica extract can be taken to increase appetite, which, if true may well increase a person’s breast size through increased fat but is unlikely to be noticed as the weight gain will occur on the entire body.

Nutrition expert Ian Marber says: 'Phytoestrogens are in numerous foods and to date there is no research to show that ingestion changes breast size.

‘Even concentrated doses haven't been shown to do anything, although eating several biscuits can lead to weight gain with all that goes with it.’

However, while oestrogen does effect breast size, no evidence eating Pueraria Mirifica has any impact
