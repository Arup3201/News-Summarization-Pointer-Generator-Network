Arsenal have offered Thierry Henry the chance to take his first footsteps in coaching at the club's academy.

The Gunners legend, who is currently working as a pundit for Sky Sports, has started his coaching badges as he plots a future career in management.

And the North London giants have granted Henry access to the club's successful Hale End academy to work with the club's future talent.

The Frenchman has already taken coaching sessions with various age groups at the club's youth base.

Henry is working towards securing his UEFA 'A' and 'B' coaching qualifications - and his experience with Arsenal's youth teams will provide the 37-year-old with valuable hands-on training.

The former Arsenal striker has been tipped as a future Arsenal manager given his allegiances with the club.

However, Henry's time at Hale End is not viewed, at the moment, as the start of his path into the Emirates Stadium hotseat.
