Xavi has committed his future to Qatar side Al Sadd, and is due to sign a three-year playing contract worth £22million in Doha this week.

The Barcelona captain will also begin coaching the generation of players that Qatar hope will represent them at the 2022 World Cup by taking a position at the Aspire Academy.

The 35-year-old picked Qatar over the offer of a move to Manchester City’s New York City MLS franchise. The £7.5m a year deal includes an optional extra year and the player is understood to have made his decision after taking advice from another former Spain captain Raul.

The Barcelona star is likely to have featured in his final Clasico as he heads to Qatar at the end of the season 

Real Madrid legend Raul played for Al Sadd from 2012 to 2014 before leaving to join New York Cosmos last year.

The chance to begin taking his coaching badges while benefiting from one final massive pay-day are also believed to have convinced the veteran of 751 games with Barcelona.

Xavi has a contract at Barcelona until 2016 but now looks set to play his last ever game for the club either against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey cup final in the Nou Camp on May 30, or in the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6.

Xavi’s role at the Aspire Academy is a huge boost for their effort to bring through a bright generation of Qatar internationals. 

He will work alongside former Spanish goalkeeper Roberto Olabe and the project's director, fellow Spaniard, Ivan Bravo, as well as continuing his playing career.
