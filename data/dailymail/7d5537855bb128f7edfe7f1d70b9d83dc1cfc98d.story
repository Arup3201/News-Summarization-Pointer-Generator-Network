Many new mothers turn to the Internet to answer questions or concerns about life with their newborn.

Sleeping habits are, of course, top of the list of queries but general health worries and child development are also popular online search topics, according to a new study out today. 

The most common three questions googled by mothers are: 'How can I get my child to sleep more?', 'How to clear my baby's nose?' and 'How can I help a teething baby?'.

Two thirds of new mothers questioned in a parenting survey described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood

Almost two thirds of the mothers questioned described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood.

It also emerged that as many as 85 per cent of mothers felt they had no idea what they were doing after giving birth to their first child.

And almost three quarters described having a baby as the 'biggest shock of their life'.  

The study of 2,000 mothers found that 82 per cent felt constantly worried about their child. 

And to put their mind at ease during their pregnancy and in the weeks and months after giving birth three quarters admitted to regularly turning to Google for answers to any questions or worries they had.

Common questions include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'.

Common online searches include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'.

The list also included questions such as 'What is colic?', 'How and when to potty train my child?', and 'When should my child crawl or walk?'.

As well as googling answers to their questions, the study also found 26 per cent of mothers have asked friends for advice on Facebook, while another 12 per cent have turned to Twitter.

Just over half have browsed parenting sites for the answers they are looking for, with 19 per cent also posting their question on parenting forums.

Researchers found for some the questions start immediately, with more than one in ten turning to Google on the day they found they were expecting.

Another 17 per cent did so within a few days of a positive test result.

One in twenty even searched the internet to answer a question they had on the day they gave birth.

But 87 per cent of mothers found they worried less as time went on and they adjusted to becoming a mum.

And eight in ten spent less time googling things and worrying with second or third children.

A spokesperson for Cussons Mum&Me Voice of Mums, which commissioned the research, said: 'Becoming a mum is a massive life-changing event, and it's natural to feel unsure or apprehensive at times.

'The study results show that while mothers often feel like the only one in the world worrying about a particular thing, more often than not it's something really common that most mums will have experienced and asked for advice on.

'When you first bring your baby home, it can feel pretty daunting knowing you are responsible for this little person, who doesn't come with an instruction manual.

'This can be especially true when dealing with their first cold or illness.

'But every mum you know will have been there, so you don't need to feel alone about asking them for advice.'

As well as googling answers to their questions, the study also found 26 per cent of mothers have asked friends for advice on Facebook, while another 12 per cent have turned to Twitter
