The actor who plays Gordon on Sesame Street has been ordered to continue paying palimony to the mother of his four children after he made an unwritten promise to provide for her for the rest of her life.

Roscoe Orman, 71, split with Sharon Joiner-Orman, 61, in March 2010 after 39 years together and married another woman two years later. At that point he cut off the $3,600 in monthly support he had been paying her.

When her landlord threatened to evict her from the Montclair home they previously shared, Joiner-Orman sued Orman, claiming he vowed to support her for life after she sacrificed her own career so he could become a 'Sesame Street' fixture for nearly four decades.

Last month, Superior Court Judge Ned Rosenberg in Newark ruled in Joiner-Orman's favor, in what appears to be the first ruling of its kind, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported.

Rosenberg said Orman must continue paying palimony even though the unmarried couple had never agreed to anything in writing. A hearing next week will determine how much Orman owes.

'The court finds the plaintiff (Joiner) has fully performed her end of the bargain,' Rosenberg wrote, according to the newspaper.

'In addition, there is no way to qualify the value of the services plaintiff provided over the course of 39 years much less the value of foregone educational and work related opportunities. What is more, the defendant does not deny the agreement and even acknowledged the obligation by deeds and words.'

On the Sesame Street website, Orman's character Gordon is described as 'a strong male role model' who is married to Susan and father of Miles.

'Susan and Gordon have been happily married for many year, providing a good example of a successful and united family.'

But Orman left his real-life partner in 2010, moving out of their four-bedroom home. He continued paying Joiner-Orman $3,600 in monthly support payments, while encouraging her to move into a smaller place, Rosenberg wrote in his ruling.

Orman paid her other support, including $5,000 in legal fees in October 2012. But in late December 2012, he cut off support when he married, the ruling states.

Joiner-Ormanâ€™s attorney, Charles Cohen, says the couple, while unmarried, had made a lifelong commitment to one another.

'They were in all respects husband and wife,' Cohen said.

Orman even refered to Joiner-Orman as his wife in a memoir he dedicated to her called 'Sesame Street Dad: Evolution of an Actor.' 'To my wife, Sharon Joiner-Orman, thanks for providing this story and my life with true meaning,' he wrote.

But Orman's attorney, Thomas McDonough, said he would appeal the decision, claiming it 'violates the purpose and language' of a 2010 amendment to state law that requires palimony agreements be agreed in writing under the advice of attorneys.

Rosenberg's ruling is believed to be the first of its kind in New Jersey.

'Where it is found that an oral agreement was made, and one party has performed, the contract will be enforced if to do otherwise would work an inequity on the party who has performed,' the judge wrote.

Brian Schwartz of The New Jersey State Bar Association, which opposed the amendment when it was introduced, welcomed the ruling.

'To think that some amendment is going to nullify 39 years together, that does not seem fair' he said. 'It's not fair to the person who relied on that promise.'

Joiner-Orman has moved out of the Montclair home and is living with her daughter, her lawyer told the Star-Ledger.
