Changing views: A Church of England paper backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Justin Welby (pictured) has signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church

The Church of England yesterday signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church.

It said priests may 'devise accommodations’ for same-sex couples 'who seek to engage with the challenges of life responsibly’.

It suggests that public prayers which recognise gay relationships could be introduced in church services by sympathetic clergy.

Yesterday’s paper, backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Justin Welby and the leading bishops, does not change the CofE laws which say homosexual activity is sinful and ban priests from blessing gay relationships.

But it appeared to encourage same-sex couples, saying the Church must show a 'degree of flexibility’ over gay relationships, and adding: 'the Church does not treat questions of what is possible in hard circumstances or exceptional conditions as simply closed.’

The proposal will infuriate traditionalists and is likely to reignite the bitter conflict within the Church over same-sex relationships.

The document likened the case of same-sex relationships to the controversy a decade ago over the remarriage of divorcees.

This ended with divorcees officially allowed to have second weddings in church, if they can find a sympathetic priest, even though CofE doctrines say marriage is for life.

The new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the CofE and David Cameron’s Government over same-sex marriage.

Laws permitting men to marry men and women to marry women are likely to be on the statute book within months.

The Church, along with other major faith organisations, has protested that the Government has no power to change the principle that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The CofE has warned that the new law could lead to disestablishment, the severing of the 480-year-old link between the Church and the state.

One of the bishops who produced the document, the Bishop of Coventry the Right Reverend Christopher Cocksworth, said the paper did not mean that churches could stage public services of blessing for gay couples, which are banned by Church law. He said that priests might offer such couples 'attention, care and prayer’.

But campaigners for gay rights in the Church said the paper meant a green light for clergy who wish to give public recognition to gay relationships.

'Devising accommodations': In a foreword, Dr Welby said the paper has been published because 'it would be timely to produce a short summary of the Church of England's understanding of marriage'

Dr Giles Fraser, a former Canon of St Paul’s Cathedral who is now priest-in-charge of a South London church, said: 'You cannot escape what is down in this document in black and white.

'This is saying you can bless same-sex relationships as long as you don’t say what you are doing. It is a wink to people like me who want to go ahead.

'It is coded language which says do it, but don’t advertise.’

He suggested clergy might offer communion services in which a same-sex couple would be invited to the altar rail during the blessing at the end of the ceremony.

In a foreword, Dr Welby said the paper has been published because 'it would be timely to produce a short summary of the Church of England’s understanding of marriage.’

It restates the CofE’s position that marriage must be between a man and a woman, and adds that marriage is the ideal platform for bringing up children.

Tensions: The new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the CofE and David Cameron's Government over same-sex marriage

But the paper said 'in pastoral responses a degree of flexibility may be called for in finding ways to express the Church’s teaching practically.’ It warned that 'the meaning of such pastoral accommodations can be misunderstood’.

However, the paper said the Church can 'devise accommodations for specific conditions, bearing witness in special ways to the abiding importance of the norm.’

The bishops said that although marriage should be for life, the 2002 rules on remarriage for divorcees 'offer pastoral support to those who with great honesty and circumspection approach a further marriage.’

In another comparison, they said that Anglican churches in Africa baptise people even though they are living in polygamous relationships.

The Church, along with other Christian denominations which do not recognise same-sex marriage, will be banned from staging same-sex weddings under Mr Cameron’s same-sex marriage law.

But Church of England leaders - who are bound by law to offer marriage to any qualified couple who ask for it - fear they will be vulnerable to human rights court challenges when gay couples are turned away by churches.

Dr Cocksworth said clergy could offer same-sex couples the support of prayer. 'The form of prayer will depend upon the particular circumstances of the particular case,’ he said.

'But we are talking about that sort of pastoral care if you like, and prayer, rather than something which is more formal and more public. This is part of the private, the personal, compassionate attention that a priest would give to people. It is not about public, formal recognition.’
