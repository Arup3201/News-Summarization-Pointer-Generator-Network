The exterior of this abandoned aircraft hangar is unlikely to feature on any holiday postcards but appearances can be deceptive.

Inside the giant dome is a water park the size of eight football pitches, boasting its own beaches, lagoons and tropical rainforest.

Tropical Islands resort is housed within the largest free-standing hall in the world, which measures 66,000 square metres and is so tall the Statue of Liberty could fit inside it.

Unlikely location: The resort is housed in an old aircraft hangar near Berlin and doesn't look particularly tropical from the outside

Sunny all year round: Inside, the hangar is home to pools, beaches, balmy lagoons and the world's largest indoor rainforest

Blue skies thinking: The resort has even erected a fake blue sky complete with fluffy white clouds, though it will never rain inside the dome

Making a splash: Tropical Islands is home to Germany's highest water slide tower which stands at a vertigo-inducing 27 metres tall

The water park is located in Krausnick, near Berlin and claims to offer tourists all the elements of a tropical holiday destination in the middle of Europe. 

The huge hangar once housed Zeppelins but its owners went bankrupt in 1992 and the building fell into disrepair. It was transformed 10 years ago into an indoor paradise by a Malaysian company.

Inside, the temperature is always a pleasant 26C which means the attraction can host the world's largest indoor rainforest, along with pools, beaches and giant water slides.

Among them is Germany's highest water slide tower which stands at a vertigo-inducing 27 metres tall.

Up to 700 people an hour can zoom down a 21-metre undulating stainless steel slide before going on the 112-metre Crazy River steel tube slide and then reach a top speed of 70 kmph on the power turbo slide.

In a spin: The resort's multi-coloured slides tower over the dome and are one of the main attractions for families

Don't look up: Holidaymakers can pretend they are lounging on a tropical island, as long as they ignore the ugly grey dome above

The resort's indoor rainforest has a one-kilometre walkway and 50,000 plants, of which there are 600 different species.

The complex also offers bars, saunas, lagoons and grottos to entertain a capacity of 6,000 visitors, along with 522 beds in various rooms and lodges, and hundreds of tents.

There are 400 sunloungers to accommodate guests on the world's largest indoor beach and, although they won't be able to soak up real tropical rays, at least they can be sure that it will never rain.

In the Bali Lagoon pool, swimmers can enjoy water temperatures of 32C while they are surrounded by palm trees, Balinese huts and even a waterfall.

The park is also home to Europe's biggest tropical spa and sauna complex which is spread over 10,000 square metres.

The six different treatment areas are modelled on various cultural sites, including the Elephanta Temple, which is a scale model of the original temple in India, and the Angkor Wat Temple based on the world-famous temple complex in Cambodia.

Meanwhile, the Jungle Village sits on stilts five metres above the ground and houses a range of saunas and steam baths.  

Controlling the weather: The sun peeks through the dome's windows but it will never rain inside the tropical water park

However, other customers were not so satisfied.

Borszczuk wrote: 'Visited for one day during national holiday and the place was a bit overcrowded - forget about finding free sunbed, finding free spot on sand was quite hard too. In general, the place is great for kids. Adults will most likely find it OK but boring.' 

And Viswakumar A warned: 'The sauna area of the park has a nude dress code. So be prepared!'
