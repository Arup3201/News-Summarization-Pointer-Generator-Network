These spectacular images document the final red deer stag season of professional stalker Peter Fraser, who has employed traditional methods of deer stalking for 45 years.

He has served as head stalker for 43 years on the Invercauld Estate in Braemar, Scotland. The stalking season runs from July until October and he is set to retire in November.

His day-to-day work revolves around hunting and shooting wild red deer, an iconic Scottish species. He controls the numbers of deer for the health of the herd and the benefit of their habitat.

Deer stalking involves the stealthy pursuit of deer, typically with a high powered rifle fitted with a telescopic sight. It is necessary because carnivorous predators of adult deer have long been hunted to extinction 
in Britain.

The objective is to maintain a stable and 
healthy population of deer and involves careful planning. Injured or sick animals are targeted first, then barren or very old animals. If the population needs to be reduced, more females will be
 culled. If a population increase is required, only injured or sick 
animals will be culled.

Stalking is a hard life, involving going out in all weathers and stalkers are used by guests hunting the stags. As well as his work as a stalker, Mr Fraser is dedicated to all the wildlife on the estate and traps stoats, weasels and crows, as well as keeping fox numbers in check, to stop the land becoming overrun by vermin.

According to the Invercauld Estate website, the land has been owned by the Farquharson family for centuries and incorporates approximately 200 square miles of spectacular scenery.
