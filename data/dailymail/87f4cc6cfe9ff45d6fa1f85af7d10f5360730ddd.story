David Cameron must shoulder some of the blame for Mark Reckless's defection, after falling out with him over the issue of Europe

During the run-up to last week’s Ukip conference, Nigel Farage was spotted going into an elegant Georgian townhouse close to a former site of the Bedlam hospital, one of the first British mental institutions, where the gentry used to amuse themselves by laughing at the inmates.

Mark Reckless, a bespectacled 6ft 3in economist and barrister who became a Tory MP at the last election, arrived around the same time.

It was in the privacy of the £2 million house that they plotted their own modern-day public spectacle: the humiliation of David Cameron on the eve of the Tory Party conference.

The house is owned by Malcolm Pearson, who has a 12,000-acre estate in the west of Scotland, who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher shortly before she was bundled unceremoniously from office.

As Lord Pearson of Rannoch he was always on the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party. It was his membership of the Lords EU select committee, from 1992 to 1996, which led him to become a leading exponent of the case for the UK to leave the EU.

In 2004, in despair at the Tory stance on Europe, he recommended people voted Ukip in the European elections, and was swiftly punished by having the Tory whip removed. He joined Ukip three years later.

He made good use of his time on the Ukip side, becoming firm friends with Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, and the first Tory MP in the current Parliament to defect to Ukip. 

Carswell is a close friend of Reckless. They often met for drinks at Pearson’s home as they toyed with the idea of joining Ukip.

But while Carswell, an MP since 2005, is a popular figure on the Tory benches, the same is not true of Reckless, who is regarded as cold and aloof. 

Carswell is one of his few confidantes at Westminster. With the Clacton by-election looming on October 9, dozens of Tory MPs have discovered pressing alternative engagements when asked to go to the Essex seaside town to campaign against Carswell.

But there is real anger among Tory MPs about Reckless, not least because he was lying about his intentions only hours before his bombshell announcement.

So why did Reckless decide to jump?

The truth is David Cameron has much to answer for. His sometimes casual attitude to party management has repeatedly alienated some MPs. 

If any of them criticise him privately or publicly, they can find themselves sent to the political equivalent of Siberia.

In the run-up to last week's Ukip conference, Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless were spotted going into a £2million townhouse in London together

In the summer of 2013, Cameron led an away-day of Tory MPs in his Chipping Norton constituency in Oxfordshire. It was designed to foster team spirit and develop election-winning policies.

Unfortunately, by the end of the gathering, the Prime Minister’s already fractious relationship with Mark Reckless had disintegrated.

In a speech during that event, the PM stressed the importance of unity. Sarah Wollaston, the former GP who became MP for Totnes at the last election, interrupted to say her constituents admired her independent-minded stances on several issues. 

After the session ended, Cameron sought out Wollaston and said: ‘Well, Sarah, you have to understand that when you rebel you never change anything. You just make us look divided.’

Reckless, who was sitting next to Wollaston, intervened, reminding the PM the only reason Cameron cut Britain’s EU grant was because of a revolt in 2012 by Tory MPs. 

The PM snapped back, saying: ‘I would have cut that anyhow.’ A disagreement ensued, and Reckless’s draining ‘faith’ in the PM evaporated.

In June this year, Reckless – who studied PPE at Oxford and was privately educated at Marlborough College – was the first MP to be called to speak at a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee of MPs which was addressed by Cameron.

He challenged the Prime Minister over his promised renegotiation of powers from the EU ahead of a referendum in 2017 if the Tories win the General Election.

Cameron is said to have been dismissive of Reckless, who concluded that the promised renegotiation was a PR stunt. The Ukip timebomb which had started ticking away the previous year was by then on a very short fuse.

The first approach from Ukip to Reckless – a former economist who married Scottish solicitor Catriona Brown at Westminster Cathedral in 2011 – came from Stuart Wheeler, the spread-betting magnate who gave £5 million to the Tories in 2001 when they were committed to keeping the pound.

Lord Pearson was a former Tory MP, but defected to Ukip in 2007. He also led the party for a short time

Wheeler was thrown out of the Tories in 2009 when he gave £100,000 to Ukip, which he subsequently joined. 

He entertained Reckless twice at Serafino – an Italian restaurant a short walk from Wheeler’s home. It was after the Wheeler lunches that Reckless got to know Farage much better.

But the decisive factor in the defection of Reckless was Lord Pearson.

The founder of a London-based insurance brokers, which he sold for millions in the 1990s, Pearson owns a moor, a deer forest, and a £4 million 12,000-acre country estate in Rannoch in the Highlands. He has a share portfolio worth a reputed £2.5 million.

With his cut-glass accent, a legacy of his Eton education, Pearson, 72, looks and sounds like an archetypal Tory grandee.

He became the leader of Ukip after Farage stood down to fight a parliamentary seat at the 2010 election. One of his first acts was to withdraw candidates in elections against four prominent Tory Eurosceptic MPs. 

He forced the policy through in the teeth of bitter opposition from within Ukip’s ranks.

The candidates were Philip Davies, who was defending Shipley, which he won last time with a 10,000 majority, and Philip Hollobone in Kettering, which he held with a 9,000 majority.

And the other two candidates? Step forward Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. Pearson also flooded their constituencies with 50,000 Ukip leaflets, urging votes to support the Tory candidates.

All four enjoyed greater swings in their favour than in other constituencies.

Given that two of the four Tories he backed at the last election have since defected, Pearson admits: ‘I always thought it was the right thing to do.’

And what about the other two, Davies and Hollobone? ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he says. Which is exactly what he said about Carswell and Reckless.

How the Tories must regret the offer from Farage and Pearson to stand down every one of their candidates at the last general election if Mr Cameron would make an unequivocal declaration in favour of an EU referendum. 

Pearson made the offer in June 2009 to Lord Strathclyde, the then Tory leader in the House of Lords, who conveyed it to Cameron. The Tory leader rejected it out of hand.

Given the events of the weekend, no wonder Tory MPs and strategists are terrified another Ukip defector is about to lob a political hand grenade into the Conservative conference hall.
