A video of three Korean women dancing in leotards is rumoured to be the 'sex tape' Kim Jong-Un used to justify the execution of his ex-girlfriend.

The seemingly innocuous clip shows the trio dancing to a version of Elvis' Aloha Oe in cowboy hats and tasselled skirts.

However reports from China - North Korea's only ally - that it was this video that led to the execution of Hyon Song-wol and 11 other entertainers.

This video of three Korean women dancing is rumoured to be the 'sex tape' used to justify the execution of Kim Jong-Un's ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-wol and 11 other entertainers

Chinese media identified this dancer as Hyon but reports are almost impossible to verify

Hyon Song-wol, right, was reportedly put to death by her ex-boyfriend Kim Jong Un, left, on August 30

A South Korean newspaper reported last
 week that Hyon had been killed by machine gun fire amid claims that she
 had been appearing in pornographic videos.

Twelve singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups are said to have been executed on August 20.

It was reported that they were accused of making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings.

Some
 of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are 
banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as 
political dissidents.

The isolated and secretive state has not commented and reports are almost impossible to verify.

A
 user on China's video-sharing website YouKu uploaded the video of the 
dancing trio and said it was the supposed 'sex tape', reported The Daily
 Dot.

The video has been watched 700,000 times.

Hyon rose to fame with her hit song A Girl in the Saddle of a Steed, or 'Excellent Horse-Faced Lady'

The killing has led to speculation Kim's wife Ri Sol-ju (left) was to blame

China's chnqiang news website said one of the dancers was Hyon.

Because Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju,  was 
once a member of the same group as the executed singer, North Korea 
analysts suggested that she might have given her consent to the 
execution.

Fuelling the speculation, there have been rumours that her husband was still seeing Hyon.

Without
 facing trial Hyon, said to be 28, and other members of North Korea’s 
most famous pop groups were marched in front of a firing squad and 
gunned down while their families and other members of the groups were 
ordered to watch.

The victims’ families and friends were then taken away to a labour camp, having been found ‘guilty  by association’.

North
 Korea has very little contact with the outside world and it is unlikely
 that the reason for the execution will ever be confirmed.

But
 Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, a Japanese expert on Korean affairs, 
said it was ‘simply not believable’ the entertainers were executed for 
making pornography, as they could simply have been made to ‘disappear’ 
in the prison system. He said: ‘As Kim’s wife once belonged to the same 
group, it is possible that these executions are more about Kim’s wife.’

Kim,
 30, who succeeded his late father as supreme leader of North Korea in 
2011, met Hyon ten years ago when he returned from studying in 
Switzerland. However, his father, Kim Jong-il, disapproved of the 
relationship and ordered the friendship to end.

Hyon went on to marry an officer in the North Korean military and is believed to have had a baby.

But
 rumours circulated that Kim was still secretly seeing her, which might 
account for reports that he was seen with a mystery woman in the months 
before his marriage to Ri, which was disclosed last  July. Ri and Kim 
are said to have a baby daughter.

Hyon and Kim knew each other as teenagers then had an affair when he was leader

Such
 is the secrecy surrounding Kim’s life it was initially reported that Ri
 was the singer who performed a series of bizarrely titled patriotic 
songs that had, apparently, stirred the nation.

However,
 it was really Hyon who had recorded Footsteps of Soldiers, I Love 
Pyongyang, She is a Discharged Soldier and We are Troops of the Party.

Ri
 was also given credit for Excellent Horse-Like Lady – also known as A 
Girl in the Saddle of a Steed – another of Hyon’s songs.

Kim
 has already displayed the ruthlessness that has made his family the 
world’s only communist dynasty, beginning with grandfather Kim Il-sung 
at the end of the Korean War in 1953.

He
 is said to have purged his stepmother from her position as a senior 
official in the ruling party to show his absolute power and had a 
minister executed by mortar round for showing disrespect by drinking 
during the official mourning period after Kim Jong-il’s death.
