The mother of Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson said today that her daughter is doing well and the family is relieved new guidelines for treating patients with the virus were now in place.

Debra Berry made the comments during an interview on Tuesday on Good Morning America.

Miss Vinson, 29, is being cared for in a specialized unit at Emory University Hospital near Atlanta, Georgia.

Ms Berry said the family is 'very confident' that Miss Vinson is receiving good care at Emory. 

Miss Vinson was part of the team that cared for Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Another nurse there also became infected.

Mr Duncan, 42, died on October 8.

In a statement released by Miss Vinson's family on Sunday, they said the nurse would never 'knowingly' put anybody at risk, was vigilant in testing herself for signs, and followed all the relevant protocols.

The statement attacked any suggestion that she ignored medical or government guidelines.

The statement added: 'In the interest of Amber and our family, we have retained esteemed attorney Billy Martin to provide us with legal counsel during this unfortunate and troubling time.'

Miss Vinson flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and flew back on October 13. She was hospitalized with the virulent illness hours after her return last week.

In the wake of the nurse's trip to plan her upcoming wedding, 153 people are being monitored for signs of the disease, and three are in quarantine. 

Medical staff who care for patients with Ebola are allowed to fly provided they were wearing protective gear while dealing with the virus.

The statement said she reported her body temperature three times before boarding her flight home last week. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged Miss Vinson checked in repeatedly and was cleared for travel.

Cleveland station WOIO reported the family's statement and said that they feel public comments and media outlets 'mischaracterize Amber and her actions'.

It said: 'Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful. 

'Although the majority of the correspondences we have received since her diagnosis have been positive, we are troubled by some of the negative public comments and media coverage that mischaracterize Amber and her actions.

'To be clear, in no way was Amber careless prior to or after her exposure to Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan. She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else.'

Three people have been quarantined in northeast Ohio following Vinson's visit to Cleveland to prepare for her wedding.

None of the three, quarantined after new monitoring guidelines by the state, has exhibited Ebola-like symptoms. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines on Monday aimed at protecting health workers treating Ebola patients. 

The CDC stipulates that medical personnel coming in contact or treating Ebola patients must cover all skin and hair. 

The previous set of guidelines - based on those from the World Health Organization - only required a mask and goggles.

Medical staff were previously required to only don a face shield, leaving some skin exposed, as shown by a nurse transporting a Texas deputy who had visited the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan (left). New guidelines require all skin to be covered (right)

The new guidelines also require healthcare workers to have hands-on training putting on and taking off protective equipment and to be supervised while suiting up before treating a patient.

Personal protective equipment, or PPE, for treating patients of the virus now includes a gown or coverall, disposable hoods, a respirator with face shield, boot covers and double gloves.

The CDC is strengthening its protocols in the wake of two nurses contracting the virus, which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and tissue, after treating Mr Duncan.

Miss Vinson's colleague, 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham, is being cared for at the National Institute for Health in Bethesda, Maryland after contracting the virus last week. 

The CDC has been widely criticized for its handling of Ebola cases diagnosed in the U.S. 

Amber Vinson reportedly spoke to a CDC official who cleared her to fly on a commercial flight with a fever of 99.5F after having treated Mr Duncan.

On Monday, 43 people were declared risk-free after being monitored for 21 days because they came in direct or indirect contact with Mr Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola after flying from Liberia last month. 

As of October 17, WHO reported the hemorrhagic fever has infected around 9,000 and killed more than 4,500 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa.
