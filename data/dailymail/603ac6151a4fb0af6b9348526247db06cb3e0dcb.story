When Ann Summers launched a 'find a face' campaign in November, the models they had apparently plucked from oblivion already looked a lot like professionals.

But in a victory for curvy women, the winner of the competition to find the face of the underwear chain's Valentine's Day campaign was the only plus-size finalist in the running.

Lucy Moore, a University of Westminster criminal justice student from Portsmouth secured an impressive 22 per cent of the public's 30,000 votes for Ann Summers' next star.

The 20-year-old was chosen from more than 4,000 entrants as one 
of the ten finalists to star in the chain's first ever TV advert which was screened during the final 
episode of ITV2’sThe Only Way is Essex.

She wowed the panel during the October judging day, which was only attended by a few plus-size models.

Miss Moore's stand out personality, body confidence and sexy, size 16 curves won over Ann Summers' CEO, 
Jacqueline Gold who chose to put her through to the finals.

The other nine women chosen were Sinead from 
Beaconsfield, Katie A from Essex, Mary from 
Clitheroe, Hayley from Dudley, Natalie from Huddersfield, Melanie from 
London, Kassidy from Hebburn, Katy K from London, and Abigail from 
Hartlepool.

Then, in a bid to win over the public, Miss Moore embarked on her own promotional tour building support for her campaign.

She
featured in her local newspaper as well as spending time in her local 
Ann Summers store as real life mannequin, modelling key lingerie lines 
in the store window.

Drumming up further support Lucy even donned the company's Miss Claus outfit 
for the opening of the new concept store in Milton Keynes, and even 
to Twitter and Facebook to build support from her followers and 
favourite celebrity tweeters.

Miss
Moore told MailOnline that although she has always wanted to be a model, she still could not believe that she had won.

She said: 'At school I was the biggest girl in my group of friends, so I avoided being teased by being fun and bubbly.

'Now all of my course mates at university have seen me in my underwear. It's a bit weird.'

Miss Moore added: 'This has been one of the most exciting things to happen to
me and I couldn’t believe I made it into a national modelling 
competition and have now won; it is beyond anything I could have 
imagined.

'Hopefully it will be an inspiration to other curvy girls and give them confidence.

'I kept looking at the other girls and thinking how beautiful they were. I thought any one of them could win it.

'I want to represent women with a curvier figure and show them 
that you can be sexy no matter what your size or shape.'

Jacqueline
Gold added: 'This has been such an exciting 
campaign for Ann Summers and I was amazed by the amount of entries we 
received.

'The campaign was about finding a real woman who embodied our brand and oozed sexiness and confidence.

'Lucy
really stood out for us and we are really looking forward to showing 
off our new Valentines collection with Lucy taking centre stage in the 
campaign and store windows.'

Lucy’s first campaign for Ann Summers will be revealed in store windows across the UK on the 19th January 2012.
