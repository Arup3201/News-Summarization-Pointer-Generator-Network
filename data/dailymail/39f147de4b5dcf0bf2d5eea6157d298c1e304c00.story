A father-of-three recovering from a failed penis enlargement operation has been found guilty of stabbing a young prostitute to death.

Michael Wenham, aged 36 years, murdered sex worker Karolina Nowikiewicz with a Stanley knife in her flat in Slough, Berkshire, last February.

The killing came as he was struggling to cope after a botched penis enlargement operation reduced his penis from five inches to three inches in length.

Following the seemingly unprovoked attack, he lay her face-down on her bed, showered himself clean and called his wife and the police, the court heard.

Wenham had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but pleaded not guilty to murder. However, a jury today found him guilty unanimously following an eight-day trial.

Reading Crown Court was told that at the time of Ms Nowikiewicz's death on February 17 last year, married Wenham was recovering from unsuccessful surgery on his genitals, carried out in the U.S. in late 2013.

The jury was told that Wenham still had a dressing on his penis which had affected his sex life with wife of eight years Dawn and that he was self-conscious about the size of his genitalia.

On the day of the killing, Wenham bought a pay-as-you-go mobile phone from an Argos store so he could arrange a meeting with a prostitute.

The IT contractor had also called in sick to work before heading to a hardware store and buying a Stanley knife, disposable gloves and plastic sacks which he used in the killing.

When the first woman he tried was unavailable, he booked to see Ms Nowikiewicz, arranging to meet her at her flat, where she worked as a prostitute to fund her studies.

Wenham, who was working on a project for the Office of National Statistics in Southampton, had been not taking his medication for depression in the days before the killing.

'The killing was utterly premeditated, planned and clinically executed,' Alan Blake, prosecuting, told the jury of six men and six women.

The jury at Reading Crown Court was told that the killing of Ms Nowikiewicz (pictured) was 'premeditated, planned and clinically executed'

'Attacking her from behind, he sliced open her neck, cutting through her major arteries and her spinal chord. There was no evidence that she had been able to even try to defend herself.

'The first prostitute he tried was unavailable. Tragically for Karolina, he booked to see her instead. There is no evidence to suggest that they had ever met before.

'Having killed Karolina and left her face-down on her bed, the defendant washed himself in the bathroom, placed the bloody knife in a drawer in the bedroom, went outside and called the police to admit to what he had just done.

'Although the victim was a prostitute both psychiatrists seem to agree that this was not in fact a sexual killing, in that there was no evidence of sexual assault, consensual sexual activity or even arousal.

'Karolina was chosen because her job made her an easy target.'

In a phone call to his wife Dawn following the killing, Wenham said: 'Hi, it’s me, I’ve done a stupid thing, I’ve killed someone, I’m really sorry, I’ve killed someone.'

He then begged her not to tell the couple’s two boys, aged six and five. They also have a one-year-old daughter.

During the trial, evidence given by Mrs Wenham revealed the scale of her husband's insecurities regarding his penis.

Self-conscious Wenham would ask his wife to tell him he had a small penis during sex and to mock him for his size. The court heard his penis was reduced to three inches following the botched enlargement operation.

Mrs Wenham told the jury how her husband enjoyed being spanked and liked the idea of her having sex with a well-endowed man.

The court heard he also enjoyed dressing up in women's clothes and being dominated and he had a smoking fetish.

Mrs Wenham told the court: 'He likes me to degrade him. He would ask me to say things to him like what a small penis he had and just generally sort of put him down.

'He liked the idea of me going with another man more well endowed than he is.'

The court heard Wenham paid around £15,000 for the penis enlargement operation because he wanted to make it broader. However, he ended up losing two more inches - leaving him with a three-inch penis.

She told the jury the couple went to a swingers club before he flew to Philadelphia in America for the operation in December 2013. They had group sex with another couple.

Mrs Wenham said: 'He asked me to ask the other man to have sex with me, but I said that was a step too far.'

Defending, Pavlos Panayi QC, asked: 'He felt he might lose you if he could not satisfy you in the way he had seen you satisfied by this couple?'

Mrs Wenham replied: 'Yes.'

Mr Panayi said: 'Even in the face of his massive insecurities, he was saying you should do that again.'

Mrs Wenham replied: 'Yes.'

The jury also heard that Wenham had fantasies about becoming a serial killer, killing radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudhry and mere hours before his attack on Miss Nowikiewicz, had emailed MI5 offering his help in infiltrating terrorist networks.

Psychiatrist Professor Seena Fazel said Wenham had told him the weekend before the attack he had thought about assassinating radical Muslim cleric Choudary and also about becoming a serial killer.

'He told me he was starting to think about ways to kill Islamic extremists,' said Professor Fazel. 'He mentioned to me a renowned cleric in London. He talked about it in the context of becoming a serial killer.'
