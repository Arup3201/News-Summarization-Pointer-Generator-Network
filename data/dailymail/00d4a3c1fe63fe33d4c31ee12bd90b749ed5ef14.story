Authorities say an airline passenger who took a cigarette break caused a security scare at New York City's Kennedy Airport that led to some flights delays.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says it happened late Saturday afternoon in Terminal 8 after the man had gone through security screening and then went out to smoke.

Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo  says the passenger returned through a gate that wasn't open.
