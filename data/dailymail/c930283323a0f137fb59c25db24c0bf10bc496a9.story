Paris Saint-Germain have hit out at Uefa's decision to close part of the Parc des Princes when the Ligue One club next play in the Champions League this season.

Uefa have clamped down on the French champions after it alleged that some of their supporters behaved abusively towards disabled Chelsea visitors at the Parc des Princes in last season's Champions League quarter-final clash.

As a result PSG, who will have automatic access to the group stage after winning Ligue 1 for the second campaign in a row, must close a section of their stadium for the first continental home tie they play in 2014-15.

A 
statement on the football organisation's website read: 'The Uefa 
Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the closure of sectors
 104 and 105 of Paris Saint-Germain’s stadium, the Parc des Princes, for
 the next Uefa competition match which Paris Saint-Germain would play as
 the host club.

'The
 sanction has been imposed for the discriminatory conduct of some Paris 
Saint-Germain supporters towards disabled fans of Chelsea at last 
season’s Uefa Champions League quarter-final first-leg match between the
 two clubs in Paris on 2 April 2014.'

In their decision of 21 July 2014, UEFA has ordered the partial closure of two stands of the Parc de Princes at the club's next home match of the UEFA Champions League.

This sanction was taken due to the conduct of some supporters towards disabled fans during the match against Chelsea on 3 April 2014, yet warranted no official report.

Paris Saint-Germain is surprised and shocked by this unfair decision and asks UEFA to transmit to the club the grounds for this decision; the first step to launching an appeal against this sanction.

Paris Saint-Germain would like to reiterate its stance against all forms of discrimination, both inside the stadium and in the community. That is the first vocation of the Paris Saint-Germain Foundation that, for the last 14 years, has developed educational programs to promote integration and offer opportunities to underprivileged children and youths.
