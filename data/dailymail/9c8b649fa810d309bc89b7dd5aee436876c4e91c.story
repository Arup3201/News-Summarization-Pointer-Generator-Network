A team of Manchester United legends managed to do what the Old Trafford club's current crop failed in doing - securing a draw against a Bayern Munich XI at the Allianz Arena. 

The two European powerhouses have enjoyed some great Champions League clashes down the years - and past heroes from both clubs were present in a 3-3 draw in a charity game at Bayern's home - with Andrew Cole starring with two goals including a brilliant backheel.

The former Reds frontman was reunited with his familiar striker partner Dwight Yorke - and it seemed to pay dividends with Paul Scholes feeding the strike pair from midfield.

Manchester United: Kuszczak, Irwin, Johnsen, Dublin, Martin, Blomqvist, P. Neville, Scholes, Fortune, Cole, Yorke.

Bayern Munich: Butt, Babbel, Kreuzer, Kovac, Pflugler, Van Bommel, Thon, Sergio, Breitner, Zickler, Elber. 

Lee Martin set up Cole's opener with just nine minutes gone - putting in a low cross that the 42-year-old was able to instinctively backheel past Hans-Joerg Butt in the Bayern goal.

Paulo Sergio then scored an equaliser two minutes later, slotting past Tomasz Kuszczak as he sent the Polish 'keeper the wrong way as he was bearing down on goal.

Former Brazilian forward Giovane Elber then made it 2-1 to the home side, evading Dion Dublin's tackle in the area before providing the simplest of finishes and celebrating by rolling around in a sponsor's sign behind the goal.

Scholes slotted home Yorke's cutback to draw United level again before Alexander Zickler beat the Reds offside trap to make it 3-2 to the home side.

That set it up perfectly for Cole to seal the draw with another smart finish with just seven minutes remaining as the game ended 3-3.
