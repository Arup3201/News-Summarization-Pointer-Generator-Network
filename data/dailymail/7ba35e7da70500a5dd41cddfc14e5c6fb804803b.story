A size eight woman had no idea she was pregnant... until her waters broke while she was walking her dog.

Even then, Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, just thought there was something wrong with her bladder, so went to A&E with her fiance Phil Jarvis to have herself checked out.

And when doctors at York Hospital told her she was about to have a baby she was completely dumbstruck, chiefly because she had never missed a contraceptive pill and had put on scarcely any weight.

When Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, pictured, felt her waters break while she was walking her dog, she just thought there was something wrong with her bladder, but three days later she gave birth to baby Jayden

She said: 'It was Friday the 13th and I
 thought they were joking. I was in complete shock. The doctor said to 
me: "Never in my life have I seen this. Are you sure you didn't know?"

'But I really had no idea. I didn't look 
pregnant at all. In the last month I'd put on a tiny bit of weight, but I
 put this down to comfort eating because I'd just lost a friend to lung 
cancer.'

Chelsea continued: 'My friend died on 11 November, and I'd spent the last eight months as his full-time carer.

'Since his death I'd put on about half a stone, and gone from a size eight to a size 10, but no way did I look pregnant.

'I just thought I needed to go on a diet. I started doing sit-ups and told myself I'd start going to the gym in January.'Chelsea, who lives with chef Phil, 42, in York, was transferred immediately to the hospital's labour ward.

Chelsea and Phil, who met three years ago
 while they were both working at the same bar in York city centre, were 
thrilled to finally take Jayden, pictured, home on Monday

She said: 'We were both in complete shock. I'd never wanted children - I just wasn't a children person. Phil already had a daughter from a previous relationship, and having children of our own was something we'd never discussed.

'When we got to the labour ward I was next to a woman who was screaming her head off and I just thought: 'Oh my God, that's going to be me soon'. I couldn't believe I was about to give birth.

'I fell in love immediately. I just sat looking at him 
thinking: "How has this happened?" I didn't want a baby, but now he's here I don't regret it at all.'

'Luckily, the nurses realised I need some peace and quiet to come to terms with what was happening and they moved me into a private room. I was there for three days before my contractions started.'

And after a very quick labour lasting just one hour and nine minutes, Chelsea's son Jayden arrived on 16 December 16 weighing 4lbs 1oz.

She said: 'They put him on my chest straight away and all I could think was: "What have I just done?"

'He was born one month prematurely, so they had to take him away to the special care baby unit to check he was OK.

'Later that day I was allowed to go and see him - and I fell in love immediately. I just sat looking at him thinking: "How has this happened?"

'I didn't want a baby, but now he's here I don't regret it at all.

'Despite being premature, he's really healthy and fortunately the fact I kept drinking because I didn't know I wasn't pregnant hasn't affected him.'

Chelsea and Phil, who met three years ago while they were both working at the same bar in York city centre, were thrilled to finally take Jayden home on Monday, 6 January, after more than three weeks in hospital.

She said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum. Looking back now there were a couple of signs. Back in July I'd been sick for about three days, but I just thought I had a virus that was going round. Now I know that was morning sickness.

'I'd also been having a few feelings in my tummy, but I'd just put that down to stress because of caring for my terminally-ill friend.

'I hadn't been having any periods, but that wasn't unusual for me.

'I think I was so preoccupied with looking after my terminally-ill friend I wasn't paying attention to my own body.'

She said family and friends had rallied round to help kit them out with secondhand baby clothes and equipment.

She said: 'We obviously hadn't been planning financially to have a baby, so the support from family and friends has been amazing.

'My life has suddenly changed forever, but I'm so happy. I love Jayden to bits.'
