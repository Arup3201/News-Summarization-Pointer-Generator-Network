The traditional elevator has had its day.

More than 160 years since cables and hoists were used on the very first lift systems in buildings, engineers have designed an alternative that uses magnets.

The setup uses magnetic levitation, or maglev, to pull elevator cabins horizontally as well as vertically quickly and smoothly.

Called Multi, the technology (illustrated) has been developed by ThyssenKrupp. The firm believes it will transform how people move inside buildings. Each of the cabins are self-propelled using a multi-level brake system. They transfer power from the shaft to the cabin using a magnetised coil running along the shaft

Called Multi, the technology has been developed by ThyssenKrupp.

It is reminiscent of the floating glass elevator seen in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl's book.

The German-based firm believes Multi will transform how people move inside buildings, reduce waiting times for passengers, and take up less space.

Each of the cabins are self-propelled using a multi-level brake system and transfer power from the shaft to the cabin and back again.

A magnetised coil running along the elevator shaft repels magnets on the outside of the cabins.

This allows the cabins to levitate above this so-called guideway.

Power is then moved along the coils in the guideway to pull and push the cabin up and down, or left and right.

This current changes to accommodate differences in polarity needed to keep the cabins in motion and moving in the correct direction.

This causes a magnetic field in front of the cabin to pull it forward, while a field at the rear adds thrust.

Because the cabins don’t touch the guideway, there is less friction meaning the ride is faster and smoother, and can also reduce energy.

The cabins don’t touch the guideway, so there is less friction and the ride is faster and smoother. ThyssenKrupp said that ideal building height for Multi installations starts at 985ft (300 metres), but it can be fitted to smaller constructions. It will be tested in a tower (pictured) in Rottweil, Germany in 2016

ThyssenKrupp said the ideal building height for Multi installations starts at 985ft (300 metres), but it can be fitted to smaller constructions.

‘Building design will no longer be limited by the height or vertical alignment of elevator shafts, opening possibilities to architects and building developers they have never imagined possible,’ said ThyssenKrupp executive Andreas Schierenbeck.

‘As the nature of building constructions evolve, it is also necessary to adapt elevator systems to better suit the requirements of buildings and high volumes of passengers.

‘From the one dimensional vertical arrangement to a two dimensional horizontal and vertical arrangement with more than one or two cabins operating in each shaft, Multi represents a proud moment in ThyssenKrupp’s history of presenting cutting-edge transport technologies.’

When running on a loop, the Multi has a targeted speed of 16ft (five metres) per second, meaning passengers would only need to wait for a cabin for up to 30 seconds.

It will be officially tested in a tower in Rottweil, Germany.

This tower is set to be completed at the end of 2016, and until then the firm is testing prototypes at its Essen headquarters.
