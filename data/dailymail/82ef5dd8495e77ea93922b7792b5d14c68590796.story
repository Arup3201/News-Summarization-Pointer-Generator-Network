With a baby on the way, it is the perfect royal retreat - large, leafy and discreet.

This is the Norfolk bolthole reportedly earmarked for parents-to-be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, just a stone’s throw from the Queen’s own private residence at Sandringham.

As revealed in the Mail last month, royal aides have been given planning permission to begin extensive improvements at Anmer Hall.

Plans: Anmer Hall will have a raft of changes to accommodate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their growing family, including a new 16ft x 16ft garden room and the planting of trees and shrubs

These include a new garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through, providing both shade and privacy on the patio area.

More importantly, however, King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council have also given the Queen, who is the Georgian mansion’s landlord, approval to re-route its existing driveway and plant dozens of new trees and shrubs to shield it from prying eyes.

The ten-bedroom property is one of 150 situated on the monarch’s 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and is only two miles east of Sandringham House, one of her favourite private residences.

The hall, which largely dates back to 1802, was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van Cutsem.

Prince William, who is close to the van Cutsems’ children, is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child.

It also has something of a royal pedigree having been leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990.

Its current tenant is businessman James Everett, who runs a kitchen worktop business from the grounds and has leased the property until 2017.

It is likely he will be asked to move out early in order to carry out the necessary building works in time for the couple to move in, meaning the Queen may have to compensate him.

The detailed planning application for Anmer Hall, described as a ‘major development’ in council papers, cannot be seen on the council website for security reasons and anyone wishing to view them has to be vetted by police.

Council officers approved the plans under delegated powers, which means they did not have to go through the usual council planning process.

According to the application an existing wood store will be converted into extra accommodation - mostly likely for police officers guarding the property - while a garage block will be transformed into an equipment room.

Other plans involve moving the main gates to the property further down a lane so members of the public will not be able to get so close to the house.

The new, longer private driveway will sweep across an existing field, currently used as grazing land, before reaching the front of the house, which has its own swimming pool and tennis court.

A new gate will be built across what is currently a public road and a lawn taken out to create extra parking space.

The current public entrance to nearby St Mary’s Church will become accessible only to the Duke and Duchess, with the approach road re-routed to create a new entrance for worshippers.

To compensate them the Queen will pay for a new car park to be built.

Although both Buckingham and St James’s Palaces have refused to comment on the plans, it has emerged this week that the new pergola and garden room will be designed by architect Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince Charles at his own country home.

Mr Morris, whose ancestors were responsible for building the Royal Albert Hall, built the Orchard Room at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, which is used by Charles for entertaining but has been described as a ‘Wimpey house’.

The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862.

Although much of the land is open to the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal family relaxing there, making it even more attractive to the Duke and Duchess.
