Watch out, Barbie! There's a new doll on the block - and she's dressed head-to-toe in some of the world's most coveted designer clothes.

Luxury fashion houses such as Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Lanvin have each designed a one-off doll kitted out in the finest fashion and it's all in the name of charity.

Each of the stylish dolls will go under the hammer at a UNICEF auction on December 2 and are expected to raise an estimated grand total of 200,000 euros (£166,000).

The figurines are on display at Paris's Petit Palais until December 1.

Each year, designers create bespoke dolls for the annual Frimousses de Créateurs event, now in its 11th year.

Each of their designs is inspired by 
their idea of 'Wonderful Paris' and this year has seen 42 fashion houses
 and new designers getting involved.

All proceeds will go towards providing vaccinations for children in the Darfur region of Sudan.
