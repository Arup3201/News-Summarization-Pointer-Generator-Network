It is an audacious gamble that could determine who the next US president will be.

In a last-ditch attempt to reconnect with the American people, Mitt Romney will parade his family on stage on the first day of the Republican presidential convention in Florida tomorrow – all 140 of them.

The four-day convention is the biggest event of the former Massachusetts governor’s stuttering bid  to become the 45th president of  the USA.

Four hundred and fifty days into Romney’s campaign, and with just ten weeks to go until the election, the Republican Party’s presumptive nomination is struggling to overcome the negative impact of his various gaffes, his apparently contradictory positions on several key issues including healthcare and abortion, and questions about his business career and wealth.

Most polls have Barack Obama very slightly ahead, but in real terms the contest is neck and neck.

The convention, which is likely to focus on economic issues and will be watched by a TV audience of more than 20 million people, will be the make-or-break moment for Romney because it will mark the point at which the majority of Americans will start to take notice of the presidential campaign.

Conventions usually have a significant impact on a candidate’s prospects, and with six out of ten Americans saying they find it impossible to relate to his impassioned defence of traditional values, the former Mormon bishop is pinning his hopes on his family.

He calculates that by portraying ‘Tribe Romney’ as a typically dysfunctional American family, he will win over voters.

Against the backdrop of a tasteful wood-panelled set – originally built for Oprah Winfrey – the 65-year-old billionaire will introduce relatives who range from his sister Jane (who was obliged by a failed marriage to take up an acting career) to a brother who was excommunicated for his sexual sins by the Mormon church.

‘The Romneys are believing Latter-day Saints but they are neither saints nor are they exempt from  the influences of the world around them,’ one of his cousins, Ronald Scott, observes in his new biography, Mitt Romney: An Inside Look At The Man And His Politics.

Behind the good looks, Scott confides, the family’s attempts to adjust to ‘pressures and temptations’ make the confessions that will be aired on stage worthy of any reality show. 

Married to Ann, the blonde granddaughter of a Welsh coalminer, Mitt Romney has five sons and 18 grandchildren, which historians say may make him the most fecund White House candidate ever.

Tagg Romney, 42, is Mitt’s oldest son. Like his father, he is an investment banker and so will help emphasise his father’s economic credentials. Tagg and his wife Jennifer have six children, and his four brothers also have families, but three of them ‘have wrestled with fertility issues,’ says Scott, and resorted to IVF treatment, seemingly inconsistent with their father’s moral views.

‘They even employed a fairly compensated surrogate mother,’ claims Scott. He declined to identify which sons but notes that surrogacy is ‘strongly discouraged’ by the Mormon church, to which all the family belong. 

Matt Romney, 41, the second son, is a property developer. He and his wife Laurie have four children. The couple irked Mitt’s fellow Republicans last year when they attended a Halloween party dressed as Sarah Palin and her husband Tom.

Josh Romney, 37, is considering a political career. The son and his wife Jenn have five children. After serving in England as a Mormon missionary, he became a male model in New York, but Scott says he became disenchanted by the ‘meat market decadence’. American audiences love a dramatic narrative.

Ben Romney, 34, is a doctor. The son and his wife Ande have one child. Ben is said to be the most  ‘un-Romneylike’ of the brothers. Though he has agreed to appear with his family at the convention, he has no interest in politics.

Craig Romney, 31, is the youngest son and a former advertising executive. He and wife Mary have two children, one of whom, Parker, is playing a major role in his grandfather’s attempt to soften his image.

He has repeatedly given interviews about how the four-year-old once fashioned his hair into a mohawk using egg whites and glue. ‘Man, that was one bad hair day,’ he says.

Margo Lynn Keenan, 77, is Romney’s elder sister. She had eight children by her late husband, federal prosecutor Loren Keenan, and the convention will hear she has lived a self-effacing life, devoting herself to the care of her youngest son, who has Down’s syndrome.

Lynn has grappled with other difficult issues. Mitt opposes abortion but she is expected to tell the audience he will not ‘force’ his beliefs on women because her sister-in-law  (Loren’s sister) died during a botched backstreet termination.

JaneRomney, Mitt’s sister, is expected to reduce the house to tears with a deeply personal story. Now 74, the immaculately preserved bottle blonde dreamed of following her mother, Lenore, into a career as an actress. But she put aside her ambitions to start a family when, aged 20, she married a nephew of Gordon Hinckley, the head prophet of the Mormon church.

After more than two decades of marriage, and four children, the couple had an acrimonious divorce.  ‘Family members told me Jane had a terrible divorce,’ said Scott. ‘It destroyed her life. Her husband had been a terrific philanderer.’

Aged 42, she decided to ‘resume’ her acting career, although roles have been few. In Florida she is expected to admit to another skeleton in the Romney family closet: she once campaigned for two of California’s best-known Democratic politicians. However, she now says she is a committed Republican.

Tight: There's not much in it for the race to be President between Romney and the current premier Barack Obama

‘I’ll be at the convention for six or seven days,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I have a big story to tell.’Scott Romney, Mitt’s 71-year-old brother, is expected to deliver a frank testimonial about ‘sin and redemption’, says a party insider.

Scott shared his brother’s passion for politics, yearning to follow in the footsteps of their father, George, a millionaire car tycoon and governor of Michigan. But he failed to become Michigan’s chief law officer.

He was ‘sealed for eternity’ in a Mormon temple ceremony to a TV presenter, Ronna Stern. After bringing up six children – five of their own and hers from a previous marriage – they divorced in 1992.

Later, he was ‘disfellowshipped’ from the Mormon church when he married Ellen Rogers, a TV host who, in what Scott’s book calls a ‘religious transgression’, was pregnant with his child. He and Ellen divorced in 2009. In July last year, he married a widow, Sheri Lelalian. 

First wife, Ronna, now 68, will attend the convention, with Sheri and all seven of his children (including two by Ellen) and their seven grandchildren.

It should all make for dramatic viewing. Will it prove to be car-crash TV, dashing Romney’s presidential ambitions? Or a masterstroke that sets his campaign alight?
