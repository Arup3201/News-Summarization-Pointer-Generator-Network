James Milner has often been a target of derision from England fans - but after Wednesday night's horror show against Norway, they may well have had a point this time.

The Manchester City midfielder replaced Jack Wilshere in the second half of the 1-0 win at Wembley but his cameo was not a resounding success.

The 28-year-old - who may win his 50th cap against Switzerland on Monday - has only played quarter of an hour for City  in the Premier League this season and it showed as his touch was heavy and off target.

Finding his range? James Milner's stray crossfield pass was closer to finding a fan in the stands

Poised: England substitute Milner gets ready to send the ball crossfield to his team mate

Shocker: Sadly for Milner the pass looks to be heading the wrong way immediately after leaving his boot

Despair: Milner's pass summed up England's lacklustre performance during the 1-0 win over Norway

Out of touch: Milner has only featured for 15 minutes for Manchester City in the league this season so far

Disappointing: The 28-year-old certainly wasn't the only player to under perform as England struggled 

Fans have immediately seized upon Milner’s woes by posting his disastrous attempt at switching play to John Stones during the Norway friendly on Vine and another displaying his poor attempt at a short corner.

His attempted crossfield pass to Stones was not received well inside Wembley either, with ironic cheers greeting the ball sailing out of play, miles away from its intended target.

Milner has been (unfairly) booed on to the pitch before by England fans and is seen by many as the safe option, emblematic of Roy Hodgson's squad.

Sadly for England this was not a rare occurrence as the squad performed drastically below par ahead of Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.
