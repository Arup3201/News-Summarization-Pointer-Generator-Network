Few people manage to overshadow the Queen. But all Elizabeth Cambage had to do today was stand next to her.

At 6ft 8in in her bare feet and 7ft in her heels, the basketball player towered over the 5ft 4in monarch who had to look skywards to say hello.

The Queen met British-born Miss Cambage after a civic reception during her Australian tour and immediately saw the funny side.

At 6ft 8in, basketball player Elizabeth Cambage towered over the Queen (and most other guests)

It was in stark contrast to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who the day before had greeted the Queen as she arrived in the country with a handshake and a bow instead of following protocol with a curtsey.

And despite the row that ensued, Miss Gillard still refused to curtsey when she met the Queen today.

Instead she performed two shallow 
bows of her head, once as she entered a room at Parliament House, 
Canberra, and a second time as she approached the Queen whose hand was 
outstretched.

She quickly put her hand out to the monarch and shook it. She also stood with lips sealed as the British anthem was played at the start of the reception in the Monarchâ€™s honour.

She did, however, sing the Australian anthem.

The Queen later met Miss Cambage who, without her shoes, is 6ft 8in tall.

There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms.

For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way.

On presentation to The Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'.

For male members of the Royal Family the same rules apply, with the title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and subsequently 'Sir'.

For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am' in later conversation.

'Oh,' exclaimed the Queen when she 
came across Elizabeth in the foyer of the Australian Parliament building
after a civic reception, 'you must be a basketball player.'

'Yes, I 
am,' replied Elizabeth as, having no other choice, she made a very deep 
curtsey.

Then the younger woman asked the 
Queen, with a cheeky grin: 'What gave it away?'

'You are very tall,' 
said the Queen, looking up to make the comment. 'That must be an advantage.'

'It is a bit,' said Elizabeth.

Clearly amazed by Elizabeth's height,
the Queen turned to Prince Philip, who was standing a short distance 
away 'This is an Australian basketball player,' she said, gesturing 
towards the sportswoman.

The Duke peered upwards. 'Yes,' he 
said,' that would be right.'

Dressed in a very long pink Carla Zampatti 
gown that reached down to her ankles, Elizabeth the sportswoman, who was
born in Guys Hospital, London said later: 'The Queen is very sweet and 
Prince Philip seems like a lot of fun.

'He was grinning when he made his 
comment about the Queen being right when she guessed I played 
basketball' Elizabeth's Nigerian father stands at 6ft 4in and her mother
is 6ft.

'I don't have any brothers and sisters so I expect I've inherited all the tall genes,' said the lanky basketballer.

Her
parents met in a London nightclub but three months after Elizabeth was 
born her parents separated and her Caucasian mother moved to Melbourne 
with her.

It was there,
after proving herself in her school's basketball team, Elizabeth became
a professional member of Melbourne's Bulleen Boomers and also played 
for the Australian Opals. She also played for the Tulsa Shock in the US.

She doesn't have a boyfriend at present, she said, but it was obvious to everyone standing nearby after the Queen had been toasted at the civic reception that to avoid any awkwardness any suitor would need to have some high standing in the community.

And travelling around in cars? 'Not a problem,' she said. 'I just have to move the seat back a bit.'

Then, the sportswoman who without shoes still stands a soaring 6ft 8in in her bare feet, made her way for the door, a head and shoulders above all the other guests.

Earlier, British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard added to the controversy already surrounding her following her decision not to curtsey before the Queen, when she stood with lips sealed as the British anthem was played at the start of the reception in the Monarch's honour.

She did, however, sing the Australian anthem.

Eventually the pair sat to discuss Australia's political situation and the precarious nature of a minority government

The Queen and Miss Gillard seemed to be getting along well as they chatted at a reception at Parliament House

Miss Gillard, in a veiled reference 
to the possibility of Australia becoming a republic one day, told the 
Queen in her speech that 'we do not know where Australia's path of 
nationhood may lead in the times to come.'

But she added that she knew for a certain that the Queen's journey of service would continue.

Earlier in the day when the pair first
met at Parliament House, the Queen offered a hand to the Australian 
premier who then reciprocated and shook it and performed a shallow bow.

Ms Gillard has faced criticism for 
deciding not to curtsey to the Queen when she greeted the monarch as she
touched down in the country with Prince Philip.

As the pair shook hands the republican said: 'Good morning your majesty, its lovely to see you again.'

Referring
to the bright sunshine blazing down on the grounds, conditions Canberra
has enjoyed since the monarch arrived with the Duke of Edinburgh on 
Wednesday, the Queen replied: 'It's beautiful again.'

Ms Gillard said: 'It is a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'm glad the weather was so good for you yesterday.'

Ahead of the reception the Queen walked among people in the Marble Foyer

While
there she also met with Tony Abbott, the leader of the country's 
opposition Liberal Party, where they discussed the problems of forming 
minority governments.

She 
was referring to the experiences of Miss Gillard who had weeks of 
political wrangling before she formed a government after elections that 
produced no overall winner.

The Queen rarely speaks about 
her personal views in public and her words were recorded by the waiting 
media who were given access to the first few moments of the audience.

But
her comments were also formed by recent experiences as there were a 
number of anxious days before David Cameron was able to form a coalition
government with the Liberal Democrats last year.

Mr
Abbott met the monarch for an audience in the morning room of 
Canberra's Government House after the sovereign had held discussions 
with Ms Gillard.

The Queen wasted no time raising the issue of the precarious state of Australian politics saying: 'It is an interesting time.'

Australia's
minority government is the first in decades and commentators have said 
it could easily be threatened by a ministerial misdemeanour or 
by-election.

Mr Abbott replied to the Queen's 
opening statement saying: 'It is never dull, we play our politics tough 
in this country and give no quarter, Australian society is always 
dynamic.'

He made the Queen laugh when he added: 'We like to think we're the happening place your majesty.'

The
monarch replied 'a minority government is always a difficult thing to 
organise', before the talks continued behind closed doors for almost 20 
minutes, half the time the sovereign spent with the Prime Minister.

The
Queen and the Prime Minister chatted about the previous day's events, 
when the royal couple toured Lake Burley Griffin in a VIP motor launch 
and attended the flower festival.

The
Queen said: 'It was very popular, there were lots of people there to 
see the boat go past', and Ms Gillard replied: 'I suspect there were 
more people because you were there.'

The monarch added: 'It was very nice to be able to do that and see the flowers. I had no idea that they do that every year.'
