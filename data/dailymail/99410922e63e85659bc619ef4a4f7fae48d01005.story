A widow who faked her new husband's will to make her and her son sole beneficiaries of his £1million fortune is facing jail.   

Legal secretary Dawn Smith drew up the bogus document in her office two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey.

The 47-year-old cut her husband's two daughters out of the will and claimed that he wanted to leave his estate to her and her son from a previous relationship.

She has since married again - to a waiter in the Turkish resort of Marmaris - and is now working as a bailiff for a debt company.

Smith has left debts against her late husband's name by not settling the £3,600 bill for his funeral, police revealed. 

She also sold family heirlooms destined for Mr Smith's daughters to fund her trips to Turkey. 

It emerged she has visited Turkey almost once a month between the death of Mr Smith and her first court appearance in February.

Smith has been ordered to hand in her passport by a judge as she awaits sentencing after admitting charges of forgery and making a false statement on oath. 

Mr Smith's daughter Karen, 43, said: 'I've not even grieved for his death yet as this has been so upsetting.

'It is hard not knowing what my dad's final wishes were. She took that away.'

Harvey Smith, who owned an engineering firm, was given an MBE for services to industry in 1986.

Smith faked the signatures of her husband, another legal secretary and a solicitor on the bogus document she drew up in 2010.

After his death in November 2012, she told his family she didn't believe he had a last will and testament.

But she later produced the paperwork - back-dated to February 2011 - which left their £500,000 house in Darlington and £420,000 pension to her.

It excluded Karen and included explicit instructions that her sister Zoe, 25, should not receive anything at all. 

Her deception was uncovered when a partner at the Darlington law firm of Hewitts, where Smith had worked, thought it suspicious the women were overlooked while Dawn Smith's son was included.

The lawyer - a personal friend of Mr Smith - raised concerns and staff spotted basic errors.

One of the supposed witnesses had left the firm at the time they were said to have signed it, and the other had changed offices.

Police were alerted and a handwriting expert concluded that Mr Smith's signature was not the same as legitimate ones provided by detectives.   

At Teesside Crown Court, Smith, 47, was also ordered to report to police twice a week until she is sentenced early next month. The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.

Her barrister, Caroline Goodwin, said Smith wanted to travel to Turkey to 'settle her affairs' before the likely prison term.

But Judge John Walford said: 'My immediate reaction to that proposal would be unfavourable. Restrictions should be placed on her movements.'

And he warned Smith: 'You should not be misled into thinking my adjourning for a report and granting you bail doesn't mean that prison is likely.'

Smith wed her wealthy husband three years before his death and moved into his detached three-storey home in Darlington, in 2006.

Detective Constable Mick Trodden, who investigated the case, described Smith's crimes as 'cynical and calculating'. 

Brenda Davidson, managing partner of Hewitts Solicitors, said: 'The actions of Dawn Smith were outside the course of her employment and came to light many months after she had left the firm. 

'As soon as we became aware of the situation we notified the police and co-operated fully in the investigation.'
