Peyton Manning and the rest of the Denver Broncos team may have suffered an embarrassing loss at last year's Super Bowl, but they're starting the new season on a happy note.

The 38-year-old quarterback was filmed breaking out into dance during warm-ups and playfully letting his twin 3-year-olds tackle him on the field during summer practice this week.

On Monday, the fifth day of summer training, Peyton was filmed shamelessly busting a move to 'Rocky Top' which is the fight song of his alma mater, the University of Tennessee.

School pride: The 38-year-old quarterback couldn't help but start dancing when his alma mater's fight song came over the stadium speakers

Peyton's good attitude was so contagious that other members of his team joined in the silly dancing, including Broncos receiver Wes Welker, a Texas Tech graduate.

The day before, Peyton was seen goofing around with his family on the field.

After signing some autographs, Peyton let his 3-year-old son Marshall tackle him while twin Mosley played in the turf and sucked on a lollipop.

Like father, like son: Son Marshall decided to try out some football moves by tackling his dad, while daughter Mosley looked more interested in her lollipop

Peyton and wife Ashley had Marshall and Mosley on March 31, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The twins' birth came just 10 days after Peyton's brother Eli, quarterback for the New York Giants, and his wife Abby had their first daughter Ava Frances.

The Eli Mannings now have another daughter, Lucy, who was born in June 2013.
