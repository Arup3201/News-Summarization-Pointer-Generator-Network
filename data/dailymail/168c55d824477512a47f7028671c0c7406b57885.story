A woman began to scream hysterically on an American Airlines flight bound for Tampa screaming 'God your my saviour!'

In a video posted to YouTube, the woman who was traveling from Miami to Tampa repeatedly screamed over and over leaving passengers around her deeply unsettled.

As she shouts,'God, you’re my savior! God, you’re my savior!' she flips through a magazine with one hand and taps restlessly on her cellphone with the other.

Seeking salvation: The blonde woman in this YouTube video had an epic meltdown as the man in the black hat tried to calm her down

As she repeated the phrase, the woman began contorting and shaking in her seat

The man who shot the video says the woman began her rant about 20 minutes after takeoff.

Initially she asked people sitting nearby to pray for her because her mother who had recently died - then the yelling began.

Although
 flight attendants didn't restrain the woman, they did ask passengers to 
intervene if she headed towards the back of the plane and attempt to 
open the doors. 

Get me out of here: The woman in the aisle seat can't get off the plane fast enough

The video, uploaded  to YouTube last October, has had well over 690,000 views, and shows the woman going 
crazy as the plane lands in Tampa.

Shot
 by Reed Stanley, the video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical
 woman trying to calm her down. His failure to calm her elicits an 
exasperated shrug of the shoulders.

‘She’s
 been freaking out for the last 20 minutes,’ Mr Stanley explains over 
the shouting woman. ‘She started off by telling everyone to pray for her
 mother who just passed away.

‘She
 went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother,’ 
Mr Stanley further explains as the woman’s tirade shows no signs of 
slowing down. ‘

'The flight attendant has asked me that if she tries to head to the back door of the plane, I'm to block her.'

A man in the seat next to her appeared to be trying to calm her down, patting her arm and attempting to soothe her.

‘I don’t know if this guy next to
 her knows her or not,’ Mr Stanley further narrates over the unending 
barrage of proclamation, ‘but he’s been trying to calm her down the 
whole time.’

Other jittery travelers stared into space and tried not to pay attention to the woman.

The man’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her, as she points and yells ‘don’t f**king touch me’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to God for cursing.

She then goes right back into repeating ‘God you’re my savior and fast and loud as she can.

Clearly distraught: The crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant

Eventually, she appears to run out of steam, finally quieting down, Mr Stanley explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman doesn’t make a run for the plane’s door.

‘If she tries to go back, we’re going to block her,’ Mr Stanley said as the woman’s meltdown caught a second wind.

Though not as loud and fast as before, the mantra is repeated over and over.

It is not clear what the woman’s ultimate fate was, she has not been publicly identified.

Then, like a voice from the heavens, an automated message advised passengers to ‘remain in their seats’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate.

Salvation had finally come for the passengers, the end of their hellish flight.
