She was inconsolable when he died aged 56 in December her health took a turn for the worse.

Devoted: Carol West was devastated when her husband of 30 years Michael was diagnosed with cancer

On Tuesday she was taken ill and passed away in hospital with the couple’s three children at her bedside.

The couple’s son Tony, 23, said yesterday he was convinced his mum died 'from a broken heart'.

He said: 'They couldn’t live without each other - it’s as simple as that.

'My mum took my dad’s death very badly. She couldn’t stop crying and her health became very bad.'She’d had a stroke five years ago but we never expected her to pass away so soon after Dad died.'

He added: 'To lose both parents is very hard and we are all a bit numb.

'They both loved Christmas so not having him there this year was very hard for her.'

The couple, from Sudbury, Suffolk, fell in love at first sight when they were teenagers.

They met when Tony, then 16, nearly rode his bike into 14-year-old Carol as she walked down the street.

Tony added: 'My dad shouted at her to get out of the way, they got talking and it went from there.'

Michael worked as a machine setter in Sudbury for 35 years while Carol took a job putting the pieces in Trivial Pursuit boxes.

Tony added: 'Mum and Dad were the best parents anyone could have. He was a joker and she was the feisty one - she kept him in line.

'They were just completely in love.'
