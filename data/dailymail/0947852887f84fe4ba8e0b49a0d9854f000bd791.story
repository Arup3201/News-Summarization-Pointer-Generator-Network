An American couple convicted in Qatar of child endangerment will receive a final verdict on their appeal next month, a Qatari judge announced on Monday.

Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles were originally jailed on murder charges following the January 2013 death of their adopted daughter Gloria. 

They were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving during the trial.

'It feels like there is no end to this,' Matthew Huang told reporters outside the courtroom Monday. 'The Qatar government is ignoring the calls of the U.S. government for our release'

They were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving during the trial. In March, the court sentenced them to three years in prison for child endangerment

In March, the court sentenced them to three years in prison for child endangerment.

The Huangs, of Asian descent, have remained out of prison during their appeal. 

They have insisted that their daughter, who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits.

'It feels like there is no end to this,' Matthew Huang told reporters outside the courtroom Monday. 

'The Qatar government is ignoring the calls of the U.S. government for our release.'

Matthew Huang had been working in the booming Gulf nation as part of infrastructure improvements for Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup. 

The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States. 

Washington has urged its Gulf ally to lift their travel ban. 

The couple met with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith on Sunday.

The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night. 

The girl was pronounced dead when the Huangs took her to the hospital in January 2013.

A Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's autopsy found that the child's hips, ribs and spine protruded and concluded the cause of death was dehydration and wasting disease.

The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. 

An investigative report by Qatari police had raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were 'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website.

The Huangs, of Asian descent, have two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the U.S.

Matthew Huang described the allegations as 'ridiculous' and called on President Barack Obama to explain to the ruler of Qatar 'why American families adopt high-need children.'

Gloria, who was severely malnourished in early childhood, would periodically refuse food for several days and then binge eat or get food from bizarre sources, such as garbage cans or from strangers - a behavior her parents traced to her impoverished upbringing and were trying to address. 

She would also try to leave the house at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on late-night binges, according to a report prepared last year in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic pathologist who reviewed the case for the family 

The Huangs will be able to take their case to a higher court after the appeals verdict, though Qatar's highest judicial body traditionally rules in favor of the lower court's rulings.
