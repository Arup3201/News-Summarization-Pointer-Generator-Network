Killed: Richard Jordan, 67, was hurled from his bike - and police said it was an accident within minutes

The police watchdog has slammed a force which made a string of failures over a cyclist’s death - including saying it was an accident after just 15 minutes' investigation.

Richard Jordan, 67, was hurled from his bicycle in a country lane almost three years ago, dying of catastrophic head injuries.

Yet paramedics did not tell police the crash had happened until a day later and, when they did investigate, they indicated there was 'no third party involvement' after 15 minutes - before they had visited the scene or interviewed any witnesses.

It then emerged at Mr Jordan’s inquest
 that the two main witnesses argued during their 999 call about whether 
their car had hit him.

Mr 
Jordan's widow Sue, 66, who lives near Ashford, Kent, has called for the
 investigation to be reopened ever since and fears she will never know 
exactly how her husband died.

She
 complained to Kent Police, and the force carried out an internal probe which confirmed a number of failings in the 
investigation - including forensic evidence being lost when a bag 
containing his clothes was left open.

But she claimed the internal probe did not go far enough, and complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

Now the IPCC has upheld her complaint, ordering Kent Police to reinvestigate many aspects of how it dealt with Mrs Jordan's complaint.

Many decisions in the original probe into Mr Jordan's death also come under fire 
in the IPCC report, which has been seen by MailOnline.

It said paramedics’ decision not to tell police about the crash had compromised any hope the family had of knowing how Mr Jordan died.

'The
 delay would undoubtedly have been detrimental’, it said, ‘most 
significantly due to the potential loss of opportunities to seize 
forensic evidence at the scene.’

Grief: Mr Jordan's widow Sue (left with her son Neil) has battled Kent Police for almost three years. Now an IPCC report has upheld her complaint against the force and told officers to look at aspects of the case again

'Bungling': Retired BT engineer Mr Jordan died of catastrophic head injuries after coming off his bicycle in a country lane. Police were initially not told about the accident at all by paramedics for more than 24 hours

The report then questioned why it took four days before the force took a statement from the car driver who dialled 999.

And it questioned why they did not seize their car itself, which has since been scrapped.

'The
 vehicle had been involved with an incident which had led to a man's 
death,’ the report said, yet police gave ‘no explanation’ for it not 
being taken away.

Damage was
 found on the front bumper, but the owner ‘apparently accounted for this
 damage as being present on the vehicle when he purchased it.

'This explanation appears to have been accepted... however, it is unclear on what basis [the PC] reached this view.

'It appears that [he] discounted the possibility of a direct collision from the outset'.

The car's driver, the report said, 'appears to have potentially provided inaccurate information relating to the vehicle history.

'However,
 it does not appear that this has been subject to any significant 
scrutiny by the officers investigating the collision.'

Country lane: The crash happened in this lane close to Mr Jordan's village home near Ashford, Kent

Care: Mr Jordan cycled the same route five times a week after being bought a bicycle for his 50th birthday. An internal investigation also found forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open

Kent
 Police has also been ordered to reinvestigate the family's claims that 
officers were 'rude' and 'condescending' towards them.

And
 the report said there was not enough evidence that the force had 
learned lessons from the row, suggesting more officers could be 
reprimanded.

It added: 'At 
this stage, it is not possible to determine whether or not any officer 
has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, as your 
complaints have not been sufficiently investigated.'

Three officers received 'management action' over the row, but the family were not told what that was.

Mrs Jordan said the IPCC report vindicated her three-year campaign and was ‘absolutely brilliant’.

She
 told MailOnline: ‘All through this process we’ve had nobody listen to 
us and it’s a sense of relief that someone’s taken our complaints 
seriously and agreed.

‘We 
will never stop fighting until we get justice. If it gets to the point 
where police are found to have carried out a flawed investigation then I
 think we should have a fresh inquest.

Bond: Mr Jordan pictured with his son Neil before his death in 2011. The family say they find it hard to grieve

‘We can’t grieve. I can’t get any of it out of my head. We’ve had to keep reliving it and reliving it for the last three years.’

Retired
 BT engineer Mr Jordan, who was married to Sue for 44 years, took up 
cycling after his children bought him a bike for his 50th birthday.

The
 pensioner suffered a seven-inch fracture to his skull despite wearing a 
helmet when he crashed on November 24, 2011 near his home in Old Wives 
Lees, Kent.

He was taken to hospital where he was ruled unfit for surgery and died later the same day.

But
 paramedics did not tell police and they only found out more than 24 
hours after the crash - by which time the scene had long since been 
cleared.

Fifteen minutes 
after being told and before they interviewed any witnesses or visited 
the scene, police said no third party had been involved - a decision the
 force has since admitted was wrong.

Changes: Ambulance chiefs in the south east have altered their policy on cyclists since Mr Jordan died

The report said it was 'not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated'

Consequences: The IPCC noted that one of the crash investigators was not fully-qualified at the time

Yet
 because of the way the complaints system worked, Mr Jordan's family had
 to wait until after an inquest recorded his death as an accident before
 their concerns could be addressed.

And
 at the inquest they were shocked to hear the distressing 999 call, in 
which the car's driver could be heard arguing with his girlfriend 
passenger about whether the car hit Mr Jordan.

The woman could be heard saying: 'The back end of the bike hit us', to which he
 replied: 'No it didn't, we didn't hit him at all. He came off and then 
we hit the bike, we went over the bike. That was what happened because 
he just absolutely lost it.'

Happy family: The cyclist with his wife and son Paul

Police listened to the call and decided not to re-interview the pair.

The family had called for 
prosecutors to investigate the force's conduct, but the IPCC said that part of their complaint could not be supported as 
there was no evidence of a criminal offence by police.

One
 small victory for the family, however, was that the South East Coast 
Ambulance Service has now changed its policy because of the case to tell
 police immediately whenever a cyclist is hit.

The
 move was hailed as a small step forward in the rights of cyclists, more
 than 3,000 of whom were seriously injured on Britain's roads last year -
 alongside 109 who died.

Mrs
 Jordan said: ‘I feel what we did with getting the ambulance process 
changed will help other cyclists, and I feel what we’re doing now is 
fighting for other people who’ve gone through the same thing.’

A
 force spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Kent Police is very sorry that the 
family of Richard Jordan didn’t feel they received the service they 
deserved from Kent Police. The issues raised by the IPCC make 
disappointing reading and raise a number of concerns that we are taking 
very seriously.

‘We will be
 reinvestigating the family’s complaints and further review the evidence
 already gathered. As directed by the IPCC, this will be to establish 
whether the original recommendations were sufficient or whether there 
are any failings that have not been identified so far. We will of course
 keep the family updated at all stages of this review.

‘We
 will endeavour to do everything we can to rectify this difficult 
situation and our sympathy is with Richard Jordan’s family following 
their very sad loss.’
