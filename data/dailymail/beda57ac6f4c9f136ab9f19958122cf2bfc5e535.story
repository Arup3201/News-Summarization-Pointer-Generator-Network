A notorious anti-Semitic comedian has been spared jail for tweeting his sympathy for the terrorist behind the Paris Jewish supermarket massacre, which killed four people.

Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, used the rallying slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' to make a joke relating to gunman Amedy Coudlibaly, who murdered a policewoman and carried out the devastating attack on the kosher supermarket in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January. 

The provocative entertainer had denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which 'pretends' to be a bastion of free speech.

Comedian: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' after posting a joke on Facebook which referred to the gunman behind the Paris kosher supermarket attack

He also maintained that he 'condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity.'

But M'bala, who has previous convictions for anti-Semitism, was found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' following his trial at the Palais de Justice in Paris.

The court heard how, just days after the Paris attacks in January, he had posted on Facebook 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly'. 

The post combined the 'Je Suis Charlie' slogan with the name of one of the gunman involved in the supermarket hostage.

Terrorist Amedy Coulibaly was also a close friend of Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the gunmen involved in the Charlie Hebdo shooting at the satirical magazine.

Staff working at the publication's headquarters were targeted in January for drawing insulting cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed and for attacking Muslims generally.

During the trial, defence barrister Sanjay Mirabeau said Dieudonne's arrest in January was disproportionate. Yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes.

Mr Mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out 'because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh'. He was given a two-month suspended prison sentence.

President Francois Hollande's government ordered a major clampdown on hate-speech following the terrorist attacks, which left a total of 20 people dead, including Coulibaly and the two other terrorists. 

Dieudonne drew international attention last year when football star Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-Semitic.

Called a 'quenelle', it has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion.  

Al Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support.

Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites, including synagogues, mosques and travel hubs.
