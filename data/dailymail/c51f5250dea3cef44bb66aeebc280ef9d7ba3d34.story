A woman who caught a man taking lewd photographs of her as she walked down some stairs on a train confronted him and demanded he delete the pictures.

The 30-year-old woman was getting off the stationary train at Sydney's Central station on Monday at about 1pm when she was told by another passenger that a man had just used his phone to take two pictures.

The 30-year-old woman was alighting from a stationary train at Central Station, about 1 pm on Monday, when she learned the 46-year-old man had taken lewd photographs of her

The man was then arrested by officers from Central Police Transport Command, who seized his phone and found several other images of unknown victims

Police allege the victim then approached the 46-year-old man and demanded to see his phone and watched until he deleted the two images.

The man was then arrested and police seized his phone and charged him with two counts of filming a person's private parts.

Police located several other images and videos of unknowning female victims.

The mobile phone will be used as forensic evidence in an ongoing investigation.

The man was granted conditional bail to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 15 October.

Inquiries into the incidents continue.

The 46-years-old man will appear at the Downing Centre Local Court in October, facing two counts of filming a persons private parts
