A heartwarming picture of a former San Diego Marine who lost his legs to an IED in Afghanistan being carried by his wife has touched tens of thousands of people on Facebook.

Six years after he joined the Marine Corps in 2003, Jesse Cottle was dismantling an explosive device during a deployment when it went off, leaving him a double amputee.

But despite his debilitating injuries, he met his beautiful wife Kelly, a swimmer for Boise State, during a competitive meet in San Diego soon after he arrived home, and the pair married a year ago.

The touching photograph of the couple was taken recently while they visited her family in Idaho.

'I was awake the whole time,' said Jesse to KTVB.Com about the aftermath of the detonation which ended his active service career.

'It was tough and it is tough in general, but I just kind of always had the attitude that it's really tough now but things will just be okay, and I had my family around me I had good friends and basically just my faith really helped me to carry me through,' he said.

'I was lucky to be able to go through the tough recovery, and then still live my life, and meet my beautiful wife.'

Indeed, Jesse met Kelly while she was a swimmer for Boise State during a competitive meet in San Diego.

'I
just remember being very intrigued by him,' said Kelly. 'He was just 
very different and not just because of his legs, just who he was.'

The much-shared photo came during a recent visit to Kelly's parents in Idaho and happened very spontaneously.

'It was a normal photo shoot, we finally got together and Jessie had his prosthetic legs on and everything,' said Kelly.

It was then that photographer Sarah Ledford suggested that the family get into the water for a portrait.

'So we said 'well, you can just pop off your legs and get on one of our backs and we'll take you in' and so, 'cause that's just how we get around sometimes, like at the beach,' said Kelly to KTVB.Com.

'It's just pretty normal, so he hopped back on my back and then Sarah's like 'oh, we'll take some couples shots.'

After the pictures were taken, Ledford posted the wonderful image of Kelly carrying Jesse onto Facebook and the response was phenomenal.

'Overwhelming, I can't even keep up with my page,' said Ledford. 'The picture just blew up, America just fell in love with Jesse and Kelly.'

With thousands of shares and hundreds of likes, commentators on Facebook have been inspired.

'God bless the both of you and thank you tremendously for your sacrifice for our freedom, you are a hero.'

Jesse said that the support he and his wife received has been incredible to witness.

'I'm glad that we can have that impact, but you don't expect it,' he said.

'But it's cool because we represent a lot of people, couples that are going through the same thing and so it's just an honor to be able to represent that,' said Kelly.
