A young Australian chef found beaten to death in a garage allegedly had links to an underworld drug scene.

Peter Milos, 26, was found dead in a room inside a garage at Morningside in Brisbane on Tuesday afternoon.

The chef, who had once co-owned a fine-dining Brisbane restaurant, had been kicked out of his Fortitude Valley apartment in February after police raided it when they suspected him of dealing drugs at a music festival, the Courier Mail reports.

His landlord threw him out following the raid and a fight that took place in building where Mr Milos allegedly attacked a man with a metal bar.

Police visited the apartment on Wednesday to ask neighbours about the alleged attack and people who may have visited the apartment while Mr Milos was living there.

Mr Milos and his brother Daniel owned popular restaurant Mariosarti and had been photographed with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.

His older brother Allen was arrested on drug related charges last year and is serving 13 years in jail.

Mr Milos left his position at the restaurant at the beginning of 2013 to take time off to write a cookbook, according to his brother Daniel.

His said he would be shocked if police focused on drugs in their investigations surrounding Mr Milos' death.

'He is no big drug kingpin. Everything he owns is in a tiny little bedroom,' Daniel told the Courier Mail.

'They can look all they want. My brother hardly has a penny to his name.'

Mr Milos took to Facebook to say he was 'starting again' just days before his death, according to the Brisbane Times.

Last month he alluded to life troubles when he posted: 'Now I’ll see who my real friends really are'.

Police are treating Mr Milos' death as suspicious but have no suspects yet.
