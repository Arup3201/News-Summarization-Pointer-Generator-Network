A parenting magazine editor has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover.

Ariel Gore, who has edited Hip Mama for 20 years, selected a powerful cover photo for the summer issue showing a topless mother in a Spider-Man mask nursing her toddler son.

'I thought the image invoked the 
unrealistic notion of the "Supermom" who can do everything and countered
 it with the vulnerability of being partially naked with a small child,' she wrote on the Huffington Post.

Too much? Ariel Gore, the editor of parenting magazine Hip Mama, has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover (pictured)

But when she posted the cover on her Facebook in the lead-up to the issue's release, some people took issue with the picture, claiming it was too indecent to line the shelves of magazine vendors.

Facebook censors even attempted to remove the photo from Ms Gore's timeline, despite the fact that she had previously posted a Cosmopolitan cover with a much more visible nipple, and there was no backlash at all.

'I was left to assume that it's the breastfeeding that some people find offensive,' she wrote.

The photo is a self-portrait by artist Ana Alvarez-Errecalde, who said its aim was to show the unique relationship between mother and child, 'where each being is complete by themselves but they are reinvented and strengthened by the relationships they establish with each other.'

Compromise: Ms Gore was forced to produce two versions - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores, and one for vendors that had a red dot over the woman's nipple (pictured)

But vendors refused to see it that way. One distributor explained her reasoning to Ms Gore, telling her: 'This isn't Europe. Open breastfeeding is not okay.'

Others asserted that it wasn't the act of breastfeeding that was offensive, it was the fact that the child pictured is four, which is generally considered by Americans as too old to be nursing.

But Ms Gore
 feels that this belief is a product of our society's 'squeamish' 
attitude towards breastfeeding in general, since the average worldwide 
weaning age is between two-and-a-half and four-and- a-half.

Unfair attitude: 'Nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places,' said Ms Gore (pictured)

By contrast, the average age a child is weaned off of breastfeeding in America is three months. 'American attitudes about breasts and breastfeeding have to be at least partially to blame,' she wrote.

In any case, Ms Gore was forced to produce two versions of the magazine - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores, and one for vendors that had a red dot strategically placed over the woman's nipple.

Even though she says she 'didn't want even to entertain the ridiculous suggestion that it was in any way obscene,' ultimately she decided that a censored issue was better than no issue at all.

What's more, she hopes the photo and the controversy it ignited will help start a larger conversation.

'Right now this is about an image of an artist breastfeeding on the cover of a magazine,' she wrote.

'But nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places.'

The two versions of Hit Mama's summer issue were released on Mother's Day.
