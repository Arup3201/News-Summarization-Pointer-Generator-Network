More than 80 lobbyists have been suspended from the Palace of Westminster in a dramatic attempt to end the latest sleaze scandal.

Commons Speaker John Bercow said scores of parliamentary passes are being investigated amid fears they have been used by private firms to gain access to politicians.

He promised 'urgent and effective action' over the politicians-for-hire controversy.

Commons Speaker John Bercow has suspended 80 lobbyists from the Palace of Westminster

The 83 passholders are connected to 
all-party parliamentary groups, which act as 'special interest' talking 
shops but have faced criticism for being a backdoor for lobbyists. 
Around half of these individuals are linked to lobbying firms.

In a statement to the Commons Mr Bercow said today: 'As Speaker I have long felt that the operation of all party parliamentary groups needed to be improved to meet the high expectations of transparency and accountability required in public life.

'Recent events have heightened my concern and underlined the need for urgent and effective action.'

More than 100 lobbying professionals are believed to have been handed parliamentary passes by members of the House of Lords. This gives them the right to roam the parliamentary estate unsupervised.

Some 120 out of 660 people working for peers have also declared they are consultants or lobbyists for businesses and charities.

At the same time, Downing Street announced that legislation for a statutory register of lobbyists would be rushed out next month. The new law will also strike directly at the ability of the trade unions to ramp up Labour's campaign machine in the run-up to the general election.

It will also require unions to comply with potentially costly new regulations to ensure the membership lists they use for strike ballots are up to date.

Ministers conceded that the statutory register of lobbyists – first promised three years ago – would not have prevented the latest scandal.

Proposals to allow voters to 'recall' disgraced MPs will not be published until at least next year, meaning that dodgy MPs are highly unlikely to get kicked out before the next election.

Downing Street said the proposals were part of a 'transparency agenda' to give the public more information about the impact of lobbying.

A source said the 'modest' union reforms were simply designed to ensure strike ballots were valid and to close loopholes in the law that have enabled the unions to get round the £19million cap on party spending in election year.

But Labour and the trade unions reacted furiously. A senior Labour source described the proposals as a 'shabby and panicked' response to the latest lobbying scandal.

The proposals on trade union reform also appeared to catch the Liberal Democrats off guard. Deputy Commons Leader Tom Brake, who is technically in charge of the lobbying legislation, said the idea of a union clampdown was 'premature' when he was quizzed about the plans shortly after they were announced by Number 10.

A Lib Dem source said the details of the proposed union crackdown had 'yet to be agreed' within the Coalition.

Yesterday's move followed a fresh  round of lobbying scandals, which saw Conservative MP Patrick Mercer and an Ulster Unionist peer resigning the party whip and two Labour peers suspended after it was alleged  that they had breached parliamentary rules.

Lord Hill, the Leader of the Upper House, said an investigation would be launched into the 'very serious and distressing' allegations of sleaze against Ulster Unionist Lord Laird, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Cunningham and fellow Labour peer Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate.

The three, who all deny any wrongdoing and referred themselves to the standards watchdog, were caught in an undercover sting by Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists working for a fake energy firm.

Lord Laird was also targeted, with Mr Mercer, in a separate sting by journalists posing as lobbyists for the Fijian government. Mr Mercer, who referred himself to the Commons Standards Commissioner, is alleged to have been paid £4,000 by the bogus lobbying firm and tabled parliamentary questions and a motion, offered a security pass and set up an all-party parliamentary group on Fiji.

The Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said the register was only a small step in clearing up the 'stinking swamp' of Westminster sleaze.

He said: 'I regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in Africa. You use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito, which a statutory register would be, but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp, which is particularly the House of Lords, where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time.'

Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, last night said the union law was 'naked opportunism', adding: 'The Government is cynically trying to exploit a political sleaze scandal to crack down on unions – which are democratic and accountable organisations.'

But ministers believe the change will simply force the unions to  comply fully with the spending rules. They also hope it will shine  a light on Labour's dependency on union funding in the run-up to  the election.
