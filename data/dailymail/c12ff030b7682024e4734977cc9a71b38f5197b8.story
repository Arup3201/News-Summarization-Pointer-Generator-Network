CLICK HERE to see which English duo the Barcelona playmaker would have loved to have played with during his career

Barcelona playmaker Xavi believes his superstar team-mate Lionel Messi would be an even bigger hit in the Premier League than he has been in La Liga.

The 34-year-old, who has won an incredible seven La Liga titles and three Champions League crowns during his time at the club, believes the defensive philosophy in England would mean the 27-year-old would cause absolute havoc.

He told BBC Sport: 'I think he'd be even better in the Premier League because it is not so defensive.

'When defending against Barcelona, they [English clubs] play on a 1 v 1 basis, defending with passion, and a lot of energy. 

'But Leo would find more spaces than in La Liga.'

Despite these claims from Xavi, it looks unlikely Messi will ever make the move to the Premier League, with the latter insisting on numerous occasions that he is happy to remain at Barcelona for the remainder of his career.

Few could argue Messi wouldn't have a similar impact to what his rival Cristiano Ronaldo had in England during his six-year stint at Manchester United if he ever made the move though, with the latter scoring over 100 goals in that time.

This season the Argentine forward has already notched 11 goals in 15 appearances for the Catalan giants, as they lie two points behind arch-rivals Real Madrid at the top of the table.

Messi is also on the verge of breaking yet another record later this month, as he seeks to better Raul's all-time Champions League goal haul (71 goals), after equalling it with a double in a 2-0 win against Ajax earlier this month.
