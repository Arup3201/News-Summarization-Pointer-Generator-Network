Homeowners have a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash job carried out by gardeners, cleaners and handymen, Ed Balls said yesterday.

The Shadow Chancellor said he always asked for a written record even if it was for £10 to trim a hedge – because it was the ‘right thing to do’.

His crackdown on cash-in-hand jobs was branded ‘completely out of touch’ yesterday as he extended Labour’s war on tax avoidance to ordinary families.

Ed Balls was accused of being 'completely out of touch' after claiming people had a duty to collect receipts from gardeners and cleaners

Mr Balls has vowed to clamp down on ‘tax planning’ by the middle classes, suggesting Labour could go even further if it wins power in May.

But pressed about what constitutes tax avoidance, he told the BBC: ‘The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.’ 

Asked if he followed this rule himself, he replied: ‘Absolutely. That’s because I am the Shadow Chancellor and I’m extremely careful about these things.

‘Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not been given a receipt for it? Probably yes.

But he said he had not done so ‘since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters’.

Tory MP Peter Bone said it was ‘ludicrous’ to expect people to collect receipts and personal information for minor work.

And he accused Labour of wrongly implying that all small businesses were trying to dodge taxes. ‘There are so many cash businesses,’ said the Wellingborough MP.

‘If you go into a cafe for a cup of tea you would not expect a receipt for it. If you were running a fish and chip shop you do not always give receipts. It shows a complete lack of understanding of business. Is he trying to imply that if you are a small business that deals in cash, you are trying to dodge tax?

‘I think it shows how completely out of touch he is with small business. There is an implication that everybody is out to fiddle their taxes. It is just wrong.’

Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt'

The row comes as a study reveals that paid work not declared to the taxman is worth an estimated £150billion a year, but is lower than most other western countries.

Britain’s so-called ‘black economy’ was equivalent to 10 per cent of national income in 2013, but half the level of cash-in-hand work in Italy, Greece and Spain. It was also lower than the 13.4 per cent average for all 34 leading nations in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Ed Balls today defended Labour's decision to accept a £1.65million donation in shares rather than cash as 'tax efficient' - despite hitting out at people avoiding paying their fair share.

Shopping channel tycoon John Mills made the donation 2013. But by giving the party shares instead of money it reduced the tax Mr Miliband's party had to pay.

Mr Balls, speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 live, said this was 'small beer compared with what the Tories are up to'.

He also insisted he didn't 'know the details of [the Mills donation] and it would be wrong for me to do so because as I think it is important that I can be objective on these matters.'

However, he insisted that David Cameron should have carried out a more comprehensive analysis of Lord Green, the former HSBC chairman, before he was made a minister.

Grant Shapps, the Tory Chairman, said that 'Labour say one thing on tax avoidance, but do another.'

'Last week Ed Miliband criticised the practice, but today Ed Balls has admitted that the Party accepts 'tax efficient' donations because they 'need the money,'' said Mr Shapps.

Free market think-tank the Institute for Economic Affairs, which carried out the study, found no evidence for a surge in undeclared work during the recession, adding that cash-in-hand work in the UK is at a lower level than in 1997-8 when it was equivalent to 13 per cent of national income.

In 2010, however, HMRC claimed that it missed out on £42billion in revenue because of tax fraud, avoidance and underpayment – £4 billion higher than the previous year. A survey last year found that four out of five families had paid a workman cash-in-hand during the previous 12 months.

Almost a third said they had done so three times or more.

Some 14 per cent said they would rather pay less money for a service by paying cash, even if they knew the tradesman was avoiding tax.Treasury minister David Gauke sparked controversy on the issue in 2012 after claiming it was ‘morally wrong’ to pay cash-in-hand.

Mr Gauke said making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was on a par with tax avoidance, which ministers have already called ‘morally repugnant’.

He added: ‘Getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the Revenue and means others must pay more in tax.’

Asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice, he said: ‘Yes, I think it’s morally wrong.’
