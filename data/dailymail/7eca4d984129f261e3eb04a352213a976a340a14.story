A baby girl who beat the odds of survival after nearly being shaken to death by her father, has been released from the hospital after a month.

Baby Cheyenne Rae suffered swelling and bleeding on her brain as well as a fractured skull after her 
father, James Davis Jr., angrily shook the little girl at the 
family's home in Wellford, South Carolina on August 17.

The nine-month old child has stunned doctors with her tenacity but still has a long way to go on her road to recovery.

After the father's vicious abuse, doctors didn't expect the baby to survive and prepared the family for the worst.

But after 30 days in the hospital and multiple surgeries, including an operation on her brain, the baby continues to keep fighting.

'She's a miracle, a miracle baby,' the little girl's grandfather, Danny Owensby, told WFIE-TV.

The baby is still on a feeding tube and suffers from swelling on the brain.

Cheyenne's story has captured the hearts of people the world over, with many pitching in to help cover medical costs and others showing their support for the girl with a Facebook page, that has already garnered over 74,000 likes.

While many are celebrating the girl's perseverance, her family is outraged over the senseless assault that nearly cost Cheyenne her life.

'This family’s life will be changed 
forever all because of a man who couldn’t control his temper ….Never 
shake a baby!!' the family said on the website they created for the 
girl, Prayers for Cheyenne, to raise awareness for Shaken Baby Syndrome.

After the traumatic operations and severe pain, the little girl is more and more responsive with her family.

'I sat down and talked to her, she giggled and smiled,' her grandfather told the local news station.

'She had just got home from the doctor, they said she has improved greatly. Every day she gets better and better.'

James Davis Jr. has been charged with child abuse for shaking his baby daughter

The baby's grandfather shared that he struggles to restrain his anger when he sees the tiny child in pain.

'Every
time you would walk in the room at the hospital, you'd get mad and 
madder and try to keep your head,' Owensby said.

The 28-year-old father was arrested 
after the incident and has been charged with unlawfully inflicting great
bodily harm to an infant.

He remains in jail.

The girl's mother, Amy Owensby, has stayed by her baby's side in the hospital and been updating friends and family with regular updates to her Facebook page and website Prayers for Cheyenne.

'Cheyenne sat up for a few seconds by herself!!' the proud and optimistic mother wrote to followers of her Facebook page.

'Nothing will hold my angel back ...Only two months till she's ONE, seriously?! Gotta start planning her huge party. ;) November 17th,' she added.
