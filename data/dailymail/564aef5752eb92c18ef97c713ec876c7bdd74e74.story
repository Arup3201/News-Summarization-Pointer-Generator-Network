Two anti-Heathrow campaigners sent 8,000 noise complaints to the airport - with some arriving one hour before the aircraft was due to take off.

The duo were using automated software to complain when a flight was due to fly over their homes near the airport. 

But officials at the airport caught them out when they failed to take into account the clocks going back in October leading to complaints being made about flights which were still on the ground.

The airport now believes that dozens of complainants are using similar software to generate automatic email complaints when a plane was due regardless of the noise.

Two anti-Heathrow campaigners were discovered using an automated email system to complain about aircraft noise after they failed to change their clocks in October - meaning the emails were sent an hour early

According to airport officials, two individuals were responsible for 7,888 complaints in 2014. The airport claims that just 37 people using the automated email system have lodged more than 28,000 complaints. 

The airport has seen the total number of noise complaints rise from 18,826 in 2013 to 94,114 last year. 

A spokesman said: 'We found out because when the clocks went back in October, they forgot to change the timing on their software, so we started receiving complaints exactly one hour before the plane took off.'

However, John Stewart of the HACAN group which campaigns for noise reduction around Heathrow said: 'I think its unfortunate that many residents felt they had to resort to these kinds of machines, but unfortunately they have been left with no choice but to have them.

'I think that shows how disturbed people were by the noise from the flight paths. But unfortunately they have set their automatic machines to send out complaints before the aircraft even arrive.

'It is not something that we were aware of ourselves and I do have some sympathy with Heathrow. I think they were right to point this out, and I do think they recognise there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.' 

It comes as a government survey found the number of people disturbed by aircraft noise doubled in the last decade.

DEFRA, the Government department responsible for noise, said four per cent of the population - over 2 million people - now consider themselves badly affected by noise from aircraft.

Another nine per cent said they are ‘moderately’ affected.
