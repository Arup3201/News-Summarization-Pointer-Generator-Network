Domestic abusers are using secret apps hidden on their partner's phones and computers to keep track of what they are doing.

The technology turns a smart phone into a high-tech spying device allowing remote access to the handset. The attackers are able to keep track of the phone owner's current location. The abuser is also able to remotely switch on the phone's microphone and listen in to anything within earshot of the handset.

A Danish citizen was last month fined  $500,000 by federal judges in the United States after he admitted advertising and selling his StealthGenie spyware app.

Spyware users can easily  log onto the internet and monitor the victim's phone without their knowledge

However, a British company is currently marketing its own spyware app for £30 which works on Android phones. 

The software, which cannot be detected by the casual user, turns the average smartphone into a powerful surveillance platform. 

A survey by Women's Aid discovered that 41 per cent of domestic violence victims had been subjected to some form of illicit electronic surveillance. 

Some abusive spouses will even install spyware software on Christmas presents for their children to find out what was happening inside their victim's phone. 

Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid told The Independent: 'Domestic abuse is about control and perpetrators will use any means available to maintain and increase their control. 

'We increasingly hear stories of abusers adding tracking software to phones, placing spyware on personal computers and using the internet to gather information on their partner. 

'However, in many cases the police are not trained to recognise and understand the impact of online abuse, including tracking, and action is rarely taken against the abusers.' 

The FBI busted one of the biggest spyware operators following a raid in Los Angeles in September.

The bureau arrested Hammad Akbar, chief executive of InvoCode Pvt, who developed and sold the StealthGenie app. 

Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the US Justice Department said: 'Spyware is an electronic eavesdropping tool that secretly and illegally invades individual privacy.'

StealthGenie was available across the globe and claimed people could spy on a phone in just five minutes

Leslie Caldwell, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'Selling spyware is not just reprehensible, it's a crime.

'Apps like StealthGenie are expressly designed for use by stalkers and domestic abusers who want to know every detail of a victim's personal life – all without the victim's knowledge. The Criminal Division is committed to cracking down on those who seek to profit from technology designed and used to commit brazen invasions of individual privacy.'

'StealthGenie has little use beyond invading a victim's privacy' said U.S. Attorney Boente. 'Advertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners.' 

According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): ' The purchaser can review information transferred from the target mobile phone via an online portal. These intercepted communications are stored on the StealthGenie website. For example, a purchaser can log-in to the online portal to access information pulled from the user's phone such as messages, e-mail, photos, and phone calls.

'Mobile device spyware apps are developed and advertised as being invisible to targets and act in an undetectable manner. For example, an app can be installed to look like another type of app or file, such as a digital photo application. 

'Therefore, it will be difficult for the non-expert user to determine whether or not spyware is on his or her phone.'
