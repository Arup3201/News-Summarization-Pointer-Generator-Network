Britain's smallest home, which is less than half the size of a train carriage and measures just 188sq.ft, has sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds.

The pint-sized property in Islington, north London, is a fifth of the size of the average new build but still crams in an open-plan kitchen, living area, bathroom and bedroom.

Described by estate agents as 'unique', the cosy home – which has its front door underneath the bed – went on sale for £275,000 last month and has now been snapped up after receiving an astonishing amount of interest.

The pint-sized property in Islington, north London, is a fifth of the size of the average new build but still crams in an open-plan kitchen, a tiny living area, a bathroom and 'bedroom'. It has been sold for in the region of £270,000 and gained interest from thousands of people

The bedroom, which is suspended above the front door, measures just 7ft 7ins xby 5ft 8ins in size but does come with storage space

The property, which is a converted flower shop and boasts some plants outside the front door, is on the highly sought-after Richmond Avenue, just one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent. It is nestled between two several-storey houses

More than 220,000 people viewed the property's advert on Rightmove and Zoopla and, after a flurry of enquiries and a number of offers, the converted flower shop was sold.

Hamish Allan, from estate agency Winkworth, said: 'We had lots of interest from a broad range of potential buyers.

'There were first-time buyers, enquiries from people who wanted an extra or spare room and someone else who looked at buying it and putting it on AirBNB.

'It was only on for three weeks and we had a number of offers. The home is unique, there is no other way to describe it.

'It used to be a flower shop until the conversion. It is a really cleverly designed home and there is another bed which comes out but we can't call it a two-bed home.

'The typical properties we sell range between 1,400sq.ft and 2,200sq.ft and we have sold another one-bed which was 600sq.ft.

'But we've never sold anything this small. It has been a pleasure.'

The house's buyers will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before climbing up several steps to make it into the 'bedroom'

Hamish Allan, from  Winkworth, said: 'The home is unique, there is no other way to describe it. We've never sold anything this small'

The bathroom is the only separate room in the property, even though it is barely large enough to fit a lavatory and a shower

The property's new owners will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before balancing on narrow steps, to make it to the 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins airborne 'bedroom'.

The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space.

The house is on the highly sought-after Richmond Avenue, one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent.

Blair sold that house for £615,000 in 1997 but it is now worth more than £3million.

The new owners will now brush shoulders with Hi-de-Hi! actress Su Pollard, who lives on the same street.  

While Winkworth wouldn't confirm the exact agreed sale price or the buyers, the property had been put on the market for £275,000 - £100,000 more than the average price people paid for a home in England and Wales last month, according to the Land Registry.

The Office of National Statistics said the average current value of a home in the UK is £275,000.

Lawrence Hall, from Zoopla, said the tiny home has been one of the most viewed houses on the property website this year.

He said: 'As a nation we have an obsession with property, but when it comes to the biggest, smallest, most expensive or cheapest properties we really see these being shared in huge volumes.

'We saw similar figures when the couple from Gogglebox put their 8 bedroom mansion on the market earlier this year.'

The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space and a rather high ceiling

The property was put on the market for £275,000 - £100,000 more than the average price people pay for a home in England and Wales

Guinness World Records currently recognise a house in Conwy, north Wales, as Britain's smallest house.

The house, aptly called The Smallest House in Great Britain, is just 10ft tall and has two rooms.

It can only fit four people at a time and it around 6ft wide, but thousands of tourists still pay the £1 (50p for children) fee to enter the cramped, red house every year.

It was occupied for about 200 years until local fisherman Robert Jones, who was 6ft 3ins tall, moved out in 1900.

Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters the world over.

She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year. That means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer.'
