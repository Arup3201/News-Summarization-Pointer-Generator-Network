Victoria police have revealed their romantic side in their search for the owner of a lost wedding ring.

The silver wedding band, inscribed with the words 'I love Julie' and a date in 2005, was found on a nature strip in Glen Waverly, south-east of Melbourne.

Officers have made it their mission to find the love-struck ring owner after the jewellery piece was handed in to them by a member of the public last week.

'Glen Waverley police are hoping that love is not lost – even though the ring appears to be,' a spokesperson wrote in a media release aimed at hunting down the former-wearer.

'The ring is silver with a single diamond and appears to be a man's wedding ring judging by the size.'

Social media users responded by predicting how the ring ended up in the field and what consequences the owner might face when discovered by the mysterious Julie.

'Coming soon: "Glen Waverly male found assaulted for losing wedding ring. Police wish to speak with Julie",' Michael Jon Ovcaric commented on the post.

'She probably cheated on him so he threw it out... Or he could of been drunk and threw it out the window?' Pasi Julian Levae guessed.

Victoria police are asking anyone who believes they own the ring or knows who it might belong to to call Glen Waverley police station on 9566 1555.
