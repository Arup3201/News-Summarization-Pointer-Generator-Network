With her flawless skin, soft smoky eyes and rouge lips, Amal Clooney was the epitome of Hollywood glamour at the Golden Globes on Sunday.

Amal, 36, dazzled in a black custom Dior gown with cross-shoulder train and elbow-length gloves, in a look reminiscent of screen legend Audrey Hepburn. 

The human rights lawyer, who is married to Hollywood stalwart George Clooney, called on the best beauty buff in the business to make her over for the awards - and FEMAIL has the step-by-step guide to creating her look at home.

Amal called on Charlotte Tilbury, who also works with Kate Moss, Kim Kardashian and Cara Delevingne, to get red carpet-ready. 

Speaking about working with the star, Charlotte said: 'Amal knows and loves my products - she wears my Matte Revolution Lipsticks in Walk of Shame, Bond Girl and Amazing Grace. 

'I went into knowing what she likes, so I created a retro beauty look inspired by the silver screen sirens that fits her classic style.' 

This isn't the first time the pair have worked together; Charlotte gave Amal her bridal beauty look when she tied the knot with George in September last year. 

Want to emulate Amal? Charlotte shared her step-by-step guide to getting the look using her own product range, which is loved by a plethora of A-listers.

Charlotte started by prepping the top lawyer's skin with one of her new and soon-to-be-released products: the Goddess Skin Clay Mask, which she used to create a 'veil of perfection' on the skin.

Speaking about creating Amal's make-up, Charlotte said: 'I went into today knowing what she likes, so I created a retro beauty look inspired by the silver screen sirens that fits her classic style'

Charlotte then applied her Magic Cream -  named by the supermodels backstage at Fashion Week - to the entire face followed by her Wonderglow to create a flawless soft focus and an instant 'spotlight' effect, which acted as the perfect base to foundation.

She concealed any dark circles with her retoucher concealer and rid the face of any unwanted oils with a dusting of her powder down the middle of the face only to keep Amal’s skin dewy and fresh.

Next, she used her Brow Lift in Cara D - named by none other than her close friend and brow queen, Cara Delevingne - to perfect Amal's brows and shape the face.

To bring out the golden highlights in Amal’s eyes, Charlotte applied the glittery 'pop' shade from her Luxury Palette in The Dolce Vita across the lids. 

Eyeliner was applied around the eye and to soften the liner followed by three coats of mascara to the top lashes and only one coat to bottom lashes to create an open-eyed look.

To add an unbeatable red carpet-worthy glow, she used her popular Filmstar Bronze & Glow to highlight and sculpt the cheeks, nose, jawline and temples. Khloe Kardashian also used this ahead of her red carpet appearance at a party over the weekend.

To create perfectly dewy cheeks, Charlotte used both Cheek to Chic in Love Glow and First Love across the cheekbones.

She completed the look with a velvety-looking red lip by using Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Savage Rose along with a mixture of Charlotte Tilbury K.I.S.S.I.N.G. Lipstick in Night Crimson and Matte Revolution Lipstick in Red Carpet Red.

Finally, she applied her Multi-Miracle Glow, £45, for moisture and a dewy finish followed by her Supermodel Body to sculpt and illuminate the limbs. 

Kim Kardashian, 33, famed for her curves, also uses the £45 product to define and enhance her legs.

Speaking about the lotion, which is described as the perfect way to cheat your dream body without the workout, Kim said: 'It's legendary! I used it on my legs.' 

Make-up maestro Charlotte said of the product: 'I have poured all my make-up artist know-how into creating this incredible slimmer shimmer that acts like shapewear lingerie for the skin.'

The product is enriched with FermiProtect, a wild shitake extract that protects the collagen fibres in the skin, aiming to make the skin look and feel firmer, toned and supple, to create the contouring effect.

It also contains precious metal highlighter mix to recreate Charlotte's secret 'celebrity limb trick' - the technique whereby she highlights along the centre of legs and arms to create the illusion of leaner, longer limbs.

The product also contains  caffeine, which promises to detox the skin tissues, reduce unevenness in the skin and any bloated puffiness, while menthol works to promote micro-circulation and blood-flow.

'It's easy body make-up in a minute,' adds Charlotte, who applies it by twisting the applicator and rolling the cooling-metal massager down the centre of limbs to  promote lymphatic drainage, then blends out with her hands.

Charlotte added: 'Any stylist will tell you that wearing black slims, streamlines and contours, but white widens. They’re basic laws of art, photography and make-up artistry. I always use the same principles when body contouring.

'You can elongate and slim by highlighting down the centre, and shading at the edges. I’ve using this trick on the glorious angels of the runway and stars on the red carpet for years.' 

It certainly worked wonders on Amal. As a modern day power woman who battles in world-changing human rights cases by day and wears Valentino by night, this Golden Globes appearance is another style triumph for the impossibly elegant star.
