Governors in charge of the secondary school at the centre of the Trojan Horse scandal have been told they are not doing enough to combat extremism.

The damning indictment of Park View Academy in Birmingham follows allegations that children are being taught lessons in holy war.

A report set to be published by Ofsed next week has also accused the school of failing to warn its pupils about conservative ideals.

Damning: Park View School in Birmingham has been condemned for not doing enough to combat extremism and will be condemned for not doing enough to protect pupils in a report set to be published next week

The school was previously rated as outstanding by the education watchdog, but will be downgraded to inadequate next week after a string of allegations condemning the way it is run.

The publication, leaked to The Guardian, is set to be released on Monday and criticses the school of failing to train staff in anti-extremism.

It is among six institutions in the area expected to be given the lowest possible rating next week when the findings of investigations into 21 Birmingham schools are published.

One of the allegations is that external speakers, who are invited to run Islamic-themed assemblies, are not vetted properly.

Another is that sex education classes are ineffective and do not do enough to tackle bullying.

The report will recommend that the school's management must 'urgently improve systems for safeguarding students' through the use of the Home Office's anti-extremism policy, Prevent.

Last night, it was revealed the school’s website describes how a 
lesson is devoted to jihad under a section on ‘Living The Muslim Life’.

Pupils study topics such as ‘what is a just war?’, ‘when can Muslims 
take up arms?’ and ‘conditions of jihad’.

Rules: Staff at the school have been accused of imposing strict policies on pupils such as segregated classrooms and strict dress codes

The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, will address the Commons on Monday – after Ofsted has released the results of its three-month probe.

It follows an alleged row between Mr Gove and Theresa May following accusations the Home Office was not doing enough to combat extremism in schools.

Last night, Governors at Saltley 
School, another school embroiled in the plot, were accused of spending ‘substantial amounts 
of money with no obvious benefit’ including on consultants and lawyers.

In the report, they were also accused of paying private detectives to snoop on staff's private emails while other faculty members complained to inspectors they were ‘treated unequally because of their beliefs, religion or background.'

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, 
will highlight a series of concerns about practices in some of the 
schools, including unequal treatment of boys and girls, a narrow 
curriculum that denies pupils a rounded education and governors intent 
on changing the character of schools.

Park View has rejected the findings, 
along with negative coverage in the media, which came as a result of the
 Trojan horse letter.

It 
said the school had been subject of an attempted takeover by Muslim 
conservatives, who were accused of imposing policies such as segregation
 in classrooms and strict dress codes.
