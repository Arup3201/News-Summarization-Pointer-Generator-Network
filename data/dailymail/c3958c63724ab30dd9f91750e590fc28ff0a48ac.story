Many people avoid their work Christmas party like the plague but the reality is a lot of relationships can begin in the office environment.

So if you're single and looking for love - instead of making excuses to not turn up to your work breakup party or plan to leave early to meet up with your mates - why not see it as an opportunity to not only strengthen relationships with co-workers, but potentially meet ‘the one’?

Interestingly, online dating site eHarmony reveals over two thirds of Aussies feel the qualities that make for lasting romantic relationships, such as humour and emotional support, are similar to those that make for strong bonds with colleagues – suggesting workmates could make for ideal partners.

However, there is no room for excuses the morning after, with poor performance (66 per cent) listed as the biggest workplace irritation. 

With company parties in full swing, the research finds 75 per cent of Aussies agree that being flirtatious or drinking at work events won’t damage relationships with their peers. 

Daily Mail Australia speaks to psychologist and eHarmony dating and relationship expert, Melanie Schilling, about tips on what you can do capitalise on making the most of your work Christmas party this year and maybe even going home with a few phone numbers.

REVEAL A NEW SIDE OF YOURSELF: 

'You need to think that you are already in a reasonably good pool to fish in if you like because there is the similarities that have drawn us together in the workplace.'

'So there's an opportunity to start representing a slightly different version of yourself for example a lot of people reserve aspects of themself for the weekend from really practical things - like the way they dress to their interests and passions - that you might like to experiment with and bring out at the party to show a different side of yourself.'

DON'T JUST TALK SHOP ALL NIGHT

'Don't just focus on networking - rather than just talk about work start experimenting a little bit with questions that might bring out the person.'

'If you are someone that family is really important to you put in a few questions about how they will be spending Christmas with their family and finding that commonality there.'

DRINK TO RELAX NOT TO DISGRACE: 

'Also alcohol can be involved so defenses can be a little bit down so there is that fine line to walk.'

'It's great to be able to open up and be a different version of yourself but I guess the word of caution there is to keep in mind that any HR policies that are in place in the workplace still relate to the party.' 

'That's the tricky bit because boundaries and certain behaviour and still apply. Put your flirty pants on but be aware of appropriate workplace behaviour.'

BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR:

'What is important to you or the things in your life - your values - so that when you are out there in that social world you can use that as a bit of criteria for screening people so you are not just responding to people who might be interested in you.'

'That way you are actually being quite proactive and empowered so you ask the right questions to determine whether you are interested in them.'

1. Approach the festive season with a new mindset – swap your cocktail small talk for some subtle values exploration and keep an eye out for who makes you laugh

2. Network, network, network – use your networking skills to not only build your professional relationships but also explore potential dates. Perhaps your colleague can introduce you to someone in their network?

3. Showcase your assets – it’s a great opportunity to show a side of yourself you don’t typically display at work. Highlight a favourite part of yourself, wear something you feel confident in, and show a side of your personality usually reserved for the weekends

4. Watch the alcohol – remember that the Christmas Spirit can diminish your usual social filters and you don’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness at the office

5. Know the HR policy – work parties are an extension of the workplace and although there is often some leeway, all workplace policies apply

Try to strike up non-work conversations with colleagues to see if there are any similar interests
