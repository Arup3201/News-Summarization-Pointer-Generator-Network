Rory McIlroy earned his father a huge payout on Sunday afternoon as the Northern Irishman was crowned the 2014 Open champion.

In 2004, McIlroy's father, Gerry, placed a £200 bet on his son to win The Open within 10 years with odds of 500/1 at the time.

The winning bet meant Gerry not only got to witness his son take home the Claret Jug in style on Sunday, he will also be the happy recipient of £100,000.

Gerry also got two of his friends to make similar bets and they will now walk away with £80,000 in winnings from Ladbrokes.

Speaking
 about the bet struck by his father and two friends, he added: 'I don't 
think it matters so much to my dad anymore but the team-mates he did it 
with, I think they're a little happier.

'Hopefully the bet still stands. I'm not quite sure but if it does then that'd be great.'

Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes revealed McIlroy's win is the 'most expensive' Open result since 2006.

She said: 'As the family celebrations get underway there'll be an extra bottle or two of bubbly courtesy of the bookies.

'This
 is the most expensive Open result since Tiger's heyday in 2006 but 
although we're facing heavy losses we can't help but admire the 
foresight of Rory's dad and his pals a decade ago.'

The 25-year-old is now the even money favourite to collect the BBC Sport Personality of the Year award.
