Nellie the elephant packed her trunk - and took a 70mph trip down the motorway.

Stunned drivers had to do a double take as they spotted an elephant bearing down on them in their rear view mirrors.

Thankfully the unusual sight wasn't the real deal. This jumbo went flying past them near Heathrow Airport.

Drivers got a bit of a shock when they saw a model elephant flying past them in the middle lane of the M4 motorway near Heathrow Airport

This truck had a larger-than-life trunk on the M4

The colourful papier-mâché creation was spotted strapped down to the back of a flat-bed truck on the M4.

Nobody knew where the elephant, decorated with intricate painted flowers, was heading.

But it's probably safe to say she wasn't about to slip her chains and trundle off to the jungle.

One driver said: 'I looked in my rear view mirror and Dumbo was bearing down on me - I nearly crashed.'

The jumbo model was last seen heading towards Heathrow - jungle-bound?
