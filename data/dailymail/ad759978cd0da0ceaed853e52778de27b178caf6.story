A 10th grade english teacher at a Houston high school has managed to avoid going to prison despite admitting to having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student.

Nikki Scherwitz, 25, pleaded guilty to having an inappropriate relationship with a student and was sentenced to 10 years probation.

She was also fined $5,000, KHOU reported.

Scherwitz resigned from her job at Brazosport High School last year when she was questioned about the relationship.

Nikki Scherwitz, who taught 10th Grade English at Brazosport High School, Houston, was charged with sexual assault of a child and improper relationship with a student. She pleaded guilty and has been placed on 10 years probation. She will never teach again

Scherwitz wrote letters of apologies to the boy's mother and the district, admitting her guilt

According to KHOU.com, authorities were tipped off after Scherwitz turned up to an after-prom party on April 20 at a student's house.

One of the students who was at the party told the TV station: 'She was wearing no shoes when she showed up…like a cut up, cut off shirt and everything.'

She is also believed to have been drinking.

Another student told her it wasn't right for her to be there and asked her to leave. She and the 16-year-old student then allegedly left together.

Some students were shocked when they learned she got probation.

'The men get 25 to life, but a woman gets a slap on the wrist with only a $5,000 fine,' said Mario Salinas, a student at Brazosport High School.

'If it was a guy, a male teacher with a female student, it wouldn’t be the same,' agreed Oscar Guttierrez, another student.

Prosecutors said they agreed to the plea deal because the student was nearly 17 and Sherwitz agree to send apologies to the mother and the district.

In that letter she said: "I apologize for the behavior I engaged in with a student. I crossed an ethical boundary I never should have crossed. I’m sorry."

'I think she should get more than just probation because that’s a kid,' said Robert Anderson whose grandchild attends the school.

'I think she should get more than just probation because that’s a kid and you shouldn’t have relationships with a young minor.'

Scherwitz has been ordered to stay away from minors and she won’t be allowed to ever teach again.
