Michelle Obama really is pulling out all the stops to hammer home her healthy eating message.

In an rather awkward attempt to connect with kids, the first lady has posted a bizarre rap video showing herself dancing with a turnip. 

While bopping along to Lil Jon's 'Turn Down for What?' Michelle gives the rap lyrics a vegetable-inspired twist to fit her healthy eating message.

In an rather awkward attempt to connect with kids, the first lady has posted a bizarre rap video showing herself dancing with a turnip

She holds a turnip up to the camera and says 'Turnip for what?' before the music from takes off and Michelle bops along to the urban beats.

The short video was posted to The White House's official Vine website and quickly went viral.

The First Lady's cringeworthy video was a response to a question asked by Barak Obama impersonator Imman Crosson.

She was taking part in a Q&A on Vine to promote her Let's Move! campaign when she was  how many calories she burns 'when you turn up'.

Michelle's Let's Move! initiative is designed to tackle the problem of childhood obesity by encouraging families to exercise more and eat healthily.

Aside from rap videos, the first lady held a White House harvest this week. Michelle was joined by schoolchildren in the White House Kitchen Garden to harvest lettuce, bell peppers, sweet potatoes and tomatoes.

The children from Arizona, California, Ohio and the District of Columbia all attend schools that have school gardens, teach nutrition education or have 'farm to table' programs that use local food in school meals. 

'It's beautiful,' the first lady said, as she marveled the garden before they started digging. 'And just imagine that everything was just dirt just a few months ago. And because the summer was so cool and wet and beautiful, everything is just bursting.'

After the hard labor, the children joined White House chefs in preparing a late lunch in the East Room.

Mrs Obama toasted the students with a glass of water before they dined on pumpkin-sweet potato soup and chicken with ratatouille.

The first lady planted the vegetable garden in 2009, a year before she began her Let's Move! initiative
