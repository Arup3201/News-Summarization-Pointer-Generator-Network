The father of a missing two-year-old girl who claimed she was kidnapped in a carjacking, has reportedly failed a lie detector test.

Deandre Lane told Detroit police two men forced him out of his car at gunpoint and then drove off with little Bianca Jones strapped into her seat.

The vehicle was found abandoned 10 minutes later, less than a mile from where it had been stolen, but the child had vanished.

Missing: Little Bianca Jones who was strapped into her seat when the alleged carjackers drover off with her

Over 70 officers searched empty homes in the area after his silver Mercury Grand Marquis was discovered at Beaubien and Philadelphia. They used a tracker dog, but no trace was found of the carjackers.

Suspect: A sketch of one of the carjackers

Lane said the men stole his car when he got out after they pointed to a problem with his taillight. He described one of them as black,
6ft tall, 185 pounds, wearing a black top and black trousers, with a 
moustache and unshaven.

A sketch has been released as the hunt for Bianca was joined by FBI officers and Michigan state police.

Bianca was last seen wearing a purple jacket with 
gold trim, pink tights and pink shoes.

Her sister, seven-year-old Bella,
burst into tears as she begged for her sibling's safe return.

'I just want you to bring my sister back 
home,' the girl said before turning to be embraced by her mother Banika and 
other family members at a press conference.

They appeared with Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee
Jr who announced an anonymous businessman had put up a $15,000 reward swelling the fund to $17,500.

Chief Godbee said Lane was being held on an outstanding warrant for an unrelated matter 'in another jurisdiction, but had cooperated while his story is being checked.

He would not name him as a suspect, nor comment on reports by Fox News he had failed a polygraph test.

Questioned: Bianca's father, centre, talks to investigators about the disappearance of his daughter

'We have no reason at this point to doubt the father's rendition of what has happened,' he said.

'Time is of the essence. Every minute that ticks without us knowing where Bianca is, it just gives me greater concern.'

'But it does not mitigate the fact we don't know where Bianca is. Issue one is find Bianca, get her home. Issue two is investigation.'

He asked for any witnesses to the alleged carjacking to come forward.

Chief Godbee said: 'If
you've seen her picture, seen that smile, if that does not move your 
heart to do the right thing  - as my grandmother would say, there's no 
'do right' in you.

Appeal: Bianca's mother Banika has pleaded for her to be brought back safe

'If you've seen something, say 
something. If
someone has Bianca and you are afraid of what will happen, I suggest 
you drop her off at a police precinct or a church or call me. I'll come 
out and pick her up.'

Bianca's mother Banika pleaded for her daughter to be dropped off somewhere safe.

'We only want Bianca back safe and sound,' she said. 'Just take her to a church or a drugstore. Please bring Bianca home.

'I keep thinking I'm going to wake up with her poking me with a straw, asking me for her fruit cup,'

The missing girl's uncle, Olando Jones, 20, recently attended a summit in Washington on youth violence prevention,.

He said: 'It's just never hit this close to home. When it really happens to your family, it takes on a whole new meaning.

'You want everyone to jump immediately to your help … I'm begging, please. If this was your child you would want someone to bring her home.'
