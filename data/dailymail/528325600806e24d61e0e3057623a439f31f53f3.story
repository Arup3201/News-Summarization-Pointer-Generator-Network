A mother-of-four said she thought she was going to die after a large snake crawled into her bed while she slept and bit her on the breast.

Caroline Griffin, 49, had no idea if the four foot snake was poisonous after it found its way beneath her duvet and sank its fangs into her chest while she slept at her home in Guardbridge, Fife.

Thankfully the creature was a harmless brown belly California kingsnake which had escaped from a neighbour's home six months earlier.

The single mother of two girls and two boys said she woke up after feeling an unusual movement beneath her sheets.

Throwing back the duvet, Ms Griffin saw the large snake resting on her chest and started to scream.

The snake then bit into her breast, leaving bruising and puncture marks.

Describing the incident, Ms Griffin told the Daily Record: 'I was about to get up to get the kids ready to go to school when I threw the duvet back and saw it sitting on my chest.'

'I thought the kids were playing some sort of trick on me at first. Then I saw it move and I got the fright of my life.

'As soon as I started to scream, it bit me on the breast. It was quite sore... I thought I was going to die.'

On the loose: The snake's owner Gareth Niven (pictured) said Hiss escaped from his tank six months ago. He thinks Hiss is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and Ms Griffin's properties

Painful: Caroline Griffin says she screamed and tried to sit up when she realised there was an animal in her bed. At this point the snake bit into her breast, leaving bruising and puncture marks

As she suffered no immediate sickness as a result of the bite, Ms Griffin asked her children Laura, 24, Michael, 21, Emily, 16 and DJ, 13, to take photographs of the snake and call the Scottish SPCA for assistance. She also told her neighbours what had happened.

News spread along the street and a short time later the snake's owner Gareth Niven, 21, arrived at her front door to collect it.

After calling Scottish SPCA to say Mr Niven had come forward, a driver for the animal charity 
turned his vehicle around and the job was cancelled.

Mr Niven said the snake, which he calls Hiss, had escaped from his tank six months earlier and is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and Ms Griffin's properties.

It is believed council workers who recently visited the abandoned house may have disturbed Hiss and caused him to move into Ms Griffin's home.

Help: As she suffered no immediate ill health as a result of the bite, Ms Griffin asked her children to take photographs of the snake and call the Scottish SPCA

Knowing full well that Hiss - like all kingsnakes - has no venom, Mr Niven simply scooped him up in an empty pillowcase and took him home.

Although Hiss seems more aggressive than usual, this is probably a result of hunger and the fact he has had to fend for himself for the last six months, Mr Niven said.

Despite there being no risk to Ms Griffin as a result of the bite, kingsnakes are constrictors and the reptile may have killed her had it wrapped itself around her neck.

Worryingly its not the first time Hiss has escaped from his tank.

During a previous bid for freedom, he was on the loose in the neighbourhood for two years.

Mr Niven even admitted the reptile is nicknamed 'Houdini' such is his ability to push his way out the enclosure.Â
