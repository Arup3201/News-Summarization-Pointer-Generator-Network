Hall hath no fury like a woman scorned, as Katie Price and former  Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace recently proved.

Over the past few days Katie and Aisleyne have unleashed a torrent of anger on social media towards the other women involved in their relationship woes.

Katie's husband Kieran Hayler cheated on the mother-of-five with two friends last year and Aisleyne's romance with David McIntosh ended in tears when he reconciled with his ex Kelly Brook.

Kati Price took to Twitter on New Year's Eve to wish her former friends Chrissy Thomas and Jane Pountney 's**t lives' and label them 'w****s' after they slept with Kieran but she ended  'Pricey is back'

Katie let fly yesterday with a series of messages on Twitter in which she expressed her wish that her former friends would have a 'sh*t life forever'.

Meanwhile, Aisleyne posted a picture on her Instagram account captioned, 'I don't take back, unlike "some" women', which is thought to be a thinly-veiled dig at model Kelly.

But it seems Katie and Aisleyne are not alone in turning their anger on the other women, rather than directing their anger at the men who caused them so much pain.

When David McIntosh's ex-girlfriend Sarah Harper gave an interview in which she said she and David had 'hooked up' while he was engaged to Kelly, Sarah alleged that Kelly sent her a series of unpleasant texts.

Similarly when former TOWIE hunk Mark Wright cheated on Lauren Goodger with Sam Faiers during the first season of the Essex-based reality show in 2010, both women flung abuse at each other on camera. 

Meanwhile in the US, The Real Housewives of Beverley Hills star Brandi Glanville’s former husband Eddie Cibrian left her for  LeAnn Rimes.

Brandi could not contain her vitriol for the country singer even admitting that at one point she thought she was going to ‘kill’ LeAnn for stealing the father of her two children.

So why is it that when a partner cheats or ditches us for someone else so many females blame the ‘other woman'?

Relationship expert Laura Yates says that it is a relatively common way of coping with a partner's betrayal.

She said: ‘Sometimes, when women desperately want to make things work with their partner and take them back after an episode of cheating, the way of coping and dealing with it can be to blame the other woman or women involved.

‘In their minds it helps them to try and justify the cheating when in reality, both people involved in the cheating are equally at fault - and particularly the one already in a committed relationship.

‘You can't forgive and take someone back yet still blame the other women. This isn't congruent with moving forwards. 

‘I think when it comes to moving on from cheating, if you do take the person back, you have to fully commit to moving forwards and that means not bringing up the cheating every time an argument arises.

‘That can be tough and so you really need to take a period of time to consider whether you can take them back and genuinely learn to forget the cheating and trust them or if it's more out of desperation not to lose them.

‘The latter means you will likely live the relationship in constant anxiety, which isn't healthy.’

Psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy explained that often women feel, or want to feel, that their man has been manipulated by another other woman.

‘When the man cheats it is interpreted as being inspired, encouraged and manipulated by the other woman.'

He said the wronged partner can see the 'the other woman' as a 'threat to their self-worth, self-esteem and to their personal identity.

‘But they still want to blame them as it becomes part of a coping strategy. They can attribute their pain and low self-esteem to something that is outside of the relationship they're trying to fix.'

Laura Yates said  ending a relationship can sometimes be the only way to recover from a partner's betrayal.

‘The anger and bitterness you experience when you have being wronged by someone you love is natural and feeling that is all part of the healing process.

‘But use that anger to fuel you in a positive way as opposed to dwelling on it and allowing it to completely consume you.

‘You will soon realise that your life is far better without someone who cheats on you and that you are worth more.

‘The anger will start to fade. Be kind and good to yourself and take things slowly. Don't let the cheating experience define you.'
