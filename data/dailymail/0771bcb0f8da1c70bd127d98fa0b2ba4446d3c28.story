As he waited for those behind to 
finish, Rory McIlroy sat in the recorder’s area with his face in his 
hands, shaking his head in disbelief.

Even
 by his own standards for shoving a cold shoulder in the face of the 
conventional, what happened at Wentworth on Sunday was simply stunning.

A
 week that had begun with one jaw-dropping statement concerning his 
split from fiancee Caroline  Wozniacki had ended with another and a 
final-round 66 that earned him the unlikeliest of victories in the 
European Tour’s flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship.

The 25-year-old had started the final round trailing overnight leader Thomas Bjorn by seven shots. Thanks to his own brilliance and the shortcomings of Bjorn, another leading Danish sports figure was left with an aching heart as McIlroy claimed his first ever professional title in Europe and a handsome £640,000 first prize.

McIlroy has been playing well all year and was just waiting for the sort of final round he enjoyed here to finish things off.

Few, however, would have predicted it would come at the end of this of all weeks and on this of all courses, where he has enjoyed so little joy in the past.

Runner’s-up spot went to Irishman Shane 
Lowry, who finished a stroke behind, with Bjorn having to settle for a 
tie for third place with Wentworth specialist Luke Donald.     

Poor
 Bjorn. Five shots is the sort of final-round advantage no class player 
should cough up but how many times have we seen it happen over the 
years? All it takes is one bad hole and here the demons that have 
tormented the doleful Dane throughout his career made a wretched 
reappearance once he made a complete hash of the  par-four sixth.

A 
triple-bogey seven there and the two Irishmen from north and south of 
the border had a veritable sparkle in their eye. Then there was Donald, 
who summoned up commendable resolve to come back from a seven of his own
 at the sixth to make a wonderful fist of winning his third PGA title in
 the space of just four years. He chipped in twice on the back nine but 
ultimately left himself with too much to do.

There’s nothing in golf 
that  compares with watching someone of McIlroy’s ilk when they get the 
scent of victory in their nostrils. At times he can look such an average
 putter but it’s uncanny the way they start dropping when nothing else 
will do.

He chipped in for a birdie at the 10th then holed a good 
six-foot putt for another birdie at the 12th.  Perhaps the biggest one 
of all was the 30-footer that disappeared below ground at the 13th.

Ten
 minutes later, McIlroy was receiving his second helping hand of the day
 after Bjorn’s early collapse when Lowry, who had moved into a 
three-shot lead, hooked his drive at the 13th and ran up a double bogey.

McIlroy was worried his concentration might waver during this event, 
given all that had happened off the course in the build-up. But there 
was no chance of that now as he was fully engaged in pulling off the 
victory. At the 16th he made another good up and down, and then another 
at the 17th for a fourth birdie on the back nine. That one might have 
been the sweetest of all. For the first time in the entire tournament, 
he had hit the front.

Sandy landing: bjorn blew the tournament open when he triple bogeyed the 6th hole

At the par-five 18th, McIlroy hit a wonderful 
drive but pushed his second shot into a greenside bunker. Once more, his
 short game saved him as he splashed out to six feet and holed yet 
another gutsy putt for his sixth birdie of the day to go with an eagle 
at the fourth.

After his opening round on Thursday, McIlroy’s 
expectations were so modest he expressed the hope he would simply be 
around for the weekend. Now here he was, in such a commanding position 
that Lowry could hole a mammoth 50-footer for a birdie on the last but 
still come up a shot shy.

Donald had no option but to go for the 
green at the last since he needed an eagle three to tie, and he was 
unlucky to see his ball splash down in the water hazard about three 
yards short of where he was aiming.

Nightmare hole: Donald also struggled on the 6th landing in the bunker and  taking a drop out of the bushes

Never mind a week is a long time 
in politics. Five days seems to be an eternity in McIlroy’s world. Was 
this the same man who sat in the interview room on Wednesday looking so 
devastated it appeared it might be towards the end of summer before he 
would be back to his best? As it turned out, it took until the end of 
the week.

This win is his first of the year and comes just three 
weeks before the US Open over a Pinehurst course where the long  drivers
 and the demon  short-game merchants will have an enormous advantage.

In
 other words, exactly the qualities that got the job done for McIlroy 
last week — that, and a new-found resolution when things are not going 
so well that he showed on Friday, and the requisite touch of luck.

At
 the par-five fourth, his eagle putt hovered on the edge of the hole for
 a few seconds before it eventually dropped. In the end, that proved the
 difference.What a finish to the 60th edition of the PGA 
Championship, then. A little sprinkling of McIlroy stardust and suddenly
 a previously flat golfing season has positively ignited.
