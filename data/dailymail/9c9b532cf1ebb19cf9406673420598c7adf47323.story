A groom posing for pictures after tying the knot made a dash from the wedding line up - and chased down a suspected Peeping Tom.

Mark Hobbs and his new wife Amanda were with friends and family outside a registry office in Bristol when he spotted a mystery man stooping in the crowd.

The 44-year-old assumed he had stolen a camera from one of the distracted guests' bags and shouted a warning.

Mr Hobbs and his two best men gave chase and rugby tackled the man, who had allegedly been taking pictures up the skirts of some of the guests.

They held him for around ten minutes until police arrived.

Officers discovered the man had not actually stolen a camera - and after checking pictures taken on it - arrested him on suspicion of voyeurism. 

Mr Hobbs, a window maker,  said: 'I wasn't expecting to chase someone down the street while wearing my best suit but it certainly proved a talking point.'

Barmaid Amanda, 42, and Mark, both divorcees, met in a pub in Fishponds, Bristol, three-and-a-half-years-ago.

Love blossomed and Mark surprised barmaid Amanda by proposing at his brother's wedding. They got married at Bristol Registry office on Saturday July 26.

Describing the drama, Amanda, of Mangotsfield, South Gloucestershire, said: 'I was a bit surprised when I turned around and half the wedding party had disappeared, but everyone always says that we're quite a chaotic couple.

'Guests were telling us "This sort of thing would only ever happen at your wedding!".

'This was just one of those things - we took it in our stride.'

Police confirmed that officers were called at around 4pm on July 26.

A spokesman said: 'The suspect had been pursued by a group of people who detained him.

'He had a camera and a phone in his possession which were seized.

'The 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism and has been released on police bail.'
