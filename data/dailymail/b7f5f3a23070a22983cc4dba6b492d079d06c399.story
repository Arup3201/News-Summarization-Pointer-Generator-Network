A retired teacher died in a ‘one-in-a-million’ accident after he was trampled by an elephant while pursuing his love of photography on holiday in India, an inquest heard today.

Colin Manvell, 67, of Havant, Hampshire, was travelling on the latest of several trips to visit local friends in the Tamil Nadu area of southern India to go on safari with the aim of seeing a tiger.

It was believed Mr Manvell was alone when he was trampled by the elephant at the Masinagudi National Park, said David Horsley, coroner for Portsmouth and South East Hampshire.

He said that he had received very little information from the Indian authorities about the incident and the only report sent to him had been photocopied badly and was incomplete.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Horsley said: ‘We do not know any more than an elephant must have come out of the undergrowth making trumpeting sounds and he was in its way. I have no more information than that.’

He added: ‘He has been out on holiday photographing wildlife, in not necessarily a remote area because there was a hospital, but he has been out in an area where there are wild animals and unfortunately he has been in the way of a stampeding elephant.

‘It is the first time I have encountered anything like this as a coroner, he was clearly out in India doing what he loved. It was maybe the way he would have wanted to go.’

His nephew, Roger Manvell, said that his uncle died on September 19 last year ‘doing something that he loved’. He added that the family did not have any more information about how his uncle died.

Holiday: Mr Manvell was a retired geography teacher and he also worked at a tennis and squash club

The 48-year-old tennis coach from Hill Head, Hampshire, said that his uncle had been a frequent visitor to India and would stay with local friends he had made there.

Mr Manvell said: ‘He had always travelled a lot ever since I can remember. I think he had been there a week or so before he had died.

‘On the last number of occasions he had been (in India), he always goes out with some friends on what we would call a safari.

‘He’s very keen on his photography, particularly birds, flowers, he was always on the pretence of looking for a tiger, always intent on tracking or seeing a tiger in the wild but every time he came back he was a bit closer to seeing one but he never got to see a tiger.

‘He was very happy taking photographs of everything. He was not a thrill-seeker or anything, just enjoyed seeing the culture out there and spending time with friends he met there.’

Speaking of the incident, he added: ‘I would assume that he was taking some photos of some wild birds by a water hole, it sounds like he was on his own because if there had been someone else there this might not have happened.’

Mr Manvell said that his uncle appeared to have good eyesight and hearing, contradicting reports following his death that he had difficulty with his hearing.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Manvell and his sister Karen Clark, 46, said that his death had been a ‘one-in-a-million’ accident.

Mr Manvell said: ‘We have known our uncle Colin all our lives and we have always known him as a traveller who gave his time generously to his school and tennis clubs and all his other friends and family.

‘When I heard last September it was a 
big shock to us and the family. He was always a very keen traveller and 
died doing something he loved and we still have his photographs from his
 travels which we will hold very dear to us.

'It was quite unbelievable when it happened at the time, it’s a one-in-a-million'

Roger Manvell, nephew

‘It was quite unbelievable when it happened at the time, it’s a one-in-a-million.’

He said that the lack of information 
from India was understandable and added: ‘The Foreign Office were very 
good at the time, they helped us out with the repatriation.

‘The details they got were sketchy, unless we actually speak to his friends out in India face-to-face, it’s very difficult.’

Trampled to death: Mr Manvell appeared to have good eyesight and hearing, his nephew told the inquest

Mr Manvell was a retired geography teacher at Warblington School in Havant, and he also worked at the Avenue Tennis and Squash Club in the town.

'He was clearly out in India doing what he loved. It was maybe the way he would have wanted to go'

David Horsley, coroner

Mr Manvell joined Warblington School in 1988 and retired 10 years later.

Headteacher Julia Vincent said: ‘Mr Manvell retired from head of geography at Warblington School a number of years ago.

‘Although I did not know him personally, he was well-known to the school community and has kindly donated a trophy for academic achievement in geography.

‘We were saddened to hear of this tragic accident and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family at this sad time.’

Location: He was visiting friends in the Tamil Nadu area of India and went to the Masinagudi National Park
