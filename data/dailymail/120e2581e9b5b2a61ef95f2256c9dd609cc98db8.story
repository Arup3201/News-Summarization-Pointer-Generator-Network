Every bride dreams of being swept off her feet on her wedding day, but one Californian newlywed took the phrase too literally after being sent flying off the back of a horse.

Lauren Mahaffey had spent hours having her makeup, hair, and nails perfected before going for a dream photoshoot on Myrtle Beach, southern California, in the weeks before her ceremony.

Just as the shoot was due to end, a passing rider offered to lend Mrs Mahaffey her horse to take a picture on top of, and she happily accepted and went to jump into the saddle.

But just as she settled on top of the animal it bolted, running across the beach and sending her crashing headfirst into the sand.

Bride-to-be Lauren Mahaffey was posing for a pre-wedding photoshoot on a Californian beach when a passerby offered to lend their horse for a picture. However, as Mrs Mahaffey climbed on to the animal it bolted

Eventually Mrs Mahaffey was left face-down in the sand after being thrown off the horse, but despite being bruised went on to pose for more pictures for another half an hour

Groom Joshua Mahaffey was unaware of the accident until his wedding day a few weeks later when he was shown the video, alongside 200 guests, who were left in fits of laughter

Photographer Jarrett Hucks warned against posing with the animal, saying it would be unpredictable, and was soon proved right. He said he was worried for Mrs Mahaffey's safety after the accident, but when he rushed over he found her laughing

The footage was caught on camera by wedding photographer Jarrett Hucks who rushed to bride's aid - only to find her in fits of laughter.

Meanwhile the horse continued to buck and nearly knocked over its handler before the owner finally stepped in to bring the situation under control.

Groom Joshua Mahaffey knew nothing of the accident until a few weeks later at the wedding when his blushing bride revealed all.

Jarrett said: 'My client decided that since you only live once, she wanted to take a photo on top of a horse. I'm not much of a fan of large animals myself because of the unpredictability of them, but I agreed to take the photo if she wanted.

Dumped: Mrs Mahaffey lays face-down in the sand on Myrtle Beach, California, with a shoe sitting to one side, after being thrown from a horse while posing for pre-wedding pictures

Shaken: Wedding photographer Mr Hucks said he worried that Mrs Mahaffey was seriously injured after the accident last month, but when he ran over was relived to find her laughing

Despite taking a tumble into the sand Mrs Mahaffey was left with only a few minor bruises, and was even able to finish the shoot

'Everyone thought it was very funny as soon as we knew she was OK. It was the subject of many laughs on the wedding day.

'I think it scared her as it was happening but when we got to her she was already laughing. She was such a good sport that she posed for another half an hour even though she was a bit bruised.

'The groom was shown the video on the wedding day and I watched the expression on his face. He was pretty shocked but he knew that she was ok and he did see the funny side. 

'The video was shown at the evening party to around 200 people, and others have since watched it on the internet.'

The wedding photographer who captured the unforgettable moment was Jarrett Hucks.

Bad idea: Mrs Mahaffey is pictured hitching up her dress before attempting to climb on to the horse which suddenly made a run for it

Moments from disaster: All still appears calm as Mrs Mahaffey takes the saddle on top of the unruly animal, but moments later it bolted

 Terror: Mrs Mahaffey appears to be laughing, or screaming, or a mixture of both as she disappears off camera on top of the horse

There she goes: Mrs Mahaffey holds on in vain as the frightened horse disappears off camera before dumping her on to the beach

Jarrett, who has been a professional wedding photographer for three years, added: 'The horse owner didn't stick around for very long after the bride fell off. I've had a couple of funny things happen on shoots before but none who has had their life in danger.

'This was a really easy-going wedding day. It went really smooth and the weather was great.'

The happy couple have now put the horsing around behind them and are enjoying a honeymoon in Hawaii. 

How it should have looked: Mrs Mahaffey did eventually get a picture with the horse, though decided not to ride it this time around

Stunning: Despite the accident Mrs Mahaffey carried on with the shoot, including this shot, which she showed to her husband on their big day - along with the video of the horse
