If you thought your grandmother's collection of empty jam jars and half-eaten crisp packets made her England's champion hoarder, think again.

John Collingwood has lived in the house he was born in for almost 80 years - and has barely parted with a single of his mother’s kitchen appliances.

Even the 1960s fridge is still keeping food cool for the 79-year-old in his house in West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire.

Old timer: John Collingwood has barely changed a thing in his family home since his parents' deaths 50 years ago

The former textile worker was born at his beloved
 house in 1934 and has lived there 
ever since in a time warp of treasured family belongings

Mr Collingwood's parents bought the house in
 1925 and he has barely changed a thing 
since they died 50 years ago.

Mr Collingwood said: 'If my parents walked into 
my kitchen today they would say that nothing has changed, it’s still 
exactly the same as when they lived here in the 60s.

Keeping time: From the clock to the antique hoover, Mr Collingwood keeps his parents' house exactly as it was

'I still have my mother’s cooker, which is about 65 years old, I remember amazing meals coming out of it when I was younger.

'The fridge from 1965 is still going, I like that my house is getting old with me.

'I don’t want to change anything, I want to keep everything exactly as it is and how my parents and brother left it.

'The bathroom hasn’t changed at all, my toilet and bathtub are older than me.'

Mr Collingwood, who worked in a factory for more than 40 years, scoffs at the idea 
of updating his house with what most would see as necessary modern conveniences.

Family values: Antique experts have offered Mr Collingwood large sums of money for some of the items in his house, but he refuses to part with them

Spring clean? Mr Collingwood assumes that the bathroom and toilet in his house are far older than his 79 years - and sees no need to replace them

He said: 'I don’t have any electricals - I just don’t need them. I think it’s funny how people are always buying new things.

'I have a wind-up gramophone and a radio from 1950 in my brother’s room.

'I do have central heating now but I’m not very happy about it.'

The pensioner admitted that he has had central heating installed - 'but I'm not very happy about it', he added.

Mr Collingwood said he had been offered money for some of the items in his house,
 but he would not part with any of them.

Still running: Mr Collingwood still uses his mother's 1960s fridge - along with the user manual

He said: 'An antiques expert came to the
 house and said my furniture was really valuable and encouraged me to 
sell it.

'I couldn’t sell them, because if I sold my drawers or my wardrobe, where would I put the stuff I keep in them?

'They belong in this house storing my family’s belongings.'

Mr Collingwood even has an air-raid shelter in the back garden where he and his family
 hid during the bombings of the Second World War.

His mother turned it into a laundry room 
when the war was over, and he still uses it to this day.

Brave boys: Mr Collingwood's brother served in the forces, but Mr Collingwood could not for medical reasons

Mr Collingwood added: 'I never served in the forces because I couldn’t pass the 
medical, my brother went away for three years but I’ve always lived here
 in this house.'

Over the years Mr Collingwood has seen his neighbours grow up around him - and some have moved on - but he would never leave the street he loves.

He said: 'When my parents bought the house it was the only one on the road, lots of people have come and gone since then.

'There are people on the street who are older than me but no one has lived here as long as I have.

'I would never move somewhere else, it has never even occurred to me, I will be here for the rest of my life.'

They'd have been proud: Mr Collingwood wants to keep the house his parents kept so carefully
