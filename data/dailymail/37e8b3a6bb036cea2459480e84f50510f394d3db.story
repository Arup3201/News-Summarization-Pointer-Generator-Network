David Gregory has signed up to appear on Yahoo! next month, it was announced Tuesday, just over two months after he was unloaded from NBC's much more high-profile Meet the Press amid historically dismal ratings.

Gregory, 44, will join his fellow major network cast-off and former NBC co-worker Katie Couric for a midterm election night coverage show for the internet company.

While Gregory has not joined Yahoo in any larger capacity, his appearance could mark a return to TV of sorts after spending the months since his NBC ouster doing paid speaking gigs.

Back in the game? David Gregory will appear on a streaming Yahoo midterm elections special with Katie Couric on November 4--just over two months since his sudden departure from NBC

Surprise! Couric, who is also a major network cast-off, originally described her special guests on the Yahoo News Midterm Election Mixer as 'surprise' but her former NBC co-worker Gregory's name has since been revealed

The so-called 'Yahoo News Midterm Election Mixer' will kick off November 4 at 5pm and features other guests including 'Grover Norquist, Politico’s Mike Allen, CPAC’s Neera Tanden, strategist Jamal Simmons, David Swerdlick from The Root,' according to the website.

Gregory left NBC in August after 20 years at the network and the move stunned many, if not for its ceremoniousness, then for Gregory's reported severance pay.

According to The New York Post, Gregory walked away from his moderator job with $4 million and the promise he'd never bad mouth the network.

His boss at the time said his ouster simply came down to ratings.

'The time had come for this to happen,' NBC News president Deborah Turness, told the New York Times. '[the] numbers just didn’t move.'

'Looking forward to it!': The old co-workers tweeted at each other in anticipation of the November 4 event

He'll join on election night a fellow television journalist who's also accustomed to less-than-savory departures from banner-name outlets.

Katie Couric, who's hosted shows on all big three networks with varying degrees of success over the years, tweeted at Gregory on Tuesday to welcome him to her group of special guests and to remind viewers to 'Save the date.'

Gregory tweeted back: 'Looking forward to it!'

However, Gregory has said nothing else about his appearance on the show--and thus whether or not he's also looking forward to the job leading to something more.
