Britain’s major stores are offering a ‘half-price high street’ in a desperate bid to shift a mountain of summer stock.

The recent cold weather means retailers have been forced to offer big savings on everything from summer dresses and bikinis to barbecues and patio furniture.

Debenhams, House of Fraser and Laura Ashley have launched half-price sales, and John Lewis has been dragged into the fray because it must match many of the reductions under its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ price promise.

Its sales were down by 5.2 per cent last week on the year before, when takings were boosted by products linked to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The price cuts are so deep that the average cost of all products other than food is down compared with a year ago – the first time this has happened in three years.

Clothes and shoes are down by 5.7 per cent, and electrical goods by 5.2 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium. DIY and garden products, seen as non-essentials, are also showing big falls.

On Monday a BRC study is expected to confirm shoppers have deserted many town centres as a result of the cost of living squeeze and a switch to online shopping.

Retailers are having to sacrifice profit margins as a result of the ‘desperation sales’.

Shares
in the Home Retail Group, which owns Argos and Homebase, fell sharply 
earlier this week after it revealed it has had to make big cuts.

At Argos margins were down by 0.75 of a point and at Homebase by 2 per cent, as the disappointing start to summer hit seasonal sales of outdoor toys, barbecues, garden furniture and lawn mowers.

Desperation sales: One-off sale events and online discounts offer some of the best deals

Argos is promoting ‘The Big Sale’, which includes reductions of up to 60 per cent on garden patio furniture. John Lewis will launch its clearance sales online on Wednesday and in stores on Thursday.

Marks & Spencer has held one-off bargain events, such as 20 per cent off all menswear this week. 

Gap was promoting a 15 per cent off one-day sale on its website yesterday, while electrical retailer Currys is offering up to 40 per cent off large kitchen appliances and up to £300 off large flatscreen TVs. 

The sales are designed to tempt customers suffering the longest squeeze on incomes ever recorded, with price rises having outpaced increases in pay for four years.

The failure of major chains like Comet, Game, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports reflect the difficulties faced by retailers.

At the same time, value chains such as Primark and Aldi are thriving.

Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King suggested one way to help stores fight off the threat from cheaper internet rivals, who do not have to pay business rates, is to introduce a new web sales tax.

The money might be redistributed to cut rates or the cost of parking. ‘The burden of taxation falls very heavily on bricks and mortar retailers. I think we need to rebalance the tax burden,’ he said.
