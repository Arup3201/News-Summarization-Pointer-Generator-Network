A police officer shot a woman in the leg early Friday at a Hollywood parking structure after she fought with another woman and pointed a gun at the officer, authorities said.

Diamond Vargas, 47, was charged with suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon against a police officer, Los Angeles police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said.

She was in stable condition at a hospital.

The incident occurred just before 1.30am at the Hollywood & Highland Center, which hosts the Academy Awards in its Dolby Theatre.

A security officer reported the fight to authorities.

'One woman was armed with a bat at that time; then that woman armed herself with a firearm; then an officer-involved shooting occurred,' Smith said.

Vargas was allegedly smashing a scooter with the baseball bat when authorities approached, KTLA reports.

Gun: When Vargas saw officers approaching, she allegedly pulled out a gun and pointed it at them

'She then sees the officers, at which point she goes to her pocket, pulls out a handgun,' Dennis Kato, LAPD commander told KTLA. 

'She pointed it at the security guard … then she points it at the officers and an officer-involved shooting occurred.'

The woman pointed the gun at the officer before he fired at her, Smith said.

Smith said he doesn't know what the relationship was between the two women or what they were fighting about. It is unclear whether the other woman will face charges as well, KTLA reports. 

The incident remained under investigation.

It could not be immediately determined if Vargas has a lawyer. She is being held on $100,000 bail.

Hospital: Vargas was taken to a hospital where she was listed in stable condition
