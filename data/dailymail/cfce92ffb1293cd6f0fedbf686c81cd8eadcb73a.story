Ex-Fulham boss Felix Magath has ripped into his former players claiming they were relegated from the Premier League because of a lack of order, discipline and fitness.

The German was sacked by the Cottagers in September after leading his side to just one point from their first seven Championship fixtures.

But Magath, who believes England's national side must start modelling themselves on World Cup winners Germany, says that Fulham's failure was down to the players and not his style of management.

Magath's honours as a manager: Bundesliga title (2005, 2006, 2009), German Cup (2005, 2006), Intertoto Cup (2002)

Fulham honours: First Division (2001), Seond Division (1932, 1949, 1999), FA Cup runners-up (1975), Europa League runners-up (2010), Intertoto Cup (2002)

Speaking to The Sun On Sunday, Magath said: 'If you want to be successful, you need order, discipline and fitness. These are the three key components I demand from my players, who are earning seven-figure salaries.'

The 61-year-old also claims that his squad lacked the necessary spirit to survive in the top-flight, even citing a former Prime Minister as the last Englishman to exhibit the quality he looks for.

'And you need English spirit,' Magath added. 'The last person to show this properly from England was Winston Churchill. But I didn't see much close to that during my time at Fulham.'

The former Bayern Munich boss, who has managed Wolfsburg and Schalke among other German clubs, was also left unimpressed by Fulham's lack of silverware.

The west London side are yet to win a major trophy during their 135-year history, something two-time Bundesliga winner Magath regards as a major downfall.

He said: 'They can't keep living off the fact that in their entire history they have reached a Europa League final in 2010 and FA Cup final in 1975.

'If that was all I had on my CV, I'd consider myself a failure.'
