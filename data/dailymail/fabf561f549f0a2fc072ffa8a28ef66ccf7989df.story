A jet liner bound for Seattle was forced to make an emergency landing after the captain lost consciousness - forcing his co-pilot to guide it to safety.

The Alaska Airlines pilot blacked out 'somewhere over Oregon' and had to be treated by a doctor on board the flight, which was carrying 121 people.

The incident, yesterday, is the second time this year that an Alaska Airlines pilot has lost consciousness in the cockpit of one of the firm's aircraft.

Emergency: The co-pilot of an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Seattle was forced to make an emergency landing after the captain lost consciousness

Safe: The plane landed safely in Portland Oregon, where the pilot was taken to hospital by ambulance

On January 22, the co-pilot on an Alaska 
Airlines flight from Seattle to Las Vegas fainted for a short period and required medical attention.

The plane, which was carrying 146 passengers, landed safely at Las Vegas. The two incidents are not thought to be related, ABC News reports.

A spokesman for the Alaska Airlines said that in yesterday's incident, the co-pilot declared an emergency in order to get 
priority care for the captain after he passed out.

The pilot, who regained consciousness, was tended to by a doctor on board before being taken to hospital once the plane had touched down at Portland International Airport.

Transfer: Passengers on board the flight were reportedly transferred to other planes in order to complete their journey

Schedule: The flight had been due to land in Seattle at 9.30pm before being diverted to Portland (above)

He has not been named but is reported to have worked for the airline for nearly 30 years. The co-pilot who landed the plane is understood to have worked for the airline for 11 years.

The Boeing 737-700 aircraft was 
carrying 116 passengers and five crew when it left Los Angeles at about 
6:30 pm headed northwards for Seattle where it was due to land at 9.30pm.

It eventually landed in Portland two and a half hours 
later following the captain's black out.

A number of passengers were swapped 
onto other flights to Seattle, while the rest took a flight scheduled to
land in the city at 1:15 am on Friday, according to NBC News.

All of the airline's pilots are trained to fly single-handedly, ABC reports.
