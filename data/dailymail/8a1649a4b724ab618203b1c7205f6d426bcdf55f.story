At first glance, this copper rockfish may not seem out of the ordinary.

But the ageing fish does look a little different, after undergoing eye surgery to remove cataracts.

Vets in Vancouver carried out the first-of-its-kind surgery at an aquarium to stop the fish being attacked by others.

Medical eye opener: An ageing copper rockfish has been fitted with a fake eye (pictured) by vets in Vancouver, who carried out the first-of-its-kind surgery to take place at the aquarium to stop the fish being attacked by others

The copper rockfish lives in the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre’s Strait of Georgia exhibit.

Like other animals, rockfishes often encounter some health issues as they age, and this particular fish was found to have developed cataracts in its left eye, according to the aquarium’s head veterinarian, Dr Martin Haulena.

The fish's damaged eye was replaced with a taxidermy eye for cosmetic reasons, as well as in a bid to keep it alive in an environment where competition is fierce.

This is because, without an eye, other fish in the tank would have acted aggressively towards, or 'bullied' the partially blind fish, assuming it to be sick and weak.

Copper rockfish are relatively common from the Gulf of Alaska to the Pacific side of the Baja California peninsula.

They swim in both deep and shallow waters, from 33 to 160 ft (10 to 183 metres).

The fish come in many colours from reddish dark brown with pale copper blotches along the sides, to a light pink/brown with yellow and white mottling.

Males are known to mature between three and seven years, while females mature between four and eight years.

They give birth to live young after a gestation period of 10 months.

The oldest copper rockfish is known to have reached 55 years old, with many living into their 40s.

They typically reach a maximum length of 23 inches (58cm) and weigh up to 6lbs (2.7kg).

While the cosmetic surgery may keep the creature alive for further years, it is now partially sighted and at a disadvantage to its completely healthy peers. 

Dr Haulena, and Seattle Aquarium’s head vet, Dr Lesanna Lahner, fitted the new eye to the bone above the fish’s eye socket by sewing it on with nylon sutures, and attaching it with titanium clips.

The copper rock fish was anaesthetised for the procedure.

Another rockfish - a yellowtail - underwent the same procedure and will soon return to the exhibit.

Dr Haulena said in a blog post: ‘Some people don’t realise how much effort we give fish.’ 

It is perhaps unlikely that the fish would have survived in the wild without medical attention.

Losing an eye can make fish appear weak, causing other fish to attack it
