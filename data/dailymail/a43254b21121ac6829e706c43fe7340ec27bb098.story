Voters want Britain to be run by a Tin Man politician who is ‘all brains and no heart’, according to new polling based on the Wizard of Oz which will be seen as a boost for David Cameron.

In a blow for Ed Miliband’s emotional pitch to the electorate, fewer people would vote for a Scarecrow, who is ‘all heart and no brains’.

The survey of voters in the UK is based on polling which has successfully predicted the outcome of US Presidential elections.

Tin Man: Voters who prefer a leader who is 'all brains, no heart' are more likely to back David Cameron's Tories

Scarecrow: Ed Miliband's emotional pitch to voters is more likely to be viewed as 'all heart, no brains'

Experts say voters will base their decision on who to back at the 2015 on whether they prefer someone smart enough to run the country or if their heart is in the right place.

In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy is joined on her journey to the Emerald City by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion.

Leading American pollster John Zogby has been posing the Wizard of Oz question since 2000. 

He asks: ‘Imagine you live in the land of Oz, and the candidates are the Tin Man, who's all brains and no heart, and the Scarecrow, who's all heart and no brains. Who would you vote for?'

Amongst all voters, a majority prefer the Tin Man over the Scarecrow

It is designed to unpick voters’ reactions to differing leadership styles. In the 2000 race for the White House, Al Gore was well ahead of George W Bush in traditional polling, but the Tin Man was neck and neck with the Scarecrow. The result of the election was similarly close.

Now YouGov has put the question to voters in the UK. Of all those surveyed, 41 per cent say they would prefer to be led by the Tin Man, compared to just 32 per cent who chose the Scarecrow.

This suggests voters want someone to take hard-headed decisions, rather than someone whose heart is in the right place.

The Tories will seize on the results as proof their commitment to economic competence is valued by voters more than the warm-hearted concerns about the cost of living expressed by Labour’s Ed Miliband.

People who said they would back the Conservatives at the next election favour the Tin Man by 60 per cent to 21 per cent, but among Labour supports 41 per cent prefer the Scarecrow over 32 per cent who said Tin Man.

There are also big differences in gender and region.

Amongst men, 46 per cent back the Tin Man, well ahead of the 27 per cent who chose the Scercrow.

But for women, 37 per cent said Scaregrow, one point ahead of Tin Man.

Younger voters also support the Tin Man, with only the over-60s putting the Scarecrow ahead.

Tories prefer Tin Men but Labour supporters prefer Scarecrows, the YouGov polling revelaed

Men prefer the Tin Man while women prefer the Scarecrow, while only the over-60s prefer the idea of being run by someone who is 'all heart and no brains'

The Tin Man also has large majorities of around 17 points in London and the South, but in the North of England only one point separates the two choices.

Separate polling by YouGov shows that just 23 per cent of voters think the Tories' ‘heart is in the right place’ and 86 per cent say the party is ‘very close’ or ‘fairly close’ to the rich.

The difference in approach by the two political leaders was laid bare today.

In a worrying sign for the Tories, the Tin Man is favoured in London and the South, but the gap is much narrower in the North where there are few Conservative-held seats

Mr Cameron is in China this week leading a trade delegation which has focussed on securing billsions of pounds of investment in the UK.

But Mr Miliband was on the Daybreak sofa highlighting how women have been hit hard by the consequences of the financial crash which occurred under Labour.

He claims those working full-time on average £2,500 out of pocket over the last three years.

Mr Miliband said: ‘This cost-of-living crisis is hitting women particularly hard. Women have seen their wages on average, if you are working full-time, go down by £2,500 in just three years because prices have been rising faster than wages.’
