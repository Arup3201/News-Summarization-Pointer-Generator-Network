Cronulla Sharks captain Paul Gallen has blamed a few too many drinks and abusive NRL fans for the tweet he sent out last month lashing out the the NRL management team.

In the post on his Twitter account a few weeks ago, Gallen, who was holidaying in Hawaii wrote: 'Steve Noice (sic) actually cared about players from Cronulla's feelings. Couldn't say that about any other c*** from Nrl'.

Now the skipper has spoken out about the sacking of Cronulla chief executive Steve Noyce, saying alcohol and a few particularly nasty fans were to blame for the offensive outburst which saw him fined $50,000.

Paul Gallen has blamed alcohol and abusive fans for his outburst on Twitter last month which saw him cop a $50,000 fine

'I was out at a restaurant, going through my Instagram feed and I had a photo with an Australian. Turns out he was from Queensland and he had a crack at me on the actual photo and that’s what annoyed me,' Gallen told radio station TripleM, according to Fox Sports.

He said after that he went out and met Roosters half back Mitchell Pearce for some drinks, but got hassled on his way home by a bunch of Australians which also riled him up.

'I got back in the hotel, the WI-FI came on the phone and Noycey (Cronulla CEO Steve Noyce) had been sacked. It upset me. I wrote the tweet in the foyer of my hotel, I got up to my room and deleted it but it had already got out there,' Gallen revealed.

After removing the controversial post, Gallen posted the above image on Instagram with the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'.

The Sharks captain also said he was appealing the severity of the fine, and revealed there was no bad blood between him and his club over the drama.

When Noyce was fired last month, it left the the 2014 wooden spooners without a CEO or coach. The team is also also under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. 

Gallen removed the original post after several users advised him to take it down, but it was not soon enough to avoid any controversy.

He later posted an image on Instagram with Sydney Roosters halfback Mitchell Pearce, and the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'.

Users took to social media to address the controversial tweet.

Crowdiegal said: ‏'I'm sorry but if I said what Paul Gallen said about my bosses ... I'd be sacked. He is very lucky to still have a job right now imo'.

Others have shown their support for Gallen, with Samuel Abbs writing: 'Good on Paul Gallen, someone should of (sic) said that months ago, truth hurts.'

Gallen is no stranger to dramas on social media.

Last year he had a spat with veteran NRL coach Brian Smith in an acrimonious exchange on Twitter, after the former Sydney Roosters mentor accused him of running away from Dylan Napa after a brutal hit from the Tricolours prop.

A number of the messages that appeared on Gallen's account during the exchange were later credited to his father Garry. 

The Sharks finished bottom of the ladder for the past two seasons, and are still under investigation from ASADA

Noyce joined the Sharks as football manager in April last year, before taking over the chief executive's role soon after. 

The sharks are currently under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority for their 2011 season supplement program.

Gallen suffered a backdated ban that is due to expire on November 23, meaning he will miss the upcoming international Four Nations tournament.

The Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Noyce was known to have been very supportive to players, in particular Gallen, during the controversial investigations.
