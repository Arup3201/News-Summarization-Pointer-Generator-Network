The ‘rantings’ of celebrities like Russel Brand are encouraging young people to give up on politics, David Blunkett will claim today.

The former Labour Home Secretary will take aim at the comedian for undermining democracy by telling people not to bother voting.

And he will accuse politicians of wooing older people who are more likely to vote, while imposing deeper cuts on the young who have all but given up on the ballot box.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warns 'ranting' by comedian Russell Brand is putting young people off politics

Brand sparked controversy last year when he said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant.

He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it’s real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution.

'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' 

In a speech today Mr Blunkett will accuse Brand of telling the disengaged to abandoned politics, leaving the main parties to focus on those who already have a voice.

He will also criticise writer Will Self for claiming anyone who joins a political party is a ‘donkey’.

Mr Blunket will say: ‘[Self] and those like him - forget even the rantings of Russell Brand, I’m talking about something far more serious and insidious - are encouraging others to give up whatever small influence they might have in favour of those who already have a voice, influence and, therefore, a say.

‘In the end, the two groups of people in positions of leadership have to be prepared to come together not in some sort of cosy cabal but in an endeavour to raise understanding, to provide information and encouragement to participation.

‘Those two groups are politicians, and in their various guises, those working through old and new media.’

will argue that disengagement from politics has major consequences for public policy. Giving the Centre For Social Justice’s ‘Good Society’ Lecture on the theme of Reconnecting the British People with the Political Process

Mr Blunkett is delivering a lecture on Reconnecting the British People with the Political Process to the Centre For Social Justice.

He will point to figures showing that ‘older people, wealthier people, better educated people, engaged people’ are most likely to vote, which ‘young people, poor people, badly educated people’ are the least.

As a result politicians of all parties ‘fear alienating’ the more engaged, while choosing to ‘ignore’ those who do not bother voting, placing them instead in the ‘firing line’ for spending cuts.

‘Paradoxically the more those who are not engaged are ignored, targeted under the austerity programme and dismissed, the more alienated and disillusioned they become. Politicians they say “don’t give a damn about us”.’

Last year a survey found 4 in 10 people are so disconnected from politics they might not vote.

The alienated voters do not trust people in public life and are left unimpressed by all political parties.

The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog warned that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future.

Voters are also now more likely to say MPs will take bribes, lie and are out of touch.

Brand has appeared on several TV shows attacking politicians and arguing that people should rise up against the main parties.

Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman took him to task in a high profile interview last year, but later admitted he finds the current parties so uninspiring he also has not bothered to vote.

Paxman revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates.

Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.

‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’

But Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example.

Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’
