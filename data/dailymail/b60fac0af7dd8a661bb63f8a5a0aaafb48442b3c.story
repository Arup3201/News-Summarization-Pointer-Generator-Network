The new and unreleased Charlie Hebdo magazine - featuring the Prophet Muhammad on its front cover - is already fetching huge sums of money on eBay.

With 15 hours remaining until the item expires, bidding for one copy has already surpassed £500. It soared from its original price of 99p to the £511 it currently stands at, in just over six hours. 

The seller from Gloucester says in the item's description: 'I have a small supply of the Charlie Hebdo magazines available that I can post out friday 16th January from the UK.

'These are the special edition with Mohammad depicted, that has been released due to the recent tragic events.'

Expensive: Bidding for one copy has already surpassed £500 with more than 15 hours until the item expires

Demand: Another copy of the new edition, featuring the Prophet Muhammad on the front cover, reached £409

Response: Three million copies of the first Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured) since the gruesome attack on their office will be printed 

The price of another copy has reached £409 after 24 bids, as online shoppers scramble to reserve one of the 2,000 copies being shipped to the UK - even though they will not reach British shops until Friday.

That item's seller, located in Spilsby, confirms to his bidders that copies will arrive in the UK on January 16.

Magazine wholesalers, Smith News and Menzies Distribution, confirmed they will be supplying the new edition to British readers.

A spokesman at Menzies Distribution Ltd said: 'We don't expect to face particular security issues, but we will take whatever precautions our security team believe are sensible to ensure the safety of our employees.' 

The French Bookshop in South Kensington, West London, has warned customers that it will not receive copies until Friday morning.

The edition is being printed in French, Italian and Turkish - and digital versions will also be available in English, Spanish and Arabic.

Surviving members of the magazine will print three million copies of its first edition  since the gruesome attacks on its offices last week.

Six of the publication's journalists, including its editor Stephane Charbonnier, were gunned down by Islamist gunmen, Said and Cherif Kouachi.

The new front cover features the headline 'all is forgiven' over a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad - weeping as he holds a placard reading 'Je Suis Charlie'.

It was drawn by Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who survived the killings because he was late for work that day.

A village shopkeeper in the UK says she will stock more than 100 copies of the new issue  to show her support for free speech.

Ila Aghera said she was 'nervous' about selling the French satirical magazine in the wake of last week's terrorist atrocity in Paris.

But the 54-year-old, whose shop is in an upmarket village, has already received 80 orders for the magazine from across the UK, for the cover price is £3.50.

She said: 'It is important for future generations for them to see this, to know what happened.

'I am nervous. I'm shaking now, I'm only a little village shop but I don't care because what I am doing is right. We will be selling it from Friday. I think I'm the first one to do it. I might be old-fashioned but I'm not going to be scared. I'm selling it as a one-off.'

The mother-of-two added: 'All age groups should know what happened. What happened in France is very upsetting, it was very wrong – for a silly cartoon that was a joke to make people laugh. I've ordered over 100 copies. I'm just doing my job and providing a service. If people want to read it they should be able to.'
