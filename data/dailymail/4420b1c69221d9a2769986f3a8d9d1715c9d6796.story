A teenage waitress was handed a role in the new Richard Curtis film About Time - after serving the British director a slice of pizza.

Set for stardom: Waitress-turned-actress Rachel Chew appears in the new Richard Curtis film

Rebecca Chew, 18, was working at a seaside cafe when Curtis, who is famous for romantic comedies Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, came in for dinner with his family.

Rebecca failed to recognise the famous diner, who was in Polkerris in Cornwall to film scenes for About Time, which stars Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams.

After serving pizza to Curtis and his family, the teenager thought nothing more of last summer’s encounter until a month later, when she received a call from an assistant director.

He explained that Curtis was on the hunt for someone to play a waitress in the time-travelling comedy and had been so impressed with Rebecca's service skills, he wanted her for the part.

Rebecca was on holiday in Mallorca when she took the call, after completing a diploma in singing while working at Sam’s On The Beach restaurant.

The teen, who accepted the role immediately, then joined Hollywood stars including Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams on set.

She said: 'I was on holiday so it was all very surreal. The assistant director called me up and said Richard Curtis would like me to play a small part in the film.

'I was in shock. I think he must just have seen me at Sam’s on the Beach and thought I might fit the role.

'It was a massive surprise. It’s quite an honour really and I love his films, like Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral.

'I’d heard rumours about him filming in Cornwall but when he came in with his family I didn’t recognise him at first. I’m just a Cornish girl - this isn’t something you expect to happen.

'Rachel McAdams came in later in the evening so the pizza must have gone down well.'

Rebecca described filming her scene, in which she serves a sandwich to Irish Harry Potter actor, Gleeson, in a cafe as 'very nerve-racking' but says she hopes that catching Curtis’ eye will help her launch a career in musical theatre.

Rebecca said: 'He certainly wouldn’t be a bad contact to have. There were quite a few takes but I don’t think that it was because I did anything wrong.

'I hadn’t done anything like this since school plays, and usually I was just a backing dancer or something.'

Curtis returned to Cornwall over the weekend for the premiere of the About Time, which opened in cinemas this week.

The film follows the adventures of Gleeson’s character, Tim, who discovers he can travel in time and change what has happened in his own life.

He uses his powers to romance Mary, whom he meets after moving to London to train as a lawyer.Speaking at the glitzy showbiz event in St Austell, Curtis lavished praise on Rebecca’s waitressing skills.

He said: 'She was so sweet when she was giving pizzas to our kids that we cast her in the film and she came up and acted a crucial part of a waitress in Pret A Manger.

'This was just typical of the reception we received - people were so nice that we wanted to take them with us.'
