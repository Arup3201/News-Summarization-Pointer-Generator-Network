It may seem a far-fetched idea nowadays even when it feels bitterly cold outside, but the River Thames has frozen over at least 23 times since the 1300s.

The last occurrence was two centuries ago in 1814, but in the past a number of festivals known as the River Thames Frost Fairs sprang up on the river.

The period from the mid-14th century to the 19th century in Europe was referred to as the ‘Little Ice Age’ due to the severity of the climate at the time.

Winters of old: This 1684 oil on canvas painting called 'A Frost Fair on the Thames at Temple Stairs' shows booths, coaches, sledges, sedan-chairs and groups of people

Tents: A colour aquatint showing a frost fair, entitled 'View of the Thames off Three Cranes Wharf when frozen Monday 31st January to Saturday 5th February 1814'

Impression: This caricature by George Cruikshank and Thomas Tegg is based on the 1814 fair, with people playing skittles and slipping over. A tent selling alcohol says: 'Gin and Gingerbread Sold here wholesale' and a woman near the bridge has a stall selling hot food, with the slogan: 'Here's my smoking Hot Sasengers a penney a peic'

Paintings and memorabilia owned by the Museum of London show that when the conditions were right, Londoners headed onto the river in celebration.

The first recorded frost fair did not take place until 1608, although the Thames had frozen over several times in the 16th century. 

It is said that Henry VIII travelled all the way from Central London to Greenwich by sleigh along the river during the winter of 1536.

Elizabeth I is also thought to have taken walks on the ice during the winter of 1564. Centuries later, the last frost fair was held on the Thames in 1814.

It took place from February 1 to 5, and the ice was so thick at the time that an elephant crossing was held at Blackfriars.

Meriel Jeater, the museum’s curator of
 archaeological collections, told MailOnline: ‘The Thames is first 
recorded as freezing over in the 12th century.

‘The
 first time people took to the frozen river for organised entertainments
 was 1309, where a hare was hunted with dogs (and) a fire was built on 
the ice.

Out of date: Museum of London curator Meriel Jeater holds a piece of gingerbread bought at the last Thames frost fair of 1814. It is the only surviving one of its kind

Cutlery: A souvenir silver spoon from the frost fair of 1683 inscribed with: 'This was bought at the faire kept upon the Midle of ye Thames against ye Temple'

Souvenirs: A frost fair keepsake from 1739-1740 printed on the Thames (left). The paper is printed with a central image, possibly an etching of a sailing ship leaving port, underneath which are printed the lyrics and musical score for the song 'The Adieu to Susan'. A souvenir tankard from the frost fair of 1683 is pictured (right)

‘Between 1309 
and 1814, the surface of the Thames froze over at least 23 times in the 
London area. One of the main reasons for this was not due to colder 
temperatures, as some may think.

'The Thames never froze over in the London area again (after 1831) - despite temperatures dropping to -20C at times in the notoriously cold winter of 1895'

She
 added: ‘It was actually to do with the structure of Old London Bridge 
at the time. It had 19 arches and each of the 20 piers was supported by 
large breakwaters called "starlings".

‘When
 chunks of ice got caught between them, it slowed the flow of the river 
above the bridge, making it more likely to freeze over. When New London 
Bridge opened in 1831 it only had five arches.

'Once
 this structure was in place, the Thames never froze over in the London 
area again - despite temperatures dropping to -20C at times in the 
notoriously cold winter of 1895.’

Weeks of hard frosts led to the Thames
 being frozen, with traders sensing a chance to sell souvenirs - and dozens of shops put in place overnight.

Unlicensed
 gambling, drinking and dancing were held at the fairs, along with 
stalls selling food and drink, skittle alleys and fairground rides.

Fun: In this 1677 painting by Abraham Hondius, 'The Frozen Thames, looking Eastwards towards Old London Bridge', people are shown enjoying themselves on the ice

Woodcut: An artist's impression of the frost fair on the Thames in 1715-1716. This view is taken from near Temple Stairs, with Old London Bridge in the background

Old times: An engraving of the 1814 fair, looking upstream towards Blackfriars Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral. Two tents are labelled 'Wellington' and 'Moscow'

Souvenirs
 and personalised keepsakes were also available for a
 few pennies, with printers setting up printing presses.

At
 the last fair in 1814 it was said that there were up to 10 printing 
presses in operation, also making cards and popular sheet-music of the 
time.

A caricature from that
 year’s fair showed the patriotism of the time - during the Napoleonic 
wars - with the Union Jack flag and injured war veterans.

Tents called 'Shannon' and 'Nelson' can also be seen, named after the 38-gun ship HMS Shannon and Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson.

Also featured in the Museum of London’s set of memorabilia is a souvenir silver spoon from the frost fair of 1683 to 1684.

Its inscription says: ‘This was bought at the faire kept upon the Midle of ye Thames against ye Temple in the great frost on the 29 of January 1683/4’.

An oil on canvas painting of the fair from that year shows coaches, sledges and sedan-chairs on the ice as a game of ninepins is played.
