Sunderland ended their pre-season tour of Portugal with a 0-0 draw against Vitoria Setubal in Albufeira.

The Black Cats recovered from their narrow defeat to CD Nacional last time out as they avoided a similar result against Setubal, however in truth it was a dull affair with few chances of note.

The Premier League side were very unfortunate not to receive a penalty in the second period after Adam Johnson appeared to be taken down in the box, but his protests were waved away.

Sunderland: Pantilimon, Mavrias, O’Shea, Roberge, van Aanholt, Bridcutt, Gomez, Giaccherini (Ba 76), Johnson, Wickham, Fletcher (N’Diaye 59).

Vitoria Setubal: Ricardo Baptista, Venancio, Joao, Paulo Tavares, Giovani, Miguel Pedro, Marcos, Quieros, Dani, Ney, Ziquinha.

Subs not used: Cattermole, Brown, Dixon.

The former Manchester City winger also went closest to breaking the deadlock when his long-range effort went just wide of goal.

After a quiet opening it was the home side who showed the first signs of threatening to break the deadlock, having the ball in the net as early as the 12th minute through Giovani - but the goal was correctly ruled out for offside.

Just minutes later the hosts were again unfortunate not to take the lead when Queiros' effort was brilliantly blocked by Costel Pantilimon at point blank range.

The visitors stepped up their game slightly in the second half, with Johnson's long-range strike inches away from giving the Black Cats the lead.

Poyet's side ended their three-match tour with a win, defeat and a draw, scoring one goal in the process. 

Sunderland face friendlies against Real Betis and Udinese before their season opener away at West Brom in a fortnight.
