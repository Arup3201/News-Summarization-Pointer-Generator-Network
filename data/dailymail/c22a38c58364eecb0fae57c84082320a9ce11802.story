Parents are petitioning against Tesco for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning 'may contain nuts'.

Mothers of children with nut allergies have complained that it is 'almost impossible' to feed their offspring if they take the over-cautious policy at its word. 

More than 12,500 people have signed a petition calling for the supermarket giant to 'Stop using blanket 'may contain nuts' labels'.

Parents are petitioning against Tesco for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning 'may contain nuts'

It was launched by Claire Hussein, from Portsmouth, after she said that Tesco 'dramatically changed its labelling policy'.

She said: 'Suddenly, many previously safe foods are now apparently unsafe as they have ‘may contain nuts’ on them.

'These products literally changed their allergy information overnight.

'We recognise there will be risk in some foods, such as chocolate and biscuits.

'However, when you attempt a weekly shop for your family and find that everything from baked beans to pizza, butternut squash, potatoes, fruit juice and more are suddenly labelled as being potentially unsafe it is very disruptive and leaves you with extremely limited options for feeding your family.'

Tesco said that the foods would previously have been marked as having been made in factories where nuts were also used. But it told the Times that the need for a larger font has changed the warning.

New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory.

Ms Hussein added: 'Rather than making a genuine and careful assessment of the risks, it appears that Tesco is using a blanket 'may contain nuts' policy as a legal disclaimer and to avoid having to implement the proper controls to ensure even staple items of food are safe for our children.

'I am calling on Tesco to act now to change its labelling procedures to ensure they are true reflections of risk. They need transparent traceability for all ingredients so a may contain label is only used with real need. The guidance is to prevent blanket statements - yet this appears to be the stance Tesco is taking.'

Tesco told the paper that it takes great care to label its products with allergy advice where necessary. It added: 'We only display these warnings where there is a risk of cross-contamination.'

Up to ten people a year die from reactions caused by coming into contact with even minute quantities of peanuts.

Peanut allergy, which is now thought to affect at least one in 50 children, can cause serious breathing problems.

The most severely affected could experience a life-threatening anaphylactic shock or even die when exposed to just a trace of the nuts in their food.

Sufferers have to carry an EpiPen, an autoinjector to administer adrenaline in an emergency.

But the fear of accidental exposure can reduce their quality of life and severely limit the social activities of allergic individuals, their families and even their friends.
