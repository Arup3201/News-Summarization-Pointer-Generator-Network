Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to walk on the moon, used one of the world's oldest monuments to send a message about the future of space exploration.

The 85-year-old former NASA astronaut, who touched down on the moon in 1969 with Neil Armstrong, posted a picture on Twitter of himself in front of England's Stonehenge, wearing a T-shirt reading, 'Get your a** to Mars'. 

'While at @EH_Stonehenge yesterday I decided to send a message to the cosmos,' he wrote on Tuesday, accompanying the photo.

Stonehenge, a prehistoric ring of standing stones, dates back to between 3,000 and 2,000 BC.

Aldrin's picture is the last move in his campaign for the U.S. to focus on having human settlement on Mars. 

The veteran astronaut has written a series of columns stressing that space exploration should continue. 

Aldrin has stressed numerous times over the years that space exploration needs to continue and the U.S. needs to have a goal of settling on Mars

He wrote in CNN last year: 'The moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's touchdown on the moon.

'We can make a courageous, Kennedyesque commitment to America's future in deep space. 

'The U.S. President could utter these momentous words: "I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an America-led, permanent presence on the planet Mars."'

In November of last year, he wrote a column for TIME, stressing that more people need to touch down in space. 

He wrote: 'I firmly believe we will establish permanence on that planet. And in reaching for that goal, we can cultivate commercial development of the moon, the asteroid belt, the Red Planet itself and beyond…

'We need to look forward to countries around the globe following our lead and establishing a rotating permanence on Mars for science and commercial resources.

'Some 45 years ago, when Neil Armstrong and I stepped upon the surface of the moon at Tranquility Base, we fulfilled a dream held by humankind for centuries. 

'Yes, it was one small step. Today, more steps are needed.”

Aldrin holds his doctorate in astronautics and has consulted for the U.S. government on the future of space exploration.
