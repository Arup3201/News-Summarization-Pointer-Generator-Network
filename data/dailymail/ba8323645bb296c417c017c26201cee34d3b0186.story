Debrett's Guide to Entertaining and Etiquette advises that take-out food is acceptable if served on warm plates

It would once have been considered the ultimate faux pas.

But standards have changed so much that serving takeaway food at a dinner party is now officially considered acceptable.

Phoning for a Chinese meal, curry or pizza is no longer simply the preserve of ordinary families but is catching on amongst the higher-echelons of society too.

However, the latest advice from Debrett’s, which has been the social authority on etiquette for almost 250 years, comes with one condition.

Anyone too busy to cook or surprised by the arrival of unexpected guests must always serve food on china plates - and that the plates have been warmed up.

The new guidance appears in the forthcoming Debrett’s Guide to Entertaining Etiquette and represents a major concession to custom and practice in ‘polite society.’ Another faux pas that remains out-of-order is any attempt to pass off takeaway food as your own and asking guests to pay anything is also frowned upon by the Debrett’s authors.

Johnny Roxburgh, a party planner at society caterers The Admirable Crichton, said serving takeaways to guests allowed hosts to focus on other duties to make the event go well.

‘It’s about your friends being with you, and if you’re a better, less stressed host, then why not order in? As long as it’s served on good china.’

Polly Betton, a professional party organiser from Tea Time Productions, believes there is never an excuse for ordering takeaway.

‘People don’t always expect home-made fresh bread when they come round, but everyone has a car or can reach a shop to get some ingredients,’ she said.

Jo Bryant, an etiquette adviser at Debrett’s, said: ‘Even if you are forced to order a takeaway, you can still be a good host by making an occasion of it, allowing your guest to choose the cuisine and by digging out your own chopsticks.

‘Good entertaining etiquette isn’t about adhering to an outmoded code of conduct, it’s about doing your utmost to ensure your guests are well looked after and enjoying themselves.’ Debrett’s has also broadened the boundaries of acceptable etiquette by giving the go ahead to eating certain foods, such as pizza, with your fingers, especially in informal situations such as barbeques.

Other advice in the book includes, how to cope ‘when all goes wrong,’ the correct way to serve tea and how to ensure guests do not overstay their welcome.

A recent survey of 3,000 people in the UK found that 12 per cent had ordered a takeaway and passed it off as their own, and one in ten had even roped in their mothers to cook a meal, then taken credit for it.
