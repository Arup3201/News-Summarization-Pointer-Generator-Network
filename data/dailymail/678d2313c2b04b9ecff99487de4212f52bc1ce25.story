Tragic: Wales manager Gary Speed

Wales football manager Gary Speed left the bulk of his £1.3 million fortune to the wife who found him dead.

The 42-year-old was discovered hanged by wife Louise at the family home near Chester in November last year.

His will, drawn up by Royal bankers Coutts, shows he left an estate worth £1,332,617. The figure was reduced to £1,284,472 after liabilities were paid.

A total of £325,000 – the threshold before inheritance tax is charged – was left in trust to Mrs Speed and the couple’s two sons, Tom, 13, and Edward, 14.

The remaining £959,472 was left in a separate trust for Mrs Speed. As a spouse, she will not have to pay any inheritance tax.

However, the figures refer only to the former Leeds United midfielder’s assets held in the UK, and do not include a property he owned in France.

Mrs Speed – who admitted her husband had sent her a text message threatening to commit suicide four days before he  died – was also left all of his ‘personal chattels’.

He had requested that she distribute them to people according to any wishes made while he was alive.

Mr Speed was found dead on the morning of November 27 last year. His will had been drawn up a year earlier.

Last
January, coroner Nicholas Rheinberg recorded a narrative verdict on Mr 
Speed’s death – saying there was not sufficient evidence to prove he 
intended to commit suicide and that his death may have been an accident.

Happily married: The footballer with his wife Louise, who he left the bulk of his fortune to

During the inquest, the hearing heard how Mrs Speed discovered her husband's body.

His friends denied the footballer was depressed but his wife admitted he had sent her a text threatening suicide just four days before his death.

Mr Speed played 85 times  for Wales before becoming manager of the national team.
