This greedy gator nearly bit off more than he could shoe, but left doubters dumbfounded after swallowing a bright pink flip flop whole.

The huge alligator was spotted eyeing up the strange snack before chomping down on the flip flop and gobbling up the entire shoe in one big gulp.

Stunned snapper, Phil Lanoue, lives just metres from the salt marshes in Huntington Beach State Park, Murrells Inlet, South Carolina where the incredible images were taken.

Hungry: This greedy gator saw a pink flip-flop as a meal

Jaws-some: The huge alligator was spotted eyeing up the strange snack before chomping down on it in Huntington Beach State Park in South Carolina

The gator was spotted by Phil Lanoue, who lives just metres from the salt marshes the reptile frequents

Phil, who was just a few feet away from the action, said he often came face to face with hungry alligators on the hunt for food but was shocked to see this one polish off the rubbery flip flip in a matter of seconds.

He said: ‘I was watching this alligator as it slowly floated around in the marsh pond.

‘I could immediately tell something along the edge of the pond caught his attention as he started going into a stealthy stalking mode.

Fishing: Maybe the alligator was looking for some sole

Surprised: The photographer was convinced the alligator would spit the shoe out

Flip flops might be too much even for an alligators sturdy stomach

‘I figured he had spotted a crab or big fish and was headed over to see if he could snag it.

‘There was some sort of pink coloured debris there in the reeds that I had previously noticed but I didn't think the gator was interested in that.

‘Well it turns out that was precisely what caught the alligator's attention and once he grabbed it and lifted it up, I recognized it as a pink rubber flip flop sandal.

‘At this point I assumed he would bite down on the shoe, realize it was inedible, and spit it back out.

Down the hatch: In the end the animal swallowed the flip flop - but later had a confused look on its face, according to the photographer who took these shots of it

‘But to my surprise he proceeded to carry the flip flop out from the reeds and back into the pond.

‘I was still waiting for him to discard the rubber shoe but to my horror the alligator chewed down on the pink sandal a few more times before finally gulping it down whole.

‘I know that alligators will pick up and sometimes eat all sorts of things but I'm not sure if it can successfully break down and pass a rubber shoe, or if it will clog up the alligator's digestive system.

‘After swallowing the flip flop the alligator floated over near to my location and had a bit of a confused look on his face as if he was trying to decide if perhaps eating that shoe may not have been a wise decision.

‘I've been keeping my eye out for him ever since and will continue to do so.’
