The BBC is facing a difficult decision about whether it should play a Wizard Of Oz track which has had a 
surge of popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death.

An online campaign has driven sales 
of the song - today midweek placings released by the Official Charts Company 
show Judy Garland's Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead is now at number 10.

The corporation will now have to decide if they will play the 1939 tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown when places are finalised at the weekend.

The BBC said: 'The Official Chart Show 
on Sunday is a historical and factual account of what the British public
 has been buying and we will make a decision about playing it when the 
final chart positions are clear.'

The late former prime minister 
divided opinion and while many have mourned, many have also seen her 
death as a cause for celebration.

The song is expected to remain in the upper reaches when the official chart is announced on Sunday.

It is also currently at number two in the iTunes download chart.

The
 song features in the 1939 musical The Wizard of Oz and is sung by 
Dorothy, played by Judy Garland, the Munchkins and Glinda the Good 
Witch, played by Billie Burke.

Baroness Thatcher's death could propel The Wizard Of Oz track Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead into the top 40 of the singles chart

There has been some speculation that it may be too short to qualify at just 51 seconds, but chart bosses say it is eligible.

In 2007 the track The Ladies Bras by Wisbey made the chart despite lasting just 36 seconds.

Garland's version is not the only one to be selling

A performance by Ella Fitzgerald is at 146 and one by the Munchkins is at 183.

It comes as violence erupted on the streets at special 'death parties' held to celebrate the passing of Baroness Thatcher.

It has raised security concerns about next week’s funeral, with increasing fears that militant groups, anti-austerity protesters or even dissident Irish Republicans might try to disrupt the occasion.

One police source said senior officers had initially been ‘quite relaxed’  about the operation to protect Wednesday’s farewell to the former prime minister, but had hardened their view as disorder broke out.

The funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral now looks likely to present a security challenge unparalleled since the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 and Sir Winston Churchill in 1965.
