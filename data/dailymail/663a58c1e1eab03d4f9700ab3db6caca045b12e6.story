These pictures show how a Catholic monastery which was owned by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I has been converted into a luxury home with a £5.5million price tag.

Horton Priory in Ashford, Kent was built in the 12th century - although within its grounds are parts of a settlement dating back as far as the early Iron Age.

The complex was originally owned by King Henry I, but he later handed it over to the Cluniac order of monks to be converted into a medieval priory.

After the dissolution of the monasteries it was seized by Henry VIII, who passed it on to his daughter Elizabeth before the home was given to the Mantell family in 1970.

The Grade I-listed mansion is situated in 55 acres of land, and has undergone a thorough makeover to turn it into a modern home. It now boasts a private cinema, wine cellar, swimming pool, 11 bedrooms and even a driving range.

For sale: Horton Priory, a house in Kent once owned by three different monarchs, is on the market for £5.5million

Fit for a king: The home, which dates back to the 12th century, still retains much of its pre-modern charm

Comfortable: The interiors of the home are now a far cry from when it was the spartan setting for a Cluniac monastery

Great hall: The home is centred around a long gallery which would once have been where the monks took their meals

Mod cons: Horton Priory has now been redesigned to make it fit for modern living with luxury bathrooms

Owners: King Henry I, left, and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, right, and two of the distinguished former inhabitants of the home

Royals: Henry VIII took control of the priory 
after the dissolution of the monasteries and later passed it to his 
daughter Elizabeth I

Expensive: But the price tag is justified by the home's bucolic setting and outdoor swimming pool

Convenient: Despite the home's historic interest, it still had to be renovated to meet the expectations of modern buyers

Grand: The reading room and library of the house, which was once owned by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I before passing into private hands

Picturesque: The living room of the house looks out onto the grounds, which span 55 acres including a variety of orchards

Pond: A miniature lake with a bird house takes up part of the land surrounding the mansion

Fore! The house includes a driving range for its wealthy new owner to practice his golf putting

Take a dip: The installation of a swimming pool was part of the programme of improvements which turned the priory into a luxury house

Dining room: The house contains an original 14th-century fireplace which would once have been a major focal point for residents

Games: One room features a snooker table for the use of the new multi-millionaire owner

Thirsty: Horton Priory has an air-conditioned wine cellar which has space for hundreds of bottles

Relaxation: A spare bedroom in the house, which has a total of 11 bedrooms and is Grade I-listed

Panelling: The living room contains wood panels in the Tudor style of its former royal owners

Austere: This hallway gives an indication of the sparse conditions once endured by the monks at Horton

Entrance: The gates to Horton Priory, controlled by the Cluniac order of monks before the dissolution of the monasteries

Sport: The priory, which is made up of multiple houses, has its own croquet field

Parking: Perhaps the ultimate sign of modernity is shown in the fact that the house has parking for multiple cars
