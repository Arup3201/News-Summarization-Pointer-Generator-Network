A Brooklyn hipster and new dad learned that beards and babies don't get along and so he decided to shave the facial hair he sported for most of his adult life and devise a way to preserve it forever.

Luke Hughett didn't realize his beard would be such a target for his baby daughter Willa who tugs on it, spits up on it, and bursts into tears if it gets too close to her face.

'She pulls on it. It's a magnet. It gets in her face it annoys her. It's like a target,' he said.

In her face: Hughett's beard gets in his daughter's face and annoys her to the brink of tears 

The hairy decision: Luke Hughett had to make the decision between keeping his beard and terrorizing his baby daughter or shaving off the facial hair he's had for most of his adult life and creating less of a boundary 

Frightened: Hughett's beard frightens his daughter Willa who scowls when she looks up at it 

Messy beard: Hughett's baby Willa spits up on his beard and also likes to tug on it because it makes her cry  

Close shave: Hughett has his beard and mustache shaved off in one piece so that he can execute his plan

Team effort: It took a team of barbers to ensure that the beard was snipped off in just one piece 

While shaving would make being a father easier, Hughett said that shaving it would be like 'an amputation of (his) soul.'

Hughett had an idea that he thought might appease both he and his daughter and while it meant shaving his beard it also meant saving it.

'There's gotta be a way I can keep both my baby and my beard,' he said.

After having a barber trim both his beard and mustache in just one piece, he had an artist preserve the beard in a 45-block of solid Lucite, reports Gothamist.

While his fiancé Erin thought him strange for so desperately holding on to his beard, baby Willa took lovingly to daddy's baby face.

'Now that I don't have a beard it's been great with Willa. I can put my face right up next to hers and she likes it. There's not this barrier between us anymore.'

Now Hughett kisses his baby goodnight and then goes to kiss his other prized possession, the beard he had permanently preserved in Lucite so he'll never have to part with it even after his baby becomes an adult and leaves home.  

Baby faced: Now without his beard on his face, Luke Hughett decided to put his beard in a place where he could hold onto it forever 

The plan: Luke Hughett brought his beard to a friend who worked to preserve it in a block of Lucite 

The final result: Now Luke Hughett keeps his beard on his bedside table so he can look at it every day 

Goodnight baby: Luke Hughett kisses his daughter to sleep with his newly smooth face but he still has one more kiss to give before going to bed
