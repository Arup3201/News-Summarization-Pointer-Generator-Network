A mother of three lay dead beneath six feet of rubbish for 19 months before anyone noticed she was there, an inquest has heard.

The skeletal remains of Julie Ann Watson, 37, were found curled in a foetal position beneath a pile of bin bags to the rear of a derelict house, yards from where she lived in South Belfast.

Her body was so badly decomposed no cause of death could be determined and authorities had to resort to calling in an archaeologist to help with post-mortem examinations.

'A desperately sad and shocking case': Coroner 
Jim Kitson, sitting at Belfast Coroner's Court, could not determine the 
cause of Julie Ann Watson's death because her remains were so badly decayed

'This is a desperately sad and tragic case,' said Belfast Coroner Jim Kitson. 'It is also in some ways shocking that the body of a young woman of some 37 years of age can lie undiscovered for a period of 19 months.'

Ms Watson was last seen alive in August 2009 and her final bank activity was a month later, police said.

The heavy-drinking mother may have died from sniffing solvents after an aerosol can was found beside her, a pathologist said, but he was unable to make a definitive finding because the body was so badly decayed.

The coroner could not determine a cause of death.

'It appears quite clear that Julie's life was out of control and sadly it appears Julie was in the grips of some sort of alcoholism or addiction,' Mr Kitson said.

Her brother William Watson had not seen her since 2006 and a close friend said she had become afraid to leave her home.

Nicola Johnston recalled her drinking from morning to night, litre after litre of cider. 'She was sitting crying like a baby,' Ms Johnston added.

Ms Watson was only found after an elderly neighbour complained about the growing piles of rubbish at the property on Donegall Avenue, which the inquest heard was a common spot for fly-tipping.

Her body was covered in several old fractures from an accident or assault, pathologist Dr Alistair Bentley said, including a bone in her neck broken by pressure.

None of these injuries caused her death and had happened a considerable time beforehand, the expert added.

An archaeology expert had to be brought in to identify the different fractures, which may have been caused by falls linked to excessive drinking.

Miss Watson had a difficult start to life and was put into foster care after her parents split, her brother said. She later went through a divorce, descending into a spiral of depression and alcoholism, the inquest heard.

'She thought the whole world was against her,' Mr Watson recalled.

After her divorce she 'dropped off the radar', the coroner said. She stayed with friends or in hostels but later moved into a property at Kitchener Street, close to where her body was found, with a friend called Joseph Blair.

He told police she tended to leave for weeks at a time and he did not consider them to be in a relationship. After she disappeared in August 2009 he assumed she was living somewhere else.

He was interviewed by police but a detective told the inquest his account was plausible and there were no signs of a crime having been committed.

Dr Bentley said: 'Within the limits imposed by the degree of decomposition there was nothing that I found to suggest that she had been the victim of a homicide.'

Her bones were found curled in a foetal position with an aerosol and plastic bag close.

A pathologist said she may have been inhaling the gases of the spray, which can interfere with the heart beat, but it was not possible to analyse for the toxic substances.

The coroner said it was clear she was not the victim of a murder.

'Her death will remain undetermined due to advanced decomposition,' he added.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
