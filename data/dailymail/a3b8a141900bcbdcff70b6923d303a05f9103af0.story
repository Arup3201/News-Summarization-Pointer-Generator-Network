The number of step families has slumped by 14 per cent in a decade, as women delay having children, new figures show.

The changing face of Britain’s families was revealed by data showing there were 544,000 families with children living with a stepparent in 2011, down from 631,000 ten years earlier.

Couples who move in together with children from previous relationships are also being priced out parts of the country, because need larger homes with more bedrooms.

The proportion of stepfamilies is lowest in London and the South East, where house prices are higher, suggesting larger families are being priced out of some areas

Between 2001 and 2011 the number of families where children lived with both parents rose by 4 per cent.

But at the same time the number of stepfamilies fell by 14 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said.

The dramatic change could be linked to several factors, including the decline in the number of children born to younger parents who are more likely to split up.

The ONS said there were ‘no clear reasons’ for the fall in the number of stepfamilies but possible factors include a rise in the average age at which women have their first baby.

‘This means that children are less likely to be born to younger couples who are more likely to break up. This may lessen the chance of children becoming stepchildren later on,’ the ONS said.

Single parents may also be increasingly likely to have a partner who lives elsewhere and essentially acts as a stepparent to their children without living with them permanently.

Some 85 per cent of stepfamilies include children from the woman’s previous relationship, 11m-er cent included children from the man’s previous relationship and 4 per cent from both partners’ previous relationships, according to the General Lifestyle Survey in 2011 for Great Britain.

Almost one in 10 children lives in a stepfamily, the Office for National Statistics said

Suprrisngly, the proportion of stepfamilies varied across the country with numbers lowest in London and the South East where property prices are highest.

The ONS said: ‘The lowest proportions of couple families with dependent children which were stepfamilies in 2011 were in and to the west of London, extending along the M4 corridor.

‘Meanwhile, the highest proportions were in coastal areas, south Wales, Norfolk and the East Midlands.

‘Several reasons may contribute to this pattern including the presence of affordable housing because stepfamilies tend to be larger.

‘For example, the cost of homes with enough bedrooms to accommodate children may prevent some people who both have children from moving in together in London and the South East.’

Among stepfamilies where the parents have married, 28 per cent have three or more dependent children compared with 17 per cent of married couple non-stepfamilies.

Stepfamilies tend to be larger, in part because they can include children from both previous relationships

‘This may be expected as some couples may have one or more children from a previous relationship and go on to have another child within their current relationship,’ the ONS said.

‘Alternatively, children may come from both partners’ previous relationships.’

The number of stepfamilies in an area could also be linked to the number of lone parents.

‘People from certain ethnic groups may have a lower likelihood of divorcing or having children outside marriage, and so of forming stepfamilies. These groups are not evenly spread around the country,’ the ONS added.

In England and Wales 1.1 million of children lived in a stepfamily in 2011, equivalent to 9 per cent.

A total of 7.7 million, or 64 per cent, of children lived with both of their parents and 3.1 million or 26 per cent lived with a single parent.

The majority of children living in stepfamilies lived with parents who have married - 689,000 compared to 418,000 where the parents in the stepfamily have not tied the knot.
