She is the model of the moment, with millions of girls worldwide desperate to emulate her distinct look.

And now, celebrity make-up artist Lisa Eldridge has revealed exactly how to recreate Cara Delevingne's model make-up at home.

Lisa was inundated with requests asking her to re-create the look she gave Cara at a recent party, so she has shared her step-by-step guide, favourite products and hints and tips exclusively with FEMAIL.

'I've done Cara's make-up lots of times and I love working with her, she's really polite, super intelligent and a lot of fun, so I really like doing her make-up.

'But I had so many requests for this one particular look that I did on her for a party recently. It's a nice make-up look, it can work on lots of different skin tones and faces. It's not about looking like Cara but more about recreating the look for yourself at home,' said Lisa.

In her tutorial, she suggests starting with L'Oreal Infallible Foundation in Golden Beige. 'Put a really nice thin layer all over using a big fat buffing brush to really buff the product out.

'Use a clean brush, that way you get to spread the foundation without building up more and more of the product,' she explains.

She then applies Nars Pro Prime Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base to hold the eye make-up in place.

'Cara wore a silver suit to the party so I wanted a little bit in her make-up but without matching too much.

'So I used this metallic almost greeny, silvery grey Chanel Illusion d'Ombre Eye Shadow, which I applied fairly strongly all over Cara's eyelid to give a great metallic sheen,' she said.

She then applied Maybelline New York Colour Tattoo 24hr Gel-Cream Eyeshadow in Charcoal to create more definition along Cara's socket line.

To conceal the post-Fashion Week bags under her eyes, she mixed Clinique Airbursh Concealer with Laura Mercier Secret Camoflage, which she smoothed under Cara's eyes.

To achieve the smoky eye look, Lisa applied Benefit BADgal Waterproof liner along Cara's lower and upper lashline, which she smudged to soften.

Lisa then curled her eyelashes and applied plenty of CoverGirl Lashblast Volume Mascara before dropping on three medium length individual lashes just at the outer corner, to help give that 'nice winged effect'.

To give Cara her glow, she applied Tom Ford Shade & Illuminate, which also she used to contour the face.

'I buff it under the cheekbone and go right back into the hairline to soften everything off, coming slightly onto the temple as well to give really great definition,' explains Lisa.

She then adds Benefit's Watt's Up! Highlighter, which she says has a really nice golden warmth to it, and finally sets everything with some Chanel loose powder.

Lisa says: 'With Cara, it's all about the brows. I used a Suqqu pen to give them more strength and definition.

'It's quite time consuming as you're literally adding hair by hair but it's the most convinving way of getting a natural full-looking brow; keep brushing through as you're building.'

To achieve Cara's nude lip look, she applies No7 Precision Lips Pencil in Nude to give definition and as a final touch, she adds a little bit of highlighter at the inner eyes.

Lisa has also worked with Kate Winslet, Katy Perry, Keira Knightley, Emma Watson, Cameron Diaz, , Kate Moss and Cate Blanchet.
