The 36-year-old comic’s release is based on performances during his sell-out ten-night show at the O2 in London and his 71 date round-Britain tour.

'This year Michael McIntyre is the No 1 best seller, but not far behind is Kevin Bridges, whose popularity has surged this year.

'We staged an instore DVD signing in Kevin’s hometown HMV in Glasgow and nearly a thousand fans turned up, which was amazing.

'Mrs Brown’s Boys just keeps going from

Whitehall has really burst through in a big way - partly because of his 
Fresh Meat and Bad Education sitcoms.'
