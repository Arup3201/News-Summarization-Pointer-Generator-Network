An unemployed father of 26 children, who has already raked in benefits worth more than £500,000, says he deserves more money to support his huge family.

Unmarried Peter Rolfe, 64, from the Isle of Wight has fathered 14 boys and 12 girls with 15 different women.

He appeared on today's This Morning to defend his lifestyle, ahead of a Channel 5 documentary airing this evening sharing his story.

His side of the story: Peter Rolfe said on This Morning he only takes benefits for the sake of his children

Presenter Holly Willoughby revealed that Peter is getting £32,678 a year in benefits in the form of  child tax credits, family allowance, disability benefits, housing benefits and a state pension.

Peter pointed out that the pension is his right given he worked in his youth as a doorman (a role he admitted was largely responsible for him sleeping with so many women and fathering so many children).

He apologised if his large family puts a 'strain' on the benefits system but added that he only claims for his children's sake, not for his own.

Disabilities: The father of 26 said he would get a job if he could

'I claim exactly what I can get from the state for my children, not for my self,' he said.

He added that he would work if he could.

'I worked until taking the children on and then I became a single father, if someone wants to give me a job I'll do it, even now with my disabilities but noone wants to give a disabled person a job,' he said.

While some of Mr Rolfe's children have grown up and left home (his eldest daughter is in her forties), he still regularly has 18 family members staying in his three-bed council house. Six of his children aged three to 19 still live with him permanently.

Hard life: Peter Rolfe says he needs a bigger council house and more benefits to support his family

Big brood: The father of 26 with some of his children (he has 14 boys and 12 girls altogether)

And the family keeps on expanding - one of his teenage daughters has just had twins.

As a result, Mr Rolfe says there simply isn't room for them all, they have to top and tail to share beds while he sleeps on the sofa.

'I would like a house with four bedrooms 
big enough to accommodate the children,' he explained on the Channel 5 documentary.

He said he has been waiting nine years for a bigger house. 'I'll be dead before they even 
think about giving me a house,' he moans.

Tight squeeze: Peter's council house on the Isle Of Wight isn't big enough for his family (they do not own the attached garage)

Mr Rolfe's feckless behaviour has already invited the ire of taxpayers but he declares himself furious with local council leader, who recently awarded himself a 37 per cent pay rise.

'Why is he entitled to that when I'm 
not entitled to a bigger bedroom?' he complains.

'He didn't do anything to deserve what 
he's getting. All he's doing is getting money for nothing, what makes 
him think he's worth that money?'

In addition to demanding more money and a larger home, Mr Rolfe complains that he and his family have been struggling since the benefit cap came in.

Furiously, he tells of how his children had to go without computer games because they were only getting £500 a week in benefits.

Challenge: Peter said people who criticise him should imagine what it's like being a father of 26

'When the cap came in, we lost at least 
£200 a week,' he fumes. 'It meant some of my children couldn't have a new pair of 
shoes, couldn't have a new pair of school trousers, couldn't have stuff 
other children get such as Playstations and Xboxes... None of my children have had 
them and that's because we can't afford them.

'Before the cap we were able to live comfortably, it's a major drop that affected us right away. They didn't 
drop the price of food, that's going up so you have a lot of worry and 
you have to juggle everything you can.'

Yet when their benefits were capped, Mr Rolfe and other members of his family decided not to make up the shortfall by getting a job.

At the time
 the documentary was filmed, his teenage daughter, Rosanne, was the only
 one employed - but she quit her waitressing job after five shifts saying it
 was too difficult.

'Everyone has judged for for it but I 
hated it, I honestly did,' she explains. 'All the people there would talk down to me, I
 would prefer to work a simple 9-5, no split shifts.'

Upwardly mobile on benefits: Peter has successfully applied for disability allowance which means his family gets £800 a week (and he gets a mobility scooter)

Mr Rolfe, who walks using a stick, has now managed to boost his weekly welfare payout to £800 a week again - after successfully claiming disability allowance.

But for anyone who thinks he's got it easy, he points out it's hard work being a father to dozens of children.

'I would challenge anybody to come and do what I do for the children. People all criticise me, but come and do what I do,' he said.

But following his appearance on This Morning, Peter again received a barrage of criticism from viewers who contacted the show via Twitter.

Kim Foster angrily rote: 'Shocking! He gets more than I do, and I'm a full time nurse! Saved wages for a house deposit and it's handed to him!' while Sarah Hawkins said: 'There's just no excuse. The Government needs to be more stricted with benefits. I'm a single parent and work my butt off.'
