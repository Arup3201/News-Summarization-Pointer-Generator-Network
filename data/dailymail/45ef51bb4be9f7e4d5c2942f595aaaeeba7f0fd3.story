Jailed: Illegal immigrant Eduard Mereohra, 26, ran away from the scene after ploughing into David and Dorothy Metcalf's car on New Year¿s Day

The family of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant drink-driver have blamed Britain’s shambolic border controls.

Failed asylum seeker Eduard Mereohra, 26, was kicked out of the country in 2009 but slipped back in just months later.

On New Year’s Day, still drunk from a party the night before, he ploughed into a car carrying grandparents David and Dorothy Metcalf, killing them both and tearing a loving family apart.

Yesterday, after he was jailed for nine years, the couple’s family said they would still be alive today if the immigration system had not let them down.

They demanded an official investigation into how the Moldovan national was able to make a mockery of our border controls.

The court was told that Mereohra had even obtained a work permit and national insurance number under his real name, but last night this was disputed by the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions.

Outside court the couple’s son Clive said: ‘Mum and Dad were hard-working, honest taxpayers who had planned responsibly for their retirement and should have had 20-plus more years to enjoy together.

‘While we hold Mereohra responsible for his actions, we feel that our beloved mum and dad would still be alive today if the system had not failed by allowing him to be at liberty in the UK.

‘We were a very close family and we are lost without them. No sentence will ever be long enough for the person who changed our lives for ever on New Year’s Day 2012, when he took away our parents and our children’s grandparents, through his thoughtless, dangerous and illegal actions.’

Mereohra arrived in Britain in October 2008, and claimed asylum the following year. His claim was refused and he was removed to Austria, where he had earlier claimed asylum, in December 2009.But in April 2010 he sneaked back  into this country in a lorry driven by a Romanian.

Crash: The Metcalfs' Fiatwas lifted into the air after it was hit by Mereohra's Volvo on the Stanningley by-pass Leeds

At the time of the crash he was living in Burley, Leeds, and working as a labourer. On New Year’s Day, still drunk on beer, whisky and champagne from a party the night before, he took the wheel of  his Volvo C70.

Witnesses described him driving at high speed along a dual carriage- way outside Leeds, tailgating and forcing other motorists to swerve out of the way.

He ploughed into the back of the Metcalfs’ Fiat Panda at around 100mph, hurling it 10ft into the air and flipping it end over end.

Mr Metcalf, 68, from Leeds, who was driving, was thrown from the vehicle and died instantly. His 65-year-old wife was found hanging out of a rear window and died later.

Mereohra, who was twice the legal drink drive limit, tried to run away but was restrained by a bystander.

Later he tried to blame the incident on Mr Metcalf, a retired maintenance engineer.

Yesterday at Leeds Crown Court he was sentenced to nine years for causing death by dangerous driving, which he admitted at an earlier hearing.

Passing sentence, Judge Geoffrey Marson said Mereohra had made a ‘deliberate decision to drive aggressively’ and had used his car like a weapon.

Angry: David and Dorothy Metcalf's son Clive said his parents would still be alive but for the failure of immigration officials

Afterwards Clive Metcalf said: ‘We have been told that he is sorry, but we simply cannot accept that as a genuine apology.

‘He chose to come to this country illegally; he chose to drink all night and get behind the wheel of his car; he chose to drive erratically and at extremely high speed, weaving in and out of traffic; he chose to flee the scene of this horrific incident and denied being the driver and refused to be tested for alcohol.

‘Given those circumstance, we think the only thing he is sorry about is that he was caught.’ The family’s MP Greg Mulholland called for a full investigation of the ‘catalogue of failures’ in the case.

The Lib Dem member for Leeds North West said Mereohra had been caught speeding just weeks before the incident ‘but nothing was flagged up’ and he was able to continue driving.

He said: ‘The simple fact is that if these deeply concerning errors had not occurred, Mereohra would not have been in this country, let alone driving on our roads, and David and Dorothy Metcalf would have still been with us today.

‘Although he has been sentenced to nine years, it is likely he will only serve half of that and will then be deported.’

The court was told Mereohra had obtained a work permit and national insurance number, although officials could last night find no trace of him in Government records.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that Mereohra  has never held permission to work in the UK.‘He is not an European Economic Area national, and he has never been granted any leave (as a person subject to control under the 1971 Immigration Act) from which he would qualify either to claim benefits or seek employment.’A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We can  find no record of this man on our NI records.‘We will investigate to see if he did obtain an NI number and whether it was by fraudulent means.’
