An MP last night accused Channel 4 of commissioning a ‘loaded’ documentary on the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards that will be presented by Hugh Grant.

Alun Cairns has written to its chief executive, David Abraham, asking how a programme fronted by the actor ‘will ever comply with Ofcom’s rules about impartiality’.

Mr Grant, who has become the public face of the Hacked Off pressure group demanding Press reform, is making the documentary.

MP Alun Cairns questioned whether a documentary on the Leveson Inquiry presented by Hugh Grant, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign demanding Press reform, can comply with Ofcom's impartiality rules

The production company, Films of Record, was founded by Roger Graef, who is its chief executive.

He was, until yesterday, also chairman of the Media Standards Trust, which founded Hacked Off.

In his letter, which has been copied to Ofcom chief Ed Richards, Tory MP Mr Cairns says he is ‘extremely concerned’ about the programme.

He details the links between Mr Grant, the production company and the MST which, the politician points out, has ‘produced a series of recommendations for a system of statutory regulation of the Press which Hacked Off and Hugh Grant support’.

Mr Cairns continues: ‘The celebrity spokesman of Hacked Off making the case for the implementation of the MST’s proposals is none other than Hugh Grant – the chosen celebrity presenter of the programme. It is little wonder why he accepted the very kind invitation from Films of Record to front the programme.’

Campaign: Hugh Grant said that Government intervention is necessary on the Andrew Marr show

The MP for the Vale of Glamorgan says he has seen an email from the producer of the programme which states: ‘The film follows Hugh Grant as he investigates what forces may be ranged against his campaign to make the Press more accountable…’

Mr Cairns says he suspects Mr Graef’s resignation as head of the Trust is ‘an attempt to hide conflicts of interest which brought this programme about’.

Mr Cairns quotes Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code which states broadcasters ‘should not give undue prominence to the views of particular persons or bodies on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy’.

The MP wants Mr Abraham to answer:

Celebrity status: Mr Cairns said the matter is too important to depend on celebrity support

Last night Mr Cairns said: ‘It’s important that we consider the Leveson Inquiry objectively. It’s too important to depend on celebrity support. The issue goes to the heart of journalism and uncovers some of the most difficult issues.’

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘The programme will be impartial in line with Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code.’

The MST website yesterday announced: ‘Helena Kennedy QC is temporarily taking over the Chair of the Media Standards Trust, as Roger Graef, the founder of Films of Record, has stepped aside due to broadcasting commitments.

‘Ten Alps/Films of Record has been commissioned to make a programme about the Leveson Inquiry, and although Roger Graef is not involved, he wants no suggestion that there may be any conflict of interest with the Media Standards Trust.’
