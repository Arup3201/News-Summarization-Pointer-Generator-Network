Desperate parents who spent thousands of pounds trying to get hold of
a rare toy only to find out it was not actually on sale have slammed the
maker of collectibles Moshi Monsters.

The firm behind the children's online craze had claimed that 16 of the sought-after figures were available, hidden inside blister packs.

However, mums and dads under pressure from their children to complete the whole set were unable to find the final character - the elusive Snozzle Wobbleson.

Elusive: Desperate parents spent thousands of pounds trying to find the Snozzle Wobbleson only for manufacturers to admit that it was not on sale

After an angry online backlash from parents, Moshi Monsters creators Mind Candy and toymakers Vivid admitted that the green bobble-headed figure was not even on sale.

Collectors of the popular figurines had snapped up 'Blind Bags' containing two hidden monsters for £2, or four, plus a hidden character for £5, in the hope of collecting each of the Series Five 'Moshlings' after they were released in January.

They trawled toyshops, newsagents and the internet for the the jellyfish-like creature with big red googly eyes, described as the 'owner of the Gross-ery Store' - but to no avail.

The toys are aimed at children aged between six and 14 and are based on characters from an online game where youngsters can care for and nurture monsters as pets.

Angry parents took to Twitter and the Moshi Monsters Facebook page to complain that they could not find the 'ultra rare character', until Vivid and Mind Candy admitted the mistake.

One father, Derek McKenna, estimated that he had spent thousands of pounds on Moshi toys for his daughter.

'My daughter has every figure, in 
more than one colour, having friends in all local toy shops, not one has
been found, having checked blind bags, and I mean 100s, both bought and
felt inside, its not here, and purchased many 5 packs, I have to 
question its availability,' he wrote on the Moshi Monsters Facebook 
page.

Mother Megan Tini wrote: 'Was he even in the packs? I must have spent about £100 plus 
trying to find him in packs.

'I don't believe for a second he was out 
there?!? Very disappointed!'

Vivid said that it was trying to get more Snozzles into shops, and 
blamed a production error for the fact that none of them had been 
available.

'Thanks to our devoted fans, we were made aware that Moshi collectors were struggling to find 'Ultra Rare' Moshling Snozzle Wobbleson in packs," said a Vivid spokesman.

'After further investigation, we identified a production error, which we have been working hard to get resolved as quickly as possible.

'We sincerely apologise for this temporary issue.'

Collectors then blasted manufacturers for sending them on a wild Snozzle chase.

Matthew Cook wrote: 'Think the person responsible for
this should resign.

'This is sooo much bigger than the banking crisis to
little fans and the parents who have foolishly fallen in love with a 
plastic mould that does nothing.

Sarah Foran posted: 'I think it is disgraceful, we had to go round numerous shops
constantly on the search for this one last moshling that my son 
wanted.

'There was no way of us knowing that we were on a wasted mission 
and how is a young child suppossed to understand that he can't actually 
get the one that is on the pack as he has on previous series.

'Lots of my
time wasted, I personally will be steering my children away from this 
franchise as it clearly does not appreciate its fan base.'

Helen Ruggles said: 'Glad vivid have listened! Still think all the money
people have spent on thinking they are out there then make out they 
have been released when they clearly have not is very naughty.'

Mind Candy and Vivid have invited fans in England and Wales to attend a one-off 'Snozzle Saturday' event in The Entertainer toy shops where it would be possible to bring along spare Moshling figures to trade for a free Snozzle Wobbleson.

'We apologise to our loyal fans for any inconvenience or upset caused regarding Snozzle Wobbleson figurines,' said a Mind Candy spokesman.

'Our toy partner Vivid do a fantastic 
job of creating exciting Moshi toys and we hope the 'Snozzle Saturday' 
events go some way to rectifying this issue before the character hits 
shelves.'
