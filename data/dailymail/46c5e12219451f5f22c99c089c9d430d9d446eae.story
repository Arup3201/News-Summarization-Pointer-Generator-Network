New pictures have emerged of the wreckage of the Costa Concordia showing the bridge where Captain Francesco Schettino tried to impress his lover the night the vessel crashed.

Dancer Domnica Cemortan had been for dinner with the captain before she joined him on the bridge, as he attempted a close sail-past of the Tuscan island of Giglio.

But the luxury liner crashed into a reef on the night of January 13, 2012, with 4,229 people from 70 countries on board in a disaster that claimed 32 lives.

The Costa Concordia has remained stricken off the island of Giglio since it crashed in 2012

It is thought that the Moldovan dancer was among several 'unauthorised' people who were on the bridge at the time the Concordia smashed into rocks off the Italian island of Giglio, tearing a 70m hole in its hull, just two hours after starting a Mediterranean cruise .

The new pictures of the interior of the wreckage have been released to the media by the Court of Grosseto following the close of the official inquiry into the disaster.

Schettino is currently on trial for manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning the vessel before all passengers had evacuated.

The images also show several other areas inside the crusie ship, which were destroyed in the disaster.

In addition footage has also emerged showing divers attaching massive flotation tanks ready to raise the stricken vessel, which is set to make its final voyage to a scrapyard in Genoa on Tuesday.

The pictures show the divers securing large chains around the part sunken Costa Concordia which allowed flotation tanks to be attached to the wreck.

The operation to salvage the ship is one of the largest in history and a new video has been released showing the underwater work

The operation to salvage the ship is one of the largest in history and saw air pumped into 30 large metal boxes, which were attached to the hull of the 114,500 tonne vessel earlier this week.

Tug boats attached cables to the ship then started shifting it away from the shore.

Authorities then expressed satisfaction that the operation to float the Concordia had proceeded without a hitch.

Salvage operators said it would be towed by a Dutch vessel and a Vanuatu-flagged one at a speed of two knots an hour to reach the port of Genoa in around four days.

Civil protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli, who is heading up the salvage said: 'We have decided it would be preferable to begin the operation on Tuesday. We're entering the final phase.'

Since the disaster the Costa Concordia has remained stricked on the island of Giglio and the island's mayor Sergio Ortelli is hopeful the latest operation will be a success.

He added: 'This is the moment all our citizens, Italians and the world have been waiting for. Let's cross our fingers and try to overcome this difficult moment.'
