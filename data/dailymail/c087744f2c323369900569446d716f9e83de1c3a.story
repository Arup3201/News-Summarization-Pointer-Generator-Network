Andrew Mitchell was yesterday eager to prove he had put his problems with the police behind him – by planting a kiss on the cheek of a female officer.

Mr Mitchell made the awkward gesture to Chief Superintendent Lorraine Bottomley after visiting a police station in his constituency.

He said he had been visiting the local police and other emergency services for the past 11 years to thank them for keeping the community safe ‘while many of us are putting our feet up over Christmas’.

Tory MP Andrew Mitchell today put his stand-off with police to one side to embrace Chief Superintendent Lorraine Bottomley on the steps of Sutton Coldfield police station

‘They’ve done such a very good job,’ 
he added. ‘They’ve made Sutton Coldfield the second safest town in 
Britain and I’m very proud of what the police have achieved.’

Despite the recent furore over the 
‘plebgate’ affair, Mr Mitchell insisted he had always had ‘a really 
excellent relationship’ with his local police.

He added: ‘We’ve worked closely together for the past 11 years in the interest of the local community.

‘They’re a great team, they do a very good job and we work together extremely well.’

Meanwhile, the leader of the rank and 
file police last night said he would apologise to Mr Mitchell if an 
investigation found the MP did not call officers ‘plebs’ during the 
infamous incident in Downing Street.

Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police 
Federation, said he ‘will be one of the first in the queue to apologise’
if the former Chief Whip is exonerated.

It was a very public display of support for the police at a time when senior Tories have claimed Mr Mitchell is the victim of a 'stitch up'

Mr Mitchell had been holding meetings with members of the police force in his Sutton Coldfield constituency

Mr Mitchell has claimed the plebgate saga has 'shaken' his confidence in the police

After details of Mr Mitchell’s 
foul-mouthed rant were leaked, members of the federation repeatedly 
referred to the scandal in their campaign to highlight alleged police 
cuts, wearing ‘PC Pleb’ T-shirts to the Tory party conference to try to 
garner public sympathy.

Yesterday Mr McKeever admitted he 
‘came pretty close’ to demanding the minister’s head in the days after 
the row blew up and acknowledged concerns that his organisation had 
‘stoked up’ media attention.

Mr McKeever said he was ‘taken aback 
and shocked’ by Mr Mitchell’s reported comments, which came immediately 
after the murder of two women police officers in Manchester.

‘I think we can all say we could have done things better,’ he told Radio 4’s PM programme.

The Met Police now have 30 officers 
working on the investigation into plebgate, which has been widened to 
probe claims of a conspiracy against Andrew Mitchell. The Metropolitan 
Police Service Directorate of Professional Standards inquiry wants to:

‘The federation has to look at how we 
can get some measure of control to ensure that there is perhaps a better
way of doing business in the future.

‘If he has been done a calumny in relation to what happened, I will be one of the first in the queue to apologise.

‘I can understand when people say 
there is a danger that trust might be eroded in the British police 
service as a result of what’s happened.’

His comments came as Scotland 
Yard revealed that a second man had been arrested in connection with the
affair.

A 23-year-old man was questioned 
yesterday on suspicion of helping a police officer from the elite 
Diplomatic Protection Group commit misconduct in a public office.

Speculation was growing last night 
that the latest suspect, who is not a police officer, may have attempted
to conceal evidence last Friday.

The alleged offence took place the day
before the 52-year-old police officer from the DPG was arrested in 
North London last Saturday on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

The officer is accused of sending a 
fabricated email claiming he had witnessed Mr Mitchell call officers 
‘f***ing plebs’ at the gates of Downing Street on September 19.

It has since emerged that key sections
of the barely literate email, which he sent to his local MP John 
Randall, directly contradict CCTV footage from Downing Street of the 
incident.

His alleged accomplice was arrested at a house in North London on Wednesday evening.

Controversy: Andrew Mitchell with his wife yesterday

Scotland Yard said the man’s home was 
searched and he was released on police bail yesterday but would not 
confirm if he is related to the officer who was arrested.

Some 30 officers are working on the inquiry, which is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron today expressed his dismay at the allegation that a police officer tried to 'blacken the name' of a Cabinet minister'

Detectives are also investigating how 
the police log, with details of the police officers’ version of events, 
was leaked to the media.

MPs and journalists are expected to be interviewed as part of the leak enquiry.

Met Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said it is ‘vital’ police solve the affair.

Former home secretary Kenneth Baker told BBC2's Daily Politics that the police 'must be above politics in our country'.

Mr Mitchell used freedom of information laws to obtain a copy of CCTV footage which he says contradicts the official police report of the incident

Mr Mitchell left his London home this morning amid calls from some Tory MPs for him to be reinstated in the government

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
