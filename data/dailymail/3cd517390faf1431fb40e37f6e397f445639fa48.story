She is the wife of a former Archbishop and a noted theologian who has written about the role of women in the male-dominated Church.

Yet when asked to name her favourite female biblical character, Jane Williams drew a blank – and plumped for St Paul instead.

Her decision to overlook all of the 188 women named in the scriptures is especially ironic given that she was asked the question for a new book about prejudice in the Christian establishment.

‘I am afraid I have to say my favourite biblical figure is a man and I don’t have a favourite woman,’ said the lecturer, who is married to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.

Instead she chose St Paul, saying: ‘I just think Paul is one of the great maligned and misunderstood figures in the Bible.

‘But I think that he’s such a complex and interesting person and responsible for so much of how we see theology.’

Dr Williams is one of 12 prominent female Christians who were interviewed for Women In Waiting, a new book by Julia Ogilvy, subtitled Prejudice At The Heart Of The Church.

Mrs Ogilvy – daughter-in-law of the Queen’s cousin Princess Alexandra – even cites the patriarchal writings of St Paul as one reason why women’s progress has been hampered.

Nonetheless, 57-year-old Dr Williams – who wrote her own book, Bread, Wine And Women, about female ordination – praised her hero’s ‘complete passion’ and the fact he ‘changed his life’ after his conversion when he had a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus.

The mother of two, a lecturer at  St Paul’s Theological Centre in London, added: ‘He is an intellectual person who’s going to do such rigorous theology but it was the encounter with Jesus that took him there.’

None of Dr Williams’s fellow contributors have had any difficulty naming their heroines, with one even opting for the bleeding woman who touches Jesus in Luke 8, 40-48.

Baroness Helena Kennedy, the Catholic QC, is one of two contributors to pick Mary Magdalene, the second most important woman in  the New Testament after The Virgin Mary.

Although traditionally portrayed as a fallen woman saved from a life of sin by Christ, she is now believed to have been a teacher and a leader in her own right.

Rev Tamsin Merchant, a vicar in North London, chooses Deborah, the Old Testament prophet and warrior who inspired troops into battle.

In her contribution, Dr Williams is careful not to rock the boat on the role of women in the Church. 

She wrote: ‘I partly agree with  the problem of the Church’s patriarchal image but the other side is  that there are quite a lot of women in fairly senior positions in the Church of England.’
