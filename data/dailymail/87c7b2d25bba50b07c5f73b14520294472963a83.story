A football referee has been banned for life after allegedly headbutting another official after a youth match.

Julian Workman, 43, was coaching an under 11s side at  Redditch United’s Valley Stadium when he was accused of assaulting the referee.

He was originally fined 'for misconduct' by Birmingham County FA after the incident which took place on the car park at the non-league club.

But now the regional FA’s Referee Disciplinary Panel has imposed a lifetime refereeing ban.

A Birmingham County FA spokesman said: 'The referee committee have imposed a ban on him refereeing and that is subject to an appeal.

'He didn’t have a personal hearing so he now has the opportunity to come along and puts his side forward.'

Mr Workman had been promoted to a Level 6 official in April last year - meaning he was able to referee county level matches.

He also works as a junior and senior football development officer at Redditch United FC. 

It comes days after a junior footballer was banned for seven years by FA bosses after allegedly wiping spit on a referee's back.

Jake Schofield, 15, reportedly spat on his hand and smeared it on the official at the end of a game between his side Moston Valley and Failsworth West Juniors in Manchester.

He was reported to Manchester FA and was stunned to later find out he had been banned from playing football until August 2021.

Redditch United Chairman Chris Swan added: 'The first I became aware of this ruling was on Wednesday (July 9) as I was leaving the country. I intend to discuss it fully with Mr Workman on my return.

'It should also be stated that he protests his innocence and that he will be appealing.

'The club does not condone aggressive behaviour or any deviation from the high standards it sets for all it’s officers, on or off the field, at any level.'

One parent is now calling for the Southern League side to take disciplinary action against Mr Workman, who is also the club’s Junior Secretary.

The father-of-one, who did not want to be named, said: 'I hope that the club takes appropriate action

Redditch United Chairman Chris Swan said that Mr Workman insisted that he was innocent

'He oversees all of the youth teams and is supposed to set a positive example to the youngsters.

'It’s ridiculous that you can be banned from refereeing, but can continue to hold official positions at the football club.

'If somebody like Luis Suarez can get banned from all football related activities for violent conduct, how can somebody who has been banned from refereeing be allowed to stay involved with the club?

'Being a referee himself you would think he would have respect for officials and what a tough job they have.

'If he has been banned by the local FA then surely he isn’t a good role model for the club’s youngsters who are trying to make their way in the game.'
