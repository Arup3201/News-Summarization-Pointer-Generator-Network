Surveillance video has captured the moment a natural gas leak caused an explosion that almost leveled a Massachusetts auto supply shop.

The entire left side of Victory Auto Supply in Fitchburg collapsed and debris was scattered everywhere at around 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

According to fire officials, the blast occurred when natural gas leaked from a pipeline on the street, traveled underground and met with an ignition source in the shop.

The store's owner, John Tate, was inside with a customer when it happened but luckily escaped with only minor injuries.

'(I'm) just lucky to be standing here talking to you people I guess,' he told Fox News.

'It was just unexpected because we were just standing there talking and all of a sudden that's when we heard the big boom and stuff started falling down. We high-tailed it to the front door and luckily got out in time.'

He said his wife usually worked in the section of the building that was destroyed but didn't come in that day.

'That whole section that's torn down was the office,' he told Fox. 'Luckily my wife didn't show up like she normally does or she would have been up in the office.'

No one was severely hurt in the explosion but 10 people were displaced and the Red Cross found them hotels for the night.

Seven buildings in total suffered some structural damage, including cracked walls in the auto body shop across the street that filmed the blast on its security camera.

Witnesses told Fox News they could feel the explosion from miles away. One man living near the shop said his power went out.

Tate, who has owned Victory Auto Supply for 17 years, is already scoping for new premises, assuming the building is too damaged to repair.
