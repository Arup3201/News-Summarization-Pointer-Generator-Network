Police have found a tuft of blonde hair just a mile away from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered, it emerged on Monday.

Someone walking in a field made the discovery at the weekend and comes just days after police found a wooden cross which they believe may be a vital piece of evidence in the case. 

The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found  on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school.

A local news channel reported that the source alerted police to the scene and a grid search was conducted while the hair was taken into evidence.

A clue? A tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered prompting local station Fox 31 to link the evidence to the case

But Westminster police investigating her
murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case.

After Denver's Fox 31 news team made the 
so-called potential evidence public in an 'exclusive' report yesterday, investigator Trevor Materasso ruled '60 percent' of the new station's reporting
'erroneous and bad information.'

Misleading: An investigator on the case called Fox 31's reporting 'erroneous' and said that the police still do not even know if the hair was human let alone Jessica's

He told the Denver Post that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with Jessica or is even human.

'We don't even know if this is dog hair yet,' he said. 'Like everything else, every tip we've gotten, it was taken and we'll take a look at it to see if it's connected.'

The most recent clue in the tragic investigation that police are examining carefully, appeared in the form of a wooden cross last week.

Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday.

'Authorities are looking for someone who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department Mr Materasso said in a statement.

Police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses.

The solid wood pendant has three vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side.

'The cross appears to be a solid piece of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below the short horizontal section,' Mr Materasso said.

He added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.'

Last Thursday, police revealed that they suspect Jessica's killer may have attempted to abduct a woman in the same area months earlier.

In the previous abduction attempt, a 22-year-old woman jogging around a lake about a half-mile from the Ridgeway home was grabbed from behind by a man who placed a rag with a chemical odor to it over her mouth.

The woman escaped and described her attacker as a light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair.

'Police believe there may be a connection between the Jessica Ridgeway murder and the attempted abduction at Ketner Lake, and urge the public to specifically look for someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect's description from Ketner Lake,' Mr Materasso said.

'In an ongoing attempt to identify the predator responsible for (Jessica's) abduction and murder, police are asking the public to look at several pictures to see if these will help lead police to the killer.'

Jessica was last seen beginning a short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of Oct. 5. She never arrived.

Widespread hunt: An extensive search was carried out in the days after Jessica first disappeared on October 5

A search by hundreds of law officers did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't there.

Fliers about the fifth-grader were posted on nearly every house in Jessica's neighborhood of modest, two-story homes with single-car garages.

Purple ribbons, Jessica's favorite color and a symbol of hope for her return, were tied around trees.

Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home.

At about 5pm on Wednesday, dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working on a credible tip.

Grim find: Jessica's dismembered body was found behind a cabin

After the body was found, police covered it in a sheet and used the flood lights from a firetruck to illuminate the crime scene so they could work late into the night.

The focus of their search was an abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes.

Several new housing developments are close to the park and a busy highway runs alongside it.

Police said they are not suspicious that Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle over her, had any involvement in the disappearance.

'At this point in the investigation, after thoroughly looking at the parents, we're confident they're not involved in the disappearance of Jessica Ridgeway,' Materasso said on Wednesday afternoon. 'The focus shifts to [an] unknown suspect.'

The girl's mother Sarah Ridgeway and Jeremiah Bryant, the girl's father, spoke out on Tuesday, denying any involvement in her disappearance.

'I know I didn't do anything. Everybody that's here knows I didn't do anything,' said Jessica Ridgeway's mother, Sarah, surrounded by relatives dressed in purple - her daughter's favorite color.

She added, 'Nobody in this room did anything to harm her or a tiny hair on her little head.'

Sarah Ridgeway was joined by ten family members, among them her ex-husband, Jeremiah Bryant, who said that when questioned by the FBI if his former spouse could have anything to do with the 10-year-old's disappearance, he said 'no.'

'I don't see how any parent could do something like that to their child,' Bryant added, according to Fox31.

Appearing composed for most of the 38-minute-long pubic statement, the girl's mother told a reporter that she understands that police need to conduct an investigation before they eliminate her from the list of potential suspects.

'I know it's something that has to get done,' she said. 'The have to get it out of there.'

Police announced that the 'not intact' body had been identified as Jessica's on October 12 and have been warning parents to be vigilant - reminding them a predator is still on the loose.

'Our focus has changed from the search for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica,' said Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk. 'We realise there is a predator at large in our community.'

Anxious parents in Denver kept close watch over their children and the FBI again urged residents to report any suspicious activity by people they know.

'We want you to look for changes of habits, patterns, peculiar absences of those around you and report it to law enforcement,' said Jim Yacone, FBI special agent in charge in Denver.

Grieving: Family and friends share their grief during Jessica's memorial service

The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration officials and state Department of Corrections were reviewing registered sex offenders in the area, Yacone said without elaborating.

Investigators have received more than 1,500 tips from the public. Authorities also have searched more than 500 homes and more than 1,000 vehicles but still need the public's help, Yacone said.

Last Saturday, one day after the heartbreaking discovery, her family and friends came together to pay tribute to the dead 10-year-old, launching balloons into the sky above her Colorado home.

Jessica's favourite colour of purple was donned by thousands of memorial-goers who released purple-and-green message-strewn balloons at a park in Westminster on Saturday evening.
