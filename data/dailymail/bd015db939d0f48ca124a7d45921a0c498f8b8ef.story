A brewery has told its pub landlords they should limit drinkers to just one-and-a-half pints a night, and that they should keep a calculator to hand to help them count that far.

Bedford-based brewer Charles Wells has 
warned tenants that customers should not drink more than the Government 
guideline of three to four alcohol units a day.

And the company sent out 'Drinkaware' leaflet 
telling bar staff to 'grab a calculator' and 
work out when people have reached the limit.

Drink aware: Bedford-based brewer Charles Wells sent a leaflet to publicans advising them that drinkers should be limited to three to four alcohol units a day - meaning they should not drink more than one-and-a-half pints of flagship beer Bombardier, advertised by Rik Mayall

A Charles Wells leaflet describing how many units are in some of their products in comparison to the number of units consumers should not regularly exceed

The leaflet also spells out that 
Bombardier - Wells' flagship beer, which is advertised by comedian Rik 
Mayall - contains 2.7 units a pint while strong Erdinger lager contains 
three.

This means that a pint and half of either brand would push a drinker over the recommended daily level.

Publicans at some of the brewer's 200 pubs have said they will not follow the new guidelines.

'It's absolutely crazy,' said one publican, who runs a pub in Bedfordshire but does not wish to be named for fear of suffering repercussions from the brewery.

'If I followed their recommendations and limited people to just one pint, I'd soon lose all my customers.

'Takings would slump and the pub would go bust within a month.'

The Wells leaflet is headed: 'Help your customers be Drinkaware'.

The leaflet also suggests drinkers 'grab a calculator' to work out how many units they are drinking

Limit: According to the guidelines - originally issued by the Royal College of Physicians in 1987 - women should not exceed more than two or three units per day, equivalent to around one standard glass of red wine

It goes on to say: 'As a responsible alcohol retailer, you'll want to make sure you can offer help and advice to your customers so they can make an informed decision as to what they should or shouldn't drink to stay within the recommended daily guidelines.

'There's vast amount of information and material to call upon, but we thought it would be helpful to have a reference sheet.'

According to DrinkAware, women should not regularly exceed 2-3 units per day and men 3-4.

The number of units in alcohol, according to NHS Choices is as follows -

1 alcopop (275ml 4% ABV)  - 1.1 units

1 pint ale (568ml 4% ABV) - 2.3 units

1 pint low-strength lager(568ml ABV 3.6%) - 2 units

1 small glass of wine (any variety)(125ml 12% ABV) - 1.5 units

1 standard glass of wine (any variety) (175ml 12% ABV) - 2.1 units

1 large glass of wine (any variety)250ml 12% ABV) - 3 units

Single shot of Gin, rum, vodka, whisky, tequila, sambuca(25ml 40% ABV) - 1 unit

The leaflet spells out that one alcohol unit is equivalent to half a standard glass of red wine, a single measure of whisky or a third of a pint of beer.

According to the guidelines - originally issued by the Royal College of Physicians in 1987 - women should not exceed more than two or three units per day, while men should limit themselves to four.

The brewery leaflet adds: 'To work out the units for any particular drink, grab a calculator and use this sum: Strength (ABC) x Volume (ml) divided by 1,000 = Number of units.'

The publican said: 'What nonsense. As if on a busy Friday or Saturday night, I've got the time to grab a ruddy calculator and do some complicated sums before I serve anybody a drink.

'I'm seething about this. It's political correctness and health and safety gone absolutely berserk.'

A Charles Wells spokesman said: 'We have signed up to the Department of Health's Public Health Responsibility Deal and pledged to provide licensees with simple and consistent information to raise awareness of the unit content of alcoholic drinks and the national drinking guidelines.

'The leaflet we produced was designed to amalgamate information about the Government's recommended daily allowance for alcohol consumption, how units are calculated and the units per pint in each of our beers into a helpful reference sheet for our licensees and their staff to advise customers appropriately so they can make an informed decision.'
