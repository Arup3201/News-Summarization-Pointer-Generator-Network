The largest bird that ever flew, which had a staggering 24ft (7 metre) wingspan, was so heavy it would have had to take off like a hang glider.

Computer simulations have revealed that the prehistoric condor-like Pelagornis sandersi could only have left the ground by taking a running jump downhill into a headwind.

But once airborne, it would have been a highly efficient flyer, despite its extraordinary wingspan being more than twice that of the albatross - the world’s largest flying bird today.

This graphic shows how the enormous 'condor', which lived 28 million years ago, compares to modern-day birds, including the albatross, eagle, vulture, gull and sparrow. The Pelagornis sandersi is a species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks

Working from a fossil skull, as well as wing and leg bones, researchers calculated the likely size of the bird, and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding.

The fossil of the prehistoric flyer was unearthed in 1983, in 
South Carolina.

It was found when construction workers began digging a new terminal at
 the Charleston International Airport, and was so big they had to remove it using a JCB.

Working from a fossil skull, as well as

and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding.

Even though it would have weighed up to 180lbs (81.5kg), the researchers said they have no doubt P sandersi flew.

Its
 paper-thin hollow bones, stumpy legs and wing shape made it similar to 
birds that fly today, and this would have made it awkward when on land.

Its size and telltale beak suggested the creature was a previously unknown 
species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed 
to be ancestors of pelicans and storks.

They
 were known for bony ‘teeth’ that lined their jaws.

These giants of the sky occurred all 
over the globe for tens of millions of years but vanished during the 
Pliocene - just three million years ago.

Its paper-thin hollow bones, stumpy legs and wing shape made it similar to birds that fly today, and this would have made it awkward when on land.

But, because it exceeded the 15ft (4.5 metre) wingspan previous studies have claimed is the maximum for birds to fly, the researchers were unsure how it managed to take off and stay aloft.

The fossil was unearthed in 1983 in South Carolina when construction workers began digging a new terminal at the Charleston International Airport. It was so big they had to remove it using a JCB.

Dr Dan Ksepka, curator of science at Bruce Museum in Connecticut, said: 'The upper wing bone alone was longer than my arm.'

Its sheer size and telltale beak suggested the creature was a previously unknown species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks.

They were known for bony ‘teeth’ that lined their jaws, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Named in 
honour of dig leader Dr Albert Sanders - retired curator of Charleston 
Museum where the fossil’s housed - the bird lived 25 to 28 million years
 ago, after the dinosaurs died out, but long before the first humans 
arrived in the area.

Once airborne, computer simulations suggest the bird’s long, slender wings made it an expert glider.

P. sandersi breaks the record held by the previously known biggest flyer Argentavis magnificens - a condor-like bird that lived in the Andes mountains six million years ago. It had a wingspan of 21ft (6.4 metres). The average albatross (pictured), which is the largest flying bird today, has a wingspan of 9.8ft (3 metres)

It would have occasionally swooped down to the water to feed on soft-bodied prey like squid and eels.

The skeleton was very well preserved - a rarity because of the paper-thin nature of the bones in these birds.

Dr Ksepka said: 'Pelagornithids were like creatures out of a fantasy novel - there is simply nothing like them around today.'

These giants of the sky occurred all over the globe for tens of millions of years but vanished during the Pliocene - just three million years ago. Paleontologists remain uncertain about the cause of their demise.

P. sandersi breaks the record held by the previously known biggest flyer Argentavis magnificens - a condor-like bird that lived in the Andes mountains, and the pampas of Argentina, six million years ago.

It had a wing-span of 21ft (6.4 metres), and a computer simulation carried out seven years ago suggested it flew in a similar style.
