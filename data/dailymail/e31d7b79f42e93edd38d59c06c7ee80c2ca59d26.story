They came in their hundreds of thousands to dance and have a good time, Rio de Janeiro-style.

And yesterday revellers let their hair down in style at the Notting Hill Carnival in West London, with drumming groups, floats and sound systems all taking centre stage.

More than 6,500 police officers patrolled the streets for the second day of the event yesterday as Scotland Yard continued its unprecedented security operation just weeks after the riots.

Record numbers of police officers were on duty, with London's reputation at stake in the wake of widespread violence and looting earlier this month.

The festivities got off to a peaceful start on Sunday, with more than 5,500 officers on the streets, as revellers descended on the capital for Europe's biggest street festival.

By yesterday morning police had made 88 arrests for a variety of offences, including drugs possession, public order, theft, criminal damage, robbery and assault, the Metropolitan Police said.

Last night police confirmed that an additional 126 arrests had been made during the course of yesterday, bringing the total number of arrests made during the two-day party to 214. That compares favourably
 to last year when 243 people were arrested.

Police chiefs targeted troublemakers by making more than 40 pre-emptive arrests last week and agreeing an earlier finish time of 7pm for both days.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said Notting Hill's streets emptied quickly after 7pm last night, adding that a visible police presence would remain until the early hours of this morning to disperse any groups that are gathered.

He said: 'So far the event has been very peaceful, there have been a small number of isolated incidents that police responded to and resolved quickly. We believe the early finish has had a positive effect on how the event has gone so far.'

Almost 600 revellers needed medical treatment over the two days and 59 of those were hospitalised, police said.

Officers from the dog support unit 
also seized three Pit-Bull type dogs under Section 1 of the Dangerous 
Dogs Act but no-one was arrested, the force added.

Commander Steve Rodhouse had earlier announced there would be a larger 
police operation in place during yesterday's celebrations, with the 5,500 officers 
on duty on Sunday increased to 6,500.

Commander Rodhouse said: 
'Traditionally, Sunday is children's day, thousands of people came out 
in Notting Hill to take part in this vibrant event which is so important
 in the capital's calendar.

'Through effective stop-and-search, we believe we have deterred and prevented trouble from taking place.

'We've
 worked closely with event stewards and have seen huge support from all 
carnival participants to meet that really important earlier closedown.

'Our intelligence picture has not 
changed and we will make sure that our officers are out stopping the 
right people so everyone else can take part and join in the fun.'

Police
 have put in place a Section 60 order, which allows them to search 
individuals to prevent serious violence, and a Section 60 AA order, 
giving officers the power to require any person to remove items that 
conceal their identity.

Elsewhere
 in London there were more than 4,000 additional officers 'as well as 
the thousands who are normally on duty', Mr Rodhouse said.

Mr Rodhouse previously said troublemakers were plotting disruption via social networking technology.

He said the 'degree of chatter' surrounding troublemakers was consistent with previous years - despite thousands of arrests after the wave of looting and violence that gripped England a few weeks ago.

London Mayor Boris Johnson issued a rallying call before the festivities began to 'let the true spirit of London shine through', hoping the carnival will help heal wounds left by the riots.

'It's right that the carnival goes ahead so we can show the world that the overwhelming majority of London's people are decent, law-abiding citizens who respect the law, love their city and want to celebrate our vibrant, diverse and historical culture,' he said.

The Mayor will be visiting the carnival this afternoon.

Carnival-goers have so far enjoyed clearer skies today than they did yesterday.

Victoria
 Kettley, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: 'It has been a fine start and 
should remain dry. Temperatures will be about 18 degrees.'

After
 downpours the previous day, the weather yesterday was mainly kind to 
revellers and remained mild, although showers passed through Notting 
Hill for half an hour.
