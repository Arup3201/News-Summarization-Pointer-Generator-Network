Peter admitted he used to play Doctor Who as a child growing up in Glasgow, and was thrilled he was able to play it as an adult.

He enthused: 'I'm a lifelong Doctor Who fan. I haven't played it since I was nine. As an adult actor I've never worked on it.

During his interview, it was revealed that as a teenager, Peter had written to the Radio Times to congratulate the BBC on their Dr Who special.

Speaking about the casting of Peter, executive producer and head writer Stephen Moffat  
said: 'We got the 12th person around and made a home video of him being 
the Doctor and showed it to the relevant people, and everyone said "Yes, 
that's the Doctor."'

 to play the best part on television. Peter Capaldi is in the TARDIS!'

 on his time as The Doctor, Matt said: 'I'll miss playing a character 
who can bounce from A-Z and be the smartest in the room and the silliest
 in the room... what a character!

'Of course there's a part of me that doesn't want to go. There are no parts like this.'

Speaking about his successor, Matt 
remarked: 'I just want to wish my successor all the best and just say 
good luck and good on you for getting it.

genius and versatility needed to take on the mantel of the great Time 
Lord and make the role his own.

'He'll bring his own particular wisdom, charisma and wit to the Twelfth Doctor and take the show into an exciting new era.'

Ben
 Stephenson, Controller, BBC Drama Commissioning added: 'We started 
thinking Peter Capaldi might be the right person to take on this iconic 
part a few months ago. But it was only when he did a secret audition at 
Steven's house under the cover of darkness that we knew we had our man.

'He's
 an extraordinarily talented actor who can seemingly turn his hand to 
anything. We can't wait to premiere his unique take on the Doctor on 
Christmas Day and we are sure he's going to become one of the all-time 
classic Doctors.'
