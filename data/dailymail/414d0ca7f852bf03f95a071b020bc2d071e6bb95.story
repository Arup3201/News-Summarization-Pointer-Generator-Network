The NatWest Twenty20 Blast has lift-off on Friday as the renamed and revamped competition starts across the country.

Fourteen of the 18 counties begin their 2014 T20 campaigns and to celebrate the start of this year's version, the ECB have launched a cricket ball into space from Edgbaston.

There will, of course, be plenty of batsmen looking to do the same, including Kevin Pietersen, Aaron Finch and Jos Buttler, and the runs are set to flow this summer.

Out of the park: The ball sailing over Edgbaston after being launched into space

Out of this world: The ball hovers over the planet - even KP of Finch would struggle to hit it that far!

Durham v Worcestershire (5.30pm)

Gloucestershire v Somerset (5.30) 

Leicestershire v Derbyshire (5.30)    

Yorkshire v Northants (5.30)   

Notts v Lancashire (6.30)   

Hampshire v Glamorgan (7.0)   

Sussex v Surrey (7.0)   

Saturday

Middlesex v Essex (noon)   

Middlesex v Sussex Lord's (4.0pm)   

Lancashire v Worcestershire (7.0)

There could be another big-hitting, fast-bowling addition as Andrew Flintoff looks set to rejoin Lancashire for the competition - if he can prove his fitness in the seconds.

Most of this year's matches will take place on Friday nights in an attempt to maximise attendances and there will be musical accompaniment following the ECB's quest to find supporters' favourite songs.

The players certainly seem to be looking forward to the competition starting, with many of them going on Twitter to express their excitement. Lancashire's Tom Smith, involved in the first live TV match of the tournament at Notts, possibly put it best with the succinct message: 'T20 is here let the slogging start!'

The pinnacle of the Twenty20 season is, of course, Finals day and this year it is at Edgbaston on August 23. Northants are the holders after their victory over Surrey last year.

The race to topple them starts on Friday. Players and fans will have a blast.

They're going to have a blast: Representatives from each of the 18 counties with the trophy
