 A fugitive who escaped from an Idaho jail in August is now taunting cops from the beautiful beaches of Cancun, Mexico, authorities believe. 

Nick Grove, who was doing time for burglary and firearms possession, hopped the razor wire-topped fence at the Payette County Jail on August 26 and fled. 

The 27-year-old surfaced on social media about a month later - posing frequent updates on Facebook and even chatting with a local TV reporter.

Wish you weren't here: Nick Grove, who escaped from jail in Idaho in August, is now posting photos like these publicly on his Facebook profile - taunting cops

Grove openly declares that he is in Cancun, Mexico, on his Facebook profile and posts pictures such as this one showing his location

At the time, he used software to mask his location online and where he was logging in from.

Now, he's revealed his new digs - and he's rubbing it in cops faces.

The Ontario, Oregon, native's Facebook page reveals that he lives in Cancun. 

 He has posted numerous photos of himself relaxing on the beach.

One shows him shirtless, toes on the sand, defiantly waving his middle finger at the camera.

He has also posted several intimate pictures with women - proving that he's enjoying his time as a free man.  

But authorities back in Idaho have said Grove shouldn't be too smug - they haven't given up trying to throw him back behind bars.

Gove hopped the razor-wire-topped fence at the jail and darted to freedom in August. He has not been seen since

They have contacted Facebook to attempted to track down his location and have also alerted the US Marshals service and local authorities in Cancun, Mexico. 

 Authorities said they believe Grove's family are helping him to settle in Mexico.

KTVB reported in September, one month after Grove's escape, that he had already forged a new life and a new identity - and even got a job and was working again. 

'This is my element. Within four days I had a new life, new ID, new face, new job,' he told the TV station.
