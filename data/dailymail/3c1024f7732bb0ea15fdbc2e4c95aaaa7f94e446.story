 A 14-year-old girl noticed something fishy when opening a Christmas present she thought was the Beats By Dre Headphones she had on her 'wish list'. Wrapped inside the packaging was not headphones, rather it was cans of Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light tuna.

Carmen Lopez, 14, of Bothell, Washington tried returning her disappointing gift to Walmart in exchange for actual headphones but Walmart only offered to give her a refund.

The refund wouldn't even be equal to the retail price of the headphones since they were purchased on Black Friday on sale, reported Yahoo News.

Out of tuna: these cans of tuna most certainly don't play any music

Carmen Lopez tried to get Walmart to exchange the tuna for headphones but they only gave her a refund not equal to the retail price of the headphones

'WalMart had said they would only give us a refund, at least the store did which didn’t sound right, because I just really want my headphones at this point. Because I was really looking forward to them, ' Carmen told KCPQ Q13 Fox News.

Carmen's father Steve told Fox that he ordered the headphones online during a mega Black Friday sale at Walmart.

'This is what I picked up here and it was wrapped in plastic. So I thought they were legit,' her father told Fox.

To add to the irony of the situation, Carmen's little sister is allergic to tuna fish, reported The Examiner.

Even though Walmart didn't give Carmen her headphones, the gobal account manager of sales for Beats by Dre did.

'Last night my father and I were watching the news and saw the unfortunate gift fiasco,' Lindsay Merkle said.

'So we said, ‘OK, let’s solve this problem today.’

Lindsay decided to make it up to Carmen by giving her a pair of headphones for free.

'I can only imagine what was going through [Carmen's] head,' Merkle said. 'So hopefully this will help her be a little bit happier and get something that she was actually looking forward to on Christmas.'

The Mail Online tried contacting Walmart who was not available for comment.

The Examiner speculates that a Walmart employee may have stolen the headphones and replaced them with something of equal weight--definitely not value.

There is nowhere on the headphone's packaging that would suggest a relationship to tuna fish
