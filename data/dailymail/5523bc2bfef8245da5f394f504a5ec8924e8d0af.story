At the time of the incident one witness told Click Orlando: 'There's a lot of people down there. He's got a gun, there's a lot of blood on the ground, a lot'.

Another witness told the television channel that Noble 'had the gun to his side and actually a really large knife attached to his belt'.

Witnesses alleged that Noble had been drinking at the bar earlier in the evening but was asked to leave.

Mr Mironov described his actions as 'a split-second reaction'.

Both men, who allegedly tried to stop Noble from using his weapons, were left injured.
