Ministers were accused of putting the profits of internet giants ahead of the safety of children yesterday in the row over online porn.

Child safety campaigners said the Coalition’s decision to veto an automatic block – despite clear evidence that parents support the idea – had left them ‘back at square one’.

Rather than forcing users to ‘opt in’ for pornography, internet service providers will merely be asked to ‘actively encourage’ parents to switch on filters if children are likely to be using computers in the home.

Vulnerable: Ministers were accused of backing down from an automatic ban on online pornography to stop children being exposed to it. Picture posed by model

The decision came despite more than 40 per cent of parents responding to the Government’s own consultation saying they knew their children had accessed online porn.

Children’s charities, backed by the Daily Mail, have led a concerted campaign for an automatic block on online porn but their views have also been ignored.

A Downing Street source last night claimed the package amounted to ‘the most rigorous system for protecting children from online dangers in the world’.

But Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman accused ministers of ‘broken promises’ over the issue, saying they had bowed to pressure from the internet industry, which is opposed to restrictions on the lucrative porn sector.

The Prime Minister has put vested interests – in this case ISPs – ahead of the views of parents and ahead of protecting our children,’ she said.

Claude Knights, director of children’s safeguarding charity Kidscape, said: ‘This really is disappointing.

‘We felt creating an opt-in requirement would have ensured greater safeguarding for children.

'Of course it would not have stopped everything but it would have definitely been a big step in the right direction.

‘Where do we stand now? Really we are back to square one. We have some children who are more at risk than others.’

The Government’s response to a high-profile consultation on protecting children from online dangers was slipped out on the Department for Education’s website last Friday without fanfare.

The NSPCC and others campaigned to force those wishing to view adult sites into a new ‘opt in’ system that would require contacting their ISP.

The proposal was bitterly opposed by the powerful internet industry.

Some 35 per cent of parents responding to the consultation backed the ‘opt-in’ system, with a further 15 per cent wanting it imposed with additional controls.

John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said mobile phone companies have been automatically blocking adult websites for nearly a decade and there was no reason ISPs could not do the same.

‘What the Government has proposed is a step forward, we recognise that, but we are disappointed they did not go further,’  he said.

Miranda Suit, co-founder of the Safermedia charity, which campaigns for a family-friendly internet, said access to internet pornography had reached ‘crisis point’.

‘This was a wasted opportunity,’ she said. ‘The Government has taken its eye off the ball and allowed itself to be misguided by industry figures and internet users who are not parents.

‘This consultation was meant to give parents a say and make protecting children a top priority. But instead others have been able to take priority.’ Tory MP Claire Perry, who helped lead the campaign for an opt-in system, said she was ‘disappointed’ with the Government’s response.

Mrs Perry, who handed in a petition to Downing Street on the issue containing more than 115,000 names, said she was pleased that the ISPs were going to be forced to do more, saying the campaign had produced a ‘sea change’ in their attitude towards the issue.

'But she added she was ‘obviously disappointed the opt-in option has been rejected’.

The Government is set to announce plans to have automatic prompts for parents reminding them to implement restrictions

The Education Department said no automatic block could filter out all harmful websites, adding that there was a danger it would breed a ‘false sense of security’ among parents. And it said a block would not deal with other online issues, such as cyber-bullying and internet grooming, which were best tackled by parents.

In its formal response the department said parents have ‘just as much responsibility for keeping their children safe when they are online as when they are offline, and the basic principles of harm are the same’.

Prime Minister David Cameron is said to be angry about the handling of the announcement on Friday, when no ministers were sent out to explain a package he believes will be more effective than an automatic block.

A Downing Street source last night said the ‘rigorous’ package would help parents to protect their children online.

Sophisticated filters will allow parents to choose the type of sites they want to restrict.

The source said: ‘Under this new system, where there are children in the house, there will be an automatic prompt for parents to tailor filters to suit their child’s needs.

‘Over the coming weeks and months we will continue to talk to the industry to ensure these proposals are implemented. We want to end up with nothing less than the most rigorous system for protecting children from online dangers in the world.’

Other measures include configuring new computers to automatically prompt parents to consider imposing controls to protect children.

ISPs will also be told to prompt existing customers to consider imposing restrictions.
