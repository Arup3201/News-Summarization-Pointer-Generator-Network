A man on trial in Canada for an alleged plot to derail a passenger train wanted to trigger a catastrophic natural disaster by blowing up Yellowstone Park, his trial heard.

Tunisian student Chiheb Esseghaier spoke of the 'death and destruction' an eruption of the massive supervolcano beneath the national park would cause in the US, the court heard.

'Wouldn't it be great if my enemies' worst national disaster could happen?' an undercover FBI agent reported Essaghaier, 30, as saying, according to the The Canadian Press.

Dastardly plan: An eruption from Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park. The park's geysers are heated by a massive reservoir of magma that the Canadian terror suspect allegedly plotted to blow up

Yellowstone Park, which straddles Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, sits atop a swelling reservoir of magma 55 miles across and 30 miles wide. In parts it reaches depths of nine miles.

It is this subterranean lake of molten rock that heats the park's famous geysers, but it has also been the cause of eruptions in the past that were so massive it has been dubbed a supervolcano.

Experts are divided on the impact an eruption of the supervolcano may have, but most say one would be catastrophic for the entire world.

In his third week of testimony, the undercover FBI agent said Essaghaier was 'very passionate' about the idea of triggering the Yellowstone volcano.

But in the end the doctoral student at the Université du Québec is said to have decided the idea was hopeless.

'No. We cannot do anything to make the volcano erupt. It's very deep. I don't have any access,' Essaghaier is alleged to have told the agent.

The court also heard that Essaghaier and his co-accused, Palestinian national Raed Jaser, considered a plot to poison soldiers and another to kill world leaders with a sniper rifle. 

Studies have suggested that previous eruptions of Yellowstone Park's supervolcano, which has lain dormant for 70,000 years, were a thousand times more powerful than the one in Mount St Helens in 1980.

When the super volcano last erupted about 640,000 years ago a cloud of ash covered the whole of North America and affected the global climate with an effect similar to a nuclear winter.

If it were to explode today, some say, the Yellowstone volcano would cover cities as far as 1,000 miles away with a layer of ash up to 10ft deep, killing all wildlife and making as much as two thirds of the U.S. uninhabitable.

However last year a study by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) poured cold water on the apocalyptic vision, concluding that such a scenario would not come to pass.

USGS said computer modelling suggested that cities up to 300 miles from the park would be covered by up to three feet of ash and cities further afield in the Midwest would be covered by a few inches.

Coastal cities such as New York and California would get only a fraction of an inch, USGS claimed.

However, the study did say that an eruption would shut down electronic communication and air travel throughout the country, as well as cause a year-long winter.

The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Pacific produced an ash cloud tens of miles across caused 'a year without a summer' across the globe with snowfall in the North Eastern United States in June.

Areas covered in feet of ash would see buildings at risk of collapse and sewer and water lines blocked, and winds would form large dunes of ash that would cover roads and buildings.

Farming in the Midwest would be devastated by the cloud of ash, and highways across the country would become slippy and treacherous.

There have been claims that a super-eruption will occur every 700,000 years at Yellowstone, making the next one imminent.

But critics say this prediction is based on only three known eruptions: 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago and 640,000 years ago.

The last volcanic activity at Yellowstone was a lava flow in its south about 70,000 years ago.

Jaser and Essaghaier deny the charges against them. The trial continues.
