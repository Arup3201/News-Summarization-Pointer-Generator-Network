It does not take Kevin Pietersen long to get the heavy roller out in his latest book, which is not so much an autobiography but his version of the often troubled episodes that marked his final years in international cricket.

You get the idea very early on, in the first few pages, as he recounts the meeting with Alastair Cook, Paul Downton and James Whitaker when he is informed that his England career is effectively over.

"The three wise men have decided that the disastrous Ashes tour was all my fault," he declares. It cannot, of course, be true that they believed it was all down to one man, and over the next three hundred pages we are invited to make our own minds up about whether he was treated fairly or not.

By the very end of KP: My Autobiography, he admits ‘there should have been more cricket in these pages’, and he would probably have helped his own cause if that were to be the case.

The theme of persecution runs through it like letters through a stick of Blackpool rock, as does the often very personal criticism of coach Andy Flower. There is too much of both, but it also leaves you to conclude that Pietersen has been sinned against as well as sinning.

The overall effect is to bestow a sense of melancholy as much as anything, for with a little more understanding of the human condition on both sides the most exciting England batsman of his generation might not be lost to the team, as he surely is now.

There is something faintly tragic when he almost pleads in the final chapter "I hope it might not truly be over" with reference to England. There is admirable self-awareness, and the tacit admission that being a Twenty20 freelance can never replace being a fully-fledged international, when he says in the preceding paragraph: "Any player who has been to the top mourns the excitement when it ends."

That helps make this book is a fascinating read, expertly and colourfully ghosted by journalist David Walsh, and it will have an appeal well beyond the boundaries of the cricket constituency.

When the smoke clears from all the vitriol and insults, there is much to glean for any follower of any sport. For instance the truism that success often only hides divisions in a dressing room, and that it is not necessarily the product of harmony behind the scenes. This effect is always exaggerated in cricket, which shoehorns players together for longer periods than any other pursuit.

You are also reminded that even glamorous and gifted superstars of sport are as needy and insecure as anyone else, often more so. They are traits which abound in Pietersen, although he is a complex man of many parts.

I got to know him relatively well in the early part of his England career as we used to collaborate on a column for Sportsmail together. Many of the things I recognised at the start of his journey are still recognisable throughout this book: he is someone of immense drive and ambition, likeable in many ways, intelligent and good company, polite and with some strong values. He could also, sometimes unwittingly, be quite rude and selfish.

You can understand him being upset by the attitude of what he terms the bowling clique of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann, who it is quite possible to imagine being a fairly malevolent force as a collective, if not as individuals. The business of the spoof Twitter account directed at him clearly wounds him more deeply than anyone would imagine, and exposes his more vulnerable side.

He also had to cope with what seems the general mistrust in our country, not just in cricket, of maverick exceptional talents. He could, unquestionably, have been handled better by the ECB and Andy Flower in particular.

Yet his brutal analysis of Flower – you may have read by now his description that 95 per cent of the time the coach was ‘f***ing horrendous’ – simply does not stand up to scrutiny. Flower’s methods could not have been so crude as clearly they worked for most of the time with outstanding results, and any fair-minded observer could hardly quarrel with what he and Andrew Strauss achieved.

Pietersen’s treatment of the coach, with whom the whole IPL question was evidently a constant bone of contention, is unnecessarily vicious. Some of the ridicule heaped on Matt Prior is plain amusing, some of it surely unwarranted. His condescension towards Alastair Cook as a captain, who he almost describes as some sort of Sergeant Wilson figure from Dad’s Army, is a case of damning with the faintest praise, but may ring more true.

Flower and Pietersen regularly clashed over the batsman's desire to play in the IPL

It is hard to disagree with Swann’s assessment on Monday that he has soft-pedalled on some figures in order not to jeopardise the possibility of a return one day.

One example of how Pietersen has managed to alienate people through his career is a particularly gratuitous swipe at the undeserving Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor, who he does not especially rate on account of his height. He refers to Taylor’s father being a jockey, and suggests the son might be more suited for that profession.

But ultimately you cannot argue that Pietersen deserves his say, he has clearly been misunderstood to a degree and, to his credit, he does acknowledge that he has made plenty of mistakes. He is not as bad as some would portray him, but not as pure as he would portray himself.

That is like so many autobiographies, but it would be wrong to paint this as any off-the-peg account of a sporting career. It is much better than that, and an essential read.
