 A madam-turned-candidate who ran against former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the city comptroller's race last year has been sentenced to two years in prison for selling prescription drugs illegally.

Federal Judge Edgardo Ramos sentenced a tearful, bleached blonde Kristin Davis after she apologized to the court on Wednesday.

The newly licensed cosmetologist asked for leniency. She said a prison sentence would cause her to lose her apartment and threaten her license.

Drug dealer and madame: Former Manhattan madam Kristin Davis arrives for her sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Manhattan where she was convicted of dealing prescription drugs 

Eliot Spitzer's madame: Kristin Davis has said she supplied hookers to former Governor Eliot Spitzer who is pictured here with his ex-wife Silda in 2008 

The judge noted that she committed a second crime almost as soon as she was off probation from her first offense.

The New York Daily News reports that the judge told her that she had both a caring family and professional success and had no reason other than greed to sell oxycodone, amphetamines, and muscle relaxers.

'The fact of the matter is you should not be standing here. You know better,” Judge Edgardo Ramos told Davis in Manhattan Federal Court.

'You involved yourself in this for no apparent reason but greed.'

Davis pleaded guilty in 2008 to promoting prostitution and spent four months in jail. The same year, Spitzer resigned as governor in an escort-service controversy.

Guilty: Kristen Davis, a one-time madam who ran against Elliott Spitzer in the New York City comptroller race last year, walks away from federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday after being sentenced 

She was arrested for selling prescription drugs to an FBI informant last year.

Davis told the judge that she was trying to straighten out her life by starting a career in cosmetology.

She said she only started dealing drugs after suffering for four months in Riker's Island where she served time for promoting prostitution.

'One hour inside of Rikers in solitary confinement was hell,' Davis said, tearing up.

'I came out of four months in solitary with a lot of issues.

She was also sentenced to two years supervised released and both mental health and drug treatment.

The judge made Davis give up $1,765 which is the value of the pills she sold from January to April of last year.

Davis has claimed that she was Eliot Spitzer's go to Madame when he wanted a hooker.

Last year she ran as city controller against both Elliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer.

Her campaign, though a longshot, was stifled when she was arrested for selling drugs in August.

Davis has said she looks forward to continuing her career as a cosmetologist once she gets out of prison.
