Known as ‘Wan Dek’ in Thailand, Children’s Day aims to give children the opportunity to have fun and to create awareness about significant role towards the development of the country.

As part of this, Government offices open to children and their families on Children’s Day, including Government House, Parliament House and various military institutions.

The Royal Thai Air Force also invites children to explore their aircraft and the Bangkok Bank distributes stationery to every child that enters the bank.
