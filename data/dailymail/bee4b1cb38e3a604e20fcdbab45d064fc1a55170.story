A selection of Newcastle's young players returned to the club's training ground on Friday to undergo fitness tests ahead of the new season.

With the two of the club's French contingent - Moussa Sissoko and Mathieu Debuchy - at the World Cup in Brazil and senior players still enjoying their break, Sammy Ameobi and Co were put through their paces.

The striker was joined by aspiring first team players Paul Dummett, Gael Bigirimana and Shane Ferguson to check how they'd kept in shape over the summer.

All three will be looking to make their mark on Alan Pardew's team next season, despite the club having already signed two new players.

Ajax midfielder Siem de Jong signed a six-year deal at St James' Park earlier this week, joining striker Ayoze Perez in the north-east after his Â£1.5million move from Tenerife earlier this summer.

The Magpies youngsters, who also included Adam Armstrong, Remi Streete and Haris Vuckic, began working with new head of fitness Dave Billows on Friday.

The former Everton employee, who spent 13 years with the Toffees, is aiming to keep Pardew's squad injury-free and at peak fitness throughout next season.
