Three men have been sentenced to death in India after they were convicted of gang-raping a 19-year-old woman.

A court in Delhi heard the teenager was kidnapped by the three man in the Qutub Vihar area of the city as she made her way home from work in Gurgaon.

Her mutilated body was discovered three days later in Rewari, Haryana, it has been reported.

The court heard the girl had been beaten and acid had been poured in to her eyes.

The prosecution said the men, two of whom were brothers, repeatedly raped and attacked the girl over the course of three days until she died in February 2012, NDTV has reported.

The court heard the men planned revenge after the girl had rejected one of the men's advances.

Last week a court convicted Ravi, Rahul and Vinod in the 'rarest of rare' case.

More than 100 people, including the girl's relatives and neighbours, gathered outside the court at every hearing to demand capital punishment for the accused.

Delhi Police had sought the death penalty for the men, who were convicted on Friday. The court heard none of the men had shown remorse during the trial.

Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said the girl was killed in a cold-blooded manner, The Indian Express has reported.

Earlier this week, the parents, above, of the victim demanded capital punishment for the rapists and murderers of their daughter

The judge said the men 'gratified their sexual lust upon the deceased by subjecting her to rape one by one'.

The men had been arrested and booked for kidnapping, unnatural sex, gang-rape and murder of a girl.

They were acquitted by the court of the charges on unnatural sex.

The mother of the girl had earlier this week told Mail Today she had no mercy in her heart for the three men who brutally raped and killed her daughter.
