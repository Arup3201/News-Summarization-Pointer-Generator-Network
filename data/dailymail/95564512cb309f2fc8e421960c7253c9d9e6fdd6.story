A Michigan man who was recently charged with possession of child pornography is now a 'person of interest' in his stepdaughter's murder. 

Family members and investigators believe James Turnquist, 47, has 'knowledge pertaining to' the death of Julia Niswender, according to the Ypsilanti Police Department. 

Niswender was suffocated and drowned in her bathtub in December 2012. 

James Turnquist, 47, is now a 'person of interest' in his stepdaughter's 2012 murder after he was arrested on February 26 for possession of child pornography 

Lt. Deric Gress said Turnquist has yet to give police a formal account of where he was in the days leading up to Niswender's murder and is thus now a 'person of interest'. 

Turnquist previously spoke out against the way his stepdaughter's homicide case was being treated by police and told 7 Action News a few months ago that the family didn't 'like the way they are handling it'.

No suspects have been named in Niswender's murder.

Turnquist was arrested on February 26 and is now in jail on $100,000 bond for unrelated child pornography charges. He has been charged with one count of possessing sexually abusive material involving a child.

Niswender's twin sister Jennifer has spoken in defense of her stepfather, who she says she is behind '100 per cent'.

'I have no idea why they're trying to link my dad to this case,' she told the Detroit Free Press. 

 'I feel like they have been kind of after him the entire time and we have no idea why.'

Jennifer said Turnquist, who she called an 'awesome father figure', took both girls in when they were 10 years old. 

She added that he has passed two polygraph tests for the case and regularly meets with detectives.
