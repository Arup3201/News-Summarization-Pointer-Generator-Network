Alan Pardew is on the brink of the sack as Newcastle boss after they were crushed 4-0 by Southampton.

His four-year tenure in charge is becoming untenable after he was the target of repeated taunts from his own fans throughout their mauling.

Newcastle fans unfurled a ‘Pardew is a Muppet’ banner before kick-off and assistant John Carver had a furious, expletive-laden exchange with fans who were holding up further banners calling for the manager to be sacked.

Defeat by Hull, who they host next Saturday, could spell the end for Pardew. After their opening four league games they are yet to win, having conceded nine and scored just four.

Repeated chants of ‘We want Pardew out’ and ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’ started when they conceded after just six minutes and punctuated the whole match. Pardew said: ‘They are fair because you can’t get beat 4-0 as Newcastle manager. It is tough to take and not that easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances.

‘We have to be strong and try and tough it out this week and come back next week. We just have to put ourselves on the line really and be brave. We have more quality than we showed today for sure. We need to get that on the pitch.

‘Until told otherwise, I’ll continue to prepare the team.’

Mike Ashley, Newcastle United's owner, watches on as his side are humiliated 4-0 at St Mary's Stadium

Pardew took charge at the club in December 2010 and two years later, after winning the Premier League and LMA manager-of-the-year award for guiding them to Europe, was handed an eight-year contract.

But just two years into that, he is on the verge of the sack. Owner Mike Ashley was at St Mary’s to witness the defeat and rarely travels to away games.

In a recent poll of 5,000 Newcastle fans in local paper the Evening Chronicle, Pardew got an 85 per cent disapproval rating.

Should the axe fall, former Everton and Manchester United manager David Moyes and Napoli boss Rafa Benitez would both be in the frame.
