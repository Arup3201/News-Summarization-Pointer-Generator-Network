In the last month alone Suki Waterhouse has closed the Burberry show, landed herself a role in a Hollywood blockbuster and designed her own range of sneakers.

Clearly not content with her lot (in between dating Bradley Cooper and partying with Cara Delevingne), the 22-year-old model is now the star of Burberry's latest beauty campaign. 

The quintessentially British fashion house, which made its first foray into beauty this year, have called on their fashion family member Suki to showcase their new mascaras, eyeliners and brow definer.

Burberry girl: Suki Waterhouse is already Burberry's golden girl - she closed the SS15 show - and now, the fashion house have called on the 22-year-old to front the new Burberry Beauty eye collection

Developed by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant Wendy Rowe, who glammed-up the girls for the SS15 show, and under the creative direction of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Bailey, the new products promise a 'youthful look of naturally sculpted, full brows with defined eyes and enhanced lashes'. 

Speaking about the new range, Wendy Rowe said: 'The new Burberry make-up products effortlessly create the illusion of a natural, larger eye.

'In order to enhance the lash and make it as natural and full as possible we have developed two new mascaras, each giving a slightly different finish.'

There's also a kohl eyeliner and eyebrow definer, which are no doubt loved by Burberry's other campaign stars, Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss. 

Suki's life as a model began after being scouted in a pub when she was 16. She quit school to pursue a career in the fashion industry and Suki is now one of Britain's most famous model faces.

By the age of 19, she was modelling lingerie for Marks and Spencer and has since worked with Swatch, H&M and Pepe Jeans. 

After several seasons of modelling for Italian trainers brand Superga, the 22-year-old has now designed her own range of super-cool sneakers. 

And clearly not content with just fashion, Suki will try her hand at acting as Marlene in the upcoming sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent, based on the book of the same name.
