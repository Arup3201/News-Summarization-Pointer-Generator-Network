Luis Enrique is insistent that Lionel Messi will remain Barcelona's chief penalty taker, but he might be wise to revise that stance.

The head coach came out fighting in defence of Messi inside the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night after the 27-year-old spurned a last-minute opportunity to almost put their tie against Manchester City to bed.

Had he converted, the Catalans would have taken a two-goal lead to the Nou Camp in three weeks.

Joe Hart saves a late penalty from Lionel Messi in Manchester City's 2-1 loss to Barcelona on Tuesday

Four-time world player of the year Messi has now missed four of his last seven penalties for Barcelona

But Messi's struggles from 12 yards continued as Joe Hart saved his spot-kick before the forward nodded wide the rebound.

Remarkably, he has somehow managed to miss four of his last seven penalties for Barcelona; that dismal record stands at five misses from 10 for club and country.

Only Thierry Henry (five) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (four) have failed to score on more occasions from penalties in Europe's premier club competition.  

Enrique, however, is unwavering in his support for Messi.

'Those who miss penalties are those who dare to take them and our penalty taker is undoubtedly Leo Messi,' he said.

'We have the utmost confidence in his capacity to take them.'

Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo are never far away, with the Portuguese scoring 54 of his 59 penalties for Real Madrid.

Messi, meanwhile, has netted 46 from the same number.

Manuel Pellegrini was buoyant in the immediate aftermath, claiming City remain in the last-16 tie because of Hart's heroics.

'It was a very important save,' said Pellegrini. 'It would have been very difficult at 3-1.

'It is not the best result to lose at home, but we will go to Barcelona to try to win. We still have the chance to do it.'
