Mother of two: Nikki Herbison died after collapsing while taking part in a 5k fun-run for charity

A mother of two collapsed and died on the hottest day of the year while taking part in a  Parkrun.

Nikki Herbison is believed to have suffered a brain haemorrhage while running to raise money for charity at her local park on Saturday morning.

The 39-year-old, a keen runner, was tackling her third Parkrun – volunteer-organised 5km events that take place every week at hundreds of locations across the country.

The free-to-enter challenges allow any standard of runner to try to beat their previous best time and can be used to raise money for charities.

Temperatures soared to 24C (75F) as Mrs Herbison took part in the event at Rushcliffe Country Park in Ruddington, Nottingham, near her family home.

After collapsing less than halfway round, she was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre but died the following afternoon.

Her husband Adrian and their two sons, aged two and five, were at the run to offer moral support.

‘I am devastated,’ he said. ‘The whole family have been very supportive and we are just trying to make sure the boys are OK at the moment.  

‘We just want them to remember their mum and that she loved them so much.’

Mr Herbison, 43, who is known to 
friends as Ade, said yesterday that he was told a woman had collapsed 
and knew it was his wife of nine years from the description he was 
given.

‘She was really 
looking forward to running the race,’ he said. ‘Luckily, people behind 
her were doctors – they stopped running to help her. I cannot praise 
them enough and there couldn’t have been a better response.’

She
 is the second Parkrunner to die in as many months. In March Steve 
Worland, 58, a cycling journalist, suffered a heart attack at a Parkrun 
in Bristol.

Mrs Herbison was
 chairman of the St Mary’s Community Park Project and had recently set 
up a donations web page and was working on funding applications.

Her
 last two posts on Facebook were about raising money for the park and a 
second project to attract donations to the Children’s Brain Tumour 
Research Centre at the University of Nottingham.

Friend
 Kate Coppinger, of Nottingham, wrote on Facebook: ‘I’ve been thinking 
and praying for her and her family such a lot over the past few days. It
 is so sad and an absolutely tragic loss.’

A statement from St Mary’s 
Community Park Project read: ‘It is with deep sadness that we inform you
 of the sudden and unexpected passing of our dear friend and chair of St
 Mary’s Community Park Project, Nikki Herbison.

‘Nikki brought huge enthusiasm and drive to the project and her sheer determination has got the project to where we are today.’

Well-wishers have suggested that a memorial be created at the park as a tribute to Nikki.

Mr
 Herbison added: ‘A memorial would be lovely and I would be really 
touched if that happened. I knew Nikki was great but I didn’t realise 
how well thought of she was. It does make me feel a bit better.’

Results of a post-mortem examination are expected within the next  few days.

Parkruns are 5km events that take place every Saturday morning at hundreds of venues across the country.

They began in 2004 and there are now at least 246 Parkrun clubs in the UK, some attended by more than 400 people every week.

The timed runs attract entrants of all abilities, and every runner’s time is posted online.

Participants can then check their time and see what place they have come in the ‘race’.

Parkruns now take place in ten countries and there are more than 760,000 registered Parkrunners.
