We've all gone hunting down the back of the sofa for spare pennies in the last few days before payday when our bank balance is looking slightly lean.

But volunteers at one homelessness charity hit the jackpot when they looked inside a donated sofa bed - and found £9,000 in cash.

The Emmaus charity shop in Batford, Hertfordshire, contacted the police in a bid to return the stash to the donor, made up of £50 notes and stuffed inside a drawstring back.

And when officers found the charitable man - a retired vegetable wholesaler in his 70s - the shop was rewarded for its honesty with a donation of £500.

The money had been lost more than a decade ago and forgotten about by its wealthy owner.

Emmaus manager Tony Ferrier, 60, said: 'The man told us he used to buy and sell vegetables from abroad in London and always dealt in cash.

'He said on that particular day it was his brother's birthday and he hid the cash in the sofa bed before going off to meet him.

'He then celebrated his brother's birthday and came home and obviously forgot all about it.

'He hadn't missed it all these years and was quite surprised when the police got in touch with him and asked him if it was his.

'He told us he and his wife had bought the sofa bed from Marks & Spencer but it had never been used.'

Tony added: 'He came to see us and told us the story and gave us £500 as a thank you which was rather nice.'

The money was found by volunteer Andy Browne as he opened up the bed.

Andy,
43, said: 'We thought it must be somebody's deposit if they were moving
house or it was an elderly person and it was their life savings.'

Emmaus is a charity which supports the homeless and helps them find work and reintegrate into society.

Reward: Staff at Emmaus handed the bundle of £50 notes back to the former owner of the sofa and he gave them a £500 donation as a reward (file picture)
