Shackled and sombre, Adrian Prout finally leads detectives to the grave of the wife he murdered.

The former businessman was driven from prison to the £1.6million country estate he shared with retired teacher Kate Prout during their seven-year marriage.

The 49-year-old had always denied harming his wife, claiming that she stormed out  on Bonfire Night in 2007 to ‘wind him up’ following a series of rows.

Prout (pictured right getting out of the van) arrived at the farm in handcuffs late this morning. He is expected to direct officers to the precise spot where he buried his wife's body

Police today focused on an area of woodland where Prout guided them during a 25 minute visit to the 276-acre farm

Wedding day: The Prouts in 2000. The shock admission came four years after Mrs Prout, a retired schoolteacher mysteriously vanished

But although her body was never found, a jury convicted him of murder last year.

Yesterday Prout was taken in a 
Mercedes Viano people carrier from Garth prison, near Blackpool, to his 
former home at Redhill Farm, Redmarley, Gloucestershire.

At the gates of the 276-acre estate 
he was transferred to a marked police car and driven down a track 
towards woodland to identify the spot where he is believed to have 
hidden his wife’s body.

Prout’s girlfriend, Debbie  Garlick, 40, who has a young daughter with the killer, lived  at Redhill Farm until two  weeks ago.

She relentlessly campaigned for his 
release and even offered £10,000 of her own money as a reward for 
information which would prove his innocence.

But in a tearful confession this 
week, Prout told Miss Garlick he had strangled his 55-year-old wife 
before burying her. Last night she told ITV: ‘Myself and my family are 
obviously devastated.’

She said she had not made any firm plans for the future.

Prout admitted the murder three 
months after failing a lie detector test which his family and Miss 
Garlick had begged him to take in the hope that it would exonerate him.

Don Cargill, chairman of the British 
and European Polygraphy Association, who conducted the test, said 
Prout’s heart rate, blood pressure, sweat and breathing patterns were 
monitored as he was asked if he killed his wife.

Mr Cargill said after failing, Prout gave a wry smile and admitted that the findings  were correct.

‘I told him that according to my 
tests, he was clearly a murderer. But he only smiled again in what was 
one of the most surreal and chilling experiences of my life.’

It is hoped that Mrs Prout's body will be found soon so that her grieving family can finally lay her to rest

Dozens of police vehicles were today dotted around the farm including diggers and 4x4s. He is thought to have strangled his wife and then used his expertise as a professional pipe-layer to bury her body on the farmland

She could have been next: Prout with fiancee Debbie Garlick shortly before his conviction

During Prout’s trial at Bristol Crown
Court, the jury heard about the couple’s disintegrating marriage. By 
2006, Mrs Prout would often stay  with friends after arguing with her 
husband.

The following year she demanded an £800,000 divorce settlement, £200,000 more  than her husband wanted to give her.

When she disappeared soon afterwards, he insisted that she had probably left for good.

Prout, who organised  commercial shoots and ran a pipe-laying firm, was convicted of murder by a 10-1 majority in February 2010.
