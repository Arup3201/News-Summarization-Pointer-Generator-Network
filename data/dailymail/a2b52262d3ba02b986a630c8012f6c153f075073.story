It may have started life as a joke, but the world's first crisp sandwich café has proved such a success   that it will now stay open beyond its initial month-long lifespan.

Businessman Andrew McMenamin had planned to keep his Simply Crispy pop-up in Belfast going for just four weeks.

But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the café will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London.

Demand: The cafe sold out of sandwiches within two hours of its opening on Monday, with diners queuing onto the streets to get their hands on the snack

'We're at the end of the first week now and it's been incredible,' Mr McMenamin told MailOnline.

'Absolutely crazy.'

The cafe sold out of sandwiches within two hours of its opening on Monday, but it is not a shortage of crisps that has left diners disappointed, but rather the bread they come in - notably the famous Belfast bap, a large crusty roll which provided people in the city with cheap food during the Famine of the 1800s.

'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door.'

Supply: The restaurant has not been running out of crisps, but rather the fresh rolls they are served in

Idea: Mr McMenamin transformed his business, That Wee Café, into the crisp sandwich shop after reading a spoof article about a ‘trendy’ establishment that was serving the ‘fashionable’ sandwiches

Mr McMenamin transformed his business, That Wee Café, into the crisp sandwich shop after reading a spoof article about a ‘trendy’ establishment that was serving the ‘fashionable’ sandwiches on a satirical website.

The online article received hundreds of comments in praise of the idea,  prompting Mr McMenamin to make it a reality.  

Diners at the café can choose from 35 different crisp flavours and three different types of bread on which to make their ham and cheese sandwich.

The £3.50 dish is served with soup – topped with croutons made from Monster Munch crisps – and chips.

Mr McMenamin said he had been thrilled with the response from diners, and will now keep the pop-up running longer than the four weeks he had initially banked on. 

'The plan is to keep going until the end of March, ' he said. 

'We will keep doing it until we sense that people have had enough - and they will tell us via TripAdvisor or Twitter. 

'We've had queues around the block. The majority of people get what we are about and they do not take it seriously. The crisps are good, the sandwiches are good so the reaction has been mostly positive so I am happy with how it's gone.

Mr McMenamin said he had not looked at this week's takings in detail, but said they were more than That Wee Cafe would usually take.

We've had some calls from Derry, from a few places in Northern Ireland and from Dublin. I'm not sure if anyone will set one up yet though, we will see how it goes.'

Mr McMenamin said he had no immediate plans to take on fellow novelty cafe Cereal Killers - the east London restaurant which sells 120 varieties of breakfast cereal for £3.20 a bowl.

But questioned about taking the venture to London he said: 'We would love to do that.

'We wanted to try and get a couple of months here and see if it has longevity. It is a fad and we don't want to outstay our welcome.

Celebrity fan: The crisp sandwiches are starting to gain something of a celebrity following, with Belfast boxer Carl Frampton even being honoured with a sandwich named 'The Jackal' in his honour

'We can always revert back to what we were doing before the crisps.'

Mr McMenamin described the global interest in the cafe as 'bizarre'. He added: 'We were expecting maybe a couple of local newspapers to pick up the story but we've had people from all over the world interested.'

And the crisp sandwiches are starting to gain something of a celebrity following, with Belfast boxer Carl Frampton even being honoured with a sandwich named 'The Jackal' in his honour.

'Carl Frampton was a customer of ours previously. We initially did a breakfast bap and he wants us to put crisps on it.

'He tweeted that he's got a match coming up so he's on a strict diet but we will make him one after the match.'

'We'll see what happens next. We will know when it's run its course because our customers will let us know, but until then we'll keep going.'
