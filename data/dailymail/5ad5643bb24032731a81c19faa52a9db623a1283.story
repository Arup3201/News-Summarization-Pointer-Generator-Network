An autistic teenager was suspended from his middle school after showing off a picture of a bomb he had drawn.

Rhett Parham's mother, Amy, was stunned by the school's response on Monday and said her 13-year-old son was incapable of making any explosives.

But his Greenville, South Carolina school disagreed and set a hearing to decide whether Rhett's actions posed a threat to his classmates.

Disciplined: Rhett was suspended from school for bringing in this drawing of a bomb

Disbelief: Rhett with his mother, Amy Parham, who was shocked at the school's reaction

Rhett got into trouble with Hillcrest Middle School in Greenville after drawing a picture of a cartoon bomb from his favorite video game, Bomber Man.

Mrs Parham, who has appeared on TV show The Biggest Loser with her husband Phil, claimed school administrators said they knew Rhett wasn't a threat but they were worried about how his actions would be perceived by other parents.

'I'm angry. I'm upset and I'm incredulous, honestly, that a child could come in and bring a drawing and that's somehow perceived as a threat - especially someone with special needs who really doesn't filter information the same way that typical children do,' Mrs Parham told WPTV.

The mother-of-three added that the school knew he didn't have a bomb and wasn't planning on making one, but felt it needed to make an example of him.

'They were worried about their perception,' she told Fox News. 'Perception is reality, and parents might think you have a 
bomb or [might be] violent.'

Banned: The autistic teenager was sent home from Hillcrest Middle School on Monday

Innocent: Amy Parham says Rhett poses no threat and would not be able to make a real bomb

Rhett's mother has considered moving him to a new school but resisted because the teenager is happy there.

'I like the school and it's great,' Rhett told WSPA.

His future at Hillcrest was discussed by a school 'manifestation' hearing on Wednesday, which met to decide if his behavior was influenced by his disability.

A statement from Greenville County Schools said: 'This investigation began when threatening comments were made, resulting in the responsible removal of the student from the school to ensure everyone's safety while the incident and intent were assessed.'

South Carolina's education association director Janet Stein added that the school principal had acted in the best interests of the students.

'Principals are in a very difficult spot with this ... if something had happened, the district would have been accountable for that.'

At a two-hour hearing today the school decided Rhett's actions had been influenced by his autism and agreed to revoke the suspension.
