Michael Carberry is back in the England frame after being included in both the Twenty20 and one-day international squads to take on Sri Lanka.

England's 13-man Twenty20 squad, led by Eoin Morgan in place of the injured Stuart Broad for a one-off match at The Oval next week, is also notable for the return to the shortest format of Ian Bell and the absence of Michael Lumb.

Seamers Harry Gurney, who made his international debut in a reduced 50-over match against Scotland last week, and Tim Bresnan - after his late start to the season - are also in both squads.

Return: Carberry played well last summer but was dropped during a poor winter for England

In form: Ian Bell was England's highest scorer in last week's shortened ODI against Scotland

Ashes opener Carberry was outspoken about his omission from the team in an ODI series against Australia last winter, having fared well in the 50-over format when England took on the same opponents at home.

That was under then limited-overs coach Ashley Giles, however, and the 33-year-old Hampshire batsman - uncapped in Twenty20s - is back at the start of Peter Moores' regime.

He appears set to challenge for a Twenty20 opening spot, alongside Alex Hales, with Bell - who has not played in the sprint format in more than three years.

In a 14-man list initially for the first three of five ODIs against Sri Lanka, Bresnan and Carberry are added to the 13 who were chosen to face Scotland, with Moeen Ali dropping out.
