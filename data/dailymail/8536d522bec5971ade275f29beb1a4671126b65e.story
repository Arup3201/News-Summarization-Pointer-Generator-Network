It was a hilarious example of how Baroness Thatcher was a woman who stayed true to her beliefs - and wouldn’t accept any nonsense.

A video has emerged from September 1995 of the former prime minister repeatedly denying the requests of popular Swedish interviewer Stina Lundberg Dabrowski, 62, to jump on screen for her.

As one of her only guests to ever decline the jump, Lady Thatcher said: ‘I see no significance whatsoever in making a jump up in the air. I made great leaps forward, not little jumps in studios.’

'No, no, no': A video has emerged from September 1995 of Baroness Thatcher repeatedly denying the requests of popular Swedish interviewer Stina Lundberg Dabrowski to jump on screen for her

Refusing: As one of the presenters only guests to ever decline the jump, Lady Thatcher said: 'I see no significance whatsoever in making a jump up in the air. I made great leaps forward, not little jumps in studios'

Award-winning Ms Dabrowski, who was named Sweden's 'best TV personality of all time' in 2005, has also interviewed former U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

And when Ms Dabrowski told Lady Thatcher that Gorbachev had done a jump, she responded: ‘You amaze me. I wonder what he thought to the politics of a free society, if that's what they ask you to do.’

The presenter told her: ‘All the people that I interview, I ask them to do something for me. It's a kind of gimmick on my show. It's to make a jump, just to stand up and make a jump up in the air.’

But Lady Thatcher responded by saying: ‘Shouldn’t dream of it, I think it's a silly thing to ask, I think it's a puerile thing to ask, yes.’ She later added that she was 'used to doing more than little jumps’.

Ms Dabrowski continued to press her, saying: ‘It's hard for you to show what you do in an interview, but you can stand up and you can make a little jump - it just shows another side.’

But she denied her requests saying: ‘I'll
tell you what it shows - it shows that you want to be thought to be 
normal or popular. I don't have to say that and approve it. This has 
been my whole life.’

Standing firm: To finish, Lady Thatcher sternly said: 'Alright, no. "No, no, no", to coin a phrase. I do not wish to lose the respect of people whose respect I've kept for years.'

And to finish the interview on channel TV4, Lady Thatcher sternly said: ‘Alright, no. “No, no, no”, to coin a phrase. I do not wish to lose the respect of people whose respect I've kept for years.’

'She had a reputation for being the Iron Lady, which she really lived up to. She refused to jump, but she did it in such a funny way that I just laughed out loud and thought she was so incredibly amazing, and humorous'

In an interview on Monday during which she reflected on their conversation in September 1995, Ms Dabrowski told SVT News: 'Thatcher is the toughest person I've ever interviewed.

‘I was completely covered in sweat afterwards. She stared at me and shook her index finger when she did not like my questions, and said she would give me a lesson in asking questions the right way.

'She had a reputation for being the Iron Lady, which she really lived up to. She refused to jump, but she did it in such a funny way that I just laughed out loud and thought she was so incredibly amazing, and humorous.'

Following Lady Thatcher's death in central London on Monday aged 87, Ms Dabrowski added: 'The world has lost the toughest woman who ever lived.'
