It's been a busy week for Cressida Bonas - from attending glittering BAFTA parties in LA to being announced as the latest muse for Mulberry.

But now Prince Harry's former girlfriend is firmly back on British soil, landing in Heathrow airport this afternoon looking casual in cashmere jogging bottoms and a pair of white high-top trainers.

The 25-year-old actress, who is famous for her relaxed style, looked polished despite the long flight from LAX airport.

She has just had a whirlwind weekend at the Golden Globes and been named the face of Mulberry, so it was a little surprising to see Cressida with a Louis Vuitton handbag.

Perhaps Cressida had had her fill of Mulberry for one weekend, after wearing two identical dresses by the brand, one in black and one white.

We love her tote here though, but of course a serious piece of arm candy like that will set you back a bob or two. At just over $4k, Cressida's handbag is a little eye-watering, but it's just too pretty for words. Worth the dosh? Absolutely. Click right to snap it up.

Cressida rocked several red carpet looks during her stay in LA and the stateside style appeared to have rubbed off her, returning to England with a glowing tan and blow-dried hair.

However, despite her recent affiliation with British designer Mulberry, Cressida carried a pink Louis Vuitton leather bag, rather than a Mulberry.

She teamed the luxury item with a patterned blouse and navy wool coat.

Yesterday saw the announcement that the young actress has been snapped up to star in Mulberry's upcoming video. 

Cressida will star in a new video by the British label, during which she shows off her  dance skills with a mixture of 'improvised' and rehearsed steps. 

Speaking about her coup, the blonde thespian told Yahoo Style: 'I think it was just about being free and happy, and having fun.

'The idea was, "dance as if you're dancing in your kitchen". It was more about a dance that was improvised, and not all about the steps. It was really just about having fun.'

The blonde beauty - who appears in the short film alongside actor Freddie Fox - was cast in the ads after talent spotters at her final dance performance before her graduation from the University of Leeds were 'charmed by her movement which inspired the concept'.

The video, which is set to be released in March, made its debut in Los Angeles over the weekend at a star-studded party, with guests including fellow Mulberry model Cara Delevingne and Keira Knightley.

The British-born model has been holding court with the A-listers at recent events in Los Angeles.

The former girlfriend of Prince Harry headed up a Brit pack including Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine town.

And it seems trained dancer Cressida, who is making her acting debut next year, fit right in with the crowd of actors and film producers.  

She was spotted chatting  to Downton star Joanne Froggatt at the event, which was held ahead of the Golden Globes.

The party is an annual affair and was held at the beautiful Four Seasons Hotel in Beverley Hills. 

Cressida has made no secret of her desire to have her own career and was recently praised by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

He said: 'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her,' said Weinstein.

The aristocrat is  set to star in Harvey's film Tulip Fever, alongside Cara and Dame Judy Dench, playing Mrs Steen, a merchant's wife.

Harvey went on to praise Cressida for not using her relationship with Prince Harry to her advantage, saying: 'She is not taking advantage of any media profile.' 

Although she and Harry have remained close friends it is thought that Cressida struggled with dating the Prince. 

It was widely reported that she did not wish to enter into the royal way of life and be thrust into the spotlight because of her romance.
