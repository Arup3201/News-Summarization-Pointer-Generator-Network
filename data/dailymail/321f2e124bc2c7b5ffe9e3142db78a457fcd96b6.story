A student cheated death after crashing his motorbike and sliding under the wheels of a lorry.

Jason Mawe, 25, was riding from his home in Reepham, Norfolk, to his college when the car in front braked suddenly and he ploughed into the back of the vehicle.

The photography student slid sideways under an oncoming 30-tonne scrap metal lorry which crushed his arm into a dozen pieces before ripping the helmet from his head.

But Mr Mawe, who was discovered in the road by his own mother, walked away from the crash with a severely broken right arm and just a scratch on his head.

The rider has now had the final operation to repair his damaged arm - and is preparing to get back on his bike for the first time since the horror smash.

He said: ‘I don’t remember the accident itself, but it went over my arm first, hit my elbow, and then crushed my helmet when it went over my head. There was nothing left of my helmet.

‘It was a fully-laden lorry at the time and the driver said it would have weighed about 30 tonnes. 

'He got out and was like, “Oh my God, I’ve run over this guy, there’s going to be nothing left”. But I was conscious. Apparently I was screaming and shouting and swearing. I do feel really lucky.’

Mr Mawe was riding his 125cc Suzuki Epicuro when he rounded a blind bed and crashed into a static car in March 2009.

A shocked passer-by called an ambulance which took him to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, just after his mother Jenny, 45, arrived with his older brother Lee, 26.

Medics initially feared they would have to amputate his arm - but, after finding a pulse, patched it back together with three titanium pins and skin grafts from his leg during a series of operations.

He spent three weeks in hospital and returned to college two months later.

But his arm snapped again when one of the pins failed, and he had to have some bone from his hip inserted into his upper arm a year after the accident.

He had a final operation to remove a pin from his elbow just last year.

‘There was this really sharp corner on a really narrow road and some guy ahead of me stopped to let the lorry go past,’ said Mr Mawe, who is now studying at the University of East Anglia.

‘I put my brakes on at the last minute and went into the back of the car, and fell sideways into the path of this huge lorry.

‘There was a huge gouge in the side of my arm that was so hard to pull together - it was so stretched out. They had to take a skin graft from my inside leg.

‘The bottom part of the arm was broken and the top part was really badly broken too, and my elbow was in eight pieces, but despite being run over by a lorry there was nothing wrong with my head. I do feel lucky, really lucky not to have lost my arm. 

'There was a point where they couldn’t find a pulse for quite a while and they were in two minds about whether they should take it off or continue.’

‘I haven’t been back on a bike since, but I do miss it. My brother has bought himself a proper 1000cc motorbike and him and my dad are planning a trip across Europe next summer.

‘I would feel pretty rubbish being at home while they are doing that. I do fancy getting back on it now. I just have to get my confidence back up.’
