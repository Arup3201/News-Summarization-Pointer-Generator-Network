A top Tory has said that he would not 'shed a tear' if Britain votes to leave the European Union.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said that the 'most important thing' was for voters to be given a choice on the issue – but said he would not mind they chose to leave.

Mr Javid also lashed out at the police for using anti-terror powers to 'undermine' the freedom of the press by accessing journalists' mobile phone records.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said that he would not 'shed a tear' if Britain votes to leave the European Union

The millionaire former banker, speaking at a Westminster lunch, insisted he was 'not making any plans to lead any party' after being questioned about his future ambitions.

It comes amid growing speculation that Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, is being lined up as the candidate of the Conservative Eurosceptic right.

The Culture Secretary said has previously said Britain should not be frightened of cutting ties with Brussels.

But, when asked if he would regret Britain leaving the union, he said: 'The most important thing is that the British people are given a choice. I'm pleased that the Conservatives are absolutely committed to that, and that is what will happen if we win the election.

'Would I shed a tear? No.'

The remarks came after he announced new safeguards requiring police to obtain authorisation from a judge before accessing journalists' phone records could be put in place before the general election in May.

The protection was recommended by a report from the Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May, which Home Secretary Theresa May accepted in full on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has written to Mrs May urging her to bring forward legislation before the end of the month.

Mr Javid told a lunch of Westminster political journalists he was 'shocked' by the extent of official snooping on journalists revealed by Sir Anthony' s report. He said there was 'no excuse' for the authorities using powers created to tackle terrorism as a tool to prevent scrutiny by reporters.

The Culture Secretary said: 'Democracy needs journalists to function.

That is why last month's attacks in Paris struck a chord around the world. They weren't just an attack on a magazine, they were an attack on the ideals that underpin our way of life.

'Our journalists also face insidious threats from other quarters, be they commercial, judicial or political. Yesterday, we learnt the full extent to which Ripa (the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) was used to monitor journalists and their contacts.

'Like many of you, I was shocked by what was revealed.

'In Paris we saw terrorists attacking the fundamental freedoms of the media, so I was appalled to discover that legislation created to hamper terrorists was now being used to undermine those very same freedoms.'

Home Secretary Theresa May will bring forward plans to stop police accessing journalists' phone records without a warrant

Mr Javid said he had raised concerns with ministerial colleagues and welcomed Mrs May's announcement that the law would be reformed.

'The Prime Minister has confirmed that judicial approval will now be required before Ripa is used to access journalists' data,' he said. 'It is a great victory for everyone who believes in press freedom.

'I want to see the law changed to make it happen during this Parliament, because there is no excuse for using anti-terror legislation to threaten legitimate reporting, no matter how awkward that reporting might be.

'Blowing a whistle on council corruption doesn't warrant undercover surveillance. A front page that embarrasses a senior politician is not a threat to national security. Journalism is not terrorism.'

Mr Javid said that the correspondents reporting on politics in the parliamentary lobby were 'just as much part of our democracy as the MPs that sit in the chamber' and told his audience of political journalists:

'If you are not free to go about your legitimate business, it is our democracy that suffers.'

Sir Anthony's review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row.

The report found that Ripa did not 'provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources' and concluded: 'It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information.'

In a statement welcoming the findings, Mrs May said: 'A free press is fundamental to a free society and the Government is determined that nothing is done that puts that at risk.'

In his report, Sir Anthony found that over a three-year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists.

Some 608 applications for such data were authorised by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1% of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation.

It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not 'randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources'.
