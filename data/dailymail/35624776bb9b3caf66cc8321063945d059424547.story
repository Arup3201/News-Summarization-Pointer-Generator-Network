Sylwia studied nursing at the University of Medicine in Posada, a village in southern Poland.

Her distraught mother Bernadeta, 44, said: 'Going to Spain was a dream come true for my daughter.

'She had taught herself the language and was hoping to work there in the future after finishing her studies.

'She was a beautiful, smiling girl who had her whole life ahead of her.

'It's hard to believe what's happened, that I will never see Sylvia again.

'That I won't hug her and will never be able to tell her how much I love her and how proud I was of her.

'It breaks my heart, I feel this is a nightmare that is not happening.'
