The Countess of Wessex showed off her sewing skills during a reception for a group of Girl Guides at Buckingham Palace this afternoon.

Sophie, who spent the early part of this week in Zambia where she attended the funeral of President Michael Sata, helped put the finishing touches to a charity quilt.

A delighted Sophie also got a hug from diabetes ambassador Lucy Upton, who had been given the job of presenting a posy but chose to add a cuddle too.

The quilt making party was held in support of the Sensational Sew1 Challenge, a project that aims to raise awareness and find funds for a cure for Type 1 diabetes.

Inspired by Juliet Fynn, 16, a member of the 10th Romford Senior Section who was diagnosed with the illness in 2008, Girl Guide groups all over the country have been making patches for the quilt - and have raised more than £1,000 so far.

Sophie, who is the president of the Girl Guide Association, added the final stitches to the quilt which will be auctioned off later this month. 

Miss Fynn, who has since been appointed a youth ambassador for JDRF, the Type 1 diabetes charity, described the project as 'rewarding'.

 'The Spectacular Sew1 Challenge is important to me because I will have had Type 1 diabetes for seven years next August,' she explained.

'I want to do as much as possible to help the Type 1 diabetes charity JDRF in their quest to find a cure for T1 diabetes.'

'Guide groups across the UK should be proud of themselves for choosing to take on the Spectacular Sew1 Challenge,' added Chief Guide Gill Slocombe. 

'They have raised awareness and funds for an important charity for young people, the JDRF. 

'Girlguiding members have a proud history of social action and stepping up to help other people – long may it continue.'

Type 1 diabetes is the more dangerous strain of the disease and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce any insulin whatsoever.

Although usually diagnosed in childhood, symptoms can begin at any age up to 40 and in rare cases, can start at a later age - as in the case of Home Secretary Theresa May. 

'Type 1 diabetes is on the rise in the UK and diagnosis can often occur at a young age,' added Karen Addington, Chief Executive of JDRF.

'It’s a challenging condition and requires constant management. So my warmest thanks to Juliet, Girlguiding and everyone who has contributed to the Sew 1 challenge – for raising vital awareness and supporting our mission to cure the condition.'
