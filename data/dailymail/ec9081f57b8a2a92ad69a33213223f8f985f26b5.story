Three prominent hedge fund managers each made more than $2 billion in 2011, a year when most traders failed to earn money for their wealthy customers, according to an annual survey by AR magazine.

Collectively, however, this exclusive group of the 25 richest hedge fund managers took a 35 per cent pay cut last year, when the average hedge fund lost 5 per cent.

Raymond Dalio clocked in at the top 
spot, earning nearly $4billion as his Connecticut-based Bridgewater 
Associates was one of the top-performing funds, with returns of about 20
per cent.

Septuagenarians Carl Icahn, who runs Icahn Capital, and James Simons, who retired from Renaissance Technologies Corp, also had multibillion-dollar earnings, rounding out the top three.

Noticeably absent from the AR ladder was 2010's top earner, John Paulson, who fell off the list entirely after a miserable year in which one of his biggest portfolios lost more than half its value, and his flagship Advantage Fund lost 36 per cent.

Mr Paulson reportedly earned $4.9 billion in 2010.

AR's 'rich list' of top hedge fund earners showed the group raked in $14.4 billion, down from $22 billion the year before.

But Mr Paulson was not the only manager who quite literally experienced a change in fortune.

Whipsawing markets last year hobbled many of the previous year's top earners. Fifteen managers who were part of the AR rich list in 2010 didn't make the cut in 2011.

Raymond Dalio, 62, made $3.9billionMr Dalio helms the prestigious Bridgewater Associates, which has nearly $120billion in assets. He is worth an estimated $10billion. A graduate of Harvard University and Long Island University, Mr Dalio ranks #44 in the Forbes 400. He is known for his harsh business practices, which, according to Forbes, include videotaping all meetings and requiring brutal honesty from all staffers.

Carl Icahn, 76, made $2.5billionA New York University dropout, Ichan married his long-time assistant Gail Golden after he divorced his first wife in 1990. She told the New Yorker in 2006 that she and her husband take nightly baths in their luxurious Fifth Avenue penthouse. He is worth more than $14billion, and ranks #25 on the Forbes 400. He made $2.5billion from Icahn Capital ManagementJames Simons, 73, made $2.1billionThe 73-year-old attended both MIT and UC Berkeley, and has an estimated net worth of $10.7billion. He is ranked 30 in Forbes 400. Renaissance Technologies now has more than $15billion under management. The notoriously press-shy former math professor and his second wife, Marilyn Hawrys Simons, have donated more than $200million to Stony Brook University. He is involved in several other charitable foundations.

Ken Griffin, 43, made $700millionGriffin
knows how to live large – he had his wedding reception at the Palace of
Versailles, owns at least three properties, and donated $17million wing
at Chicago Institute of Art. He has an estimated net worth of 
$3billion, and ranks as #171 of Forbes 400. He also donated $150,000 to 
the Mitt Romney Super PAC.

Steve Cohen, 56, $585 millionThe founder of SAC Capital Advisors, Cohen has an estimated net worth of $8.3billion. He also owns 35,000 square foot mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, complete with separate Zamboni garage. He owns a four per cent stake in the New York Mets, and has a world-class collection of art. He graduated from the prestigious Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2010, he and his wife pledged $50million to the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.

Activist investor Carl Icahn earned 
$2.5 billion during a year that his firm made about 35 per cent and 
mathematics professor turned hedge fund founder James Simons made $2.1 
billion. 

Citadel's Kenneth
Griffin and SAC Capital Advisors' Steve Cohen, long-time top earners, 
rounded out the top five, taking home $700 million and $585 million, 
respectively.

Mr Griffin is known as a high-roller. Worth an estimated $3billion, he had his lavish wedding reception at the Palace of Versailles in 2004, marrying Harvard Business grad Anne Dias.

Mrs Dias-Griffin herself has spot-on business chops, having worked at Goldman Sachs and founding Chicago-based Aragon Global Management.

Despite owning at least three properties, they are a charitable couple, donating $19million to the Art Institute of Chicago for a modern art wing.

Mr Dalio, Mr Simons, and Mr Cohen cruised into top positions for the second year in a row, though in 2010 each of their paydays was bigger, according to AR's calculations.

Hedge funds managers typically charge investors two per cent for managing their money, meaning that the industry's very largest funds often present their managers with the biggest checks.

In good years, managers can also skim off 20 per cent or more of the profits from their trades.

New arrivals to the top 25 in 2011 included Mr Dalio's deputies at Bridgewater, Greg Jensen and Robert Prince, the firm's co-chief investment officers. Industry veteran Paul Singer of Elliott Management Corp also scored a place in the exclusive group.

AR has been estimating industry compensation since 2011 and the list is always closely watched, especially now that Wall Street pay checks are being scrutinized extra hard after the 2008 financial crisis.

AR's rankings closely correspond to the Forbes magazine list of 40 highest-earning managers of 2011, though the amount of compensation varies. In that survey the top 40 profit-makers pocketed $13.2 billion.

Mr Dalio topped the chart on that list too. However, Forbes estimated his earnings at about $3billion, about $1billion less than AR calculated.

Determining the earnings of top hedge fund managers requires some amount of guesswork, since funds do not publicly disclose compensation.

AR bases its estimates on the fees charged by funds and the percentage of capital a manager is believed to have in his fund.

On the Forbes list, Mr Simons was runner-up to Mr Dalio instead of AR's No. 2 placeholder, Icahn, who placed third.
