George Washington believed honesty was the most enviable quality in a human being, but the residents of the city that bears his name clearly don't agree.

People in Washington D.C. are by far the most dishonest in America, according to a new study, while their cousins in Hawaii and Alabama are basically saints.

Beverage company Honest Tea went to every U.S. state earlier this month and set up 61 unmanned kiosks offering tea for $1. Tea drinkers were instructed to place their buck in a box nearby.

But only eight in 10 beverage guzzlers in the nation's capital paid for their tea, while the other 20 per cent of people skipped out on the minimal amount.

Washington's wise words: 'I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man'

The other states where you should hold on to your purse were West Virginia where only 85 per cent of participants paid for their tea, followed by Texas and Kentucky at 87 per cent.

In comparison, everyone in Hawaii and Alabama paid up without exception.

Indiana and Maine followed closely behind, with some 99 per cent proving to be honest, according to the company's fifth annual test.

This year, however, was the first year every state has been represented.

Unlike the city that shares its name, Washington state seemed to honor it's Founding Father's sentiment, scoring 96 per cent â€” considerably higher than the national average of 92 per cent.

'Even though my bicycle was stolen the same day as our DC experiment, it's reassuring to know that 92 per cent of Americans will do the right thing even when it seems no one is watching,' Honest Tea co-founder Seth Goldman said.

New York ranked in the middle of the pack at 91 per cent, which was better than people expected.

California tied with New Jersey, with a score of 96 per cent.

The results also determined which sex
 was more honest than the other and women slightly edged out men with a 
score of 95 per cent compared to 91 per cent.

Unlike last year where redheads were most honest, in 2013 blondes were the most likely to pay, scoring 95 per cent, followed by brunettes, at 93 per cent and then redheads at 92 per cent.

People with short hair were 91 per cent honest, vs. people with medium and long hair who were 93 per cent and 94 per cent honest, respectively.

People in groups tended to be more honest than people on their own, perhaps because they were bullied by their friends.
