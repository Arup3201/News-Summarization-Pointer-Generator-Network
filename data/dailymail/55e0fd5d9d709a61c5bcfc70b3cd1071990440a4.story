To eat or not to eat - that is the question

A cake making fan of the Bard has created an intricate three-tiered cake to celebrate the work of Britain's greatest playwright - with some of his best-known characters adorning the icing.

Ally College, from Rugby, Warwickshire, created edible versions of some of the greatest characters in literary history.

Lady MacBeth, Romeo and Juliet, and ill-fated Egyptian Queen Cleopatra have all had the sugar craft treatment.

A fan of the Bard has created a stunning three-tiered cake to celebrate the work of Britain's greatest playwright

'Give me my robe, put on my crown. I have Immortal longings in me' The cake maker recreates Cleopatra's dramatic death by asp. This sweet treat looks like it has a slightly happier ending

Double, Double toil and trouble. Macbeth's three witches don't seem to fancy the cake much instead preferring their cauldron full of eye of newt and toe of frog

And three scheming witches stand round a bubbling cauldron on another tier - just feet away from a collapsed Julius Caesar - spotted with red food dye.

A cloaked Prospero from the Tempest stands with his staff on the bottom layer - as a hunchbacked Richard III peers around the corner of the cake.

And the whole cast of characters are presided over by a charming icing sugar figure of Shakespeare himself, topping the cake.

A contemplative Hamlet considers the skull of his pal Yorick, while Lady Macbeth stalks the cake with 'blood stained (cherry icing flavoured) hands

Iago crouches behind an oblivious Othello, while Bottom takes a break from his comic antics to slip into a Midsummer Night's Dream

Ms College, who runs cake shop Mrs Crumbs the Baker, created the masterpiece to raise money for Stratford -upon-Avon based Warwickshire & Northamptonshire Air Ambulance - who will receive funds when the cake is raffled off.

The mother of two spent two weeks meticulously crafting the cake.

She said: 'I love Shakespeare so this really was a labour of love.

A mischievous Puck from a Midsummer Night's Dream crouches by a sleeping Titania, ready to administer the love potion

'I wanted to help raise some money, and I thought it would be great to bake a cake that would have meaning to the local area.

'Luckily, a lot of Shakespeare's characters are easily recognisable, so they weren't too difficult to create - if a bit fiddly.'
