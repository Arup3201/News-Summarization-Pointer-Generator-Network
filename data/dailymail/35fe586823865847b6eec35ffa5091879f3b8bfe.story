They are two of the most glamorous of Europe's royals and today was no exception for the Netherlands' Queen Maxima and Denmark's Crown Princess Mary.

The two royals were visiting the carbon-neutral Samsø island, a small speck of land just off Denmark's Jutland Peninsula, and just about managed to hold on to their hats during a blustery ferry ride there.

Thanks to the churning Baltic waves, the two also suffered a wobbly moment as the ferry, called Kalhave, lurched beneath them.

Hats off to Mary and Maxima! The Dutch and Danish royals were glamorous in matching trilbies

70s redux: Maxima had nailed this season's 70s trend with her tailored camel coat

Maxima, 43, was resplendent in a fitted camel wool coat-dress while Australian-born Mary, also 43, opted for a chic grey cape coat.

Joined by Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and King Willem-Alexander, 47, the two royals, who are long-standing friends, traded quips as they made the crossing.

Glamorous though the royals looked, they looked even more so during an evening reception celebrating Dutch culture at the Royal Library in Copenhagen.

Maxima, resplendent in a russet one-shoulder floor-length gown studded with rhinestones, showed no sign of fatigue, instead displaying a gorgeous golden tan.

The royal kept things informal, however, by wearing her long blonde hair loose and curled while Willem-Alexander was dapper in his dinner jacket.

Convivial: King Willem-Alexander cracked a joke as he posed with the Danish royals outside the venue 

Not to be outdone, Crown Princess Mary was striking in a chic strapless black dress with a flattering empire-line cut.

In contrast to her Dutch counterpart, the Australian-born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye-catching diamond-shaped gold earrings.

Equally glamorous was Denmark's Queen Margrethe who donned a rose-pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug.

The men too looked good, with Margrethe's husband Prince Henrik natty in a dark blue dinner jacket while their son Frederik scrubbed up well in a matching number.

Glowing: Maxima traded her usual large jewels for a discreet diamond necklace and matching earrings 

The cultural celebration topped a busy day in which the two sets of European royalty experienced the best of Danish weather on a sunny but  blustery ferry crossing.

The Dutch royals are currently in the middle of a three-day trip that began on Tuesday with a royal welcome at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport.

After spending a low-key afternoon meeting students at the University of Aalborg, things took a turn for the glamorous during their first evening, courtesy of a banquet at Christiansborg Palace.

With Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the Scandinavian country's 74-year-old monarch Queen Margrethe also in the room, the dinner saw plenty of toasts - and even better fashion. 

All smiles: The two royal couples appeared to be in good spirits as they arrived on Samsø island

Hanging on: At one point, the Baltic breeze threatened to send both royals' hats flying

As is her wont, Maxima pulled out all the stops in royal blue, while Queen Margrethe rose to the occasion in a spectacular pale blue dress.

Not to be outdone, Crown Princess Mary looked wonderful in white, while her sister-in-law, French-born Princess Marie, shimmered in lilac.

On Wednesday morning, it was back to business with the two couples travelling to Samsø Island to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole.

Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music.

The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, with pupils giving the royal party, among them sport-mad Frederik, a tour of the school.

Frederik and Mary have suffered a bumpy few months, thanks to a film about the Crown Prince's playboy past that is set to be screened later this year.

A second programme, this time being made for Australia's Channel Ten, could also cause some discomfort, thanks to claims that Mary had had second thoughts in the run-up to her 2004 wedding.

By contrast, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late, with Maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular.

One of the most glamorous royals in Europe, the Argentina-born mother-of-three has proved a hit with her Dutch subjects, thanks in no small part to her charity work.

She will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week's state visit, with a trip to Bispebjerg Hospital also on their itinerary today.
