A nine-year-old boy with a brain tumour told there was 'no hope' has defied expectations to beat cancer for the second time - just in time for Christmas.

Shane Edwards, from Bradford, was first diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in February 2012, when he was just six years old.

After undergoing two major operations, radiotherapy and months of chemotherapy, scans showed he was cancer-free and his family believed he had beat the disease.

But they were hit with another bombshell in July this year, when they were told his cancer had returned.

Doctors broke the heartbreaking news that there was 'no hope', but his family begged them to continue treatment.

Due to Mrs Edwards' insistence, Shane received treatment and was taking chemotherapy tablets at home. 

Three months later, to their utter relief, a scan has revealed Shane has defied medics - as the tumour seems to have disappeared.

He is now looking forward to spending Christmas day with his twin brother Scott, his two older brothers, Callum, 11, and Kyle, 12, and his parents Tracey and Philip.

Mrs Edwards, 33, said Shane has just finished his fourth round of chemotherapy and the family will spoil the youngster this Christmas after such a traumatic year.

'We were devastated when the doctors told us the cancer had come back,' she said. 

'Shane had been clear for over two years and we could not believe it. It is such a relief to hear the tumour has gone once again.

'We thought there would be a little bit of shrinkage following the chemotherapy, but we didn't expect the tumour to be totally gone.

'Now we can really celebrate Christmas without the worry of thinking about it. All the boys are going to be extra spoilt this year.'

Shane will still have to undergo two further courses of chemotherapy at Leeds General Infirmary, which will finish in March, but doctors have dropped his regular scans from every three months to every six months.

Mrs Edwards has also thanked a number of friends, family and well-wishers that helped raise money to pay for treatment, and for items on Shane's wish list, such as a petrol buggy.

She and her husband were completely devastated when Shane was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012.

After suffering intense headaches, and doctors ruling out various causes, he was eventually sent for a scan.

His parents were devastated to be told he had a particularly fast-growing tumour called a grade 4 glioblastoma.

According to Cancer Research UK, only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years.

A glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast-growing form of brain tumour.

Fast growing tumours are much more likely to come back after treatment than slow growing tumours. 

The outlook is not good for people with more aggressive grade 3 and 4 tumours.

Only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years. 

Many adults live for less than a year.

Despite the poor odds, Shane underwent two major operations as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

His parents were delighted to hear the treatment had kept the cancer at bay.

Months of regular scans came back clear, and they believed they could breathe a sigh of relief.

However,  another headache he suffered in July this year rang alarm bells, and further tests showed the tumour had returned. 

Following the chemotherapy tablets and a recent scan, Shane's consultant in paediatric oncology, Dr Sue Picton, confirmed the tumour seemed to have disappeared, although he would have to continue his chemotherapy until the course is complete.

Dr Picton said: 'This is really great news for Shane and his family.

'We're really pleased that the tumour seems to have responded so well to the chemotherapy treatment, and while not out of the woods just yet, this response to chemotherapy is much better than I expected.'

Mrs Edwards added: 'I could not thank the staff at Leeds General Infirmary enough. They are all really good with Shane.'
