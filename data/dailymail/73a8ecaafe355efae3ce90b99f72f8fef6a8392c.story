England captain Wayne Rooney was delighted with the patience shown by his side as they caught Switzerland twice on the counter to win 2-0 and get off the mark in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

Switzerland are expected to be England's closest competitors in Group E, but Danny Welbeck's double gave England an early headstart in the race to qualify.

'We've put the work in, we worked on our defensive shape when we haven't got the ball and then springing from defence into attack, which you see with the goals tonight,' Rooney told ITV.

'We're pleased that the things we've worked on have paid off so it's a happy performance for us.'

He added: 'We did well as a team and we took our chances. We caught them on the break with speed and Dan got two great goals so I'm really delighted.'

Arsenal new boy Welbeck notched his first international goals for more than a year, first tapping home after an exquisite ball across the box from Raheem Sterling, before showing great composure and awareness to calmly slot past stranded Swiss keeper Yann Sommer in the dying moments.

The former Manchester United forward felt that his goals were ultimately just rewards for the work ethic shown by England.

'I think we created a number of chances which maybe we could have done better with the final pass. Once we got the first goal I think we were in control and played a good team game today and you could see the work ethic - everyone is playing for each other and that's very important,' he said.

The 23-year-old could not hide his delight after scoring his fine second goal, but was quick to praise those who worked hard to provide him with the opportunity.

'Obviously we've sat back a little bit deeper and we've got the pace to get in behind them so once they went Raz (Sterling) took the ball down the wing, played it into Rickie (Lambert) and then I knew he had the ability to slide me in and thankfully he did that,' he added.

'My first touch was nice and it was a nice finish.'
