A couple have been charged with murder after a grandfather was found shot in the head inside his burning truck.

Cleate Davis, 50, was allegedly robbed and left for dead by Aleasha Cox, 34, and Morrieo Allen as he sat in his Ford pick-up in Millington, Tennessee, on December 18. 

Police discovered the burning vehicle in a ditch at the side of the road with Davis'  charred body still inside.

The pair, who reportedly knew Davis, are believed to have shot him twice in the face during a robbery gone wrong. 

His grieving family said his death came just days after they discovered he had beaten cancer for the second time.

Authorities said that Allen was seen running from the scene and was arrested and detained two days later following a manhunt.

Cox was caught a short time later and has already admitted her part in the murder, according to My Fox Memphis.

His daughter, Rachel Davis, told the station that she still has one Christmas gift left to unwrap, the one from her grandfather.

She is now trying to figure out how to explain what has happened to his two granddaughters, aged just two and six. He had bought one of them a bike for Christmas and never got to watch them open it.

'I mean how do you tell a two-year old that grandpa's not here anymore?' she said. 'That was her hero, and she loves her grandpa more than anything.'

Davis' other daughter Rochelle Weber said: 'We're just still kind of shell-shocked about it. We're glad that both of them are in custody now.'

The pair made their first court appearance on Monday morning and were read their rights before they were returned to custody. 

Their family claim they both knew Davis and how 'kindhearted' he was.
