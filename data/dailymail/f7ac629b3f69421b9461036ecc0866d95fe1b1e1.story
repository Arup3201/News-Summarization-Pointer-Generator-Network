Healthy appetite: Mad Men Actress January Jones came under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills

When it comes to dishing out advise on health and wellbeing, maybe celebrities should just stick to their day jobs.

From Simon Cowell carrying around inhalable bottles of oxygen to tackle tiredness and stress, to actress Patsy Palmer rubbing coffee granules into her skin to prevent cellulite, stars are more prone than most to questionable fads.

Now scientists are hitting back and debunking the outlandish claims which are often lapped up by the public.

In a report, the charity Sense About Science has named and shamed actors, singers and sports personalities guilty of peddling 'dubious' scientific theories.

They also list five 'misleading' terms celebrities should avoid in 2013 as they mean very little - immune boosting, detox, superfood, oxygenating and cleansing.

And in an Olympic year, one of 2012's most popular fads was seen adorning the legs, backs and buttocks of athletes - coloured sports tape.

Footballer Mario Balotelli, tennis players Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, and British sprinter Dwain Chambers all used the Kinesio strapping, which comes in a variety of shades, to help with injuries.

Developed by a Japanese doctor more than 30 years ago, the adhesive tape is designed to provide muscle and joint support without restricting movement.

But sports scientist Professor Greg Whyte said: 'The manufacturers...claim placement of the tape on the skin reduces pain and swelling in injured muscles. It's unclear how this can positively affect inflammation deep within the muscle.' He added: 'That said. This tape could have added placebo effect'.

In 2011, Simon Cowell championed vitamin injections, but this year the media mogul has opted for pocket-sized oxygen shots to get his health fix.

According to reports, Cowell - also an aficionado of botox - is convinced inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness, stress and ageing.

Kay Mitchell, from the centre for 
Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, warned 'breathing pure 
oxygen can cause collapse of lung air sacs - this could make you more 
susceptible to lung infections'.

You can trust Simon Cowell to discover the Next Big Thing in showbusiness, but when it comes to reliable health advice perhaps one should look elsewhere.

The X-Factor supremo, who last year championed vitamin injections, apparently carries small bottles of oxygen with him convinced that inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness, stress and ageing.

Actress Patsy Palmer's home-made cure 
for cellulite involves rubbing coffee granules into her skin.

But pharmaceutical scientist Dr 
Gary Moss is not convinced. He says that while 'caffeine may have an effect, the coffee 
granules won't....for any chance of seeing an effect from such a small 
amount of caffeine you would need to be rubbing coffee into your skin 
all day.'

The 
Manchester City striker is one of many sportsmen to use Kinesio 
strapping, developed by a Japanese doctor  to provide muscle and joint 
support without restricting movement.

The tape, which comes in a range of colours is supposed to help with injuries. Scientists however remain unconvinced with a common view being that the tape might have, at best, a placebo effect.

The US actress apparently believes that children would better understand where their emotions come from  if they were taught about the functions of the brain.But in a scathing put down, neuroscientist Professor Sergo Della Sala said such an idea would work be no more effective than 'understanding the chemical components of a ball would help them to kick it better'.

Earlier this year, US star Sheryl Crow claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain tumour.The Soak Up The Sun singer said she used to spend  hours chatting away on 'archaic old cell phones.'But Dr Mireille Toledano from Imperial College London said: 'The evidence to date is clear that short term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer'.

Cowell
also featured in the report for announcing on Twitter that he had 
'someone heal me house. Strange but great. The healer brings in good 
energy'.

Star of Mad Men January Jones came 
under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills, 
following the birth of her son.

Catherine Collins, principal dietician at St George's Hospital, said: 'Nutritionally, there's little to be gained from eating your placenta - raw, cooked or dried.'

Earlier this year, singer Sheryl Crowe claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain tumour, saying 'I do have a theory that it's possible that it's related to that, I used to spend hours on the archaic old cell phones.'

But Dr Mireille Toledano from 
Imperial College London said: 'The evidence to date is clear that short 
term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer'.

Sense About Science also took 
exception to chancellor George Osborne saying the Government was giving 
the economy '110 per cent' of its attention.

Nigel
Hawkes, the former director of straight statists, said: 'You can't have
110 per cent of anything....it's nonsense to anybody with any feeling 
for numbers.'

Helpful contribution: Singer Gary Kemp said he was a pragmatic cynic and believer in 'hardcore medicine and science'

The 
charity did congratulate a handful of celebrities for making a helpful 
contribution and 'talking sense' on food fads, vitamin supplements and 
alternative therapies.

Singer Gary Kemp was praised for his comments in the Daily Mail last month debunking alternative medicine.

The former Spandau Ballet frontman said: 'I've tried acupuncture...but I'm a pragmatic cynic and believe hardcore medicine and science should be your first port of call before you deviate to other things, otherwise your life could be at risk.'

Science writer Simon Singh said it is 'right to highlight the value of "hardcore" medicine, which simply means that the treatment has been tested and shown to be effective.'

Cricketer Stuart Broad was also commended after telling the Daily Mail that food supplements are mostly superfluous, saying 'you can get enough out of your diet'.

Tracey Brown, the managing director of Sense About Science said: 'We seem to be seeing a celebrity divide on science.

The implausible and frankly dangerous claims about how to avoid cancer, improve skin or lose weight are becoming ever more ridiculous.

On the other hand, this year we have had more examples than ever sent to us of people in the public eye who clearly do check their facts.'
