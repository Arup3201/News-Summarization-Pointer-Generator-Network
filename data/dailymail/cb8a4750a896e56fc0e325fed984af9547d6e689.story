Everything was in place for England to
 suffer another embarrassment to begin their new era in the cold and wet
 of Aberdeen on Friday but they did all they had to do to take one small
 step towards recovery from their winter horrors. 

It
 would have been easy for England to push for an abandonment to avoid 
any chance of more suffering when rain delayed a fixture that was always
 likely to be weather-affected.

Yet
 one thing they will not lack under Peter Moores is enthusiasm and they 
made sure the 6,000 crowd who had waited all day at least got something 
of a game, even batting on during heavy rain when play eventually got 
under way at 4pm.

Job done: James Tredwell took four wickets as England beat Scotland by 39 runs in Aberdeen

‘It would have been wrong if the game hadn’t taken place,’ said England captain Alastair Cook. ‘It was as wet as I’ve ever fielded in and it probably wasn’t fit to play but both sides got on with it.’

England wore a strip that was virtually orange in their ill-fated World Twenty20 match against Holland and now, seemingly with a nod to their hosts, they took to the Mannofield outfield in near identical blue to Scotland. The chances of their faces becoming red were increased when rain reduced the match to 23 and then 20 overs after Scotland had won what looked an important toss.

Yet England, who will meet Scotland in different circumstances at next year’s World Cup, encouragingly passed this test of their mettle.

Fresh start: Captain Cook and Ian Bell come out to open the innings for England

England would not usually entrust the 
start of a Twenty20 innings to Cook and Ian Bell and the longer-form 
openers had to work hard for their runs in the gloom and in the face of 
what Cook hailed as ‘outstanding’ Scottish fielding. Bell was added to 
England’s squad for their Twenty20 matches against West Indies in March 
and the world tournament without playing a game but here he showed that 
class usually prevails across all forms of the game.

While Cook had 
trouble timing his strokes, Bell raced to 50 off 34 balls with two sixes
 and it will be interesting to see whether England include him for the 
sole short-form match against World Twenty20 champions Sri Lanka for the
 match at the Kia Oval on May 20.

Bell’s launchpad would have led to a
 bigger England score than their eventual 167 for six had their attempts
 to accelerate not been punctured by outstanding catches which accounted
 for Cook, Jos Buttler and Joe Root.

Contribution: The England captain scored 44 before being dismissed by Rob Taylor

Half-century: Ian Bell scored 50 to help England along to 167 from their 20 overs

Somerset’s Josh Davey, one of 
six county players in the Scotland side, was the pick of the home 
bowlers with three prime wickets but England, so woeful with the bat in 
the winter, will be satisfied with this opening gambit.

Once Jimmy 
Anderson had struck in the first over England’s latest banana skin was 
close to being avoided and Scotland fell 40 short of their revised 
target of 173 despite some fine hitting from Michael Leask, who has 
given up his job in an Aberdeen bank to concentrate of cricket.

Another
 couple of overs of Leask, who hit 42 off 16 balls, and things could 
have been very different but Anderson took a fine catch in the deep to 
give James Tredwell one of his four victims. This does not mean England 
are back but at least it’s a start.

Leap: Taylor catches Jos Buttler on the boundary to dismiss the England batsman for nine

Strike: Jimmy Anderson struck twice early to dismiss Matty Cross and Calum MacLeod (above)

Emerging talent: England's Harry Gurney runs in to bowl at Mannofield Park

Scene: The rain during the early part of the day cleared up, allowing the teams to play a 20-over contest

Low five: Tredwell celebrates with Eoin Morgan after picking up one of his four wickets

Through the gate: Scotland's Preston Mommsen is clean bowled in Aberdeen
