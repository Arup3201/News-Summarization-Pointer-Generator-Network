Many people working in the service industry often depend on their tips but that didn't stop this brazen thief from stealing the tip jar from staff at a coffee shop.

The thief was captured on CCTV waiting for the barista to become distracted while preparing a coffee before casually leaning over the counter and grabbing the tip jar.

The man, wearing dark sunglasses, a white shirt and black trousers, then places the tip jar in his bag before calmly walking out of the cafe.

Waiting for the perfect moment: The man wearing sunglasses, a white shirt and black trousers can be seen watching the member of staff at Coffee Angel in Dublin

Brazen: He can then be seen to casually elan over towards the counter to grab the tip jar while making sure the barista doesn't turn around

The CCTV footage from the cafe in Dublin was uploaded on to YouTube earlier this week and has already been view more than 100,000 times - with many condemning his actions.

Manager of Coffee Angel, Karl Purdy hopes making the video public may help track down the culprit of the theft at 3.45pm on Wednesday.

He told the Herald: 'I was really shocked when the staff asked me to look back at the footage and see what had happened. I'm sure tip jars go missing in cafes and restaurants all over the world, but it was the fact that he did it so openly and brazenly. 

Fraud: The man's hand clasps around the tip jar while he pretends he's talking on his mobile phone

Crafty: The thief then takes the tip jar off the counter without disturbing the member of staff nearby

Prepared: The tip jar thief then places the metal container in to a black bag he has ready

'I wasn't going to go to the gardai about it because the amount of change in the jar was small, but we have got a very sympathetic reaction from the public and just want this guy caught.'

But it appears this may not be the first time the tip jar thief has struck.

Mr Purdy continued: 'Since we put the footage up online other coffee shops have tweeted that they have had similar thefts happen.

'The tips jar is for when customers want to show some appreciation to the staff, and while it is not a big amount of money, it is the principle of the matter that is important.' 

Escape: The thief then casually walks out of the cafe in Dublin without the staff member or customer having realised what had happened

Appeal: The manager of Coffee Angel Karl Purdy put the CCTV footage on YouTube to help catch the culprit after several other stores reported tip jar thefts
