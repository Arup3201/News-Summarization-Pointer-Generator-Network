New reports revealing rampant sexting among FBI employees using government issued phones have forced the agency to publicly address the issue, downplaying any difference between federal agents and their civilian counterparts.

The bureau has been battling what its 
assistant chief branded a 'rash of sexting,' and has vowed to stamp it out after a leaked internal report said agents were exchanging lewd messages while they were supposed to be fighting crime.

'The instances described are not unlike those that occur among 
employees of any other large agency or organization in the country,' said a 
spokesperson for the FBI Office of Public Affairs. 'It is important to note that in an organization of more than
36,000 employees, these disciplinary incidents involve a fraction of 
one percent of FBI employees.'

The unidentified spokesperson, speaking to NBC News, said the disciplinary reports were 'provided to employees in a transparent effort to educate our workforce 
about the FBI's standards of conduct and to aid employees in steering 
clear of ethical pitfalls and other violations.'

So by showing exactly what the penalties for such behavior are, the agency is hoping agents will be led by example.

'When you are given an FBI 
BlackBerry, it's for official use. It's not to text the woman in another
office who you found attractive or to send a picture of yourself in a 
state of undress. That is not why we provide you an FBI BlackBerry,' FBI assistant director 
Candice Will told CNN this week.

The lurid details were revealed in confidential internal disciplinary report circulated to FBI employees as a way to reign in misconduct.

'We're hoping (that) getting the 
message out in the quarterlies is going to teach people, as well as 
their supervisors ... you can't do this stuff,' Ms Will added.

From 2010 to 2012, the FBI disciplined 1,045 workers for a variety of transgressions, according to the agency. Eighty-five were sacked.

The revelations include:

'Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity': More than 1,000 agents are struggling to keep up with the bureau motto

Others include an agent caught drink 
driving for the second time, another who used a lost or stolen credit 
card to buy petrol and another who was arrested for downloading child 
pornography.

The 
revelations are the result of a long-running investigation by CNN, which
has uncovered a catalogue of other misdemeanors by FBI officials in the
past few years.

In 2011, CNN first revealed a list of demeanors committed by agents.

Among the toughest punishments was for the agent who had the 
seven-month sexual relationship with a source. He was suspended for 40 
days.

Another employee drunkenly ‘exploited his FBI 
employment’ at a strip club by falsely claiming he was conducting an 
official investigation.
He was suspended for 30 days.

In another case a supervisor 
who viewed pornography in his office during work hours, while 'sexually 
satisfying himself' (so the file states) got a 35-day suspension.

And
an employee in a ‘leadership position’ misused a government database to
check on two friends who were exotic dancers and allowed them into an 
FBI office after hours was ordered to stay away from work for 23 days.

However, the FBI Association's Konrad Motyka was keen to point out that the  vast majority of the FBI's 36,000 employees act professionally, adding: 'It is important to note that the ratio of disciplinary issues among FBI
agents are among the lowest in the federal government and private 
sector.'
