An aid worker may have been forced to hang himself by his Syrian jailers, his inquest heard today.

Dr Abbas Shah Khan, 32, was found dead in his cell days before the Syrian government claimed he would be freed.

The surgeon - on a humanitarian mission to war-torn Aleppo - had been held  for nearly a year at the time of his death in December last year.

The medic  had entered Syria illegally after crossing over the Turkish border, the inquest heard.

His family made ‘super-human’ efforts to secure his release, with his mother Fatima, travelling to Damascus to negotiate.

Despite being in good spirits and looking forward to his imminent release, Dr Khan was found hanged in his central Damascus jail days before his planned release.

William Hague, then Foreign Secretary, rejected the Syrian government’s explanation of suicide, saying the humanitarian was ‘effectively murdered’.

Today, a jury of four women and seven men were sworn to examine the circumstances surrounding the death.

Chief Coroner Peter Thorton QC told them: ‘Dr Abbas Khan died in custody in Syria on 16 December 2013, aged 32.

‘In this country, he was a qualified doctor and surgeon, working for the NHS.

‘Although his death was in Damascus in Syria, under our law an inquest must be held into his death.’

The coroner said ‘no organisation or government is on trial’.

‘He was found dead, allegedly hanged, in prison in Damascus on December 16 last year.’

The coroner said Dr Khan’s trip had been ‘risky’.

‘It had dangers. The Foreign Office's clear and firm advice is do not travel to Syria.

‘There is no evidence that Dr Khan went to Syria to fight.’ 

The coroner said the main issues for the jury to consider after hearing all the evidence were likely to be - did Dr Khan take his own life, or was he 'forced in some way by his captors to take his own life against his will', or was he 'unlawfully killed' by his captors. 

The inquest heard from Dr Khan’s mother Fatima, who undertook a perilous solo mission to Damascus in a bid to free her son. 

She told the jury that in July last year she went to Syria to rescue her son and visited a number of embassies, ministries and prisons to try to find out where he was.

Some of the buildings she went to were shaken by bomb blasts and vans she travelled in came under sniper fire.

'I felt scared, but my son was here so I had to be brave.'

She would kiss the shoes of the officials she met and beg them to help her.

At the end of that month, she saw her son at the Court of Terrorism.

'I hugged him. He was a skeleton. He was in tears. I said, "Look, mummy is here for you". He said, "Sorry, I shouldn't have come here, please take me home".

'His hands were cold as if he was fasting. They were full of black marks and one nail was missing as if someone had taken it off. His feet were completely burnt.

'I said, "What's all this?". He said, "This is nothing, I have suffered more than this".'

She said she threw herself at the judge's feet and begged for mercy but he said there were allegations against her son, who was taken away in chains and then transferred to a civilian prison.

Mrs Khan said that when she visited him there at the end of August, he said the conditions were much better.

He said the previous prison was 'like Hell' with seven prisoners sharing an eight feet square cell 24 hours a day.

'He said it was like being in a living grave with only one tiny hole high up on the wall and with cockroaches, mice, urine and faeces on the floor.'

He said he was beaten up by other inmates and interrogated by five men who beat him with rubber hoses, leaving him with open wounds which became infected.

He said he had seen guards beating a 12-year-old boy who was crying for his mother and had seen a prisoner kicked and beaten to death.

After that, she spoke to him on the phone every day and visited him a dozen times between September and November, taking food and medicines - which he shared with other prisoners - while still putting pressure on every ministry in Damascus to obtain his release. 

The inquest continues.
