Shelley Bezanson, 28, of Osprey, Florida, is accused of purposefully killing pit bull-mix, Diamond, after the dog's vet refused to euthanize him

A woman has been charged with animal cruelty after police claim she strangled her healthy seven-year-old dog to death with its leash.

Shelley Bezanson, 28, of Osprey, Florida, is accused of purposefully killing pit bull-mix, Diamond, after the dog's vet refused to euthanize him.

According to a police report, the dog died a ‘prolonged, painful and cruel death’.

During October and November of 2013, 
police said Bezanson called her vet multiple times 
seeking to euthanize Diamond because he was, she insisted, ‘sick and 
old’.

The vet
 refused, because Diamond was healthy, and suggested Bezanson take him 
to the humane society if she didn’t want him.

Instead Bezanson choose to take matters into her own hands and end her poor pet’s life.

On
 Nov. 14, she allegedly strangled Diamond using his leash and even 
turned up the music in her apartment so her neighbors wouldn’t hear his screams.

A tip led Venice Police Department investigators to Bezanson, who tried to bury the animal at her mother's Venice home.

She apparently told investigators: ‘I promised Diamond we would be together until the end, and this was the end.’

Beranson also told police that she would
 have been evicted if she did not get rid of Diamond, but did not want 
anyone else to have the dog, reports the Herald Tribune.

She was arrested and charged with animal cruelty on Friday. She is being held at the Sarasota County Jail on $25,000 bond.

Sarasota County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Wendy Rose called the incident a ‘horrible story - particularly when you have so many willing rescue groups to help take the dog and give it a forever home.’

Bezanson also owned a kitten and a domesticated rat when she was arrested. In an interview with police, she allegedly added that she plans to adopt another dog.
