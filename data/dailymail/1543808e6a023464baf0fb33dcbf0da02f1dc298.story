Nearly 28 years since two teenage sisters vanished without a trace, their family is still searching for them - and has now turned to Facebook in a bid for answers.

Rozlin Abell was 18 when she left her home in Bethany, Oklahoma on July 25, 1985 saying she was going to look for jobs with her 15-year-old sister Fawn in tow.

Their brother Otto remembers the girls heading for the door, with one shouting: 'Hurry up. They're waiting for us down the street' - and it was the last words he ever heard them speak.

There have been no leads into their 
disappearances but the family has not given up; they have now turned to 
social media and have ploaded artists' renditions of what the girls would look like today.

No trace: Fifteen-year-old Fawn Abell, left, and her 18-year-old sister Rozlin, right, have been missing since July 25, 1985, when they went to look for jobs, and investigators have no leads in the case

The pictures of the women, who would now be 46 and 43, are splashed across the family's Facebook group, which has gathered 1,000 supporters since it was set up by a family friend.

'To this day we still don't know what happened to them,' their brother, Otto Abell, told News 9. 'It keeps you up at night and you just go on and on about different things. It's been this long, I'm pretty sure something bad happened to them.'

No trace of the girls has been found since they disappeared in the middle of the day that July.

A missing persons report was only 
placed for Fawn as she was a juvenile at the time, and Lt. Austin 
Warfield, who is investigating the case, told NewsOK she was listed as a runaway for some time.

But the girls' families are certain 
there was foul play involved as they often hitchhiked, and asked investigators to see if any bones
found in the area matched the girls, but they have not.

DNA swabs have been taken from Otto Abell and his mother, but so far they have not matched up with any unclaimed human remains at labs in the country, Warfield said.

There has also been no activity on Rozlin Abell's Social Security number since July 
1985. She was eventually listed as a missing person when her parents said they had not heard from her.

'We don't know if the girls are still
alive,' Warfield said. 'We don't know if any human remains of the girls
have been found and not identified yet, and we don't know if the 
remains are somewhere in a field.'

The family does not know what jobs the 
girls were going to look at that day and did not know where they were 
going. But they were known to hitchhike around the area.

Warfield added that it is unlikely that the sisters would contact their family now if they are still alive.

Michelle Caudle, who knew the girls and believes they were snatched, started the Facebook page.

'Rozlin was tiny, but she had an attitude, a temper,' Caudle told NewsOk. Fawn was more mellow.'

She said that some people have sent her messages saying they thought they had seen the women, but the tips turned up nothing.

Both girls were blonde-haired and small:
Rozlin was 4-foot-11 and weighed about 90 pounds at the time of her 
disappearance, while Fawn was 5-foot-1 and weighed around 100 pounds.
