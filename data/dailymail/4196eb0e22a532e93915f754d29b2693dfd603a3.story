It is one of the smallest self-governing territories in the world and is home to just 30,000 people but that hasn't prevented Gibraltar from launching its own beauty pageant.

Indeed, Miss Gibraltar has been running since 1959 when Viola Abudarham took the title and, in 2009, spawned the winner of Miss World in the (perfectly formed) shape of Kaiane Aldorino.

Now James Neish, 39, one of the organisers of the 2014 edition, has revealed what working on one of the world's smallest beauty pageants is really like.

Mr Neish, who appears on Channel 5's Gibraltar: Britain in the Sun tonight, has been involved with the competition since 2003 and says it is one of the highlights of the British Overseas Territory's social calendar.

Nevertheless, with a tiny pool of candidates to choose from - and an even smaller selection of judges - he says making it happen isn't always easy. 

'All pageants come with their challenges,' he admits. 'It’s really important to remain fair and impartial so we ask the Ministry of Culture to fly judges in from abroad.

'In such a small community it would be impossible to recruit judges who didn't know at least one of the contestants.'

Finding enough candidates can also prove challenging, with the Territory's small population limiting the pool - particularly as British women and those from neighbouring Spain aren't allowed in unless they live permanently in Gibraltar.

Despite the challenges, Mr Neath says he loves working on the show which he describes as a 'big social occasion' and a cross between Sunday Night at the Palladium and Britain's Next Top Model.

But, says Mr Neath, for the girls to emerge triumphant, they're going to need more than a pretty face and fabulous figure.

'Confidence, personality and I think, above all, coming across as genuine are important factors,' he explains.

'A good performance  - in short, someone who has taken direction from the producers and then delivered on stage  - is also important.

Winning ways:  Gibraltar has produced one Miss World winner, although neighbouring Spain has had none

'Gibraltarian women generally have a real charm and a Mediterranean feel about them. Even so, it's not just about looks.'

Good looks notwithstanding, Mr Neath also says there's more to becoming a beauty queen - in Gibraltar at least - than turning up at photo shoots. 

'The pageant has to reflect much more than just physical beauty,' he says, passionately. 'Talent, personality and, most importantly, charity work are all taken into account.

'Indeed, for the past few years, we have asked each contestant to represent a charity [on stage], which has been an enriching experience for everyone.

'Normally none, or very few, of the young women who embark on the Miss Gibraltar journey have done public speaking before.

'When you see them stand in front of hundreds - knowing thousands are watching at home  - and they  passionately talk about their charities, it is proof that beauty queens really can make a difference and matter for much more than their looks.'

Nevertheless, the man from the tiny territory that has produced as many Miss World winners as France, Finland and Israel - and more than neighbouring Spain which has had none - says looks are one of the reasons for his country's success.

'Are Gibraltarian women among the world’s most beautiful?' he says. 'That’s an easy one! Yes, yes, yes!'

Not only did Britain invent Miss World, it has won it more times than any other nation barring one - Venezuela.

British beauties won the title in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1974 and 1983, although recent years have proved less fruitful.

Nevertheless, British winners have triumphed on more occasions than almost anyone else, with India taking third place on the winner's podium behind the UK and Venezuela and the US in fourth.

Other countries to enjoy multiple wins include Sweden, Iceland, China, Russia and Australia, all of which have won twice or three times.

Along with Gibraltar, one-off winners include Germany, Egypt, Finland, France and Brazil, as well as Israel and the Philippines.

Despite being home to approximately 46 million people, neighbouring Spain - which dwarfs tiny Gibraltar - has never managed to produce a winner.
