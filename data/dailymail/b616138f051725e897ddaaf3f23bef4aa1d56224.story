A man from Oregon shot his wife two days before Thanksgiving, after learning she was having an affair with his brother. He then turned the gun on himself but failed to kill himself.

Raymond Johnson, 38, shot himself in the chest after learning of the devastating news that his wife, Rebekah Johnson, 32, was seeing his brother on the side.

The shooting took place outside the couples home in Oregon City. 

Troubled times: Raymond Joseph Johnson allegedly shot dead his wife Rebekah Johnson in the driveway of their Oregon home after he found out she had been having an affair with his brother for six months 

Mrs Johnson, 32, died in hospital the next day. Mr Johnson is being held on bail at the Clackamas County Jail on a murder charge. A trial is scheduled for next year. 

Court documents show the couple's 17-year-old nephew found the couple laying wounded in their driveway.

The teen removed the .38 caliber Taurus revolver away from his uncle's hand and took out the ammunition.

The couple's two young children, aged five and seven, were inside the home when the shooting happened.

Warning signs? Raymond Johnson's father died two days before the shooting and family members had noticed that he had been 'behaving strangely'

Oregon Live say that the family had been undergoing a turbulent time after Raymond Johnson's father died two days before the shooting.

During the days following the death it became known that Mr Johnson's brother was sleeping with his wife and had been having an affair for six months but the family only got know of the details on the day of the shooting.

Mrs Johnson and the nephew discovered a handgun was missing from the gun safe soon after returning to the couple's home, 

After going outside to speak with her husband she was shot in the front yard.

According to the affidavit the nephew was in an upstairs bedroom when he heard the commotion outside. 

He heard his aunt yell, 'No,' before a gunshot rang out. 

Seconds later, a second gunshot occurred and Mr Johnson fell to the ground.

Neighborhood shock: Police seized eight rifles and backpack with ammunition, as well as the revolver, from the Johnsons' home

In the months prior to the deadly shooting, it had been noticed that Mr Johnson had been 'behaving strangely'.

Family members had put it down to the fact he was on constant pain medication after a car accident last year and the after-effects of a brain tumor from when he was 20.  

Police seized eight rifles and backpack with ammunition, as well as the revolver, from the Johnsons' home, according to the search warrant. Raymond Johnson also had bullets in his pants pockets.

The incident was one of four fatal shootings involving married couples in Clackamas County since November.

Mr Johnson is now in jail awaiting his murder trial which will take place in January 2016.
