A Californian user of Microsoft's Hotmail service has received thousand of blank emails after a glitch in Google's service automatically inserted his email address into new messages.

The glitch is believed to be related to a bug that caused Google's hugely popular email service to be unavailable to some users this afternoon.

Google says the problem has now been fixed - but admitted it did not know what had happened.

This latest glitch is believed to be separate from a bug that caused email addresses to be accidentally added to messages. Last week, a Californian user of Microsoft's Hotmail service received thousand of blank emails after a glitch in Google's service automatically inserted his email address into new messages

Rival Yahoo tweeted its users several times to tell them google's service was down.

Marissa Mayer's firm immediately came under fire online for jumping of a rival's technical problems.

However, less than an hour later, the tweets were deleted.

Yahoo then issued an apology, telling its users 'Earlier today, a tweet that reflected bad judgment was posted and has been deleted. We apologize to @Google and the @Gmail team'

David Peck, of Fresno, said most of the emails are blank.

'I’ve been getting thousands of no-subject, blank emails,' he told TechCrunch.

'500 of them come every hour, I can’t stop them.'

'They’re coming so fast, I want to stop them. I deleted everything last night and woke up this morning and had 1,900 new emails' he said.

'Only two of them were emails I cared about'.

The glitch is believed to be related to an outage which affected Google users today.

hundreds took to Twitter to complain after being unable to use the service using the hashtag #whengmailwasdown - and rival yahoo even tweeted about it.

At 2:12pm Google acknowledged the problem, telling users 'We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more information shortly.'

Poor taste: Marissa Mayer's Yahoo tweeted about the Google outage, before being forced to delete the tweet and apologise.

Many Gmail users complained they were either locked out of their accounts, couldn't access the service, or were missing emails, at the end of last week. Some took to Twitter to complain. Rival Yahoo tweeted about the outage, before later apologising, pictured

At 3:14, it added 'Gmail service has already been restored for some users, and we expect a resolution for all users in the near future. Please note this time frame is an estimate and may change.'

By 3:23, it claimed the service had been fixed.

'The problem with Gmail should be resolved. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and continued support. Please rest assured that system reliability is a top priority at Google, and we are making continuous improvements to make our systems better.'
