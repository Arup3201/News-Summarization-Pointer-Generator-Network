Confession: David Redmond has allegedly admitted to killing his own baby son because the infant irritated him

A 24-year-old Washington state father has been charged with first degree murder after admitting throwing his 'fussy' newborn baby nine-feet across a room, causing the child fatal brain damage.

Vancouver man David Redmond told police he abused his one-month-old son Everett every day of his short life and came home on the evening of October 15 and lost his temper with the baby, tossing him at the child's changing table.

'I threw him pretty hard,' said Redmond to detectives when he admitted the murder of the six-pound baby, police papers reveal. 'I was pretty annoyed.'

Redmond appeared in Clark County Superior Court on Monday in a green suicide prevention vest and the judge announced he was being held on $750,000 bail ahead of his next court appearance on October 23.

During his solemn court appearance, a police affidavit was read out that detailed the horrifying abuse dished out by the violent father.

'David said he was frustrated with this, so he dropped Everett onto his changing table, causing Everett to bump his head on the wooden rail,' wrote Vancoucer police detetive Jason Hafer.

Hafer wrote. 'Everett paused for a second with his mouth open, then started crying a high-pitched noise.'

According to the Columbian newspaper, Redmond's wife Ashley was not home at the time.

She gave birth to Everett premature and underdeveloped at three pounds and 14 ounces.

Wracked with guilt, Redmond went to check on his son later during the night and found him to be unresponsive.

Panicked, he woke his wife and told her their son was not breathing properly and they called 911.

The baby was rushed to Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland, but was diagnosed as brain dead shortly after arrival.

Doctors observed the child's injuries and asked the couple, who married in May, 2013, what happened.

Redmond lied and said that earlier in the day he was napping with the baby and accidentally rolled over onto him.

Subsequent scans revealed Everett had a huge skull fracture, soft tissue swelling and bleeding inside the brain that caused his eyes to hemorrhage appalling.

Doctors initially feared 'shaken baby syndrome' but when the full extent of the child's injuries were revealed they informed police that they had been caused by blunt-force trauma.

Confronted by officers, Redmond allegedly confessed and told police he had abused his son every day since his birth.

On one occasion he held his own son's jaw shut to stop him crying and threw him around the room when his infant wailing irritated him.

He also admiited to spanking the child when Everett was one week old.

Police told the court that Redmond is depressed according to the Columbian.

'We believe the defendant has mental issues,' said Deputy Prosecutor Patrick Robinson. 'He had indicated he wants to die.'

Redmond's mother, Jenifer, took to Facebook to express her shock.

'We had a horrific tragedy happen,' wrote Jenifer Redmond.

'Our son out of exhaustion hurt our baby grandson. The baby died. Our son is not (the) monster that the news station and papers would like you to believe.'

Redmond also has a tatoo on his right shoulder that references the Bible, 2 Chronicles 7:14 - according to the Columbian.

'If then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land,' the scripture says.
