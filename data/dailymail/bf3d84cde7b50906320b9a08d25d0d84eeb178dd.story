A Republican lawmaker resigned after his wife sent a ‘racist’ email to the Democratic campaign team of Olympics star Carl Lewis, it's been revealed.

New Jersey politician Pat Delany, 42, stepped down from the state assembly this month because of the ‘offensive’ email, a GOP official said.

It was sent by Jennifer Delany to the state Senate campaign team of political novice Mr Lewis, 50, who is a nine-time Olympic gold medallist.

Mr Delany had originally cited an unspecified family issue as the reason for his abrupt resignation earlier this month.

But Burlington County Republican Chairman Bill Layton revealed it was because he wanted to save his children from embarrassment.

The email said in part: ‘Imagine having dark skin and name recognition and the nerve to think that equalled knowing something about politics.’

Mr Layton said the father-of-three decided to leave office to shield his children from ‘a hurtful and embarrassing public spectacle’.

He described her email, which was in response to a routine mailing from Mr Lewis’s campaign, as ‘inexplicable’ and ‘inexcusable’.

Mr Delany put forward his ‘sincere apologies’ to Mr Lewis on behalf of his family but said he does not share the same racial views as his wife.

Mr Delany holds a physics degree from Rutgers University and served in the U.S. Navy for eight years, the New Jersey Legislature website says.

He was in the job for less than eight months and his wife was a Burlington County committeewoman at the time of the email, reported NJ.com.

Mr Lewis is running for state Senate in a New Jersey Legislative District. Mr Delany was part of the opposing GOP Assembly slate in the district.

The ex-athlete and Republicans have been 
fighting over whether he meets the state's four-year residency 
requirement for state Senate candidates.

He grew up in Willingboro, a 
middle-class town between Philadelphia and Trenton, but recently has 
lived in California, where he owns a home.

He went to Texas for college and in 1984 moved from track star to celebrity when he won four gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics.

Over the next 12 years, he would collect five more golds at the Olympics.

New Jersey's top elections official, Republican Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, ruled Mr Lewis ineligible to run for office this spring.

Mr Lewis, who is among the greatest athletes of all time, challenged the ruling in federal and state courts.

A federal appeals court allowed his name to appear on June primary ballots, and he won his party's nomination with 2,418 votes in an uncontested race.

Republican Senator Dawn Addiego won her uncontested party primary with 4,350 votes, and the two would face off in November - if the courts allow.

Mr Lewis contends he moved back to New Jersey in 2005, when he bought homes for himself and his mother.

He has been a volunteer high school track coach since 2007 and has had a valid New Jersey driver's licence since 2006.

However, records show that he voted in California through 2009, which Republicans contend made him a legal resident of that state.

Mr Lewis exhausted his appeals in state court when the New Jersey Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

The issue before the federal court is whether the state's residency requirement for state Senate candidates violates the 14th Amendment.

This is over an equal protection clause as applied to him.

Mr Lewis, who has not commented on the email, contends that he knows the issues facing the district and that voters know who he is.
