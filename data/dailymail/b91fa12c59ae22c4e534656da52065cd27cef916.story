Everton are considering a bid for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis after Romelu Lukaku injured his ankle against Liverpool on Tuesday night.

The influential Belgian has damaged his ligaments and faces three to four weeks on the sidelines.

They need another strike option as Lacina Traore is still some way off with his hamstring injury and Arouna Kone is out for most of the season.

France centre forward Gomis is a long-time target of Newcastle but they grew tired of negotiating for the 28-year-old and have switched their attention to midfield and Clement Grenier to replace Yohan Cabaye. Lyon need the money but Gomis is out of contract in the summer and ready to leave after enduring a strained relationship with the club.

Everton ideally want younger players but, if Lyon can be tempted with a bid of around £3million, they may be able to reach an agreement.

Manager Roberto Martinez also remains keen to bring in another defensive midfielder on loan from abroad. He had designs on Gueida Fofana from Lyon but they are not prepared to deal with Grenier’s pending move and Arsenal considering Yoan Gourcuff as an alternative to other plans.

West Bromwich Albion are looking at a diverse set of targets as they look to replace Shane Long.

Chief scout Stuart White watched Leeds United against Leicester at the weekend and was at Burnley against Brighton on Tuesday night.

In demand: West Brom and Sunderland are among the clubs interested in Ross McCormack

Ross McCormack is understood to be the object of his attention on Saturday while Burnley’s Danny Ings was the target at Turf Moor.

They have made an enquiry for Valencia’s 29-year-old forward Jonas but, as West Ham found out earlier this month, he will struggle to gain a work permit as he does not have a dual passport and has not played the necessary games for Brazil.

Albion have also asked about Espanyol’s Thievy Bifouma, as have Leicester City, while QPR target Ishak Belfodil of Inter Milan has been offered on loan, as has former Manchester City striker Rolando Bianchi, now 30 and at Torino.

Belfodil was in the stands at Loftus Road on Tuesday night. His deal there has fallen through over terms of a proposed permanent deal but he is open to joining an English club until May.

Albion have a large squad and could still take offers for Nicolas Anelka while Markus Rosenberg is still expected to join Malmo. Offers have been made from Turkish sides for Diego Lugano but Pepe Mel sees the Uruguayan as someone who can help get his message across to the other players and he will stay.

Midfielder George Thorne is likely to join Derby County on loan later on Wednesday.

West Ham have been criticised by the sporting director of La Liga club Osasuna over the proposed transfer of Raoul Loe that failed to materialise last week.

The Hammers had moved to sign the Cameroon defensive midfielder but backed out at the last minute after becoming aware that they could definitely sign Antonio Nocerino from AC Milan. It left 24-year-old Loe ‘sorely disappointed’.

Vasiljevic said: ‘I cannot understand how a club at that level can negotiate and work in a two-faced way like that. Raoul had a bad Saturday night.’

West Ham believe it was more misleading information from the agents involved but there will be a few more upset players like that this week as clubs and agents adopt an almost scatter-gun approach across Europe.

Wigan fear they will miss out on Hull City’s Jack Hobbs as Nottingham Forest seem to be in pole position. Leicester are also lurking with Fulham poised to bid again for the injured Liam Moore but Hull manager Steve Bruce said: ‘I would expect Jack to go. We have accepted a bid from Forest, we have accepted a bid from Wigan and we have accepted a bid from Reading, so I would expect him by Friday to take up one of those options.’

With that in mind, Wigan have considered Bolton target Craig Dawson as a loan from West Brom but are now leaning towards a move for former New York Red Bulls defender Markus Holgersson.

The 28-year-old Swedish man is a free agent after failing to take up a new deal at Red Bulls for the new season.

Sunderland have also expressed an interest in Ross McCormack. Manager Gus Poyet has been offered deals for Tomane from Guimaraes and Valencia winger Andres Guardado but is reluctant to bring in too many more foreign players.

He remains keen on bringing in Liam Bridcutt from Brighton which may entail Connor Wickham going the other way.

Losing McCormack would be a blow to Leeds and manager Brian McDermott. West Ham are unlikely now to make a renewed bid but West Brom have watched him too.

McDermott fears the 27-year-old may be sold as Leeds’ prospective new owners continue to jostle for position.

The Italian consortium led by Cagliari’s Massimo Cellino were not seen at Elland Road on Tuesday night despite being expected. Their move on Leeds is being heralded in Italy as a chance for Cagliari playmaker Andrea Tabanelli to move to Yorkshire on loan for the rest of the season.

That news has not gone down too well with some playing staff, who fear more Italians could follow if that buy-out goes through.
