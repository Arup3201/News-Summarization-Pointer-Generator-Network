Dynamo Kiev responded to last week's 2-1 loss at Guingamp with a 3-1 home victory but their triumph was overshadowed by crowd trouble.

The tie was halted 15 minutes before the end with the Ukrainians leading by two goals and going through - so the home fans decided to cause trouble.

Dynamo goalkeeper Olexandr Shovkovskiy took it upon himself to try and calm the crowd with a place in the last 16 just a quarter of an hour away.

All five Italian sides progressed to the next round, with Torino, Napoli, Fiorentina and Inter Milan joining Roma.

Torino edged a ding-dong battle with Athletic Bilbao 3-2 on the night and 5-4 on aggregate.
