Sally Bercow was castigated for lacking ‘common sense’ as she finally apologised for libelling Lord McAlpine yesterday.

The Speaker’s wife issued a grovelling apology to the Tory peer at the High Court to draw a line under her comments on Twitter.

The 43-year-old agreed to pay £15,000 in damages, which will be donated to the Chelsea Pensioners, and has been left with a six-figure legal bill.

The court ruled that if she returned to Twitter – having deactivated her account during proceedings – she must apologise.

She
 did so yesterday, posting: ‘I have apologised sincerely to Lord 
McAlpine in court – I hope others have learned tweeting can inflict real
 harm on people’s lives.’

Lord McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid, said the prolonged litigation had left Mrs Bercow ‘substantially out of pocket’.

He
 also accused her of damaging the health of Lord McAlpine, 71, by 
prolonging the matter. The libel arose following a BBC Newsnight 
programme last November over the abuse of young boys at care homes in 
Wales. It alleged that ‘a leading Conservative politician from the 
Thatcher years’ had been involved.

As speculation raged over his identity, Mrs Bercow posted on Twitter: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’

The
 allegation was without foundation and Lord McAlpine announced that he 
would pursue those who libelled him. The peer agreed a £185,000 
settlement with the BBC and £125,000 with ITV.

But Mrs Bercow insisted that her Tweet was not defamatory and her lawyer described it as a ‘random thought’.

However,
 the High Court ruled against her in May, after Lord McAlpine’s lawyers 
said it clearly ‘pointed the finger of blame’ at him. The judges agreed,
 saying the message provided her online followers with ‘the last piece 
of the jigsaw’ in identifying the peer.

The
 settlement was agreed at court yesterday, with Mrs Bercow apologising. 
Speaking on her behalf, William McCormick QC, said: ‘Mrs Bercow 
withdraws the allegation she made on Twitter unreservedly, and apologies
 sincerely to Lord McAlpine for the great damage and distress which her 
tweeting caused him.

‘Mrs
 Bercow wishes and hopes that as a result of this matter other Twitter 
users will behave more responsibly in how they use that platform. She 
certainly intends to do so herself.’

Lord
 McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid, said his client offered to settle in
 January ‘in an attempt to avoid the detrimental effect of litigation on
 his health’.

However, Mrs Bercow ‘was not prepared at the relevant time to avail herself of this reasonable offer’.

‘Our
 client had never wanted the situation to get to this stage,’ said Mr 
Reid. ‘This litigation could have been avoided if common sense had 
prevailed over political positioning.’
