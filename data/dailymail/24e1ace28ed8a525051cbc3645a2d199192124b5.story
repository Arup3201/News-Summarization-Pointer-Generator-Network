A Wisconsin couple who got stranded in snow near Yellowstone National Park for six days have spoken of how they wrote farewell letters to their loved ones the night before they were rescued after fearing that they were never going to be found alive.

Tourists Mark and Kristine Wathke of Cornell, Wisconsin, were found 'cold and hungry' but uninjured on Monday morning after their ordeal on the Beartooth Highway in Wyoming.

The couple say the navigation app on their phone advised them to take the highway, which had been shut since September. They said they didn't see any closure signs.

‘Seeing our family and friends again, that's what kept us alive out there.’ Christine Wathke told ABC. ‘I wrote to them what they meant to me. And just letting them know that I loved them.’

During their ordeal the couple started their car periodically 
to stay warm and at night piled all there clothes on top of them to stay warm. 

They survived by rationing the tiny amount of food they had with them and were down to just eight pieces of 
bread and half a tank of gas when help finally arrived.

The couple were finally found by Troy Barnett, the owner of a guest ranch in Cody, who took his snowmobile to out search for the couple 
after he heard reports they were missing.

The couple were last seen leaving the northeast entrance of Yellowstone at 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, October 29. They had hotel reservations in Miles City that night, but never arrived.

The car was stuck in the snow along the Beartooth Highway, which had been posted as closed since mid-September due to hazardous driving conditions.

‘We never saw any road closed signs. We never saw any barricades,' said Kristine Wathke.

The couple's family had last heard from them on Oct 29 when they
were still within Yellowstone.

The couple had told there family they 
would be home the following day, but then there was no further cell 
phone activity.

Ordeal: The Wathkes survived on food they had bought for the trip including bread, peanut butter, jelly, a package of cookies and a box of instant oatmeal

While the weather had been warm in the park and it wasn't until they had traveled 35 miles that the snow began to fall and the drifts got bigger.

By the time they tried to turn back, at 5pm, their car got stuck.

They survived on food they had bought 
for the trip - bread, peanut butter, jelly, a package of cookies and a 
box of instant oatmeal.

But as the days wore on and they had still not 
managed to dig the car out of the drifts, they began to lose hope. 

On
November 2, the night before they were found, they decided to write 
goodbye notes to their loved ones and make a recording giving their 
farewells.

As temperatures dropped to minus seven, a water bottle the couple had with them froze solid, the Billings Gazette reports.

Search 
and Rescue personnel used vehicles and aircraft to look for the 
couple’s silver 2012 Kia Forte.

'Residents in this 
area often volunteer their time and resources to assist in rescue 
operations,' Park County Sheriff Scott Steward told the Chippena Herald.

'Barnett’s actions in this instance possibly saved this couple from serious harm. I commend him for his unselfishness.'

The missing poster had been circulated and posted on the Yellowstone Visitor Facebook page to report the couple's disappearance
