Leaning over police crime scene tape, I’m peering into what was once a kennel. There is no roof, and the floor is covered with blackened material. The acrid smell is horrendous. Among the rubble are dog collars, a tennis ball and several chew toys.

When the Manchester Dogs’ Home was set on fire on September 11, killing 60 dogs in the adoption unit, my feeling was that there really is no hope for mankind.

On my visit to what is left of the home I meet Sandy, a staffie who was one of only two dogs pulled alive from the burned-down wing. She had come to the home five months before as a stray.

Rescued: Liz with staffie Sandy, one of only two dogs from a unit within the Manchester Dogs Home to have survived the blaze

Though only about five or six years old, she has obviously already had several litters, perhaps bred for dog-fighting. She was in the adoption unit as she was deemed ready to be rehomed. Once pulled from the fire, Sandy was rushed to the home’s sister site in Cheshire and placed in intensive care. She remains on medication for the effects of smoke inhalation and has nightmares.

Anna Stansfield, manager of the site, says: ‘I hear her crying and groaning in her sleep, and she paddles with her paws. She has been very depressed.’

The other survivor, two-year-old Badger, has already been rehomed. A lovely dark lurcher with white paws, he was adopted by a local family, the Corfields, who got a bit carried away and took two other dogs home too.

Badger’s only legacy from the fire is a cough and an abscess, and a propensity to sleep a lot. Fourteen-year-old Maddie Corfield took Badger to school to help raise awareness for the home, and to show classmates how a rescue dog can be more rewarding than purchasing a pedigree.

Donations from the public have now reached £1.4 million, which means the damaged wing can be demolished this week, and a bigger, better kennel built to rescue many more dogs. But much more needs to be done in an area where hundreds of dogs wander the streets, and the local rescue centres are full to brimming. Stepping into the fray are a task force of eight women who, in their own words ‘like to make things happen’.

Destroyed: The adoption unit after the fire at the home. Donations from the public towards the home have now topped £1.4million 

They are Michala Hulme, 32, a historian; Sue Wright, 46, a barrister and wife of former England footballer Mark Wright; Victoria Atkin, 32, a manager at Balfour Beatty; businesswoman Diana Bowden, 41; Lesley Grimes, 50, a company director; Louise Lessells, 58 a charity executive; Helen Pritchard, 35, a social media agency owner; and Alice Gibson, a 27-year-old PR professional. Michala tells me: ‘I rescued a German pointer from the home eight years ago, and sadly he died recently. I went back to the home to sponsor a kennel five days before the fire. I’d never met the other women before, but we got together in the days after the fire.’

We are at historic Tatton Park in Cheshire, where the task force is orchestrating a calendar shoot with rescue dogs past and present. The star of the show, as Miss January, is undoubtedly Sandy, but owners who have had many years of love and companionship from former Manchester Dogs’ Home inmates have been keen to step up to the mark and allow their dogs to take part. They include comedian John Bishop, who has a rescued English bull terrier, Billy,

John says: ‘Billy came to us in October 2007 and is the third dog we have had from the dogs’ home. I would never go to a breeder, there are so many lovely dogs looking for homes.’

It’s hoped the calendar, which we preview here, will raise thousands more to help with the rebuild. 

Calendar photographer Colin Boulter is donating his time. He says: ‘I grew up in a council house round the back of the dogs’ home, and always went to sleep to the sound of barking.

‘The local area, Harpurhey, gets a negative press, but the fact locals turned up, spontaneously, to help when the fire broke out says it all.’

Meeting the task force women and kennel workers has gone a long way towards restoring my faith in human nature, especially when the home’s manager Steve Mapley tells me: ‘People are still bringing along dog beds they whipped from under their own pets. Some still feel warm!’

The calendar is available from November 17 at dogshome.net, £7.99.
