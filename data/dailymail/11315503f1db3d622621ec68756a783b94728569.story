It turns out people aren't the only ones who like kissing as these smooching lizards show.

The pair of amorous reptiles were spotted by a family visiting the Henri Pittier National Park in Venezuela.

Mother-of-two Mariana Ramos de la Rosa was exploring the rainforest which, at 5,900 feet metres above sea level, is the highest point in the South American country.

The 48-year-old fine arts student said: 'At the time I wasn't wearing my glasses and there wasn't much I could see.

'But I saw this beautiful and bright blue turquoise in the distance and prepared my camera and took two shots and showed them to my son.

'I thought there was only one lizard and to my surprise my son told me, 'mum it's not one, there are two and they are kissing!'.

'I took another shot but the female had disappeared and the male was looking all over the place for her.'

The blue and green lizards are also known as Rainbow Whiptails and are found in Central and South America and some Caribbean Islands.

They have a streamlined body, a pointed head, a slightly forked tongue and females usually lay their eggs between March and December.

The Rainbow Whiptail lizard is a popular pet and enjoys feeding on crickets and mealworms

They can grow up to 12 inches and can live up to four years.

Their striking colouring makes them a popular exotic pet.

Because they are fast and agile, a large aquarium, at least 75 gallons, is advised to house them in.

Typically the lizards like to bask in the sun, so a sunning area should be provided at 110F.
