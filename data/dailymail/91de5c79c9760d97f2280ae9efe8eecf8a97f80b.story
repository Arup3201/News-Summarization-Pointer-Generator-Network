A Manhattan business executive is facing a sexual harassment lawsuit after his former receptionist accused him of fondling her breasts and forcing her to accompany him to the restroom.

The suit filed by Sherina Thomas, 28, seeks unspecified damages from the defendant, 41-year-old David Shavolian who heads the company Executive Offices New York City offering high-end business suites for rent.

According to court filings made public this week, Miss Thomas, who is engaged to be married with  two young kids, first met Shavolian last year when she answered an ad placed by Executive Offices seeking child models.

Plaintiff: Sherina Thomas, 28, (pictured) filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, Manhattan real estate executive David Shavolian

Thomas, a mother of two, had spent a year working for Executive Offices New York City, during which time she claims her boss offered her money for oral sex and forced her to accompany him to the men's room

However, when the woman arrived at the company’s headquarters on Seventh Avenue, Shavolian allegedly started making sexual advances at her.

The lawsuit cited by the New York Daily News states that the 41-year-old businessman offered Thomas to help launch her own modeling career.

He then allegedly forced her to show him her bare breasts, which he then proceeded to fondle before declaring that they were 'not firm enough.'

After that first encounter, Mr Shavolian called Thomas and offered her a job as a receptionist in his company.

The mother of two, who was unemployed at the time, came in for an interview, which has been described in court filings as anything but typical.

According to the suit, at one point Shavolian inquired of Thomas, 'do you shave or wax?'

Despite the apparent red flags, the cash-strapped Thomas decided to take the job in May 2012.

A promotion to a managerial position soon followed, but her rapid career growth was accompanied by some unconventional job requirements, among them shadowing her boss wherever he went - even to the men's room.

The lawsuit claims the high-powered executive also propositioned his employee, even offering her $1,200 for oral sex.

After working for Shavolian for a year, Thomas resigned this past May.
