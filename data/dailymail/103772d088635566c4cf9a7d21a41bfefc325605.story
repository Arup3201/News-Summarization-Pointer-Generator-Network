A father with throat cancer who is about to permanently lose his voice will still be able to speak to his family – and dog, Daisy – thanks to an iPad.

Ray Rodda, 61, from Sunderland, has been diagnosed with throat cancer and is having his voice box completely removed - leaving him unable to make a sound.

The retired graphic designer is determined he won't be silenced and has recorded around a dozen messages for his family, including his kids and wife Shirley, 52.

Commands: Mr Rodda has even left instructions for his beloved dog, Daisy (pictured), on the iPad

But Mr Rodda has also made commands for his beloved pet golden labrador Daisy - including sit, heel, lie down, high five and dance.

The messages, recorded onto an iPad, will mean even after his voice has gone he'll be able to play with his dog - and say hello and 'I love you' to his family.

Daughter Emma, 24, said: 'After the operation he won't be able to say anything or make any noise.

'He had been given the iPad by the NHS and will be able to type in it like a text message and it will speak the words.

'But that will be in a different computer voice and he was worried that the dog wouldn't listen to him or know who was talking.

'It seems like a little thing, but to be able to record his own voice makes a real difference.

'My dad has never complained about anything through all this and I don't think he has really thought about how life-changing this will be at the moment.

'He is just looking forward to the surgery because he is suffering so much.'

Mr Rodda, a retired graphic designer, visited doctors last year with a persistent sore throat, but was initially told it was high blood pressure and then an infection.

But after three visits doctors found a tumour and despite intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy the disease spread to his tongue and lymph nodes.

Mr Rodda was put on six weeks of daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy in December, which failed to eliminate the cancer.

The father-of-three is set to have a complex 13-hour operation to remove his voice box, tongue and the glands in his throat.

Three weeks ago his family were told the best chance he has of beating the disease is having the huge operation, which he is due to have today.

After the operation at Sunderland Royal Hospital he will breathe through a tracheotomy, be fed through a tube connected to his stomach and will speak using the iPad.

Upbeat: Mr Rodda's daughter, Emma (pictured), said that he is doing his best to be positive about his plight

Sit down, Daisy

High five, Daisy

Show me want you want, Daisy

I love you

Heel, Daisy

Lie down, Daisy

Dance, Daisy

Hi Andrew

Hi Emma

Hi Shirl

Hi Mum

Hi Alison 

Wife Shirley, a special educational needs teacher, is also teaching him symbols and gestures to help him communicate.

Emma, who is engaged to partner Andrew Howells, 30, said: 'When you say to my dad about it he says 'what's the alternative?'

'It is such a difficult time for us but at the end of the day, we are pleased that there is another option. He is just looking forward to getting rid of the pain.

'He is upbeat about it and even jokes. When his doctor was asking how he might feel about something or other he joked 'well, you won't hear a peep out of me about it'.

'With the recorded messages he will be able to tell Daisy all the tricks he has taught her like 'Heel Daisy', 'Lie down Daisy', 'Dance Daisy', just simple things.

'He will also be able to say 'Hi Andrew' to my fiance, 'Hi Shirl' to my mum, 'Hi Mum' to his mother-in-law and 'Hi Alison' to my sister.'

The family is hoping that the operation will save Mr Rodda’s life.

Emma added: 'The doctors say that it doesn't look like it has gone anywhere else, but it did go to his lymph nodes.

'The hope is that the surgery will remove all of the cancer. Hopefully this will work.'

Emma is fundraising for the Northern Centre for Cancer Care in Newcastle where Ray had his treatment. To donate visit: www.justgiving.com/Roddas-Radiotherapy.
