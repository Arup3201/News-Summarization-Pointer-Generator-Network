A senior Sun reporter walked free from court yesterday after being cleared of illegally paying a public official.

Nick Parker, 53, was acquitted of aiding and abetting Surrey police officer Alan Tierney, 42, to commit misconduct in a public office.

It was alleged Parker paid him for stories in 2009, including a tip-off that Chelsea footballer John Terry’s mother had been caught shoplifting.

Cleared: Nick Parker, 53, was acquitted of aiding and abetting Surrey police officer Alan Tierney, 42, to commit misconduct in a public office. But the jury did find him guilty of handling stolen goods

But the chief foreign correspondent was found guilty of handling stolen goods, after provisionally agreeing to pay £10,000 for a Labour MP’s mobile phone, and handed a three-month suspended sentence.

The Old Bailey heard he went through dozens of texts and emails on the phone belonging to Siobhain McDonagh – then a whip in Gordon Brown’s government.

She had received messages about the Miliband brothers as they battled for the Labour leadership, including one that said: ‘I will kill myself if Ed wins.’

Parker, from London, had claimed he had no idea the phone had been stolen when he looked through it in 2010.

Acquitted: Former Whitehall editor Clodagh Hartley was cleared of illegally paying for Budget leaks

Michael Ankers, 30, who snatched the phone from Miss McDonagh’s car, was jailed for six months for theft.

The thief, who is currently in prison for drug dealing, demanded £10,000 from The Sun for the phone.

But Parker found nothing newsworthy enough for publication and handed it in to police the next day.

The verdict comes two weeks after another Sun reporter was acquitted of corrupting a public official.

Clodagh Hartley, 40, was cleared of illegally paying £17,000 for leaks from the Budget in 2010, after telling jurors she was trying to expose political spin.
