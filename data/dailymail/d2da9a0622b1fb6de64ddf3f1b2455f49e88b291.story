A mother found dead in a burning car is thought to have started the blaze which claimed her life and that of her son.

Detectives investigating the deaths believe the bodies found close to a yacht club in Southend-on-Sea yesterday are those of Catherine Mhlaba, 45, and 16-year-old Beki Ali.

Officers are looking at the possibility that Mrs Mhlaba started the fire in her black Vauxhall Vectra, with the aim of ending her life and killing her son - who had global delay, a condition which meant he had the mental age of a six-year-old.

Witnesses described seeing the car roll forwards as if it were being driven before it suddenly burst into flames.

Blaze: A mother and child found dead in a burning car in Southend-on-Sea, Essex have been named as Catherine Mhlaba and Beki Ali

Horror: Witnesses saw the car suddenly explode near a yacht club in an upmarket area of town

Firefighters were called to the scene in the upmarket Thorpe Bay neighbourhood, and took 30 minutes to extinguish the blaze.

When police arrived around 5.30pm, they found the bodies inside the vehicle.

The street where the pair were found, which houses and yacht and tennis club, has been cordoned off while investigations into the incident continue.

Mrs Mhlaba and her son - who have not been formally identified - originally came from Zimbabwe, and were living in Shoeburyness at the time of their death.

According to members of the local Zimbabwean community, the woman's father helped found the Movement for Democratic Change, the main political party opposed to president Robert Mugabe.

Investigation: Police are investigating the possibility that Mrs Mhlaba started the fire which claimed her life and that of her 16-year-old son

Audrey Charowa, 34, an MDC activist from Basildon, said Mrs Mhlaba's family are 'shattered' at the news.

She said: 'It is very shocking and we are all devastated.

'As you would expect the family are pretty shattered and have been talking to the police all day.

'We will now be paying tribute as an MDC. Obviously the whole Zimbabwean community is in deep shock. It was totally unexpected.'

Writing on a Zimbabwean news website, 
Mrs Charowa described the woman as a 'heroine' and said that the 
community was in mourning after her death.

One eyewitness, Mandie Cotton, was approaching the car when it exploded as she was out on a run.

Her
boyfriend Paul Smith said: 'The car was rolling at the time, in a 
normal driving position, before it exploded and she didn't know whether 
someone had got out of the car when a fire had started.

'She was only 25 or 50 yards away from the car when it exploded so she was pretty shaken. She said it was really frightening.'

Appeal: Police have asked witnesses to contact them to help them find out what happened

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this very difficult time.

'These tragic deaths are being investigated by detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate.

'Their
investigation is currently looking at the possibility that Catherine 
Mhlaba was responsible for killing her son and taking her own life by 
starting the fire inside the car.

'Detectives are appealing for anyone with information to contact them at Southend on 101.

'They
are particularly keen to hear from a dog walker who may have been in 
the area at about 5.20pm or anyone who may have seen the car at any time
either before or during the fire.

'Police are aware some people may 
have taken moving footage or images on mobile devices at the time and 
would ask for these to be made available to detectives.'

Formal identification is expected to take several weeks.

An Essex Fire and Rescue Service spokesman confirmed they attended the car fire and used two hose reel jets to extinguish the flames.
