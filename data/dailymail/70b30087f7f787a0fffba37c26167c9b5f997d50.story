It’s amazing just how much entertainment you can get from squeezing and smooshing silly putty. 

But what happens when you add an active ingredient in silly putty to another staple of children’s playtime - sand?

That’s exactly what a company called Delta of Sweden wanted to find out with their latest invention, DeltaSand, according to Rain Noe of Core 77.

DeltaSand, also marketed as Kinetic Sand, claims to be three-dimensional building toy that holds its shape just as easily as it tumbles through a child¿s fingers

Sand, claims to be three-dimensional building toy that holds its shape 
just as easily as it tumbles through a child’s fingers.

You can sculpt intricate designs by cutting through it, squeezing it, and spreading it. 

Or you can just as easily break it up as you would sand on a beach.

The company says it achieves this double-act using 98 per cent sand and a ‘patented technology hidden within the binder’.

This led one YouTube user, Jose Antonio Chacón, to comment that it was ’98 per cent sand, two per cent deadly chemical compounds.’ 

Core 77, however, has done some digging in the medical fact sheet and found two tell-tale ingredients in its list; silicon dioxide and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS).

‘So is it safe? It better be: PDMS, a silicone agent found in caulk, can also be used as an antifoaming agent,’  said Core 77's Rain Noe.

The same ingredient, added Noe, is listed by McDonald’s and Wendy’s in its chicken nuggets.

While £12 for a 1kg bag of sand may seem steep, we suspect the addictive combination of sand and silly putty means you won't want to put it down.
