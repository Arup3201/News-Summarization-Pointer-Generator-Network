A British defence contractor was amongst the targets of the world’s largest ever cyber attack, thought to have been carried out by China.

Hackers tried to infiltrate the unidentified company to find out sensitive military secrets during an unprecedented five year worldwide campaign, according to a report.

A total of 72 national governments and well known companies along with bodies such as the International Olympic Committee all fell victim to the operation.

Hacked: The United Nations building in New York. The UN was one of 72 organisations infiltrated by the biggest cyber attack in history

Experts said the most probable 
culprit was the Chinese government which has recently been blamed for 
cyber campaigns against the International Monetary Fund and Sony.

The scale of the operation - which 
covered 14 countries - has stunned American computer security company 
McAfee, which discovered it.

‘This is the biggest transfer of 
wealth in terms of intellectual property in history. The scale at which 
this is occurring is really, really frightening,’ Dmitri Alperovitch, 
the security company’s vice president of threat research said.

‘Even we were surprised by the 
enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by 
the audacity of the perpetrators’.

McAfee dubbed the hacking ‘Operation 
Shady RAT’, or remote access tool, referring to a kind of computer 
software used to infiltrate networks.

In addition to the British defence 
contractor, a computer security company from the UK was also hit but 
neither have been identified.

Amongst the other victims which have 
publicly been named are the World Anti-doping Agency, the United 
Nations, the Associated Press news agency and ASEAN, the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nation which counts Singapore amongst its members.

The U.S. was hacked the most - 49 
times - followed by Canada four times and South Korea three times. 
Britain was affected twice. The data stolen included e-mail archives, 
design schematics, legal contracts and government secrets.

Long infiltration: In the case of the UN, the hackers broke into the computer system of its secretariat in Geneva in 2008, hid there for nearly two years, and quietly combed through reams of secret data

McAfee said the hacking dates back to the middle of 2006 although there may still be intrusions which it has not yet detected.

The attacks lasted from a matter of 
weeks to a sustained 28-month attack against an Olympic committee of an 
unidentified Asian nation.

The operation worked by sending an 
e-mail which when opened downloaded a malicious programme onto an 
individual’s computer which allowed an intruder to gain access to their 
network and remove data.

McAfee learned of the operation last 
March when it gained access to one of the hackers’ servers and began 
notifying companies which had been affected and working with them to 
improve their security systems.

James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert 
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was 
only one country that could be responsible for the attack.

‘The most likely candidate is China,’ he said. ‘Who else spies on Taiwan?’

China has long been suspected as being the world’s leader in cyber espionage.

Mr Lewis added: ‘Everything points to
China. It could be the Russians, but there is more that points to China
than Russia’.              

There was no comment from China on the report. 

Britain’s Ministry of Defence, one of the prime targets, was alone the victim of more than 1,000 cyber attacks last year.

Last year, cyber crime cost the 
British economy £21billion according to one industry report, but it is 
widely accepted that the figure could be much higher.

In 2009, a foreign intelligence 
agency infiltrated the Pentagon’s £200billion Joint Strike Fighter 
project, the U.S. defence department’s costliest weapons programme in 
history.

Cyber spies stole data relating to 
the aircraft’s design and electronic system. Officials said the attacks 
appeared to originate from China.

Google, the Pentagon, Chinese dissidents, and the oil industry has also been hit.

Earlier this year it emerged the IMF 
was the victim of a ‘very major’ cyber attack in which it could have 
lost extremely sensitive data on the finances of dozens of nations.

Mr Alperovitch declined to name the 
companies which were targeted and would only go so far as to blame a 
‘nation state’ for the operation.

d ‘What is happening to all this data … is still largely an open question.

‘However, if even a fraction of it is
used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key 
negotiation he loss represents a massive economic threat.

‘Companies and government agencies 
are getting raped and pillaged every day. They are losing economic 
advantage and national secrets to unscrupulous competitors.’

International Olympic Committee 
communications director Mark Adams said that if the allegations of 
hacking were true they would be ‘disturbing’.
