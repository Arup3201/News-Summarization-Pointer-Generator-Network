A senior Afghan commander who has advised the Prime Minister has warned that withdrawing British troops from Afghanistan will spark a ‘global jihad’.

The damaging comments come on the day David Cameron hosts a high-profile summit at Chequers to discuss plans to combat the Taliban and other terrorist threats after American and British troops pull out next year.

But in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Colonel Amin Jan of the Afghan National Army (ANA) said that removing British forces from Afghanistan will allow Al Qaeda and the Taliban to seize power.

The officer also claimed that ANA troops are not good enough to defeat  the insurgents – a statement that is politically embarrassing for the Prime Minister, as these troops have been trained by UK mentors for the past three years. Britain’s exit strategy hinges on national forces being able to combat the Taliban. But Col Jan – the second most senior Afghan commander in Helmand province – accused politicians of making misleading assessments of Afghan troops’ capabilities to justify their  decision to accelerate the pull out of international forces. 

Tonight Mr Cameron will dine at  his country retreat with Pakistan President Asif Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, ahead of in-depth talks on the region’s security on Monday.

The Prime Minister has pledged to pull out all British troops next year, before the next Election. But already numbers are being cut back and bases in tactically crucial areas being closed down. 

When asked if 2014 was the right time for a handover, Col Jan said: ‘No, I would say that it is too early, because the situation will not have ended. If the British leave, the jihadists will see it as a good sign. A worldwide jihad will take place. That is my view.’

And when asked if the ANA could defeat the Taliban without international help, he said: ‘Our leaders might say we are able to do the task, but it will be difficult.

‘We have enough soldiers, we have the quantity, but we need  the quality. We need more  professional and better trained commanders.

‘Do the British want Afghanistan to return to being a Taliban state? That is the prospect.’

As recently as December, Mr Cameron praised the Afghan forces for their readiness to tackle the Taliban after the withdrawal. Addressing British troops in Camp Bastion, he said: ‘Frankly, the Afghan army is doing better than we expected, there’s more of them than we expected and that’s why we are able to bring home so many troops.’

Col Jan, 55, is the deputy commander of a brigade of 4,500 soldiers in Helmand, where fighting against the Taliban has been most intense. He is also respected for his resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the Eighties. He is in no doubt that pressure from the British public is the driving force behind the withdrawal of troops from Helmand, but warned: ‘People in Britain should consider what the future is for Afghanistan and the world.

‘Think about whether you would like Afghanistan to go back to being a Taliban state and a home for terrorism. Think about throwing away the progress made over the past ten years.

‘The biggest problem we have is to provide security in the most volatile areas of the country.’

Whatever his motivation for suggesting that his troops are incapable of resisting the insurgents, Col Jan’s comments contrast sharply with the official British line. 

Lieutenant Colonel Ben Wrench, commander of the British group which oversees the mentoring of Afghan troops in Helmand, told The Mail on Sunday that the enemy had been reduced to banditry and were no longer worthy of being called ‘insurgents’. ‘Back in 2010 we were holding the ANA’s hands and doing their planning,’ he said. ‘Now we are sitting right back. In terms of capability they are way past the tipping point and in another year’s time they will have the ability to manoeuvre all their troops and assets as one.

‘When we leave I would expect a stand-off, a power struggle, but with the Afghan security forces winning out. The enemy is fractured. They are more like bandits today. They are hardly an insurgency, to call them one is doing them a favour.’

Many other local commanders also praised the ANA, insisting the troops were successfully  conducting strike operations against Taliban strongholds with very limited UK support. 

However, Col Jan said that the Taliban would rise after the  British and international forces withdraw, aided by Afghanistan’s neighbours seeking to destabilise the country.

He said: ‘Pakistan is at the root of the problem. I know what is happening there because I live on the  border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan is training the Taliban over the border and giving homes to their commanders. The international community needs to put more pressure on Pakistan to stop this before it is too late. We know that Iran is involved as well.’

Col Jan has previously offered first-hand advice to British politicians. In 2011, he met Mr Cameron in Helmand, and a photograph of them deep in discussion hangs on his office wall at Camp Shorabak, next to Camp  Bastion, where thousands of local recruits go through basic training.

Last month Col Jan hosted a visit to Camp Shorabak by Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan. Afterwards, Mr Robathan said the transition to Afghan security was going ‘extremely well’. Col Jan has also visited the UK, most recently in December to take part in an exercise to strengthen the relationship between British and Afghan officers.

A British Government spokesman said last night: ‘Afghan forces are already responsible for more than 75 per cent of the population and by the end of 2014, Afghanistan will have a well-trained and capable national security force of over 300,000. 

‘The international community’s support for the Afghan Government won’t end with the withdrawal of troops at the end of 2014. Commitments will provide £2.5 billion a year for security until 2017 and £2.5 billion a year for development to help to underpin Afghanistan’s future stability. 

‘It is vital that the process is Afghan-led – this is what the Afghan people want.’

Gurkha troops based at Britain’s 
bloodiest outpost in Helmand province have handed control to Afghan 
police after finally securing peace there.

Patrol
 Base 4, in the province’s Nahr-e Bughra district, was once dubbed The 
Heart Of Darkness and has seen some of the campaign’s most intense 
fighting.

At least 12 
British soldiers have died there, including two soldiers who were 
killed, along with 17 injured, in a Taliban attack in 2009.

But last Thursday, base commander 
Major Shane Burton ceremonially removed the Gurkhas’ colours from above 
 a mud hut inside the compound.

PB4 was established as part of an 
advance in 2009 dubbed ‘Operation Panther’s Claw’.

According to Major 
Burton, 33, the peaceful situation today is in stark contrast to three 
years ago when his Gurkhas were shot at every day and tracks nearby were
 laced with deadly mines.

‘Back
 then, this place  was christened The Heart Of Darkness,’ he said. ‘If 
you asked me if I could have foreseen then where we are today, my honest
 answer would be no. The differences are stark.

‘During
 the six months we spent here in 2010, we suffered two fatalities, eight
 life-changing injuries and 17 lesser casualties.

'We returned to PB4 in 
2012 expecting as many IEDs [Improvised Explosive Devices]. But the 
tracks were clear and we haven’t lost any soldiers since.

‘Today,
 the enemy’s capability appears greatly reduced, families are returning,
 the people are happy and shops and schools have reopened.’

After
 three tours of Helmand province, Major Burton says  the improved 
capability of the Afghan national security forces has made the biggest 
difference to security. ‘We’re not holding their hands any more,’ he 
said.
