A woman who drowned in a sea cave during a storm was an adventure-loving teacher and former Royal Navy poster girl.

Charlotte Furness-Smith, 30, died after becoming trapped in a cave on the Dorset coast. Rescuers spent two hours communicating with her through a 15ft-deep cave blowhole, but could not reach her in time.

Yesterday family and friends paid tribute to the experienced climber, who was known as Buffy.

Miss Furness-Smith, who volunteered at
the London Olympics, was ‘coasteering’ with her brother Alex, 31, when 
she got into trouble in rough conditions a week ago.

The sport involves 
free climbing and swimming along rocky coastlines, and led to Miss 
Furness-Smith being swept into Tilly Whim caves.

Rescuers put their own lives at risk to get to her, but tragically ran out of time.

Her body could then not be recovered 
because of severe weather, and police are still searching for her 
remains, officially classing her as a missing person.

Yesterday Miss Furness-Smith’s 
parents, Patricia, 57, and Charles, 58, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, 
were said by a friend to be ‘shocked and deeply upset’ at their 
‘devastating loss’.

Miss Furness-Smith’s godfather Jon 
Coles said: ‘Buffy was a wonderful girl with an engaging personality and
a fabulous friend to all.

‘She was a dedicated and  vivacious teacher who loved the outdoor life.’

Miss Furness-Smith, whose photograph 
was used as a ‘stock image’ by the Royal Navy, was born in Trinidad and 
Tobago but her family moved to the UK when she was eight.

She joined the
Navy Reserves at Exeter University, where she graduated in engineering 
before qualifying as a maths teacher.

In her role in the Navy’s recruitment 
team she visited Downing Street and also volunteered to serve in the 
second Gulf war in 2008.

Two months ago she began a new job teaching 
maths at the Bristol Free School.

Family friend Mark Morgan described 
her as a ‘beautiful girl’. He added: ‘She was always happy, smiling and 
full of the joys of life.’

It is believed Miss Furness-Smith was 
dragged into the opening of the cave by fierce waves being whipped by 
50mph winds.

Two lifeboat crews battled against the force-nine gale to 
try to rescue her but were pushed back, while another team member risked
his own life to crawl down into the cave – but found her dead.

Dave Turnbull, of the Swanage 
lifeboat, said: ‘A coastguard officer entered through the blowhole but 
found the woman had sadly succumbed to the conditions.

‘It was very sad and a truly awful situation to have been in.’
