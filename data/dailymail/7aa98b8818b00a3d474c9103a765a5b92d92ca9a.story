The prestige of the FA Cup is under renewed threat after it emerged not one third-round match involving a Premier League team is likely to be played on Saturday, January 3.

Confirmation of the blow to FA Cup tradition came after BBC and BT Sport revealed that their total of five televised matches, all involving Premier League teams, would be staged on Sunday, Monday and — for the first time — Tuesday.

The FA have caved into demands from Premier League teams, who are playing a full set of fixtures on New Year’s Day, to play no earlier than the Sunday. The decision to bow to this pressure means only half the teams in the third-round draw will play on the Saturday.

Wimbledon's tie with Liverpool is sure to evoke memories of the famous 1988 FA Cup final

BBC will show the prestigious clash between AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool (Monday) plus Arsenal v Hull (Sunday). BT Sport will feature Dover v Crystal Palace (Sunday), Accrington or Yeovil v Manchester United (Sunday) and Everton v West Ham (Tuesday).

Chelsea’s clash with Watford at Stamford Bridge has also been moved to Sunday at 4pm.

It means the BBC’s flagship highlights programme Match of the Day on Saturday will probably not show a single team from the Premier League.

Blyth were one of the stories of the second round, and their third round tie could be first on Match of the Day

Manchester United's trip to Accrington Stanley or Yeovil Town will be shown live on BT Sport.

It will be the 43rd time in a row that United's tie will be shown, a record going back 10 years to a 0-0 draw with Exeter.

Blyth Spartans, who beat Hartlepool to reach the third round where they face Birmingham City, could be the first team shown on Match of the Day.

Other Premier League teams, who are already complaining of exhaustion ahead of the Christmas schedule, have until early next week to request a change from their original Saturday fixtures.

The FA are unlikely to stand in their way and have made it clear that they intend to take a pragmatic approach to Premier League teams who would prefer to play on Sunday.
