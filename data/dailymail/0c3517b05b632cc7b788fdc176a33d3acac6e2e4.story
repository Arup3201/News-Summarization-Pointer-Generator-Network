CLICK HERE to read about the battle facing Sky  to keep lions' share of Premier League TV broadcasting rights ahead of £4bn bidding war

Football, as we knew it, changed 23 years ago. The Premier League was born and Sky Sports would revolutionise television coverage of the best teams in the country. 

To mark the launch of the historic 1992-93 season, players from all 22 Premier League clubs (not the 20 we are now used to) posed for this memorable photograph. 

Among the stellar cast are a current national team head coach, a frontrunner for the newly-vacant Queens Park Rangers managerial position and someone who went on to become a star in action-packed Hollywood blockbusters... but can you name them?

SPOILER ALERT: NO CHEATING, ANSWERS ARE DIRECTLY BELOW THIS PICTURE 

Looking back to the start of the Premier League era in August 1992 and Snap! were riding high at the top of the charts with Rhythm Is A Dancer.

Also in the top five at that time was Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballe collaboration Barcelona, which became the soundtrack for the Olympics that year.

If you were going to cinema in August 1992 then the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven was the film at the top of the box office.

At the end of the first year of the Premier League it was Alex Ferguson's Manchester United who won their first title for 26 years. United eventually won the league by 10 points, but for much of the season were pushed all the way by Aston Villa and Norwich.
