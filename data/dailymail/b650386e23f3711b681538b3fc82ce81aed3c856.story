Britain's economy will experience the fastest growth in a decade in 2015 due to the slump in oil prices with household income expected to see a leap of 4%, according to economists.

In a forecast due to be published today, the EY Item Club predicts a growth of 2.9% this year - the highest since 2005 - with families likely to see their real incomes rise by almost 3.7%.

The numbers are significantly higher than the 2.4% prediction given by George Osborne in his autumn statement last year.

Economists predict the fastest growth in Britain's economy in ten years thanks to the slump in oil prices

The Item Club, whose predictions are based on the Treasury's economic model, says the fall in oil price is acting as the catalyst.

The forecast expects the price of crude to settle to between $40 and $60 a barrel, then recover, reported The Sunday Times. 

As well as oil prices tumbling, wholesale gas prices have fallen by a quarter in the past year and the price of coal has been falling for three years.

And yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron urged companies to pass on extra profits made from falling oil prices to their employees.

Mr Cameron said it was time for workers squeezed by years of austerity to get their reward. 

Speaking in Washington D.C., he told a press conference: 'Falling oil prices is going to benefit a lot of businesses and a lot of countries and we want to see those benefits passed through in all the ways they can be.'

President Barack Obama gave Mr Cameron a pre-election endorsement last night, praising Britain’s economic performance.

Suggesting Britain should stick to its economic course, Mr Obama said: ‘On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.’ 

Mr Cameron's comments followed the release of statistics which showed falling oil prices, and the economic recovery, have pushed many companies' profitability to a 16-year high.

But in response, Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of trying to 'magic away' families' money problems.

He said: 'Week after week, month after month, year after year, this Government has shown a tin ear for what is really going on. 

'They have denied the cost of living crisis. They have been woefully out of touch with the daily struggles of families. They have rubbished the idea that people are worse off.' 

He added: 'Five years of denial, complacency and failure on living standards, and less than four months before an election, he claims to have woken up to the problem.

'You can't wipe out five years of failure on living standards with pre-election pleading. You can't magic away people being £1,600 a year worse off by trying to take credit for falling oil prices.'

The Prime Minister, in Washington for talks with Barack Obama, said: 'Obviously I want to see companies' success passed through in terms of wage increases'
