There are growing fears of 'lone wolf' terrorists in Australia following a string of recent incidents involving individuals who were not on security watch lists, meaning the threat is often with 'the guy next door'.

The Sydney siege in December was conducted solely by gunman Man Monis. There have since been a string of arrests as police conduct terror raids across raids.  

On Tuesday, Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were the latest to be charged as they were allegedly preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in Sydney. 

Neither were on security watch-lists. 

However, a terrorism expert in Melbourne gave a warning four years ago of the growing threat from 'lone wolf' terrorists.

Noor Huda Ismail went to school with a number of the Bali bombers, and developed a program to de-radicalise jihadists returning to Indonesia.

He now lives in Melbourne and says would-be terrorists who are not connected to any command structure are almost impossible for security agencies to identify.  

Mr Ismail, who went to the Al-Mukmin Islamic boarding school in Solo, central Java, along with a number of the Bali bombers, says the arrests this week are further evidence the new breed of extremist is the 'guy next door'.

'This will be the difficulty of any security apparatus at the moment,' he said.

'This is clearly now the challenge. The biggest threat will come from people like that.'

Mr Ismail identified the growing the threat from so-called lone-wolf terrorists, and in 2011 contributed to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warning of the increasing number of 'freelancers' inspired by groups such as al-Qaeda.

In internet chatrooms, he says, these 'at risk' individuals will easily segue from conversations about 'hair gel' to talk about the 'latest beheading video'.

Mr Ismail says it's almost impossible for security agencies to identify such people before they act, and authorities must 'move away from looking at this as a security issue and focus on the demographic aspect of the threat'.

The comments come as details of the contents of a video allegedly made by Al-Kutobi and Kiad emerged on Thursday.

During Question Time in parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott gave a graphic description of the disturbing video. 

He explained that one of the men made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers', whilst 'kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him'.

Abbott informed parliament that the man on the video said: 'I swear to almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. 

'We only are you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.'

Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements

Mr Ismail says the language allegedly used in the video was undoubtedly aimed at 'glory for himself and to inspire others'. 

Mr Abbott made his comments while arguing that the parliament should pass the government's proposed further changes to data retention laws.

This comes after social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives on Wednesday revealed he was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery.

Pictures of Mohammad Kiad on his Facebook page show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces.

However in person, the 25-year-old nurse who worked as a removalist has been described as a quiet man who never mentioned his religion, according to Fairfax.

Both men  arrived in Australia from the Middle East seeking a better life as refugees but allegedly became radicalised in recent months, it has been claimed. 

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told the Today Show on Thursday Kiad, from Kuwait, and Al-Kutobi, from Iraq, were granted refugee status.

Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse after he arrived in Australia by plane in 2009. The Daily Telegraph alleges a senior intelligence source has confirmed he arrived in the country with false documentation. 

Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. 

A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported.

Pictures of the duo from mid-2013 show them poking faces and smoking shisha together. 

Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job.

While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September.

'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi.

'I heard them praying in [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. 

Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture she owned dumped in the rubbish bin.

'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said.

'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.'

Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege.

She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English.

She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them.

Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police. 

On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court.
