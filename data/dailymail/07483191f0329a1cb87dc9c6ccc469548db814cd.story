The body of an autistic 20-year-old who left his home 44 days ago and never returned has been found floating in a creek near a golf course.

Eagle Scout Brian Gewirtz told his family he was going for a walk near his Brooklyn, New York, home on February 17, but didn't come back. 

His family started a frantic search in the local community, warning people of his disability which made it hard for him to understand spoken language.

But police said Friday his body had been discovered at Marine Park Golf Club, just two miles from his home.

Laura Rivera, Brian's godmother, told ABC 7: 'He was so thoughtful, and if you were sad he would sit with you for hours just hugging you and saying I love you.

'He was over 18 yes, but he had the mind of a very much younger person because of his disability, and lots of people didn't understand that and there really needs to be a law just like an amber alert. 

Police suspect he wandered into Marine Park back in mid-February and got disoriented. The freezing temperatures at the time mean hypothermia could also have contributed to his death. 

A worker in the pro shop told The New York Post the body was found near the eight hole and came up with the tide.

Gewirtz’s family and friends offered a $5,000 reward if he was found alive.
