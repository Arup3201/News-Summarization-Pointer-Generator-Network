Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9

An elementary school teacher has been suspended after a Facebook post alleged that she instructed the students to re-enact the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The Brantley Elementary School teacher, who has not been named, allegedly made 11 and 12-year-old white students play police officers and research the death of Mike Brown - who was shot dead on August 9, sparking race riots.

Jessica Baughn, the mother of sixth grader Jimmy Griffin, who attends the school in Selma, Alabama, posted the complaint on Facebook on Tuesday. 

She wrote: 'I am absolutely shocked by what my 6th grade child come home telling me that [sic] happened in school (Brantley Elementary).

'His teacher made them reenact the two current shooting of the young black male's [sic].

'The white students had to play the police officer. She even has them get on the internet and research how many times the young man was shot where [and] he was shot at.'

Speaking to the Selma Times-Journal, Ms Baughn added: 'I don't think that it needs to be talked about at school at all, let alone reenacted.

'It scares me as a parent, because any one of those children could have picked up their aunt, uncle, grandma or whoever's gun and pointed it at another child and it went off accidentally.'

Dallas County Schools superintendent of education Don Willingham said an instructor was teaching about current affairs when someone mentioned the shooting in Ferguson.

He said the class conducted a 'skit' about the shooting, but declined to give further details of what happened or who suggested doing it.

Mr Willingham said he had since interviewed the school's principal, Audrey Larkin Strong, the teacher involved, Ms Baughn and her son.

Mr Willingham refused to identify the teacher involved until further interviews could be conducted, but has put the individual on paid leave.

'We wish the conversation didn't have to take place, but it's been reported to us and we're addressing it as quick as we can,' Mr Willingham said.

'I did put the teacher on administrative leave with pay, because we wanted to do the investigation. It's standard procedure.'

Mr Willingham said he would continue interview those involved again, as well as students who were present in the classroom.

Mr Strong said the school did not teach violence to children.

He said: 'Brantley's culture does not support division.

'We do recognize diversity, but we do not support division. Our culture is a strong culture.'

Riots continue in Ferguson, Missouri, following the unarmed black teenager's killing on August 9

Ten days and nights of street battles between protesters and police officers have followed Michael Brown's death, with tear gas and rubber bullets used by officers.

Overnight curfews have been ignored and shops have been looted by Ferguson residents who are infuriated by the shooting of the unarmed blacked teenager. 

The identity of the police officer who shot Brown was hidden for days, but after intense pressure was revealed to be Darren Wilson, who has since gone into hiding for his own safety.

Attorney General Eric Holder yesterday visited Ferguson to appeal for calm while he leads a 'fair' investigation.
