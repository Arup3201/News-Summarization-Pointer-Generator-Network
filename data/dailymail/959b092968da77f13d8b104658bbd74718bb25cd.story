It's a landscape picture so spectacularly beautiful many cynics will suspect it has come from computer photo-wizardry.

But the photographer who captured this stunning vista of the orange sun splashed gloriously across a mountaintop claims the amazing view was all natural.

Harry Lichtman saw the awe-inspiring scene during a sunrise over Grinnell Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, at the exact moment the peak was bathed in orange sunlight.

Mr Lichtman said a combination of the sun's warm glow, along with the reddish brown of Grinnell Peak's sedimentary rock, helped create the unique early morning landscape.

The 47-year-old also points out that evergreen trees in the left corner of the picture are also turning red at the sun-shade boundary.

And he insists that, although many may suspect otherwise, the incredible image did not receive any Photoshop treatment.

Mr Lichtman, from Newmarket, New Hampshire, said: 'The morning started out pretty stormy and cloudy, which can be magical, as in this case, or a real dud.

'It can be hit or miss, which is why a photographer must consistently make the effort to be at a location and ready.

'I feel I was rewarded for the dozens of early mornings I've had that produced no images. I could see that the clouds were breaking up and that the lake was still, so my hopes were rising.

'I kept looking behind me, checking for a hole in the eastern horizon that the sun might break through.

'What is unusual about this shot is that the sun managed to find its way through clouds to illuminate Grinnell Peak, but little else.

'I couldn't see the cloud break where the sun came from, but was certainly glad it made it through.

'Normally, I would have expected and hoped that the clouds and surrounding peaks would turn the same brilliant orange but that never happened.

'The peak glowed for maybe a couple of minutes, and then the sky fizzled to grey. In the end, this is what makes the shot unique since the peak stands out from the rest of the landscape and becomes a real focal point.'
