A Nando's fanatic who attempted a challenge to eat in every branch of the chicken chain in order to get unlimited free food, spent £1000 on the challenge - before finding out the contest had closed.

Christopher Poole, 26, read that the restaurant would give the coveted 'black card' - which guarantees free food for life - to anyone who could prove they had eaten in every one of the firm's 1031 stores worldwide.

But after dining in 85 UK branches - and putting on a stone - he found that the deal, promoted more than two years ago, is no longer running.

He had read online that Nando's would give an infamous 'black card' - which guarantees free food for life - to anyone who could prove they had eaten in every one of the firm's 1031 stores worldwide

Mr Poole, from St Albans, Hertfordshire - who has even invented his own special 'Nando's pose': 'I heard about this competition to eat at every Nandos branch and thought it sounded right up my street.

'I love chicken and eat in there a couple of nights a week anyway, so decided to embrace the challenge. I'd do anything to get my hands on a card giving me free chicken.

'I've dedicated a year to travelling around the UK, eating in as many of the 280 British restaurants as I can.

Portuguese chain restaurant three to four times a week 

'There are more than 300 Nando's in Australia, and I was planning to go there next year - but then I heard that the contest wasn't even valid anymore.

'I was gutted.'

But when Nando's bosses heard about his efforts - which have seen him gain a stone in weight since the start of the year - they have now agreed to honour their old promotion if Chris can eat in the chain's 900 other branches worldwide.

Mr Poole said: 'I'm thrilled that they have recognised my efforts, and I'm more determined than ever to complete the challenge.'

Mr Poole has been charting his Nando's challenge on social media and has posed for a photograph in each restaurant, with his hand up to his forehead in a 'Nando's pose' which imitates a cockerel- the symbol of Nando's.

The UK has 280 Nando's restaurants, and with just over 100 in London, Chris made sure he started his challenge in the capital.

He said: 'It all started when I was really busy and kept popping into my local Nando's for dinner. Before I knew it, I had been in every day for two weeks.

'I still loved the food so I started visiting friends all over London and trying out different Nando's restaurants wherever I went.'

'Once I have done the UK, I am then going to move onto Australia where there are around 300. I am hoping to do as many as I can in just 40 days- I plan on eating Nando's for every meal.'

Currently, filmaker Chris dines in the Portuguese chain restaurant three to four times a week and offers a review of the restaurant, food, and occasionally his dining company on his Facebook page.

He has documented his challenge by taking a photograph of himself in every restaurant he dined in

'The Nando's pose has really taken off- I have had people from all over the world sending me pictures of themselves in their local Nando's doing it.'

Mr Poole said: 'I have started to receive requests from random people who invite me to join them for food in their local Nando's.

Nando's sent a pack of 'chicken cheques' entitling Mr Poole to free meals, as a thanks for his dedication - and of course their famous Peri-Peri sauce

'I've been invited on about 10 Nan-dates so far, and it's great to meet new people who love their food as much as I do.'

'I even have managers of different branches asking me to come and visit and review their restaurant."'

'I have spent around £1,000 on all the food and I am still not sick of it.

'I have put on about a stone in weight as well so I am trying to stay away from the Peri Peri chips.'

Mr Poole said he likes to vary his food choices, but his favourite meal is a chicken pitta with cheese and pineapple, a chicken leg and Peri Peri chips.

'I still have a lot of Nando's to visit but I am looking forward to exploring the world while eating my favourite meal. And it will be worth it in order to have unlimited chicken for life.'

A spokesman for Nando’s said: 'We’re always delighted to hear from Nando’s superfans and the lengths they go to for their love of PERi-PERi chicken.

'Some time ago, we ran a challenge that rewarded individuals with free Nando’s if they could prove they ate at every Nando’s restaurant in the world.

'There are now so many Nando’s worldwide, that we don't run the challenge any more.

'However, if Christopher Poole completes his attempt, we will happily honour our original promise and give him free Nando’s for life.'
