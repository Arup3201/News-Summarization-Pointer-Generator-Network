Microsoft has revealed that Windows 8 will be released on 26 October.

The latest version of its operating system has been described by the firm as 'as the most important redesign of its interface in more than a decade.'

Windows 8 includes a touch-controlled interface dubbed Metro as well as a more traditional desktop.

The software will also run on the Surface family of tablets, which was announced last month in a bid to take on Apple and Google in the tablet market.

The announcement was made a day before the firm releases its fourth quarter earnings report, when analysts say it may post its first ever loss after writing down the value of a troubled takeover.

The firm paid $6.3bn (Â£4bn) for the online advertising service Aquantive in 2007 but has said the service did not perform as expected. As a result its earnings will be offset by a $6.2bn charge.

Microsoft hopes Windows 8 will help it compete with Apple by allowing progams to work on both desktop and mobile gadgets.

The Surface tablets also mark the first time Microsoft has made its own hardware, causing consternation among other tablet makers.

However, since announcing the news chief executive Steve Ballmer has sought to reassure them, describing Surface as "a design point" that would have a place within a "broad Windows ecosystem"

Microsoft is releasing the software as a 
downloadable upgrade for PC owners, and letting PC makers start selling 
computers with Windows 8 the same day.

As an upgrade for users of Windows XP, Vista or 7, Windows will cost $40.

People who bought a Windows 7 computer on June 2 or later can upgrade for $15.

Whatever the case, investors appear hopeful despite the problems with Aquantive.

"Microsoft's stock is up 17% since 
the start of the year in part because of anticipation for Windows 8 and 
Surface," Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst at BGC Partners told 
the BBC.

"We're also still seeing nearly one million PCs sold worldwide a day so that's a sizeable marketplace for them."
