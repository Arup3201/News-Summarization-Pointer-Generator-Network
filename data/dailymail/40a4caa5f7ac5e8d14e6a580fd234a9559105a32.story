The San Giorgio, an Italian navy transporter, also received 89 passengers onto its deck by 9pm AEST, and one was taken to hospital suffering from heart disease.

At least ten merchant boats have been employed to assist with the rescue operation, with staff on board providing blankets for evacuees.

Helicopters have been travelling between shore and the ferry, completing 34 trips and airlifting at least seven people, reported USA Today. 

Rescue crew worked throughout the night to airlift passengers from the upper deck of the ferry, after they became trapped as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts by Greek and Italian emergency services.

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samras said the 'massive and unprecedented operation saved the lives of hundreds of passengers following the fire on the ship in the Adriatic Sea — under the most difficult circumstances,' reported The NY Times. 

'Notwithstanding the weather and the darkness, which is another factor, we persisted throughout the entire night,' Italian coast guard Admiral Giovanni Pettorino said.

Italian navy Capt. Riccardo Rizzotto said that the priority for the rescue crews was the safety of the passengers, reported USA Today.

A Greek man was reported dead and his wife injured when they became trapped in a lifeboat chute, but authorities have said that it is unclear how the death and injury occurred.

Both were transported to Brindisi in southern Italy by helicopter, said Admiral Pettorino.

The second injury occurred when a member of the Italian navy was also injured during the rescue process.

The boat, run by Greek ferry operator Anek Lines, was sailing to Ancona in Italy from Patros in western Greece, when it caught fire just before 6am local time.

The ferry was 44 nautical miles from Corfu and was carrying 478 passengers and crew along with 222 vehicles.

The ship's manifest listed passengers from Austria, Turkey, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece, reported The ABC. 

Nick Channing-Williams, 37, a British show jumper, was also one of the 478 people who became stranded when a fire broke out on the car deck of the  Norman Atlantic.

One British woman and her two children have been airlifted to safety, while the woman's husband is still reported to be on board.   

Some passengers were reportedly stranded on an upper deck of the ferry for more than eight hours, unable to be lowered to lifeboats due to the high seas.

Some called TV stations in desperation, saying: ‘We are burning and sinking, no one can save us,’ as the vessel was battered by 55mph winds.

Others told how the blaze swept through the vessel, fuelled by vats of olive oil in trucks catching light.

Greece's shipping minister Miltiadis Varvitsiotis said that the fate of the ferry was yet to be determined, and that it's final destination had not been confirmed.  

One passenger died and another was injured while attempting to escape the ferry in stormy conditions

Passengers remain trapped on the blazing ferry, off the coast of Corfu, as gale-force winds and choppy seas hamper the rescue effort. The vessel caught alight at 6am local time with 478 passengers and crew on board 

Some passengers called TV stations in desperation, saying: ‘We are burning and sinking, no one can save us’

They also described how their shoes melted in the heat and the smell of plastic pervaded the corridors. On deck, passengers were battered by rain and lightning storms. 

‘There’s a lot of smoke, we can’t breathe,’ passenger Nikos Papatheodosiou told Greece’s state-run Nerit television yesterday evening. ‘Panic, there’s panic,’ he said. 

The cause of the fire was not immediately clear but Greek media reported it may have spread because of the burning olive oil. 

Dorothy Channing-Williams last night said her son Nick, a competitive show jumper and trainer, and his Greek fiancée Regina Theoffili were still on board.

She added: ‘There’s about 300 people still on board and it is the cold that’s most difficult.’

Mr Channing-Williams – whose late father Simon produced the Oscar-winning film The Constant Gardener and the Bafta-winning Vera Drake – is believed to be one of two Britons on board. 

Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers in pairs as the ferry was being towed after it drifted in fierce winds into Albanian waters

A tearful Mrs Channing-Williams said her son first made contact at 4am but urged her not to worry.

She said: ‘He said that he had been on the top deck for the last seven hours with rain, and thunder and lightning, but he was making light of it because he knew I would be so worried. They’ve apparently blocked all people’s mobiles because they thought it was hampering the rescue effort.’

The 70-year-old, from Newbury, Berkshire, added: ‘He called me to let me know that he’s okay and that Regina’s okay.’

Other panic-stricken passengers called TV stations and pleaded for help. Sofoklis Styliaras called Mega TV from his mobile, saying: ‘The fire is still burning. On the lower deck, where the lifeboats are, our shoes were starting to melt...there’s nowhere else for us to go.’

Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers, who described their shoes melting in the searing heat 

Another, Giorgos Stiliaras, said those on board were having trouble breathing with all the smoke. ‘We are outside, we are very cold, the ship is full of smoke,’ he said. ‘The boat is still burning, the floors are boiling.’ Speaking from a hospital in Italy, 

Vassiliki Tavrizelou, who was rescued along with her two-year-old daughter, spoke to the media from her hospital bed in Lecce, southern Italy. 

She said: 'They called first on women and children to be evacuated from the ship.

'Ships could not approach us because of the rain and winds. We were at least four hours on the deck, in the cold and rain.'

She recalled the ship alarm going off and seeing fire from her cabin. 'Then we heard explosions,' she said.
