Ben Morgan’s hopes of being fit for the World Cup are in doubt after it emerged the Gloucester No 8 faces a minimum of six months on the sidelines with a serious leg injury.

Sportsmail understands the 25-year-old had a metal plate and nine screws inserted into his left leg during the early hours of Saturday morning, having suffered a spiral fracture  and severe ligament damage in the victory over Saracens.

The forward was carried off on a stretcher after a heavy second-half collision at Kingsholm, where he required oxygen as part of a lengthy on-field treatment process in the Aviva Premiership match.

Morgan was named England's player of the series after his superb display against Australia in November 

Having been named man of the series during the autumn internationals, Morgan was expected feature heavily in England’s crucial World Cup year.

But he will play no part in the Six Nations and, with his return to action understood to be scheduled for July at the earliest, he is unlikely to be fit for the initial two-week squad meet at Pennyhill Park and the high-altitude training camp in Denver.

He suffered the injury in a tackle involving Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola, who is now in pole position to take over the jersey in his absence.
