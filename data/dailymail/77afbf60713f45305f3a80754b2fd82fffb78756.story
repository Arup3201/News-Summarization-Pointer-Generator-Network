These shocking images reveal the true extent of a 'filthy, stinking' hotel which tried to fine a couple  for leaving a negative review on TripAdvisor.

The Broadway Hotel in Blackpool charged retired van driver Tony Jenkinson, 63, and his 64-year-old wife Jan £100 extra after they described the establishment as a 'rotten stinking hovel' in their damning online review. 

The review sparked a row between the couple and the hotel, which said it operated a 'no bad review policy', as stated in its terms and conditions.

But now these photos, taken inside the hotel, offer a glimpse into the conditions with which the pair faced during their one-night stay.

The images, from TripAdvisor, show peeling paintwork, cracked plaster, a dirty shower - and even a pair of worn socks left languishing in one of the bedroom drawers.

It comes as the couple, who have been fighting to recoup the money through their credit card company, are said to be expecting a refund. 

The review, which was posted in August, branded the hotel a 'filthy, dirty rotten stinking hovel'. 

Mr Jenkinson, from Whitehaven, Cumbria, wrote: 'The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the carpet was thin, dirty and stained. The bed was something else, it must have come out of the ark.' 

He added: 'This place should be shut down, I don't know if they are ever inspected, but if so, I don't know how this place has passed!' 

Previous reviewers had despaired over 'bedrooms full of mould' and 'staff drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast' at the hotel, which is ranked at 858 out of 894 places to stay in the seaside resort. 

Sharon W wrote: 'Don't go there.' Jeanette M, from Derby, added: 'A bedroom full of mould, no heater, no hot water. Staff drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast.' And Dolores C, from York, wrote simply: 'Words fail me. Terrible, terrible, terrible.' 

Blackpool Council said today that they understood that the hotel will reimburse Mr and Mrs Jenkinson, as well as scrapping the policy.

The Blackpool establishment fined a couple £100 for writing a negative review about the business on TripAdvisor - despite these images which show the state of the hotel

Mr Jenkinson said the wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the carpet was thin, dirty and stained

He added that the place should be shut down and questionned how it had ever passed an inspection 

Gillian Campbell, cabinet member responsible for public protection at the local authority, said: 'Our trading standards team became aware of this issue last week.

'As a result, we have spoken to the hotel owner and asked for the policy to be removed, which has now happened. This is a unique case and not one that we have come across before.'

The controversy emerged after couple stopped at the hotel on their way to Oxford, where they paid £36 for a night in a double room.

But they said they encountered a string of problems, prompting Mr Jenkinson to post the review on August 30 in which he branded the hotel a 'filthy, dirty, rotten, stinking hovel'. 

The Jenkinsons said they discovered the £100 charge on their credit card statement a few days later.

In his review, Mr Jenkinson described the bed as 'something else' and 'coming out of the ark'

But when they queried the charge, they were said to have been told it was incurred under a 'no bad review policy' included in the terms and conditions.

The hotel's policy said: 'Despite the fact that repeat customers and couples love our hotel, your friends and family may not. For every bad review left on any website, the group organiser will be charged a maximum £100 per review. 

The couple then complained to Cumbria trading standards officials, who passed the matter to counterparts in Blackpool.

John Greenbank, trading standards area manager north, said: 'I have worked for trading standards for many years and have never seen anything like this.

Several reviewers have complained about cracks in the plaster on the walls of the hotel 

'The hotel management clearly thinks that they have come up with a novel way to prevent bad reviews. However, we believe this could be deemed an unfair trading practice.' 

Tim Coglan, head of Blackpool's Trading Standards, said: 'We have met with the hotel management and from now on this clause which they ask people to sign when they book in alongside other terms and conditions will be removed.'

A spokesman at the hotel said: 'Yes there have been talks with the council. I do not wish to say anything more.'

Councillor John McCreesh said: 'Customers need to be free to be honest about the service they're getting.

'Other customers depend upon it. Hotel owners should focus on getting their service right rather than shutting down aggrieved customers with threats and fines.

'People should have the right to vent their disappointment if a hotel stay did not meet their expectations and should not be prevented from having their say.' 

The hotel could not be reached for comment. Its website appeared to be down.

TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 'While, thankfully, such instances are very rare, it is completely against the spirit and policies of our site for any business owner to attempt to bully or intimidate reviewers who have had a negative experience. 

'Where we find evidence of a business doing so, we will take action to protect the integrity of our site.' 

The hotel is still open open for business. At reception there was a large notice stating: 'We no longer take verbal abuse as tips'. 

It also warns that people who use the car park without permission must pay a £300 tow-away fee. 

Retired van driver Mr Jenkinson said: 'I am waiting for a refund.
