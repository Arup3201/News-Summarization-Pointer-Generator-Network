Steven Lumb, 56, from Stackstead, Lancashire, has carried out 162 offences over the last 43 years and committed his first burglary when he was just 13

A criminal who has spent 44 years committing crimes but managing to avoid jail with an array of excuses has escaped prison again – by claiming he stole Marks & Spencer steaks to feed his dog because his benefits were cut.

Steven Lumb, 56, from Stackstead, Lancashire, has carried out a total of 162 offences over the last four decades and committed his first burglary when he was just 13.

However, despite his prolific history, he has regularly been given 'chances' by courts after blaming his crimes on an array of excuses.

Over the years he has come up with a string of excuses including a drink and drugs habit, a claim he had been committing crime for so long it was 'difficult' to give it up, warning judges that going to prison would mean losing his home - and even blaming one theft on a bout of 'insomnia.'

Last July, just four months after being given a further suspended jail term imposed for yet another raid, he was caught stealing three steaks from his local Marks and Spencer store.

But at Burnley Crown Court, jobless Lumb was spared jail again after claiming he was stealing the £6 steaks to feed his new pet dog as his state benefits had been cut.

Instead of being jailed, his 12-month suspended sentence was extended by six months and he was ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme.

Passing sentence Judge Simon Newell told Lumb: 'Nobody wants to send you to prison for something like that, but if you carry on doing it, that's what's going to happen. You've got to take this as a warning.'

Previous court hearings were told how Lumb had a 'lamentable' criminal record with his first offence being a burglary in 1970.

After racking up a string of motoring convictions after failing to pass his driving test, he was jailed in 2002 for 15 months for dangerous driving after embarking on a driving jaunt which culminated in him ploughing his car into a telegraph pole while fleeing police.

In 2004, he was back in court after he broke into the garage of a retired teacher and walked off with a box tools. The victim and a friend tried to carry out a citizen's arrest but Lumb tried to bite one of them on the arm in a bid to break free.

Burnley Crown and County Combined Court heard how Lumb blamed his latest crime - in which he stole steaks worth £6 from Marks & Spencer - on the fact he needed to feed his dog because his benefits had been cut

He was later given an 18 month community rehabilitation order by magistrates and warned 'it was his last chance' after he told how his best friend had died in his arms and he wanted to attend the funeral.

He also claimed it had been 'difficult' to give up his life of crime due to his 'unsettled' home life.

But, in June 2007, he was back in court after police found him pulling a wheelie bin along the street which had a haul of lead inside.

Despite admitting theft and being in breach of a court order, he went free again with a conditional discharge after blaming his offending on 'insomnia'.

In January last year, he was given another conditional discharge after stealing meat products worth £24 from the Co-op, in Bacup, and abstracting £60 worth of electricity.

And last November he was arrested again after he was caught drunkenly trying to raid the home of another victim in Stacksteads, Lancashire - only to fall down a flight of steps while trying to escape.

Over the years, 56-year-old Lumb has used an array of excuses to avoid prison including blaming his crimes on insomnia and a drink and drugs habit

The 63-year-old victim was awoken by the sound of what he thought was clanging steel from outside only to see the front living room window had been smashed and Lumb staggering away from his front garden.

The occupant tried to follow but lost sight of Lumb who climbed over a fence into a neighbouring property and made off.

Lumb was later arrested and picked out on a video identity parade.

In March last year, he went to court and insisted he had been attending counselling session for his drink and drug problems and walked free after a different judge told him: 'I find myself persuaded to give you another chance.'

The latest offence took place at the Burnley branch of M&S on July 16.

Lumb was due to be sentenced at Pennine Magistrates' Court after admitting theft but his case was transferred Burnley Crown Court where a judge's sentencing powers would have been greater.

The court heard how Lumb's motivation to beat his criminal behaviour had improved 'massively' while on a drugs programme and it appeared he was getting on top of his heroin use.

Previously, he was on four or five bags of drugs a day, but he was now down to two a week and was 'smoking rather than injecting'.

Probation officer Nicholas Powell said Lumb had got the dog so he could get out more by taking it for walks and to help 'remove himself' from other drug users.

He told how Lumb committed the theft after he went out visiting his family and said: 'It would appear there are elements of stability in his life at the moment.'

As well as an extended suspended sentence, Lumb was also given a six month supervision order.
