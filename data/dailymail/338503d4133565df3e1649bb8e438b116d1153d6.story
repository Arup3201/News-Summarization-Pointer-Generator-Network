The  pitch invader that stormed to the centre circle for a 'selfie' with Frank Lampard has been bailed by police and is likely to receive a three-match ban  from Manchester City.

The youngster was released by police on Wednesday night after the fan evaded security to sprint on to the field to hug two-goal Lampard and persuade him to pose for a photograph during the 7-0 Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday. 

The supporter was subsequently led away in handcuffs but City will ask questions of their security ahead of their next home game against Roma in the Champions League next Tuesday.

Real Madrid fan Ronald Gjoka spent the night in jail after running on to the pitch to embrace Cristiano Ronaldo during the International Champions Cup clash with Chelsea last year.

Two AC Milan supporters also entered the field of play in July to greet Mario Balotelli before being rushed off by security staff.

Brian Clough famously cuffed some of his own Nottingham Forest supporters who invaded the pitch against QPR in 1989. 

A statement from Greater Manchester Police said: 'On Wednesday 24 September 2014 at around 9.30pm, a teenage boy ran on to the pitch at the city of Manchester stadium during the match.

'A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of encroachment of the pitch, he was been bailed until 19 October 2014.'

Asked about the incident with the fan straight after the match, City boss Manuel Pellegrini said: 'He deserved the hug.

'He is a star in England and I'm very happy for him.

'For me, it is never difficult to put good players in the team. The problem is when you don't have the players.

'He is a very important player for our team and maybe, at 36, he cannot play three games in a row. But Frank is a top player.'

City progressed thanks to two goals from Lampard and another double from Edin Dzeko, with all the goals coming in the second half.

Lampard could now be in line to stay at City beyond January, with Pellegrini saying: 'It is an issue that we will see further down the line.

'We will see what happens in January and we have two or three months to decide.

'He deserves all the praise he can get from the fans. We will do what is best for the team and the player.

'We must talk about a lot of things, but it is not impossible for him to stay here.' 

Jesus Navas and Yaya Toure added to the tally, while Jose Angel Pozo scored on his debut for City.
