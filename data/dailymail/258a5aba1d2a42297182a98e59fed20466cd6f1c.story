A Real Housewife has come under fire for promoting 'marital rape' in her book about how to 'keep the romance alive and the home fires burning'.

Melissa Gorga who came to fame for her role on Real Housewives of New Jersey has penned a book about her marriage and one portion that her husband Joe contributed is causing outrage.

'Men, I know you think your woman isn't the type who wants to be taken. But trust me, she is. Every girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a while. If your wife says "no," turn her around, and rip her clothes off. She wants to be dominated,' he wrote. 

'Women don't realize how easy men are. Just give us what we want.'

Outrage: Melissa Gorga's new book talks at length about her sex life with her husband and she says that wives should do everything to please their husband and avoid fights

The couple's sex life is discussed at length in the book by both of the Gorgas, and Melissa advocates both 'real passionate sex and maintenance sex'.

'Maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased, the lines of communication open, and the fights to a minimum,' she wrote, according to Jezebel.

Her frequent mentions of fights that are avoided using sex has raised some eyebrows about their tempestuous relationship.

'In the beginning, Joe wanted to have sex every single day, at least once, if not twice or three times…If I didn't give it to him once a day, he'd get upset,' she wrote.

Weighing in: Joe Gorga says that even if the woman says no, men should dominate them and force them to have sex

'I can do something that pisses him off on a Monday, but if we had sex on Sunday night, it blows over more easily. But if we haven't done it for two days and I give him attitude? It could be a huge fight.'

Joe Gorga is the brother of Teresa Giudice, who is another one of the stars on the New Jersey-based reality show.

In spite of her tips about how she has to be home when her husband gets home and how she dresses to impress him, Gorga maintains that the book- like their marriage- is all about 'mutual respect'.

'I think it's controversial in many ways because we do really live an old school type of marriage but with a modern twist,' she said in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight.

The Gorgas have three children- two boys and a girl- and Gorga has said that she will be happy to give the book to her daughter when she gets married someday so that she knows how to approach her own marriage.

Though her marriage is said to be 'hot and happy', her continual fights with Teresa remain a regular storyline on the reality show.

Love: Joe has been at Melissa's side during a number of book appearances

There's real passionate sex and maintenance sex. You need them both for a healthy marriage. Maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased, the lines of communication open, and the fights to a minimum.The way I see it, if a wife is a puttana, her husband will never feel the urge to go outside the marriage to actual whores, or strip clubs. He won't hit on women in bars, or drool over his friend's girlfriends or the secretary. He'll rush home to his wife, who makes sure he'll have a good time (the best time) in the comfort of his own home.Back in our early years, we'd go to the bar, and I'd make the rounds and talk to everyone. When we got home, Joe would say, "I feel like we didn't hang out. Like you talked to everyone else more." Now, you might think, "Why is he so needy?" He's not. Joe doesn't need me to hold his hand at a party. It's about respect and loyalty…We arrive together. We stay near each other. We leave together.

JOE GORGA'S QUOTES FROM THE BOOK:

Men,
I know you think your woman isn't the type who wants to be taken. But 
trust me, she is. Every girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a 
while. If your wife says "no," turn her around, and rip her clothes off.
She wants to be dominated.

Women don't realize how easy men are. Just give us what we want.

To
be on the same level, everyone has to get off the high horse. I don't 
care if the woman makes more money than the man, if he's a janitor and 
she's the president. After a fourteen-hour workday, if a man comes home 
and there's no dinner on the table, and his wife is on the phone, 
watching TV, or on the computer ignoring him, he won't feel respected.
