Each one has poured his heart out to her in their weekly chats at the Palace.

But as four of her Prime Ministers greeted the Queen for lunch at Downing Street yesterday there was only one topic of conversation – their delight at helping her celebrate her Diamond Jubilee.

As she lined up with David Cameron, Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the Queen’s smile hinted at secrets kept and confidences held.

Thanks to her weekly chats with them 
over the years – 538 hours in all as Mr Cameron told her – she probably 
knows these four much better than they know each other.

Only Baroness Thatcher, who is in frail health, was unable to attend yesterday’s extraordinary gathering at No 10.

Political rivalries and intrigues may
have been put aside for the day but officials still muttered darkly of a
‘seating plan from hell’.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood 
and Deputy PM Nick Clegg were expediently placed to provide ‘buffer 
zones’ to limit any tensions across the table.

Gordon Brown, who was making his 
first visit to Downing Street since leaving office, has had awkward 
relations with both Mr Blair and Mr Clegg, and was seated between Dame 
Norma Major and Sir Jeremy. 

The Queen was flanked by Mr Cameron and Sir John. Mr Cameron’s wife Samantha and Mr Clegg’s wife Miriam 
Gonzalez Durantez were the other guests.

After drinks in the Downing Street 
study, they tucked into a starter of salmon, main course of roast duck 
breast with potatoes and seasonal vegetables, and a dessert of trifle.

Her Majesty’s blue patterned dress and hat were the height of fashion. They must have been.

Samantha Cameron’s £495 dress, by cutting-edge designer Jonathan Saunders, was exactly the same shade.

The rather public fashion faux pas 
was unlike the Prime Minister's wife who, as a member of the British 
Fashion Council, rarely puts a well-clad foot wrong when it comes to 
matters of style.

As their husbands Mr Cameron and Prince Philip stood awkwardly by their side the two women posed together in the sunshine, and while Samantha smiled happily for the photographers the Queen's stony face told a very different story and it was clear that the monarch was not amused.

A spokesman from Clarence House confirmed today that there are no rules when it comes to choosing an outfit when meeting the Queen, and the Royal never makes the colour of her clothing known before an event.

But the wardrobe clash will be an embarrassment for the brunette who is known for her immaculate styling. As well as being startlingly similar in colour both outfits featured a digital style blue and white print.

The Sovereign rarely sets foot inside 
No 10. Mr Cameron is thought to be only the sixth of her 12 prime 
ministers to invite her to such a gathering.

Mr Blair threw a dinner to mark the Golden Jubilee, attended by Sir Edward Heath, Lord Callaghan, Lady Thatcher, and Sir John.
