Dr Robert Hadden Manhattan gynecologist has been charged with sexually abusing his patients, most of whom were pregnant

A Manhattan gynecologist has been charged with sexually abusing his patients, most of whom were pregnant.

Gynecologist Dr Robert Hadden worked at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital when the alleged assaults took place in his office in 2012.

According to prosecutors, Hadden also subjected the women to 'overly frequent and invasive breast exams' and asked them 'invasive questions about their sex lives'.

The abuse is alleged to have occurred in the rooms of his private Manhattan offices and only after nurses left the doctor and his patient alone in the examination room, reports the New York Post.

'He was absolutely a predator,' said lawyer Anthony DiPietro, whose client filed a civil suit against Hadden last year alleging abuse.

Hadden's lawyer, Isabelle Kishner, said her client would plead not guilty to all charges, calling him a 'physician with an impeccable reputation'.

It's not the first time Hadden's conduct has been questioned by police.

In 2013 two victims - identified only by their initials - L.K. and A.Y. - went to police claiming they had been sexually assaulted by Hadden, prompting him to stop seeing patients altogether.

That lawsuit ended up being dismissed after the prosecution failed to deliver documents by the court's deadline.

Hadden has since been released on a $21,253 bond.
