A pet owner found her beloved cat had been branded with the message 'please neut this cat' in red felt-tip pen.

Mother-of-three Sharon Munns, from Bedford, spoke of her horror at finding 11-year-old Becks with his back shaved and the words written on.

The RSPCA has condemned the incident describing it as a 'senseless attack'.

Branded: Sharon Munn, from Bedford, with her cat, Becks, who has been shaved and written on

The 42-year-old believes it may have been a case of mistaken identity as there's another cat in the neighbourhood who looks very similar to Becks.

She told Bedfordshire on Sunday: 'We had Becks neutered about eight years ago so it must be either somebody new to the area who isn't aware of that or they've got him mixed up with another cat.'

The council employee's 21-year-old daughter Amy found Becks on Thursday evening and woke her mother to tell her what had happened.

Mrs Munns added: 'I wanted to go out and knock on everybody's door to find out who had done it. I couldn't believe it and don't know who could have done such a thing.

Mrs Munns said: 'I wanted to go out and knock on everybody's door to find out who had done it. I couldn't believe it and don't know who could have done such a thing.'

'We think he's OK but there was a white mark on his back where they've clearly shaved deeper.'

She immediately reported it to the police and the RSPCA.

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'This must have been a very frightening experience for the cat and we understand the owners' distress at this senseless attack on their pet.

'If anyone has any information on who did this can they please call our inspector information line on 0300 123 8018 where they can speak to someone in confidence.'

Bedfordshire Police confirmed they received an initial report of the incident and said an appointment had been made to visit Mrs Munns to establish whether it would be deemed criminal damage.
