Waking up to discover your boiler is broken and you have no hot water could soon be a thing of the past.

British Gas has teamed up with Worcester Bosch to test a smart boiler that can diagnose early signs of faults and breakdowns before the tank fails completely.

This generates an alert, which prompts a call centre agent to arrange an engineer visit.

The smart boiler uses Worcester Bosch technology to diagnose faults.It has a built-in wireless transmitter and a separate ‘hub’ which connects to the customers’ Wi-Fi network.The boiler regularly sends data to British Gas, in real time, which is automatically analysed and if signs of a fault are detected, an alarm is raised

More than 700 homes are taking part in the trial across the UK, which runs until the end of 2014.

If the fault can be fixed remotely, an engineer will make the changes and the customer will be informed.

If it can’t be resolved, a call centre agent will arrange for an engineer to visit the property and fix the boiler.

The benefit of the diagnostic tool is that the engineer will know what the fault is before they arrive, meaning they can take the correct part with them.

Kassir Hussain, director of British Gas Connected Homes, said: ‘Current boiler technology means many engineer visits to investigate a boiler fault result in a return visits because engineers cannot carry every potential spare part with them for every visit.’

‘Connected Boilers which can tell us what the fault is remotely mean we can fix boilers first time, much more reliably.

‘It’s never convenient when a boiler needs repairing - but this revolutionary new system will mean engineer visits are shorter.

‘In some cases, we’ll be able to contact the customer and arrange to fix the boiler before our customer even notices a problem.’
