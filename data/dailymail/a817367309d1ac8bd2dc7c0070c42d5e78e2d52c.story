Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is coming out swinging on behalf of both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, insisting that neither should be second-guessed on their foreign policy records.

The nanny-state pol, now a registered independent after years in both the Republicans and Democratic parties, said Clinton likely did all she could about the situation in Libya that led to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

'I think most of the criticisms of 
Hillary are totally unfounded – you can maybe disagree with her 
policies, but what'd you expect her to do in Benghazi?' he said in a recent interview.

Bloomberg's backing comes as a new House committee is set to focus intensely on the Clinton-led State Department's failure to protect its Benghazi diplomatic compound in the months before armed terrorists laid waste to it, a congressional source told MailOnline on Monday.

Former New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg is backing Hillary Clinton in her political life-or-death struggle with House Republicans over the deadly 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attack

The U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi erupted in flames during a terror attack by armed militants on September 11, 2012, just months after al-Qaeda-linked groups rallied in the city with dozens of military vehicles

'I mean, it's that kind of cheap politics which I don’t like. She’s very competent,' Bloomberg told Politico of Republicans' tactics to date.

Clinton has come under fire from Republicans for initially blaming the September 11, 2012 terror attack in the eastern Libya port city on a spontaneous protest allegedly sparked by a crude anti-Muslim video.

Her statements immediately after the attack, and just weeks before Obama's re-election, were later proven false when intelligence reports and internal White House emails made it clear that the administration knew immediately that an al-Qaeda-linked Islamist terror group was responsible.

But amid House Republicans' zeal to paint Clinton as a serial fabricator in advance of her decision on whether to run for president, they have asked few questions publicly about State Department policies and decisions before the attack took place.

A 2014 Senate report concluded that the Benghazi terror strike was 'likely preventable' because State knew about security lapses and received several prior warnings about a deteriorating situation there.

And evidence emerged in November that an al-Qaeda affiliate held a 2012 rally, parade and press conference in central Benghazi months before the 9/11 attack that year, and that the State Department was notified. At the event, terror leaders warned that 'assassinations' would follow.

That same group, Ansar al-Shariah, led the September attack that killed four.

In the five months before the deadly attack, the U.S. facility that would later fall was assaulted twice by armed militants.

On April 6, 2012, two former security guards there threw IEDs over a fence at the compound. And on June 6 of that year terrorists detonated an explosive at the main perimeter gate, blowing a hole in it that a whistle-blower later told Congress was 'big enough for forty men to go through.'

Republicans'
 strategy is set to change with the seating of a new select committee in
 the House of Representatives charged solely with investigating the 
terror attack.

'Believe
 me, the committee will be less concerned with how the administration 
spun what happened than with why it happened in the first place,' an 
aide to a Republican member of that committee told MailOnline on Monday.

Ansar al-Shariah openly holds rallies, marches and news conferences in the Middle East, often boasting that they hold power in cities where police presences are nonexistent and government control is weak

Ansar al-Shariah, the group behind the Benghazi attack, frequently holds rallies in Northern Africa like this one in Tunisia. The State Dept. knew a similar event happened in Benghazi in June 2012 but did nothing to beef up security

South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy (C) is chairing a new House panel on Benghazi, a committee that expects to focus intensely on why the State Department ignored warnings about the deteriorating security situation at its diplomatic post in Benghazi

The aide requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly about the committee's plans.

That posture will likely dredge up the less-incendiary questions about why the Clinton-led State Department denied multiple requests for added security forces at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, and at a nearby CIA annex facility.

Clinton addressed the GOP's investigative forward motion last week, telling a New York City audience that 'I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way, but they get to call the shots in the Congress.'

On Fox News Sunday, committee chair Rep. Trey Gowdy suggested Clinton was derelict for not pulling diplomats out of Benghazi after every other Western nation had done so.

'Why were we still in Benghazi?' he asked. 'The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi and I would like to know why.'
