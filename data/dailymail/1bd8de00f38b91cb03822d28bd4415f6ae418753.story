As a gauge for Brendan Rodgers to measure Liverpool's regression it might be quite accurate. No better at the back than they were six months ago, much worse up front and utterly devoid of belief.

At least, when they somehow converted a three-goal lead into a six-goal draw at Crystal Palace in May, they were in gung-ho pursuit of the goals to bring the title to Anfield for the first time in 20 years.

Again they took the lead at Selhurst Park, but it was all downhill after Rickie Lambert had hit the target after 91 seconds, and again they again conceded three, with Neil Warnock reaching for the salt to declare his disappointment at not scoring more.

Dwight Gayle levelled before half-time and Palace's heavily-bearded midfield warriors Joe Ledley and Mile Jedinak scored a goal each in a frenzied three-minute spell near the end of a rain-soaked game.

Gayle and Ledley owed theirs to Yannick Bolasie, outstanding on the left-wing, where he tormented ill-protected Liverpool full-back Javier Manquillo, while Jedinak's was a stunning free-kick from 25 yards.

Palace danced in delight as they sprang out of the Barclays Premier League's bottom three to within two points of their visitors, who next travel to Bulgaria to face Ludogorets in the Champions League.

Rodgers must stop this rotten run of results, even if that means sacrificing principles and making unpopular selection decisions. It will be a real test of his judgment. His team have lost four in a row and have not won in the Premier League since mid-October.

Six months ago, Liverpool were fresh, flamboyant and sure to score goals but the sale of Luis Suarez, form dips and injuries have left them looking miles from that standard.

Rodgers has lost the balance and rhythm which made Liverpool so entertaining. He has lost the menace in attack but not the vulnerability at the back or the nagging questions about character and leadership, which Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher aired again on Sky TV.

Without Daniel Sturridge or Mario Balotelli, Lambert started and scored his first Liverpool goal, when Adam Lallana caught Palace's former Liverpool full-back Martin Kelly napping. Lambert collected it with the outside of his right foot and drove the ball low past Julian Speroni.

'It could have knocked the stuffing out of us,' said Warnock. 'You could see they were determined from the way they started and the way they celebrated that goal. But you can score too early sometimes and we created some good chances. We'd have done most teams today. I'm disappointed we didn't score more, really.'

Liverpool were not helped by the fact Joe Allen cut his head and twice needed to leave the pitch for patching up. Gayle equalised during the second of those short spells when the visitors were a man down.

Bolasie charged forward, accepting the invitation to shoot from the central defenders who decided not to squeeze out. His effort zipped across the wet surface and thumped into a post.

With his pace and instinct, Gayle was first to the rebound, beating Martin Skrtel in a foot race, and turned it into the net via Simon Mignolet. Liverpool, having held their lead for only 10 minutes, were beset by doubt.

Palace detected blood, refusing to allow them time to settle and pass, quickly in position to punish any touch not perfect. 

The slippery conditions helped them prey on Liverpool's nerves and Bolasie relished the space available out wide, due to Liverpool's slender formation.

It was an awkward day for goalkeepers, but Mignolet made a terrific save from Bolasie, a drive which skidded up off the wet turf when Gayle might have blocked his view.

Manquillo recovered to block from Bolasie after a neat one-two with Jason Puncheon at the end of a sweeping counter-attack after clearing a corner. Bolasie sliced another shot wide before the break after Puncheon slid a pass behind Manquillo.

Liverpool dominated possession but without penetration. They rarely got behind a Palace defence which lost Damien Delaney through injury in the first half. 

Lambert twice headed crosses wide and Steven Gerrard tried his luck from long range, only to find his efforts mocked by the Selhurst crowd. 

Raheem Sterling contributed little besides a couple of penalty appeals: one when a cross crashed into Kelly's hand from close-range and another when he was manhandled by Joel Ward, but Jon Moss gave neither.

There were 12 minutes left in a messy and disjointed second-half, when Mignolet dragged a free-kick into straight touch.

From the throw, Bolasie collected a flick, hooked the ball over his own head and muscled past Dejan Lovren. He looked up pulled a cross into the path of Ledley, who finished first time, with his left foot.

Selhurst Park was still bouncing when Jedinak curled in the third from a free-kick conceded by Skrtel as he jostled with Gayle. 

It was a fourth goal in seven games for the Palace skipper and the joy was complete for Palace. The pain deepened for Liverpool.
