The high-speed 'Javelin' train designed to whisk Olympic visitors to Stratford had a false start on the opening day of the Games when this morning's first official train departed late because a driver failed to turn up for work.

The Southeastern train company had designated the 7.04am from St Pancras station in London to the Park in Stratford as the beginning of the service.

But the 140mph Japanese-built train did not leave Stratford until 7.09am, as travel bosses were forced to delay the train while it waited for a replacement driver, as the scheduled worker had called in sick.

Officials said the delay was caused by a driver who did not turn up at work due to illness

The train, pictured this morning, will eventually ferry 25,000 people per hour to and from the Olympic Park

One of those on the delayed train today was a chef working in a hospitality area at the Park.

He has been travelling to Stratford from Luton via St Pancras for the past few days.

He said today: 'Not one of my trains has been on time. It was 15 minutes late one day.'

Once under way, today’s delayed 7.04am service raced to Stratford International Station in east London in less than seven minutes.

There were also travel problems in and around east London on the day of the Opening Ceremony, as tube lines and mainline services were delayed.

One of the hold-ups was at North Greenwich where the Games’ gymnastics and basketball is being held.

The
North Greenwich problem was a signal failure on the Jubilee line - just
two stops from the main Olympic station at Stratford.

Those heading to London from East Anglia were delayed by a broken-down train at Ingatestone in Essex.

This caused hold-ups for Greater Anglia train company services into London’s Liverpool Street.

Meanwhile, Olympic fans heading for 
London on the M1 hit noontime gridlock and delays of nearly 2 hours 
after a multi-vehicle smash involving an overturned lorry today.

Black-cab London taxi drivers staged an hour long go-slow protest at Hyde Park Corner in central London over Olympic traffic lanes.

Traffic was at a standstill for about 50 minutes from 2.50pm when police cleared the area, said BBC London Travel.

This in turn led to congestion on all approaches to Hyde Park Corner at Grosvenor Place.

The demonstration came hours before 
thousands of spectators and world leaders were expected to attend the 
opening ceremony of the London Olympics.

Cabbies have held two protests over being barred from 30 miles of ‘Games Lanes ‘ reserved for  VIP Olympics officials and athletes. They argue that they are an intrinsic part of London’s public transport system and should be allowed access to the lanes.

But their views have fallen on deaf Olympic ears.

Len Martin, vice chairman of United Cabbies, had said: 'We don't want to disrupt Londoners, what we want to do is to bring to the public's attention the plight of the London cab driver who is unable to bring a service to the Olympic Games during the Games.'

Transport for London said cabs were able to use some lanes to collect fares.

Three lanes northbound and two southbound were closed between junction 16 west of Northampton and junction 18 east of Rugby.

Eight
Javelin trains an hour will run between St Pancras and Stratford and 
Ebbsfleet International station in North Kent during the Olympics.

Between
11pm and 1.59am there will be 12 trains an hour, with a half-hourly 
shuttle between Stratford and St Pancras between 2am and 5am.

The service will run until Sunday August 12 and will operate for the Paralympics from Wednesday August 29 to Sunday September 9.

Southeastern
expects to transport 25,000 people an hour to and from Stratford. Those
with Games’ travelcards can use them on the Javelin service.

A
spokesman for Southeastern said the 7.04am had left late because the 
company had to get a replacement driver, as the booked driver was 
unwell.

She went on: 'We have drivers on standby for this reason; 99% of our trains arrived on time this morning.'

Network
Rail and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said a 
total of nearly 444,000 extra main line train seats were being provided 
today.

In all, four million seats were on offer, thanks to the running of extra services and longer trains.

Network
Rail said that at noon, 92 per cent of services were running to 
schedule across the network – though that still means about 1 in 12 were
late.

Late-night trains 
will run after tonight's opening ceremony.

For example, the last train 
from London Paddington to Oxford leaves at 2.17am and the last from 
Euston to Manchester at 2.30am.
