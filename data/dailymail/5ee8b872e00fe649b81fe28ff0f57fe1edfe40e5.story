Tarnished image: Rupert Murdoch apparently told his son to step down as chairman of News International, but then changed his mind

Rupert Murdoch told his son James that he should step down as chairman of News International at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in the summer, it has been alleged.

The 80-year-old media mogul apparently made the move at the instigation of his daughter, Elisabeth - but changed his mind after a sleepless night.

The revelation appears in Vanity Fair's December issue, due out today.

Writer Sarah Ellison - a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp - said Elisabeth initially persuaded her father to remove her brother from his top job because she thought he allowed the crisis to 'spin out of control.'

Ellison also writes that Murdoch's eldest four children - James, Elisabeth, Lachlan and Prudence - have been undergoing psychological counseling over who will succeed the aging tycoon to run the media conglomerate.

The article on the family's internal power struggle comes as James Murdoch, News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer and the son once tipped to inherit his father's powerful mantle, faces increasing pressure over his handling of the affair.

Elisabeth Murdoch is said to have urged 
her father to force her younger brother James to 'step aside' in July, 
just days after the closure of the News of the World.

According to Vanity Fair, Murdoch was 'open to the idea' at first because he had been at loggerheads with his son and told him, "Maybe you should go".'

Elisabeth also reportedly told her father that News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of The Sun and The News of the World, should resign along with the company's former chairman Les Hinton. Both stepped down a few days later.

The Vanity Fair article says: 'Elisabeth blamed her brother for allowing the phone-hacking crisis to spiral out of control. After the meeting, Elisabeth approached her father and urged him to take control of the situation.

'She said Brooks and Hinton needed to resign (they eventually did) and that James needed to take a leave.

'Rupert was open to the idea - he and James had been at odds for months. Elisabeth had been urging her father to step in.

'The next morning, Elisabeth, at her father’s suggestion, confronted James and said he should step aside and let Rupert handle the crisis moving forward. The suggestion infuriated James.

'Rupert summoned Brooks and told her she should take a leave. He called Hinton and asked him to come to London. Rupert then spoke to James and suggested that he take a leave.

‘Maybe you should go too,’ he said. But after a sleepless night he changed his mind,' added the Vanity Fair report.

The article claims that in February Murdoch considered stepping down himself and grooming James to take over.

'Lachlan, Prudence and Elisabeth had discussed the move extensively with James. The siblings had been in family counselling with a psychologist over the issue of succession,' says Vanity Fair.

'They told James that if they worked together as siblings they could help him and their father have a better relationship.

'Together the siblings agreed that James was the best-suited to be the heir apparent but they also agreed he had to stop being so aggressive and alienating in his public postures.'

The article also claims that Murdoch 'hated' his daughter's husband, public relations guru Matthew Freud.
