The new sheriff of a Wyoming county has banned his deputies from wearing cowboy hats and boots, a change that led one longtime deputy to retire rather than give up his Western attire.

Sublette County Sheriff Stephen Haskell imposed the new dress code across his patch that includes Pinedale, which True West magazine recently named one of its 'top ten' true Western towns.

Haskell is requiring deputies to wear black trousers, a tan shirt, black boots and a black ball cap, saying the change is for safety and uniformity.

Fond farewell: Cowboy boots and hats have been banned at one police office in Wyoming - the uniform change led Gene Bryson to retire last Friday after 28 years with the department

'I'm very much for the Western way of life and the look. And that's the way I dress,' Haskell told the Casper Star-Tribune.

'However, for a professional outfit . . . I like everybody to look the same. We are one team unified in one purpose. That is to do our job.'

Haskell, 53, who has worked in law enforcement for three years, also argues that cowboy boots are slippery on ice and cowboy hats can blow away in Wyoming's blustery wind.

The change led Deputy Gene Bryson to retire last Friday after 28 years with the department and about 40 years total in law enforcement. 

His uniform included a brown cowboy hat, brown cowboy boots and a leather vest in the summer or a wool vest in the winter. The uniform change is 'kind of the reason why I retired,' Bryson, 70, told the newspaper.

'I am not going to change. I've been here for 40-odd years in the sheriff's office, and I'm not going to go out and buy combat boots and throw my vest and hat away and say, 'This is the new me.'"

Bryson was born and raised on a ranch in Montana and has worked on ranches in Colorado and Wyoming. He went into law enforcement in 1974.

'And I've had a cowboy hat on since 19,' Bryson said. 'That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming.'

Bryson’s Old West look was so popular in town that tourists would often ask for pictures. The retiree now plans to spend more time with his wife and grandchildren.

He will also commit fully to his gun shop business in Marbleton, which he has run on a part-time basis for many years.

He fondly described his time in the forces as 'one hell of a ride.'
