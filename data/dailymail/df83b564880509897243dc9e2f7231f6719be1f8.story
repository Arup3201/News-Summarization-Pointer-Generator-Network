Ambitious plans for a ‘Boris Island’ airport were dealt a bitter blow today as a powerful all-party group of MPs urged ministers to reject the idea and instead expand Heathrow to three or even four runways.

As Europe’s busiest airport and the ‘jewel in the crown’ of international aviation, expansion at Heathrow is ‘long overdue’ and by far the best option after decades of dither by Governments of all complexions, they said.

The prospect of  expanding Heathrow by creating two additional runways two miles to the West – instead of one extra ‘third’ runway to the North- was put forward by Policy Exchange and CentreForum and has captured the interest and imagination of senior ministers, as well as MPs on the committee.

Grounded? An influential commons select committee has voted against plans for a 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames Estuary

Backers say it they would cost between £8billion and £12billion and be ready by  2030.

The MPs’ report notes: ’Relocating the runways in this way might result in less noise annoyance for residents under the current flight path, thus addressing the most politically significant objection to the expansion of Heathrow.’

But they also encouraged Gatwick to press ahead with plans for a second runway.

Today’s verdict by the influential Transport Select committee is uncompromisingly clear noting : ‘We conclude that a third runway at Heathrow is necessary,  but also suggest that a four-runway proposal may have merit.’

A brand new airport in the Thames 
Estuary to the East of London would be too expensive, impractical, 
harmful to wildlife and ‘not commercially viable’ without huge public 
subsidies, said the MPs.

The
report was agreed by a majority of the Committee with six voting in 
favour and just  one (Torbay Lib Dem Adrian Sanders MP) voting against, 
with  no abstentions.

The 
findings in the 124-page report  will infuriate residents and 
campaigners around  the West London airport as well as London Mayor 
Boris Johnson who supports a brand new airport in the Thames estuary 
already dubbed ‘Boris Island.’

But
it will delight airlines including the UK’s flagship carrier British 
Airways and the boss of its parent company Willie Walsh, as well 
business leaders in the capital.

The report comes as former CBI and Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies and his team on the Whitehall-appointed Airports Commission continue their investigation into airport capacity.

The commission is due to present an initial report by the end of this year and a final report in summer 2015 – after the next general election.

The report says MPs on the Transport Committee ‘have today rejected calls for a new hub airport east of London and urge the Government to permit the expansion of Heathrow where a third runway is long overdue.’  

The verdict was announced by Louise Ellman, chairman  of the House of Commons’ Transport Committee and Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside.

Launching the report of an inquiry that examined the UK Government’s Aviation Strategy, Mrs Ellman said: ’Heathrow – the UK’s only hub airport – has been short of capacity for a decade and is currently operating at full capacity.

‘We conclude that a third runway at Heathrow is necessary,  but also suggest that a four-runway proposal may have merit, especially if expanding to locate two new runways westwards from the current site could curb the noise experienced by people affected under the flight path.’

Rejecting the ‘Boris island’ plan for a brand new airport in the Thames Estuary, Mrs Ellman said:’ ‘Research we commissioned made plain that building an entirely new hub airport east of London could not be done without huge public investment in new ground transport infrastructure.

'Evidence to our inquiry also showed a substantial potential impact on wildlife habitat in the Thames estuary. ‘

She added:’The viability of an estuary hub airport would also require the closure of Heathrow – a course of action that would have unacceptable consequences for individuals, businesses in the vicinity of the existing airport and the local economy.’

MPs ‘looked closely’  at the three main options to increase UK hub airport capacity noting:’We conclude that adding new runways to expand a number of other existing airports will not, on its own, provide a long-term solution to the hub capacity problem.

We do however encourage Gatwick’s operator to develop a robust business case for their vision of a second runway.

‘And the third so-called Heathwick’ option was rejected as ‘uncompetetive’ with MPs noting:’We reject the notion of linking existing airports by high-speed rail to form a split-hub.’

The MPs report says Government failures to get a grip of the issue has been ‘immensely disappointing’  adding: ’Following decades of policy papers, inquiries, taskforces, and commissions, it is the lack of a long-term cross-party political strategy for aviation that is principally to blame for the very real danger that the UK could lose its status as an international hub for aviation.'

Continuing with a two-runway Heathrow hub  ‘unsustainable’ because  it is not adequate for the needs of the UK concluding ‘on the basis of the evidence we have heard we recommend that the Government allow Heathrow to expand.’

It adds:’Heathrow is the jewel in the crown of international aviation and we believe that a third runway is long overdue. British businesses are overwhelmingly in favour of this option.'

The report said it was ‘less than ideal’ that the Airports Commission was working to ‘a protracted timetable, with a final report not to be produced until after the 2015 general election’.

To avoid matters being again ‘kicked into the long grass’ it challenged the Commission to make a decision  ‘once and for all’ .

In December Willie Walsh, the feisty boss of British Airways' parent company told the MPs’ committee that cowardly  politicians have been ‘too afraid’ to take tough decisions on airport expansion and  that they would  live to regret ducking the  issue which has already put the UK ‘out of the game’ compered to its international rivals.

Today’s report also calls on the Government to establish a national scheme to ensure adequate compensation for people affected by noise from expansion at Heathrow.

It also calls for controversial Air Passenger Duty (APD)  airport departure tax  to be reduced or abolished if research suggests it is harmful  to the economy or Government revenue.

Chancellor George Osborne has admitted it is a revenue raiser not a ‘green’ tax as originally billed.

In the short-term the MPs said ministers should introduce an APD ‘tax holiday’ for a 12-month trial period for new services operating from airports outside south east England.

MPs also want assurances that the controversial  HS2 high-speed rail line rail network serves Heathrow.

A Department for Transport spokesman said the Government was ‘determined to find a lasting solution’  adding; ’The strength and range of opinions expressed on the issue shows precisely why we are right to ask Sir Howard Davies to conduct a detailed, independent review of all the options, based on the most up-to-date information.’

Labour Shadow Transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘Since David Cameron has asked Sir Howard Davies not to deliver his final report until 2015, it will be for the next government to decide on the way forward.’

Heathrow welcomed MPs’ recognition of the ‘unique importance’ of their airport to  the UK economy.

Councillor  Rodney Chambers, leader of Medway Council in Kent,  said: ‘This confirms what we've always known, and have campaigned loudly about  - that the Thames Estuary airport is a non-starter.’

British Airways said the report ‘backs up our view that a Thames Estuary airport is not a credible option’.

Jill Brady, Virgin Atlantic Director of External Affairs noted the ‘crippling lack of political consensus around the future of aviation’ and welcomed the findings as ‘a breath of fresh air’.

Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA) welcomed ‘some refreshingly pragmatic and straight forward cross-party thinking’ which   puts the ‘the national interest first.’

Corin Taylor, senior economic adviser at the Institute of Directors praised the ‘hugely positive recommendations on the future of air travel in the UK’ and said expanding Heathrow ‘by far the best option’ adding: ’We urge the Government to accept the committee’s recommendations.’

But Paul Kehoe, chief Executive of Birmingham Airport said the focus on a Third or even Fourth Heathrow runway was ‘ a missed opportunity’ as he published new research recommending more expansion in the regions: ’Britain’s great cities need great airports.’

London First’s chief executive Baroness Jo Valentine  said any solution will take years but  that in the meantime more flights were needed from Heathrow: ‘We have to make the existing airports work harder.’
