Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson spoke out about the death of his secret love child today as he took to the field amid a tremendous wave of support from fans and players on both sides of the NFL clash.

The running back vowed to play just two days after his unidentified 2-year-old son died, allegedly at the hands of his mother's abusive live-in boyfriend.

The football star, who first met his son at his hospital bed having only been informed of his paternity earlier this year, said he felt it was important he still perform on the field.

'I’m still hurt and feel the pain of 
life, but I’m able to function because of the peace and joy of knowing 
my loved ones are in a much better place,' he said

'I was set on it. I just look at things and I don't ask people to understand my mindset and how I think. Anything bad, I try to take good from it. That's the way I approach life in all situations. I never thought about not playing. It was all about just going out there and praying that I have the strength to get through and help my team. That was my focus.'

Fans held signs that read 'Stay Strong 28' and 'Prayers for Adrian,' and several teammates offered hugs and well wishes before the game.

'I just prayed and asked God to give me the strength just to get through the game, just play and focus,' Peterson said. 'And for the most part, I did.'

He took the field for Sunday’s match up against the Carolina Panthers to a roar from fans who had showed up early just to greet him.

Peterson declined to discuss the relationship he had with the boy, who lived with his mother in Sioux Falls.

The mother's boyfriend, Joseph Patterson, is charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery.

Vikings coach Leslie Frazier said he thought his star running back handled himself well during the trying circumstances.

'It's a difficult, difficult situation and there are a lot of people trying to support him within in the organization, his teammates as well,' Frazier said.

Panthers safety Mike Mitchell, who had two interceptions and a sack, sought out Peterson during the game to offer some words of encouragement.

Mitchell said he mentioned to the deeply religious Peterson the Bible verse Jeremiah 29:11 about God providing hope for the future.

'I told him that to keep that in his heart as he continues to take this challenge going forward,' Mitchell said.

Peterson said he is leaning on his teammates and family to help him through, and he will continue to look to the football field as a shelter, as he has throughout his life during the toughest of times.

'In life situations, and in football, you've got to continue to believe,' Peterson said.

'We've got to get everyone with that same mindset, to believe no matter what the circumstances.'

Peterson also pointed out that he played following the death of a brother several years ago.

Peterson has had tragedy peppered throughout his life. When he was seven, he saw his older brother die in a bike accident after being hit by a drunken driver.

For
Peterson's teenage years, his father was in prison. He grew up poor in 
east Texas. Shortly before the Minnesota Vikings drafted him in 2007, a 
half-brother, was shot and killed.

Long
before Peterson began running through the NFL record book, he learned 
to turn tragedy into fuel for an exceptional career.

'Things
that I go through, I've said a thousand times, it helps me play this 
game to a different level,'he said after practice, about an hour after 
the child's death.

'I'm able to kind of release a lot of my stress 
through this sport, so that's what I plan on doing.'

Twitter has been filled with public 
condolences for Peterson and his loved ones. From LeBron James to Barry 
Sanders to Josh Groban, his peers, opponents and admirers expressed 
their sadness and support.

'Praying
for you and your family. May God give you the strength,' tweeted New 
York Giants defensive end Justin Tuck, whose team plays the Vikings on 
October 21.

'He's
a wonderful human being,' said Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, who coached 
Peterson in college. 'He's a very faithful, strong, Christian guy that 
we all dearly, we all love him. We're all there for him. Incredibly 
tragic event. He's a great a kid, a great man, a great kid when I had 
him.'

Peterson had three children, including the unidentified two-year-old.

Peterson Jr, 3, showed up at training camp this year and posed for 
pictures after one practice with his dad. Peterson also has a daughter; 
he tweeted last month about how she teased him about Minnesota's loss 
that afternoon to Cleveland, they both live with their father.

'So
my daughter is laying here under me and just out the blue she says ... I
can't believe you lost to the Browns Daddy!' Peterson posted on 
September 22.
