Smiling with his arms around his three young children as his wife looks on, Benjamin Johnson III is the picture of a supportive husband and father.

And on Saturday, Mr Johnson made the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to save his children's lives, perishing in an early-morning fire after he ran back inside to save them.

But along with their father, nine-year-old Ben, eight-year-old Leslie and four-year-old Ryan all died in the blaze that took firefighters two hours to extinguish.

Only their mother, Christine Johnson, survived the deadly flames after escaping from a second-storey window onto the roof of their home in Orrington, Maine.

Cardboard boxes left inches from a wood-burning stove are being blamed as the cause of the blaze.

The fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace only adds to the tragedy of the situation.

A funeral will be held on Sunday, and the community is holding a bowling fundraiser on December 9 at the Family Fun and Hollywood Casino, where the family went hours before the tragedy.

'Christine was very moved by the support when I talked to her last night,' family friend Mike Marsh wrote on the Facebook page for the event.

'She is very grateful for the love 
and support she is getting and so amazed at how much love and support 
the bowling family is showing.'

The Bangor Daily News reports that 
when the fire department arrived on the scene, they tried to enter 
through a window but ruled the blaze too dangerous and were forced to 
pull back.

Tragic: Christine Johnson, 31, survived by climbing out a window but she realized that her husband and three children, including Leslie, four, 'went the wrong way'

Bucksport fire 
chief Craig Bowden said that the four victims were likely already dead 
when the responders got to the scene around 2.30am.

Neighbors Terri and Doug Winslow called the police when they heard Christine screaming and they called the fire department.

'We
jumped out of bed and saw the orange fire on the front of the 
house,' neighbor Terri Winslow told the Bangor Daily News. 'I called 911 while my husband jumped into some clothes.

'While I was on the phone with emergency, I opened the
window and hollered out to her that I heard her and she kept hollering 
to please help.

'(Christine) said that her husband and kids were in the house which I relayed to 911.

When
I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and she 
just kept saying "they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!"'

Horror: A fire at this rural wood home early on Saturday killed a father and his three children, while the childrens' mother escaped and was taken to a hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation

The bodies of the three children were found in a bedroom on the second floor while the father’s body was found at the top of the stairs nearby. Christine was on the roof when emergency workers arrived.

This fire - which is the deadliest fire in Maine in the past 20 years - is not the family’s first tragedy, as The Portland Press Herald reports that one of the couple’s son Thomas died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2007.  

Christine Johnson is still being treated for smoke inhalation at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and is fielding visits from friends as she plans the funerals for her husband and children.

'Ben was her soul, the kids were her soul, so I just don’t know how well she’s going to recover,' her friend Tabitha Robertson told the paper. 'It’s just been one thing after another for her.'

Deadly: Firefighting crews from Bangor and four other towns were called in after the fire was reported at around 2:30 a.m., and it took an hour to extinguish the blaze

Remainders: The husband was found at the top of the stairs on the second floor and the three children were found together in a second floor bedroom

The children attended Center Drive School where Principal Roy Allen described them as 'great kids, very nice kids.'

'This is just such a tragedy. It's going to be devastating for the kids because it's such a small school and everybody knows everybody,' Allen told the Bangor Daily News.

The Johnsons had just moved into the house in the rural town of Orrington six months ago. They were in the process of buying the house through a short sale, meaning that it would take months for the loan agreement would be finalized by the lender, JP Morgan Chase, in the coming months.

Once the sale was approved, they were planning on replacing the 46-year-old hot water furnace, which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater.

The Johnsons arrived home late Friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room.

Investigators found empty cardboard boxes - which were likely used as kindling to start the fire in the first place - just inches away from the stove. A container of lighter fluid was nearby as well, which added to the pace at which the fire spread.

Damage: The fire ravaged the house and caused part of the roof to collapse

Tragic end of a nice night: The family lit the fire to keep the house warm after returning home from a night at the local bowling lanes

Police are still investigating the fire, but their initial reports suggest that they did not have smoke alarms installed in the home.

One of the last people to see the husband and children alive was the owner of their local bowling center, Family Fun, who was in shock at the news of the fire.

‘The entire bowling center is in shock. It feels like he’s been here forever,’ owner Andy Meucci said of Benjamin Johnson.

Her work: Christine Johnson works from home and self published this novel over the summer

‘We were surprised he was only 30 because it seems like he’s been here so long. He started up with the Saturday morning youth league and did that for five or six years and has been in adult leagues ever since,’ Meucci told the Bangor Daily News.

Benjamin worked at Hollywood Casino in Bangor and Christine is a self-published author who released her first book ‘The Quest For The Enchanted Stone’ earlier this summer.

In her brief author bio, she describes herself as living happily in a small town in Maine with her husband of 10 years. She also says that she is the mother of four, including her son Thomas who died in 2007.

'I enjoy drawing, and have enough books in my house to start my own bookstore. I enjoy horseback riding, singing, and as strange as this sounds, yard work. I've travelled all over as an ex-military brat,' she wrote.

Friends and family remembered 
how the children had vivid imaginations, playing 'spies' with each other
at the house, where the family had moved just six months ago.

Ryan loved hot dogs and Disney shows,
while his big sister hoped to be a horse trainer or jockey when she 
grew up, and loved helping her mother in the kitchen.

Their big brother Benjamin shared 
many of his father's hobbies - building and bowling - and looked forward
to learning golf with his dad and grandfather.

Center Drive School remained open during the Veteran’s Day holiday Monday in order for the victim’s classmates to meet with grief counsellors that were available.

One of those students was Hatty May Hubler, whose mother Jennifer brought the third grader to meet with a counsellor because she was friends with Leslie.

'It's hard trying to come to terms with it. It comes in waves but the school is doing a good job for the students,' Ms Hubler said.

Any donations for Christine Johnson may be made at any People's United Bank branch, under the Johnson Family Fundraiser account.
