A train derailment in Louisiana has forced the evacuation of over 100 homes.

Over 20 cars from a Union Pacific freight train derailed Sunday afternoon just east of Lawtell, LA., resulting in the evacuation of all homes within a mile of the accident and the closure of area roads to protect against exposure to hazardous chemicals leaking from the wreck.

The train was carrying a variety of toxic chemicals including lubricant oil, Dodecanol, vinyl chloride and Lye.

Derailed: Over 20 cars came off the tracks, possibly leaking hazardous chemicals

The derailment, which happened just before 3:30pm Sunday, claimed between 23 and 26 of the train’s 76 total cars, according to KATC. Of those that derailed, 14 are carrying harmful or toxic substances. Of those 14, three are leaking – one is leaking lubricant oil, another is leaking Doecanol, and a third is leaking Lye.

‘The good news is that right now, there are no fatalities and no injuries,’ Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said during a press briefing near the site of the accident roughly 60 miles west of Baton Rouge, LA.

Closed: The road that parallels the train tracks has been closed until further notice

While Lubricant oil and Dodecanol – a tasteless, colorless alcohol – are relatively harmless, Lye is highly corrosive and poses an immediate danger.

‘The cars that derailed include lube oil and other products. There was some vinyl chloride on there," Union Pacific spokesperson Raquel Espinoza told KATC.

Two other cars carrying vinyl chloride – a highly toxic, flammable and carcinogenic substance – are damaged, but it is not clear if they are leaking.

‘Although it's not leaking at this moment, it does have signs of damage,’ Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal of the cars containing vinyl chloride, adding that the damage has to be assessed before residents can return home during a press briefing near the site of the accident.

From miles around: Emergency responders from all over the county responded to the wreck

‘Vinyl chloride is a colorless organic gas with a mild, sweet odor,’ according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Used in making plastics and vinyl, exposure to the toxin can result in symptoms ranging from irritation in the eyes and respiratory tract to liver problems, cancer, birth defects and reproductive problems, according to the government agency.

As a precaution, all 101 homes within a mile of the derailment have been evacuated, officials announced.

‘Anytime you have chemicals leaking into the environment, that's a serious issue,’ Jindal said. ‘Nobody knows the extent of the damage, we'll get that in the next 24 hours.’

Roads near the site are expected to be closed for at least two days, according to reports.

As many as 26 cars derailed, about half of them were carrying carcinogenic, caustic, corrosive, toxic chemicals
