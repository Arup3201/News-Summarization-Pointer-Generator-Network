A man is suspected of faking his own death after two of his mates found him working in a Queensland cafe, a coroner has found.

Matthew Shirvington, 28, was believed to have taken his life last June when his car was found facing Bengello Beach on the NSW south coast filled with empty beer and vodka bottles inside, along with a suicide note with the words 'I'm sorry'.

When police and search crews were unable to retrieve a body, an inquest into his death was launched.

Faked his own death: Matthew Shirvington, 28, pretended to commit suicide last June but was found working in a Queensland cafe by friends

But Deputy State Coroner Sharon Freund terminated the inquest of the Cooma resident after two of his school friends spotted him working in a cafe in Airlie Beach, in far north Queensland - more than 1,100 miles away from his home.

When his school friends called out to him at the Sidewalk Cafe Restaurant and Bar, Mr Shirvington fled.

A woman working at the cafe said 'Charlie' hadn't been back since.

'He hasn't worked here in quite some time,' she said.

'We did have a Charlie that worked here but I wasn't sure of his last name.'

Queensland Police have confirmed with the cafe owner that Mr Shirvington was working there under the alias of Charlie Thompson.

No one has seen him since.

NSW Police will now work with the missing persons unit to attempt to establish contact with him.
