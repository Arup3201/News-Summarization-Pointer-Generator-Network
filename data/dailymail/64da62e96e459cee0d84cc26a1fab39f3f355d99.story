Matt Henry will replace injured fast bowler Adam Milne in New Zealand's World Cup squad.

The International Cricket Council approved the switch on Monday after Henry's fellow seamer Milne hurt his heel in the Kiwis' weekend quarter-final win over the West Indies in Wellington.

Scans showed Milne would be unable to play any further part in the tournament and New Zealand have therefore brought 23-year-old Henry into their squad.
