The jailed doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden has been dealt another blow after death threats forced his lawyer to quit.

Campaigners for Dr Shakil Afridi claim Pakistan has pursued him on politicised charges ever since he took DNA from the terrorist leader, allowing the U.S. to shoot him dead.

Now Dr Afridi's lawyer has quit the case after receiving a 'final warning' from Islamic militants.

Vital: The U.S. has hailed Dr Shakil Afridi (pictured) as a hero for collecting Osama bin Laden's DNA from his remote hideout. But the doctor has been in Pakistani jails since he was stopped at the border days later

Campaign: Friends and supporters of Dr Afridi say he has been pursued by the Pakistani government because officials were embarrassed and angered by the killing of bin Laden. Left: his brother Jamil Afridi

'They have warned me to either 
quit the case or be ready to face the dire consequences,' said the lawyer, Samiullah Khan Afridi.

'My family and I are under severe threat.'

The
 U.S. has put intense pressure on Pakistan to free Dr Afridi, who is not
 related to his lawyer, despite the fact he has denied helping the CIA.

But the lawyer said this pressure had only made his situation worse.

Pakistan
 and the U.S. were locked in a diplomatic rift over the killing of bin 
Laden, because officials were angry at the Americans for carrying 
out the mission themselves on foreign soil.

Some
 U.S. figures, meanwhile, questioned how bin Laden had managed to hide 
for so long in plain sight and raised the possibility that he was 
sheltered by elements in the Pakistani forces.

Hiding in plain sight: The terrorist leader lived in this fortified compound, sending messages via couriers

Peaceful: A shepherd with goats near the hideout of the Al Qaeda leader, which was stormed in May 2011

The
 U.S. has hailed Dr Afridi as a hero, saying the doctor ran a fake 
vaccination programme which allowed forces to identify the Al Qaeda 
chief.

He was stopped at a 
border crossing days after U.S. Navy SEALS stormed bin Laden's Pakistan 
compound and shot him dead in May 2011.

Pakistan
 arrested him and jailed him for 33 years for treason - over charges 
which the authorities insisted were unrelated to the bin Laden case.

Terrorist: Osama bin Laden was shot dead

He was convicted of providing money and medical treatment to Islamic militants in Khyber 
tribal region.

But the claims were denied by both his family and militants, and a retrial was ordered.

In March this year a court in Pakistan 
reduced his sentence to 23 years on appeal.

While
 the appeal was ongoing, however, Dr Afridi faced what campaigners said 
was further persecution - when he was charged with the murder of one of 
his own patients in hospital..

It centred on the death of Suleman Afridi (no relation) in 2005 and was allegedly brought by the man's mother.

'She
 stated that he operated on her son at a hospital in Khyber Agency even 
though he was not a surgeon, and that caused (her son's) death,' one 
official said.

The lawyer's departure came after a suicide bombing killed five people yesterday in the north western city of Peshawar.

The
 blast targeted refugees who were standing in line on a football pitch 
waiting to register with the government, a police official said, and 
injured another 12 people.

In
 the Bajur tribal region on the Afghan border, meanwhile, two roadside 
bomb blasts killed a Pakistani soldier and wounded four yesterday.

No
 one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which are the 
latest in a string of bombings which have killed thousands of people.

Suicide bombing: A blast killed five people and injured 12, including the child pictured, as refugees from rebel fighting lined up on a football pitch in Peshawar yesterday to register their details with the government

Horror: Pakistani rescue workers try to remove the lifeless body of one man killed in Peshawar yesterday

Pakistan's Taliban have killed thousands in their fight to overthrow the government and install a harsh brand of Shariah law.

Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, has made 
negotiations with the militants a centerpiece of his government policy 
since he took office last summer, but no deal has been struck.

Cricketer
 turned politician Imran Khan, meanwhile, has accused the government of rigging the election which brought Sharif to power.

Khan's party held a rally yesterday in which he 
demanded the government sack members of the Pakistani election 
commission.

Khan announced that his party would keep on holding such rallies in
 various Pakistani cities until reforms ensured fair 
elections.
