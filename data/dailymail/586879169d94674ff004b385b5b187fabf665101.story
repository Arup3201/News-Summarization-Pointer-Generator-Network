A third video has emerged of the smiling Florida man believed to be the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria, showing him burning his US passport before delivering a haunting message.

The latest footage of Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha - a college drop out who blew himself up in May while detonating a truck full of explosives outside a restaurant in Syria - further demonstrates how intent he was to die for his cause.

It shows the American jihadi ripping, chewing and then setting fire to his American passport against a haunting soundtrack of Arabic music.

'You think you're safe where you are, in America or Britain or Indonesia or Jordan or China or Russie or Somalia or Africa?

Haunting: In the accompany video, Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha talks to the camera about how no one is safe

'You are not safe. I have one word to say ... we are coming for you. Mark my words.

'You think you killed Osama bin Laden? You sent him to paradise.'

'Just know that we are coming.'

This is not the first frightening footage of Abu-Salha.

In footage released by an al-Qaeda-linked group fighting in Syria recently, he was shown making a bomb and strapping it to his body.

'I want to rest in the afterlife, in heaven,' Abu-Slaha says in that video.

'There is nothing here, my heart is not resting here in this life.'

Blast: Abu-Salha is believed to have taken part in a mass suicide bombing that targeted the army in Syria in May

The 22-year-old, who once lived about 
130 miles from Miami, is believed to have been part of a mass suicide 
bombing on May 25 which targeted several army positions.

The Nusra Front, which released the video, claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives.

'Glorious is God, and thanks God, his is a grace from him,' Abu-Salha continues. 'When I came to Syria, I had nothing.

'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.'

The grinning geurilla is then shown making the bomb believed to have been in the truck Abu-SalhaÂ  and others drove as they stormed their target.

'Heaven is better,' he said in a previously-released video. 'When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation.'

The video was posted on jihadi websites. It corresponded with the Associated Press reporting about the attack and Abu-Salha.

All-American: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where he played youth league basketball

Opposition forces previously identified the American who carried out the bombing as Abu Hurayra al-Amriki and said he was a U.S. citizen. The name al-Amriki means 'the American' in Arabic.

It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abu-Salha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops.

The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions.

Abu-Salha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad.

He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami.

The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports.

But recent trips to Syria had meant federal officials were already keeping an eye on him, the New York Times reported.

Thousands of foreign fighters have come to Syria from around the world to fight against President Bashar Assad's forces after the uprising against his government began three years ago.

The war, which began in 2011, has since taken on strong sectarian overtones, pitting a Sunni-led insurgency that includes al-Qaeda-inspired extremist groups against a government dominated by Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

New path: After dropping out of college, Abu-Salha moved abroad

Syria's 
uprising began with peaceful protests in March 2011 but escalated into 
an armed revolt when government forces launched a sweeping crackdown on 
dissent.

The
 conflict has killed at least 170,000 people, nearly a third of them 
civilians, according to activists. Nearly 3 million Syrians have fled 
the country.

On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border, killing and wounding a number of people.

The Aleppo Media Center said the car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in the town of Azaz. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car blew up near a gas station in Azaz.

The Observatory said the blast killed at least four people and wounded several others. The AMC said it killed and wounded a number of people, without offering specific figures.

The Observatory and an Idlib-based activist who goes by the name of Asad Kanjo said another car blew up in the northern village of Atmeh near the Turkish border.

The Observatory said the blast killed two people. Kanjo said the blast occurred near a market and close to a children's hospital, though it was not affected.

The Observatory also said the Syrian troops recaptured the Shaer gas field in the central province of Homs a week after fighters from the Islamic State group captured it and killed dozens of soldiers.

Syrian state television confirmed that troops recaptured the field, saying that 'large numbers of Islamic State terrorists were wiped out.'

The Observatory said a missile shot down the helicopter Friday night over a neighborhood of Aleppo known as Camp Nairab. Camp Nairab is adjacent to the Nairab military airport southeast of the city, where government aircraft take off to carry out attacks in northern Syria.

Assad's forces use helicopters to drop barrel bombs - crude explosives that have killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction, especially in Aleppo.

The Observatory and an Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu Saeed Izzedine said the helicopter crash killed four people, including a child. The Observatory said three of the dead were the helicopter's crew members.

Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, has been the scene of heavy fighting since rebels seized part of the city in 2012.

The Observatory also reported Saturday that the number of soldiers killed over the past few days in a northern military base in Raqqa that was overrun by the extremist Islamic State group has risen to 85. It said the fate of 200 others was still unknown.

The monitoring group, which relies on a network of activists inside the country, said Islamic State fighters have executed and paraded the bodies of 'tens' of soldiers in Raqqa, the only provincial capital in rebel hands.

Amateur videos posted online by activists showed more than a dozen beheaded bodies in a busy square said to be in Raqqa.

Some of the heads were placed on a nearby fence, where at least two headless bodies were crucified. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events.
