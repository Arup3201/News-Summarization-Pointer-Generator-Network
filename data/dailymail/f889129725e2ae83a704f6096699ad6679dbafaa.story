A 75-year-old widow has been dealt a double blow after losing her wedding ring to thieves while attending her husband's wake.

Dorothy Bafaloukos from Tempe, Arizona, told CBS News that burglars broke in through her bedroom window on Monday evening and went straight for her jewelry box.

The senior believes that it was a targeted attack, as the timings of her husband Bill's visitation were listed in a public obituary.

'I should have had somebody stay here, and all of our neighbors came to the mortuary.'

The robbers also made off Mr Bafaloukos' gold wedding band and a small cross he had bought for Mrs Bafaloukos during a vacation to Greece.

Pieces of less valuable costume jewelry were among the other items to go missing.

Mr Bafaloukos died on February 26 at home aged 79. 

The cause of death was not mentioned.

The longtime restaurateur was born in Greece and moved to the U.S. in the mid-Fifties where he met his wife. 

In retirement the Bafaloukos' traveled the world together, 

The couple were married for 55 years before Mr Bafaloukos passed away late last month.

Mrs Bafaloukos said the burglars cut a hole in her window screen before forcing open the lock.

Authorities are currently investigating the incident. 

Anyone with information on the crime is asked to call local police.
