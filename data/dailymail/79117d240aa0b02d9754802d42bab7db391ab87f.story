Stiliyan Petrov has admitted he is lucky to be alive after speaking for the first time about his battle with leukaemia.

In an emotional address at Aston Villa’s training ground, the former Bulgaria skipper said he realised how fortunate he was after learning more about the disease.

The Villa captain, 33, is now in remission from the cancer following 13 months’ treatment. He has come through chemotherapy and now has to take tablets for the next two years.

On the road back: Stiliyan Petrov says he is lucky to be alive after his battle with leukaemia

After being told of his condition when
routine blood tests flagged up a problem, Petrov worked overtime to get
himself in peak condition. And it seems as though his industry has paid
off, although he did not hide his relief at having come through a 
difficult 12 months.

‘I have finished all of the 
high-intensity treatment,’ he said. ‘From now on I’ll be on the softer 
one. It’s been a very, very long year. I had my hard moments but I had 
good moments as well.

‘I can say I’m lucky because some 
people with this disease will die very quickly and I managed to keep 
battling and still be here, still standing. It’s really good, that’s a 
great thing.

‘And now, after all of this, I can go back to a normal life. I can start doing things that I couldn’t do in the last year.’

Petrov played his last game for the 
club in a 3-0 defeat at Arsenal in March 2012. He complained of feeling 
lethargic afterwards and was given the diagnosis a few weeks later after
tests.

As he had the acute form of the 
illness, medics wanted to begin treatment immediately, his chances of 
survival rated at 50-50. But he has been in remission since the start of
the season.

‘At the start I thought it was just a 
cold, nothing serious — just something normal,’ he said. ‘When I was 
told what exactly the diagnosis was I was a little bit shocked but I 
accepted it and just wanted to start the treatment straight away. My 
doctor, Richard Lovell, told me quickly that I had to start treatment. I
knew I couldn’t waste time and I had to make decisions quickly.

‘I didn’t know anything about the 
disease when it happened. I didn’t know anything about the treatment, 
how long it would go on for, what would happen.

‘I thought it was dragging on. I kept 
thinking, “When is this going to finish?” but with a lot of support and 
patience from friends and family, I managed to pull through.’

Petrov said he had been humbled by the
reaction from supporters, not just from Villa and his former club 
Celtic, but across Britain.

Villa owner Randy Lerner has visited 
Petrov on several occasions and chief executive Paul Faulkner also 
showed the human face of the club by constantly travelling to and from 
London in the early stages to provide his support.

The fans’ backing has manifested 
itself in a minute’s applause in the 19th minute — Petrov wore the No 19 shirt — a gesture that has received almost universal backing.

‘It’s really funny how something like 
this can unite people,’ he said. ‘It’s a strange feeling but people from
all sides have been united and even teams who come to Villa Park, their
fans have joined in the minute’s applause as well.

‘It’s great to see something like 
that. I hope everyone can appreciate how important it is that if 
something were to go wrong for a player or a fan that they can give them
support the way they’ve supported me.

‘I don’t know how I can thank the 
fans. Some people go through these diseases on their own while I have 
had the support of millions around the world.’

Thoughts: Tributes to Petrov were displayed by teams around the Premier League

Petrov hopes to start his own 
foundation in due course. Lerner has instructed the midfielder to make sure he is recovered properly before any future position
at the club is discussed. Such is the player’s popularity that an 
honorary position is likely to be a formality.

‘I’m going to live my life,’ Petrov 
added. ‘Sometimes people feel sorry for you. I’m  just going to keep 
going and try to start picking up some work now and then.

First of all I’m going to spend some 
time with my family, show them that things are back to normal and feel a
bit more  comfortable. The kids especially have really missed me a lot 
and they’re happy that I’m home. But most of all I want to get my life 
back.’
