A financial adviser was jailed for life yesterday for beating to death a client he had robbed of £350,000.

David Jeffs, 36, resorted to  murder to cover his tracks when Roberto Troyan, 63, realised his bank accounts had been emptied.

Jeffs spent the money on drugs, sports cars and luxury holidays and even treated himself to a £20,000 stag night at a stripclub.

Murderer: David Jeffs, left, swindled his client Roberto Troyan, right, out of £343,000 and then killed him. He was jailed for life yesterday

Following the murder at Mr Troyan’s 
Mayfair flat, Jeffs tried to put police off the scent by leaving 
messages on his victim’s phone and buying identical clothes to the 
blood-stained ones he was forced to dump.

But he was brought to justice when forensic scientists found a tiny drop of Mr Troyan’s blood in his briefcase.

Mr
Troyan became a multi-millionaire following the death in 2005 of his 
civil partner, Anthony Feldman, an architect whose clients included 
Princess Michael of Kent. The pair were a fixture on the London party 
circuit and friends said they knew ‘everyone who was anyone’.

Mr
Feldman’s death saw Mr Troyan fall victim to drink and drugs – and 
Jeffs being hired to look after his assets.

Instead of safeguarding his 
client’s future, Jeffs treated him as a ‘personal piggy bank’ and as a 
fund to cover his addiction to cocaine and ecstasy.

He bought two Lotus 
sports cars, together worth more than £70,000, and amassed a collection 
of electric guitars. He dined at London’s finest restaurants, splashed 
out on hospitality packages at rugby and polo matches and travelled to 
Mauritius, Ibiza and Las Vegas.

Just
weeks before the murder, Jeffs used his victim’s cash to pay for a trip
to Center Parcs for himself, his wife and his six-year-old son 
from his first marriage.

But by the time of the killing he had less than £6 in his bank account and owed the taxman £200,000.

Mr Troyan was found in a pool of blood in his kitchen by his maid, Davey Aganon, in March, Southwark Crown Court heard.

His
head injuries were so grave that police initially believed he had been 
shot. There was no sign of forced entry or a murder weapon and  nothing 
had been stolen.

That day 
Jeffs had arranged a meeting for the pair to visit a bank. CCTV caught 
the killer – wearing gloves and carrying the briefcase – visiting a pub 
before going to Mr Troyan’s home. There he called his victim’s phone 
three times, leaving a message saying he had missed him.

It
was an attempt to cover his tracks for the murder, following which he 
travelled to Surrey to pick up a new Lotus.

The police investigation 
found that he obtained blank cheques from Mr Troyan, supposedly for 
investments, but which he cashed himself between March 2010 and February
2012. Jeffs, from Nottingham, claimed the huge payments were his fees.

He
mouthed ‘I love you’ at his blonde wife Cheri, 30, after he was jailed 
for a minimum term of 24 years yesterday.

The teacher, who he had wed at
a £15,000 ceremony a few months before the murder, stood by him 
throughout his trial, which ended with the jury convicting him of murder
and fraud.

Passing 
sentence, Mr Justice  Rabinder Singh QC said Jeffs was a smooth talker 
who creamed off his victim’s savings to fund a greedy and extravagant 
lifestyle.
