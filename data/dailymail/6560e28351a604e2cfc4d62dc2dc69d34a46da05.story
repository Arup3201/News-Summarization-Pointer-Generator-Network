The UK Government has announced plans to provide £60 million for a revolutionary new rocket engine capable of taking people to Earth's 
stratosphere in just 15 minutes.

The engine is called Sabre, which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, and was built by British firm Reaction Engines.

Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' 
called Skylon.

The Oxfordshire-based company also add that at these speeds, a plane could theoretically travel from the U.S to Australia in under five hours.

David Willetts, minister for 
universities and science, said the investment in Sabre would provide support at a 'crucial stage' to 
allow a full-scale prototype to be built.

'We’re investing £60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well,' Willetts told Radio Five Live.

'But we’re backing this because it’s technology that has been tested in the lab, it’s been assessed by outside experts as right in principle.

'Now it needs to be built on a full-scale prototype before it can get commercial.

'We think it’s right to support it through that crucial stage.

Modern-day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they can't 'breathe' oxygen.

Oxygen helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion.

Reaction Engine's Sabre design uses a system of pipes, filled with 
helium.

The air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine.

Once in space, the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode.

This means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites, for example.

Alan Bond, founder of Reaction Engines, told International Business Times: 'Rockets are stuck in a rut. The weight problem means it 
costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite.

'The basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high 
speed it instantly heats up to 1,000C - which is unmanageably hot.

'The challenge was to cool it back down to 140C in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine.'

Bond continued: '[Sabre] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply, to build space
stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to 
earth. We could even construct spaceships for missions to other 
planets.'

'That’s where too many great British ideas in the past have failed.'

Willetts is expected reveal details of the investment at this week's UK Space Conference in Glasgow.

Skylon is likely to be viewed a competitior to Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic business, in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights.

Sir Branson and his Virgin Galactic company offer trips into 
space, that include six minutes of weightlessness, for around £121,000.

Skylon is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper, but has not announced any prices. 

Figures from the company believe the Skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent.

The Sabre engine has taken part in 100 successful test runs and its design was recently validated by the European Space Agency to validate the design.
