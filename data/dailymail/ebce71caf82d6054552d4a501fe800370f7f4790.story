Gerard Depardieu said he had 'no choice' but to kill the creatures which had blocked a vehicle in which he was a passenger while on a tour of Burkina Faso

Hell-raising French actor Gerard Depardieu has admitted he shot two lions on a trip to Africa - then ate them.

The 65-year-old said he was forced to kill the animals after the creatures had blocked a vehicle in which he was a passenger.

'We broke down on a track in the bush, in Burkina Faso,' said Mr Depardieu. 'The two lions waited in front of us and wouldn't move. 

'Hours passed, and we couldn't get out of the car, the African driver was very afraid.

'We had no choice; we had to shoot them,' said Mr Depardieu, referring to the lions. Asked directly if they were then eaten, he replied: 'Yes'.

Mr Depardieu first mentioned his hunting expedition in September, telling So Film magazine: 'I killed two lions once, and I understand why the lion is the king of the jungle. In legitimate self-defence.

'Imagine you're driving and your engine breaks down. You get out, and in your way are these animals. So you shoot, just to scare them. They don't move. I wasn't there for hunting. I was in Africa for Africa.'

Mr Depardieu, who has had bypass surgery five times, also explained the reason for so much of his bad behaviour, saying: 'When I'm bored, I drink.

'Apart from occasional compulsory moments of abstinence. After undergoing bypass surgery and also because of cholesterol and stuff, I have to be careful.'

In his latest interview - which appears in the Independent Magazine - Mr Depardieu also discussed the 2011 incident when he was thrown off an Air France flight for urinating in an aisle.

'I have lots of friends in the UK. And in Ireland. Where incidentally I recently p****d in a plane,' he said.

'There was this air hostess a little depressive, and I urgently wanted a p**s.

The Green Card star said he was not in Burkina Faso on a hunting expedition, but was 'in Africa for Africa'

'We'd been delayed 45 minutes, there were seven planes in front of us, and the hostess blocked me with her foot, so I p****d in a bottle. Luckily all the police at Dublin airport know me.'

Last month, Mr Depardieu shocked an audience at what was meant to be a solemn First World War commemoration by turning up 'scandalously drunk'.

The Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac star was due to read out poetry by the French poet-singer known as Barbara - who survived France's wartime Holocaust - at the event in Brussels.

But within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Mr Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language.

Mr Depardieu took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the very rich, and now mainly lives in Russia and Belgium.
