Singer Joss Stone has joined soldiers at the dawn-till-dusk Cenotaph vigil, which marks the start of this year's Poppy Appeal.

The soul singer was among the first to take part in 'The Watch' in central London this morning and will be joined by members of the public and the British Armed Forces throughout the day, until sunset.

It was inspired by images of the repatriation of the Unknown Soldier in 1920, when guards kept a vigil at the coffin as a mark of respect.

Remembrance: David Cameron buys a poppy from members of the armed services at Downing Street today

As well as marking the launch of the Royal British Legion's (RBL) annual fundraising campaign, the watch also coincides with the centenary year of the outbreak of the First World War. 

Speaking at the start of her shift, Ms Stone, 27, said: 'There isn't one war that is more horrific than another. These men are incredibly brave and a lot of them have laid down their lives so that we can live in a peaceful environment.

'It's important for younger people to realise this because we haven't seen it (war).

'I'm a couple years off of 30 and I've never seen war. Hopefully, my children will never see war in our homes.

Inspiration: The notion came from images of the repatriation of the Unknown Soldier in 1920, when guards kept a vigil at the coffin as a mark of respect

'The important thing - is it to remember or is it to be educated by it?'

She was joined by former Royal Marine Commando Pete Dunning who lost both his legs when he was struck by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2008 for the sunrise shift, which started at 7.36am.

Mr Dunning, 29, from Wallasey in Merseyside, said: 'I'm honoured to be a part of this historic event. The RBL is the nation's custodian of remembrance and this is a great way for anyone, whether they have served or not, to remember a loved one and celebrate our armed forces.

'The support that the Legion has offered me since my accident has been great. They are helping me to live my life as best I can by making my day-to-day living easier."

Teenage cadet Kamil Cesarz, 18, from Ealing, west London, who stood at another corner of the memorial with Mr Dunning and pop star Stone, said: 'Being asked to take part in the watch is especially important to me. 

'To be asked to represent 'the future' of the armed forces makes me extremely proud.'

Career: David Bower served in the Scots Guard as a senior tailor and on leaving the army the Royal British Legion helped him become a London taxi driver by finding his knowledge exam

Wreaths: Corporal Brian Stokes is one of the many servicemen that will guard the Cenotaph until sunset today

Several supporters, including military personnel, will take turns on shift in the sunrise-to-sunset event, expected to last until around 6pm this evening. 

Stone has also teamed up with guitarist Jeff Beck to record this year's official charity single, No Man's Land (Green Fields of France) - due for release on November 3.

Standing by the Cenotaph this morning, she clutched a photo of her great-great-grandfather Private Alfred Ernest Stenning, who fought and died in the First World War.

She added: 'After singing the song No Man's Land, everything that I thought got bigger and bigger.

'The lyrics in it, the song speaks of 'do you have a wife, or a sweetheart?' That really got me. It brings it closer to home.'

Poppy Appeal: Prime Minister David Cameron launches this year's fundraising campaign outside Number 10

Honour: Around 45 million poppies will be distributed by the Royal British Legion as part of this year's campaign

It is estimated that around 45 million poppies will be distributed by the Royal British Legion and its supporters as part of this year's campaign.

The key message of this year's Poppy Appeal is 'Live On - to the memory of the fallen and the future of the living.'

A major art installation has also been installed at the Tower of London, which has seen the famous dry moat adorned with 888,246 poppies - one for each British and Colonial fatality during the war.

Poppies: Joss Stone recorded the video for No Man's Land (Green Fields of France) at the Tower of London

The visual commemoration, entitled 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red', has been installed for the First World War Centenary with each poppy being sold for £25 with money going to charity.

The proceeds are to be divided between the Royal British Legion as well as the Confederation of Service Charities (COBSEO), Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help for Heroes and SSAFA (formerly the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association).

Stone and Beck recorded the video for their charity single among the poppies at the Tower of London and it was also visited by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh recently.

Richard Carter was born just after the outbreak of the First World War and is celebrating his 100th birthday

A Poppy Appeal organiser, who was born only a few months after the outbreak of the First World War is celebrating his 100th birthday.

It falls in the same week the Royal British Legion launched its appeal for the centenary year of the conflict.

Richard Carter can still remember his half-brother returning home from the war which first introduced the poppy as a national symbol of remembrance.

'It was 1918, and my mother said there was someone at the door for me,' said Mr Carter.

'There was a man there in khaki with a teddy bear. He said he was my brother. He’d been in Gallipoli and was one of my three half-brothers who fought in the war.

'One of my other brothers had been killed on HMS Hampshire in the Orkneys.'

During the Second World War, Mr Carter was an anti-aircraft gunner and served in Europe. 

After the war, he moved to Anglesey, Wales, having met his wife while stationed on the island during the conflict.

He said: 'In those days, there was no electric, no gas and no rubbish collection, and we grew our own food. We rented a cottage for three shillings a week. The toilet was at the bottom of the garden.'

But Mr Carter says wartime rationing played its part in getting him to his milestone birthday.

'The war years were the healthiest years we had in this country,' he said.

'The diet kept us all fit and healthy.'

Mr Carter, a former printer, became involved with the Royal British Legion after his retirement at the age of 80.

He said: 'I was at a loss for something to do, and thought I would do a bit of good for somebody else for a change. I’ve kept it going ever since.'

Mr Carter used to ride around the local area on his bike to collect donations and now his daughter has now taken over some of the work on his behalf.

He celebrated with his family and other local volunteers in Llanfairpwll, Anglesey, ahead of his 100th birthday on Sunday.

Mr Carter, who has two daughters, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, was also honoured for his 20 years of service with the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal.
