One in three people agree with Nigel Farage that using the words ‘chinky’ and ‘poofter’ is normal, a new polls has revealed.

But the Ukip leader is still in a minority – with just under half of voters insisting the terms are racist and homophobic.

It comes after Mr Farage last week defended former Ukip candidate Kerry Smith as a ‘council house boy’ who ‘talks in a way a lot of people from that background do’ after he was caught on tape making a series of derogatory remarks.

Mr Farage said Mr Smith (right) was not suitable to be a Ukip candidate, but was only speaking like people outside 'snobbish' London

But a YouGov poll for the Sun showed 49 per cent found ‘chinky’ offensive – while 36 per cent did not. Six out of 10 found ‘poofter’ offensive – compared to just over a quarter who did not.

The councillor made a string of comments, including a reference to a ‘chinky bird’, mocking ‘poofters’ and making jokes about shooting peasants.

Mr Farage initially refused to fire Mr Smith, who had been chosen to stand for the party in South Basildon and East Thurrock, but the candidate stood down by mutual consent on Monday.

When asked about Mr Smith’s behaviour last week, the Ukip leader claimed he had meant no ‘malice’ with the remarks.

He said: ‘I’m a bit sad because Kerry Smith is a rough diamond, a council house boy from the East End of London, left school early, and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do.’ 

Mr Farage added: ‘If you and your mates are going out for a Chinese what do you say you are going for?’

Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments

Sex education policy confusion

Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding 

Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' 

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration.'

General secretary sex scandal 

Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it.

Rate an immigrant game

Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game. 

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments 

Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters'' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.

When challenged about whether he would use the word ‘chinky’, he said: ‘No. A lot of people would ... I don’t think I’ve ever used that word. 

'The point is this – I feel a bit sorry for Kerry Smith because he’s a genuine fella.

‘I think even the “pooftah” comment ... the next sentence he was saying how good the candidate was and the fact he was gay would be an asset to the party.’

Mr Smith, a Ukip councillor on both Essex County Council and Basildon District Council, received a storm of criticism claiming he was racist and homophobic over the comments in a leaked phone call.

But Mr Farage insisted he had endured a ‘tough time’.

‘I think we are very snobbish in London about condemning people, perhaps for the colloquial language they use, particularly if it’s not meant with really unpleasant intent,’ he told LBC Radio.

He said Mr Smith had ‘used language that Del Boy used to use on Only Fools and Horses and nobody objected then’.

‘However, he is not suitable to be a parliamentary candidate,’ Mr Farage added. But Labour MP Madeleine Moon, vice-chairman of the All Party Group on China, said the Ukip leader ‘doesn’t get it’. 

She added: ‘Chinese people in this country will be deeply offended ... it’s not OK for a leading figure to say people can call Chinese people in their communities this offensive word. How dare he?’

The comments emerged during a torrid few weeks for Ukip after Mark Reckless, its latest MP, suggested on television that the party would like to see migrants who have been settled in Britain for years repatriated.

Then the party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, was suspended over claims he had behaved inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, who also stood down. 

Days later, recorded phone calls emerged in which Mr Smith called members of a Ukip-linked Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender group ‘f****** disgusting’ and ‘old pooftahs’. He then referred to a woman with a Chinese name as a ‘chinky bird’.

He also mocked Ukip’s Chigwell candidate Lucy Bostick for her leaflets, saying she should ask residents of the upmarket area if they wanted to ‘hunt peasants’ with shotguns.

Mr Smith suggested he had been taking strong painkillers for a back injury at the time of the phone calls. But Mr Farage tried to laugh off this excuse, saying: ‘I haven’t found sedatives have had that effect on me.’
