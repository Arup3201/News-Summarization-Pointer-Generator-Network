FBI agents created a fake news story mimicking The Seattle Times web page and used it to capture a suspect in a series of bomb threats there in 2007.

The agents created a fake Associated Press story and posted in on a bogus website 'in the style of The Seattle Times,' the newspaper said.

The piece was about a series of bomb threats being called into Timberline High School in Lacey, located an hour south of Seattle.

Police there had asked the FBI to help them find the suspect after the school had to be evacuated twice after a number of threats were called in.

FBI agents baited the story with tracking software that reveals the location of a person who clicks on it.

Then they sent it to the suspect's MySpace account — and eventually arrested an unnamed juvenile on June 14, 2007.

The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco.

Seattle Times Editor Kathy Best was furious.

'We are outraged that the FBI, with the apparent assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, misappropriated the name of The Seattle Times to secretly install spyware on the computer of a crime suspect,' Best told the newspaper.

'Not only does that cross a line, it erases it.'

'Our reputation and our ability to do our job as a government watchdog are based on trust,' she added. 'Nothing is more fundamental to that trust than our independence — from law enforcement, from government, from corporations and from all other special interests.

'The FBI’s actions, taken without our knowledge, traded on our reputation and put it at peril.'
