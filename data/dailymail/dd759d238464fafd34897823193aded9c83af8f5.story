Teacher Priscilla Davo Ortego has been suspended amid allegations she sellotaped children's mouths closed

The teacher accused of Sellotaping over the mouths of a class of ten-year-olds to keep them quiet says was a ‘game’ that the youngsters suggested and enjoyed.

Priscilla Davo is said to be ‘devastated’ by the furore following the incident.

She has been suspended from teaching Spanish and art while Danesfield Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, investigates parents’ complaints that their children had struggled to breathe and hurt their lips when removing the tape.

The 27-year-old Spanish-born teacher has not spoken publicly about the incident, but boyfriend Ivan Martin Linan said the claim that she taped the children’s mouths shut against their wishes ‘couldn’t be further from the truth’.

‘She told me she was trying to relax the children with music before asking them to draw themselves and to do so he told them they couldn’t speak,’ he said.

‘She said the idea of the Sellotape was one the children came up with as a way of reminding them they couldn’t speak, that they were laughing and enjoying themselves.’

She is said to have left the lesson in good spirits thinking the class had gone well, and been surprised and appalled when parents contacted the school to complain.

Parents claimed that some of the children ripped the tape off because they were struggling to breathe, while other were left with bleeding lips when the tape was removed, and several said they were scared about returning to school.

The Year 6 pupils said Miss Ortega imposed the punishment on Monday because they were making too much noise while playing a game of blind man’s bluff.

The incident is now the subject of a ‘thorough’ investigation by the school, and Miss Davo, who now lives in Somerset, has not spoken publicly about her side of the story.

But speaking from his home in Spain, Miss Davo’s boyfriend Ivan Martin Linan, told the Mail: ‘She’s absolutely devastated at what’s happened.

‘She breaks down in tears whenever she speaks about it. She can’t believe what’s happened.

‘The accusation that she taped the children’s mouths shut against their wishes and hurt them couldn’t be further from the truth.

‘It was just a game during an art class.’

He continued: ‘She told me she was trying to relax the children with music before asking them to draw themselves and to do so she told them they couldn’t speak and had to express themselves with signs to each other.

‘She said the idea of the Sellotape was one the children came up with as a way of reminding them they couldn’t speak, that they were laughing and enjoying themselves and when the tape fell off they’d ask her to put more on.

‘She and the kids ended the class as happy as normal and that was it as far as she was concerned.’He went on: ‘The first she knew of any problem was the following day when a teacher told her she was going to substitute her in her following class and she was informed the school had complaints from parents.

‘She’s shocked because she’s seen photos of children complaining about what happened and says they’re the ones who were enjoying themselves the most.’

Speaking from the village of Huetor-Santillan near Granada, in Southern Spain, Mr Linan said: ‘Staff have been very supportive of her and told her not to worry and it’s best she’s away from school for the time being.

‘You’d understand it if she had done something wrong and made a mistake.

The teacher has now been suspended and the school has launched an investigation

‘But the case is that she hasn’t. It’s total madness.

‘It was just a game. She’s taking advice from a teachers’ association about her future at the moment.

‘She doesn’t want to return to Spain just now in case that’s misinterpreted.

‘But at the same time she’s fretting about how she can face some of the children after everything that’s been said about her.’

He said of Miss Davo, who has been battling cancer and recently received chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment: ‘She loves her job and she loves being around children.

‘Priscila’s the last person you’d have expected something like this to happen to.

‘Her conscience is clean.’The teacher’s uncle Enrique Ortega added: ‘Priscila’s been totally maligned.

‘I’m proud to be her uncle. She’s one of the nicest young women you could ever hope to meet.

‘She’s told her mum in a phone call it was just a game and the children were laughing and joking.‘We just hope the truth comes out as soon as possible and she’s allowed to get back to working with children as soon as possible which is what she loves.

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they had spoken to one family but added that they would not be taking any further action

‘The last few months have been very difficult for her. Being falsely accused like this is the last thing she needed.’

Miss Ortega, who is said to speak excellent English, worked as a nanny in London from November 2010 to June 2011 before returning to her native country to complete a Master’s in secondary education.

Having completed a month-long placement at Danesfield primary in 2012, she began working at the school full-time in January.

She wrote in May last year her joy at getting a job at the school.

‘Now for sure, next school year, I will be an art and Spanish teacher in Danesfield School in pretty Sommerset (sic)! A bit nervous but happy,’ she said on Facebook.

Headteacher Ian Bradbury said on Tuesday after the initial complaints emerged: ‘We take all allegations seriously. The well-being of our children is of vital importance to us.

‘An incident happened in a lesson on Monday. Following that incident, I have suspended the teacher involved until a full and thorough investigation has taken place.’
