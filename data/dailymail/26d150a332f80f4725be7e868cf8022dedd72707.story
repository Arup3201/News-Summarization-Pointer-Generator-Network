Rene Meulensteen has hit back at David Moyes and accused the former Manchester United manager of misleading the club’s fans over his departure last summer.

Meulensteen left United following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and Moyes told Sportsmail's Matt Lawton on Sunday that the revered first-team coach opted not to stay on despite an offer from Moyes.

'I was criticised for getting rid of Rene Meulensteen but I asked him to stay,' Moyes said, but the Dutchman has claimed that the Scot offered him a much different role to what he had enjoyed under Ferguson.

Meulensteen told talkSPORT on Monday morning: 'He says he asked me to stay but he didn’t say what he then said after that.

'He said, "Well, I would like you to stay, I know how important you have been for the club and what you have done for the club, but I am going to do it all myself".

'So, it was then, "OK, what is the reason for me to stay?"

Sidelined: The Dutchman spent a total of 11 years during two spells on Manchester United's coaching staff 

'That has not been documented and that is why you get all these wrong, mixed messages about why I didn’t stay.

'We had two massive meetings. Yes, there was an element he would like me to stay but, on the other hand, he said, "Everything you did, I am going to do myself".

'So, after being there for five years with Alex Ferguson, being an integral part in training, planning, executing and the whole lot, suddenly you have been sidelined.'

Meulensteen has since managed Anzhi Makhachkala an Fulham but is currently unemployed.
