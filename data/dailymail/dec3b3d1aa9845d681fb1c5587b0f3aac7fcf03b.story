Stamp duty is distorting Britain’s housing market by pushing up property prices and urgently needs to be reformed, experts said yesterday.

The warning came as estate agents painted a bleak picture of a housing market that is being crippled by the lack of homes available to buy.

The average agency has just 42 homes to sell – down by a quarter since September and the smallest number for ten years. Stamp duty, which is paid by the purchaser, is so cripplingly expensive for homebuyers that many decide to extend their current home, rather than sell up and move. The resulting lack of homes on the market is pushing up prices.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the leading economic forecaster, said stamp duty is ‘a strong contender for the UK’s worst-designed tax’, and described the way it is charged as ‘perverse’.

Dominic Raab, a leading Tory MP, said it ‘warps the market’ and described it as a ‘vindictive stealth tax on the middle classes’. He added that the ‘cliff edge’ nature of its thresholds was ‘particularly absurd’.

Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. Now it is charged at one per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, three per cent up to £500,000, rising to a maximum of seven per cent on homes of more than £2million.

Many families decide it is cheaper to extend their current home than buy a new home because they want to avoid a hefty stamp duty bill.

As a result, the average home owner now moves once every 22 years, compared to once every eight in the 1980s, according to research by property firm Hometrack.

A Council of Mortgage Lenders spokesman said: ‘Some stamp duty liabilities now look sufficiently large to discourage some people from buying and selling, regardless of whether their accommodation needs are growing or contracting.

‘As a result, the UK may suffer the effects of an increasingly inefficient use of the existing stock. Larger dwellings will be disproportionately in the hands of the elderly – under-occupied and perhaps not maintained as well as they should be.’

Homebuyers will pay a record-breaking £10.1billion in stamp duty during this tax year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Government’s independent forecaster. Between 2013/14 and 2018/19, it expects the total amount of residential stamp duty to be an eye-watering £70.4billion.

Yesterday the National Association of Estate Agents said a record proportion of buyers are being forced to pay above the asking price because there are so few homes with a ‘For Sale’ sign.

‘As supply continues to drop, many more buyers are willing to pay more than the asking price to secure their dream property,’ it said. At the peak of the housing market in 2008, there was an average of 100 properties for sale in each estate agency branch. It is now less than half that.

A Treasury spokesman said stamp duty was ‘an important source of Government revenue, raising several billion pounds each year to help pay for the essential services the government provides and supports’.

She added that there were no plans to reform the system.

A separate report, from the banking giant Halifax, predicts that Britain will become ‘a nation of renters’ within a generation as young people are frozen out of the property market by soaring house prices.

The report said people ‘are now beginning to accept a lifetime of renting’. When asked about the future of homeownership in Britain, the Halifax poll found that nearly half – 48 per cent – believe Britain will become a nation of renters within a generation.

Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘We may be heading towards the point where the aspiration to own a nice home will be replaced by the aspiration simply to live in one. It seems that people are now beginning to accept a lifetime of renting.’

The Halifax report – based on a poll of more than 8,000 people – reveals that more than 60 per cent of first-time buyers between the age of 20 and 45 who bought in the past four years needed help from their parents.
