If there is one thing that Daniel Craig is more famous for than those skimpy blue swimming trunks, it is his sharp suits.

So as we gear up for the hotly anticipated release of the new 007 film Sky Fall, it comes as no surprise that sales of suits are on the up as men seemingly rush to emulate their dapper action hero.

Bond fans who can't splash out on a Tom Ford suit like the spy himself can settle for a very cut-price version by George at Asda, where it is reported that sales of men’s

launch date looms - something the store is attributing to the James Bond effect.
