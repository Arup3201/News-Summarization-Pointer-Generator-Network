The chances of Kenni Wenna's old demo being discovered were like finding a needle in a haystack.

The builder thought he had hit the big time when he was spotted busking in the mid-1990s  and offered a life changing contract by Cargill Bruce, the boss of independent Manchester record label Global I.

But the 57 year old's singing career stalled when the now-defunct label hit financial problems. His recording deal fell through and the father-of-two was forced back to his day job as a builder.

Amazingly, 15 years later Cargill found Kenni’s demo while he was rummaging in his 
garage and knew the songs could still be a hit.

Busker Kenni Wenna, had lost all hope of hitting the big time, but 15 years later he has been given a record deal after an old demo was found in a garage

Kenni was facing eviction from his flat after struggling to find work for two years when just a week later he received a record deal offer worth £250,000.

Stunned reggae star Kenni, from Walthamstow, London, called Cargill and accepted his offer to record an album, which is due to hit the shelves in time for Christmas.

Kenni said: 'It all happened really quickly when I was spotted back in 1997.

'I went to meet the guy from the label and recorded a demo.

'But then I heard nothing from them and I went back to working as a welder and builder.

'I had been unemployed for about two years and was really struggling to find any work.

Kenni Wenna's demo languished in a garage for 15 years until record label boss, Cargill Bruce found it and offered him a record deal worth £250,000

The demo was buried amongst files and hidden by bikes and old benches since the mid 1990's

'I was facing eviction and had bailiffs on my case as I was struggling to pay my bills.

'I was shocked when I received a letter from them asking me to call and discuss working with them again.

'It is a brilliant opportunity for me - especially at my age.

'You could say the letter from the record company was very good timing.

Kenni was spotted by a Manchester based record label, but it hit hard times and the father-of-two went back to his day job as a builder

'My children think it is exciting that their dad is a popstar.

'They are over-the-moon for me. It is good for them too.'

Kenni’s interest in music began in church with his mother who was a talented church organist and choir singer.

His influences include Bob Marley, James Brown, Fela Kuti, Lonnie Johnson, Curtis May, Ray Davis, U2 and Bob Dylan.

Kenni’s reggae inspired album Real Lite will be released in time for Christmas under the new label The Wenna Project.

The label is run by Cargill Bruce, who believes his songs will still be a hit today.

Cargill Bruce, 45, said: 'A friend of mine spotted Kenni busking in Camden and I loved what he did.

He writes great songs and is a really nice guy.

'We ran out of funds so all the demos were in the garage for 15 years before we got ourselves together to start up again.

'I was really pleased when Kenni responded to our letter.

'We got a new producer in to update Kenni’s album, but his songs are timeless and still sound as good 15 years on.

'We were advised by people that Kenni was too old at 57, but we believe everyone deserves a chance in the music industry.'

Kenni was sent a letter offering him a record deal worth £250,000 and his reggae inspired album 'Real Lite' will be released in time for Christmas

Kenni said: “I have always been a songwriter and when I could not find someone to sing my songs for me I started doing the vocals myself.

'My Inspiration comes from a place that is faithful to my spirit, from the many artists of past and present, my mother and life experience.

'I write with a message of hope and love, using conscious lyrics through a mix of styles and genres in an upbeat rhythmical way.'
