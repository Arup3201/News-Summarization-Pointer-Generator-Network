Demands were growing last night for a judge-led inquiry into Britain’s complicity in torture after a day of drama at Westminster.

Three days after a US Senate report revealed details of the CIA’s barbaric interrogation techniques, MPs demanded answers to disturbing questions about the UK’s role.

Senior figures from all major parties said the full truth must be known about the role played by British agents – and what the Blair Government knew about it.

In a significant development, Nick Clegg broke ranks to say a full judicial inquiry may be needed.

It was also revealed that Home Secretary Theresa May secretly met with the Senate intelligence committee amid claims the Government frantically ‘lobbied’ to keep Britain out of the damning report.

On a day of fast-moving developments, it emerged that:

Pressure has been mounting since Tuesday for Britain to hold its own inquiry to uncover the unvarnished truth about its role in the so-called ‘war on terror’.

The Senate committee revealed the most gruesome details about the CIA’s torture programme, but all references to the role played by America’s allies – including Britain – were redacted, despite them being passed information gleaned from the inhumane treatment.

The explosive 499-page report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia – the British base from which rendition flights are known to have taken place. In advance of its publication, there were 22 meetings between the Senate committee and the UK’s ambassador to Washington. It has now emerged Mrs May, who has oversight of MI5, also met with the committee.

Crucially, Lord West – who was the security minister in the last Labour Government – also held talks. The spotlight is particularly intense on Labour, which was in power during the duration of the CIA ‘enhanced interrogation’ programme between 2001 and 2007.

There are huge questions over not only what Mr Blair personally knew, but also the roles played by ex-Foreign Secretaries Jack Straw and David Miliband.

Yesterday, Ed Miliband – who still has a strained relationship with his elder brother after beating him to the Labour leadership – said David would ‘never’ have knowingly allowed British agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the CIA.

Asked whether his brother had questions to answer, Mr Miliband said: ‘He answered questions about this in the House of Commons while he was in government.

‘He is never somebody who would ever countenance the British state getting engaged in this kind of activity.’ Significantly, however, he described the Senate report as ‘deeply troubling’ – and declined to defend Mr Blair.

Mr Miliband stopped short of backing calls for a judge-led inquiry – which could be hugely embarrassing for his brother – but last night MPs on all sides said only a full investigation could get to the truth.

David Cameron originally supported a judge-led inquiry and appointed Sir Peter Gibson to take charge. However, amid huge controversy, the inquiry was scrapped last year before completion. Instead, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee has been tasked with the investigation – sparking fears of a whitewash.

Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘It’s essential that we have a full judge-led inquiry independent of political input. There are serious questions to be answered by Tony Blair and David Miliband and others.’

SNP MP Angus MacNeil said the CIA torture methods were ‘stomach-churning’, adding: ‘There are huge question marks for Tony Blair and his ministers.’ He said he wouldn’t trust the Intelligence and Security Committee ‘to run a bath, much less an inquiry’.

Ex-Tory shadow home secretary David Davis – who has accused Britain of time and again ‘turning a blind eye’ to US torture – said a judge-led inquiry should be reinstated, as Mr Cameron originally promised. The demand is backed by a string of human rights groups, including Reprieve, Liberty and Redress.

Mr Clegg said during his weekly LBC radio phone-in: ‘Once the police investigations are done, once the report from the Intelligence and Security Committee is done, we should keep an open mind, if we need to, about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions.’

Mr Brennan said the CIA was ‘not prepared’ to run the controversial programme and it ‘failed to live up to the standards we set ourselves’.

But in a rare press conference, he refused to call the treatment of terror suspects torture and at no point said he would consider stepping down.

Mr Brennan said he wanted to remind the world that after the 9/11 attacks, America’s ‘hearts were ripped open’ and that the US ‘ached, it cried in pain’.

He said: ‘There were no easy answers and whatever your views are... this agency did a lot of things right.’
