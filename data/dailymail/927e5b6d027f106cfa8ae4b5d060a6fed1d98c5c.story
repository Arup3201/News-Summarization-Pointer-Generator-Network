Radamel Falcao has been reduced to tears by his Manchester United nightmare, according to the Colombia star’s former agent.

Silvano Espindola revealed that Falcao phoned him from Old Trafford last week before he was made to play for the Under 21s against Tottenham and admitted he felt ‘weird’ about the situation.

The 29-year-old striker also expressed fears that he risked a recurrence of his serious knee injury by playing against lower-grade opposition.

Falcao is earning £280,000-a-week during his loan to United from Monaco, but it looks increasingly unlikely that Louis van Gaal will sanction a £43million deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season.

The former Porto and Atletico Madrid man has only scored four goals for United and has not started a game for three weeks.

Espindola, Falcao’s close friend and former representative, told AS Colombia: ‘We speak a lot. I am not going to tell you that he feels happy because he isn’t. We speak many times, and we cry together.

‘It is not an easy situation because every player wants to play and every goalscorer wants to score goals, it’s what’s normal.

‘While on his way to the ground to play that match with the youth team he called me. We talked for about 20 minutes while he arrived at the stadium and he told me “something like this had never happened to me – I don’t know how to handle the situation, I feel weird!”

‘He was a little fearful because he is afraid of those matches with the youth teams and of the second and third divisions. In those categories they are used to whacking and going in hard. That was how they injured him in France, with a team from the fourth division.’
