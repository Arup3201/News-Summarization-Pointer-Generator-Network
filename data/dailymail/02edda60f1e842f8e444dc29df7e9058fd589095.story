Students preparing for college campus tours can now make the task easier by hopping on a private jet and visiting schools  - but it will cost $43,500.

The price is nearly the same as the $43,938 undergraduate tuition  at Harvard (that's not including room and board).

The ten-hour flight cards offered by Magellan Jets, a company that provides private travel services, also include perks like car services to transport clients to and from each campus.

In its second year of running the offer, the company said last year 18 people purchased the cards, and each made around three or four college visits in one day.

This year, they are expecting 50 buyers of the package, which is offered from March 25 - June 30, a Magellan spokeswoman told CNBC. 

'There is a little bit of a misconception with private jets that it's all glitz and glamour, but the real reason people use them is productivity and efficiency,' Greg Belezerian, vice president at Magellan told MarketWatch. 

'This is a tool that our clients use in order to be more efficient. I know that might sound weird, but that's really why they're using it.'

While data from last year revealed that over the past three decades the average tuition at a public four-year college had more than tripled,  most families are likely looking at financial aid options before considering splurging on a chartered jet to visit campuses. 

But for those who can afford to dish out the money, Magellan said its college tour service was created as a way to help alleviate the stress that often comes with campus visits, according to CNN Money. 

Belezerian said the idea came from clients who were already using their services for college tours so they just met the demand.

Last year, he told Business Insider that through the service, a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities in one weekend. 

He said they were able to take one student to visit Northwestern, Duke, and Syracuse in one day. 

This year they have already taken a few clients on tours.

The company organizes a flight schedule based on the schools a client wants to visit, then sets up the car services, while some times even coordinating private tours of college towns with local chauffeurs.

If a family using the service cannot fit in all of the schools they wanted to visit using the ten-hour card, they have to purchase additional  cards.

Following each visit, their client is given a notepad from each college they toured so they can write their feedback.

Magellan puts together all of the notes and sums up their client's reaction from each school.

And once the college hopeful chooses a school, they receive a gift basket from the company filled with branded items from the institution.

Mimi Doe, co-founder of Application Boot Camp, which offers a $16,000 four-day course for students to complete their college applications, said she is surprised there are not more concierge-style college visiting services.

She told MarketWatch: 'It's clunky to visit schools. There should be a hotel/private plane/car service that's all connected.'
