The husband of an elderly stroke patient says he plans to take legal action as far as the European Court of Human Rights so that he can care for his wife, instead of her being sent to a care home.

Edith McDermott, 77, has been treated at the Royal Blackburn Hospital since suffering a stroke last September, when she lost the use of her left arm and leg.

Her husband Richard, to whom she has been married for 58 years, has been determined to nurse his wife at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Richard McDermott, 82, says he will take legal action to stop his 77-year-old wife Edith being moved to a care home, instead of being looked after by him at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire

Until last week, he believed she would be returning home and he even went on a course to ensure he had the correct qualifications to care for his wife.

But the 82-year-old has been told by medical staff that Mrs McDermott - who can no longer sit up on her own and has to be fed through a tube - needs 24-hour care by qualified staff at a care home.

Now Mr McDermott says he plans to fight the case 'tooth and nail' so he can care for his wife - even if it ends up at the highest European court.

The former airman and BAE engineer said: 'I will fight to the end. If I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights, I will do it.

'I will fight tooth and nail. I will go to Strasbourg, I’m not worried.'

Mrs McDermott, who has three sons with her husband, was in good health until she fell ill last year.

She started suffering pins and needles in her arm while shopping at Asda and was taken to hospital for a scan. She later suffered a stroke.

Mr McDermott said: 'She has not moved out of that ward since she went in there. If anything, she is deteriorating.

'It’s pathetic to stand by the bed and look at her. I have had to take her rings off in case they are stolen and she has no dentures in.

'She looks a first class mess and I’m not too big to say so. She has been lying in a bed staring at a ceiling for ten months.'

Mr McDermott said he has held several meetings with nurses, consultants and social services at the hospital about his wife's future care.

He said: 'The tone of the meetings seemed to change from her going home to her going in a nursing home.

'I made it clear every time they brought it up that it’s my wife’s wish to go home. This went on until six weeks ago.

'I went for another meeting and the district nurse came down. She arranged to see me at the house and said we will have her home for the Wednesday.

'I was over the moon. Things were going right at last. Then I get a call the day before asking if I would go for a meeting at the hospital.

'I will fight to the end. If I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights, I will do it'

'The family doctor was there, insisting she goes to a nursing home. Now they say they want fully qualified nurses and she needs 24 hour care. They are trying to say she does not have the mental capacity to make that decision herself.'

Mr McDermott said medical equipment, such as a specialist bed, had been delivered to his home and set up in the corner alongside a television, ready for his wife’s arrival.

He also said he had been on a training course to use the PEG Feeding System his wife uses, and said she is no longer ‘being treated for anything to do with the stroke’ in hospital.

He added: 'The physios say she is unsafe in a wheelchair. I don’t believe them. I want a second opinion. The ward nurse said she will be in that condition until the day she passes.'

Mr McDermott met his wife when he was in a Manchester bar in the 1950s.

He said: 'This young whippersnapper came up to me and said, ‘do you not speak to anybody?' We got talking, and now we’ve been married for 58 years. We are two complete opposites, and that’s a good thing.'

Chris Pearson, chief nurse at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are unable to comment on Mr and Mrs McDermott’s current situation.

'Whilst we deeply sympathise with Mr McDermott, we are keeping him informed every step of the way.'

A spokeswoman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said social services had not been involved in the dispute, and declined to comment.
