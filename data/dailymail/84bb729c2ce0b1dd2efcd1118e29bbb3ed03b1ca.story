Police said that the student had brought a .40-caliber handgun with him to school. The weapon is believed to have been legally registered to a relative. 

According to ABC7, a suicide note was found with the boy. No other students were in the bathroom when the child fired the gun, police said. 

The boy's parents have been informed of his death.

Teachers alerted the police and the school building was put on lock-down as terrified parents rushed to collect their children.

Students walked away from the school, many with arms wrapped around their parents and looking visibly upset.
