A 20-year-old man convicted of shooting a state trooper dead during a routine traffic stop has been declared brain dead after attempting to kill himself, just a week after being sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Eric Knysz  was found in his prison cell, hanging by a bed sheet and is now on a ventilator at a Jackson hospital in Michigan, while doctors conduct tests to see if his organs can be donated.

He was given a whole life tariff last week after being found guilty of murdering 43-year-old Paul Butterfield II when the police officer pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, Michigan last September.

Michigan State Police officials, who are investigating Knysz's suicide attempt, have referred questions about Knysz to the corrections department.

Cut short: State Trooper Butterfield was newly engaged to Jennifer Sielski when he was shot dead

Knysz was under suicide watch while he was being held at the Mason County Jail, sources said, but that he never displayed any suicidal behavior.

Officer Butterfield was shot in the head during a routine traffic stop on September 9, 2013 and died in surgery later the same day.

Knysz was arrested along with his wife Sarah in Manistee County shortly after the shooting.

According to testimony at his trial, his motive was fear of going to prison because he was driving on a suspended license and had guns concealed in the pickup truck he was driving.

The result of his action was a life sentence to prison, and ultimately his suicide attempt.

As well as first degree murder, Knysz was also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm and being an habitual offender.

Speaking at Knysz’s sentencing last week, Butterfield’s fiancee Jennifer Sielski said: 'I felt like 
the luckiest woman in the world just to be a part of Paul’s life... He was
 my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.'

Mr Butterfield's father also spoke at the sentencing, addressing Knysz directly.

'At the age of 19 years old you have 
effectively ended the life of freedom for yourself... At 19, Paul was a 
high school graduate, a state class A cross-country champion and 
enrolled at the University of Tennessee for track and country. He ran 
marathons world-wide and participated in several triathalons… what have 
you accomplished by the age of 19?' he said.

'I
 do not know if you’re planning on giving a statement to the court but 
if you say how sorry you are for what happened it’ll be for one reason 
and one reason only and as that is you got caught,' Mr Butterfield added.

During sentencing Knysz did apologise to the Butterfield family 'for everything I’ve done and the pain I’ve put them through'.

'I’m sorry, I never meant to take the life of your son. I never meant for any of this to happen,' he added.

In his closing arguments during the trial, defense 
attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz 
in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him.

Glancy
 said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a
 sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact.

Sarah Knysz,
 who was in the car at the time of the shooting, had told the court it 
was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she 
protected her husband after the shooting.

'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said.

'He
 had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he 
going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to 
turn him in? I just wanted to keep me and my baby safe. I was just 
thinking about my baby.'

She added: 'I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I didn’t have control over it happening.'
