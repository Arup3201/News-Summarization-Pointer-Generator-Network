Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match after propelling New Zealand to a massive first-innings lead in their quarter-final against West Indies.

The 28-year-old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 off 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes, of which one found the roof of Wellington's Westpac Stadium in the final over.

After posting the highest individual score in a World Cup match, Guptill left his team in an extremely strong position to win as they reached 393 for six.

Guptill was undoubtedly the star of the opening innings - but he was given an extra life in the very first over.

Just three balls in, Marlon Samuels dropped the Aucklander and Guptill thanked him by finding the first of his many boundaries before Brendon McCullum fell for 12 runs, West Indies captain Jason Holden rising to the occasion to take a stunning catch at deep cover.

Guptill then survived two appeals for lbw, chipping away at the attack in between times, and he remained in place after West Indies claimed their second wicket in the 16th over.

Kane Williamson had put on 33 before falling to Andre Russell, whose wide delivery ended up with Chris Gayle at short cover.

Meanwhile Guptill was moving towards his half-century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put New Zealand on 105 for two.

Nothing could stop the Derbyshire batsman and after making his seventh ODI hundred he took off his helmet and saluted the roaring capacity crowd.

His ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted Darren Sammy to wide long-on.

Guptill was perhaps guilty of ball-watching when Ross Taylor was run out for 42 but, despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics, he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in ODIs with a single off Sulieman Benn.

Corey Anderson was then caught by an off-pace delivery from Russell, shuffling across to pull the ball across to Gayle at midwicket for 15.

Guptill's double-ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it, achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off Russell before partner Grant Elliott was dismissed on review.

The South Africa-born all-rounder had bolstered Guptill's charge with 27 runs off 11 balls, including two fours and two sixes, but he was given out despite appealing Taylor's claim for lbw.

Guptill ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199 and the brink of greatness.

Then, from the first ball of the 48th over, he drilled Russell's delivery to long-off for a four that made World Cup history.

The Black Caps would lose Luke Ronchi (nine) before the break, courtesy of Taylor's yorker that ended up with Benn, but Guptill was uncowed and ploughed on to register a mammoth score of 237.

Of the two sixes he hit in the final over, one travelled over 110 metres to end up on the roof of the stadium, and he left the field to a standing ovation.
