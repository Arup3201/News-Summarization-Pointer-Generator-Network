If you already have your concerns about the number of young children using mobile phones, the situation is set to get even worse.

By 2020, Ericsson predicts that as many as 90 per cent of the world’s population over six years old will own a handset.

And within the next six years, the total number of people globally with smartphones could exceed 6.1 billion - up from this year’s 2.7 billion.

By 2020, Ericsson predicts that as many as 90 per cent of the world’s population over six years old will own a mobile phone. Sales in Europe will reach  95% by 2020, while in the Middle East, numbers will peak at 55%

The predictions come from Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report, which tracks trends around mobiles, data and networks worldwide.

The report claims that in the near future, there will be significant regional differences when it comes to people buying smartphones.

For example, sales in Europe will reach around 95 per cent by 2020, while in the Middle East they will peak at 55 per cent.

Gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations.

The majority of parents in a recent poll by BullGuard admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly, and 77 per cent blamed the web.

They attributed this accelerated maturity, in particular, to peer pressure, the vast amount of information they see online, and social networks. 

And many of these devices will predominantly be used to watch videos.

In fact, Ericsson predicts that video traffic will increase tenfold by 2020, and make up 55 per cent of all mobile data traffic.

Devices used to watch videos will also evolve, explained the report.

Many  will have larger screens, higher picture quality and, with the advent of 5G, will have improved streaming quality inside, and outside the home.

Rima Qureshi, Senior Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of M&A, Ericsson, said: "The falling cost of handsets, coupled with improved usability and increasing network coverage, are factors that are making mobile technology a global phenomenon that will soon be available to the vast majority of the world's population, regardless of age or location.’

‘The Ericsson Mobility Report shows that in 2020 the world will be connected like never before,’ Mr Qureshi added.

Over the past three months, 70 per cent of all phones sold were smartphones, compared with 55 per cent in the same quarter for 2013.

The report is the seventh edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report.

A recent survey from BullGuard found that gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations.

The majority of parents who took part in the admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly, and 77 per cent blamed the web.

They attributed this accelerated maturity, in particular, to peer pressure, the vast amount of information they see online, and social networks. 

In response to the Ericsson report, Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, said: 'Entry-level smartphones are now affordable enough to warrant parents giving children their own handsets. 

'While that means parents’ mobiles are less regularly commandeered for Minecraft or Angry Birds, phones are easily lost or broken, and minors are vulnerable to smartphone thefts. 

'We’re seeing increasing numbers of parents take out cover for their children’s smartphones.'
