If you want to avoid spoilers for your favourite TV show or a movie you're planning to watch, this new website from Netflix is definitely not for you.

Called ‘Living with spoilers’ it lets users watch short video clips that reveal major plot points in popular TV shows and movies - both old and new. 

And the site also lets people vote on which spoilers they think should be in the public domain.

California-based Netflix has revealed a website that shows people spoilers. Called 'Living with spoilers' users can click through various scenes (shown). Each shows a video clip from a show that reveals a major plot point

The website is intended to be fun, rather than a serious attempt to ruin people’s enjoyment of a story.

A section called ‘Spoil yourself’ lets users play a Russian roulette-style game where they click through a series of spoilers.

Within the next decade, the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts, no more channels, and no more menus.

That’s according to Netflix’s chief product officer Neil Hunt.

He predicts that by ‘2025 or sooner’ services such as his own, will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in.

And everyone will get their own, dedicated channel. 

Each click reveals a new major plot point from a TV show or movie hosted on Netflix.

The spoilers in this section are voted for by members of the public.

They can vote for specific moments from shows and movies and decide if a specific spoiler should be hosted in the roulette-style game.

For example, quotes from The Hunger Games can be approved or rejected for inclusion in the public domain of spoilers.

While most of the spoilers involve classic films, some more recent shows such as Breaking Bad are also included - so viewers should steer clear if they're wary of what they might see.

Elsewhere on the site, users can take part in a quiz to find out what type of ‘spoiler’ they are.

The questions determine whether they enjoying ruining shows for others, or if they do it accidentally.

The release of the site followed a transatlantic online study into spoilers commissioned by Netflix.

It showed that less than four per cent of people in the UK think it’s okay to spoil programmes for others, while 76 per cent of Americans say spoilers are a fact of life.

By comparison only 24 per cent of Brits thought we should have to put up with spoulers.

And 58 per cent of Brits felt guilty if they spoiled a major plot twist to someone else, compared to just 37 per cent of Americans.

Author and cultural anthropologist Dr Grant McCracken helped Netflix to make the findings; he went into the living rooms of TV viewers in the UK and US to get an in-depth understanding of their viewing behaviour.

‘The UK has a rich history of making great TV. And over the past few years, writers and showrunners from other countries have started creating complex and morally challenging TV, too,’ said Dr McCracken.

‘This new and improved TV is forcing a change in the way, the urgency, with which we talk about TV.

‘TV has, in effect, become more provocative of spoilers and more worthy of them.

‘While Brits are still more conservative in their TV conversation, we are seeing a less censored TV fan emerging here in the UK.’

The survery in the UK was carried out by YouGov in July 2014 and involved 2,421 men and women over 18 years of age, while in the US Harris Poll spoke to 2,023 adults in August.
