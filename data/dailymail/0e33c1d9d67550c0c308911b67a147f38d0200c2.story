A home-made drone capable of launching airborne cyber attacks and hijacking mobile phone calls has been developed by two computer security experts.

The Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform - or Wasp - was constructed from a former U.S. Army target drone.

Richard Perkins and Mike Tassey customised the aircraft so it can find and track internet hotspots and mobile phones.

Airborne cyber master: The Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform - or Wasp - was constructed from a former U.S. Army target drone. Inventor Richard Perkins introduces the craft at the DefCon hacking conference in Las Vegas at the weekend

Mr Perkins and co-designer Mike Tassey customised the aircraft so it can find and track internet hotspots and mobile phones

It can identify unsecured online gateways and then exploit these to launch cyber attacks on computer systems.

The
craft can also capture GMS mobile PIN numbers that can then be used to 
pay for outgoing calls, allow hackers to eavesdrop on conversations and 
even impersonate mobile phone towers.

Mr
Perkins said: 'It will fly a plotted course and return to base. We 
loaded it up with the ability to attack wi-fi, Bluetooth, and GSM 
cellular networks.'

The two men exhibited the bright yellow Wasp, which weighs just 14lbs, at the DefCon hacking conference in Las Vegas at the weekend.

They
built it for a total of just $6,200 and claim their inspiration was to 
force the computer industry into realising that anybody has access to 
the materials to make such a hi-tech device.

The implications and potential uses for Wasp are quite extraordinary.

It could find mobile phones in disaster areas and lead rescuers to survivors, or it could fly over a disaster zone to act as a mobile phone tower enabling calls.

However, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, Wasp could quite easily infiltrate a company's computer networks via unsecured wi-fi networks.

And that's just for starters.

Mr Perkins said: 'I can take the various pieces of your digital life - Bluetooth headset, mobile phone, wi-fi - and find the least secure place you exist and attack you there.'

Even more worryingly, Wasp could carry a small payload, opening up the potential for smugglers to use it or to serve as a targeted biological or nuclear weapon in a terror attack.

Unsurprisingly, authorities in the U.S. will not allow the drone to fly over populated areas.
