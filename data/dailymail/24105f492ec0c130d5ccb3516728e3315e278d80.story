It started off as the hottest barristers in Britain, then came the babes of the bar - now the hottest men in artwork have been revealed.

The best-looking male muses in paintings at the National Portrait Gallery have been uncovered by the infamous Your Barrister Boyfriend blog.

He tops the list of the 'hottest men in National Portrait Gallery', according to the Your Barrister Blog Tumblr blog.
