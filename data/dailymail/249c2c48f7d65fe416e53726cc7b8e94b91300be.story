'All an act': Chef Nigella Lawson, pictured on The Taste, has described her on-screen persona as a 'circus act'

She might present a sunny and seductive image as she tells you about her flourless chocolate brownies, but Nigella Lawson warns she's not all sweet.

In a candid interview, the television chef, 53, describes herself as 'dark' and tells of her childhood melancholia.

She said: 'Maybe I didn't feel very lovable for a child. When I was small I just couldn't get out of my little dark place.

'My mother thought I was autistic, because I would be sitting on a swing talking to myself.'

Her suggestive television performances with recipes such as self-saucing chocolate puddings have won her many male fans.

Her late husband, the journalist John Diamond, had teased her about her flamboyant inner self she said, but she used it for her programmes.

Miss Lawson said: ‘It’s part of me - the circus act. But I had to bring it out. John used to say I had a hidden gay man inside of me.’

The chef, 53, was speaking in the wake of her new found fame in America, where she has acted as a judge on ABC cooking show The Taste. A figure-hugging red dress she wore on screen attracted particular attention.

And she said the dress she wears on the front cover of her latest book, Nigellissima, about Italian cooking, was probably inspired by one worn by actress Catherine Deneuve in classic film Belle du Jour, which tells of an apparently perfect wife with hidden passions.

In an interview published in Newsweek magazine, she told of darker times before she entered the limelight.

Her father was Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, and her mother was Vanessa Salmon, from the family which created the Lyons Corner House chain of restaurants.

Miss Lawson, wife of multi-millionaire advertising mogul-cum-art collector Charles Saatchi, 69, said: ‘As I get older I am much less prone to bouts of melancholia.’

No tears: Nigella (pictured yesterday) said: 'People think that if you cook you're all sweetness and light. And I am a dark person'

She went on: ‘I used to not be able to get up in the morning.’ 

Miss Lawson said that difficulty in getting up was a known sign of depression, adding ‘Well - I’ve got better at that.’ 

But, in contrast to her sunny and seductive image, she said: ‘I am dark. People think that if you cook you’re all sweetness and light. And I am a dark person.

‘Which doesn’t mean I don’t take an inordinate amount of pleasure in life.

‘There’s a fantastically bad biopic of Mussolini. And he says to Mrs. Mussolini, “Why do you always look on the dark side?” And she says, “There is no other side.” It’s almost worth watching that film for that reason.’

Staying with the emotions, and 
speaking of her aversion to crying, Miss Lawson said: ‘I don’t like 
women crying in offices, but then I’m not crazy about men crying in 
offices either.

‘I did send my boss home once for crying in the office.

‘Even if I’m exhausted to the point of weeping I wouldn’t. I’m proud and I never cry.’ 

Moving on to her performance in her 
cookery shows - often lampooned for being sexually suggestive - Miss 
Lawson said it came from a part of her personality long kept hidden.

Miss Lawson says in reality she has a 'dark' personality and has suffered from bouts of melancholy in the past

Miss
Lawson said: ‘I used to think there was a discrepancy, between the 
circus and the act-seriousness: now I think everything’s dark and light 
at the same time. It’s life totally.’

The celebrity chef says she has become less prone to melancholia as she has got older

She also warmly discussed her relationship with the film crew for her shows - who have remained the same since her very first series, produced when late husband John was dying.

‘They’re my family,’ she said. ‘My children remember them from when they were little.

‘If I was to lose them it would be a much greater loss: I wouldn’t mind if we never put the programs out.’

She also simply enjoys the hubbub of having to produce the programmes she said, with the profit she makes - after amassing up to £20m from her cookery career so far - not much of a spur to work.

‘I don’t like being left all alone to myself,’ Miss Lawson said. ‘I don’t like the emptiness and the void - the sense when the light goes off when the fridge door closes.’

Miss Lawson also recalled former-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wincing when her father Nigel Lawson drove her through London, speeding through red lights.

The cookery writer has spoken in the past of how she never thought she could please her mother, who would shout and beat her.

Miss Lawson has two children by her first marriage, Cosima, 18, and Bruno, 16. First husband John Diamond died aged 41 of throat cancer in 2001.
