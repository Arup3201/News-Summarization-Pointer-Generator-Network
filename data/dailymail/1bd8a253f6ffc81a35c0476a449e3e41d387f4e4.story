A study out this summer from Ohio State University says smokers cost their employers around $6,000 per year more than non-smokers.

Researchers led by Micah Berman, who will become an assistant professor at the university’s College of Public Health this month, used the findings of previous studies to take a comprehensive look at the financial burden smokers put on their employers.

Coming as no surprise, smoke breaks cost employers the lion’s share of the six grand, followed by higher healthcare costs, absenteeism, and lower productivity.

‘This research should help businesses make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,’ Berman said. ‘We constructed our calculations such that individual employers can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their own costs.’

The study came up with some precise numbers for how much absenteeism, lost productivity, smoke breaks and health care cost employers each year.

On average, smoke breaks cost employers $3,077 per year, while the second highest expenditure, health care, costs employers an average of $2,056 per year.

And while absenteeism caused by ill health made up around $500 of the costs, ‘presenteeism’—or reduced productivity—accounted for $462 of the researchers’ calculations.

Breakdown: The study, led by researcher Micah Berman, came to some very specific dollar amounts about how smokers cost their employers money

But not them all: By dying, some retired smokers could could save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer-lived non-smokers

All told, the annual costs could range from $2,885 to $10,125 per smoker, according to the study.

Some smokers, however, can actually save their employers money the study also found.

Though they have to be dead.

When a retiree who receives a set amount of pension each year from his or her former employer dies, that employer saves around $296. This happens because of the difference in lifespan between smokers and non-smokers because the shorter-lived smokers actually help offset pensions of the longer-lived non-smokers.

Meanwhile, Berman urged employers not to start fuming right away.

‘Employers should be understanding about how difficult it is to quit smoking and how much support is needed,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely not just a cost issue, but employers should be informed about what the costs are when they are considering these policies.’
