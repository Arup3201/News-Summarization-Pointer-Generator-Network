Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money have been wasted by giving loans to bogus students from the EU, MPs warn today.

Some £3.84million was handed out over the last four years to EU students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding.

Only those who have lived in the UK for three years can receive loans to cover living costs. If they have not been resident in the UK for the previous years but are EU citizens, they are only eligible for loans to cover their tuition fees.

Loans: £3.84million was handed out over the last four years to EU students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding, a cross-party report by MPs has found

And the total amount wasted is likely to be much higher, as the MPs said the Government was ‘unable to quantify’ how much money was given to students who then failed to attend or complete courses.

Some 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not even registered for a qualification, according to the Public Accounts Committee’s report, published today.

The number of privately funded colleges, or ‘alternative providers’, has grown rapidly, with 53,000 students claiming financial support in 2013/2014 compared with 7,000 in 2010/2011.

The total public money paid to these students has increased from £50 million to £675 million in that period. 

Public Accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge criticised the 'lax' approach

The committee said the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills drove this expansion ‘without sufficient regulation’ to protect public money.

Committee chairman Margaret Hodge criticised the department’s ‘lax approach’ and said it was warned about the risks ‘but chose to disregard them’.

She said: 'The Department pressed ahead with the expansion of the alternative provider sector without sufficient regulation in place to protect public money.

'The Department was explicitly warned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFC) and the Universities and College Union about these risks but chose to disregard them both before and after implementation.

'As a result of its lax approach, the Department allowed £3.84 million of public money to be given to ineligible EU students in the form of student loans and grants, where EU students had either chosen not to or had been unable to prove that they met eligibility criteria on residency.

'Furthermore, it has been unable to quantify how much money has been lost when it has funded students who have failed to attend, or failed to complete courses, or were not proficient in the English language, or were not entered for qualifications, or where courses themselves were poorly taught.'

She also accused ministers of failing legitimate students and colleges, and demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted.

In a report published by the committee today, the MPs examined financial support for students at 140 'alternative higher education providers', which are privately funded but take on those who have student loans.

It found that the rapid expansion in numbers was concentrated in five colleges, which accounted for 50 per cent of the expansion.

Around 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not registered for a qualification and drop-out rates were 'very high' in some institutions.

The committee said that while the expansion was aimed at widening access to UK students, 40 per cent of the publicly funded students at the colleges were actually from the EU.

This compared with 6 per cent in the rest of the higher education sector.

Mrs Hodge noted: 'The Department's record in collecting loan repayments from EU students who have returned overseas is already poor.

'There was also evidence from whistleblowers that proficiency in English language was not tested, that some institutions were recruiting students on the streets, and that students claiming funding were not attending colleges.'

She accused ministers of failing to protect the interests of legitimate students and the reputations of those colleges that were performing well.

She demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted and said measures must be put in place to keep track of expenditure in the future.

It comes after the National Audit Office found in December that thousands of students enrolled with new private higher education colleges were not registered to take recognised exams.

It also warned that the dropout rate among students at nine of the alternative higher education providers was in excess of 20 per cent.

That is five times the dropout rate seen in traditional universities, with which the new colleges were designed to compete.

The expansion of such providers followed reforms introduced by the former higher education minister David Willetts.

'Shocked': UCU general secretary Sally Hunt

Yesterday, University and College Union (UCU) general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: 'Members of the Public Accounts Committee were as shocked as we were over the government's refusal to heed our warnings about private providers' access to taxpayers' money.

The government still has serious questions to answer about why it ignored these repeated warnings and why it allowed such rapid expansion to go unchecked.

'Politicians of all stripes need to study today's report about the sector's failings when it comes to dealing with privatisation.'

Professor Aldwyn Cooper, Vice Chancellor of Regent's University London and Chair of the Independent Universities Group, said: 'It is important to remember that there are many alternative providers offering a first rate higher education.

'The members of the Independent Universities Group (IUG) have undergone stringent quality reviews in order to gain their own degree awarding powers and provide excellent student outcomes.

'These institutions offer first rate value for money, employability and student experience.

'They receive no direct funding from government and are careful to ensure that they are fully compliant with the expectations of the Department and the Student Loans Company.

'Poor quality should not be tolerated. It drains the public purse and risks tarnishing the UK higher education brand.'

A BIS spokesperson said: 'Alternative providers play a significant role in widening access to higher education for British and foreign students, as well as boosting our exports.

'Our priority is to protect the interest of students and safeguard taxpayer's money. We have made continuous improvements to the management of alternative providers since 2012. We recently introduced reforms to drive up quality, aimed at the small number of providers who are not currently meeting our high standards.

'These include a fit and proper persons test for directors and a requirement to register students for the course before they can access funding. We are also shortly consulting on how to ensure that all students on funded courses have the right English language skills to achieve their qualifications.'
