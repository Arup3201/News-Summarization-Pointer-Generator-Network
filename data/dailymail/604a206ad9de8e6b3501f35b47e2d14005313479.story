Oiled up and dancing naked on stage in front of hordes of screaming women, it is clear that male stripper troupe Dreamboys have no shortage of female attention.

But with randy women throwing themselves at the boys at every turn, what is it like for the long-suffering girls who actually date these honed, human Ken dolls?

According to one such woman, who lives with Dreamboy fiancé Tom 'Tommy Love', 25, in Essex, it's an exercise in self-esteem.

You can't be an insecure and jealous person, because the job would drive you nuts,' she says.

'It's funny, a lot of the girlfriends or girls the boys start seeing are girls who they meet at the show.

But the minute they're with them they want them to quit the job.

'A lot of the boys have had girlfriends in the past, but it takes a certain girl to understand and look at the bigger picture. I'd say think about it first before you get with a Dreamboy.'

'You have to be down to earth too,' she says. 'The boys aren't interested in anything fake. 

'If you have a chance to speak to one of them, just be yourself and down to earth and they'll like that better than anything.

The attractive blonde, 27, who wishes not to be named for professional reasons, has been with her stripper lover for more than two years and couldn't be happier - even if he spends his weekends gyrating in front of screaming fans and often comes home to saucy messages.

'We met in November 2012 at an exhibition in London where Tommy and the boys were showcasing their tour and I was doing promotional work.

Tommy's fiancée says the perks of the job involve that he's always in incredible shape

'I was working with my sister and we didn't have the time to watch the show - they were dancing every hour on the dot. But on the last day we were walking down one of the stairs and bumped into them.

'Tommy started speaking to me straight away and invited us to watch the very last show.

'I thought it was good even though as it was during the daytime it was pretty PG. Tommy looked the best to me.'

'He invited me out for dinner and I wasn't going to go at first. They're stereotyped as arrogant and full of themselves. You'd expect that.'

Tommy, however, was more nervous than his future fiancée realised, thinking she was way out of his league.

'To be honest, when I first saw her I 
thought she was too good for me. I was with [fellow Dreamboy] Rowan and 
when we were doing the promo stuff. I said "Look how gorgeous she is",' he says.

Luckily, the two did end up going on the date, and Tommy turned out to be 'very different' to how she'd expected.

The PG performance was impressive - but it gets much raunchier for the real show

Since hooking up with a Dreamboy, Tommy's fiancée has taken her girlfriends to the shows.

'I'd be worried if people didn't think my boyfriend was fit,' she says.

'I'm not insecure at all and I'm not a jealous person, but obviously he gets a lot of female attention and people sometimes try to contact him after the shows on Facebook.

'The boys are all so used to it they handle it really well. There's a strict line between entertaining and crossing the line, and the ones with girlfriends are pretty good at realising that.

'Tommy responds to general fan mail - I don't think it's nice for guys to ignore friendly fan mail - but some girls send awful messages that cross the line; private messages trying to take things further.

She says it's clear from Facebook that he is in a relationship, and it's inappropriate when girls try to 'offer photos in exchange for photos back'.

'It's too flirty and it's not nice to see - but I'm not worried,' she says.

Tommy says despite stage personas behind the scenes they're all different in different ways

Apart from other women fancying her man, Tommy being in the Dreamboys does provide its perks.

'It keeps him in shape,' she says.

'Being part of the Dreamboys means he's always working out, and he does get a good salary.'

However, the promotional model says she works for herself and says she doesn't rely on his money.

The couple got engaged a year after meeting in November 2013 when Tommy took his girlfriend to Paris for her birthday weekend.

Breakfast: At 7am I have 3 boiled eggs and a small portion of smoked salmon with a green 
tea.

Mid-morning: After I've trained at 10am I'll make a protein shake and eata
 hand full of mixed nuts.

Lunch: At 1pm I'll have wholemeal rice with vegetables 
and tuna.

Dinner: Around 5ish I will have sweet potatoes with vegetables and chicken, or
 steak.

Supper: Just before bed at 10ish I will have either a shake or two 
spoonfuls of peanut butter.

Snacks: If I have been good all day I may chuck in a cheeky chocolate bar somewhere.

'He proposed to me by the Notre Dame and then took me to dinner at the Eiffel Tower. He's really romantic.

'We haven't set a date. We're having a big engagement party to celebrate first.'

Tommy, meanwhile, reveals there are two kinds of guys in the business - those who pull a lot of girls and the homebodies.

'I know I get a lot of attention but, for me, I see it as a job and good money. It keeps me fit as I've got to maintain my shape,' says Tommy.

'Once I finish a show I come home as soon as possible to our little pet dog.'

'You can think you're something special and pull a lot of girls or you can see it as a income and then go home to your loved ones.

Tommy, originally from Norwich, used 
to work as a builder and joined The Dreamboys after he was 
approached in the gym when he was training.

He went along to rehearsals, immediately got picked up and started a three-month show with the guys in Germany.

He
 has been with The Dreamboys for three years and keeps his physique 
with a tough schedule of training five times a week and a strict diet 
six days a week.

Dave says keeping in shape is really important

What is it like to be single and part of the Dreamboys?

It's
 great, we have loads of fun on stage and 
it's really convenient for my lifestyle. We also get paid well to work, 
if you can call it that.

I'm doing something I enjoy and getting female 
attention for a couple of hours a week isn't bad either!

Being
 a single Dreamboy is also great. During the week I don't have time for girls as I
 am so busy with my businesses (The Body MASS, a non-profit organisation specialising in University fitness, and the Mr University competition for the most in-shape students in the UK). They can often involve a lot of 
travelling and also training.

At the weekend, it's great to get some 
female attention - it keeps me sane.

Are you looking for love?

I'm
 not actively looking for a girlfriend at the moment, I just don't have 
time as I'm focusing on my businesses. Saying that if the right girl 
came along I wouldn't say no!  

I'm
 really into fitness and healthy lifestyle so she would have to be too -
 sometimes girls don't understand the diet I have to stick to.

I like 
girls who have a similar mindset, are really driven, and know what they 
want in life. I find girls who have lots to say for themselves really 
attractive too.
