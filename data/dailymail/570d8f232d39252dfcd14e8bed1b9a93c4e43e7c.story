A man who has suffered tens of thousands of silent crying seizures since he was a baby has been cured by pioneering surgery.

Chris Murto, 29, endured years of pain and medications due to a rare benign tumor before the procedure at Barrow Neurological Institute at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.

But since undergoing surgery, which involved a laser killing the tumor and required just one stitch afterwards, he has miraculously not suffered a single seizure.

'This surgery has changed my life,' Murto told ABC News. 'It's amazing to have instantly gone from having 250 seizures a 
month to not having one. I'm finally able to live
an independent life.'

New life: Chris Murto, 29, (with his parents Bill and Maura) underwent an operation 2 months ago that cured seizures he has been suffering with since birth. Before the operation, he was having thousands a year

Long suffering: Murto, pictured as a boy, suffered a drop in his IQ thanks to medications and the seizures. By the time he was 13, he was having 350 seizures a day and taking 25 pills

The seizures started when he was a baby and appeared to be night terrors - jolting him awake and causing him to cry.

When he was five, his mother noticed him grimace before a tear rolled down his cheek, and took him to the doctors where he was diagnosed him with a hypothalamic hamartoma, an abnormal collection of cells near his hypothalamus, which is located at the base of the brain.

'The
cells are like a little pacemaker that fires abnormal signals' his neurosurgeon, Dr Peter Nakaji, explained. 'They are basically like a computer 
that keeps resetting. You can imagine how disruptive that is 
and what their life is like.'

As well as causing discomfort and sparking children to laugh or cry against their wills, the seizures can also damage the brain.

Doctors could do nothing but tell Chris to change his diet and give him medications - but drugs drastically affected his cognitive abilities, causing his IQ to plummet from 120 to 79, he told Fox10.

Pioneering: His neurosurgeon, Dr Peter Nakaji, used a laser to burn and kill a tumor at the base of his brain

Life changer: Dr Nakaji (with Murto) said the abnormal cells caused the brain to reset every few minutes

By the time he was 13, he was having as many as 250 seizures a month and taking 25 pills a day. Each seizure lasted around 20 seconds.

'He had tremors in his hand, his eyes rolled up in his head so you could see the whites, he slept a lot and his drool was out of control,' his mother Maura told ABC News. 'He was losing ground mentally and physically.'

Chris added: 'It's impossible to explain the amount of pain I was experiencing.'

He said that the seizures left him feeling displaced and with a pulsing in his ears.

At one point when he was 13, he asked his mother: 'Why won't God just let me die?'

But in August, Dr. Nakaji was finally able to help and treated Murto with a new kind of surgery that uses MRI technology to find and destroy the tumor.

Charting his progress: A chart shows that he had five seizures the morning before surgery - but none since

Relief: His mother Maura said she was 'oh so happy' that her son had not suffered a single seizure since

Dr Nakaji cut a two-millimeter incision in Murto's skull and inserted the laser catheter and lined it up perfectly - careful not to affect any surrounding brain matter.

The laser heated up the tumor and killed it, and the cells were then absorbed into the body. Afterwards, Murto needed just one stitch and stayed in hospital for a night.

Two months on, and Murto has not had a single seizure and can now finally focus on a future.

'It was amazing,' his mother told Fox. 'It went as text book perfect as it could. He had five seizures before the surgery that morning. Has had none since so I was just oh so happy.'

Murto said he now wants to find a job programming computer games.
