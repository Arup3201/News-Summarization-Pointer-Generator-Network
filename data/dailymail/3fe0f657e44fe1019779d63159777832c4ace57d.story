Even Chris Christie's lucky sweater couldn't save the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday as they crashed out  to the Green Bay Packers following a controversial refereeing decision. 

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has referred to the New Jersey Governor as his team's 'mojo' because Dallas has won the last five games Christie has attended wearing the orange sweater for good luck.

But it wasn't to be -  Dez Bryant's apparent catch late in the fourth quarter was reversed by officials.

It was Aaron Rodgers who rallied the Green Bay Packers to a thrilling 26-21 playoff victory, sending them to the NFC title game.

Rodgers powered the homestanding Packers to the triumph with two touchdown passes as they fought back from a 21-13 third-quarter deficit.

He passed for three touchdowns and 317 yards for the game. 

Rep. Paul Ryan didn't miss a chance to rub it in and tweeted a photo to Chris Christie, with the message '@GovChristie, do you need a hug now? #GoPackGo #WinninginWisco'.

Before the game Christie picked the Cowboys to win — 38-28 — and was feeling mighty confident.

'Well, as confident as you can be being on the road and (facing) a team that's undefeated at home,' Christie told The Associated Press. 

'But I feel pretty good. The team's played well, and it's going to be a good day.'

Christie's office has said the governor would again sit in the owner's box with Jones.

Before he went upstairs, Christie posed for pictures on the Dallas sideline near the 35-yard line.

He walked off the field and entered the Packers' tunnel behind Green Bay running back Eddie Lacy before heading to his seat.

Christie wasn't the only potential 2016 presidential candidate at Lambeau on Sunday.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker sat in the stands, decked out in a green Packers jacket and wool knit cap.

'The guy sitting over there showed me his tweet,' Walker told the AP at halftime. 

'He took a picture. ... He said, 'Hey, New Jersey, our governor actually sits with us.' 

So that's kind of fun. Christie's a good friend, and we chat a lot.'

Christie and Walker were trading friendly barbs on social media the past week. 

The prominent Republican governors exchanged texts Sunday. They were supposed to meet before the game but Walker was delayed after getting stuck in traffic.

Christie has faced ethical questions since his office disclosed that Jones had been paying for Christie's box seats and private jet flights. 

Christie's office has said the governor was paying his own way this time to Green Bay.

The governor's passion for the Cowboys also has drawn from outrage from fans in New Jersey of the Eagles, Giants and Jets fans. 

They're angered he isn't backing one the area's teams. 

The Packers will meet the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks in Seattle next Sunday for the NFC championship. The winner goes to the Super Bowl.

The Seahawks beat the Packers 36-16 to open the regular season in September.
