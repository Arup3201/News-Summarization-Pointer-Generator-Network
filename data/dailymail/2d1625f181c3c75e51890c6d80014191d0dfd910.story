A German artist has created a series of unusual and hilarious sculptures using sunglasses-wearing vegetables.

Peter Pink, who describes himself as a 'nonsense maker' uses spuds and cucumbers to create the weird tableaus in public spaces.

One of them sees potatoes on a beach, enjoying the recent fine weather by sunbathing.

Hot potato: Artist Peter Pink uses vegetables to create surreal art installations, like this hilarious beach scene

No need for a jacket: Cocktail umbrellas and tiny plastic sunglasses are used as props in this scene

The artist says his inspiration comes from the need to clown around or question things

Another sees them protesting about their brethren getting sliced and fried outside a McDonalds restaurant, complete with a cordon to contain their demonstration.

The theme of protest continues with the potatoes squaring off against the cucumbers, who stand impassive in a line against the unruly mob. Another installation sees one of the vegetables crucified on a tiny cross.

His Berlin-based works also see cucumbers parading outside the iconic Reichstag building and even a French fry funeral.

Showdown: A line of impassive cucumbers stand against protesting potatoes

Ominous: The work reflects on the issues of protest and consumerism, apparently

Massed potato: He said: 'One morning I had the idea of protesting potatoes. I already was using the sunglasses. 'So I put the sunglasses on the potatoes'

A woman at Berlin's iconic Alexanderplatz snaps the weird artwork

Green berets: The cucumbers look like an army as they line up in formation

The sinister nature of the military-style parade is offset by the bright pink sunglasses, and the fact they're cucumbers

But the art has a point beyond simple entertainment, according to art website Designboom.

It said: 'The setups communicate Pink's opinions about consumerism and policy, while others document culturally significant historical events.

'In one series, the cucumbers are amassed to resemble an army assembly - another depicts the crucifixion. The physical characteristics of the edibles, such as their texture, contour, and color act as a human personality, allowing them distinctive attributes and an anthropological quality.'

Indeed.

Pot-estors: His first work saw seven potatoes protesting outside a Berlin branch of McDonalds

Fries up: The potatoes are presumably angry about the horrors being done their brethren inside the burger restaurant

Sacrilicious: A spud is crucified, complete with a crown of thorns and day-glo stigmata

The artist placed the Potato Jesus outside Place Lustgarten in Berlin on Easter Sunday

Return from whence you came: A potato family gathers to mourn a loved one after his gruesome fate of being sliced up and plunged into hot oil

Mr Pink, 31, said: 'One morning I had the idea of protesting potatoes. I already was using the sunglasses. So I put the sunglasses on the potatoes.

'My inspiration a lot of the time comes from the need to clown, comment, or question things I don't agree with.

'Things where everyone around me is like "Yeah", and I'm like "Really?"'

'I like asking questions and I see life as something to be curious about, not something I need answers for.'
