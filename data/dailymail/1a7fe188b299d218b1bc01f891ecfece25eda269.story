Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka rued his side's first half performance following their exit in the FA Cup at the hands of Arsenal at the Emirates - but not before he was given Mesut Ozil's shirt.

Karanka was a coach at Real Madrid under Jose Mourinho when Ozil was with the Spanish giants and the pair chatted after the final whistle.  

A brace from Olivier Giroud was enough to see the holders through to the quarter-finals, but despite coming up against Premier League opposition, the Boro boss when asked about whether he was disappointed with his side's showing was frank.

'Yes, especially in the first half,' he told BT Sport. 'It is very difficult to beat Arsenal, the first half was not good.' 

Boro won 2-0 at Manchester City in the previous round, but there were stark contrasts between that performance and this according to Karanka.

'All the 50/50s went for them, against Manchester City we won them and we more organised,' he added. 'We showed too much respect.'

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was delighted to avoid another giant-killing and hailed his side for their professional approach.

'It's difficult for everybody in the Premier League,' he said.

'It requires focus and good pace and I think we controlled the game. We started well and played with pace and that gave them problems.'

He added: 'Our fluency was great, our movement was good, our technical control was very good today. We lost a little fraction of urgency at 2-0 but we remained serious for the whole game.'
