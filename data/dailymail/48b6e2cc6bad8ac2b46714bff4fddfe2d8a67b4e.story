UKIP is bidding to make history on Thursday by winning its first Commons seat in the Newark by-election.

The contest follows the resignation of the town’s former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer over a ‘cash-for-access’ scandal. If Nigel Farage’s candidate, Roger Helmer, overturns the Tories’ 16,000 majority at the last Election, it will cause an even bigger  shock than Ukip’s Euro election triumph.

In the words of Farage, the Ukip fox will finally be let loose in the Westminster hen-house.

The stakes are equally high for David Cameron. If Conservative Robert Jenrick wins, the Prime Minister can claim to have stopped Mr Farage’s ‘People’s Army’ in its tracks.

If he loses, the prospect of continuing Ukip support giving Ed Miliband the key to No 10  at the next Election will be all the more likely.

ROGER HELMER

Tory defector who says nobody was offended by previous MP's notorious 'black b*******' gaffe

Nigel Farage may be Britain’s best-known politically incorrect politician, but not for long if Ukip’s Roger Helmer wins the Newark by-election.

His views on immigration, gays, Catholic priests and same-sex marriage make Farage seem almost progressive.

Nearly as colourful are the brown-checked jacket, cream slacks and  red-brown shoes he is wearing for  our interview at a Starbucks cafe in Newark town square.

Unabashed: Roger Helmer, the candidate in this Thursday's parliamentary by-election in Newark

Mr Helmer, who defected from the Conservatives two years ago and is now a Ukip Euro MP, doesn’t actually scoff when I suggest immigration has had benefits too, but his five-word reply, ‘I like Indian restaurants too’, speaks for itself.

A jaunty 70, his moustache and dandyish wardrobe give him a ‘Terry Thomas’-like air.

In the mouth of the BNP’s Nick Griffin, Mr Helmer’s words would sound vile, but like Mr Farage, he is so chirpy and brazen it is harder to take offence.

He supports the repatriation of immigrants to their native countries.

Pruned image: Farage is seen as un-PC, but he's nothing compared to his candidates

‘If someone says, “I came here, gave it a try, don’t like it, can’t stand the weather, I’d really like to go back to Pakistan but I can’t afford to go.” I’d have no objection to taxpayers’ money being used to assist them – but not forcibly,’ he adds quickly.

Would the idea of a black or Muslim Prime Minister of Britain upset him?

‘I wouldn’t panic,’ he says. ‘We had a woman Prime Minister and I rather liked that!’

You can almost hear the ‘arf arf Rog’ at the golf club bar as he replies.

He insists he is ‘fairly relaxed’ about gays, but maintains homophobia  does not exist and accuses ‘strident’ gay rights groups of using it for political ends.

‘Phobia is well defined in psychiatry – get a definition of it,’ he barks. ‘We [Ukip] don’t deny there’s prejudice against minorities, and we condemn it. However, it isn’t a phobia. When people say “we support traditional marriage”, Stonewall says, “Homophobia, homophobia”. It’s a perfectly respectable position to take, it doesn’t require abuse and isn’t a phobia.’

Helmer says the NHS should be allowed to spend money on helping homosexuals become straight. He says it is no different to NHS sex-change operations and, bizarrely, compares it to homeopathy.

‘One person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say, “OK you can do it.”

‘You have a homosexual who  says, “I’m homosexual, actually  I’d rather be straight, is there a way of fixing it?” We say to the person who wants to change from a man to a woman or vice versa, “Please do that on the NHS.” We say to this guy, “That’s wicked, you’re not allowed to think about it.” ’

‘I don’t know if homeopathy works or not, but I will defend the right of anyone who believes it works to  try it.’ He insists he is ‘taking a libertarian view’.

He opposes same-sex marriage. ‘Marriage is defined by history, culture and reproductive biology and deserves special respect in society. (I am) perfectly relaxed about other relationships but they don’t justify the same respect.’

And he claims the Catholic Church is ‘systematically paedophile’.

‘It’s fact. I’m sure the Pope is a nice man. If a few people in the Met Police are racist, people say it is institutionally racist; if hundreds of Catholic priests are paedophiles and I say they’re paedophile, it’s terrible.’ Ex-Newark Tory MP and former Army officer Mercer caused uproar when he said being called a ‘black b******’ was a normal part  of Army life.

Helmer leaps to his defence. ‘Nobody was offended. Get real. What’s that line from Kipling? “Single men in barracks don’t grow into plaster saints.” ’

Mr Helmer’s critics say he is more sinner than saint. He won’t care if he wins in Newark on Thursday.

ON REPATRIATION OF IMMIGRANTS

‘If someone says ‘‘I came here, gave it a try, don’t like the weather, I’d really like to go back to Pakistan but I can’t afford to go’’, I’d have no objection to taxpayers’ money being used to assist them – but not forcibly’

ON NHS TREATMENT TO 'CURE' GAY PEOPLE

‘One person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say ‘‘OK, you can do it”. You have a homsexual who says ‘‘I’m homosexual, actually I’d rather be straight, is there a way of fixing it?’’'

ON PAEDOPHILIA

'If a few people in the Met Police are racist, people say it's institutionally racist; if I say hundreds of Catholic priests are paedophiles, it's terrible'

AND ON PROSPECT OF A BLACK PM

'I wouldn't panic'

ROBERT JENRICK

Christie's director with top lawyer wife - they make no apologies for working hard for their money

Tory candidate Robert Jenrick rejects claims that he has covered up his and his wife’s £5 million property portfolio and £500,000-a-year joint earnings to try to win  the Newark seat.

Mr Jenrick presents himself as a ‘father, local man, son  of a secretary and small businessman and state primary school-educated’ candidate.

But that is not quite the whole story.

In fact, he and American wife Michal own not one, but two, £2 million homes in London and a £1 million country pile built by an 18th Century slave-trader.

Their Newark ‘home’ is a  rented house obtained when he was picked as a candidate six months ago.

And his Party CV omits to say he went to a £13,000-a-year private secondary school.

Together with his director’s  job at Christie’s auction house, it is just the type of posh Tory boy image Cameron and co can’t shrug off.

Mr Jenrick, who looks even younger than his 32 years, sticks rigidly to his Tory HQ autocue when asked about national issues.

During our interview at a cafeteria in Tuxford, near Newark, he is finally stirred when I ask whether, in his keenness to come across as a regular guy, he has misled voters.

To win the candidacy, he promised he would move his family lock, stock and barrel to Newark. A 250-mile round-trip  to Westminster if he becomes  MP – quite a commute for a  self-proclaimed family man  with two young daughters.

How many nights has the family actually spent in their Newark ‘home?’

‘Er, it has grown over time.’  He won’t say.

His election leaflets are also silent about the couple’s £2 million flat in Marylebone, London. It went up in value by £300,000 last year, more than twice the average price of a home in Newark.

Last October, the couple splashed out an extra £2.5 million on a house in fashionable Vincent Square, Westminster, less than a mile from Parliament, which  they plan to move into soon.

On top of that they bought Grade I listed Eye Manor in Herefordshire for £1.1 million  in 2009.

Mr Jenrick says he is ‘almost sure’ they will sell it and move to Newark if he becomes MP.

It is to be hoped this interview is not the first Mrs Jenrick, a top commercial lawyer whose professional name is Michal Berkner, eight years Mr Jenrick’s senior, has heard of that.

Despite appearances, he says  he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and cites  his education at 500-year-old independent school Wolverhampton Grammar  as proof.

‘There was no way my parents could afford to send me to private school. My grandma Dorothy paid the fees.’ Then why no mention of any of it in his  Tory CV? What does he know about life on the breadline?

‘That’s not fair. None of it was inherited or handed on a plate to us. My wife and I have both worked jolly hard,’ he insists.

‘I don’t need to have a disabled daughter to know what it’s like.

‘I don’t need to have lost a child in Afghanistan to meet somebody who has and have empathy and support them.’

He could easily have carried  on enjoying ‘earning money  and having nice homes’ but sacrificed it all in a bid to  become an MP.

Come off it, he can afford to because his wife earns approaching half-a-million a year with US law firm Skadden and can pay all the bills.

‘I’m not going to apologise for that. I’m proud of her,’ Mr Jenrick says.
