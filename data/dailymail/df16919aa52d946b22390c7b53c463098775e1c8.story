The former poster boy of America's so-called 'ex-gay' movement who last year left his wife to return to homosexuality has launched a scathing attack on Rick Perry, declaring: 'You don’t understand this issue at all'.

John Paulk - once the nation's leading advocate of so-called gay conversion therapy - issued the verbal assault after the Texas governor compared homosexuality to alcoholism in an interview earlier this month.

Perry was forced to apologise after he suggested that a gay person in a same-sex relationship is no different to an alcoholic who chooses to drink.

'Whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that,' Perry told The San Francisco Chronicle. 'I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.'

Now Paulk, from Portland, Oregon, hit out at the politician in a comment feature for Politico Magazine.

'This wasn’t just some political mistake,' writes Paulk. 'What worries me more is the ignorance betrayed by Perry’s comments - an ignorance that I believe is still widespread among conservatives in the straight world - about what being gay means.'

Sparking controversy: Perry's original comments came during a conversation about 'reparative therapy' that Texas Republicans formally endorsed in their party platform this week.

'Gay for Life?' Paulk became such a well-known figure in the 'ex-gay movement' that he even appeared on the front cover of Newsweek magazine in 1998 alongside wife Anne beneath the headline, 'Gay for Life?'  

Perry’s 
original comments came during a conversation about 'reparative therapy' 
that Texas Republicans formally endorsed in their party platform this 
week.

Practitioners
 of the controversial treatment - also called 'gay conversion therapy' - 
claim to be able to turn homosexuals straight with a variety of 
techniques that critics argue are both psychologically damaging and 
ineffective.

Techniques
 include electric shock therapy, inducing nausea 
while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to 
brothels to have sex with women and hypnosis.

But Paulk has now completely abandoned the movement, vowing instead to fight the 'widespread misunderstanding in the straight world' that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.

'I do not want young gay women and men today to go through what I went through,' he writes. 'I want to tell them - and Rick Perry: We are not broken, damaged, inferior or throwaways. We are created in the image of God - just like everyone else.'

Of his own past, he writes: 'I was in denial. It wasn’t
 in fact true, any of it. Worse than being wrong, it was harmful to many
 people - and caused me years of pain in my own life. Which is why I 
have this to say to the Rick Perrys of the world: You don’t understand 
this issue. At all.'

During
 the 1990s, Paulk became the most visible proponent of 'reparative 
therapy' claiming it had 'healed' him, allowing him to marry Anne and have three children.

He
 became such a well-known figure in the 'ex-gay movement' that he even 
appeared on the front cover of Newsweek magazine in 1998 alongside wife 
Ann.

But last year, he revealed that he was in fact gay after all and had left the movement.

'My
 beliefs have changed,’ he told PQ Monthly, which stands for Proud 
Queer. 'Today, I do not consider myself “ex-gay” and I no longer support
 or promote the movement.'

It
 was a huge departure from Paulk’s prime ex-gay days, when he founded 
and ran a ministry called Love Won Out based on ‘reparative therapy.’

Paulk
 also penned two books on the subject: Not Afraid To Change: The 
Remarkable Story Of How One Man Overcame Homosexuality and Love Won Out,
 which he wrote with his wife, who also claimed to have rid herself of 
her own homosexuality.

He wrote the piece after the Texas Republican party revealed they are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to 'cure' homosexuality.

'Reparative therapy is, by definition, based on the notion that something
 is “broken” in one’s identity, needing repair,' he writes. 'You are meant to feel 
like damaged goods, and the therapy is designed to fix that.'

He goes on: 'In a 
nutshell, gay conversion advocates argue that boys who grow up to be gay
 over-identify with their mothers and remain detached from uninvolved, 
weak, passive, disinterested fathers.'

Treatments for 'curing' homosexuality claim to change a person's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy, inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material, praying, exorcism, trips to brothels to have sex with women, and hypnosis.

Some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same-sex attractions.

The American Psychological Association have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm.

Gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people, because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are.

The largest Christian ministry engaged in such work, Exodus International, also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting 'years of undue suffering.'

California and New Jersey have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight, and both laws have been upheld in court.

'I was told by my Christian mentor that one thing I needed to do to increase my sense of masculinity was to quit my job as a chocolatier because I was surrounded by too many women,' he writes. 'My mentor suggested I get a job in the business world where there were more men.'

He remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until September of 2000, when he was photographed in a Washington DC gay bar.

By 2012 he could not live the lie any longer.

'I deeply loved my wife, Anne, who still believed in the movement, and I knew it would be extremely scandalous to embrace homosexuality after the career I’d had,' he writes. 'But it was more and more apparent to me that I was what I always had been: gay.'

In the end he decided to abandon his old life and 'come out' for a second time.

'Today, for the first time since I was a young man, I’m not living a double life - a life that is a lie, day in and day out. I have no more secrets than the next person,' he adds.

Paulk now supports himself
 in the food service industry, running a catering company in Portland, 
Oregon called Mezzaluna Catering, and says he no longer profits from his
 former job.

At their annual conference in Fort Worth on Saturday, the Texan Republican party adopted the policy of 'reparative therapy', which tea party groups had advocated.

One
 particularly influential group, the Texas Eagle Forum, had urged the 
party to support the psychological treatments, which claim to try and 
turn homosexuals straight.

President of the conservative group, Texas Values Jonathan Saenz welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise.

He 
explained: 'The platform reflects what the people in the Republican 
Party have asked for, and that should be no surprise: family values, 
protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that
 goes along with that.'

But
 adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the
 Republican party, some of whom had been lined up to speak out against 
endorsing such therapy.

They never got the chance to address delegates, because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first.

Rudy
 Oeftering, vice president of the gay conservative group Metroplex 
Republicans, who was due to speak said: 'There's a very, very small 
group of people who want to keep the party in the past. We were here 
today to try to pull the party into the future.

'The only 
way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young 
people, to start listening to people who have gay family members.'
