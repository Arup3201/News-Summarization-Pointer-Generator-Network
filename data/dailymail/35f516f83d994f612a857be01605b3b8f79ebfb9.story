Wolfsburg are lining up a £23million bid for Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle.

Jose Mourinho has underlined that the Germany international needs to improve his physical shape and the striker has been placed on a bespoke fitness programme to help cope with the rigours of the Premier League.

World Cup winner Schurrle has seen his opportunities limited this season, having started just five Premier League games. 

Wolfsburg want to take Andre Schurrle back to Germany and are readying a £23million bid

Schurrle has struggled for form and game-time at Chelsea this season

The 24-year-old suffered with a mystery illness early in the season which he believed contributed to his poor form and he remained a peripheral figure over the festive period.

In his last two appearances for Chelsea, against Southampton on 28 December and in the FA Cup third-round victory over Watford, Mourinho opted to take him off at half-time.

Ambitious Wolfsburg sense a deal can be done and want to test the Premier League leaders resolve.

They believe Schurrle, who joined for £18m from Bayer Leverkusen in 2013, is keen to move.

The World Cup winner has only started five Premier League games this season
