An iPhone case has been developed with a built-in breathalyser.

Users breathe into a test hole in the case and readings pop up on a display seconds later.

Hiroyasu Yamamitsu, boss of Japanese firm Thanko which created the device, said: ‘After drinking  alcohol it’s difficult to know whether people can drive a car or not.

‘People need to check if they’re safe to drive and there’s nothing more convenient than having one built in to your phone’s case.’

However, the case should not be used as a standalone device to determine a safe driving limit, the firm warned.

To get a blood alcohol reading from the Japanese Alcohol Checker case, pictured, users blow onto the test hole on the back of the case for up to five seconds. After 20 seconds, the reading, measured in grams per litre appears on a small display, shown as a percentage

The display will also light up red, pictured left, or green, pictured right, to warn people if they're over the driving limit, or it is safe to get in the car. When the screen glows yellow, users are borderline over the limit and should stop drinking and wait a while before checking the reading again, and getting in the car

Illinois-based Mipwr Dynamo cases 
connect to an iPhone's battery charging point and contain a hidden push 
lever that when squeezed creates an electrical charge.

The
 electricity is created by electromagnetic conduction inside the case 
and a minute of squeezing produces around 30 seconds of charge.

The UK drink driving limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

The device works once users have blown into the case for three to five seconds.

After 20 seconds the reading is  displayed as a percentage on the back of the case.

The display also lights up red, yellow or green to warn people if they’re over the safe driving limit.

If the screen glows red, it means it is not safe to drive, while a green screen means driving will be within the legal limit.

When
 the screen glows yellow, users are bordering on being over the limit 
and should stop drinking and wait a while before checking the reading 
again, Thanko explained.  

To enable the breathalyser, the user can click the Check Alcohol button on the app.

The Alcohol Checker case also charges a phone using a built-in 1,800 mAh battery.

The case works in the same way as a docking station and users can switch between using the phone's battery, to using the power in the case.

The breathalyser is powered completely by the case, too, meaning it doesn't use up the handset's battery life.

It weighs 72 grams and is 15mm thick.

The current model has been designed to fit the iPhone 5, but the firm is working on versions for other phones.
