Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest big name to pour a bucket of freezing iced water over his head in the name of charity - and has challenged Bill Gates to be next.

The 30-year-old billionaire was taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge, which was launched by the ALS Association to raise money for fighting ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

He looked unfazed as he tipped the huge tub of frosty water over his head, before reflecting for a moment and picking the Microsoft tycoon among his nominees for people to try it next.

He laughed as he stood soaked through in his back garden, and also picked Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings for the challenge.

'You guys have 24 hours to complete the challenge or you have to donate to the ALS foundation - or both,' he wrote in the video's caption on his Facebook page 

The Ice Bucket Challenge is the brainchild of former Division 1 baseball player Peter Frates, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012.

It first took off in Boston, where the 29-year-old played, but has quickly spread all over the world, raising more than $4m for the ALS Association.

Partakers simply film themselves pouring a bucket of ice cold water over their heads and then share it on social media, nominating friends to do the same. 

The forfeit is donating money to the foundation, though those that do take it on are also encouraged to donate. 

Zuckerberg was nominated for the stunt by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who proved again that he doesn't mind a little humiliation.

The 51-year-old Republican posted a video on his Facebook page on Tuesday showing two of his children dumping the bucket of ice water over his head. 

The ALS Association reports raising more than $4m since July 29 thanks to the initiative, which has seen several celebrities take part.

Singers Justin Timberlake and Adam Levine, the Kennedys, Mickey Rourke and golf stars Ian Poulter and Greg Norman are among those to soak themselves for charity, while late night TV host Jimmy Fallon has accepted Christie's nomination.

President Obama unfortunately declined Ethel Kennedy's nomination, but did pledge to donate money to the foundation. 

In the UK, the idea has also been adopted by Macmillan Cancer support, who are encouraging people to donate £3 when they complete the challenge.
