West Ham forward Ravel Morrison has denied threatening to have his former girlfriend murdered for £10,000, a Manchester Crown Court has heard.

Morrison has also been charged with harassing his former partner Reah Mansoor over a four-and-a-half-year period and assaulting her mother, Parveen Mansoor at a preliminary hearing on Thursday. 

Morrison is also accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of Miss Mansoor. He has denied the charges.

Bailed: A provisional trial date has been set for January. Morrison must not enter Greater Manchester except for court appearances and when playing for West Ham

A provisional trial date has now been set for January 26, and Morrison, who appeared in the dock in a black leather jacket, white shirt and blue jeans, has been bailed on the condition he does not make direct or indirect contact with the two alleged victims. 

He must also not enter the Greater Manchester area except for court appearances or when on 'an official West Ham United football match'.

The former Manchester United youngster was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother in the early hours of July 27 in Salford.

Morrison made his first appearance of the season in West Ham's Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield United 

Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

Hammers manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. He made his first appearance of the season in West Ham’s Capital One Cup clash against Sheffield United earlier this week, which they lost on penalties.
