An extra 110,000 patients have been admitted to hospital with cold-related illnesses largely because of rising energy prices, Labour is set to claim today.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, will blame the Government’s failure to get to grips with the ‘cost of living crisis’ for the raised admissions to A&E.

In a speech about the NHS in Birmingham today, he will link the raised admissions for respiratory and circulatory problems with the £300 rise in the average energy bill.

The figure is a 10 per cent increase on the year before the coalition came to power.

He will say: ‘These new figures show for the first 
time the effect on A&E of the cost of living crisis and rising 
energy bills.

'This is the tragic human cost of David Cameron’s failure to
 stand up to the energy companies.’

In a speech on the state of the 
NHS, Mr Burnham will also say: ‘The Government has allowed A&E to 
come under siege from all sides to the point where it is now in danger 
of being overwhelmed.

‘A&E today is becoming the last resort for 
millions of people who are struggling to cope with the cost of living 
crisis and cuts to community services. This explains why the current 
financial year is set to be the worst in A&E for at least a decade.

‘Severe
 cuts to NHS community services, mental health and social care are 
pushing people needlessly to A&E which in turn needs even more staff
 to cope. This short-sighted approach has trapped the NHS in a vicious 
circle, with hospitals paying huge sums to staff agencies for short-term
 A&E cover.’

Labour’s analysis says that 1,176,353 people went to A&E with circulatory and respiratory problems in 2012/13, up from 1,067,134 in 2009/10 – a difference of 109,219.

A Department for Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘Last winter had particularly long periods of cold weather, and all across Europe we saw increased cases of flu and respiratory conditions.

‘This Government is working to help vulnerable people with their energy bills.’

A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Labour’s desperate campaign to run down A&Es is wearing thin.

‘More elderly people need healthcare as the population ages yet even with this big increase in demand, hospitals are seeing more patients within four hours than ever before and have already hit their target more weeks than they did the winter when Andy Burnham was Health Secretary.’
