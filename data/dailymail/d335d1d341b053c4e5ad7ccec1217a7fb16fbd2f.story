Shocking claims: Cynthia Kaye Wood, 19, from Texas, has been charged with attempted capital murder for allegedly making two separate attempts to kill her 4-month-old son 

A teenage mother from Texas has been arrested for allegedly trying to suffocate her baby son twice while the child was being treated at a local hospital.

Cynthia Kaye Wood, 19, from Galena Park, has been charged with attempted capital murder.

According to court documents, Wood called 911 September 30 to report that her 4-month-old son stopped breathing,

The infant was taken to LBJ Hospital and was later transferred to Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital.

On October 12, Ms Wood called a nurse saying that her son was struggling to draw a breath.

Once the young mother was reassured that her son was fine, she retired to the couch in the room to watch Law & Order, according to ABC 13 Eyewitness News.

The 19-year-old later told police that she was watching TV and eating M&Ms when she heard her son making gurgling and gasping noises.

Wood said she pick up the boy and began hitting him on the back.

A nurse said she came into Wood's room after the baby's vitals alarm went off and found the mother holding her son's limp body in her arms.

The hospital staffer said Wood was the only person in the room at the time, and she did not raise the alarm about her son's medical emergency.

The nurse went to work on the baby, performing CPR on him until he was resuscitated. Court records show that the 4-month-old experienced clinical death before being revived.

According to  documents cited by Houston Chronicle, surveillance cameras inside the hospital room captured Wood on two separate occasions by placing her hand over her son's mouth and pinching his nose shut as the little boy tried to fight back, kicking his legs furiously.

Brush with death: The incidents took place at Children's Memorial Hermann hospital, where nurses were able to revive the little boy 

In one instance, prosecutors said the 19-year-old stuck a pacifier in her son's mouth and then covered his face with a blanket.

A doctor who later examined the child said he had no underlying medical problem, suggesting that only Wood's alleged actions were to blame for his brush with death. 

During a court hearing Monday, a prosecutor revealed that Wood had another baby who died in Mississippi. The circumstances of the child’s death remain unknown at this time.

A judge set Cynthia Wood’s bond at $250,000 and ordered her to stay away from her son. If convicted, she could face up to a life in prison.
