Federal prosecutors plan to use declassified documents recovered during the 2011 raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound during the trial of Abid Naseer, pictured,  in Brooklyn Federal Court

The trial of British a man who allegedly planned terrorist attacks on UK and American targets is to consider documents seized from the hideout of Osama bin Laden.

Abid Naseer, 28, is to go on trial next month accused of plotting with other Al Qaeda operatives to blow up subway lines in Manhattan during rush hour around the eighth anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

US officials plan to use the secret documents which were seized when the terrorist leader was shot dead after US Navy Seals stormed his compound in Pakistan in 2011, as part of prosecution evidence.

Naseer, from Manchester, is also facing charges in the US related to terror attacks on shoppers at the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester in 2009, and a further plot against trargets in Norway.

His alleged planned attack in Manchester was referred to in coded messages intercepted by MI5 as ‘the wedding’ and was to have taken place when the stores were at their busiest.

Pakistani national Naseer was arrested with 12 others in April 2009 after UK police uncovered the alleged plot.

But all were released without charge because of lack of evidence.

Naseer was extradited to the US in January 2013 following a two-year legal fight after officials linked him to three men suspected of the subway bombing plot.

A British judge ruled that he could not be sent back to Pakistan as he might face torture but he would get a fair trial in the US.

Details of the bin Laden documents, which were seized from his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, were revealed during a pre-trial hearing at Brooklyn federal court.

It will the first time any material from the dead terror leader’s hideout have been used in a US terror trial.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zainab Ahmad told a court the US Government plan to declassify the documents for use in the trial.

Naseer, who is defending himself, refused to study the Bin Laden document on Wednesday when given the opportunity.

US authorities allege Medunjanin and his former high school friends Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay travelled to Pakistan in 2008 to seek terror training from Al Qaeda.

Zazi and Ahmeddzay have pleaded guilty and awaiting sentencing and Menunjanin is serving a life sentence.

Naseer faces life if found guilty.
