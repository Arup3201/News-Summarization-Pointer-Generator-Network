'Poor reception': Andrew Partridge felled 11 of his neighbour's trees and damaged another 21

A fuming neighbour was so annoyed about the poor signal his television was receiving that he cut down the trees he thought were responsible for it.

Andrew Partridge felled 11 of his neighbour's trees and damaged another 21 near his house because he thought they were interfering with his channel reception.

The 30-foot high Scots pine trees he cut down were growing on agricultural land backing on to his home and he has now been ordered by a court to pay the landowner £2,500 in compensation.

However this figure could rise again if civil action is taken against 55-year-old Partridge to recoup more of the £17,000 of damage he caused to the trees.

Partridge was also given 80 hours community service at Norwich Crown Court.

The court heard that Partridge had been warned several times in the past to stop cutting back the trees - which he ignored - and was even personally asked by the landowner Julian Taylor, whose farm backs on to Partridge's house.

Mr Taylor, a seventh-generation arable farmer in Starston, Norfolk, said after the hearing that it will take between 15 and 20 years to repair the damage caused to the belt of mature trees.

He also suggested he might pursue a civil claim against Partridge.

He said: 'The compensation covers some of the damage but not the loss of amenity. We will have to go back to our lawyers and see if it is worth chasing.

'We would like to get on and replant this autumn so the screen has a chance of growing back as quickly as possible.'

Destroyed: The 30-foot high Scots pine trees were growing on agricultural land backing on to Partridge's home. It could take between 15 and 20 years to repair the damage, which has cost more than £17,000

Partridge, of Harleston, Norfolk, told the court - via his solicitors - that he felled the trees to help his neighbours.

Despite the court hearing how the total damage was more than £17,500, Partridge, who used to be a HGV driver, was only ordered to pay £2,500 and given the community sentence, as he is out-of-work and has no assets.

Judge Alasdair Darroch said: 'That may still happen to you. You had no right to do what you did.'

The judge also told him he should not have denied the criminal damage charge, adding: 'It was a great pity you 
chose to defend this action. You had absolutely no defence and no 
business to cut down the trees.'

Partridge made no comment after the case.

Mr Taylor said he had noticed branches on his belt of mature trees were gradually being cut down, but he had no idea who it was until he spotted Partridge in 2009.

He also said he believed Partridge's motives were to create a view from his property.

He told the BBC: 'He made some lame excuse that he needed to improve his television reception.

'The fact was he was clearing the branches from the ground up to about 25ft, which was really, I think, so that he could get a view out to the west.'

Mr Taylor, who is also vice-chairman of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, said he hoped the case would serve as a warning to

He added: 'If he had stopped the first time or even the second time I asked, we wouldn't have asked for a prosecution to take place.'

Mr Taylor, a farmer and vice-chairman of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, said he hoped the sentence would send out a warning to others in the same situation.
