Listening to the radio, singing along to the latest chart-topper, people often find themselves red-faced having to mumble a line or two.

But, it turns out, struggling to catch every word of your favourite song is nothing to be ashamed of, with 65 percent of people admitting they can’t follow the lyrics of modern pop hits.

And it’s not only contemporary groups that have fans straining to hear, with The Beatles, Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie also singled out in a new survey revealing the lyrics that most confuse British listeners.

The Beatles song 'I am the Walrus' was voted as having the second most confusing lyrics by 27 per cent of Brits in a survey by Blinkbox music

The line which left the largest number 
of people (30%) scratching their heads was, ‘Are we human, or are we 
dancer?’ from the song Human by American rock group The Killers, which 
reached number three in the UK charts.

The band’s lead singer Brandon Flowers has previously said the odd line was inspired by a quote from journalist Hunter S. Thompson: ‘We’re raising a generation of dancers,’ critiquing the conformity of modern society.

The frontman told MTV: ‘It’s taken from a quote by Thompson: “We’re raising a generation of dancers,” and I took it and ran. I guess it bothers people that it’s not grammatically correct, but I think I’m allowed to do whatever I want.’

The Killers were voted as having the most confusing lyrics of all in their song with the line 'Are we human, or are we dancer?' from the tune Human

'What about elephants? Have we lost their trust?': Michael Jackson's Earth Song left 18 per cent of Brits confused

Second 
place was taken by The Beatles, with 27 percent of people failing to 
grasp the famously confusing line: ‘I am the eggman, they are the 
eggman, I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob’, from their 1967 song I Am The 
Walrus, the B-side to their number one hit Hello, Goodbye.

1.‘Are we human, or are we dancer?’ – The Killers, Human - 30%

2.‘I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob’ – The Beatles, I Am The Walrus - 27%

3.‘What about elephants? Have we lost their trust?’- Michael Jackson, Earth Song - 18%

4.‘Tom bol li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo’ - Lionel Richie, All Night Long - 12%

5.‘Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad’ - Carly Rae Jepson, Call Me Maybe -11%

6.‘Beats so big I’m stepping on leprechauns’ - Black Eyed Peas, Boom Boom Pow - 10%

7.‘The reflex is an only child, he’s waiting in the park’ - Duran Duran, The Reflex - 8%

8.‘Club Tropicana, drinks are free, fun and sunshine, there’s enough for everyone, all that’s missing is the sea’ - Wham!, Club Tropicana – 8%

9.‘Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter, and my daddy said stay away from Juliet.’ – Taylor Swift, Love Story - 7%

10.‘Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball’-Oasis, Champagne Supernova-7%

There
 have been several explanations put forward for the unusual lyrics, but 
Martin Cloonan, professor of popular music politics at Glasgow 
University, said: ‘John Lennon spoke of writing some of this while on an
 acid trip, which might help explain things.

‘It is an 
exercise in surrealism and word play – a true highlight of UK 
psychedelia. Lennon did once declare that ‘The Walrus was Paul’ but it 
appears to in fact be a reference to Lewis Carroll’s The Walrus and the 
Carpenter and so, a reference to surreal or imaginary worlds.’

Lennon
 himself told Playboy magazine in an interview that the song was part of
 his ‘[Bob] Dylanesque period’ which was characterised by ‘the trick of 
never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more. 
Where more or less can be read into it. It’s a good game.’

Michael Jackson completes the top three,
 with 18 percent of people struggling with the Earth Song lyrics: ‘What 
about the elephants? Have we lost their trust?’

The famously eccentric Jackson wrote Earth Song, which reached number one in the UK charts, as a protest over his concerns regarding animal welfare and the environment but it is branded ‘misjudged’ by Professor Cloonan.

Explaining the words 'Tom bo li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo,' in Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, Professor Cloonan said: 'Richie has himself admitted that the lyrics are ‘a wonderful joke’ and an attempt to insert some African dialect into the song, which he couldn’t do in time, so just made up. They have no meaning outside of sounding right in the song.'

Gobbledegook: Ever sang 'Tom bol li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo' from Lionel Richie's song All Night Long and wondered what you were saying? If so then you're not alone - 12 per cent of Brits polled said they didn't have the foggiest either

But he admitted he was baffled by the Black Eyed Peas 'Beats so big I'm stepping on leprechauns'.

He said: 'Sometimes I think we just have to accept songwriters are strange.'

When asked for their reasons for failing to follow the songs, 40 percent of people said it was because they simply could not make out the words, 27 percent said the lack of logic made them think they had misheard the lyrics, while ten percent said the use of slang puzzled them.

Almost two-thirds (64 percent) said the problem had become worse over time.

Despite the issue, 28 percent said that not understanding all the lyrics to a song would not stop them from enjoying it.

This is borne out by the fact that, out of the ten songs voted to have the most confusing lines, nine made it into the UK top ten – the exception is Oasis’s Champagne Supernova – including four number ones.

The poll, conducted by blinkbox music, also asked people to vote for the modern pop star with the worst lyrics.

Miley Cyrus came first with 17 percent of the vote, followed by the rapper Pitbull, American pop star Robin Thicke, The Voice judge Will.i.am and his group The Black Eyed Peas, Sting, country singer Taylor Swift, Robbie Williams, Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon, Noel Gallagher and Brandon Flowers of The Killers.
