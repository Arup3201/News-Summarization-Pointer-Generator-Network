The NYPD detective arrested over his alleged role in the gang bike attack on a family in their SUV had worked undercover in the Occupy Wall St movement for two years, it was revealed today.

Detective Wojciech Braszczok - who also told activists his real name was 'Al' - shaved his head into a mohawk and apparently pretended to be a biker bro to win the trust of activists. He attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors.

He appeared in court today over his involvement with a bike gang that chased down Manhattan father Alexian Lien, 33, and pulled him from his Range Rover in front of his wife and two-year-old child after he allegedly ran over one of his biker buddies.

But despite the seriousness of the claims against him, a judge agreed with Braszczok's lawyer that pictures of him in court should not be allowed. 

John Arlia said that he was involved with the NYPD intelligence division which deals with 'infiltrating various organizations' and 'to disclose his identity would jeopardize his life, his families'.

For that reason MailOnline has obscured his identity.

Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree.

Wearing beige army combat short and a black hoodie, he did not speak during the five minute hearing at Manhattan's Criminal Court today.

He was released after his legal team said they could post a $100,000 cash bail bond.

The court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family.

The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break.

He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back.

The criminal complaint also alleges that at the time of the assault he was wearing a black vest with the words 'Front Line Soldiers' and 'New Rochelle, NY' on it.

His name, 'WOJTEK' was on the front too.

Shocking: Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree

Mr Arlia also denied that Braszczok, who was riding a bright red Yamaha bike, went within 12ft of the car and that the video of the incident will exonerate his client who he said was being targeted because he was a detective.

He will next appear before the court on Friday

The revelation that Braszczok, 32, of Queens, New York, was embedded with Occupy will likely spark a new row with the movement which has taken the NYPD to court repeatedly over what it claims is abusive treatment.

It also raises questions over whether or not Braszczok got so into his alternative lifestyle that he 'went rogue'. 

Rabble rousing: Braszczok tweeted Occupy events including this 'spring training' event in April, 2012

Rogue? It is unclear how much of Braszczok's online personalities were part of his cover or his genuine lifestyle

NBC New York was the first to report Braszczok's work with Occupy and said that he has spent 10 years within the force, the last five of which were undercover.

MailOnline has conducted an extensive trawl of his presence on the web which supports the claim.

His Twitter account makes him seem every inch the committed activist though it only has 74 tweets dating from April 2010 to May this year.

Braszczok posted tweets in which he boasted of attending Occupy and Anonymous events including one dubbed ‘Spring Training’.

On April 9 this year he Tweeted: ‘Noise demo 500 pearl st, ny ny, we need more ppl. So come by’.

The event was at the Metropolitan Correction Center in downtown Manhattan to show support for Jeremy Hammond’s who was arrested for the Anonymous hack that released private security firm Stratfor’s documents to WikiLeaks.

Some 20 members of Occupy attended and, according to Occupy activist Clark Stoeckley, Braszczok may have been acting as a 'provocateur' to turn it into something more.

On November 30 last year Braszczok Tweeted: ‘Hey is the *SANDY SPECIAL PART 3* REBUILDING OCCUPY TO CONNECT, MOBILIZE AND CO-CREATE WITH, assembly Happening at 60 wall today’

And on April 6 last year he also Tweeted: ‘Come join us in spring training by occupying the stock exchange today at 2:30pm. Hope to see you there’.

The event was documented on YouTube and shows a number of protestors standing with placards under the watch of a few dozen NYPD cops.

On April 1, Braszczok, whose family are Polish, uploaded the picture of the NYPD helicopter as it apparently monitored them.

Braszczok's online personal life could also well be part of his cover. But on other sites he writes of his love for fast bikes, fast women and fast cars.

On a Photobucket page that corresponds to his email address is a picture of a woman wearing red lingerie. 

He also says he is 'attractive', athletic and 6’1”. He also tweeted under a handle name that references his love of fast cars.

Braszczok is also an avid gamer and has scores listed on a World of Warcraft website and one for Dragonblight. Both are hugely popular role-playing games.

Elsewhere he has posted a photo of a cigar that he likes to enjoy and bragged about still being out with friends past 4am to see DJs like Carl Cox at swanky Manhattan club Cielo.

On a dating website he describes himself as single and says he has two children - there are pictures of two on his mother’s Facebook page.

On his MySpace page profile picture he is showing off his torso but he has no time for unattractive women and once tweeted: ‘Why these obese girl think they could wear all this sexy costumes made for skinny bitches...’

Braszczok also set up a Ustream website called ‘Pornshare’ but does not appear to have done anything with it.

Hunt: The NYPD are looking for four bikers involved in the vicious assault on a family driving through Manhattan on September 29

Several members of the motorcycle gang are being sought out for questioning by the NYPD 

MailOnline has reached out to the NYPD for comment.

If it is offically confirmed that Braszczok had infiltrated Occupy for the NYPD, it could spark another lawsuit against the force.

New York City agreed to pay $232,000 to cover the cost of the library it destroyed when police raided Zuccotti Park to bring an end to Occupy Wall St last year.

Protesters have also sued after they were sprayed with mace and for the mass arrest on Brooklyn Bridge which took place during the occupation of the park.

In addition to Braszczok, Craig Wright, 29, is accused of beating Lien and Allen Edwards, 43, is said to have punched one of his car windows.

Clint Caldwell, 32, has been charged with gang assault and criminal mischief.

Christoper Cruz, 28, who allegedly started the altercation when he slowed down and forced Lien to bump him has denied he was to blame.

Police are searching for at least two more suspects. One of the bikers who Lien allegedly run over has been left paralyzed, his family claim.
