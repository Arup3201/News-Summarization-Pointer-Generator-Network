Blue star Lee Ryan unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade at police officers before urinating on the floor of a police cell after he was arrested for drink driving, a court has heard.

But he blamed his meltdown on the torrent of online abuse he received in the wake of his controversial appearance on Celebrity Big Brother.

The All Rise singer was handed a £3,325 fine and banned from the roads for two years after admitting failing to provide a specimen and causing £120 of criminal damage.

Arriving at Ealing Magistrates' Court this morning, the Celebrity Big Brother star, was flanked by his bandmates Duncan James, Simon Webbe and Antony Costa.

Ryan had been out celebrating the birthday of bandmate Duncan James hours before he was arrested in Ealing and taken to Acton police station

The court in west London, heard Ryan had been out partying to celebrate his best friend and bandmate Duncan James's birthday on the night of his arrest.

Officers spotted Ryan swerving erratically at 5.30am on April 11 as he drove his female friend's Audi A3 on the Uxbridge Road in Ealing.

There was an empty bottle in a pocket by the driver's seat and he stank of alcohol and slurred his words as he got out of the driver's seat.

Majit Mahal, prosecuting, said: 'Officers could immediately smell alcohol from Mr Ryan's breath and his eyes appeared glazed.

'Asked if he had consumed some alcohol that night, Mr Ryan said "Yes, a few".

'Officers then noticed that there was an empty bottle in the pocket of the driver's seat. When Mr Ryan exited the vehicle, he was obviously unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred.'

He was in such a 'drunken state' that officers took him straight to the police station.

But he refused to take a breath test to see if he was over the limit and repeatedly swore at officers, branding one a 'c***'.

Mr Mahal said that when officers warned Ryan he would be prosecuted if he did not provide a specimen, he replied 'F*** off'.

Ryan then shouted: 'F*** off, f*** you, you f****** c****, f*** off.'

The slurring star became aggressive to officers and was marched to a cell at Acton police station where he urinated and was sick all over the floor.

When officers returned later they saw urine trickling under the door into the hallway.

Quizzed over why he soiled the cell, Ryan replied 'I didn't realise there was a toilet here'.

Asked by the officer 'Do you do this at home?', he said 'Yes I do, f*** off you c****'.

In a police interview later that day, Ryan told officers he had drunk a vodka and tonic and a rum and Coke, but thought he was ok to drive.

He told officers he was on antidepressant medication and antibiotics, which he blamed for his state.

Mr Mahal said: 'He believed his drink may have been spiked, because normally he would have been fine.

'Officers explained to Mr Ryan that his conduct towards officers had been abusive and he was challenged about the language he used.

'Mr Ryan said he had no memory of the conduct or the words he is alleged to have used.'

Ryan pleaded guilty to the charges, but defence lawyers blamed the troubled star's outburst on the stress he has been under since he left the Celebrity Big Brother house in January this year.

Peter Ratliff, defending, told the court: 'There can be no doubt that decision (to take part in Celebrity Big Brother) was a mistake.

'When he left the Big Brother house he felt that some of the print media had turned against him.

'He was subjected to visceral and unpleasant attacks in the media.'

He said Ryan had received '140 pages of Twitter abuse - abuse that in another era would be unfathomable. He received death threats. He received abuse from members of the public.'

The singer had been left 'shattered' by the stinging criticism and that goes 'some way in prompting this crash in his behaviour', Mr Ratliff said.

On the night of the outburst he had become 'genuinely upset' after a woman approached him and 'called him an arsehole and asked him if he was that prick from the telly', the court heard.

Mr Ratliff said the Ryan, who is heavily in debt, is 'disgusted' at his actions.

The singer, who suffers from depression, had seen doctors at the Priory hospital and a Harley Street clinic in the months just before the incident.

And he checked into residential rehab clinic Capio Nightingale hospital in Marylebone, west London, afterwards.

Wearing a three-piece dark grey suit, white shirt and black tie with his blond hair quiffed, the singer nodded as his sentence was read.

He was supported in court by all three members of Blue, who wore black suits and sat in the public gallery at the back of court.

Ryan was told his two-year driving ban would be cut to 18 months if he completes a drink-driving course.

In a statement released after the sentencing, the singer thanked his fans for their support.

It said: 'Lee respects the court's decision today and takes full responsibility for his actions.

'This has been an important lesson for Lee as he works towards a healthier and happier new chapter in his life.'

Speaking shortly after the arrest, a
 Met Police spokesperson told The Sun: ‘Police stopped a car after 
officers witnessed it being driven erratically. The driver was arrested 
on suspicion of drink driving and taken into custody.

‘He was subsequently further arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs and criminal damage.'

A
 Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'A 30-year-old man was arrested 
with possession of Class A drugs on the same night, he was bailed to a 
date in June.'

Lee was previously banned from driving and was fined £2,250 as a consequence of drink driving in 2003.

On
 31 December 2007, he was arrested for an assault on a taxi driver in 
Oxted, Surrey. He was released on bail until February 2008.

In
 August of 2010, Ryan was charged with assault after allegedly hitting 
his then fiancee Samantha Millar. The charges were later dropped, and 
the couple separated.

Ryan found fame in 2000 with Blue, who went on to sell 3.3 million albums and a million singles in the UK, and was recently involved in a love triangle during Celebrity Big Brother.

In the last year Blue reportedly made just £77 despite the release of a new album and a nationwide tour

Blue have reportedly made just £77 in the last year which saw them release a new album and go on a nationwide tour.

The
 company of the band made £80 in 2013 compared to £3 the year before, 
according to The Sun.

But despite the abysmal profit, Blueworld Touring No. 1 Ltd is still allegedly £1,566 in debt.

‘The figures are embarrassing,’ a music industry source told Dan Wootton of The Sun. ‘Especially with their recent TV exposure.’

Blue
 reunited on the ITV series The Big Reunion, where they joined other 
noughties bands like B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, 5ive and Liberty X on a 
nationwide tour.

In their 
heyday, the band had three number one singles and reportedly earned a 
whopping £80 million, but the boys admitted they squandered it.

A representative for Blue told 
MailOnline: 'Blue World Touring No.1’s account is dormant and no longer 
in use. Therefore this is completely unreflective of Blue’s earnings.

'We
 can confirm that the debt that is shown in this account relates to an 
internal transfer between the parent company and Blueworld and not any 
third party.

'This sum has now been reconciled internally in the latest set of accounts and is no longer in existence.'

Last year, Simon declared himself bankrupt just a few weeks after his bandmate Duncan had.

Blue rose to fame in 2000, and went on to sell 3.3million albums and one million singles across the UK
