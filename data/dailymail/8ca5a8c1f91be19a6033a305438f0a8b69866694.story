A Wyoming landslide about the size of two football fields continues to slowly move down a hill, causing nearby residents to evacuate - and splitting apart one home.

48 Jackson residents as well as several businesses were evacuated, according to a CNN report. The residents checked in to a Red Cross station.

So far, only one unoccupied home has sustained any damage. The house is directly atop the slide zone and its interior wooden floor seems to be splitting in two, Assistant Town Manager Roxanne Robinson told the channel.

Landslide: the landslide continues to shift, officials say making it unsafe for Jackson residents to return home

Hope: a geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent

'What really struck me is the wood flooring, which is separating,' Robinson said. 'One half of the house looks like it's on side of the slide area and the other half is definitely at the crest of the slide.'

Robinson also said that the home's driveway is cracked by a 6-1o-12-inch upward fissure. 

According to CNN, the landslide moves slowly enough for officials to observe ground cracks and monitor its path each day.

Officials say the landslide continues to shift, making it unsafe for residents of mostly apartments to return home even though the apartments are outside the area where the highest risk of a collapse exists.

'The cracks continue to widen and deepen,' Robinson said on Saturday. 'If it keeps sliding every day, other complications could arise.'

Helping hand: the American Red Cross is set to open a shelter for displaced residents on Sunday night

Residents are allowed escorted access to their homes to check on them and pick up personal belongings, but no one is allowed to stay overnight, Robinson said.

About 43 people were escorted to their homes on Saturday as well as between 9am and 5pm on Sunday, according to a town press release.  Residents requesting escorted access on Monday will be able to do so by appointment only.

The Red Cross has provided 18 displaced residents with hotel rooms until now. But the continuing uncertainty of when they can return home has led the agency to open a shelter.

Evacuees were told that they can report to the Teton County Fair Grounds Exhibition Hall at 6pm on Sunday night, according to a town press release.

Displaced: no one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home

No one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home, Robinson said.

Robinson said portable water tanks were being placed on the unstable hill in case a fire breaks out. The shifting hill has broken permanent water lines, and the temporary water lines that have been put in place don't provide sufficient pressure for firefighting, she said.

There are power lines on the hill that could be brought down by the slide and spark a fire.

'It's definitely dry on the hill, and we need to have a water supply that we can access in a hurry should it be necessary,' said Mike Moyer, an official with the local incident command team.

At the foot of the slide zone, two restaurants, a liquor store and a just-built Walgreens remain closed amid a slim but persistent risk the hill could collapse suddenly.

A geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent.
