Guitarist and vocalist Joe Perry of the rock band Aerosmith may be an Icon to some. For Perry on the other hand, his cat Icon is his everything, a sentiment  he lovingly expresses in a letter to his favorite pussy of all time.

Perry expresses his undying love for Icon in the new book called, A letter to My Cat created by Lisa Erspamer. The page-turner is a collection of letters from celebrities to their purring pets.

'We love and have loved them all. But there was one animal we never had a chance to make part of our clan that always intrigued us: the Maine Coon cat,' writes Perry in his adorable letter, reports The DoDo.

Purrfect read: Joe Perry's love letter to his cat Icon is one of the letters in this book created by Lisa Erspamer

I love you Perry much: Joe Perry details his eternal love for his cat Icon in a heartwarming letter 

He goes on to describe how when Icon was a kitten he was larger than some cats are when they are full gown. Perry's cat has qualities which are larger than life, he says.

'Already at this young age you moved with a grace and majesty I had never seen before. Icon, you are in a class of your own,' Perry says dotingly.

In the letter, Perry explains he doesn't even mind being woken up by Icon after getting home late from a gig because his touch is always, 'gentle and loving.'

Perry once thought he was a dog person but after he met Icon he was completely won over.

'I have always been a dog person, but you won me over! Your beautiful coat, your instincts that seem to let you read our minds, the way you MUST sleep so that you’re in constant touch with Billie and me. There’s no denying that you’re there . . . you’re so BIG!' said Perry of the snuggle sessions with his cat and his wife Billie.

'You came with the name Icon' and it’s the name you still have now because you live up to every definition of the word! You are truly one of a kind and have a special place in the Perry clan’s heart of hearts. I love you and always will,' says Perry in a heart-warming finale.

The book can be purchased in select bookstores and on the website Alettertomycat.com.
