It was a case of Royal sibling rivalry today, as Princes William and Harry battled it out on the polo field at Beaufort Polo Club, Tetbury, Gloucestershire.

The two played on opposing sides for the June Goldin Group Charity Cup, which saw the younger brother reach victory with the Piaget team.

It was no doubt a sour loss for the Duke of Cambridge as he was beaten by Harry in the same match last year, as well.

His Royal Salute team were beaten by the Beaufort Polo Club, of which Harry played for, in 2013.

Piaget scored seven goals earlier today, while Royal Salute managed five and a half.

The royal battle commenced at 3pm today.

For
 as little as Â£10 per ticket, spectators were able not only enjoy the 
riveting games, but entertainment and over 40 exhibitors in the tented 
shopping village as well.
