From the look on her face, you’d think it was the first time this baby elephant had seen water. 

Wide-eyed and with a huge smile, she was pictured splashing about at Ragunan National Zoo in Jakarta with her twin. 

The youngster is named Lestari – Indonesian for ‘Preserve’ – a reference to the threat elephants still face from poachers.

Indonesian photographer Alrosa Fhari captured her joy upon a visit to the zoo, waiting patiently outside the elephant enclosure for six hours to get the best shot. 

'These elephants were playing together and washing themselves as they splashed about in the water,' the 25-year-old said.

'They were so cute to watch and happy, too. To me, that is really special..

'Capturing these images took a lot of patience. I had to wait hours to finally see the elephants playing in the pool.

'I felt pure bliss upon capturing these photographs, as it was a moment I have always wanted to see.' 

The poaching of elephants, for their ivory, meat and hides, continues to be a major threat to their existence.  

'I do feel a little sad to see these beautiful animals in confinement rather than in nature.

'However, they looked happy and very well looked after,' Mr Fahri added.
