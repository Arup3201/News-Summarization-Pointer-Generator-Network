A 13-year-old girl in Alabama was kidnapped, raped and sodomized for three days by at least five men, authorities said.

Police in Bessemer say the girl, who didn't know any of her abductors, was 'passed around' by the five men in a variety of locations between July 26 and 28 .

She eventually escaped on her own.

Detectives are now treating the investigation as a human trafficking case, AL.com reported.

Derion Shumpert (left) and Khalil Bradley (right) are two of the five people that police in Alabama say 'passed around' a 13-year-old girl while raping and sodomizing her for five days.

At least two of the men involved are juveniles, though they may yet be charged as adults.

The other three men are: Derion J. Shumpert, Khalil L. Bradley and Sammy Cooper Jr., all 19.

Shumpert is charged with second-degree rape and has been released on $25,000 bond.

Bradley faces one charge of second-degree sodomy.

Cooper is charged with first-degree sodomy and remains at Jefferson County Jail, unable to post a $500,000 bail.

Lt. Darron Hunter said police are investigating several other suspects, and more charges could be filed this week, WBMA-LD reported.
