Shocking: Cyril Harling, 89, was brutally mugged as he walked home in the town where he lived for the past 76 years

A Second World War veteran was  targeted by heartless muggers who pounced on him as he walked home.

Cyril Harling, 89, had just withdrawn his pension of £200 which was supposed to last him the month when he was robbed.

The Second World War veteran, who fought in the D-Day landings in Normandy was followed by a car after he got off the bus.

The two men trailed Mr Harling, who uses a walking frame, in a white car in Rainham, Essex.

One of them jumped out, overpowered him and demanded his keys.

They took the keys from Mr Harling's pocket, along with his pension money.

A local businessman and councillor, disgusted by the incident, has now posted a reward in a bid to catch the robbers.

Cyril said: 'I've lived in Rainham since 1936 and I've never known anything like this to happen.

'I would have been able to do something in my younger days ' defend myself.

'I had more weight back then.'

Ruthless: Cyril Harling, 89, had just withdrawn his pension of £200 which was supposed to last him the month when he was robbed

The devastated OAP, who worked at Ford's in Dagenham for 39 years after the war, added: 'I'm only speaking out because I don't want the same thing to happen to someone else.'

A former RAF serviceman, Mr Harling was a lorry driver in the D-Day landings in June 1944.

Praise: Outraged Cllr Jeff Tucker said: 'I've not met too many people that are like Cyril. 'The man is a hero and I think he's extremely brave for coming forward'

He also saw action in India and went to Japan after the Japanese surrendered in August 1945.

Outraged Cllr Jeff Tucker said: 'I've not met too many people that are like Cyril.

'The man is a hero and I think he's extremely brave for coming forward.

'He still gets out, he still likes a pint.

'In the old days he would have fought them off.'

The local jeweller added: 'Someone must know who robbed this elderly man.

'I'm offering a £200 reward for someone who comes forward with information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the people who did this.'

Cllr Tucker also pledged to give hard-up Mr Harling £200 to replace his mugged money.

A Met Police spokesman said they were studying CCTV in an attempt to nail the muggers.
