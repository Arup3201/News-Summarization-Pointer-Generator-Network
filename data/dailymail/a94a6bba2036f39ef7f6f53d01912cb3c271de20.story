Idea: Music fan Richard Davies created Twickets over frustration at high ticket prices and empty seats at 'sold out' events

It is a situation which many people have been faced with.

Tickets to that all important event you are desperate to see are sold out. The only option left is to pay way over face value through secondary websites or touts.

But that could all be about to change thanks to one of the UK's fastest growing businesses.

Music fan Richard Davies created Twickets after he saw a fan offering to give away tickets to a show for free on Twitter instead of letting them go to waste.

The London-based web designer believed that other people with tickets to events which they were unable to attend would rather sell them to real fans at face value or less instead of through expensive secondary ticket websites.

He went on to create @Twickets in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less.

The business has so far allowed people to sell on 45,000 'spare' tickets to events.

It follows anger rising in recent years over the cost of tickets through secondary websites such as Viagogo and Seatwave which mark up the price of tickets immediately after sale at the box office.

This has allowed Twickets to surge in popularity.

Mr Davies, 45, said: 
'First and foremost it was set up to reduce empty seats at events which 
were supposedly sold out.

'I thought one of the reasons for 
that was because people cannot exchange tickets at the last minute if 
they have a change of plans.

'The
other important thing is to ensure that fans are not being ripped off by overpriced tickets going spare by the expensive secondary ticket 
sites.

'It has been phenomenal and everybody has been very supportive and positive.'

This morning, tickets being offered for 
sale included Southampton v QPR for a face value price of £35 and two 
spare tickets for a Justin Bieber concert tonight at the Nottingham Arena
for £50 each.

Success: Twickets was created in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less

Bargain: Two spare tickets for a Justin Bieber concert this evening at the Nottingham Arena for being offered for £50 each this morning

Girls Aloud tickets at the O2 Arena 
which cost £110 on Viagogo cost just £42 on Twickets. While two tickets
to see The Book of Mormon at the Prince of Wales Theatre cost £110 on Twickets compared to £293.15 on Viagogo.

Last week a Twickets iPhone app went on sale and topped the iTunes new app chart with 30,000 downloads.

Its Twitter page has almost 14,000 followers with fans constantly tweeting ticket offers.

Speaking to The Independent, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is campaigning to prevent ticket touts said: 'Fans are being squeezed out of gigs and shows thanks to unscrupulous touts exploiting the talent of others.

'Twickets is what the secondary market should be about: true fans selling to true fans at face value.'
