Liverpool have been handed a tough third-round trip to League Two outfit AFC Wimbledon in a re-run of the 1988 FA Cup final.

The Crazy Gang caused an upset 26 years ago and Neal Ardley's men will be hoping to do the same again at Kingsmeadow this time around.

Holders Arsenal take on Hull City in a replay of this year's final, while Blyth Spartans - the lowest-ranked team remaining in the competition - host Championship side Birmingham City.

The last time Manchester United played Accrington Stanley was in 1945-46  over two legs.

United thrashed Yeovil 8-0 in the Cup in 1949. 

Premier League leaders Chelsea take on Watford, while 2011 winners Manchester City host Sheffield Wednesday. Manchester United face the victors of the replay between Accrington and Yeovil.

There are eight non-League sides in the hat, with the pick of the ties involving those teams seeing Dover Athletic drawn with at home to Premier League Crystal Palace.

Stoke, managed by Welshman Mark Hughes, play Wrexham in another match which pits the game's elite against a side whose memorable giant-killing act was a defeat of Arsenal, in 1992, while West Brom host Gateshead. 

Other stand-out ties see Sunderland face Leeds in a repeat of their 1973 showdown, while Tottenham take on Burnley, a replay of their 1962 final.
