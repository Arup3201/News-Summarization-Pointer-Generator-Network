A hairy animal lover has put his facial hair to good use by raising an orphaned chick by keeping her warm under his beard.

Brian Doss, 33, came to the rescue of Peeps the Duck after hatching at his home in Athens, Ohio.

He was stunned to see her survive after he bought a handful of chicken eggs from a farm to try and raise - unfortunately none of the eggs hatched.

But burly-beaked Peeps survived, and immediately latched onto her adopted parent - who gave her round-the-clock care

But Peeps survived, and immediately latched onto her adopted mum Brian - who gave her round-the-clock care.

He even dedicated his shoulder and hearty beard to keep her warm - where she would regularly fall asleep as he watched TV.

Now almost ten weeks on, Peeps has grown too big to fit under his chin but is still very fond of him.

'She's a cool duck, she's interesting. She talks to me all the time and sticks her head out of the cage and goes 'peep peep peep' he said

Peeps now sleeps in a bed next to Mr Doss' and spends her days swimming in her own bath tub

Mr Doss, a former animal carer, said: 'I tried to hatch out some chicken eggs and I had a duck egg in there by accident - I didn't managed the humidity levels properly unfortunately.

'But Peeps is made of strong stuff so I ended up with a single duckling and having a background in animal rescue I've seen single ducklings literally die of loneliness.

'I spent a couple weeks just every day just 24 hours with her - feeding her, watering her and letting her keep warm under my beard.

'Like any first parent, it took a while to figure it out. She's a cool duck, she's interesting. She talks to me all the time and sticks her head out of the cage and goes 'peep peep peep'.'

Mr Doss kept an online blog of her journey, which has since become an internet hit.

He has since attempted to train her as his pet - but she only has her eye on one thing.

Mr Doss added: 'She loves food. That's all she goes for. It's really started to calm her until she can become an outside duck.

'Then she'll get to run around the yard and eat bugs and all kinds of yummy stuff and help cut down on my spider population a little bit.'
