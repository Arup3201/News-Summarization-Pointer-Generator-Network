Teachers’ unions prompted uproar last night by suggesting schools should be closed because of the heatwave.

They insisted there should be a maximum legal temperature of 26C (79F) at which teachers should be expected to work – a limit which would have meant children being sent home across most of the country for the last fortnight.

Many schools are due to break up for the summer holidays within the next week, but union bosses claimed staff are struggling with ‘hot and stuffy’ classrooms.

The teachers' union said that they could not work in high temperatures as it would reduce concentration

General secretary of the National Union of Teachers Christine Blower said: ‘Clearly, very high temperatures can affect the ability of teachers and pupils to concentrate and to work effectively, and can cause physical discomfort and illness.

‘The NUT will continue to campaign to ensure that 26C is the absolute maximum temperature in which teachers should be expected to work.’ 

Christine Blower said that high temperatures affect the ability of teachers to work and concentrate

Chris Keates, of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said: ‘Our research revealed teachers and pupils sweltering in classrooms with inadequate ventilation with not even blinds at the windows which could be used to provide some limited shade.

‘The impact of excessive temperatures on teaching and learning needs to be given serious consideration.

'Lessons are disrupted by constant requests for time out to get drinks of water or to go outside, and many tasks take far longer to perform.’

Their remarks were condemned by Conservatives, who said parents would be hugely inconvenienced by school closures.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It seems to  me all the unions do is try to find an excuse for teachers not to be at work. For goodness’ sake, everyone else has to work when  it’s hot.’ 

Guidance from Public Health England says schools could consider starting or finishing lessons early to combat the heat.
