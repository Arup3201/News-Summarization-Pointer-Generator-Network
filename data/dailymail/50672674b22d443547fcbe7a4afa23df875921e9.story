The search for the missing wife of a relative of Lord Baden-Powell - the founder of the Scout movement - has ended after her body was found washed up on the banks of a river.

Allison Baden-Clay went missing from her home in Australia 12 days ago.

Her husband, Gerard Baden-Clay - a great grandson of Lord Baden-Powell - told police that she had not returned from a late-night walk.

Grim discovery: The body of Mrs Baden-Clay was found by a canoeist paddling along an isolated stretch of Kholo Creek in the Mount Crosby district of Brisbane. Members of a search-team are pictured

The body of Mrs Baden-Clay was found by a canoeist on an isolated stretch of Kholo Creek in the Mount Crosby district of Brisbane, which is eight miles from the Baden-Clay home.

Police said they were treating the death of the 43-year-old mother-of-three, who spoke 
six languages and was a popular sportswoman, as murder.

An intensive hunt for clues is continuing today in thick bushland lining the creek. The rugged bushland is popular with hikers and Scouts.

Mr Baden-Clay was spoken to by police numerous times during the search for his wife, but officers declined to comment today on whether they had ruled him out as a suspect.

Superintendent Mark Ainsworth said 'numerous' people of interest had been interviewed.

Brisbane's Courier Mail newspaper said it understood that the search for clues would take police to a Scout camp upstream from where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found.

The paper added that it was believed the killer could have taken Mrs Baden-Clay's body to the area where her body was found as early as 8pm on April 19 - the night she went missing.

Superintendent Ainsworth said that after the discovery of the body, which was dressed in clothing similar to that worn by Mrs Baden-Clay when she went missing, her family were notified that the woman was probably her.

He said her parents, Geoff and Priscilla Dickie, were still coming to terms with the news.

'They've been here,' he said, referring to the area where the body was found. He said they were 'ever hopeful that there will be a positive resolution, the same as ourselves.

'They're devastated. I can't explain it any other way.'

Mr Gerard Baden-Clay - who refers to his relationship with Lord Baden-Powell on his real estate agent's website - was surrounded by family and friends at his parents' home, where he has been staying.

His parents have lowered the Australian flag at the front of their house to half mast and a neighbour has done the same.

On his website, Mr Baden-Clay writes: 'My great-grandfather once said that "there are two ways to climbing a mountain: one man goes steadily upward, following the track that has been made by othersâ€¦the other climber is equally anxious to reach the top, but he looks wider, he looks ahead and higher."

'For me, as a businessman, having that wider focus and ambition to do things better has been my inspiration.'

Superintendent Ainsworth said the creek where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found had not been searched previously because police had been following a search and rescue manual which involved a thorough search of a one and a half mile radius around the Baden-Clay home.

'The missing person's case has been ramped up for some time,' he said.

'At this stage, we are looking at an unlawful homicide investigation.We believe it reached that level some time ago.'
