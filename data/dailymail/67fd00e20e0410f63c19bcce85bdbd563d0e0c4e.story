Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart has revealed that her latest must-have accessory is a drone and now she simply can't stop extolling the virtues of flying robots

Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart has revealed that her latest must-have accessory is a drone and now she simply can’t stop extolling the virtues of flying robots.

The millionaire businesswoman received a drone fitted with a high-definition camera for her 72nd birthday last August and says she was hooked instantly. 

After downloading the appropriate app onto her iPad, she took her $300 Parrot AR Drone 2.0 to the beach in Maine to try it out.

‘In just a few minutes I was hooked,’ she writes in an opinion piece featured in Time magazine on Tuesday.

‘In
 near silence, the drone rose, hovered, and dove, silently and 
surreptitiously photographing us and the landscape around us. The photos
 and video were stunning.’

Not
 content with taking ‘arresting’ photos and videos herself, Martha also 
got one of her farm workers to use his drone to capture images of her 
153-acre farm in Bedford, New York.

‘Suddenly we could see with astonishing clarity the layout of the open fields, the horse paddocks, the chicken coops, the greenhouses, the hay barn, the cutting gardens and henhouses, the clematis pergola, and the long allée of boxwood,’ she writes.

Martha Stewart said this aerial shot of her vegetable garden looked 'very much like my Peter Rabbit marzipan embellished Easter cake'

'A beautiful morning shot of my home in the background, the horse stable on the left,' wrote Martha. 'I am so happy and amazed that the aerial shots show such nice structure and orderliness - a well designed landscape!'

Not content with posting the photos on 
her website, Martha has been droning on about the airborne device to 
anyone willing to listen.

‘Imagine what Louis XIV could have accomplished at Versailles if he'd had one,’ she enthused in Time.

When Vanity Fair asked if her neighbors had called the authorities to report seeing a U.F.O., she laughingly replied: ‘No. I don’t have any neighbors.’

In a satirical essay in The New Yorker, Martha lays claim to being a pioneer for the good that drones can do, plus she says she ‘doesn’t do ladders’ to take photographs.

Martha has since claimed that the New Yorker ‘missed the point about why I love my drone.’

'Drones
 can be useful tools, and I am all about useful tools. One of my mottos 
is "the right tool for the right job,"' she writes.

'I love the intersection of the four big horse paddocks and the way the fencing makes everything so architecturally pleasing,' writes Martha
