Most airlines begin life as major government-owned projects or as the ambitious playthings of billionaires with endless piles of cash to spare.

Not as start-ups funded via a whip-round on the internet. 

But such is the curious situation with a
 new high-end carrier which intends to come to life via the decidedly 
modern money-raising method of ‘crowd-funding’.

Taking off: Odyssey Airlines plans to operate business-class flights from London City airport

A London-based entrepreneur has announced plans for Odyssey Airlines – a business-class only operation which will fly between the British capital and New York from 2016 – assuming that the $8.5million (£5million) needed can be sourced from small investors.

‘Crowd-funding’ has developed as a concept in the last two or three years.

Close to the action: Flying from London City will help the airline cater to business class passengers

Usually, it sees funds to support a medium-sized idea – a rock band without a record label trying to record an album; a fledgling film-maker trying to produce a documentary – raised from a large number of small backers rather than a single financial giant.

‘Crowd-funding’ also tends to occur via an internet petition, with social media used to spread the word to possible interested parties.

It has not yet been used to help the development of something as sizeable as an airline.

But Adam Scott, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and the CEO of Odyssey Airlines, is confident that the money to make his dream reality can be found via this method.

‘By using an online crowd funding platform, we are offering an investment that is accessible to a large and diverse number of potential investors,’ he says.

Prior example: Silverjet operated as a business-class-only airline between 2006 and 2008

Scott is using the crowd-funding website Crowdcube (crowdcube.com) as his chosen portal.

The project has already raised funds from other sources, and hopes to be in business within two years, offering a premium transatlantic service.

Mooted flight routes include New York and Toronto, with all services taking off from London City airport, close to the Docklands business hub in the east of the capital.

Odyssey will reportedly use Bombardier C-series aircraft, with 40 fully-reclining flat-bed seats to cater to passengers travelling for business purposes.

However, Odyssey will not be the first airline to aim solely at the suit-and-tie market.

Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) recently announced business-only flights between Stavanger, on Norway’s west coast, and Houston in Texas – a service designed to appeal to executives needing to zip between these two oil-industry hotspots.

And in February, Qatar Airways announced an exclusively business-class service between Doha and London Heathrow. Flights are due to begin on 15 May.

Luxury in the skies: Despite catering solely to business-class flyers, Silverjet ceased to trade in 2008

While investors will hope to see a profit on their money if they assist in the crowd-funding of Odyssey Airlines, they should perhaps also be wary of a recent precedent.

Silverjet was a business-class-only airline, which flew out of London Luton, and served New York-Newark and Dubai between 2006 and 2008.

Despite a positive start, the airline ran into economic turbulence as the financial crisis of 2008 took hold, and ceased trading after a mooted buy-out failed to come to pass.
