When it comes to Jane Austen classics, most would assume any narrator of one of the novels to have a strong British accent and a somewhat regal sense about them.

This however was not the case when Australian comedian Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes decided to present his own version of Pride and Prejudice on a packed train in the middle of peak-hour.

On Tuesday morning the 43-year-old - while positioned right in the centre of a crowded Sydney train carriage - opened up the Austen classic and began to read the 19th century novel aloud in his thick Australian accent.

Aussie comic Dave Hughes brightened the morning of many commuters on Tuesday when he began reading a Jane Austen novel aloud on the train

Footage shows the comedian holding the book up while standing in between others passengers, before - to the surprise of his fellow commuters - he breaks out into narration.

'She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him,' Hughes began, earning a few strange looks from others travelling on the City Circle loop that morning.

One man standing behind the comedian stifles a smile and looks around as though he's unsure whether what he's seeing is a joke or not.

Passengers weren't sure how to react to the stunt, and many such as the man in white (far right) stifled laughs

As Hughes continues he gets few smiles and nods from fellow passengers as he looks around the carriage.

He then treats those listening to a turning point in the novel, where Mr Darcy at long last admits his love to Elizabeth Bennett. 

'In vain have I struggled, it will not do. My feelings will not be repressed,' he read.

'You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you,' Hughes continued playing the part of Mr Darcy.

Train passengers clapped and cheered for the comedian's performance before they got off the train

While some Sydneysiders took out their smartphones to capture the scene unfolding, others listened intently as The Project host continued to speak.

As the train pulled up to Town Hall station commuters laughed as Hughes concluded his passage, while some cheered and others clapped as the train doors opened.

'I never took you as a Jane Austen fan,' one commuter quipped as he disembarked the train.

The stunt appears to have been part of Audible.com's Australian launch, providing those Down Under with a series of audiobooks read by Aussie celebs and available for free. 

Hughes is known for his stand-up comedy but is also a regular host on Channel Ten's The Project
