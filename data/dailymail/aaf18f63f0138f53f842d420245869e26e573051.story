Prisoners are smoking e-cigarettes as part of a move which could lead to a ban on smoking in jails.

E-cigarettes are now being sold in three prisons across the UK as part of a pilot to test whether the alternative could be used instead of cigarettes, BBC news reported.

Last year, the prison service said it was committed to banning cigarettes across jails in England and Wales.

An e-cigarette brand is available in shops in women’s prison Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire, as well as men’s prisons Preston Prison in Lancashire and Stocken in Rutland.

It was reported that 50 were sold across both male prisons in one week. The move comes after a Guernsey prison banned tobacco last year.

The anti-cigarette policy was introduced at Les Nicolles prison following success on the Isle of Man.

At Les Nicolles, prisoners now use e-cigarettes instead of traditional tobacco products.

Guernsey Prison governor Dave Matthews said last year that the smoking ban at the jail had ‘gone very well’.

He said: ‘We have removed tobacco but also provided prisoners with some assistance to try and give up their nicotine habit through the form of patches and the use of Quitline.’

Prisons across Britain currently allow inmates to smoke in their cells but not in communal parts of the jail or in exercise yards.

Of the total prison population, a staggering 80 per cent of inmates smoke.

The Prison Officers’ Association has been campaigning for a ban on smoking in all UK prisons since 2007.

The POA said they were concerned that staff would be ‘forced to suffer the harmful effects of second-hand smoke’.

E-cigarettes have soared in popularity in the UK but any long-term impact on health remains unknown.

Critics of the devices fear using them in public could ‘re-normalise’ smoking.

An independent review recently found that almost one in 10 smokers had been able to quit thanks to cigarette replacements.

A Prison Service spokesman told the BBC: ‘We are looking into whether disposable e-cigarettes are suitable for use in prisons and are currently conducting a trial in three prisons.’

A spokesman for the Prison Governors Association said ‘anything that could protect not only staff but other prisoners and visitors from second-hand smoke inhalation is obviously welcomed.

‘We will be watching this trial with interest to see just how successful it is.’
