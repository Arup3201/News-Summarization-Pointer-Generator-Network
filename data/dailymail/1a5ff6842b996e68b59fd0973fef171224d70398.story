Former Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison's plans to turn his Hawaiian island paradise into a major eco-tourism destination have been delayed.  

The billionaire software guru spent $300 million buying a 97 per cent stake in the island of Lanai in 2012 which has a population of 3,200 people. 

Under ambitious plans announced soon after the purchase, Ellison announced that he wanted to develop a third resort hotel on the island as well as building  a new desalination plant to provide fresh water. He also wanted to expand the island's airport, allowing direct flights from the United States.

Ellison is planning to turn the island into a major eco-tourism destination with additional holiday resorts 

He also had plans for developing renewable energy and sustainable agriculture on the island. 

According to the New York Times within four months of Ellison's purchase, unemployment on the island had dropped to just 1.2 per cent. 

In the past, the island was owned by the company behind Dole pineapples and was one of the world's largest producers of the fruit, until the market changed making the plantations unsustainable. 

Initially, local residents were overwhelmingly supportive of the new plans, after Ellison bought 87,000 of the island's 90,000 acres, but that optimism soon turned to disillusionment.   

One anonymous young man told the New York Times: ' There’s a lot of complainers — some people aren’t happy — but they don’t realize how much they have. It’s just awesome!' 

However, the mini boom caused by the takeover has led to a shortage of housing and some residents have concerns about the future of the island.

Lanai native Zane de la Cruz complained that communication under the Ellison regime is actually worse than it had been previously. 

He said: 'They give out a lot worthless information. They give you buzzwords.'

Retired schoolteacher Pierce Myers added: 'The hope is real. The potential is fantastic. This place was developed on the backs of humble people; people who cared for each other. When you live on an island, you can’t afford to make enemies. A compassion grows from that. Now it feels like everything’s being driven from outside by some force that is not part of that tradition.'

However, local residents have noticed that some of the planned redevelopments or improvements have not been made or have stalled. 

A golf course overlooking Lanai City has been allowed to get overgrown and fish in the ornamental ponds have been allowed to die. 

According to locals that development has been delayed until 2015 or possibly 2016. 

Also construction of the planned desalination plant was halted on September 12. The plant is needed to allow further construction on the island as there is a shortage of fresh drinking water.    

Resident Gail Allen told the New York TImes: 'I don’t think Mr. Ellison’s trying to hurt people, but I don’t think he realizes what a delicate little ecosystem the economy is here.' 

School teacher Karen de Brum said: 'At the end of the day, Mr Ellison can and will do what he wants. He asks for input, but that’s like me asking for input on what to do with my backyard. I own my backyard.' 

Over the past two years retired French Canadian hypnotherapist Henry Jolicoeur has followed the story of Lanai and travelled out to the tropical island to interview the residents about their view of the takeover. 

In the past, Lanai was one of the largest exporters of pineapples until the trade collapsed in the 1990s

Mr Jolicoeur interviewed residents in Lanai City about the man who now owned a third of all their houses and apartments.  

Mr Jolicoeur spent three weeks interviewing residents shortly after news of Mr Ellison's purchase became public. 

As well as hotel resorts, the former Oracle CEO now owned the island's graveyard, Only a gas station, car rental company, two banks, a credit union and a coffee shop are not owned by the billionaire. 

One fishing boat captain told Mr Jolicoeur: 'I want to thank Mr. Ellison. He’s got a vision, and he’s taking care of us over here on Lanai.'

Others wanted to thank the businessman for bringing plenty of work to the island and providng them with a future.

Even the local Catholic church is supportive of the new investor. One priest said: 'Heavenly father... We ask for your blessings for Mr Ellison, particularly, and those who work with him, that all the good plans and intentions that he has for Lanai be fruitful.'

In a public meeting in 2013 to discuss the billionaire's plan for the island, a spokesman told residents that Ellison was planning 'the first economically viable, 100 per cent green community'. 

He wanted renewable energy and electric cars. 

When the island was put up for sale in 2011, its residents were concerned that it might be bought by a Russian oligarch or a middle eastern sheikh.
