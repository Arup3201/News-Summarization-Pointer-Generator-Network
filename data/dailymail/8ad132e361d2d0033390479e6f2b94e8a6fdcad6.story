A two volume set of Mein Kampf, signed by Adolf Hitler and dedicated with a personal message to one of the first members of the Nazi party, has sold for triple what it was estimated to sell.

The manifesto of the future Fuhrer sold after 11 bids for $64,850 (£38,753), including a buyers' premium, at an action house in Los Angeles, after expecting to sell for between $20,000 and $25,000.

Both volumes are signed by Hitler and dedicated to Josef Bauer, the 34th member of the Nazi Party and one of the leaders of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, the attempted Hitler-led coup of the Bavarian government.

The copy of Mein Kampf is a true original, and came in two volumes, dated 1925 and 1926, when the volumes were written and published a year after one another. Pictured right, the written inscription by Hitler to his friend, who later became a member of the SS

It is thought that the two volume set was given to Bauer as a Christmas gift between 1925 and 1926, when each volume was written and published.

Hitler wrote 'Mein Kampf' while in prison, and in it he outlines his political 
doctrine for Germany and blamed the country’s economic troubles after the First World War on the Jews,
 Marxists, Social Democrats and the Weimar Republic leadership.

The book is incredibly well preserved, which is likely why it sold for so much money at the auction in Los Angeles

Adolf Hitler (1889-1945)- signed volumes of his book 'Mein Kampf' were sold by the LA auction house, advertised as 'an ominously signed set of books that futilely warned the world of Hitler's intentions' adding they were more scarce for being signed to a fellow Nazi leader

The book was advertised as 'an ominous detailing of Hitler's Nazi manifesto and his plan for Germany'

In addition to the sale of the signed copy of Mein Kampf, the auction also sold the jacket of a prominent Nazi figure, Albert Speer.

Speer was the Nazi party's chief architect, who later in his career took political office as the Minister of Armaments and War Production, and was one of Hitler's inner circle.

In addition, the auction sold a leather jacket owned by the Nazi architect and Minister for Armaments Albert Speer

The leather jacket sold for $10,068 (£6,030) and was possibly worn by Speer when he visited Hitler for the last time on April 23 1945.

Inside the jacket are labels that bear Speer's name, the brand name W. Fliegner and the initials of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the German regulatory office for quality control in manufacturing.

The RZM label depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite, and also included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed 
on it, found stored in the coat’s pocket.

The coat made its way to the U.S. when it was taken by an Allied soldier named 'Ralph', who mentioned the coat in a letter to his mother about his time in the war, dated May 6 1945.

The letter mentions that he 'looked around today in a huge chalet of a high-ranking Nazi. For you I have a gold necklace. And for Dad, I have a great leather jacket...I took a coat with no Nazi symbols on the outside...Unfortunately, the name of Nazi Albert Speer is stamped in the jacket...'

World War II photos and films document Speer wearing the same (or similar) coat, and a written record also exists of his last meeting with Hitler that describes Speer as wearing a suit and leather coat, possibly this same garment.

After World War II, Speer was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials and imprisoned until 1966. He died in 1983.
