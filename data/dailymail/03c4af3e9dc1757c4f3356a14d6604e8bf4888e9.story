A mother has spoken of her fury after doctors sent her son home 11 
times in five months before discovering a football-sized tumour in his stomach.

Sharon Woolley was told her five-year-old son Charlie was 
suffering from constipation - when all along he 
had neuroblastoma, a rare and aggressive cancer with one of the lowest 
survival rates.

Miss Woolley believes the time delay in 
diagnosis may now affect whether he survives the disease or not. He has 
been given a survival rate of less than 40 per cent.

Delay: Sharon Woolley claims she was sent home by doctors ELEVEN times in five months before her son Charlie was finally diagnosed with an aggressive form of childhood cancer

Happier times: Charlie, before he fell ill. The delay in diagnosing his cancer means his chance of survival is now less than 40 per cent

Charlie had been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism - which doctors said could cause consitpation

Miss Woolley, who lives in Lytham St 
Annes, said: ‘If we hadn’t been fobbed off so much for so long, and 
Charlie had been diagnosed earlier, maybe he would have much better odds
today.

'I’m just 
hoping that he can been strong enough to fight this terrible disease. I 
am so angry that he was sent home by doctors eleven times before it was 
diagnosed.

‘It was only because I was so convinced that something was terribly wrong that I kept going back to the doctors repeatedly.

‘When he was finally diagnosed with cancer I was so angry that it hadn’t been spotted before.’

Charlie
first started complaining of stomach ache in January last year. He was 
also refusing to eat and appeared pale. Miss Woolley, who is separated 
from Charlie’s father, took him to the GP.

The doctor told Miss Woolley that it 
was probably just constipation, but the problems worsened over the next 
few weeks and his stomach started to swell. 

She
took him back to the doctors twice more. Both times she was referred to
Blackpool Victoria Hospital,here doctors gave him laxatives and sent 
him home.

Miss Woolley said: ‘I was so worried about Charlie. He had severe stomach ache constantly and his stomach was swelling.

‘He
was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome - a form of autism - at the age 
of three, and they said that constipation can be a problem for autistic 
children.

‘I told 
the doctors I wasn’t happy with the diagnosis of constipation and I 
begged them to scan him, but they wouldn’t, as they told me that stomach
ache was very common.’

In March, she took him back to the GP for his sixth visit, who gave him a different type of laxative to try.

Then in April, she was forced to take
him to both the GP and then the out-of-hours surgery at the hospital as
it was during a weekend and she was so worried.

She
said: ‘By now I was almost demented with worry. He was losing weight, 
his spine was protruding, and his stomach was even more swollen.

‘By
May, when I took him for his ninth appointment, he looked nine months 
pregnant. He had stopped going to school as he was in so much pain. He 
couldn’t walk properly as he couldn’t stand straight, instead he wanted 
to crawl everywhere.

Battling: Charlie was only diagnosed with neuroblastoma after he was seen by doctors for the 11th time - and his mother insisted on a scan

‘I didn’t know what to do - I was at 
the end of my tether. I had gone to the GP’s, the out of hours surgery 
and the hospital nearly a dozen times, but no-one would listen to me. I 
felt like I’d been failed on every account.

‘In desperation I even rang his paediatrician whom he is under for Asperger’s Syndrome, but even she couldn’t help.'

On her 11th visit to the GP, she was once again referred to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

This time, as she sat in A&E, she told the nurse that she wasn’t leaving the hospital until Charlie had been given a scan.

She
said: ‘I sat in the hospital with Charlie in my arms and I was so angry
I shouted at the nurses that I wasn’t going anywhere.

‘I
didn’t care who was watching me, I had to get someone to listen to me. I
could see my boy was dying and no-one was doing anything about it.’

The hospital agreed to do a CT scan and when they saw the results the doctors immediately carried out more scans and biopsies.

‘The
sonographer asked the nurse if Charlie was an in-patient, and told her 
that if he wasn’t, he needed to be admitted fast. He had seen something 
on the scan but I didn’t know what it was.’

Fight: Charlie's mother said that even before he was diagnosed, he was unable to stand because of the pain

Charlie
was then referred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital where 
Miss Woolley was told that he had neuroblastoma, an aggressive childhood
cancer.

‘I was devastated, but I’d known that
something was badly wrong with my boy. The doctors told me the tumour 
in his stomach was the size of a basketball and it was so big that they 
couldn’t even see his lungs or liver on the scan.’

A
stage two or three tumour has a survival rate of 80-95 percent, but 
Charlie had a stage four tumour, where the survival rate drops to less 
than 40 per cent.

Miss
Woolley said: ‘I was so angry I couldn’t even think straight. All this 
time when I’d been fighting for someone to take me seriously, cancer was
ravaging my son.’

Charlie 
is currently undergoing chemotherapy and he also needs an operation to 
remove the tumour. Miss Woolley is also raising funds to take him to 
America for treatment, at a cost of £250,000.

Miss Woolley added: ‘The doctors and nurses at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital have been fantastic, and I’m hoping that Charlie will pull through.

‘But I’m so angry with the previous doctors, that I was sent home 11 times. I can only hope that my son survives after all this.’

Alison Moy, Chief Executive for the Neuroblastoma Alliance, said: ‘It can be a difficult cancer to diagnose, but it is a nasty and phenomenally aggressive cancer, so a few months delay in diagnosis can make such a difference as a neuroblastoma tumour can grow from two to 12 centimetres in a fortnight.’

Dr Mark O’Donnell, Medical Director at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The Trust is deeply sorry to hear about this family’s distress, it’s always very upsetting when a family member is seriously ill, particularly so when it’s a child. 

‘We are unable to discuss details of individual cases due to patient confidentiality. Whilst I’m not aware of the family raising any complaint with the Trust, I will be writing to them to arrange a meeting in person so that they can discuss their concerns in detail with us.’
