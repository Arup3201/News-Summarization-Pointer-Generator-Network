Martin Kaymer has vowed to follow in Rory McIlroy’s footsteps and use a bitter experience as added motivation after suffering the worst collapse in golf history at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.

Nine days on from that stunning loss, when he threw away a ten shot lead with 13 holes to play, the German admits he has been doing plenty of soul-searching. ‘It wasn’t just a big golf lesson it was a huge life lesson,’ he said. ‘It was like what happened to Rory a few years ago at the Masters. When he lost that back nine lead (in 2011) it was shocking and sad to see and it’s tough to handle those situations. 

'But if you deal with it honestly and gain more motivation then you can do what he did and come out a few months later and win the US Open by 20 shots or whatever.

Kaymer admitted that he was doing so well he became complacent and capitulated

‘I’ve been having some hard conversations with my dad and my brother in private and I do believe what happened will help me improve in the future. So I am very glad I went through it. If I had won in Abu Dhabi again (for a fourth time) everybody would have joked: "Oh yeah, why don’t they rename the place the Martin Kaymer golf course and all those sort of things.”

‘And yeah it would have been good to gain a few more world ranking points and another beautiful trophy in my house. But what happened instead – that will be better for me.’

US Open champion Kaymer was in good spirits here on Tuesday as he looked forward to the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday, where a star-studded field also includes the likes of the world numbers one and two, McIlroy and Henrik Stenson, plus Sergio Garcia and Graeme McDowell.

But the German star said he hopes to use the experience as motivation for future performances

Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy experienced something similar at the Masters in 2011

‘I think Abu Dhabi just shows you that German engineering doesn’t always work,’ he said, smiling. ‘It does usually, but one in a while it comes unstuck.’

Kaymer admitted that over-confidence played its part in his downfall. ‘I think when you start off a final round with a big lead and then you begin birdie, birdie, par, birdie, you almost feel like not much can go wrong,’ he said. ‘And in golf, that little bit of too much confidence can hurt and it’s a very fine line.

‘How I felt that day is not the person I am and not the person I want to be. It did not feel natural to me and it becomes very difficult because it is an unknown situation, and one you don’t want to be in.

‘Afterwards I asked myself how did I get into it and why did I get into it. And all those answers I got, they will prove important to me going forward.’

McIlroy was leading until the final round, he has experienced considerable success in the years after
