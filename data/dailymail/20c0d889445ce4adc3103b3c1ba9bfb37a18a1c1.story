An elderly widow who had fallen behind in her property taxes discovered she longer owned her home after trying to sell it to pay off her debt.

Unbeknown to Hertha Handler, ownership of her $1.2 million Oyster Bay Cove home in Long Island has been transferred to an investor who bought two of the liens against the property.

The 73-year-old widow had lived in the property for more than 40 years but after her husband died several years ago, she slipped behind on taxes and had an outstanding debt of $200,000.

Shocked: Hertha Handler knew she was behind on taxes but had no idea she no longer owned her house

Multiple liens had been made against the property, where Mrs Handler had raised her two sons, but she had no idea ownership had been transferred to investor Albert Kalimian. 

By buying just two of the liens from 
Oyster Bay Cove village for about $3,000 each, Mr Kalimian was able to 
take possession of the property.

Obtaining a property through liens differs from state to state, but in most cases an investor bids on liens and then waits to see if the owner will pay off the debt.

Tax collectors wait for a set amount of time, governed by each state, before putting the unpaid property taxes up for auction.

The winning bidder then has two ways to make money from their purchase.

If the property owner pays the taxes in the given time, the investor gets their money back, plus interest.

If the debt remains unpaid the investor can file a lawsuit seeking ownership of the property.

'For him to be able to come in and take 
the house that my parents had paid off and lived for 40 years for a few 
thousand dollars, that shouldn't happen,' Mrs Handlerâ€™s son, 
Christopher, told NBC New York.

An attorney for the family agreed, and said more effort should have been made to alert Mrs Handler to the legal issues she was facing.

'There should have been a further effort
 to make sure that Hertha Handler was being advised that she was in 
serious jeopardy of losing title to her house,' Elias 
Schwartz said.

The widow said although she knew she falling behind on her taxes, she didn't confide in her family because she didn't want to trouble them. 

'I have a difficult time asking for help,' she said.

Attorneys
 for Mrs Handler and Mr Kalimian are now trying to work out a deal, to 
ensure the widow can retain ownership of her family home.

Memories: Hertha Handler raised her two sons in this Oyster Bay Cove home, where she has lived for 40 years

Deal: Ownership of the house was transferred to investor Albert Kalimian when he bought two of the liens

Mr Kalimian had acted legally when he bought the liens, and the village attorney approved the property transfer, his attorney Alan Davis told NBC New York.

He added that when his client took on the property he didn't know the woman who lived there was an elderly widow.

An expert in property law said cases such as Mrs Handler's are relatively common, and that there are few restrictions on selling on liens. 

'I would imagine 30 to 40 percent of the
 municipalities make it easy to collect on tax liens because they want 
to sell the liens, they don't want to hold them. It takes a long time 
and manpower they don't have,' Ed Klein, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases, said.

The Oyster Bay Cove mayor and the attorney who approved the property transfer have not yet commented.
