Luis Suarez will take another step towards winning the race to be fit to face England at the World Cup on Monday when he trains with team-mates.

The Liverpool striker is not expected to take part in the full session but for the first time since going under the knife for surgery on the meniscus cartilage he will run out with team-mates at Uruguay’s Montevideo training camp.

The 31-goal Golden Boot was operated on 11 days ago and has been doing intensive physiotherapy at home ever since. He gave Uruguay’s football-crazy 3 million population a major boost on Friday when he strolled into the national team’s World Cup training base to have lunch with his team-mates.

Melee: Journalists, photographers and fans scrambled around Suarez as he left hospital after his operation

He then went
home to watch their 1-0 win over Northern Ireland in the Centenario 
Stadium where they face Slovenia in their final friendly on Wednesday.

Uruguay
 coach Oscar Tabarez is adamant that he will not rush back the country’s
 best player. After the narrow victory over Northern Ireland he said: 
'Luis will join up with the rest of the squad this week and depending on
 how his knee responds we will see how soon we can count on him to start
 a match.'

Uruguay
 are expected to not start with Suarez in their first game against Costa
 Rica but then welcome him back for their second match against England. 
Tabarez remains tight-lipped about who will play in his place in the 
first game.

He
 said: 'People are saying "[Diego] Forlan will replace Suarez" but 
nothing is decided. We will not decide the eleven to face Costa Rica 
until the day before the game.'
