Just like the Channing Tatum movie 21 Jump Street, an undercover drug sting in Houston has lead to the arrest of six high school students following an eight month operation.

The bust was spearheaded by one male narcotics officer, who posed as a high school senior between August 2014 and March 2015.

On top of the six arrests, an amount of cocaine, marijuana and prescription drugs Xanax and Tramadol was also seized in the bust.

Police have not released any further information on the undercover officer or his age, but say it is not the first time they have performed something like this. 

'School is not a place that you should come in and try to sell your drugs, or come in and buy drugs, you go there to be educated,' Sgt. James Brawner of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office told Click2Houston.

Charged: Jonathan Gonzales, 17 (left), was charged with two counts of delivery of marijuana and Kevin Lambert, 18 (right), was charged with delivery of Marijuana, one fourth ounce

The two schools hit in this operation were Pearland High School and Dawson High School.

However according to Lt. Chris Reioux of the Brazoria County Narcotics Task Force – who jokingly told The Houston Chronicle that he hates the recent Jump Street movies, starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill – said his department has conducted several Jump Street-style undercover operations in recent years.

'I don't think anyone suspects that their classmate is an undercover cop,' Reioux told the newspaper.

'With the recent release of the 'Jump Street' movies, I think they're a little more apprehensive, but it's more of a joking matter – ''you're not '21 Jump Street' are you?''

'They don't believe the person next to them who shows up to school every day, is doing homework next to them, is an undercover officer.'

One adult student and two juvenile students arrested were from Pearland High School. 

21 Jump Street ... only in Houston: Dawson High School was one of two schools hit in the bust.

Bust: The operation was spearheaded by one male officer, who posed as a high school senior between August 2014 and March 2015, in a plot similar to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street (pictured)

Scene: Pearland High School, in Pearland, Texas, south of Houston, has about 3,600 students

The one adult was identified as 18-year-old Aaron Coleman, who was charged with delivery of controlled substance in a drug-free zone (Xanax) and delivery of a dangerous drug (Tramadol).

Three adult students were arrested from Dawson High School: Kevin Lambert, 18; Jonathan Gonzales, 17; and Matthew Van Richardson, 18.

They were all charged with various drug offenses. 

However the investigation is continuing.

'There is still ongoing off campus investigations,' Brawner told The Chron.

'We have wrapped up on campus, and now we are moving out into the communities and trying to further it that way.'

Hit: 21 Jump Street became a huge hit when it was released, starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, in 2012

21 Jump St was released in 2012 and based on a 1980s TV series that starred a young Johnny Depp.

In it, two youthful officers, played by Tatum and Hill, go undercover at a high school to bust a deadly drug ring. 

The actors reprized their roles for the sequel, 22 Jump St, which was released in 2014.
