Beyonce's showstopping new body was the subject of both awe and controversy at last night's Grammy awards.

Now a top celebrity trainer has revealed how the singer, 32, got a leaner and slimmer shape without losing her curves.

Nicole Winhoffer, who counts Madonna among her clients, says that the trick is to work the muscles in a 360 degree-motion rather than a linear one.

New body: Beyonce looked leaner than ever at the Grammys last night - but hasn't lost her famous curves

Trick of the trade: Celebrity trainer Nicole Winhoffer says the secret to a curvy-yet-lean body like Beyonce is to work the muscles in a 360 degree-motion rather than a linear one

She told MailOnline: 'Shaping the muscles at 360 degrees is 
important to maintain a feminine figure, rather than the conventional 
linear motion you see by using machines at gyms.'

Also contributing to Beyonce's new body, no doubt, is the 22-day vegan challenge she embarked on with husband Jay-Z in December.

The plant-based diet included 
low-calorie dishes like vanilla chia pudding with fresh berries and hemp
 hummus with raw vegetables.

Ms Winhoffer says Beyonce's body yesterday represents a marked change from her more muscular shape of last year.

'We can see a major change in her body 
from previous years. She represents female empowerment and embodies it 
on stage, her body is lean and elongated but most importantly, feminine.

'She
 was able to keep her V shape while maintaining her rear, keeping it 
plump and lifted.'

She says this new silhouette is the holy grail for a female client.

'This is the secret to any weight loss success. 
Slimming down while staying curvy.'

And Ms Winhoffer, a former dancer, has done exactly that with Madonna, who she has trained for the past five years.

Since the pair have been working together, Madonna's body has become less muscly and more lean.

'This is my hope for every female I work 
with,' she says. 'To embrace and own who you are. Movement frees the body and 
results follow, this is my mission for fitness.'

While Beyonce drew plenty 
of praise for her body following her Drunk In Love performance last night, many were 
distressed that she showed quite so much of it.

Thousands
 of concerned parents across the U.S. slammed her routine and 
lingerie-inspired outfit as too risque for children after it aired at 8pm on both coasts and at 7pm central time.

Many took to Twitter to share their anger.

Viewer Maria Sanz wrote: 'Watching the 
#GRAMMYs at 8pm with my children(music lovers) performance by Beyoncé 
and her lack of clothing very inappropriate, she's a mom? [sic]'

And Stephen G Peters tweeted: 'Sad day when our kids can't even watch the Grammy's! #Puzzled.'
