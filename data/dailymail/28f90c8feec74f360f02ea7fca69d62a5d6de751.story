An immigrant child sex gang was jailed yesterday by a judge who condemned them for failing to respect Britain by abusing young girls and failing to learn English.

Judge John Bevan QC said the four Roma men and boys and an Iraqi Kurd had ignored the responsibilities of living in this country as he sentenced them for raping and sexually assaulting five girls aged as young as 12.

The Old Bailey had heard how the victims had been forced to have sex with men for money, which was used to buy drugs and alcohol. One of the girls had become pregnant and another had self-harmed.

Judge Bevan told the five gang 
members: ‘The combination of the crimes you have committed and your 
attitude to these crimes both in this country and this court bring 
discredit on all of you in the dock and does a disservice to your fellow
 Roma who want to work hard in this country, improve themselves and make
 a positive contribution.

‘If
 you want to live in this country you must do so in an appropriate way. 
With rights come responsibilities, which you have singularly failed to 
take.’

He added that the 
gang members’ failure to learn English well enough to follow their 
lengthy trial, despite having lived legally in Peterborough, 
Cambridgeshire, for between five and 12 years, meant that taxpayers 
would foot a bill for interpreters of up to £40,000.

‘The
 fact is that the defendants all came to this country with their 
families between five and ten years ago and the majority are still 
teenagers,’ the judge said.

‘The
 acquisition of a new language is not difficult if you put your mind to 
it. They have not attempted to learn the language of the country of 
their choice.’

The gang’s 
Roma ringleader, Zdeno Mirga, 18, known as ‘the boss’, was sentenced to 
16-and-a-half years in a young offenders’ institution for eight counts 
of rape and one count of inciting child prostitution.

The Old Bailey heard one of the girls was attacked in a Wendy House in a children's play area

Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway praised the bravery of the victims in coming forward and then going though with the court case.

'Today gives those girls justice. Those who abused them are now behind bars,' he said.

'I'm pleased with today's sentences as it shows how seriously we, and the courts, take this kind of offending. It sends a clear message that we will not tolerate those who seek to exploit vulnerable young people.

'We will do everything in our power to put them before the courts.'

The investigation was the first trial under Operation Erle, a joint inquiry between Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council's children's services.

Gillian Beasley, chief executive of Peterborough City Council, said social services and police had taken time to slowly gain the trust of all the victims and ensure they felt safe.

'It is a long road to recovery for these girls,' she said.

'We will give them the best support we can possibly give them to step down that road to lead a normal life.'

Iraqi
 Kurd drug dealer Hassan Abdulla, 33, branded a ‘dangerous predatory 
paedophile’ by the judge, was jailed for 20 years for four rapes and 
three counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Renato Balog, 18, a Roma who helped Abdulla sell drugs, will serve 12 years for five rapes and three sexual assaults.

The
 judge described him as a ‘bully with an overgrown sexual appetite’. Jan
 Kandrac, 17, also from a Roma community, will serve five-and-a-half 
years in a young offender institution for one count of rape and two of 
indecent assault on a child.

The
 youngest member of the gang, a 14-year-old Roma who cannot be 
identified for legal reasons, was given a non-custodial six-month youth 
rehabilitation order for sexual activity with a child.

Four
 of the gang members are from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Two of 
the victims are Czech and Slovak, while the other three are English. One
 has ‘serious learning difficulties’ and an IQ of 54.

In
 a statement to the court, one of the victims, known as Girl A, said: ‘I
 felt upset and scared, the boys told me if I told police they would 
kill me and my family and I thought they would. I am still frightened 
that they will kill me when they get out.’

Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway of Cambridgeshire Police praised the bravery of the victims.

He
 said: ‘Today gives those girls justice. I’m pleased with today’s 
sentences as it shows how seriously we, and the courts, take this kind 
of offending. We will do everything in our power to put them before the 
courts.’
