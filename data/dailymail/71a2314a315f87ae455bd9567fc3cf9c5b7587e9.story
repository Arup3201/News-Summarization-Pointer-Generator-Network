The naming of Little Chef will be a blow to a company that has made efforts to move upmarket in recent years by employing Michelin star chef Heston Blumenthal to redesign its menus

Around half of takeaways and restaurants are putting people at risk by failing to offer satisfactory hygiene levels, it has been revealed.

Big brand chains like Chicken Cottage, Dixy Chicken and even La Tasca and Little Chef are failing to maintain the highest levels of cleanliness in their kitchens.

The details have been compiled by consumer champion Which? based on hygiene inspections by local councils across some 2,000 postcodes.

It says urgent action is needed to 
tackle a food poisoning epidemic that has afflicted as many as 17million
people over the last two years.

A
national system in England and Wales, overseen by the Food Standards 
Agency, ranks food outlets on a basis of zero to five stars in terms of 
hygiene.

A score of zero is classed as ‘urgent improvement necessary’, while five equates to ‘very good’.

Which?
is calling for a change in the law to require all food outlets, 
including supermarkets, to display they hygiene star rating in their 
windows.

Research by the 
group found that three in four people would not eat at a food outlet 
that received a food hygiene rating below a score of three, which means 
‘generally satisfactory’.

However, Which? found that almost half – 48per cent - of outlets in some parts of Bexley on the London Kent borders fall below this level.

Bexley had six of the worst areas studied, while the highest proportion of suspect food outlets was in the DA17 postcode area of the borough. Parts of Powys, Sutton, Croydon and Kingston-Upon-Thames also had poor results.

Looking at take-aways chains some three in ten – 29per cent - Chicken Cottage outlets scored less than ‘generally satisfactory’ on hygiene.

Big brand chains including La Tasca and Little Chef are failing to maintain the highest levels of cleanliness in their kitchens

The figure was around one in four for Dixy Chicken, Perfect Pizza and Favorite.

In the restaurant category, one in five – 18per cent - La Tasca outlets scored poorly along with one in seven – 13per cent – for Little Chef.

The naming of Little Chef will be a 
blow to a company that has made efforts to move upmarket in recent years
by, for example, employing Michelin star chef Heston Blumenthal to 
redesign its menus.

Which? 
found that around one in five of some convenience store chains had a 
hygiene rating of below three.  These included Best In/One, Costcutter, 
Premier and Londis.

Carluccio's restaurants, founded by chef Antonio Carluccio, were found to be clean and safe

The same research also identified outlets which were always clean and safe.

These included Carluccio’s, Eat, Marriot Hotels, Premier Inn and Zizzi. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our investigation shows that food hygiene is an unacceptable postcode lottery. 

‘Diners shouldn’t be taking a risk with their health simply by choosing the wrong area in which to eat out.

‘We want everywhere that serves food to the public to display their hygiene score prominently so people can make an informed choice.’

The companies named by Which? said they had training and controls in place to ensure high standards.

Some said their stores were either independently run or franchised.

La Tasca said it had improved under new management, while Little Chef said it is taking action with lower-rated restaurants.

Pizza GoGo and Dixy Chicken both said that they believed that some of the suspect outlets were no longer part of their companies.

Chicken Cottage did not comment.
