China’s first budget airline is poised to lobby industry regulators for permission to install standing-only ‘seats’ on its planes so it can cram more people on board.

Shanghai-based Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat, according to China National Radio.

It’s not the first time the idea has been floated – Dublin-based Ryanair famously proposed selling standing-only tickets in 2009 to increase passenger traffic and cut costs.

China's Spring Airlines wants to install 'vertical seats' on its planes so it can cram more passengers on board

Spring Airlines chairman Wang Zhenghua confirmed to China National Radio that he wants standing-only cabins on his planes and is seeking government approval.

The 70-year-old billionaire told the broadcaster that he began exploring the idea in 2008 after a chaotic Chinese New Year travel rush.

Customers told China National Radio that they would be hesitant to buy a ticket for a vertical seat out of safety concerns.

One told the broadcaster that she fears passengers would be injured when the plane flies through bad weather or is rocked by turbulence.

Spring Airlines plans to work with manufacturers on a design that would include a safety belt.

The low-cost carrier, founded in 2004, offers flights as cheap as £1 ($1.50) and flies to destinations in China, Japan, Thailand and other Asian countries.

Even though designs have been proposed and no-frills airlines have expressed interest, the vertical seat concept has not taken off because it hasn’t received approval from authorities.

Ryanair abandoned its proposal in 2012 after it was thwarted by an unnamed regulator.

The Irish carrier planned to install ten rows of vertical seats on its planes – increasing capacity by about 40 passengers – and charge less than £5 to travellers who were willing to stand.

Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use

Italian firm Aviointeriors designed the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys

Last year, Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use.

The design, intended for short-haul flights, would increase capacity for airlines and leave passengers with even less space.

In 2010, Italian firm Aviointeriors unveiled its design for the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys.

In that seat passengers would sit at an angle with just 23in of legroom between them and the seat in front of them – about seven inches less than the average seat pitch on most planes.
