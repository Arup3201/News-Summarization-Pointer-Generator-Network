The left side of Zakia's face is completely missing - corrosive battery acid burnt away her nose,eye and cheek.

It took just a second for her husband to throw the fluid in her face and destroy her life forever.

After seven years of abuse, she had finally summoned up the courage to divorce him and he punished the mother of his children by attacking her outside the courthouse.

Changed forever: The left side of Zakia's face is completely missing - corrosive battery acid burnt away her nose, eye and cheek

Over time, the scar tissue is becoming more uncomfortable through tightening, pulling against her mouth and making it difficult for her to eat or drink and even smile at her children. 

Most of the time the 39-year-old is too afraid to leave the house, and when she does she wears an black niqab and sunglasses.

Zakia is one of the women featured in Saving Face, which is aired tomorrow night on Channel 4.

The Oscar -wining documentary 
chronicles the journey of pioneering British plastic surgeon Dr Mohammad
Jawad as he goes back to Pakistan, to help the recovery of acid-attack 
victims.

With little or no access to reconstructive surgery, survivors are physically and emotionally scarred.

The Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) estimates there are approximately 1,500 acid attacks a year globally.

Acid violence is a worldwide phenomenon that is not restricted to a particular race, religion or geographical location.

It occurs in many countries in South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the West Indies and the Middle East, and there is anecdotal evidence of attacks in other regions.

In many countries acid attacks constitute a hidden form of violence against women and children that often goes unreported, and the true number of horrific attacks taking place has only come to light after in-depth research.

Every year in Pakistan, over 100 people -
most of them women - are known to be victimised by brutal acid attacks,
while numerous other cases go unreported.

The availability of acid for use in the cotton industry had led to assaults 
often linked to domestic violence or revenge attacks by rejected men.

Dr Jawad is the surgeon responsible for treating British acid-attack victim Katie Piper, who now credits him as her 'hero.'

He
began travelling back to his birthplace every three months and holding free 
clinics -funded by charities including Islamic Help - to perform 
life-changing surgery.

In most cases, there is only so much Dr Jawad can do to restore an acid-scarred face.

'We can't be God and re-create all you've lost,' he says.

Another woman featured in the 40-minute film is 23-year-old mother Rukhsana.

Her
husband threw acid on her and then her sister-in-law poured petrol over 
her.

Attacked: 23-year-old mother Rukhsana - her husband threw acid on her. Then her sister-in-law poured petrol over her. Finally her mother-in-law took a match and set her on fire

Finally her mother-in-law took a match and set her on fire, leaving her to writhe in agony on the floor of her home.

Her 'crime' was daring to leave the family home with her children and then returning.

Despite the attack, Rukhsana remains 
in her in-laws' home, hoping that one day she will be reunited 
with her daughter, who is kept from her part of the house by a brick 
wall.

In the film she shows the crew the room where she was attacked and says 'This is where they burned me alive. My life was destroyed in this room.' 

Many reported assailants, typically a 
husband or someone else close to the victim, receive minimal punishment 
from the stat, but cases being brought to court are rare.

Vital help: British plastic surgeon Dr Mohammad Jawad as he goes back to Pakistan to help the recovery of acid-attack victims

Zakia's husband, Pervez, denies he 
threw battery acid in his wife's face, but admit his 'dignity' was 
threatened when she tried to divorce him.

As he awaits trial, he has threatened to harm her again if he's found innocent.

As Zakia is bravely fighting for her husband to be brought to justice, Dr Jawad is working to alleviate the pain and restore functioning and features to her face.

There is a set back when he uncovers the place where her 
right eye had been and finds the socket incapable of 
even holding a glass eye.

But he manages to replace some of the scar tissue with a recently developed artificial skin.

The charity states acid violence is a worldwide phenomenon that is not restricted to a particular race, religion or geographical location.
