A documentary it certainly is not, but a new television show is discussing the highs and lows of British history using a cast of drunk historians.

The controversial series, named Drunk History, begins tonight on Comedy Central and is sure to divide viewers.

A runaway web series success in the US, the show features comedians getting very drunk and telling their own version of a true historical story.

For the first episode, Rob Beckett and Kerry Howard boozily narrate tales from the reigns of Henry VIII and Queen Victoria.

The liquored-up series, originally produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay in the US, will be hosted by Jimmy Carr and feature an ever-changing cast of actors and comedians.

The series will travel across the country to present these the stories in almost every UK city.

As the comedians narrate the tales they are most passionate about, a host of other well-known actors, celebrities and other comedians will act out the new, blurry versions of history.

This week, Rob Beckett takes on the story of how Henry the VII met his future wife, Anne of Cleves

Rob narrates his own newly-revised version of the story, which is then acted out by other comedians 

In tonight's episode, Beckett - after knocking back three pints of strong lager, eight whiskies and six shots of Sambuca - settles in to tell the tale of when King Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves.

'We all know King Henry VIII was an absolute nightmare with women, but his decision to marry Anne of Cleves was an absolute shocker,' he begins, tripping over his own words.

'So King Henry VII is like, 'Cromwell, mate, I need some help. I need a new wife. I haven't had the best luck, you know what I mean?''

The British series, hosted by Jimmy Carr, will tour the nation, recounting tales in almost every UK city

'And Cromwell is like, "Henry! I've found one for you. Germany. Fit bird."'

It all goes downhill from there.

Comedy Central describes the show as: 'The bits you missed in history class, as told by drunk comedians.'
