Jailed: John Fesler Lane II has served 20 years for spats over his former home - and 10 days ago he ended up back in jail for threatening its owners

A couple held a 73-year-old man at gunpoint after he allegedly threatened to 'take back' their ranch, which he had lost during a 1979 divorce.

Police arrived at the home in Florence, Montana on September 15 to find the couple, Lucinda and Lee Hayne, focusing their guns on John Fesler Lance II as he knelt outside the house.

Lance, who previously served 20 years in prison over previous spats over the property, pleaded not guilty to felony intimidation and violating a protective order in Hamilton on Wednesday.

He remains in jail with a bail set at $200,000.

His court appearance comes just months after he was released in March following more than 20 years in prison for intimidating judges, attorneys and others involved in the divorce case.

Then in April until July, he was back in prison for violating a protective order the Haynes had filed.  

Lance lost his Florence-area ranch in a default judgment for failing to answer his wife's petition seeking a divorce, County Attorney Bill Fulbright said.

Fulbright said Lance was convicted of threatening the judge who made the ruling, an attorney who prosecuted and others he perceived as being involved in his loss of the ranch.

He served more than 20 years in the state prison so he could be released without being on parole, - but the day after his release, he was spotted loitering outside Lucinda Hayne's workplace.

He was arrested and sat in jail until his July trial where he was convicted of violating a permanent restraining order and sentenced to time served, Fulbright said.

Over the past several months, the Haynes or their attorney received correspondence from Lance threatening to use any force necessary to 'take the ranch back,' including kidnapping the Haynes and holding them for ransom, court records said.

Earlier this month, the Montana Supreme Court rejected Lance's attempt to overturn a permanent order of protection the Haynes were granted against him.

On September 15, Lance called attorney William Jones from Missoula, distraught, and said he was going back to his ranch. Jones contacted authorities.

Lucinda Haynes told officers that she was outside tending to her horses when she saw Lance's scooter driving towards the house. She went inside and retrieved her pistol. 

When she went outside, she asked him who he was and he responded: 'This is John Lance', the Missoulian reported.

She pointed her gun at him and ordered him to get to his knees, and when her husband heard a commotion, he joined his wife and pointed his own gun at her. 

The Haynes said that while they waited for deputies to arrive, Lance rambled on about the ranch, told them they were trespassing and he had the right to use force to evict them.

The couple told officers they were forced to drastically change their lives after Lance was released from prison, including always having someone stay on the property and not having visitors, charging documents said.

The county attorney's office has filed for persistent felony status in the case, which means, if convicted, Lance could receive a minimum prison sentence of five to 100 years.
