The fate of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, two British ships lost at sea while searching for the Northwest Passage, has been a mystery that has baffled Naval historians for more than 160 years.

The two ships, along with their captains and 129 men, were last seen sailing north of Canada in July 1845. It is believed the doomed boats became trapped in sea ice, and that the crew may even have resorted to cannibalism to stay alive, but their exact fate has remained unknown, until now.

Yesterday the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that underwater drones using sonar had located one of the two boats at the bottom of the Victoria Strait, near King William Island, Nunavut.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that one of two fabled British explorer ships, the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, that disappeared in the Arctic more 160 years ago has been found

Discovery: A second image shared by Parks Canada shows another side-scan. It is not clear which of the two ships it is, but officials said it is definitely one of the pair

Ill-fated voyage: Both ships sailed from London to Baffin Bay, when they were last seen by two whaling ships. A note found by a later rescue mission detailed the rest of their journey, though the exact location of the wrecks remained a mystery until now

Mr Harper said it was too early to tell which of the vessels it was, but images beamed back to the surface contain enough information to confirm that it is one of the two. 

In 2008, Canada announced it would search for the ships in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the passage, which was found during searches for the missing ships. 

He said: 'This is truly a historic moment for Canada. This has been a great Canadian story and mystery and the subject of scientists, historians, writers and singers so I think we really have an important day in mapping the history of our country.'

He added: 'Finding the first vessel will no doubt provide the momentum – or wind in our sails – necessary to locate its sister ship and find out even more about what happened to the Franklin Expedition’s crew.'

Archeologists have hailed the find as highly significant, saying it is likely that items on board are well preserved and may include the bodies of crew members or photographs of their voyage.

HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were heavily-armoured bomb ships, and two years before the mission to the Northwest Passage, they had taken an expedition captained by James Clark Ross to the Antarctic.

Despite his experience in exploring polar waters, Ross turned down the latest mission, viewing it as too dangerous, so instead the command of Erebus passed to Sir John Franklin with Terror captained by Francis Crozier.

The pair departed on their ill-fated expedition from London in May 1845, and were last seen sailing towards the Lancaster Sound by two whaling ships in July that year. After that, they were never seen again.  

While no one knows for sure exactly what happened to the crew, experts believe the ships were lost in 1848 after they became locked in the ice near King William Island and that the crews abandoned them in a hopeless bid to reach safety.  

In 1854, an explorer by the name of John Rae came across an Inuit who claimed to have met the expedition, and produced a small silver plate with the engraving ‘Sir John Franklin K.C.B’. However, the man also told Rae that the explorers had resorted to cannibalism in order to stay alive.

What happened to them? Mystery still surrounds exactly what happened to the crew, who are depicted in 1847 depiction by W Turner Smith. It is widely believed the expedition was troubled by thick ice and that most of the men died of starvation - although Inuits reported at the time that some turned to cannibalism

Eventually an expedition to King William Island, near to where the wreck has now been found, discovered a note written by Franklin which revealed that the expedition camped at Beechy Island between 1845-6, the Erebus and Terror then sailed southwards to the entrance of Victoria Strait. 

Here on September 12, 1846 the two vessels became trapped in ice north of King William Island, and spent two winters here between September 1846 and April 1848. 

The note says Franklin died on 11 June 1847, without giving a cause of death, and the command passed onto Francis Crozier. Abandoning their ships on April 22, 1848, 105 survivors led by Crozier set out toward Back River. 

After that, historians rely on Inuit accounts for the fate of the men, and believe that some may have headed back to the stricken ships, which sank at different times. It is thought some survivors may have lived as late as 1850.

The failure of the expedition was a huge event in England in the mid-19th century; The Globe and Mail likened it to a moon landing gone wrong today. 

Franklin's vessels are among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology, and Harper said the discovery would shed light on what happened to Franklin's crew. Tantalizing traces have been found over the years, including the bodies of three crewmen discovered in the 1980s.

The bodies of two English seamen - John Hartnell, 25, and Royal Marine William Braine, 33 - were exhumed in 1986. An expedition uncovered the perfectly preserved remains of a petty officer, John Torrington, 20, in an ice-filled coffin in 1984.

Franklin's disappearance prompted one of history's largest and longest rescue searches, from 1848 to 1859, which resulted in the passage's discovery. The original search for the ships helped open up parts of the Canadian Arctic for discovery back in the 1850s. 

The route runs from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago. European explorers sought the passage as a shorter route to Asia, but found it rendered inhospitable by ice and weather.

With the melting Arctic ice now unlocking the shipping route Franklin was after, Harper's government searched for the ship in order to stake a claim on the passage.

Sunday's discovery came shortly after a team of archaeologists found a tiny fragment from the Franklin expedition. Searchers discovered an iron fitting that once helped support a boat from one of the doomed expedition's ships in the King William Island search area.

The search for an Arctic passage to Asia frustrated explorers for centuries, beginning with John Cabot's voyage in 1497. Eventually it became clear that a passage did exist, but was too far north for practical use.

Cabot, the Italian-British explorer, died in 1498 while trying to find it and the shortcut eluded other famous explorers including Henry Hudson and Francis Drake. No sea crossing was successful until Roald Amundsen of Norway completed his trip from 1903-1906.

The HMS Erebus which sank in the Victoria Strait along with the HMS Terror after an ill-fated expedition to find the Northwest Passage

In May 1845 Captain Sir John Franklin set off from London to find the Northwest Passage, a rumoured trading route which European merchants hoped would cut shipping times to Asia.

Sailing on board the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, along with 129 hand-picked crew and enough supplies to last seven years, Franklin sailed north to Baffin Bay, between Greenland and Canada, before turning into Lancaster Sound.

In July 1845 two whaling vessels recorded spotting Franklin and his ships as they sailed past. That was to be the last sighting of either vessel for nearly 160 years.

Back in London, in 1847, after months without contact from Franklin, another Arctic explorer by the name of James Clark Ross raised the alarm, saying a search party should be sent to look for them.

However, believing the boats had enough supplies to last another year at least, the Navy delayed sending a search party until 1848.

No trace of the boats or their crews could be found, despite a £20,000 reward being offered for any captain who brought back news of the ill-fate expedition. It wasn't until 1850 that a camp at Beechy Island was discovered, though there was no note explaining where the boats had gone.

Later, in 1854, explorer John Rae came across an Inuit who claimed to have passed the vessels as they were dragged along by their crew, and produced a silver plate with Franlink's initials engraved on it as proof.

However, the man also said that he had seen the crews resorting to cannibalism in order to survive, a claim that is still hotly debated.

Finally in 1857 Captain F.L. Mc’Clintock, sailing on a mission funded by Franklin's wife, discovered the remains of a camp on William Island, along with a note detailing the last movements of Franklin and his crew.

The note, which had originally be written saying everything was going well, was penned over with a message revealing how everything had gone wrong.

After spending the winter from 1845-6 at a camp on Beechy Island, Franklin sailed his ships south towards Victoria Strait before becoming stuck in ice north of King William Island where the crew spent two winters between September 1846 and April 1848.

According to the note, Franklin died on 11 June 1847, though no cause is given. The command passed to Francis Crozier, who waited until 22 April 1848 before taking 105 survivors and heading for the mainland.

Nothing more is known about Crozier, or what became of the men, though it is thought that several may have returned to the ships and lived there until 1850, before the vessels sank to the bottom of the sea.
