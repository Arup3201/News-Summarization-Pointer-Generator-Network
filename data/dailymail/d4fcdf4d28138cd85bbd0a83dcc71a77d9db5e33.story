At Sporting Lisbon's campus in Alcohete, south of the River Tagus, images of Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo decorate the walls. For now, at least, they serve as a reminder that success in football does not always have to be measured in league titles.

When Real Madrid's Ronaldo secured his second Ballon d'Or earlier this year, it was the third time since 2000 that the World Player of the Year had been a graduate of the Portuguese club's fabled academy. Of all of Europe's talent factories, only Barcelona's famed La Masia can beat Sporting's record.

Yet while the senior side have not won a Primera Liga title since 2002, there was progress last season at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, Sporting's impressive, modern 50,000-capacity stadium.  A second-place finish in the league represented a fair improvement on seventh the previous season.

Done deal: Sporting Lisbon and Dundee United have reached an agreement on player Ryan Gauld

Costly: Gauld has a £48m release clause in his Sporting Lisbon contract

Promise: Sporting Lisbon signed talented teenager Gauld from Dundee United on a six-year contract

But at a club that so values its own production line, further optimism was to be found in the rise of the new generation of Alcohete academy graduates, continuing the trend set by illustrious predecessors such as Ronaldo, Figo, Joao Moutinho, Nani, Simao Sabrosa and Ricardo Quaresma.

Last season, William Carvalho, 22, was Portugal's Player of the Season and Manchester United are currently pondering a £37.5million move.

Carlos Mane is merely the latest electric winger in green and white to roll off the Sporting conveyor belt.

Another 20-year-old, the versatile Eric Dier, may be English but he has been attached to Sporting since the age of nine and wore the name Eric, rather than Dier, on his back in a nod to his Iberian surroundings.

Dier captained each of Sporting's age-group XIs before breaking through, at 19, into the senior side and became a stand-out.

Esteemed company then, for young Ryan Gauld, following his stunning £3million move from Dundee United that was finally announced on the Tannadice club's website at 5.30am on Tuesday.

According to former Falkirk attacker Pedro Moutinho, there could be no better place for the 18-year-old from Laurencekirk to turn his huge potential into stardom than at a club whose faith in youth has rendered them Portugal's fame academy.

As a highly-rated Portugal Under-21 player in his early days, Moutinho starred alongside kids with big futures like Paulo Ferreira, later of Porto and Chelsea, and former Stamford Bridge and Juventus star Tiago Mendes.

And from 34-year-old Moutinho's local knowledge, the former Maritimo attacker expects Gauld - who was scouted by Aurelio Pereira, the talent spotter who found Ronaldo - to be stuck straight in centre stage from the very minute the new Portuguese season kicks off.

'Just like anywhere, money is tight in Portugal and it's very rare for a team to spend £3million on a teenager,' former SPL striker Moutinho told Sportsmail.

'Sporting would simply not do that then stick him in their feeder team. They will have done their homework thoroughly on Ryan and I think you'll see him at No 10 next season. Sporting will play a 4-3-3 with Ryan just off the striker and I think he will flourish there because, from what I've seen, it's his best position.

'It's a terrific move for Ryan because, at Benfica and Porto, the pressure would be huge. They are massive clubs that win a lot but Sporting haven't won the title for a long time and while they are a huge club, too, expectations are higher elsewhere.

'Not so long ago Sporting had financial problems but they changed their president and last season they did very well, finishing second to reach the Champions League. Their last manager, Leonardo Jardim, left for Monaco at the end of the season and they've brought in a young Portuguese coach, Marco Silva, who is 36. 

'Sporting will be looking to improve next season - and they will see Ryan Gauld as a key part of that. He will have a lot of the ball and the time to create. Apart from against the big two, teams will largely be defending against Sporting.  'It's also the perfect club because of the way they develop their young players, both home-grown and bought in. Sporting are renowned as having the best academy in the country, one of the finest in Europe. 

'They have a good name after developing players like Figo, Ronaldo and Quaresma. But the development does not stop after the youth team. It continues right up until they sell players.' 

That brings Moutinho on to the staggering £48m release clause in Gauld's contract with Sporting Lisbon, which could see United quadruple their £3m transfer fee.

'That's a common practice in Portugal, to protect your investment,' said Moutinho.

'If you look at James Rodriguez (Colombia's World Cup star striker), he was brought from Argentina by Porto and sold for £35m (to Monaco), and Axel Witsel of Belgium was brought in (by Benfica) and sold for a similar big fee to Zenit St Petersburg. 

'But for each of those success stories, there are players who come in with a clause and then leave for far less, or drop out of the game. I suspect Sporting will have a four-year plan for Ryan to improve him then sell him on for a big profit.  'I don't think Gauld will be the last big export out of Scotland. I work as a coach in the Forth Valley Under-14 academy and I am seeing a huge difference in the quality of local players to when I first arrived in Scotland 10 years ago. 

'As a result of clubs having less money, young local players are getting more of a chance and it's definitely for the good of the Scottish game. Ryan's move will also benefit Scottish football because nobody in Portugal knows a lot about Scottish football. But £3m for a Scottish teenager will make everyone sit up and notice. 

'It will be hard for Ryan, adjusting to the culture and the language, and when the league kicks off next month it will be roasting hot. But I think Ryan will succeed because he's got the skill and, it seems, the temperament, too. He's a terrific player, very technical.' 

The last Scot to sign for a Portuguese club was Stephen McPhee when he left Port Vale for Beira Mar in 2004. The Glaswegian, who had spells at St Mirren, Hull City and Blackpool but is now retired, last night warned Gauld to expect a culture shock. But the 33-year-old also believes Gauld's first taste of the Sporting v Benfica derby will remind him of Scotland.

'When any of the big three - Benfica, Sporting and Porto - meet each other, everything grinds to a halt,' McPhee told Sportsmail. 

'But the biggest game in the country is Benfica against Sporting because they are both from Lisbon. It is similar to the Rangers v Celtic rivalry. It's fiercely passionate and there are three daily newspapers devoted solely to football.

'It's going to be very different to what Ryan is used to. He will find the training more intense but the lifestyle more laid back. There's never a rush to do anything. 

'I remember when I moved over to Beira Mar we were doing morning sessions and going for a sleep and then doing afternoon sessions.

'I thought it was just pre-season training because back home I was used to training in the mornings. But then it continued through the season and I was like, "what's going on here?" 

'But I learned a lot as a footballer. The game over there is more relaxed, more counter-attack focused. It should improve Ryan's all-round game.

'I didn't get the chance to play at the Alvalade but I did play against Sporting Lisbon at home. They've a great reputation for producing young players - but also for giving young players a chance in their first team.

'My advice to Ryan would be to enjoy the challenge and the opportunity but also try to learn the language. It's something I wish I had put more time into when I was in Portugal. 

'I found the whole experience a change in culture but I loved my time there. Sadly, at the end of the season we were relegated and Hull City came in for me. I would have stayed out in Portugal but I didn't fancy playing in the second tier there. 

'I hope Ryan does well at Sporting and I wish him all the best on his adventures.'
