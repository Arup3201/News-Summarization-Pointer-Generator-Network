Hillary Clinton ruffled feathers when she described herself and husband Bill Clinton as 'dead broke' after they left the White House following his presidency in an interview while on tour for her book Hard Choices earlier in the year.

There followed faux outrage from Conservative pundits at Clinton's claim, seeking to paint Clinton as out of touch and focus attention on the fortune the couple has amassed in the years since, largely due to speaking engagements and book sales.

Now, a Las Vegas newspaper has unearthed documents relating to a speaking engagement Hillary Clinton will undertake at a University of Nevada Las Vegas Foundation fundraiser that detail her travel requirements.

Sought after public speaker: Hillary Clinton seen with her chief of staff Huma Abedin in East Hampton on Saturday August 16

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that Clinton will receive $225,000 to speak at the fundraiser and requires transport on a private jet and accommodations including a 'presidential suite' for herself and rooms for her staff.

She also requested a stenographer to record her speech but does not want to be filmed.

The foundation expects up to 1,000 people to attend the dinner. Table tickets can cost up to $20,000 each. It has raised more than $1 billion for the university since its 1989 inception.

Meanwhile, 
Republicans quietly vetoed a key requirement that members of Congress 
disclose which lobbyists pay for their lavish all-expenses-paid junkets 
around the world in July.

The
 Republican-controlled House of Representatives changed the 30-year-old 
rule just as reports emerged that Congress took more free trips last 
year than any year since 2007 when travel rules were tightened.

The
 National Journal reports that lawmakers and their staff took a combined
 1,887 free trips last year at a cost of almost $6 million.

Travels in style: Clinton greets a fan as she signs copies of her book Hard Choices at BookHampton in East Hampton, New York on Saturday

Clinton left her post at the top of the U.S. State Department on February 1, 2013, but the federal government spent more than $55,000 on travel expenses related to her book tour last month, procurement documents show.

First ladies have historically enjoyed Secret Service protection for life after they leave the White House.

'On
 a foreign trip like that, State Department sometimes pays the original 
bill and Secret Service might reimburse it later,' said Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan.

The expenses included a $3,668 charge for her to enjoy a single night's lodging in a suite at the posh Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris.

That rate corresponds to the cost of a suite with a 'large and superbly appointed marble bathroom,' a 'deep soaking tub,' 'sparkling chandeliers' and 'elegant period furniture,' according to the Four Seasons website.

Purchase orders also show that 
taxpayers footed the bill for a $5,100 rental of three Mercedes-Benz 
executive limousine vans during a single day in Berlin.

Donovan 
told MailOnline that sometimes the State Department arranges for foreign
 travel for dignitaries who get Secret Service protection.

'We
 would have requested the cars' in Berlin and Paris, he added, 'because 
we want to have control of that car that she rides in.'

Rental cars for Secret Service agents in Paris totaled $11,291.

The
 government spent another $35,183 on lodging there, but the purchase 
order doesn't say where Clinton's personal protection detail stayed.

The
 one-time first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state was conducting
 interviews in Europe related to her book 'Hard Choices,' and was not 
traveling on official government business.

In Paris, she was photographed repeatedly with French President Francois Hollande â€“ and the 635-page tome.
