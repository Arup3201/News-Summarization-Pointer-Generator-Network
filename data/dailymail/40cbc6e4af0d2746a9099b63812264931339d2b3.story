The first planets outside the solar system were confirmed in 1992, uninhabitable worlds around a pulsar 1,000 light years away.

Over the next 17 years the discoveries of more and more planets started to trickle in.

But in 2009, with the launch of Nasa’s Kepler telescope, the number of confirmed planets shot up from several hundred to over a thousand – and with it our chances of finding a new Earth have dramatically increased.

This Nasa graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically increased since the launch of Kepler in 2009 and its subsequent studies of distant stars

To date Kepler has found 3,845 planetary candidates, 962 of which have been confirmed as planets.

It was not until last week, however, that astronomers finally found a world they had been trying to find for so long.

Just last week, MailOnline reported that a planet the size of Earth had finally been found orbiting in the so-called habitable zone of a star – the holy grail of planet hunting.

As shown in the graphics on this page, the remarkable amount of planets that are known of is thanks to the Kepler telescope.

It was announced last week that the first Earth-sized planet in a habitable zone of a distant star had been found.

With the discovery of this planet, called Kepler-186f, astronomers are now closer than ever to finding a true Earth 2.0.

‘There could be many of these planets closer by,’ Nasa Kepler scientist Dr Steve Howell told MailOnline.

‘If we can find those and subject them to study, we could see if they have biosignatures in the atmosphere.

‘In the next 20 years I’d say there’s an 80 per cent chance we’ll find a definite habitable planet in our vicinity.

‘If we look at all those planets we won’t see cities or coastlines or green fields, but I think we’ll have a good shot of seeing water vapour and things that make us believe they’re more like Earth.’

It found planets by observing 100,000 stars simultaneously and measuring dips in light if a planet passed in front.

Known as the transit method, this has proved wildly successful and revealed a host of planets.

For a planet to be confirmed, however, three transits must be observed.

This has meant that most of the planets discovered so far are on much tighter orbits than Earth as they complete transits more quickly.

These worlds are inhospitable to life as we know it, but their discoveries has given us a glimpse into the broad range of planets in the universe.

For planets more akin to Earth, that are in more habitable orbits, it takes longer to observe three transits.

This is why it has taken until now to confirm planets the size of Earth in habitable zones, as these planets could not be confirmed until the third transit had been confirmed.

As data of repeated transits is studied, more planets in more 'habitable' orbits will be found.

The Kepler space telescope finds planets using the transit method, which measures the dip in light from stars when a planet passes in front, from which the world's size and orbit can be deduced

Kepler has found many siginificant planet including Kepler 296-f (pictured), a so-called 'super Earth' twice the size of our planet but in the habitable zone of its star, meaning it could have liquid water on its surface

The Kepler telescope is currently ‘dead in the water’ as it has now lost functionality in two of its four reaction wheels.

These were used to point the telescope accurately at distant stars.

However, a bold new plan to save the telescope known as the K2 mission is currently in the works, Nasa’s Steve Howell tells MailOnline.

‘As of May of 2013, Kepler lost its second reaction wheel and that left it with only two,’ he says.

‘The way you point the spacecraft very tightly is using reaction wheels in a 3-axis system.

‘Once you have only two in particular, most people believe your spacecraft can’t be used to point precisely.’

‘So working with engineers at Bell Aerospace we devised this unique plan where we would point the telescope in its orbital plane.

‘Laying flat in that direction, we use the Sun’s light shining on the solar panels to provide a balancing force like a third reaction wheel.’

Nasa's Kepler space telescope, pictured, has been the most successful planet-hunting observatory to date

The discovery of Kepler-186f, artist's rendering pictured, was announced last week. It is the first Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone of a star, and could signal that there are Earth 2.0s waiting to be found in Kepler's data

The team have spent the fall trying the new mission proposal out and the spring testing the data acquisition.

Now they know that it works ‘incredibly well’ and they have given their proposal to repurpose the telescope to Nasa.

They are hoping for funding to continue operating the mission for the next two or three years.

Via this method they will be limited to planets in orbits of 40 days or so.

But they will be observing planets in orbits around stars different to those that were observed in the initial mission.

Namely, the stars will be more like our own sun than those in the original ‘Kepler field,’ which was mainly stars dimmer than our sun known as M-type stars such as red dwarfs.

This new mission will give astronomers further information on how common planets are around stars like our sun.

And ultimately, considering the huge numbers of planets found by the observatory so far, it could be yet another feather in the cap of this famous planet hunting telescope.
