An Iranian-born man who has been jailed for sexually assaulting a woman told a court he had found it difficult to 'adjust' to Australian women's 'revealing garments'.

Amir Mohebbifar was sentenced to at least six years in prison for aggravated sexual assault after he attacked a 19-year-old woman on Sydney's Anzac Bridge on January 16.

The 27-year-old arrived at Christmas Island in 2013 and had been granted a bridging visa.

He had told the court he initially had issues with the clothing of Australian women but had always been taught to respect people.

Mohebbifar approached the 19-year-old woman on the Anzac Bridge early on January 16. 

She initially managed to brush off his questions and walk away, but soon after heard his footsteps quickening into a run towards her. 

Despite her screaming and protests, he pushed her into a bush and sexually assaulted her, Judge Woodburne said.

He unzipped his pants but suddenly stopped and left.

Police later discovered Mohebbifar 'hiding under a car, sweating profusely and breathing heavily'.

'To be accosted, seized and dragged off the street by a complete stranger must have been terrifying,' Judge Woodburne said on Wednesday during his sentencing.

'She was doing nothing more than peacefully going about her business walking along public streets to go home.' 

The court heard Mohebbifar had felt excluded, depressed and socially isolated in the lead-up to the attack and did not know why he carried it out. 

'I wasn't myself and I'm truly sorry,' he said.

He said he had stopped the assault after unzipping his pants because 'it was like suddenly my conscience woke up'.

'He wanted a girlfriend but was not sure how to make contact,' Judge Woodburne said.

Mohebbifar cried as he was sentenced to a minimum of six years and a maximum of eight. 

'The fact that he will or might be deported is irrelevant to this sentencing exercise,' Judge Woodburne said.

He will be eligible for parole in January 2020.
