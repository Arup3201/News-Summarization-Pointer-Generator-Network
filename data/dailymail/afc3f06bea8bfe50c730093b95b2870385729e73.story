The 17-month-old daughter of a parenting columnist has been shot by her 3-year-old brother.

Emma Carper is expected to make a full recovery after the bullet missed all of her vital organs.

The shooting was said to be an accident after the 3-year-old son, Jaron, got ahold of his father Justin Carper's gun which was lying on a dresser in the family's Shelby, North Carolina home.

Mr Carper is a parenting and self-help columnist for the local paper in addition to running a car dealership.

Self-help: The children's 26-year-old father Justin Carper is an inspirational speaker and runs a car dealership

The shooting took place at around 11.30am Thursday and by that evening he had still not been charged with any crimes relating to failing to secure his weapon or endangering children.

The sheriff's department said that they will be reaching out to the district attorney who will then make the final decision about whether or not to file charges.

The Charlotte Observer noted that children under 6-years-old cannot face criminal charges in the state, clearing Jaron of any consequences.

Local station WSOC-TV reports that the family was doing renovations on the home and had the 9mm gun on the dresser temporarily when the 3-year-old grabbed it.

Mr Carper posted updates about his 
daughter's condition on Thursday after the initial rush to Cleveland 
Regional Medical Center.

Thankful: Carper posted updates shortly after his daughter had been rushed to the hospital

Just two hours after the shooting, he posted a message saying 'God is good'.

'Seeing my little girl run across the floor laughing is pretty special tonight!' he wrote later on Thursday.

The 26-year-old father works as a youth leader in his community and writes inspirational posts on his personal blog.

'I am focused on “being exceptional”. Everyone is exceptional at something,' he wrote on the blog, which features a portrait of he and his wife Beth jokingly posing with their two children.

'My goal is to help you discover the “exceptional you”. As a result, I write about personal development, faith, family, and leadership,' he explains on the blog, which features a portait of he and his wife Beth jokingly posing with their two children.
