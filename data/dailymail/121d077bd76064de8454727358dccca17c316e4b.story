A  lawmaker wants to hand out Vladimir Putin's sperm to Russian women en masse in a bid to create a new generation of 'military and political elite'.

Yelena Borisovna Mizoulina, the Chairwoman of Parliamentary Commission on women's affairs, children and family, told colleagues that giving the president's sperm to would-be mothers would improve patriotism in Russia. 

Ms Mizoulina, who has a PhD in law, made the bizarre proposal during a round table discussion on  fertility in Russia.

According to the Russian-language newspaper, Trust, she told the State Duma that Putin's brood would then be given 'special allowances' from the state, in return for their  'devotion' to the country.

She said: 'The essence of my proposition is simple.

'Every citizen of Russia will receive by mail the genetic material of the president, to get pregnant from him and have a baby. These mothers will receive a special allowance from the state.'

Adopting the assumption that Putin's offspring would be male, she went on to describe how the children would be educated in 'special institutions that resemble Souvorov Schools' - a type of boarding school in the former Soviet Union. 

The aim would be that the child would be 'devoted to the homeland and personally to the President of the Russian Fedaration', she said.

She added: 'Children born from the Russian president in the future will form the military and political elite of the state.'

But Mikhail Klikishin told the Observer the story is 'total BS from Ukrainian yellow press'. 

The open discussion about Putin's sperm is out of the ordinary. The Kremlin usually gives nothing away about the president's private life.

Putin also becomes prickly when asked about his family. 

Putin's two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, and their private lives are protected by a strictly obeyed code of silence among Russia's media.

There is also ongoing speculation about Putin's relationship with Alina Kabayeva, 30, who was first named as the president’s mistress five years ago.

Putin divorced his wife, Lyudmila, 55, earlier this year. 

Ms Mizoulina is infamous for her strange law-making suggestions.

She recently recommended that all Russian Jews consider leaving the country, stating: 'We have enough problems'. 

Earlier this year, she also introduced a bill that banned higher education for young women who had yet to give birth.

She also drafted a law prohibiting 'sexual intercourse in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.' The law was not adopted.
