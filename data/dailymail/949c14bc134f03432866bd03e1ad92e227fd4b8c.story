National treasure Cheryl Cole regularly tops polls for her million dollar smile, glossy locks and style credentials, so it come as no surprise that the average 20-something female wants to look just like her.

Experts who studied the biggest fashion icons for women in Britain today found former X-Factor judge Cheryl still blazes the trail for the younger generation.

Regular style chart-topper the Duchess of Cambridge emerged as the most copied figure for women in their 30s, while former Friends actress Jennifer Aniston topped the list for the 40-somethings.

Daybreak host Lorraine Kelly came top of the pile for women in their 50s while Helen Mirren was the style icon for women in their 60s.

But Breakfast at Tiffany's star Audrey Hepburn was hailed as the overall style icon by women of all ages, followed by Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly.

The study, which involved women aged 
between 20 and 69, found younger girls also look up to Harry Potter star
Emma Watson and Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis.

Singer Pixie Lott also made the list as did The Saturday's star Frankie Sandford.

In
the 30-somethings category, the former Kate Middleton was slightly ahead of This 
Morning presenter and Celebrity Juice panelist Holly Willoughby, with model Kelly Brook in third and Victoria Beckham in fourth.

In
the 40s category Davina McCall was hailed as the second most popular 
fashion icon followed by author JK Rowling and Kylie Minogue in equal 
third.

Britain's
over 50s apparently aspire to dress like Lorraine Kelly, Nigella Lawson
and Carol Vorderman, while the 60-somethings prefer to dress like Dame 
Mirren, another Dame, Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley.

The
study found that 15 per cent of the women studied said they often 
dressed like their favourite celebrity and more than a quarter have 
tried to find out where a piece of clothing was from after they had 
spotted a celeb wearing it.

Three
quarters trawl the internet to find out where celebs clothes are from 
but one in twenty have even called into the TV show the star has appeared on in
a bid to track down the item.

A spokeswoman for clothing brand CC, which commissioned the report, said: 'It's only natural that different age groups favour and emulate different celebrities.

'But the research does throw up some interesting points - it seems being more style focused becomes more important with age.

'Women such as Lulu, Twiggy and Jane Seymour have retained they style icon status throughout the decades and become even more stylish as they get older.

'Stylish women in their 50's seem to opt for a more demure style as sported by the likes of Lorraine Kelly or Nigella Lawson in contrast to someone like Madonna who has always pushed boundaries in terms of her image and styling.'
