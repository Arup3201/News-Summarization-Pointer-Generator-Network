Gus Poyet says any North-East football fan should buy a ticket for the Stadium of Light to see Steven Gerrard in action for the last time.

The Liverpool skipper will play his final game in the region on Saturday lunchtime having confirmed his move to the MLS and LA Galaxy earlier this week.

Poyet played against Gerrard during his time with Chelsea and Spurs, and holds the former England captain in the highest regard.

‘If I was a football fan, I'd go to the Stadium of Light. I'd go just to see him,’ said the Sunderland head coach. 

‘He's the kind of player where it's worth paying the price of a ticket just to watch him. 

‘When he came on at Anfield against us, the first thing he did was to switch play with a ball from the outside of his foot. That alone was worth a ticket because I don't think too many players could do that.

‘He's that type of player. Fans in the North-East might not be able to see that again, so this is a great opportunity.

‘Realistically, I'd prefer him not to play but as a football fan I always want the best players to play.

‘But we're going to miss him, we'll just have to go to the States to watch him now.’ Poyet, though, feels that some of the criticism aimed at Gerrard – namely his failure to win a Premier League title – is unfair.

‘It's typical of football, we only concentrate on the bad things,’ he said. 

‘He won the Champions League, he won the UEFA and FA Cup. He won the lot pretty much, so why are we going to focus only on the one thing missing? That's football. They were close last year and I'm sure that was terrible for him because that's the closest you can get.’

Poyet admits the Mackems are still working hard to recruit players during this January transfer window
