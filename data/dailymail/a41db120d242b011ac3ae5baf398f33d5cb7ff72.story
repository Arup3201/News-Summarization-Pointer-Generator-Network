Dean Martin, whose bakery in Kew, west London, is the only one in the world to produce custard tarts to the original 500-year-old recipe that Anne Boleyn was eating when she first met Henry VIII 

The history of England could have been very different - but for one little Tudor tart.

As the intrigue and machinations of the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book Wolf Hall grip the nation, a baker has revealed it was Henry VIII's desire for a custard tart that brought him and Anne Boleyn together.

And it's a taste we can still have today, as a London baker makes the same pastries from the 500-year-old recipe that captivated the king all those centuries ago.

The second episode of Wolf Hall is due to be screened tonight, with much of the episode focusing on the drama behind the Henry's bid to replace his queen Catherine of Aragon with his new love Anne Boleyn.

Much has been made of the power of Anne's feminine wiles and how they drove the king to distraction.   

But a London bakery is now claiming that it was not Anne Boleyn's flat-chested charms that seduced the gluttonous king, but the 'delicious' Maids of Honour tarts she was devouring with her fellow ladies-in-waiting when the ill-fated couple first met.

Dean Martin's bakery, Newens Tea House in Kew, west London is the only one in the world to produce the tarts to the original 500-year-old recipe. 

He said: 'When Henry VIII first set eyes on Anne, she was with other maids of honour eating these tarts, that were cooling from the oven on a sliver tray.

'The story goes he was so enchanted by the little tarts they were eating that he ordered the cook who made them to come and work for the Royal Palace exclusively and locked the recipe away so only he and his court could enjoy them.

'It is interesting to wonder whether the king would have fallen in love with Anne Boleyn if she had not been eating the tarts when he first met her. Maybe the course of English history would have been very different without the Maid of Honour tart.'

Mr Martin said the recipe for the tart was kept exclusively by the palace until the 1700s when it was leaked by the palace cook to John Billet, a baker in nearby Richmond, west London, who began producing the delicacies for wealthy customers.

By 1850, John Newens, a former apprentice at Billet's bakery, had opened his own baking business, bringing with him the secret recipe he had been taught.

The original Maids of Honour recipe was passed down through the generations of the Newens family, who sold the bakery, and the secret recipe, to Mr Martin, 44, five years ago.

He said: 'This tart resembles Spanish and Portuguese custard tarts but tastes very different. It has a sweet, unctuous curd cheese filling inside a crisp butter pastry. It's a very comforting, English taste.

'They are best enjoyed cooling from the oven as Henry VIII ate them.'

Mr Martin, who bought the business from the Newens family five years ago, said the bakery had seen a 'spike' in demand for the delicacy since the first episode of the  £7 million Machiavellian blockbuster TV series starring Damien Lewis and Mark Rylance on BBC2 last week.

He added: 'We're already doubling our production of Maids of Honour tarts because we're expecting a big rise in visitors after the success of Wolf Hall.

'We are posting them out to people who cannot make it to Richmond but who would still like to sample them.'

The Maids of Honour tart recipe remained a Court secret for 200 years until it was leaked by a palace cook to a John Billet, a baker in nearby Richmond, west London, in the mid-18th century, who then began producing the delicacies for wealthy customers.

By 1850, John Newens, a former apprentice Billet's bakery, had opened his own baking business, bringing with him the secret recipe he had been taught. 

The original Maids of Honour recipe was passed down through the generations and the Maids of Honour tarts continue to be baked by Newens at their Kew tea shop to this day.

The tarts have been deemed so intrinsic to the shaping of Tudor history that they even made it on to the menu of original Tudor dishes as part of Hampton Court's celebrations for the palace's 500th anniversary events this Easter.

Newens has already enjoyed a taste of fame when TV chef Jamie Oliver visited the Kew bakery last year as part of his Channel 4 Friday Night Feasts series, to see if modern methods could improve the 500-year-old recipe - the verdict was he couldn't. 

The bakery counts current royals, ex-prime ministers including Winston Churchill and even Hollywood greats such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie among its more recent fans. 

Mr Martin said: 'We enjoyed a taste of fame last year when Jamie Oliver came to our bakery and tried to better the Maids of Honour recipe, and could not.

'However, apart from the fame these tarts give us, we're very much a local bakery manned seven days a week by local people who provide baked goods to the local community.'

Booker Prize winning Wolf Hall, and its sequel Bringing up the Bodies, charts the rise of Thomas Cromwell from blacksmith's son and former mercenary to one of the King's most senior and trusted advisors.

The tea house is now bracing itself for a spike in visitors following the success of Wolf Hall. 

Mr Martin said: 'We're already doubling our production of Maids of Honour because we're expecting a big rise in visitors after the success of Wolf Hall.

'Ours are the original Maids of Honour tarts, baked using the exact recipe that drew Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn 500 years ago and we're honoured to be a part of an iconic relationship that changed the course of English history.'

The bakery has just opened its first franchise 6,000 miles away in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to target the booming market for traditional English products in south east Asia.

It was the first time in 500 years that the Maids of Honour tarts had been baked outside the UK.
