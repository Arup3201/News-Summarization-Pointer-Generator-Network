A cancer survivor is pledging to run a 10k race in honour of a terminally ill teenager who has already raised £2.6million for charity.

Hannah Merridale, 29, had the middle and lower lobe of her right lung removed after she developed a carcinoid tumour.

But after hearing about the plight of Stephen Sutton, Ms Merridale from Isleworth, West London has decided to dust off her running shoes and enter the 10k Clapham Race for Life next month.

Stephen, who believes he has just days left to live, told the world he was on the brink of death after suffering from bowel cancer.

He set himself a ‘bucket list’ of 46 challenges to tick off in his final days, including a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd.

Stephen managed to tick off  33 goals, the first of which was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

But his plight captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and other internet updates that he used the growing goodwill to continue fundraising and he has now raised £2.6million.

Ms Merridale, a post production media supervisor at BSkyB, said: 'One of the things on his bucket list is to inspire someone to raise money for charity and I am going to do just that.

'I shall be running for Stephen. I have done some half marathons and 5K runs in the 10 years since my operation but I did think I had retired from running. I am confident I'll be able to do it - I'll walk if I have to.

'I hope that Stephen raises £10 million.'

Last night it was revealed that the 19-year-old had smashed his fund-raising target for the cancer charity thanks to donations being made at a rate of more than £400,000 a day.

It prompted him to gather the strength to write a Facebook message from his hospital bed.

He said: ' ‘Hi guys, it’s Stephen here again, and it feels so good to be able to put that. Currently I am feeling well and would describe my current situation as stable.

‘Different people will put my recent physical improvement down to different reasons; I don’t want to over dramatise things too much, but I do just want to mention that everyone’s positive thoughts and support has been hugely appreciated, so thank you for that.

‘The tumours in my body are still rife and dangerous, but I feel so lucky to just still be here, and in fact I feel completely privileged to be in this position where I can help make such a difference to other people’s lives.

‘The main thing I’ve always felt passionately about is helping others... I’ve always been a firm believer that people are “good”, and to see people come together for the cause recently in the way they have is incredibly touching and heartwarming.

‘Thank you from me, and also thank you from every young cancer patient in the future who will benefit invaluably from the money raised!’
