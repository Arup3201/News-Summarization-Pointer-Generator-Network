The grandson of famous soprano and radio star Queenie Ashton has revealed how his 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed in Phuket, Thailand with bedsheets and left in pain for hours during a nightmare ordeal.

The unorthodox restraints were used on expat Anthony Lawson after he tried to seek help when his requests for a drink of water, an IV change and prescribed sleeping pills allegedly went unanswered for three hours.

Mr Lawson, who was born in Sydney in 1935, but lived in England and Hong Kong before retiring in Thailand in 1998, was allegedly neglected and mistreated after being admitted to Phuket's main government hospital.

The award-winning commercial film and video director, who once voiced a range of Cathay Pacific airline commercials amongst others and also lent his voice to Star TV in Hong Kong, later died from stage four colon cancer on January 8 while still reeling from the traumatic experience.

Expat Anthony Lawson suffered a traumatic experience after he was admitted to Vachira Hospital in Phuket, Thailand, his son Ashton says

The 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed with these green spare sheets after he tried to walk out of his ward to seek help 

His 23-year-old son Ashton told Daily Mail Australia: 'My dad honestly believed that the increasing back pain he was experiencing was because of the incident at the Vachira Hospital that night.'

'Even right at the end, when he seemingly wasn’t consciously there, the one thing that was still always on his mind - and that’s what got at me the worst - he was still thinking about that night.'

Ashton reported his father's complaint of alleged mistreatment at Vachira Phuket Hospital to Phuket City Police Station on November 27, 2014. However, it is not being investigated by police because they claim there is a lack of evidence and perhaps Mr Lawson was a danger to himself.

The detailed complaint paints a traumatic picture of Mr Lawson's brief stay at Vachira after he was transferred from Mission Hospital on November 18, 2014, with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation.

Following instructions from his doctors to drink a lot of water because he'd been given a contrast medium to make his lungs stand out on x-rays, Mr Lawson called out for a drink after he was allegedly given no attention for three hours since his son Ashton had left the hospital at 6pm.

'Dad said “it’s been a long day”, he said “why don’t you go home and come back tomorrow”. We felt uncomfortable but I made it clear to the staff - and I’m not a fluent Thai speaker but I speak well - I said to the staff, and I know they understood me, that if there are issues I live three minutes down the road and you have my number on record,' Ashton explained.

It emerged the father-of-three's requests for water, sleeping pills and for someone to change his IV drip reportedly went unanswered for hours on end.

At 9:30pm, Mr Lawson climbed out of his bed and walked to the nurses' station where he was allegedly ignored by a male nurse on duty.

According to his complaint to police, Mr Lawson then tried to walk out of the ward to find help elsewhere but was stopped by the male nurse and three security guards who took him back to his bed.

The male nurse then allegedly tied him to the bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort.

'Dad's energy levels weren't high. The nurse seemed to already have prepared the bed sheets, he found himself being bound to the bed by bed sheets.

'So he’s tied up, he’s shouting out for more help despite the fact that the ones that are meant to help him are the ones that did it. The main concern is the water and he wants IV changed,' Ashton said.

In his complaint, Mr Lawson reports suffering an agonising back spasm while trying to free himself. It was not until 11:30pm that he claims he was finally given water by the male nurse.

However, because his arms were tied the nurse allegedly force-fed Mr Lawson causing him to choke.

'He held the jug above my father's head and started pouring. The water was hot - not too hot that it might burn him - but the guy just kept pouring with no attempt to give him sips. Dad had to actually turn his head to stop it.'

An attempt to escape the restraints saw Mr Lawson get as far as the car park at around 7:30am the next morning before he was hauled back to his bed.

Mr Lawson's son Ashton then found him in distress after a different nurse began their shift and agreed to call to ask him to come to the hospital.

'Next thing in the morning, I wake up to a phone call at 9am - it’s my dad saying “they tied me up to the bed, get over here”,' Ashton said.

'I was bloody shocked and I rode over there, and there he is lying in bed, slightly upright and I looked down on the bed and there were indeed some knots tied into extra sheets. There were two either side for the arms and one bed sheet at the end used to hold his feet down.'

Ashton spoke to his father's doctor about what happened. 'He was quite shocked but not shocked enough. He had a look in his eye and even later on said "honestly I shouldn't say this but this hospital has too many patients and not enough staff to take care of them",' Ashton recalled.

Ashton then reportedly met Vachira Hospital’s Deputy Director Somnuek Jirayuth, International Department head nurse Ms Methavee and two other nurses on January 29 where any wrongdoing was denied.

Anthony Lawson spent one night at Vachira Phuket Hospital last year when the incident is alleged to have occurred 

When Mr Lawson died in January he was still upset about what had allegedly happened to him at the hospital

Mr Lawson complained that a male nurse tied him to a bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort

But Ms Methavee admitted that Mr Lawson had been restrained.

The hospital claimed they tried to call Ashton, but he says he received no calls from them that night.

'I find the hospital's explanation and reasoning behind what happened to be flimsy at best,' Ashton told the Phuket Gazette, the local paper which first reported Mr. Lawson's ordeal.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Vachira Hospital for comment. 

Ashton admits he is 'angry' about what happened to his father. Mr Lawson believed the back pain he suffered in his last months was caused by the hospital experience, but Ashton concedes it was likely caused by the colon cancer that was already spread around his body.

'It was just sad because what if that night didn't happen? The pain would have manifested anyway and maybe the first hospital would have done more tests and found the cancer - he still would have been stage four and he still would have died, but we could have informed more family and they would have had more time to visit him,' Ashton said.

It was a humiliating experience for a man who had spent the later years of his life fighting perceived injustices, with video documentaries on his own YouTube channel.

Mr Lawson's own father was Lionel Lawson, a celebrated violinist and leader of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

His mother Ethel, who went by the stage name Queenie Ashton, was well-known for her role as Granny Bishop in the Australian radio serial Blue Hills which aired from 1949-76.

Mr Lawson followed his parents into the entertainment business and became a highly-regarded radio editor in Australia before moving overseas to pursue his film career.
