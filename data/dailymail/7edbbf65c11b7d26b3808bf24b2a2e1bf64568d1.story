Ballet prodigy Sergei Polunin has turned up in Moscow after vanishing just days before his new show was set for its UK premiere.

There were fears after the 23-year-old Ukrainian, dubbed the bad boy of ballet, stopped showing up for rehearsals for the UK premiere of Midnight Express a week before the show was to start.

The show's director, Peter Schaufuss, had expressed concern for the star, who is well known for his party lifestyle.

It was the second vanishing act by Polunin, who dramatically quit Britain's Royal Ballet in January last year just a week before he was due to dance in The Dream.

After the Ukrainian dancer failed to show up for rehearsals last week his hotel room was searched but he had vanished.

It was even feared he might have been involved in an accident.

But a spokesman for the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, where Polunin now dances, said yesterday that the star was fine and back in Moscow.

The reason for his sudden departure from remains unknown, but there have been claims that he left because he didn't like Mr Schaufuss's production of Midnight Express.

The heavily tattooed Polunin is a 
rising star in the ballet world, joining the Royal Ballet at the age of 
13 and at 21, becoming the youngest dancer to be made a principal.

After
quitting the Royal Ballet last year, he told reporters that he found 
rehearsing "very boring" and wanted to give up ballet by the age of 26 
as it was so gruelling.

But 
he returned to the stage quickly, performing with Moscow's Stanislavsky 
Ballet and making guest appearances with the Royal Ballet.

His lead role in Midnight Express, which had its preview performance last night at the London Coliseum, was taken by understudy Johan Christensen, who had been in rehearsals with Polunin.

The ballet, that Schaufuss first choreographed in 2000, is based on the 1977 memoir by Billy Hayes about being jailed in Turkey for drug smuggling.

The book was also made into a film which won a Best Writing Academy Award for Oliver Stone.
