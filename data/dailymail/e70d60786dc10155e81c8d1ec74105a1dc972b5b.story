An Oklahoma City man arrived home to find a broken package from Amazon and surveillance footage that explained the damaged goods: the USPS delivery woman chucked it over a fence and onto his porch.

Pedro Gonzales was shocked as he watched on his home CCTV the unfamiliar postal worker pull up beside him home, leave her truck and then fling the bulky manila envelope onto his porch.

'I’ve never seen this person before, but usually we get pretty good service,' he told KOCO.

No respect: This Oklahoma City postal worker was caught on a home's cameras tossing a valuable package over a fence and onto the homeowner's porch

Damaged: The package at center right was damaged went it hit the porch, says homeowner Pedro Gonzales

U.S. Postal Service officials were informed of the matter and, after a brief investigation, discovered the offending postwoman.

Unfortunately for Gonzales and his Oklahoma City community, Postal Service rules don't allow them to release the name of the offender.

They can't even say whether or not she was punished. 

 'Seeing someone just toss it like that really gets on my nerves,' Gonzales fumed.

All the Postal Service has done is assure community members that steps have been taken to ensure they will receive the best mail delivery possible.

'We take great pride in delivering the mail to the American public, that’s what we do. We do it every day.,' said a USPS spokesperson. 

Two USPS representatives also visited the Gonzales home to apologize.

What's more, Amazon has offered Gonzales a 20 percent discount for his negative experience. 

'Seeing someone just toss it like that really gets on my nerves,' Gonzales fumed

USPS rules do not allow them to name the woman or say whether she's been punished, but officials there have said she's been identified internally

US Postal Service rules preclude them from identifying the employee or even saying whether or not she was punished
