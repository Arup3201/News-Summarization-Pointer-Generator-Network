Liam Gallagher was named yesterday as the rock star allegedly being sued for millions for fathering a love child.

The former Oasis frontman faces claims from music journalist Liza Ghorbani, 39, who says she gave birth to his baby, a girl, according to reports in the US.

Miss Ghorbani, who was named by the New York Post and New York Daily News, interviewed Gallagher for a column called ‘A Night Out With...’ in which reporters spend the evening with a celebrity.

Allegations: Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher (pictured with his wife Nicole Appleton) faces claims from music journalist Liza Ghorbani (right) who says she gave birth to his baby, a girl, according to reports in the U.S.

In the article, published in 2010, Gallagher and Ghorbani went to New York’s Ritz-Carlton bar and a private club.

She has now hired ‘the best divorce lawyer in New York’ to handle her claim.

Newspapers reported earlier this week 
that a British rock star was seeking to keep a US love child secret over
fears that his wife would leave him. The reports, which did not name 
the singer, said the child’s mother was demanding £2million from him as 
well as child support.

Millionaire Gallagher, 40, is married 
to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton. There was no public reaction from 
Miss Appleton, his second wife, while Gallagher’s spokesman refused to 
comment on ‘gossip’.

He added that ‘legal action’ was being taken against the New York Post, which named Gallagher as the father of the love child.

Gallagher has instructed London law 
firm Harbottle & Lewis. They sent warning letters to newspapers 
making inquiries about the singer’s reaction to the claims.

Gallagher fathered a child as a result of an affair during his first marriage.

A couple of months after he married 
actress Patsy Kensit in April 1997, he had a fling with singer Lisa 
Moorish, who gave birth to Molly, now 15, the following year.

He and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in September 1999 and divorced a year later.

Gallagher had a son Gene, now 12, in 
July 2001 with Miss Appleton. The couple, who married in 2008, were 
believed to be in Ibiza yesterday as the love-child allegations emerged.

Miss Ghorbani is said to claim that she gave birth to his daughter less than a year ago.

After learning she was pregnant, she 
is believed to have contacted the star, who denied the child could be 
his and broke off contact, before instructing lawyers.

The New York Post said she was suing 
him in the Manhattan Family Court for £2million, in a case listed as 
‘Anonymous vs Anonymous’.

It is alleged she is willing to take DNA tests to prove her case and wants Gallagher to pay paternity costs.

A friend of the mother said: ‘She has no doubt in her mind he is the dad.

‘She knows who she slept with and when. She isn’t some tart, she’s a successful professional.’

The lawyer representing Miss Ghorbnai 
is Bill Beslow, whose previous clients include Robert DeNiro, Nicole 
Kidman when she divorced Tom Cruise, and Mia Farrow in her child custody
suit against Woody Allen.

Mr Beslow told the Daily Mail: ‘I am representing the mother.’ But he said he would not identify her.

Another top Manhattan divorce lawyer, Raoul Felder, is representing Gallagher. He declined to comment.

A court hearing took place last 
Friday, and another is set for later this month, according to the New 
York Post, which claimed ‘multiple sources’ had named Gallagher in 
connection with the paternity suit.

Last night the singer’s spokesman said: ‘Lawyers are taking action against the New York Post.

‘We are not going to comment on gossip.’

Gallagher, who now fronts the band Beady Eye, was yesterday performing at the Ibiza Rocks festival.

A housekeeper at the star’s 
£2.7million five-bedroom townhouse on the edge of Hampstead Heath, North
London, said the whole family had ‘gone away’.

The singer once said he wanted  to 
move his entire family to New York as soon as his children have finished
school, and last year bought a £1.6million apartment near Central Park.

Gallagher was raised in a council 
house in Burnage, Manchester, by his mother Peggy after his abusive 
father left. He has a famously frosty relationship with his brother and 
former Oasis bandmate Noel.
