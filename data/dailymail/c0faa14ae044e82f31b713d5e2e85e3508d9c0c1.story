Danny Cipriani and a host of talented youngsters are fighting an uphill battle for England recognition at clubs deemed unfashionable in the lower half of the Aviva Premiership, according to Mark Cueto.

The veteran wing, who was part of the team which reached the World Cup final in 2007, believes his Sale team-mate and some rising stars at the club, along with others outside the title-chasing elite, struggle to force their way into Test contention.

Earlier this month, Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards suggested his in-form No 8 Mark Wilson would be playing international rugby by now if he were at a more ‘fashionable’ club.

Cueto said: ‘Dean’s right. Naturally, if you are in a team which is winning more games than it is losing, then your job is a bit easier. You can generally put in better performances week after week, so naturally the teams at the top of the league attract more interest from England coaches.

‘Last year, there were rumours that James Gaskell and Rob Miller were told that moving to a more southern club would enhance their chances with England. I hope that isn’t the case because it would be absolutely horrific for a coach to say that.’

Cipriani has been left out of the latest England squad despite his stellar form this season and Cueto added: ‘Cips is a classic example. If he were at one of the top few clubs, no doubt there’s a lot more chance that he would be involved.

‘But regardless of how a club are performing, if a player is putting in outstanding performances every week, he’s got to be looked at, whether he’s playing at the top or the bottom of the league.

‘If anything, putting those performances in for a bottom-half-of-the-table team means he deserves a chance more than if he was at a top team.

‘There are a lot of things Cipriani can do which other 10s can’t, and he can do it when he’s on the back foot. He came away from that New Zealand tour last year with credit in the bank, but he still hasn’t been given a chance.’

Cipriani is waiting to discover if he will be in the revised England squad announced next Wednesday, as he weighs up whether to sign a new deal with Sale or explore the option of a move to Toulon. ‘The decision I make will not be based purely on England selection,’ he told BT Sport. ‘It’s a difficult decision that I have to make in the next couple of weeks.’

Sale have a number of promising rookies emerging this season, particularly teenage full back Mike Haley, wing Will Addison and No 8 Josh Beaumont. Cueto hopes this trio and others can go on to earn England call-ups and fulfil their potential, without having to move elsewhere.

‘Hopefully we can keep them and they can be the heart and soul of the club for years to come,’ he said. ‘But if players don’t feel the club are really investing and showing ambition, then they’re not going to stay around. Guys don’t just want to play for England, they want to be in the play-offs and win trophies.’

That is certainly the case for Newcastle’s England prop, Kieran Brookes, who has agreed to join champions Northampton in the summer. The Falcons are angry that the 24-year-old tighthead showed no desire even to consider staying at Kingston Park, where his career was resurrected following an ill-fated stint at Leicester. 

Richards said: ‘We’re obviously disappointed to see Kieran head to Northampton, as we would have liked him to stay here, at the club that has helped him to develop into the full England international he is today.’

London Irish confirmed that director of rugby Brian Smith has left his post and the Exiles are poised to announce Waikato Chiefs coach Tom Coventry as his successor.

Saracens lock George Kruis is available for the start of England’s Six Nations campaign after receiving a three-week ban for a tip tackle on Gloucester wing David Halaifonua last Friday. Gloucester have signed All Blacks lock Jeremy Thrush. The 29-year-old will arrive after the World Cup.
