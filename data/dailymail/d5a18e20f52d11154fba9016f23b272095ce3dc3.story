Companies were yesterday urged to ‘hire a hoodie’ in an attempt to get more young Britons off the dole queue.

Employment Minister Chris Grayling called on bosses to give local youths a chance instead of hiring experienced Eastern Europeans.

He claimed that despite their lack of experience, ‘surly young men can turn into excited and motivated employees’.

The minister spoke on the day figures revealed that unemployment had 
fallen slightly across the country. But many of the new jobs are being 
taken by migrants.

The figures also showed that record numbers of men are being forced to 
accept part-time work because they can’t find full-time jobs.

Mr Grayling said it was ‘easy’ for companies to hire Eastern Europeans, 
who tended to be older and more experienced than many Britons seeking 
work.

Speaking to the Policy Exchange think-tank in London, he said: ‘But 
those who look closer to home can find gems too.

Falling: The number of people out of work dropped by 35,000 in the last quarter - yet the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance actually increased

Often the surly young 
man in a hoodie who turns up looking unwilling to work can turn into an 
exciting and motivated employee.

‘It’s all about the explanations that they have, and the place they come
from.

And employers who give them that chance find it enormously 
rewarding.

‘So I stand foursquare behind my hope that British employers will put local recruits first.’

In a wide-ranging speech on employment issues, Mr Grayling - whose 
comments echoed David Cameron’s call for people to ‘hug a hoodie’ while 
in Opposition - also criticised companies who set up call centres 
abroad, calling them ‘mad’.

He said: ‘We all know how frustrating it can 
be speaking to a call centre operator overseas who works from a set 
script, but doesn’t get what your problem is.’

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, also revealed that
the number of full-time workers actually fell 27,000 to 21.2million, 
showing how the unemployment drop is being fuelled by the ballooning 
‘Part-Time Britain’ trend.

There were 80,000 more part-time workers between December and February, taking the total to 7.9million.

Of those, the ONS figures revealed that 1.4million have only taken 
part-time work after failing to get a full-time job - with the most 
dramatic increase in this category among men.

The army of men working part-time following a fruitless search for 
full-time employment has increased to 626,000, the largest number since 
records began 20 years ago. It has more than doubled since the credit 
crunch struck in 2007, and there are fears it will keep on climbing.

John Philpott, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 
said: ‘For these men, it is a choice between a part-time job and being 
unemployed.’

Jobs crisis: There will be almost one million people who are 'long-term unemployed' by the end of the year

Almost a million people will have been out of work for more than a year by the end of 2012, according to new research.

The IPPR think tank said another 107,000 people will join the ranks of the long-term unemployed in the coming months, taking the total to its highest level since 1995.

The report, said long-term unemployment was the 'hidden crisis' facing the UK economy.

Tony Dolphin, the IPPR's chief economist, said: 'Long-term unemployment is the hidden crisis of the slowest ever economic recovery in the UK.

'While the youth contract is designed to help young people out of work for more than a year, the Work Programme has only been able to secure employment for about a third of jobseekers on the programme.

'On current progress, just two-thirds of people out of work for a year will not get work in the following two years. Government policy is not keeping pace with joblessness.

'Unemployment is not going to fall until the middle of 2013 and the number of people out of work for more than a year is going to grow to almost a million the end of this year. The longer someone is unemployed, the less likely they are to ever return to work.

'The government should guarantee everyone who has been unemployed for more than a year a job at the minimum wage in local government or the voluntary sector. But with that right should come the responsibility to take that job or risk losing their benefits.'

The reports follow news that almost 500 jobs are under threat after supermarket milk supplier Dairy Crest announced plans to close two dairies.

The proposed closures involve a glass bottling dairy at Aintree, where 220 people work, and a site at Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire employing 250 people.

The Unite union described it as 'devastating news.'

Aquascutum, the 160-year-old British clothing retailer which has dressed Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother, collapsed into administration yesterday, jeopardising 250 jobs.

The business was bought by Jaeger's owner Harold Tillman and its chief executive Belinda Earl in 2009 but it continued to make 'significant losses' despite their efforts to turn it around, according to administrators at FRP Advisory.
