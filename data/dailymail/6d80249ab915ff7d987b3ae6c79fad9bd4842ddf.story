Qantas is going ahead with plans to dump more than half of its life rafts from Boeing 737 planes to save money on fuel consumption. 

The airline, which will start making the changes this week, says 'it is about being smarter' and has denied the move will make the planes less safer. 

Half the planes in the 72 batch fleet will have the life rafts removed. 

They are flights which do not fly over long stretches of water and only go between Australian capital cities.

Qantas fitted all their Boeing 737 with life rafts in the nineties but are now removing the rafts from the half the fleet which don't travel over water 

Sharna Rhys-Jones, a spokesman for Qantas, explained that the airline had life rafts fitted to all the 737's in the 1990's to avoid the time and difficulty for engineers involved in loading rafts on and off planes.

Before that the life rafts were put in manually depending on whether the planes were flying over water or not. 

She said the new approach was 'about being smarter' and it would help save money on fuel consumption as the planes would be lighter. 

Mike Plottel, Qantas’ Head of Safety, explained the planes that don't fly over water don't need the rafts 

Mike Plottel, Qantas’ Head of Safety, said: 'The majority of our Boeing 737s operate between Australian mainland cities and don’t fly over long stretches of water, so rafts simply aren’t required even as a precaution.

'This approach is the midpoint between two policies we’ve had in the past, which saw us taking rafts on and off as needed or keeping them on every aircraft no matter where it was flying. 

'Our 737s that fly over long stretches of water will continue to be fitted with life rafts – for example Trans-Tasman flights that go to New Zealand. 

'The simple rule of thumb is that all Qantas aircraft that need to carry life rafts, which is all of our international aircraft and about half of our B737s, will have them onboard.' 

'We would never implement any change that would compromise CASA’s and Qantas’ strict safety standards.' 

The move, which applies to planes that travel less than 400 nautical miles out to sea, has attracted criticism from ­independent senator Nick Xenophon and some Qantas pilots and crew. 

Qantas says the new move is about maintaining a 'high level of safety while being smarter' 

Senator Xenophon called for the airline to abandon the plan after hearing safety concerns from staff that people could die of hypothermia if a plane went down over water within the limit, reported The Australian. 

Mr Plottel added: 'This is about us maintaining Qantas’ high level of safety while being smarter with the way we operate our flights. 

'In the past we installed life rafts on all our B737’s, even if they didn’t operate over water. 

'Now, we are separating them into two categories –ones that fly over water and ones that don’t – and allocating them appropriately.' 

Similar plans are being implemented by competitor Virgin Australia and six Jetstar A321 aircraft. 

CASA said the Qantas decision was in accordance with international rules incorporated into Australia’s air-safety regulations.

A spokesman told The Australian “These international stand­ards permit flights out to 400 nautical miles or 120 minutes’ flight time, whichever is less, from land without the carriage of life rafts for certain aircraft.'
