Hundreds of excited  shoppers poured through the doors of Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall today.

The store launched at midday with a promise to bring cosmetics prices down for Australians, but a price comparison reveals customers will pay the same money for top brands as they do in Myer and David Jones.

Sephora will introduce 32 new brands to Australia, some of which will be sold in line with prices in its European and U.S. stores, but the outlet has no plans to undercut any products already being sold locally.

Crazed fans rushed through the doors when the makeup shop officially opened at midday on Friday

The new brands include the store's own affordable makeup range, Formula X, Marc Jacobs, Ole Henriksen, Tarte, Kat Von D, Hello Kitty and SKIN INC.

Sydney store director Danielle Hill said the prices in Australia would be as close to U.S. prices as possible.

'Some things are closer to the American range but not all,' Ms Hill told Daily Mail Australia.

But brands including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome and Clarins that are already sold locally  will not be sold for cheaper.

Daily Mail Australia compared prices on products from top labels including Dior, Lancome, Shiseido, and Clinique and found no difference between Sephora Australia, Myer and David Jones.

Dior Capture Totale 60mL face cream costs $255, Lancome Blanc Expert 50mL night cream costs $129, Shiseido Benefiance Concentrated Neck Contour Treatment 50mL costs $70 and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion 125mL pump costs $49 across all three stores.

Sephora U.S.: $US26 (A$31.06) 

The same products are sold to U.S. customers at lower prices and with free shipping on the Sephora website.

The Dior cream costs $US160 ($A191.08), the Shiseido product costs $US52.50 ($A62.72) and the Clinique lotion costs Clinique $US26 (A$31.06).

Price hikes on cosmetics have long been a sore point for local shoppers, with consumer group Choice finding that Australians pay up to 50 percent more than shoppers overseas for some products. 

Ms Hill said Sephora charged the same prices as other stores in Australia due to agreements with brands already available here.

'It's more of a category question where they just have a relationship the brands and the agreement that we have with them,' she said.

'We've got the Sephora collection which is our brand and we can control a little bit more.'

The cosmetic superstore has proven irresistible to many Australian shoppers, with many camping in wild storms overnight just to be one of the first customers to walk through the door.

When the clock hit midday on Friday, a confetti cannon went off to signify the store's open and shoppers filled the make-up giant's newest store, screaming and snapping selfies at the mirrors.

Ms Hill said she had launched five stores in the U.S. but had never seen such a big turnout.

'This is the first time I've seen people camping out, which is so amazing and rewarding,' Ms Hill said.

Rebecca Johnston, 17, from Menai, skipped school to be among the first customers. 

'Because it's Sephora, it's my life, like I cried when I walked in the store,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Many of the people were in line to be one of the first 300 to buy a product from reality TV star Kat Von D's range, so they can meet her at the store tomorrow.

Troy Kellahan, 26, flew to Sydney from Brisbane for the opening. He has an image of Kat Von D tattooed on his calf. 

'I'll probably faint when I meet her, she's an inspiration,' Mr Kellahan said.

Ali Caley, 27, from Croydon stood in line from 4am to buy makeup so she can meet Kat Von D.

'I just think she's got so much confidence, doesn't give a damn what everyone else thinks about her,' Ms Caley said. 

Security guard Kuki Tomruk said the queue of 1000 people before the opening was 'crazier than a nightclub'. 

Longs lines are expected for days, if not weeks, because security will limit shoppers to 200 at a time.

Kirra Jackson, 19, from Collaroy camped at the front of the line from midday on Thursday. 

She shielded herself from last night's storm using a tent and cardboard given to her by Westfield management.

'We're a little bit crazy, we like makeup just a little bit too much,' she told Daily Mail Australia, adding that she planned to buy as much as she could when she got in the doors. 

Ravi Thakran, Asia and Middle East president of Sephora's parent company LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, said the company would keep its promise of maintaining low prices on its exclusive brands, the Australian Financial Review reported.

But Mr Thakran added: 'If a brand is already in the market we don't tell them to give us a cheaper price (and) we don't want to compete with department stores and other players based on lower pricing.' 

He said the retailer planned to open 20 stores across Australia, first focussing on launching an extra store in Sydney and two in Melbourne.

Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said Australians pay much more than shoppers in the U.S. and UK, whether its for cosmetics or digital content.

'If the retail outlets in Australia don't start to offer competitive prices consumers will be driven online,' Mr Godfrey said.

'People are going to continue to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to navigate around geoblocks and access a better deal.'

VPNs disguise a person's IP address on their computer so they don't appear to be shopping from Australia, and can get the same cheaper prices as U.S. shoppers.
