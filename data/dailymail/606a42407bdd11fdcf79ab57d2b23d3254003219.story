Ian Poulter expressed one final thought before leaving the Association of Golf Writers’ dinner at Royal Liverpool on Tuesday night. ‘I’ve got a good feeling about this one,’ he said.

Good feelings abound at the start of the 143rd Open Championship. There is hardly a big name in the sport who is not coming here feeling good about his game. After a slow start to the season, the stars are all flexing their muscles.

Rory McIlroy won in England in May. Justin Rose has won his last two events. Martin Kaymer was a classy winner of both the US Open and the Players’ Championship.

Walking tall: Justin Rose goes into The Open in great form having won his last two tournaments

Adam Scott has reached the summit of the game, Graeme McDowell has triumphed in Versailles while defending champion Phil Mickelson looked like he made a breakthrough with his putting last week.

There is no sport like this one for upsetting the odds but it will be a surprise if this major does not run close to form.

This edition is due to begin with a blessed day, and every competitor will be looking to make a first-round statement given a forecast of virtually unbroken sunshine and a gentle breeze.

Nobody could quibble with the number of hours the BBC are showing but some spectacular rounds might be heading for home by the time they come on air at 9am.

Starting proceedings: Swedish golfer Robert Karlsson will get The Open underway with David Howell

David Howell and Robert Karlsson, for instance, are in the first group out at 6.30am. Two years after pulling out of The Open with a sad case of the yips, Karlsson is more than capable of posting a score that could stand all day, as is fellow nice guy Howell.

‘No problem for me getting up at that hour raring to go,’ said Englishman Howell, the father of seven-month-old twins. ‘Getting up at 5am is a lie-in for me.’

Tiger Woods, his playing partner Henrik Stenson, and McIlroy are off shortly after the television coverage begins and will inevitably carry much of the early interest. Given the forecast, it will be something of a surprise if McIlroy does not add to his impressive list of low first-round scores.

As for Woods, who knows what might happen. Would anyone be shocked if he shot 68 or 78? The suspense simply adds to the anticipation.

Eyes on the prize: Rory McIlroy will tee off with Tiger Woods and Henrik Stenson on Thursday morning

Woods has not won a major for more than six years but the 14-time champion remains on pace, nonetheless, to catch Jack Nicklaus’s total of 18 majors. The Golden Bear also had 14 at the age of 38 and won his 15th at his 66th attempt.

This is 38-year-old Woods’s 65th major, and he will play his next two on courses where he has won. Yes, it remains close.

And then there is Rose. It is 45 years since an Englishman won on English soil, when Tony Jacklin unleashed his ‘corking’ drive of legend down the 18th hole at Royal Lytham.

Jacko is here this week, and the 70-year-old is as keen as anyone for the long wait to end. ‘Given the form he is in and the fact he’s a proven major winner, you’d have to think Justin has a great chance,’ he said.

Yet has he
 peaked too early, with his win in Washington and sumptuous illustration
 of links play at Royal Aberdeen last week? Rose has certainly got the 
right attitude.

‘If
 I hadn’t won last week I think this event would be a realistic 
opportunity for me to win, so I don’t see how it is less realistic 
because I did win,’ he said. ‘The goal for me is to trust my game, and 
give myself that opportunity.’

Sure thing: Rose says he trusts his game following successive Tour victories ahead of The Open

How poetic if he were to prevail here, on the same stretch of English coastline where he emerged, with his stunning performance in finishing tied fourth as a 17-year-old amateur at Birkdale. Three wins in a row sounds such a tall order but maybe, just maybe, the 33-year-old is about to complete an unforgettable milestone for British golf.

The last time The Open was played at Hoylake it was won by the world No 1, and what a contrast he makes with the current holder. When Woods turned up on Sunday, 3,000 people showed up to follow him around. Out on the links, Scott was an almost solitary figure.

Under the radar - as much as any man can be occupying top spot - is how Scott likes it but nobody is fooled. He is the favourite on merit. Two years ago Scott led at Lytham by four shots with four holes to play but still lost to Ernie Els.

‘It might not have been the finish I wanted but I left knowing I had the skillset to win an Open,’ said the gentle Aussie. ‘I had a chance to win last year as well and it makes you hungrier than ever to get the job done.

‘I am playing some of the best golf of my career so I should be taking advantage and giving myself a good chance.’

Scott has been here for a week already, developing a familiarity with the course under different breezes. ‘I just enjoy coming early, it’s one of my favourite tournaments,’ he said.

‘Last week I got to play an Open Championship course when it was closed to everyone else. It’s a real perk of the job.’

Born a fortnight apart in 1980, Rose and Scott will surely add to their total of one major apiece in the future. ‘This is our time,’ is the mantra that binds these great friends tight.

Here at Hoylake, in the form of their lives, there is no time like the next four days.
