Having got shot of one undeniably talented but possibly unhinged centre forward, Liverpool are now close to recruiting another who offers even greater chance of fireworks. Quite literally.

Mario Balotelli’s return to the Premier League is on the cards, with Brendan Rodgers seemingly changing his mind over the former Manchester City striker who brought drama by the rocket load during his previous spell in England.

But is the only player in world football with more baggage than Luis Suarez really what Liverpool need?

Suarez ultimately left Anfield without too much hand-wringing because of his tendency for chowing down on opponents and ambivalence towards racial slurs (as well as a £75million fee from Barcelona).

While at City, Balotelli set off fireworks in his bathroom to accidentally start a fire that caused £200,000 worth of damage, threw darts at a youth team player for fun, and staged a mock sword-fight with a friend using a rolling pin during a late-night meal at a curry house that broke team curfew.

His time in Manchester came to an acrimonious end as he threatened to take the club to a Premier League tribunal over their £340,000 fine issued for his extensive periods banned following red cards.

In his last full season at City he missed 11 of 54 matches in all competitions through suspensions, including three Champions League games for a kung-fu kick on Dynamo Kiev’s Goran Popv.

Do Liverpool really need another player with a proclivity for enforced absences as a result of on-field indiscretions?

Their bid to take Balotelli initially on loan did include the potential for a ‘good behaviour’ clause, allowing a termination of the deal if the 24-year-old decided to strap a Catherine Wheel to a Yorkshire terrier – or some other such jolly.

But that was slapped down by AC Milan and a permanent transfer worth some £16million has instead been accepted.

The appeal for Rodgers is based on Balotelli’s ability with the ball and experience of the English top-flight and Europe’s elite competition. 

He is a beguiling presence, as his goal against England at the World Cup illustrated, and remarkably cool from 12 yards, missing not a single spot-kick at City. Steven Gerrard step aside.

He scored 20 Premier League goals in 33 starts for City (21 appearances came from the bench) and has 26 Serie A goals in 43 games for AC.

But, simply, the Italian does not occupy the same plane as his Uruguayan counterpart, which you imagine would need to be the case given his magnetism to mayhem.

Suarez scored 31 goals in 33 Premier League games and linked up beautifully with Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling. Before he bit Giorgio Chiellini those factors balanced out the bother.

Bother is guaranteed with Balotelli, but is the rest? Ostensibly, he is a good guy with a wayward mind who will perform outrageous acts on the spur of the moment. But Rodgers will have to work hard to ensure the potential for unrest among the squad is worthwhile.

Pictures would regularly surface of Balotelli going tete-a-tete with Roberto Mancini at training. Not an unfamiliar occurrence in general at clubs but the frequency clearly tired his manager, who had to intervene after one particularly ugly tackle by Balotelli on Scott Sinclair.

Rodgers does not seem wholly convinced. He privately expressed reservations about the Italy striker's mentality and character during the club’s United States tour this month, saying: ‘I was asked the question about Balotelli last week and spoke about what a talent he is and excellent player he is. But I can categorically tell you that he will not be coming to Liverpool.’

Radamel Falcao, Samuel Eto’o, Loic Remy and Wilfried Bony have all been looked at but failed to materialize for various reasons so it seems Balotelli is a late – if not last – resort.

With a player like him doubt can create cracks, and cracks produce ructions. Ructions are good for newspapers, but not exactly productive for a team embarking on their most important season in years.
