The multimillion dollar war over Snapchat (logo pictured) has taken an ugly turn after the ousted co-founder was hit with a restraining order

The multimillion dollar war over Snapchat has taken an unexpected twist after an alleged co-founder was hit with a restraining order for leaking documents to the press.

Frank Reginald Brown was ordered by two of his former friends, who founded the photo sharing app, to cease and desist from making any more information public.

The order states that more leaks would cause ‘irreparable injury to Snapchat’ and that the information is ‘highly confidential’.

Mr Brown immediately signalled that he would ignore the order as he wages a public relations campaign to win the case.

A judge will now have to decide if the order is granted, even though Mr Brown is supposedly planning an interview with GQ magazine in which he will almost certainly keep up the pressure on Snapchat.

The restraining order was filed as part of an increasingly bitter court battle between Mr Brown, Snapchat’s chief executive Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who also set the firm up.

Mr Brown sued because he claims they stole the idea for Snapchat from him when they were students at Stanford University.

While California-based Snapchat has no sales or business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly instant service, instead of a more permanent record collector like Twitter or Facebook.

Snapchat recently turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, despite making no income from normal business.

Evan Spiegel, one co-founders of the two-year-old social media company has reportedly turned down the huge all-cash offer, which would have valued Snapchat at $4 billion – but the firm is said to be being wooed by other investors and possible buyers.

Sources close to the company told The Wall Street Journal that Mr Spiegel, who dropped out of Stanford University, is hoping for a better offer.

According to sources, he thinks the app’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago, the company’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day, from 200 million in June.

However, the company does not disclose its numbers and has not commented on the rumours.

Observers have said that the case has 
echoes of the lawsuit brought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss against 
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ended with a $65 million 
settlement.

Since its creation, Snapchat has become so successful that it recently rejected a $3 billion buyout deal from Facebook.

The order was filed after Mr Brown leaked
 an embarrassing video deposition to Business Insider, in which Mr Spiegel 
admitted that Mr Brown ‘may deserve something’ for his contributions to the development of the app.

Among
 the other information Snapchat is concerned about going public is 
sensitive personal information about its bosses and sensitive financial 
information about the company.

Both sides must submit such data as part of the court process known as 'discovery' - and they have to show it to the other party too.

The order, known as a 'protective order', would cover almost everything involved in the case, effectively ensuring a blackout.

Spiegel and Murphy also filed a preliminary injunction request which could mean Mr Brown is subject to fines, contempt of court or dismissal of the case entirely if he breaches it.

Snapchat is one of the most popular photo sharing apps in the world, especially among young people. According to research by Pew Internet, 26 per cent of under 30s use it, though the number of over 30s was tiny

Mr Brown alleges that Mr Spiegel and Mr Murphy 
turned against him by changing the passwords on the Snapchat servers to 
shut him out when the company was in its infancy.

Mr Brown now wants one-third of Snapchat even though he previously agreed to 20 per cent, his lawsuit states. Currently he owns nothing.

Snapchat is one of the most popular photo sharing apps in the world, especially among young people.

According to research by Pew Internet, 26 per cent of under 30s use it, though the number of over 30s was tiny.

In November it reported that users sent 400 million messages every day - more than Facebook and Instagram's messaging service combined.
