The morning after the night before: Prince Harry heads for home yesterday after spending the night in Fulham

After four and a half months in Afghanistan he must have a lot of catching up to do.

No surprise, then, that Prince Harry spent his first weekend of freedom after returning to the UK enjoying himself overnight with pals.

The third in line to the throne joined a gang of friends in Fulham, south-west London, for a spirited ‘welcome home’ bash.

Earlier on Saturday night the prince and his friends were apparently seen in the Brown Cow pub in Fulham Road.

The group were described by onlookers as ‘lively’.

Then, around 9pm, Harry was spotted at the entrance to Sainsbury’s supermarket in Fulham Broadway.

Although he had a baseball cap pulled down low over his head, he was instantly recognised by other shoppers who Tweeted news of the sighting.

One, LondonBallerina, jokingly referred to herself as the ‘Sainsbury’s Cinderella’, and said: ‘I was exiting Sainsbury’s in Fulham Broadway & casually bumped into Prince Harry. I’m sure there was a spark . . . Eye contact and everything! . . . move over Will & Kate!!’

Several hours later his Scotland Yard police protection team were seen at a house in the vicinity.

Harry, still wearing his baseball cap, low-slung jeans and a checked shirt with the sleeves rolled up, did not leave until 10.30 yesterday morning.

Looking slightly weary, but otherwise remarkably unscathed, the prince walked to a waiting car being driven by his detectives and was presumably taken back to his flat at Kensington Palace.

There was no sign of Harry’s rumoured girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, a blonde student and socialite he dated before he left for the front line.

Sources
insist, however, that the two did keep in touch while he was serving as
an Apache attack helicopter co-pilot and gunner, and that the prince 
has been keen to rekindle his relationship with Cressida, daughter of 
Sixties It-Girl Lady Mary Gaye Curzon.

Although he is one of the world’s most eligible bachelors, in an interview to mark his return Harry bemoaned the fact that girls are put off by his position, rather than attracted by it, saying: ‘You ain’t ever going to find someone who’s going to jump into the position that it would hold. Simple as that.’

Harry, who arrived back in Britain last 
Monday, is now set to enjoy around four weeks leave before returning to 
duty at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk and undertaking royal duties again.

The prince is said to have excelled himself on service in Afghanistan but caused something of a storm on his return with the interview in which he openly admitted killing members of the Taliban.

He was also unrepentant about his antics in Las Vegas last summer, when he was photographed frolicking naked with a woman in his hotel suite during a game of ‘strip billiards’.

Harry admitted that he may have let 
his family down but insisted that the pictures should not have been made
public as it was a ‘private occasion’.

He said: ‘My father’s always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that.

‘But
it’s very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the Army. 
Everyone’s wearing the same  uniform and doing the same kind of thing.

‘I
have always said work hard, play hard. I will always be enjoying the 
job... however long it may carry on for, and then I have the other job 
to fall back on.

‘It was probably a classic case of me being probably being too much Army and not enough prince.’
