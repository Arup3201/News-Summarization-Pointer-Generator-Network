A ‘shanty town ’ occupied by around 50 European migrants is to be cleared on the orders of the High Court.

The area of shacks and tents in woodland on the Lee Valley Park in North London was highlighted by the Daily Mail earlier this week.

High Court officials yesterday granted landowners Transport for London immediate possession of the site which has been occupied by Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian economic migrants for a year.

A group of around 50 migrants from Eastern Europe have set up a 'shanty town' in some woodland on the banks of a canal in London

The area of woodland, next to a busy roundabout in Edmonton, has been turned into a semi-permanent residence consisting of around 15 huts

Solicitor David Linklater, representing TfL, argued that the rights of the landowners to possession outweighed any breach of human rights to private life the migrants, who were illegal trespassers, might claim. 

The hearing was told the fire brigade was concerned that the camp in Edmonton next to the North Circular Road had become a fire hazard.

There were also a number of gas canisters being used for heating and cooking which could cause an explosion.

The site, where more than 15 shacks have been built from discarded timber, doors, pallets and plastic sheeting for multiple occupants, was ‘filthy’, added Mr Linklater.

None of the occupants – many of whom work as ‘cash in hand’ painters and builders – attended the High Court hearing and the order was therefore not opposed.

Earlier this week, the Daily Mail was invited to tour the site by 30-year-old Roma gipsy Marian Dumitrache, who revealed how up to six migrants sleep in a room on bare mattresses and sit outside among makeshift tables, armchairs and abandoned shopping trolleys.

Mr Dumitrache left his native Romania six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city of Buzau. 

Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp.

‘No one likes the Roma gipsy. Living here is cold and uncomfortable but at least I can earn money painting and send that home.

‘But we are not living off other people or the state. The camp is deserted today because people are at work.’

He added: ‘We cook on camp fires and some people use the canal to wash. We are not really living here – we just about exist. It is very cold at night. We have no gas or electricity.’ 

TfL plans to ask the occupants to move voluntarily but if this does not happen it is likely the area will be cleared by the middle of next week.
