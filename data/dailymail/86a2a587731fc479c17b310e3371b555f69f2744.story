Rock-solid Chelsea have picked up where they left off last season and have now kept eight clean sheets in their past nine home League games. 

In a sterile first half, the loudest cheer was for the homecoming hero warming up. Didier Drogba had only to emerge from the technical area to galvanise Stamford Bridge.

Frankly, in a poor opening 45 minutes, there was precious little else about which to get excited.

When Drogba finally received the call to make his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since leaving in 2012 — by which time Chelsea were 2-0 up — the excitement was near feverish. Even Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wore a broad smile and applauded enthusiastically.

Coming good: Jose Mourinho had to have some sharp words with his striker in the first half, but it paid off

However, the question remains whether the return of Drogba at 36 years of age amounts to a glorified testimonial year or a viable alternative for manager Jose Mourinho.

It is probably a bit of both. That said, given the paucity of world-class strikers, and the reality that a really good player will not come to sit on the bench, then there is some sense behind the decision.

Drogba’s physicality and know-how are bound to carry Chelsea through a few tricky moments and in the first half against Leicester he may well have led the line better than Diego Costa.

Mourinho has warm words for the Brazilian-born Costa, who speaks no English but seems to communicate with everyone just by charisma. He has also scored two goals in as many games, when it took Fernando Torres 24 to reach that total.

Costa also felt the sharp end of Mourinho’s tongue during the first half, presumably for not offering enough movement. 

Drogba might have handled a side like Leicester better, but the trouble is it would be a risk to start with the Ivorian knowing that he probably only has an hour of good football in him. That means Chelsea are likely to resist any offer for Torres, at least until they have a replacement.

Return of the king: Didier Drogba was given a hero's welcome when he came on with the game won

Mourinho is genuine when he says he needs his No 3 striker — though his failure to even win a place on the bench indicates just where he ranks.

Chelsea look to have finally solved their striker problem, with Diego Costa netting twice already this season and 36-year-old Didier Drogba providing solid back-up. 

Fernando Torres, though, who didn’t make the squad against Leicester, will not be allowed to leave the club, despite being linked with a move to Italy.

‘I want three strikers in the team,’ manager Jose Mourinho said. ‘I cannot do a season without three strikers. 

He (Torres) will play and score goals. He is a fantastic guy, a fantastic professional, so there is no problem.’

Drogba’s role will surely be principally as a substitute but any injury to Costa would surely mean Torres would start, especially when the two-games-a-week schedule kicks in.

‘This (situation) is over next week,’ Mourinho said. ‘After that we have Capital One Cup and Champions League. Everything is much easier then because all will be playing.’

The striking options Chelsea have at their disposal this season do seem a considerable step up from what they had last term.

Ultimately though, it stills looks short of the talent champions Manchester City can draw upon — assuming they all stay fit, of course.

Long term, even the euphoria surrounding Drogba’s return will not help Chelsea bridge that gap.
