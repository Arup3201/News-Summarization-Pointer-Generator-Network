Refusal: Sergio Marchionne, Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, said the company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. Chrysler is refusing to recall 3million models deemed unsafe by a government agency

Car manufacturer Chrysler has refused to recall 3million vehicles after US government safety tests concluded there was a risk in certain models of deadly fuel tank fires.

The problem, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) relates to the position of the fuel tank being close to the rear meaning collisions are more likely to cause fires.

To date an estimated 51 people have died in car crashes that resulted in fires in Chrysler sport utility models, according to ABC News.

After its own analyses, the NHTSA asked the company to voluntarily recall Jeep Grand Cherokees from 1993 to 2004 and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007.

But in a rare move, the car manufacturer is refusing to cooperate.

In a statement on its website, Chrysler said it 'does not agree with NHTSA’s conclusions and does not intend to recall the vehicles cited in the investigation'.

'The subject vehicles are safe and are not defective,' the statement said, adding its vehicles 'met and exceeded all applicable requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,' including tests pertaining to fuel-system integrity.

The agency said in a letter to Chrysler, dated Monday, that the placement of the fuel tanks behind the rear axle, coupled with their height above the road, was a design defect.

The NHTSA's analysis found that the Jeeps' fuel tanks can be hazardous when hit from the rear and leak fuel. They can cause fires if there's an ignition source, it said.

Chrysler moved the fuel tanks on the Grand Cherokee ahead of the rear axle in 2005, and did the same thing with the Liberty in 2007.

Chrysler's own analysis, from over 30 years of data, found the fire incidents which are the focus of this request, occur less than once for every million years of vehicle operation.

This is comparable to other vehicles produced and sold at the time, the company said.

Not being recalled: Jeep Grand Cherokees from 1993 to 2004 (Jeep Grand Cherokee 1999 pictured) and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007 are both advised for recall, amounting to 1million vehicles

The car firm has been working with the NHTSA, sharing its data with the agency, on this issue since 2010, at the request of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group.

'We believe NHTSA’s initial conclusions are based on an incomplete analysis of the underlying data, and we are committed to continue working with the agency to resolve this disagreement,' the statement said.

Sergio Marchionne, Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, added: 'The safety of drivers and passengers has long been the first priority for Chrysler brands and that commitment remains steadfast.

'The company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. All of us remain committed to continue working with NHTSA to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles.'

While the NHTSA can order a recall, it will have to obtain a court order to enforce it, according to ABC News.

Can makers usually agree to recalls, mainly to protect their public image. In the last three years, Chrysler has conducted 52 recalls.
