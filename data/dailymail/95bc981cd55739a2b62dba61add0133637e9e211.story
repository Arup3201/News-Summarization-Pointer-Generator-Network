The daughter of convicted killer Bevan Meninga helped free her father from jail with a heartfelt letter that pleads: 'I know he is a good man', it has been reported.

The murderer brother of rugby league legend Mal Meninga was released on Wednesday morning after serving almost 23 years behind bars for the death of Sunshine Coast teenager Cheree Richardson in 1991.

His 15-year-old daughter, who was conceived during an affair he had with a prison guard, was instrumental in securing his release from his life sentence, The Sunday Mail reports.

Touching: This heartfelt letter from convicted killer Bevan Errol Meninga's daughter reportedly helped secure his release from jail

'My Daddy is Bevan Errol Meninga and I believe in him,' it says.

She explains how 'all of his family love him dearly, especially me' and claims the pair have a strong relationship.

The touching note reads: 'He is my dad and I love him so so much. He is my life. My life without him is harder than ever, he loves us with all his heart.'

She asks for the authorities to 'think really hard' about how happy their family will be to have him released.

She also promises that his family will look after him, a sentence that was echoed by rugby league legend Mal Meninga on Wednesday.

Murderer Bevan Meninga was released from Palen Creek Correctional Centre in Rathdowney

He said his family will do everything they can to put his brother Bevan on the right track after he served out his sentence for the murder of Ms Richardson.

The 42-year-old killer was eligible for parole in 2005 but was kept in custody on a low-security prison farm, Palen Creek Correctional Centre, at Rathdowney.

'We're very pleased this day's come,' Mal Meninga told reporters.

'Obviously we don't condone his actions but we understand that he's very remorseful towards the family of the victim.

'As a family, all we can do is support him. All we can do is be around and make sure he's well looked after and make sure he's doing all the right things. We'll stick by him.

'He's very disorientated at the moment. It's a surreal experience for him.'

Bevan Meninga, who was released just after 5am on Wednesday, was 20 when he was sentenced to life in prison for attacking 19-year-old Cheree Richardson in 1991. He was locked up on May 24, 1991.

Brother's joy: Mal Meninga said he is 'very pleased' his brother was released from jail

Authorities approved his parole application after his mother moved to Brisbane from the Sunshine Coast to provide him with a place to live, reported the Courier Mail.

Mal Meninga said his mother was excited to have her son back at home.

'She's also very mindful of the fact that he has committed an awful crime, mindful of the fact that he's under strict guidelines from a parole point of view and mindful of the fact that we've got to make sure that Bevan's in a position to make a worthwhile contribution to society,' Mal Meninga said.

'It's a difficult time for everybody. Not only us but the victim's family as well.

'I know that there's an element out there in society probably wishes Bevan would stay in jail for the rest of his life.'

The condition of his parole states that he cannot live on the Sunshine Coast where Cheree's family still resides

He will also undergo regular drug and alcohol tests after booze was found to be a factor in his brutal attack on 19-year-old Cheree, who was repeatedly hit with a tree branch.

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said he hoped Bevan Meninga's family and friends would support him in his rehabilitation.

'He certainly has done the crime and done the time,' he said.

The murder left the Sunshine Coast community in shock and despair when the teenager's lacerated body was discovered in an Alexandra Headland park.

Meninga was arrested days later, after being found hiding in the ceiling cavity of a flat.

At the time, he was also on parole for bashing a woman with a stake in her home.

Meninga was sentenced to life in jail in August 1992 for the murder and in 2000 he fathered a child with a prison guard.

A friend of Cheree's parents said John and Helen Richardson had left town for a while to escape the coverage on Meninga's release.

Mal Meninga previously supported Bevan's parole application and even offered to take him in at his Brisbane abode.
