Sarah Palin could be set to lose both her marriage and her political career after the release of the  explosive biography on the Tea Party darling.

The National Enquirer claims that friends close to the politician and her husband Todd say he is 'fed up' with the constant scandals that 
have plagued their marriage ever since she ran for vice president and is ready to file for a divorce.

As well as kissing goodbye to her
 marriage, it has also been alleged that her advisers have told her to 
kiss goodbye to the White House fearing a bid would be 'political 
suicide'.

In The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin, the 47-year-old is accused of having a night of passion with a basketball star, snorting cocaine and having an affair with her husband's business partner - all allegations which are thought to have shattered Palin's White House dream.

Moving on: Todd Palin is allegedly fed up with the scandals surrounding his wife Sarah Palin and is said to be filing for divorce

Anchor: Sarah Palin in 1987, when she presented a sports show on local TV and met basketball star Glen Rice, who she is alleged to have spent the night with

A source close to the former vice 
presidential candidate said: 'Sarah Palin has been destroyed by Joe 
McGinniss' no-holds-barred biography. It exposed all her lies, cover-ups
 and secrets.

'As a result she has been told by her
 advisers that it would be political suicide to announce a White House 
candidacy. The press and her opponents would have a field day digging 
into the dirty details of her background.'

Brother: Chuck 'Chuckie' Heath Jr told friends that Todd and Sarah 'didn't have a marriage'

The bombshell book is said to have 
put the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, after Sarah's brother 
Chuckie was quoted saying his sister and Todd's marriage was over.

A friend told the National Enquirer: 
'The final straw was McGinniss quoting Sarah's brother Chuckie telling a
 friend they don't have a marriage.

'Todd felt as if he was stabbed in 
the back by his own brother-in-law after 23 years of being married to 
the guy's sister, and having five kids together.'

It was revealed last week that former
 basketball player Glen Rice had a one-time fling with the Alaska 
governor when she was a news anchor for her local station and he was a 
junior at the University of Michigan.

The source told the Enquirer that 
Todd feels like he's been made a laughing stock as the hook up had 
become a joke on late night TV and was all over the internet.

He was also said to be 'fuming' over 
the biography's confirmation that his wife had an affair with his 
business partner Brad Hanson and that Todd dissolved their snowmobile 
dealership after learning of it.

Though both parties denied it at the 
time it came to light in October 2008, Palin's ex brother-in-law Mike 
Wooten allegedly confirmed it saying: 'Todd and Sarah were headed for 
divorce, but Sarah got pregnant soon after, so they decided to stay 
together.'

The new book also claims that Palin snortedcocaine off a 55-gallon oil drum and separately smoked marijuana in secret liaisons
 with one of her college professors.

The book's author Joe McGinniss moved in next door to the Palins in Alaska to dig dirt 
for his salacious biography. 

In
 response, Todd Palin slammed the author as a 'stalker' who has a 
'creepy obsession' with his wife after details of what was in the book 
were first leaked.

He said: 'This is a man who has been relentlessly stalking my family to the point of moving in right next door to us to harass us and spy on us to satisfy his creepy obsession with my wife.

His book is full of disgusting lies, innuendo, and smears. Even The New York Times called this book "dated, petty," and that it "chases caustic, unsubstantiated gossip".

Mrs Palin, meanwhile, has been careful to avoid commenting.

Explosive: The book, written by Joe McGinness, right, is said to have put an end to her White House bid

The author writes that after college Mrs Palin developed a 'fetish' for black men.

She allegedly had a tryst with 
basketball star Glen Rice in her younger sister Molly's University of 
Alaska dorm room, while she was dating Todd and just nine months before 
the couple were married.

Mrs Palin got pregnant with Todd and they eloped in August 1988.

Their son Track, the oldest of five, was born eight months later in April 1989.

A
 friend said Mrs Palin spent the night with the basketball star but 
could not confirm whether they had sex, according to the National 
Enquirer.

'I remember Sarah feeling pretty good that she'd been with a black basketball star,' a source told the magazine.

The athlete is said to have confirmed the night of passion in Mr McGinniss's book.

Mr Rice went on to have a huge career playing basketball in the NBA and was a three-timer All-Star.

Heat: The book alleges that Palin had a one night stand with basketball star Glen Rice

The 
explosive book goes on to quote those who knew the family growing up, 
claiming Mrs Palin was a 'bad mum' who would lock herself in her room 
for hours on end asking not to be disturbed while her children cooked 
themselves dinner.

Sarah Palin was plucked from obscurity to be the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008.

The 'pitbull in lipstick' sparked a media storm after accepting the nomination, despite questions over her experience.

But she wowed the U.S. after a 
barn-storming speech in September 2008 in which she attacked critics for
 calling her 'small town'.

Six months: Palin is said to have had an affair with Brad Hanson, one of her husband's colleagues

A former mayor of Wasilla before she 
became governor of Alaska, Palin stepped down after the Republican 
defeat in the presidential election.

The
 mother-of-five has remained tight-lipped on whether she would stand 
next year, but said she would likely make an announcement at the end of 
this month.

She has been overshadowed in recent months by Tea Party candidates including Michelle Bachmann.

The
 Republican, who has now associated herself with the Tea Party movement 
in the U.S., has been dogged by scandal since being selected as Senator 
John McCain's running mate in 2007.

There have also been frequent rumours that she is set to divorce her husband Todd, which have always been denied.

And she has faced accusations by the 
father of her daughter's child, Levi Johnston, that she wanted to keep 
Bristol's pregnancy a secret and adopt the child herself.

Palin has yet to declare whether she intends to run for election in next year's presidential race.

Joe McGinniss, 68, has written several political books including works on former president Richard Nixon and on Alaska.
