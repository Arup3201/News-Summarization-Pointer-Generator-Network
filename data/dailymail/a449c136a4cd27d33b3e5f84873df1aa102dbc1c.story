Controversial: Experts have warned thousands of women to stop using the NuvaRing, pictured

A British woman has been stricken with potentially deadly blood clots after being put on a controversial new contraceptive that allegedly killed a 24-year-old US law student last year.

Thousands of UK patients are being warned to stop using NuvaRing by experts who have told The Mail on Sunday it puts women at a far higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than traditional forms of birth control.

Marketed by pharmaceutical giant Merck, the device is available free on the NHS.

In addition, this newspaper has learned that women whose doctors may have qualms about prescribing it can buy it on the internet after a cursory online medical ‘consultation’.

The vaginal contraceptive ring  is impregnated with a cocktail of hormones, released for a month after it is inserted, making it seem an appealing alternative to the Pill. Some 9,000 British women have used it since its approval by UK regulators  in 2008.

But a 44-year-old English mother-of-one has consulted lawyers about massive blood clots on her lungs which she claims developed after she was prescribed the device.

Claire Tellis-Doherty, head of a medical negligence team compiling a database about the drug’s alleged dangers, said the woman – identified only as Lorraine –  was fit and healthy before being put on the ring.

‘In 2012 she began to feel constantly tired,’ Ms Tellis-Doherty said. ‘She visited her GP on three occasions but was told nothing was wrong.

But by 2013, she couldn’t walk without being breathless. After she was admitted to hospital, it was discovered she had massive blood clots covering around 40 per cent of both her lungs.’

Lorraine survived the crisis but was allegedly left with low blood pressure that ‘potentially shortened’ life expectancy.

Tragic: Erika Langhart, 24, died after suffering two heart attacks allegedly caused by using the Nuvaring contraceptive

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has disclosed that it has received 23 reports of ‘spontaneous suspected adverse drug reactions’ relating to NuvaRing, some involving blood clots.

In the US, where NuvaRing has been available since 2002, over 3,500 lawsuits have been filed claiming the device has caused serious health problems, culminating in the death last year of 24-year-old law student Erika Langhart, after two heart attacks allegedly caused by the ring.

Dr Michael Carome, head of Washington-based Public Citizen Health Research Group, told this newspaper he believes statistics show the device should be banned. ‘As long as Nuva-Ring remains on the market, our advice to women is to avoid it,’ he said.

NuvaRing is available free from UK GPs and at family planning and sexual health clinics.

It is also sold on Internet sites including PharmaDoctor, which ‘approved’ a MoS reporter’s purchase after an online consultation, despite her saying she was obese – which significantly increases blood clot risks.

Merck insists ‘the safety and efficacy of NuvaRing were originally established in clinical trials involving more than 3,700 women.’ But the company website adds: ‘The risk of getting blood clots may be greater with the type of progestin in NuvaRing than with some other progestins in certain low-dose birth control pills.’
