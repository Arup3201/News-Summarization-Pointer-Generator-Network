Claims: Patrick McLoughlin, who commissioned the report

Ministers hired accountants to ‘dress up’ figures that would show the HS2 rail project providing a £15billion a year economic boost, it was claimed yesterday.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin commissioned a report by KPMG which said the £43billion scheme would rapidly ‘pay for itself’.

But critics of the plan said the 92-page document was a ‘paid-for analysis that gives the “right answer”.’

It was also described as a ‘desperate attempt to justify a seriously flawed project’, while the TaxPayers’ Alliance said Mr McLoughlin was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures based on ‘dodgy assumptions’.

Economic modellers at KPMG drew up their assessment on the high speed rail project at a cost of more than £240,000.

Mr McLoughlin said it provided the ‘hard evidence’ needed to convince sceptics.

The £15billion a year benefits cited in the report meant the £43billion line – plus £7billion for trains – will ‘pay for itself’ in just a few years, he added.

Speaking at the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, he shrugged off Treasury claims that the true cost would be £73billion, and dismissed other estimates of up to £100billion.

However, briefing notes prepared ahead of the report’s launch instructed its authors how best to respond to awkward questions including: ‘Have you fiddled the figures?’.

Richard Threlfall of KPMG insisted they had not been ‘fiddled’ to please their Government client.

Ministers and accountants at KPMG say their HS2 report looks only at the economic benefits of the high speed rail scheme - which they calculate to be £15billion a year by 2037  – not the costs .And they admit they took an ‘alternative’ approach to doing that calculation – which could be at odds with more ‘conventional’ ways of measuring economic benefits.Ministers say the conventional Whitehall analysis fails to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new KPMG study has addressed.Littered with complex mathematical formulae, the KPMG  report  explains its methodology by saying: ’The analysis focuses on the  potential impact of investment in HS2 on the structure of regional economies in the longer term.

‘It is therefore different from conventional approaches to  the appraisal of transport schemes, which are based on the  monetary value of time and cost changes.’The report stresses: ’It does not seek to value time and cost changes directly.‘Instead, it aims to understand how these changes to travel times and  costs influence regional economic performance, both in terms of overall economic productivity and the location of economic activity.’It says: ’The analysis provides an alternative approach to conventional transport appraisal, and the estimated net benefits should not be considered as comparable or additional to those estimated by  conventional  appraisal techniques.’But critics and campaigners say his is gobbledegook.

He said: ‘No, absolutely not. You would 
not expect a respected accountancy firm to put their reputation on the 
line by doing any such thing.’

He added that the report was ‘robust’, had been peer-reviewed by independent economists and would ‘withstand academic scrutiny’.

The analysis also ‘shows beyond reasonable doubt that HS2 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme’s cost’.

However, the Institute of Economic Affairs called the project ‘a high speed gravy train’, branding the accountants’ analysis ‘one-sided and unconvincing’.

Head of transport Dr Richard Wellings said: ‘Its conclusions are based on highly questionable assumptions.’

Standard cost-benefit analysis shows it to be ‘extremely poor value for money’, he added.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the report was ‘an expensive propaganda exercise’, adding: ‘The Government has squandered taxpayers’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many, many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money.’

The HS2 Action Alliance said the new report ‘stretches credibility’, did not use ‘mainstream’ methodology and ‘makes a host of other questionable assumptions’.

The protest group’s director Hilary Wharf said: ‘This latest report is a rabbit out of the hat.

But like all conjuring tricks it lacks real substance.

‘They have abandoned respected approaches and paid for an analysis that’s only virtue is it gives the “right answer”.’

The 351-mile project, which aims to link London to Birmingham and beyond by running 225mph trains through Tory heartlands in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire, is mired in controversy.

The Commons’ public accounts committee has already accused ministers of failing to make a ‘value for money’ case for the scheme.
