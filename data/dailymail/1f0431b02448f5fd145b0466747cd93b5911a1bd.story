The players on the tee this morning will be a bag of nerves. After playing nine holes on Thursday as part of the Pro-Celebrity Challenge, I can totally sympathise!

It might sound stupid, but teeing off on the first was as nerve-racking as when I made my England debut.

The adrenaline was incredible but I struggled to get the ball on the tee.

It was a privilege to be there and to play with Mark James against Ian Woosnam and Kenny Dalglish - one of my heroes and the man who signed me as a 17-year-old.

The course was in fantastic condition but, speaking from experience, the players will want to stay on the fairways - that rough is juicy!

It’s beautifully set up for the players but it is a fair course, so good shots will be rewarded.

The Scottish hospitality was fantastic and there was plenty of banter but in the end they were too strong - home advantage paid off for Kenny!

What a weekend we now have in store. Great golfing drama sprinkled with some Premier League derby action. It doesn’t get any better.
