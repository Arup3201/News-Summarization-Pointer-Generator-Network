Model Daisy Lowe has let her face become a canvas to promote WWF's global Earth Hour.

The 24 year old had her faced painted  with a flower blooming over her eye from cracked earth etched on her shoulder to pose for the striking picture taken by photographer Rankin.

The shoot was held to promote Earth Hour on Saturday, 23 March, when people around the world are encouraged to turn off their lights for one hour, to show they care about the future of our planet.

At 8.30pm landmarks, businesses and millions of homes across the globe will join in the switch off.

Daisy said: 'If we enjoy our planet then I believe we need to take care of it. I hope that people across the UK and the world will take a moment this Earth Hour to appreciate both the beauty and the fragility of the natural world that we rely on so much.'
