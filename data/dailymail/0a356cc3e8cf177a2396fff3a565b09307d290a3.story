Paul Gascoigne, pictured walking with a bottle of gin in Sandbanks, Dorset, last week, has been told by the landlord he must leave his penthouse apartment

Paul Gascoigne could be homeless in just 10 days after being told he must quit his £3million penthouse apartment.

The news comes after shocking images emerged of the former England player - once the country's most gifted midfielder - slumped with his head in hands, outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset.

A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours in the luxury apartment block, which overlooks Poole Harbour, is said to have led to the ultimatum.

The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' 

A friend however has reportedly said that the ex-footballer has been told to leave before the end date.

Gascoigne is believed to still be in Poole Hospital after he was taken their by medics 'for his own safety' on Thursday afternoon.

Pictures of him being led away by the emergency services released last week show the 47-year-old looking  almost unrecognisable from his playing days.

In the midst of his latest health scare, two builders have also described how they pulled the former Newcastle player from a bush following a suspected drinking session.

Dan Lawrence, 31, and his brother Ben, 29, helped Gascoigne up after they saw two legs 'sticking out of the bush' and found him rolling around and struggling to get up. 

The pair told The Sun that the footballer had a brief chat with them before 'stumbling off' towards his flat.

Two days later, he was in an ambulance on the way to hospital.  

He was also recently seen in public at a WH Smith store, where fans said he appeared 'unsteady on his feet'.

His sister Lindsay said on Facebook yesterday: ‘This illness is so tragic, and there is no cure, and [it] has shown its ugly head again. So in among my heartbreak . . . please leave us alone to grieve and pull together as a family as always to help save a great man.’ 

It had been claimed that Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side. 

Harry Redknapp, the manager of Queens Park Rangers, has offered trouble Gascoigne the chance to help out with coaching his young players at QPR as he voiced his concern for the former England midfielder's health.

The former Newcastle and Lazio player was taken to hospital 'for his own safety' after being found drinking on the street outside his home 

Since relocating to the south coast, Gascoigne now lives in close proximity to Redknapp, who revealed he would jump at the chance to give him a way back into the game.

'He is a great lad and it is just sad to see how he is looking at the moment,' he said.

'I saw him about a month ago and I said 'I will pick you up in the mornings Gazza, come training with me. Do a little bit of work with the kids.'

Gascoigne enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him represent the likes of Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers, whilst also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters. 

The ex-England midfielder has been plauged by alcohol and drug problems and was spotted with his head in his hands following a suspected drinking binge in Sandbanks, Dorset,  last week

The troubled 47-year-old moved to the luxury Dorset resort earlier this year, and has been renting the property which has a view over Poole Harbour

However he has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football a decade ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston United.

He was first sent to rehab by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson in 1998, having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. His life since has been an ongoing struggle with drink, drugs and mental health issues. 

In a TV documentary shown last September, the star described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

The ITV show Being Paul Gascoigne revealed he was addicted to sweets and spent £1,000 a year on anti-wrinkle jabs to counteract the ravages of drinking.

The star of the 1990 World Cup in Italy, whose teams included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough, spoke about overhearing doctors say he might die when he was being treated in the US.
