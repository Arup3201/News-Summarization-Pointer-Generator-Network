She was the woman whose own tragic childhood inspired her to create the world's most famous nanny.

And now PL Travers' dramatic life and her long feud with Walt Disney over Mary Poppins, the 1964 film that catapulted her character to worldwide stardom is set to hit the big screen.

Almost 50 years ago Walt Disney gave Julie Andrews her Hollywood debut as the magical nanny and Dick Van Dyke the chance to play one man band Bert, the Cockney with the questionable accent who befriends Poppins and the children in her care. 

But despite being one of the world's most loved movies Travers vowed never to work with Disney again because she was so appalled by it.

Dramatic: PL Travers, pictured, and her siblings were left destitute when her alcoholic father died, inspiring her to create Mary Poppins

She hated the script, in 
particular that it included the famous animated scenes and she considered that Andrews' Mary 
Poppins was too pretty.

Travers also disapproved of the film for ignoring
the harsher aspects of the nanny's character and did not like a 
lot of the music.

The new film Saving Mr Banks, starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, will centre around her dramatic journey to stardom and her lesser-known battle with icon Walt Disney.

Born Helen Lyndon Goff in 1899, she suffered an impoverished childhood, which inspired her magical stories and characters.

Her father was a banker who turned to alcohol, lost all his money and died young - it is widely considered that the character Mr Banks was based on him.

As a young woman she was an actress, dancer and a poet before concentrating on fiction.

Row: The 1964 movie is still loved all over the world but Travers never forgave Disney for what she thought was an appalling film

Anger: It was the animated scenes starring Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke that caused the author to cry throughout its premiere, which she had to sneak into

Ten years after leaving Australia for
Britain, with little money, her first Mary Poppins book was published 
in 1934 with huge success.

Under
her pen name PL Travers several other books were written but it was her
own personality and life that also fascinated people.

She never married and as a single mother adopted an Irish child at 40, Camillus, but she refused to take her child's twin too.

Meanwhile Walt Disney began a 14-year campaign to buy the rights to the Mary Poppins stories and make them into a film.

Disney knew her books and bombarded Travers with 'attention, flattery, transcontinental telegrams and visits'.

Success: Despite her tragic start in life Travers became an actress, pictured left in A Midsummer Night's Dream, and right in another play in her native Australia

Travers spent years rejecting attempts by Walt Disney
executives, who had spotted the film potential of the stories.

After
refusing offers from most US film studios she finally gave in to Walt 
Disney, accepting a $100,000 advance, around $2 million dollars today, 
as well as five per cent of the film's profits and the chance to approve
the script personally.

Bestseller: The author wrote eight books before she died aged 96, selling many copies across the world

But from there the relationship then turned sour.

She constantly contacted the studio throughout filming with objections and attacked its producers and director.

This culminated in her being 
stopped from attending the film's premiere, but she managed to sneak in 
and watched the film in floods of tears.

She then refused ever to work with Disney on any other project, preventing them doing a sequel to the much-loved film.

'Julie Andrews, a friend of mine, has all
the necessary integrity to play the part – she was just directed 
wrongly.' she said later.

'She was quite prepared to put on a 
black wig, with a knob of hair at the back, and a turned-up nose. She's a
great trooper and very honest. But to her surprise, as well as mine, 
Disney turned her into a very pretty girl, which really loses the 
point.'

Her experiences 
with Walt Disney were so bruising that when the stage version was first 
mooted she agreed on the proviso that 'no Americans' would be involved.

She died aged 96 still upset about what had happened.

The new film is expected to be released in 2014, fifty years after Mary Poppins hit the big screen.
