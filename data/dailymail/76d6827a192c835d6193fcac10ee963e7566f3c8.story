The barbed message for UEFA from Legia Warsaw fans was loud and clear on Thursday night as their team qualified for the group stages of the Europa League with a 2-0 victory over Kazakh side Aktobe. 

Unfurling a banner during Thursday night's win, the message from Warsaw fans read: 'Because football doesn't matter. Money does.'

Henning Berg's side were dumped out of the Champions League - following a 6-1 aggregate victory over Celtic earlier this month - after it was discovered Warsaw had fielded an ineligible player against the Scottish champions.

Now, having made their feelings known to Europe's football governing body, the Poles could be handed an explosive re-match with Celtic in Friday's group stage draw in Monaco. 

Celtic had been handed a reprieve but were again beaten in the Champions League qualifiers as they lost 2-1 on aggregate to Slovenian champions Maribor on Tuesday.

Having been refused a re-match, Warsaw took great delight in the Bhoys elimination and  mocked the Scottish club by tweeting: 'Football won'.

Legia Warsaw had initially decided to appeal against Uefa's decision but did not have any success - which prompted the club to take their case to The Court of Arbitration (CAS).

However their case was also rejected by the CAS which resulted in the club's apparent bitterness towards Celtic.
