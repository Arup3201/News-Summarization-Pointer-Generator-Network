Holland took part in their first training session in Brazil amid spectacular views of Rio de Janiero ahead of the 2014 World Cup.

Future Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal donned shorts in the hot and humid weather as he put his players through their paces at the Estadio Jose Bastos Padilha Gavea in Rio.

The training base is surrounded by lush mountains - while the famous Christ the Redeemer statue can be seen in the distance casting a watchful gaze over players including Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder.

Rockin' Robin: Holland captain Van Persie has declared himself 100 per cent fit for the tournament

Van Persie appeared sharp during the session as he put his injury problems behind him. The Holland captain has declared himself 100 per cent fit for the tournament, despite being withdrawn during the team's final warm up game against Wales.

The 30-year-old insists he has fully 
recovered from the knee injury which kept him out action for two months 
towards the end of the Premier League season.

'Against Wales, I stayed behind in the 
changing room for the second half just to be careful because the match 
against Spain is much more important,' he said of the opening game for 
the Dutch at the World Cup in Salvador on Friday - a repeat of the 2010 
final.

However, there was a slight injury concern over instrumental playmaker Wesley Sneijder who was forced to receive medical attention after picking up a knock during the training session (below).

The Galatasaray schemer eventually returned to his feet after a brief motivational talk with van Gaal.

Arjen Robben was seen enjoying himself while giving the South American ball boys a taste of his ball skills by engaging them in some keepy-uppy practice (above).

Van Gaal's training methods have been criticised by leading Dutch fitness coach Raymond Verheijen, who has worked at 
clubs across Europe. He believes that two training sessions 
per day have increased the risk of muscle injuries in the Holland squad.

Verheijen,
 who also slammed David Moyes after accusing him of overtraining Van Persie last 
pre-season, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ‘Holland looked tired & 
slow last night vs Wales. As expected, muscle injuries start to 
accumulate after weeks of intensive & double sessions.

‘Fit
 but tired players who have to train intensively twice a day will 
accumulate even more fatigue. Injury risk will increase dramatically.

‘Why are these NT (national team) coaches pushing their players so hard after a long season?’

Meanwhile, Van Gaal 
has ordered Manchester United staff to rip up the club's Carrington 
training ground pitches as he rings the changes at the club.

According to the Sun,
 the new Red Devils boss is keen for the Desso Grass-Master system to be
 installed ready for when he takes charge after managing Holland in this
 summer's World Cup finals.

The Dutchman's request has stunned the United hierarchy who believe their pitches are already pristine.
