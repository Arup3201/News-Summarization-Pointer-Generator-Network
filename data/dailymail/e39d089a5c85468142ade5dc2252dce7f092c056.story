Employers are being urged to watch their staff for signs of domestic violence - with indicators including shifts in behaviour and changes in clothing to hide bruises.

Public Health England (PHE) issued the warning and stressed that managers have a duty to spot people who are being abused and take steps to offer them support.

The PHE guidance is part of its campaign, 16 Days Of Action, which is running from November 25 to December 10, to highlight the responsibilities that employers have to protect their workers.

New campaign: Employers are being urged to watch their staff for signs of domestic violence by PHE

The campaign, which comes with an advisory 'violence toolkit for businesses' states: 'Women often experience repeated abuse for longer than men before reaching out for help.

'This means you may well be involved in managing someone who has experienced or is experiencing domestic abuse, as well as those who are perpetrators of abuse.'

Research says 25 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men fall victim to some form of domestic abuse during their lives.

As well as physical violence - this can also be verbal, emotional and financial abuse.

More than half of those affected by domestic abuse are absent from work at least three days a month - and 56 per cent of abused women arrive late for work at least five times per month.

A staggering two per cent of employees in the UK actually lose their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence and 75 per cent of victims are targeted at work.

This often includes harassing phone calls, text messages and emails - with abusive partners often turning up at the workplace.

PHE's guidance tells companies to record any incidents that take place at work and ensure that staff do not have to work alone or in isolated areas.

They are being encouraged to put up posters to highlight the support available for staff who disclose difficulties in their personal life.

And employers are also advised to divert phone calls and emails from suspected abusive partners and offer employees a new phone extension number if required. 

Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said: 'It is unacceptable that in England and Wales, two women a week die as a result of domestic violence, and many more suffer physical and mental harm.

'Workplaces are a safe space for many people living in violence and are key for providing opportunities for disclosure and support into safety. 

'As it stands, companies can do more to support their employees who experience domestic abuse, train those who witness, and protect staff as a whole.'

Mr Fenton believes companies which take steps to tackle the issue will actually benefit financially as there would be fewer unexplained absences and less staff turnover caused by violence at home. 

He adds: 'Signing up to the pledge and using the toolkit not only means businesses are supporting their staff and securing safety in the workplace, but they will also save on financial loss due to absence and turnover. 

'It is a win win for businesses and we urge them to utilise this resource.'

Speaking to The Independent he added: 'Bringing discussions of domestic violence into the workplace is a crucial step in providing routes to safety for people enduring violence.'

Companies are being urged to sign the 16 Days of Action pledge and join 'the global fight against domestic violence'.

The NHS is one of the first organisations to train its staff in dealing with the issue. 

Sue Covill, director of employment services at NHS Employers, claimed guidance was crucial as most managers would not be confident enough to intervene.

She said: 'It's not about the workplace intruding into personal matters but helping to ensure the workplace doesn't get in the way and can even speed up the process of recovery.'
