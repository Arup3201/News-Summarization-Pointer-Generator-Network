Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst hit by the Ebola crisis, has pulled out of next week's World Travel Market in London because of the epidemic.

Two other West African countries, Nigeria and Senegal, where the outbreak is deemed to be over, are going ahead with plans to participate.

The four-day travel trade exhibition at ExCel  centre in London Docklands starts on Monday.

A number of American states, including New York and California, have imposed quarantine periods on people, including health care workers, who have had direct contact with Ebola patients.

As many as 50,000 people are expected to attend the four-day WTM event. Formerly held at Earls Court in west London, WTM is now in its 35th year.

Last year’s WTM generated more than £2.2 billion in travel industry contracts.
