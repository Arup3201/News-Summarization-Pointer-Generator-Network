Freak accident: John Fozard, 66, was fatally cut by a broken wine glass which tore through the bin bag he was carrying

A man died in a 'freak accident' when a broken wine glass ripped through the bin bag he was carrying and severed an artery in his leg.

Bus enthusiast John Fozard, 66, lived alone on Anglesey, Wales, and was unable to stem the cut he suffered as he took out his rubbish.

The father-of-one was discovered lying surrounded by blood on his bathroom floor in May, after a worried next-door neighbour looked through his windows.

The neighbour, Gwyndaf Rowlands, told an inquest: 'There were pools of blood everywhere, splattered over the door 
and walls. I phoned for the police and paramedics.'

Retired Mr Fozard, who gave up his job as a bus engineer to photograph historic vehicles full-time, suffered an inch-and-a-half cut just above the knee which severed a femoral artery.

The artery is one of the largest in the human body and carries blood to the legs and feet from the heart.

PC Daniel Doughty, who found Mr Fozard in the bathroom, said the bath was full of water and the carpet soaked.

He added: 'It looked like he had tried to mop up his own blood.

'It would appear he was trying to do something, possibly confused.

'There was a broken wine glass recovered from a bin bag in the kitchen - it looked as though he had tried to empty the bin.'

Pathologist Dr Mark Lord added: 'If he had reached emergency services on the phone they may have been able to identify a pressure point.

'But the speed with which it bled may not have given him time to reach the phone.'

Bus
and train enthusiasts paid tribute to Mr Fozard, who was born in West 
Yorkshire where he lived for more than 50 years before moving to the 
Anglesey village of Llanerchymedd.

He had bought several buses, starting in 1975 with a South Yorkshire Albion coach which he named Cyril and drove across Britain. Later he ran a model railway firm called North Eastern Design.

His friend Hugh Taylor, 68, was working with him to restore a rare Glasgow tram which is due to be displayed at the East Anglia Transport Museum.

He told MailOnline: 'His knowledge will be greatly missed. He had a lot of contacts who were customers and friends. It was a real shock.

'He was very knowledgeable about every kind and type of bus and tram and trolley bus throughout the British Isles. He could identify pictures just at a glance and that was wonderful.

'It was a freak accident. He was taking rubbish out to the bin and there was some broken glass in the rubbish bag and as he was going out the shard cut him in his leg.'

A tribute posted on Mr Taylor's website by Mr Fozard's son Simon said: 'Over the last few years, John enjoyed time with his new partner, Judy, and her family. They spent many happy hours walking around Anglesey and North Wales, including climbing Mount Snowdon.

'John will be remembered by many people, all of which will probably think of him in a different way.

'Undoubtedly, many will remember him for his time keeping, "I'll be there around 12.00ish" which could mean any time from 12.00pm to 12.59pm, and his laid back attitude.

'Others may remember him with his yellow coat on, camera round neck, photographing trains.'

Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'It would appear he tried to deal with the injury but failed to do so and eventually collapsed in the bathroom from the loss of blood.'
