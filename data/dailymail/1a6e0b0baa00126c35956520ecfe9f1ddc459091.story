Police have released a shocking surveillance tape showing a 10-year-old girl who escaped from a creepy suspect who tried to abduct her as she walked home.

A $10,000 reward is being offered for the arrest and conviction of a suspect in the attempted abduction of the girl in south Philadelphia.

Police said the man followed the girl in his car on Tuesday as she was walking with her 2-year-old brother in the Whitman neighbourhood.

Stalker: As the children turn the corner, the suspect can be seen getting out of his vehicle and following them

As the children walk past, the man can be seen exiting a white vehicle and following them.

He then put his hand over the girl's mouth and tried to carry her away.

Police said the girl struggled and then fell, and the man tried to abduct her again before fleeing.

Investigators released surveillance video on Wednesday, and Mayor Michael Nutter asked for help from the public, calling the events 'totally outrageous.'

He said: 'Our children must be able to walk around their own neighbourhood' without fear of such crimes.

The suspect is described as a Hispanic male 30-40 years old, between 5'9" and 6'0" tall, with a thin build, short black curly hair and a thin moustache.

He was wearing a black short-sleeve T-shirt, and blue pants.

He was driving a late 1990′s-early 2000′s white mid-sized Sedan, possibly a Mitsubishi or Nissan - with a black scuff mark on driver’s side rear bumper and dent on left front fender wheel well.

Police urge anyone with information to call 215.686.TIPS (8477).

Vehicle: The suspect's car is a earlier model sedan with visible signs of damage in the front and back
