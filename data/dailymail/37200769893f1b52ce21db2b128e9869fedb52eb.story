A millionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur gave her son a lethal cocktail of pills after the autistic eight-year-old boy suggested they took their lives together, she has claimed.

Gigi Jordan, who is on trial in Manhattan for the 2010 killing of Jude Mirra, testified that she gave the boy pills after he wrote messages on her BlackBerry suggesting the suicide pact - as the jury rolled their eyes, the New York Post reported. 

Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son after he took the pills.

Even though the second grader was unable to speak, she claims he urged her to take their lives by typing messages on her phone, the Post reported.

She claims they both feared that her ex-husband, Raymond Mirra, would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her. She said she did not know what would become of her son.

'Let's just get out while we can,' she claims Jude wrote on January 26, 2010, days before his body was found in the Peninsula Hotel. 'We r going to die anyway let's do it ourselves instead of them.

'We need to leave in a way we want to, not their way. Get the pills and try to do it.' 

She claims he wrote other messages claiming it wouldn't be murder and urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully.

'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' 

She testified that she was in a place of desperation because she lived in fear of her ex-husband, who had legally adopted Jude. 

'I felt numb, defeated, I felt like it was over, it was done,' she said. 'There was nothing I could do.'

In court on Thursday, she explained that she deliberately gave her son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him.

When she heard him struggle to breathe, 'my heart started pounding,' she testified.

'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.'

Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son.

Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed.

Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him. 

Killed: The boy was non-verbal, had PTSD and immune system abnormalities, his mother claims

'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said.

Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime.

Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning.

They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe.

Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note.

She has denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him. 

The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan.

Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm.

Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. 

One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days.
