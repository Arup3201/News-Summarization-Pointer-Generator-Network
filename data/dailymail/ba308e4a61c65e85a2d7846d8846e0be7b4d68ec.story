A couple has filed for a restraining order against their neighbor who they claim has installed cameras that point directly at their bedroom windows and called police on them multiple times.

Scott and Terri Gale, who live opposite Natalie Belk in Kemah, Texas, claim in a suit filed on November 21 that police have been to their home as many as 40 times 'for no reason'.

They explained that, years ago, they and other neighbors had complained to Belk and the police about her dog being unleashed in her front yard - sparking the years of tension.

They claim that 40-year-old Belk has since recorded their movements and conversations inside and outside of their home with two security cameras and a cell phone.

'Harassed': Scott and Terri Gale, pictured, claim their neighbor has installed cameras on her house pointing directly into their bedroom and has repeatedly called the police on them

They say the cameras were installed in September 2012 and point at their balcony, which leads into their bedroom, and they have had to set up privacy screens, the Houston Chronicle reported.

'At a direct angle of the camera's 
view is also our master bathroom, including a glass door stall shower 
and powder room, both directly visible from the street,' Mr Gale said
 in the affidavit.

They write that she has gone on to report them to local police, and that officers have visited their home as many as 40 times. They did not elaborate on the claims she had made against them but said there was 'no valid reason' for her calls.

Police have advised to wear body cameras to protect themselves against further false claims - and 'we cannot walk to the mailbox, do yardwork or taking the garbage out' without them, they said.

Home: They live at this home in Kemah, Texas and said her cameras point directly at their balcony

Across the road: Natalie Belk has installed cameras outside her home, which is across the street

Now one of Belk's sons has started to
 record Scott Gale on a cell phone every time he is outside the home, 
they said in the affidavit.

'My wife and I were out on our front 
balcony pulling down the privacy shades... and the boy came out and stood leaning against 
the rear bumper of Ms. Belk's truck, looking at us and recording our 
conversation with his phone, apparently both audio and video,' Gale said.

As
 a result of her harassment, the Gales, who have lived at the address 
since 2002, say they are unable to enjoy their home and have had to pay 
attorneys to defend themselves against her claims.

In
 the suit, they explain that the tension began when they complained 
about the dog and in 2008, they filed a police report about the 
'increasing threat' they felt from Belk and her family.

Too close: They said that they are also filmed across the street by her son when they leave their home

Threatened: The couple said they must wear cameras whenever they go outside in case they need to defend themselves against her claims. They have filed a restraining order and are seeking damages

And when Terri Gale entered local politics, Belk allegedly stepped up her harassment - calling the police 11 times between February 2011 and November 2012.

In their suit, the Gales have asked the court for a temporary restraining order to stop the threats and filming. They are also asking unspecified damages.
