Ryanair is heralding a new partnership that allows its customers to book accommodation at more than half a million hotels – although its chief rival has had a deal with the same provider for two years.

Europe’s largest budget airline announced today that the agreement will allow customers to reserve rooms through Booking.com whilst booking a flight via Ryanair’s website.

But the deal itself will not give the Dublin-based airline an advantage over its chief rival, easyJet, which has been offering hotel reservations through Booking.com since 2012.

Kenny Jacobs, the chief marketing officer tasked with overseeing Ryanair’s image makeover, admitted Booking.com’s partnerships with Ryanair and easyJet are ‘very similar’.

But he insists Ryanair has an edge because it has a larger flight network than its low-cost rival.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘What sets us apart is that we have more destinations. It will be the choice of places you can use Booking.com once you’ve gotten there on Ryanair.’

Mr Jacobs added: ‘We’ve got ambitions to be more than just an airline. One of those things is giving our customers a better accommodation option because they have asked us for that and I think Booking.com is the best one that we could get.’

Booking.com has partnerships with more than 80 airlines around the world, including three in the UK. 

Ryanair’s deal with the Amsterdam-based company, considered the largest hotel booking website in the world, is its latest effort to win over customers as part of its ‘Always Getting Better’ programme.

The controversial airline launched the charm offensive to revamp its image – and boost revenue – after years of complaints about its surcharges and poor customer service.

Ryanair claims the partnership with Booking.com will offer customers the ‘best price guaranteed’ with over 550,000 hotels and accommodation to choose from.

Now in its second year, the ‘Always Getting Better’ programme has seen the launch of a redesigned website, an app with mobile boarding passes, business seating and a softened stance on baggage charges and booking conditions.

Mr Jacobs said the programme will continue to focus on all things ‘digital and data’ in the coming year, although passengers who want in-flight wifi will ‘probably’ have to wait until after 2015.
