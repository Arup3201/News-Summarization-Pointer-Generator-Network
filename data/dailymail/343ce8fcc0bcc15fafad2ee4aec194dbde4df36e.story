Frustrated users of the App Store, Mac App Store and iTunes around the world were unable to download songs and apps from Apple's sites for much of the day.

The services were down for approximately eleven hours and the long outage may have cost Apple millions of dollars in lost sales.

Apple has revealed technical problems caused by an internal DNS error - although all service have now been restored. 

Error: Outage is thought to be affecting would-be customers in the UK, US, Canada, India and other regions

Apple also confirmed in an update on its status page that the issue was global.

This morning, the page claimed that all services were functioning well - despite there being problems - but it has now been updated to show that the App Store, iTunes Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store are all 'unavailable to all users'.

This afternoon, Apple issued a statement, saying: 'We apologise to our customers experiencing problems with iTunes and other services this morning. 

'The cause was an internal DNS error at Apple. We’re working to make all of the services available to customers as soon as possible, and we thank everyone for their patience.'

Currently music, film and TV content is visible in the iTunes Stores, but users can’t  buy it. 

Some users have seen error messages, while others are simply unable to download the goods they want in the digital stores. 

The front pages of both the App Store and Mac App Store are accessible, but there are broken pages on the sites when accessing individual apps. 

Currently some customers simply see a spinning circle indicating that a song is in the process of being downloaded, but nothing happens.

Others are shown an error page saying that content cannot be displayed, or that the store is temporarily unavailable and could not complete their request, when they try to download an album. 

The status page also reveals that some users had problems accessing their iCloud mail this morning and may have been unable to sign in.

A post from Californian tech giant's Apple Support twitter handle said: 'APP STORE ISSUE: You may be receiving an error this morning. Apple are currently working on this and we do apologise.'

In 2014 Apple revealed in that it had made $18.06 billion in revenue from iTunes, including its software and services, making up 10 per cent of Apple's total net sales.

If this year's revenues match 2014's, the firm could be losing more than $2 million an hour  - equivalent to $34,000 every minute.

London-based social media analyst Tim Grimes tweeted: 'Based on 2014 iTunes Revenue: Apple are losing $34,246 per minute, $2,054,794 per hour the #iTunes store is down.'

Seeing as the outage encompasses other services, it could follow that Apple's losses are much higher than this.

Tim Cook has previously said that the App Store posted $4.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014, which means that firm could also be losing around $2 million an hour, or almost $35,000 a minute.

One person tweeted: 'If iTunes doesn't start working within the next two hours I will literally cry...' while another said 'iTunes store has been down for like 2 hours.'

A user called MisterDanD said: ' iTunes, App Store is DOWN worldwide, which is screwing up my morning! has someone hacked them? #apple #iTunes' and a user called lightcap wrote: 'Apple's app store is down (for purchasing, not browsing), but the world's most useless site remains useless as ever...' posting a link to the company's status page.

Making a humorous reference to Apple's new MacBook, which was unveiled with just one port earlier this week, Twitter user schwarztech said: 'Maybe someone accidentally unplugged the single USB-C cable that the App/iBook Storer runs off of?'

The outage appears to have been ongoing for several hours this morning, according to The Next Web, which said that iBooks and in-app purchases can't be accessed.

TestFlight - a service used by developers to test apps - is also down, as well as Apple Support, meaning it is hard for customers to get help in accessing the services.  

Earlier today the problems seem to be geographically inconsistent. For example, it's been reported that it's possible to download apps from the Indian App Store, but music tracks are inaccessible.

But now Apple has said the outage is affecting all its users across the world, but has yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

The App Store was last down on Monday, but the move was intentional as Apple prepared to launch its Apple Watch in San Francisco.
