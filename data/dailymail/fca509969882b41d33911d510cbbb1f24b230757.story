Adam Lallana looks set to snub Manchester United after setting his heart on a summer move to Liverpool.

Sportsmail revealed last week that United planned a £55million double deal for Southampton pair Lallana and Luke Shaw.

But while Shaw, 18, is preparing for a move to Old Trafford, England midfielder Lallana has decided on Merseyside.

On his way? Southampton's Adam Lallana could be set for a summer move to Liverpool

Southampton continue to insist their star players are going nowhere but should be braced for offers as soon as the season finishes next month.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will authorise an opening bid of around £15m for Lallana, who is expected to play in the hole behind Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. He can expect to double his £35,000-a-week earnings.

Roy Hodgson will name the 25-year-old in his England World Cup squad despite nagging concerns over a groin injury, which might have kept him out of the final two Barclays Premier League matches.

However, the Southampton captain wants to face Swansea on Saturday before signing off against Manchester United on the final day of the season.

The Southampton board face a potentially tricky summer, with left back Shaw also unwilling to delay his move to a big club any longer.

United and Chelsea are both keen on him and the teenager is worried that he may miss the boat if he gives it another year on the south coast.

Saints will also find it difficult to hold on to central defender Dejan Lovren after an outstanding season.

The Croat has been linked with Liverpool and clubs across Europe just 12 months after arriving in an £8million move from Lyon.

Even more worryingly, there are fears that manager Mauricio Pochettino will snub planned contract talks next month as the chance to manage Tottenham looms larger.

The Argentine’s deal expires at the end of next season.
