The actress, who starred in Country Strong and  on Broadway in Of Mice and Men, has shared her style diary, fashion tips and future plans with the designer label.

'The Jimmy Choo shoots were some of my favourite photos I've had taken,' she said. 'The clothes, and obviously shoes, bags and shades were wonderful, and the photography, styling and atmosphere was awesome.

'The whole team was such a pleasure to work with and it was the most fun day I've had shooting.'

Speaking about her sense of style and how it's changed over the years, the actress, who cites Diane Keaton and Stevie Nicks as her icons, said: 'Like anyone, I've gone through phases, but the biggest difference is that I'm less concerned with fashion for fashion's sake. 

'I find that I'm happiest when I'm comfortable in my favourite key items, so I just add or subtract from my tried and true items to create a certain look.'

The former Gossip Girl star - who is married to actor Adam Brody - says her approach to fashion is to 'not taking it too seriously', and 'buck judgment'. 

As well as conquering the fashion and beauty world (she was also unveiled as the face of Biotherm in 2013), Leighton is hoping to take the music industry by storm, too. 

'I just got back from a tour for Heartstrings, my first record,' she said. 'I played in cities and now planning on another leg for more shows. It has been a really great experience traveling with my music. 

'I've been working on the record for over two years so I'm really pleased to finally tour with it and I've grown immensely because of it. It's insanely fun performing my songs, and it feels surreal interacting with the people who've heard it. It's a confessional, very personal record and I'm really proud of every aspect of it.'

When she isn't modelling or jamming, Leighton says she spends most of her time travelling, gardening and cooking.

'The most important aspect of emotional well-being for me is getting enough rest,' she said.

'I go to sleep and wake up early, and rest when I need, which is important in staying healthy when you have a hectic schedule. Stretching, staying hydrated and keeping my body in motion, even with a relaxing walk, is very equalising.'
