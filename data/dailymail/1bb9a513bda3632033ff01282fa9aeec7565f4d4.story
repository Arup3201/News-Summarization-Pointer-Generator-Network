In this job, every second counts.

When two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line in April, spraying metal shards, nails and ball bearings into a crowd of thousands, the technicians didn't have time to deploy bomb x-ray machines.

Putting their own lives at risk, Boston bomb squad sergeant Chris Connolly and his team frantically knifed open a minefield of backpacks by hand in search of more devices to prevent another devastating blast.

The so-called hand entry - a Hollywood-style search for the red wire - is not standard procedure, according to an exclusive report by WIRED.

In an average operation, a team of bomb technicians will spend several hours 
disassembling a single device.

But after surveying the scene, Connolly quickly realized every bag could be hiding a device and 'blind hand entry' was the only option to save lives.

'If two [bombs], why not three?' Connolly 
thought as he tore into the bags with a knife.

He avoided zippers, which could be a 
trigger, as he cut into the base of the packs.

Connolly was about one of about a dozen bomb techs stationed at the finish line before the April 15 Marathon commenced.

Earlier that morning, the team had searched the area for bombs - peering inside trash cans, peeking into car and store windows and inspected flower planters. That is standard procedure in the post-9/11 world.

The team felt it was ready for any potential bomb threat as about half a million spectators turned out to watch nearly 25,000 athletes run the Marathon.

But according to WIRED, the Boston bombings was the 'worst day of their lives' that required an unorthodox response. 

For technician Mitch McCormick, seeing twisted sheet metal and a battery among the debris after the bombings - so obviously out of place among the discarded shoes and jackets of the runners - was a sign the bomb had been hidden in a backpack.

'Well, now I know what I’m looking for,' he thought.

He told himself: 'Mitch, this is American history in the making, and you’re smack-dab in the middle of it. Now don’t f*** this up, ’cause you’d rather be dead than have another one of these go off.'

Meanwhile, Connolly was still cutting up bags.

'I’m gonna f****** die,' he thought. 'One of these is gonna be real. But that’s OK. If it goes, it goes. That’s just the way it’s going to be today.'

That's when he realized he needed more technicians to clear the bags, and put in a desperate call for back-up.

When Todd Brown arrived on scene, he felt he had stepped into a minefield.

Fresh from training with a retired Israeli bomb technician who taught his unit how to assess and cut into suspicious packages found near victims at a still-warm blast scene, Brown knew he had to check the bags.

With only a cheap blade in his pocket, he ran up to backpacks in the crowd, placed his body between bags and a victim prone on the ground and cut.

About 45 bomb technicians and 40 K-9 handlers had answered Boston police's call for help.

Over the next few days, technicians pulled off grueling 16-hour days to keep up with reports of suspicious packages around time.

The bomb squad deployed sophisticated equipment, including the Logos XR200, a portable x-ray unit powered by a Dewalt battery from a cordless drill, for the more suspicious looking packages.

The week after the marathon, Connolly met with the police commissioner to review the bomb squad’s performance.

He was worried they had missed the pressure cookers used by the bombers during that morning’s sweep of Boylston Street where the bombs hit. They hadn’t, but many in the team still felt guilty. 

'Bombs went off in our city,' McCormick says. 'We’re the bomb squad. I wish we could have prevented it.'
