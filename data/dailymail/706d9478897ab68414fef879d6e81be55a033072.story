Kaitlin Taylor went to the Syracuse University health center in hopes of getting treated for flu symptoms but instead was sent to a psychiatric ward

A New Jersey student with a bad cold was locked in a hospital psych ward for six days after going to her university's heath center for a medication to treat flu-like symptoms, she alleges in a lawsuit.

Kaitlin Taylor, of Union County, New Jersey, went to the campus health center at Syracuse  - a school she's since left - when she was a sophomore in September 2013 complaining of flu-like symptoms.

But the six-day stay in the nearby St Joseph's Hospital was not what she was expecting when she told the center's staff that she was suffering from a fever, cough, phlegm and chest congestion. 

While waiting for care, Taylor said she told a counselor that she wanted to change her arts major and take a leave of absence from the school but missed the semester's deadline because her computer was stolen. 

When she was told no one could write her a prescription at the center, she was driven to St Joseph's and dropped in front the the emergency room, according to the New York Post. 

While waiting in the ER, Taylor said she felt as though she was getting sicker. 

'I was getting stressed by the circumstances and the surroundings,' she told the Post. 'I thought I'd only be there for an hour or two.'

She was then taken to a psychiatrist's office, where she spent 15 minutes explaining that she was sick, had not been sleeping well, was struggling in her classes and feared she might lose her scholarship. 

Taylor was then told that she would  have to stay overnight and was sent to an 'observation room' with four other patients.

The psychiatrist's notes said that Taylor was in for 'involuntary treatment,' for 'insomnia, pressured speech, disorganized, declining grades'.  

The patients in the room were separated by low walls while staff watched over them, Taylor said. She still didn't receive medication or treatment. 

She wanted to call her mom, but her cellphone had died and she said the hospital wouldn't recharge it.

Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her. Her hospital horror started at her university's health center (pictured), where she went to get medication

'They hadn't done anything for me or my cold. They didn't take my blood pressure or even my temperature,' she told the Post. 

 A nurse told her that if she cooperated and took the medication they gave her, she would be out in a shorter time period. 

She said she was given Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Klonopin, used to treat panic disorder. 

Taylor told the post that they had to line up and take their pills, 'just like in the movie Cuckoo's Nest'. 

She was finally able to reach her mom, who came to the hospital to get her out of the ward. 

Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her, negligent and harmful use of medication and failure to get informed consent, among other reasons, the lawsuit states, according to the Daily Orange.

Marc Held, Taylor's lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, said her treatment was 'unfathomable'. 

The lawsuit claims that the 'unlawful, negligent and otherwise improper confinement', caused Taylor to suffer 'personal indignities'.

Taylor has since left Syracuse and transferred to Rutgers University. 

Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz, senior vice president and dean of student affairs, said in a statement to the Daily Orange that the university 'strongly support the medical professionals and staff in the center'. 

In November 2014 the university announced they were in the process of searching for a new psychiatric provider and since has hired additional staff.

Syracuse's attorney Matthew Larkin, however, told the Post that the university 'denies that it acted inappropriately in any way'. 

A St Joseph's spokesman wouldn't comment due to patient privacy and pending litigation.
