The NHS has launched an unprecedented call for an army of ‘Good Samaritans’ to look in on lonely elderly neighbours and make sure they are coping this winter.

It has issued a call for 100,000 volunteers to sign a pledge committing to visiting older people to check they are warm and have everything they need.

The new Winter Friends pledge is being backed by the Daily Mail, which has been running a Dignity for the Elderly Campaign. A host  of celebrities, including Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry, have already signed up.

Last winter, there were an estimated 31,100 excess deaths due to winter conditions – a 29 per cent increase on the previous year. Most are over 75 and the majority of the deaths are entirely avoidable.

Hundreds of thousands of others spend much of the winter alone and lonely.

The NHS appeal comes a month after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain should be ashamed of the way it treats grandparents and urged families to take a leaf out of the book of Asian nations, where they take more responsibility for elderly relatives and do not leave caring to the state.

Surveys have found more than half of 
over-75s live alone and five million older people say TV is their main 
form of company. One study found the lack of social connections is as 
likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Last winter 81-year-old stroke victim 
Gloria Foster starved to death after the local council failed to send 
round home helps for nine days.

Winnifred Green, 88, who has regular visitors

Winifred Green, 88, has lived alone on a quiet street in Liverpool since losing her husband Edward to a heart attack 15 years ago.

The former interior designer’s remaining family live in Ireland and are too busy to see or speak to her. Worse still, 14 years ago a fall down a flight of stairs badly injured Winifred’s back, leaving her reliant on a mobility scooter to get around.

Desperately lonely, Winifred spent months at a time barely leaving her house, let alone speaking to anyone else. ‘I have never felt so isolated in my life,’ she recalled. ‘I would cry a lot. I was just watching the television, listening to the radio and sleeping. I was desperate for company. It just went on and on.’

Finally, four months ago Winifred called the charity Independent Age that helped alert her neighbours to her predicament. Two now visit regularly.

Miriam lives opposite and helps Winifred with her shopping and Pat lives around the corner and tidies her house once a week. Both make time for a cup of tea and a chat.

‘Waking up and knowing I’m going to see someone even for half an hour has changed my life,’ she said.

‘I’m happy again. The last few winters have been awful; it’s always dark and the nights last forever when you are on your own. This  is the first time in years I’m not dreading Christmas.’

In January, a nurse from a care agency visited stroke victim Gloria Foster, 81.

Gloria depended on these visits four times a day for food, water and medication as she lived alone in Banstead, Surrey.

Her husband, Bob, an accountant, died in a car crash 30 years ago and they had no children.

After giving her some spaghetti and fruit juice the nurse left Gloria watching television. 

Nine days later a district nurse visited by chance – and discovered the agency that had been looking after Gloria had closed down and no one had checked on her.

Gloria was found severely dehydrated, suffering kidney failure, with serious bed sores and only a faint pulse.

Her walking frame was out of her reach and she had been unable to call for help. Sadly, she died in hospital 11 days later.

And earlier this month, hundreds attended the funeral of Harold Percival, a 91-year-old war veteran, after an appeal for mourners in a local newspaper revealed he died with no close friends or relatives.

The campaign is being led by the NHS Choices website and seeks to help by appealing to an old-fashioned sense of neighbourliness.

The NHS suggests that people could agree to check in once a week, or more if it turns very cold. They could check the person’s home is warm enough, make sure they have enough food, offer to pick up prescriptions, clear the snow in front of their house, or offer to take them on a walk.

Those who sign the Winter Friends pledge will receive free cold weather alerts and email tips throughout the winter to help them do their bit. One of the first to sign was Miss Lumley, who said last night: ‘A little help really does go a long way. You will also find, I’m sure, that giving a bit of your time in this way is hugely rewarding.’

Fry, host of QI, said: ‘Isolated, vulnerable and elderly people are the most at risk. It’s a tragedy when most of these deaths could be avoided, so that’s why I’ll be tweeting my support for the NHS Choices Winter Friends pledge.’

Other celebrities supporting the campaign include former weather girl Ulrika Jonsson, Olympic gold medallist Sally Gunnell, actors Sir Tony Robinson and Olivia Colman, presenters Richard Madeley and Jenni Falconer, and rapper Plan B.

Attitude: Ros Coward believes the impulse to take care of others is still there - we just need to nurture it

The man must have been in his early 80s. He shuffled towards the bar of the pub, placed his coins down and asked for a pint of beer. I watched as he tried to strike up conversation with the young barman, who barely lifted his eyes from the till.

Rebuffed, the old man slowly made his way back to his table. The day before I’d felt the same pang when I witnessed the bus conductor drumming his fingers as an elderly woman struggled to get off.

And again, when another octogenarian was met by indifference as she tried to exchange pleasantries with a supermarket cashier.

Most of the time we are too wrapped up in our own lives to notice this kind of exchange. But when an elderly person close to you becomes dependent – as my mother did when she developed dementia – you realise how lonely old age can be. And how frightening.

Social isolation in old age is no trivial matter. Recent studies indicate that lack of social interaction is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

That’s why the NHS Winter Friends campaign is so valuable: it reminds us there are plenty around us for whom a friendly face and an offer of help is hugely important. It could even mean the difference between life and death.

Like most modern families, we didn’t think of moving my mother in with us when she was diagnosed in 2008.

We tried to supply all her needs by regularly visiting her and hiring her a carer. But, even with this, she was often at risk alone, and it was easy to see how losing any of those props would have resulted in isolation.

Before her illness, I – like most of us with busy jobs – was guilty of not giving elderly neighbours enough thought. Not only do you become more aware when a loved one is in the same boat, you also begin to realise the value of the small acts of kindness. 

Condemned: Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain should be ashamed of the way they treat grandparents

I saw the huge difference some people made to my mother’s life – neighbours who checked up on her, a caretaker for her block of flats who stopped to share a joke. These tiny deeds  cost nothing but make a huge difference. Of course, those who are still able to get out and about are relatively fortunate. There are plenty more who are housebound.

I have elderly neighbours who do not have family nearby, who can no longer get out and cannot access even the fairly minimal help available. There is one couple in their 90s who, although they have each other, rely on one or two neighbours to do their shopping.Ivy was another.

She is now dead but for many years she was my next door neighbour and eventually could not get down her steps. 

Sadly, she spent most of her last years alone in front of the television. A recent survey reveals that 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and five million elderly say the television is their main form of company.

There are plenty who are entirely isolated – and this becomes all the more difficult when winter grips.Like many of her thrifty generation, my mother was prone to turning off all the radiators in her house except the one she was sitting beside. Ivy did the same, often barricading herself into one room and remaining static by her gas fire. Thankfully there were neighbours to check on them both, but what if there hadn’t been?

By signing up to Winter Friends, you can help make sure that that is not the case for vulnerable elderly people living near you.

And you’re not burdening yourself with an unachievable commitment – you’ll simply be doing your bit when the weather is cold by looking in on an elderly friend or neighbour, checking radiators are on and food is in the cupboards.

I believe the impulse to take care of others is still there – we just need to nurture it. After all, one day it might be you.
