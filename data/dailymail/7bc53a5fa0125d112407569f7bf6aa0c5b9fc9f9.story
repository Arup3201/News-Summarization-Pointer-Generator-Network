A pensioner has sparked anger among his neighbours after piling a huge collection of broken bicycles outside his home.

David Watts, 73, has been running a repair business from his house in Maidstone, Kent since 1971 but now admits his hoard has got out of hand.

He collects bikes quicker than he can mend or sell them and scores of them are heaped in his garden which some neighbours say has become an eyesore.

Pensioner David Watts has sparked anger among his neighbours after piling hundreds of rusting bicycles outside his home in Maidstone, Kent. He admits his collection has got out of hand 

Fed-up neighbours have complained to the council but the authority has told them there is nothing they can do as Mr Watts (pictured) is officially licensed as a second-hand trader 

Eyesore: Maidstone Borough Council's parking department said they were powerless to act as the trailers full of bicycles are not attached to vehicles

Mr Watts has so many bikes that his collection has spilled out into the road where two large trailers are also filled with them.

Fed-up neighbours have complained to the council but the authority has told them there is nothing they can do as Mr Watts is officially licensed as a second-hand trader.

They add that his trailers are not in breach of parking regulations because they are not attached to vehicles.

But officials have promised to look again at the case after more complaints from people living nearby. 

One resident said: 'When David ran the scrap business from the same address I had no problem with it, but this has escalated now.

'He has more bikes than a cycle shop and it's getting to be a bit of an eyesore.'

The former driving instructor insists that it is 'just a hobby that has got out of hand'.

Piled high: Council officials have promised to look again at the case after received more complaints from people living nearby 

'I repair neighbours' bikes - if they bring one round I'll fix it for them,' he said.

'It's a bit untidy but I can't help that, I'm an untidy person. I need something to do in my old age.'

Despite being dubbed 'Scrap Metal Dave' by some neighbours, Mr Watts said he does not sell the bikes for scrap metal. He claims he makes 'around £50-a-week' selling them to locals which helps provide extra income for him and his disabled wife Maureen.

He said: 'People have a problem because they don't like my trailers being parked in the public parking bays but I'm not breaking the law.

'My wife isn't happy about the whole thing and she has banned me from keeping them indoors.

'But it is a little bit of extra money that helps us to tick by.'

Mr Watts, a grandfather-of-four, insists his bikes are not scrap and will be sold, repaired or used for parts. But he admits he has been overrun by them.

In a spin: Mr Watts' wife Maureen, 71, is not a fan of the collection and has banned him from working in the house, complaining that she can no longer do the gardening 

He added: 'This is not council property, this is my house.

'I'm registered as a bike dealer and have a scrap metal license, but if I was a scrap dealer then I wouldn't keep it all here as that would be pointless.

'I used to go and sell them at car boot sales but I can't do that anymore because I'm at home looking after my wife.

'It is just a hobby I have, I pick them up, repair them then sell them to kids and stuff. I only sell them for £20 or so and new ones normally go for over a hundred.'

His wife Maureen, 71, is not a fan of the collection and has banned him from working in the house, complaining that she can no longer do the gardening. 

Maidstone Borough Council's parking department said they were powerless to act as the trailers full of bicycles are not attached to vehicles.

A council spokesman added: 'We have received complaints about the property being untidy and are looking into the issue.'

Kent County Council Trading Standards confirmed that Mr Watts is a registered trader of second hand goods.
