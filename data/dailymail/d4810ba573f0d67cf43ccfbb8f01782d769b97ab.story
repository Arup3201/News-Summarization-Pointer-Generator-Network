Former Channel Seven weatherman Grant Denyer has told of the moment he realised he knew the man behind the Sydney siege - Man Haron Monis.

As he watched the crisis unfold nearly two weeks ago, right across from his old workplace, the Family Feud host soon discovered   the gunman was the man who used to hassle him and his wife Chezzie when they lived in Chinatown - Sydney's CBD, the Herald Sun reports.

This comes after fresh claims that Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel Seven and in particular their Sunrise program - where Denyer once worked.

As he watched the siege unfold, right across from his old workplace, the Family Feud host said he and his wife Chezzie were often hassled by Monis (right) when they used to live in Chinatown - Sydney's CBD

'I used to see him on my street corner all the time - ranting,' Denyer told the Herald Sun.

'I always put myself between him and my wife... there was a really bad vibe around him.

'When I saw his face on the television it all came flooding back.'

Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments.

The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel Seven's Sunrise studio last week.

The attack took place so near Seven's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. 

Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year.

It's been nearly two weeks since the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place, which resulted in the death of Monis and two other hostages  Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.
