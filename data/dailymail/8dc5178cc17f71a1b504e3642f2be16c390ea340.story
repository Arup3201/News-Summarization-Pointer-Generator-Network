A three year-old boy suffered serious head injuries after a music speaker fell off a Turkish hotel balcony and landed on him as he lay on a sunlounger below.

Stanley Burch, from Rainham, Kent, suffered a fractured skull and bleeding to the brain after the incident at the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum.

He was rushed to hospital in the resort where he underwent an emergency operation and spent ten days in intensive care before he was allowed to fly home earlier this week.

'He's a fighter': Three-year-old Stanley Burch, from Rainham, Kent, needed surgery after a speaker cut his head

Stanley is now recovering well at home in Kent, where his parents are considering legal action against package holiday organisers, Thomson Holidays.

Stanley's father Mitchell Burch, 32, said: 'We were just sitting on the sunloungers when the hotel's speaker fell off the balcony and onto my son's head.

'It was a huge speaker, at least a metre high.  There was a massive cut on his head - it was horrendous.'

Mr Burch, a supervisor at Thames Water, added: 'We gave statements to the police out there and we're taking action against the hotel.

'They haven't even apologised yet which I think is disgusting.'

Mr Burch who lives with his partner, Stanley's mother Amy Belcher, 29, and their daughter, Rosie, five, is now concentrating on getting the little boy better.

'This was a very frightening experience but Amy and I are glad that our son is out of any immediate danger and we are all back home.

Recovering: Stanley was on holiday in the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum with his sister, Rosie, five, and parents

'We want to concentrate on Stanley and ensuring he recovers fully from his injuries.  Stanley has been amazing throughout this and he is a true fighter.'

The family's solicitor, brain injury specialist Mark Gore, said it was too early to say whether Stanley had sustained permanent damage in the accident on 12 June.

Mr Gore said: 'This was a nasty accident in which a young child has sustained a head injury and the full circumstances are being investigated.'

He said Stanley was off nursery and would not be going back until the new school year in September.

Mr Gore added it was possible that Stanley could have suffered permanent brain damage but that it was too early to be sure.

He said: 'Luckily Stanley is out of hospital and he's walking around and talking. But he has suffered a serious head injury so it may well have long term consequences.

'He also has a large scar on his head from the operation to repair his fractured skull.'

A spokesman for holiday company Thomson, First Choice and Thomson Cruises said: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at the Yasmin Resort in Bodrum. As a result a child was taken to hospital.

'We are working with the hotel to conduct a full investigation to understand what happened. Our resort team offered every possible support and assistance whilst the family were in resort.

'Our Welfare Team based in the UK has also been in contact with the family since their return home and they continue to offer further support.'
