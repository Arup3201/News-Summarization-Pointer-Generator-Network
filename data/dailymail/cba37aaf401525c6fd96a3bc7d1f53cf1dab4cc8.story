Police detained a lone yachtsman under the Mental Health Act after paramedics, a rescue helicopter, the RNLI and coastguards were all involved in a 12-hour rescue.

The 65-year-old sailor, who has not been named, was detained by police who deemed him not to be of sound mind.

The man issued a Mayday call after his 36ft boat, named the Mary Celeste, hit rocks off Eastbourne East Sussex on Friday.

A Yachtsman emerged from his vessel after a 12-hour rescue operation when his boat hit rocks off Eastbourne. He had initially refused help and was later arrested by police

He first got into difficulty in heavy 
seas off Bexhill at about 10.05am. The man initially did not want help 
despite the 'atrocious weather’  which worsened the situation.

Dover Coastguard received erratic radio communications from the vessel which had drifted dangerously close inshore and requested the volunteer RNLI crew to investigate.

Lifeboats approached the boat but the skipper initially refused to make contact. Coastguard officers had to negotiate with the sailor, who refused their offers to help.

A lone yachtsman was rescued by emergency services from his boat in high winds, heavy seas and shallow water

Coastguards monitored the progress 
of the yacht throughout the day and became increasingly concerned 
for the safety of the man.

Weather conditions deteriorated and in driving rain and gale force
winds a ‘Mayday’ distress call was received at 8.05pm by Dover coastguard from 
the yacht which had run aground on the beach below South Cliff Tower.

Rescuers were initially unable to approach the yacht due to 
the low tide and breaking surf.

Lifeboat coxswain Mark Sawyer requested 
the assistance of the coastguard rescue helicopter with the hope of winching 
the yachtsman from the boat.

The vessel was eventually driven further up the beach 
by the tide where it could secured by coastguard officers.

An Eastbourne RNLI spokesman said: 
‘The drama started on Friday morning when the Eastbourne all-weather 
lifeboat was launched at the request of Dover Coastguard when it was 
apparent that a lone yachtsman was in difficulties off Bexhill. 

'Whilst
the lifeboat stood by, negotiations took place between coastguard 
officers and the skipper which eventually resulted in the lifeboat being
stood down, the skipper abjectly refusing all offers of assistance.

‘Eastbourne
all-weather lifeboat was scrambled and under way within a few minutes 
of the [Mayday] request to launch. Guided to the location by red 
distress flares fired from the yacht, the lifeboat was soon on scene.

'The yachtsman was then assisted through the surf and taken into the care of the police and ambulance.'

A police spokesman said: 'A man was detained under the Mental Health Act because he was deemed not to be of sound mind.

'He was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital before being taken into custody at Eastbourne at 8.14am to be assessed by a qualified medical practitioner.

East Sussex County Council have hired a security firm to ensure the safety of the boat until it can be collected on Monday.

A helicopter lit the scene while rescuers waded through the tide to help the stranded man

At high tide coastguards monitored the yacht but were unable to wade out to the vessel to aid the stranded man
