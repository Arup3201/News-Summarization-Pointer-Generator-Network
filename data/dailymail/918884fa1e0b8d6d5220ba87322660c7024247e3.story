George Osborne yesterday declared that ‘Britain is coming back’ after official figures showed the economy growing at its fastest pace for nearly seven years.

Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – rose by 0.8 per cent between January and March and was 3.1 per cent higher than in the same period of last year.

It was the first time since before the recession that the economy has expanded for five quarters in a row.

The UK economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the first three months of 2014, official figures show

Chancellor George Osborne said the latest growth figures were proof Britain is coming back

Experts said the economy was at last back ‘within shouting distance’ of its peak before the financial crash in 2007.

The figures left Labour’s Ed Balls floundering, resorting to jokes about Natalie Rowe, a former dominatrix photographed with Mr Osborne two decades ago, in the Commons.

The shadow chancellor conceded that growth was ‘finally’ returning but insisted: ‘Millions of hard-working people are still feeling no recovery at all.’

Mr Osborne revelled in pointing out that while Labour had forecast one million jobs would be lost if he trimmed public spending, in fact one and a half million more have been created.

The Office for National Statistics report yesterday showed the annual growth rate was the fastest since the end of 2007, and the economy is now on the cusp of surpassing its pre-crisis peak.

Independent analysts welcomed the news, with one saying the UK is in a ‘sweet spot’ and another saying ‘the economy is on fire’.

The Chancellor said the figures ‘show 
that Britain is coming back’ and said he was particularly encouraged 
that manufacturing rebounded more strongly than any other sector.

He
 said: ‘For the first time in a decade all three main sectors of the 
economy – manufacturing, services and construction – have grown by at 
least three per cent over the last year.

‘The impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad-based recovery are now in place.’

Despite the growth in recent months, the economy remains 0.6 per cent below its peak in ealry 2008

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ‘There is every sign that the recovery is starting to broaden out and I would describe our attitude as prudently optimistic.’

The International Monetary Fund has predicted Britain will be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world this year with growth of 2.9 per cent.

The Bank of England is expecting 3.4 per cent. GDP crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 under the last Labour government and is still 0.6 per cent smaller than it was before the crisis. But analysts believe it will make up the rest of the lost ground in the coming weeks.

Excluding oil and gas production – which has been in sharp decline for a number of years – output is already 0.3 per cent higher than before the crisis.

The ONS said the services sector grew 0.9 per cent between January and March, with output 3 per cent higher than a year ago.

Manufacturing output rose by 1.3 per cent – its best performance since the end of 2009 – and 3.4 per cent year-on-year.

Construction rose 0.3 per cent in the first quarter and was 5.1 per cent higher than a year ago.

Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ‘The UK economy is in the sweet spot of the economic cycle, with growth powering ahead of our major competitors and inflation falling away.

‘This is the Goldilocks moment for the UK economy, with growth neither too hot nor too cold.’
