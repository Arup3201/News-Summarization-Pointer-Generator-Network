They are the most precious moments of family life... and are meant to be private.

But these pictures of a baby in its cot and a tot being fed in a high chair are among images broadcast on a Russian website.

The site has hacked hundreds of security cameras in Britain connected to the internet.

Invasive: A baby being fed in a high chair are among images broadcast on a rogue Russian website

Private: A baby is seen in its cot on the website, which intercept and broadcast live pictures from homes

This allows it to intercept and broadcast live pictures from homes, gardens and driveways, and stream footage from workplaces, pubs, shops and gyms across the country. 

After the Daily Mail revealed the rogue website’s existence yesterday – and the data protection watchdog warned the public to protect their home CCTV and webcams from hackers – there was outrage around the globe at the invasion of privacy.

The site carries nearly 600 video feeds from homes and businesses in the UK, along with postcodes apparently showing the location. They are among more than 10,000 it has hacked worldwide.

Astonishingly, as the Mail revealed, the site – which crashed last night – features adverts sponsored by the British Government, meaning taxpayers are inadvertently paying to be spied upon.

The adverts are for an online security campaign, Cyberstreetwise.com, which is designed to encourage people to be safer online.

Last night ministers admitted it was ‘totally unacceptable’ for government adverts to appear on the site, and ordered that they be taken down.

Critics said the revelation was ‘almost beyond satire’.

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The public will just about accept that there is little that can be done to tackle these foreign hacking sites. The Government should absolutely know where public money is going and it certainly shouldn’t be helping to keep these sorts of sites active.’

Yesterday the Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, warned it may take some time to get the site shut down, because of where it is based.

He said images of children were unsettling and that it was up to parents to set up passwords to stop unauthorised remote access to cameras linked to the web.

He urged owners to change their passwords from manufacturers’ default settings so hackers could not break into them easily.

Mr Graham said he was working with foreign agencies to combat the site, which appeared to be using an Australian domain name bought via an American company.

He told BBC Breakfast footage of children in bed was ‘spooky’ but added: ‘It is the responsibility of the parents to set a proper password if you want remote access.’

Manufacturers said yesterday that the latest cameras gave users a warning if they did not change the default password.

Last night Minister for Organised Crime Karen Bradley said: ‘It is clearly totally unacceptable that advertising from the cross-government Cyber Streetwise campaign was placed on the Russian website. 

'We have instructed that it is removed immediately, and are investigating to understand how this happened and avoid any repeat.’
