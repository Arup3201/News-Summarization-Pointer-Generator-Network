A climber has died after plummeting 50 feet from a cliff edge into the sea as his girlfriend watched in horror.

The 32-year-old Wiltshire man had been scaling the rocks at a Dorset beauty spot when he lost his footing and fell 40 foot onto a ledge and then into the water.

A coastguard helicopter and two lifeboats were deployed to rescue the man, who was described as an experienced climber, from the sea below Dancing Ledge, near Swanage, Dorset.

He was flown to hospital but was pronounced dead just a short while later.

His family have been told of the climber’s tragic fall, which happened yesterday afternoon.

The man, who was visiting the area on holiday, had been traversing the cliffs at Dancing Ledge, a popular location for climbers on the Jurassic Coast.

The beauty spot on the Isle of Purbeck was featured in the BBC’s 2008 adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s novel Tess of the D’Ubervilles which starred Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne.

Climbers flock to the picturesque location because it boasts a small 10 metre high cliff close to the sea and a larger 20 metre high limestone cliff set a little way back from the smaller drop.

'On the afternoon of Thursday, August 23 Dorset Police and the coastguard were called to the scene of a climbing accident at Dancing Ledge, near Swanage,' said Inspector Debbie Martin.

'An experienced climber, the 32-year-old male visitor was in company with his girlfriend when the incident occured.

'The male was recovered from the sea and flown to Dorchester hospital but unfortunately died shortly after.

'The male's next of kin have been informed.'

Dave Turnbull, from the Swanage RNLI, said: 'We put a crew member into the water with a line and a knife so he could reach the person and cut him free from his climbing ropes.

'The casualty was then lifted into the lifeboat and the crew began CPR.

'While this was happening the lifeboat was gently motored out to sea to give more room for a transfer of the casualty via helicopter.

'Sadly the climber was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at hospital.

'The thoughts of the whole team at Swanage RNLI are with his family and friends at this very sad time.'
