Manchester City’s £200million state-of-the-art Football Academy opened this week to a flood of questions about whether they will succeed in producing any homegrown players, and more specifically will they develop any young players who will go on to play for England.

When Micah Richards left in the summer it felt like a part of Manchester City’s soul was dying.

Let’s remember this is a club with a proud history of producing its own players. The Youth Cup-winning side of 1986 has a special place in the hearts of City fans, with players like Andy Hinchcliffe, Ian Scott, Steve Redmond, Paul Lake, Paul Moulden, Ian Brightwell and David White all progressing to the first team.

Some helped City get back into the top flight, some even played in one of City’s greatest ever victories – 5-1 over Fergie’s big-spending Manchester United in 1989. Hinchcliffe and White all went on to play for England, while the brilliant Lake was in Bobby Robson’s provisional 30-man squad for the 1990 World Cup, before injuries curtailed his career.

Those were special times for City fans who, like supporters of most clubs, love to see a young, local player come through the system and play for the first team.

On opening this new academy, Manchester City have set themselves a target of producing four to six homegrown players for the first team. And the sceptics are questioning whether that will ever happen.

Who the hell do these sceptics think they are?

Sheikh Mansour has sanctioned not just a huge fortune on the building of this academy for Manchester City Football Club. He has demanded the very best facilities – there is a room in this building where at the push of a button conditions can be replicated from anywhere in the world at any time of year.

He is providing young hopefuls with the best conditions to succeed, and the best chance of getting a decent education while they’re chasing the football dream.

Perhaps even more importantly the Sheikh’s money is regenerating part of east Manchester and reducing unemployment with 70 per cent of the workforce taken on since the project's inception drawn from the local area, and 10 per cent of the staff previously unemployed.

Sheikh Mansour's vision for City is being realised, and his quote from six years ago is emblazoned on the entrance to the CFA

It is a massive boost for football in Manchester, and for the economy of the area. It’s not the FA responsible, and it’s not the government. It’s a man from the United Arab Emirates.

So instead of posing hypothetical questions about how many homegrown players will be in City’s first team in five years time, people should say thanks to Shiekh Mansour for what he’s given to Manchester City Football Club and to the city of Manchester.

Sure City have set themselves a target they know some will judge them on – Bayern Munich do the same. Their policy every year is to try to produce three players for their first team, three good enough for the Bundesliga, and three good enough to be professionals lower down the ladder. If that doesn’t happen have they failed? No of course not.

Instead of hypothetical questions, people should thank Shiekh Mansour for what he's given to the City of Manchester - including the Premier League title, clinched by Sergio Aguero in 2012 

Same applies to Manchester City. As an owner, Sheikh Mansour cannot be faulted. As a club, City are getting so many things right.

They have the ambition to produce players for the first team, and if it happens some of them will be English. Cynics want to knock it down already.

Not me. I’m too busy admiring a club and an owner trying to make English football and English society better.
