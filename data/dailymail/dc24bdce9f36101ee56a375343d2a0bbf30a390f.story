Marc-Andre Ter Stegen admits he's convinced that Real Madrid will slip-up in the title race and that Barcelona just need to keep on winning games to catch them.

The Catalonia side trail Carlo Ancelotti's men by one point coming into the second half of the season and have won four La Liga games on the bounce. 

Ter Stegen believes that if they carry on winning games, then Madrid will slip up at some point.

The German goalkeeper has found game time hard to come by but is still focused on winning the La Liga title

'In the league we hope Madrid stumble, which they surely will do. To stay in the title race we have to keep winning our games,' Ter Stegen told the official Barcelona website.

'We have to stay focused. We've also shown that we can be tough on defence if necessary.'

The German stopper, who is yet to establish himself as the clubs number one ahead of Claudio Bravo, believes that his side also has the ability to end the season with a treble. 

'In the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, luck certainly is a factor; we have to make our own luck.

'I think if we keep playing well defensively, we have a shot at succeeding in all three competitions.'
