Miami heat player LeBron James announced in July that he's going back to Ohio to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He'll be selling his opulent Florida mansion in the process.

LeBron James will no longer be living in South Florida so he's putting his Coconut Grove mansion back on the market for the hefty amount of $17 million. He'll be migrating back to his home near Akron in Ohio that measures up to 35,440 square-feet and only cost him $2.1 million when he bought it in 2003.

The luxurious Florida mansion for sale is 12,178 square feet and has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an infinity pool, and docks that can host two 60-foot yachts, writes The Bleacher Report.

Home again : Miami Heat player LeBron James is going home to his native Ohio to win the Cleveland Cavaliers the title he think they deserve and he'll be selling his Florida mansion in the process 

 Party anyone?: The 12,178 square foot home lights up at night and can host guests in any of the six bedrooms

White hot: The pristine white exterior of the home was hot enough for Miami Heat player LeBron James and could be for buyers if they can shell out the $17 million

Infinite luxury: The home has an infinity pool that when inside it's impossible to tell where the 12,178 square-foot end or begins 

Fit for a movie star: LeBron's stomping pad has its very own movie theater great for watching movies, especially if you buy the home and are starring in them 

No wine-ing here: The wine cellar in the home is a wine lover's dream but in order to won it they need to cork out a large sum of money

Swimming in it: Those wishing to afford the $17 million home will have to spend quite a bit of dough 

NBC reports that the mansion houses a movie theater, a guest home, an office, and a kitchen just for a chef, a three car garage, a waterfront pool along with a deck and a massive wine cellar.

Those who want to call the Coconut Grove player's pad their own will have to contact Tomi Rose of Opulence International Reality.

The listing agent knows the needs of pro-athletes when buying a home or at home since coincidentally she is engaged to ex Miami Heat player Mark Strickland.

As for LeBron's move, the player has said that he has a relationship with his hometown of Ohio that he cannot forget and he wants to go back and bring them the title he believes they deserve.

Four years ago when LeBron left Ohio he was viciously criticized by his peers and by fans. 

Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert called LeBron a coward, a narcissist, and a quitter when he decided to make the move.

Now the tables have turned and LeBron wants to payback his Ohio team for all the inspiration that they gave him.

'Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was a kid from Northeast Ohio. It's where I walked,' James told Sports Illustrated. 

'It's where I ran. It's where I cried. It's where I bled. It holds a special place in my heart. People there have seen me grow up. I sometimes feel like I'm their son. Their passion can be overwhelming. But it drives me.'

He's been quoted as saying that he originally went to Florida to win championships but now he believes he can take Cleveland up the ranks with him.

'My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what's most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio,' he told Sports Illustrated.

LeBron may be going home, but he isn't taking the $17 million mansion with him.

Instead he'll be living in a similarly plush home in The Bath Township right outside of Akron in Ohio.

The’ 35,440-square-foot  house has a theater, bowling alley, casino and barber shop and when he bought it cost $2.1 million when he bought it in 2003.

What's cooking?: Let's face it, with a kitchen like this the owner won't have to turn on the stove since the home also has a private chef's kitchen for all those hungry needs 

Greenery:Those wanting the purchase the home should also hire a gardener to keep the outside looking lush

Perfect for boat lovers: The home has a dock that can fir up to two 60-foot yachts and is perfect for a boat party

Make it rain: Those who want to afford the home with a luxurious bathroom such as this one will need to shower the real estate agent with $ 17 million 

Hello sunshine: If you have $17 million you can wake up and look at this beautiful view from your own home

Clean wardrobe: With laundry right in the home you can keep your garb clean even after hours of sweating during basketball practice or dancing the night away in an exclusive night club 

Welcome to paradise: The home is definitely fit for a player, a movie star, a king or even a kingpin with all of the luxuries it has to offer 

LeBron's Ohio mansion: Life's not too difficult when you have to sell one mansion just to return to another one, especially when it's less expensive and twice the size
