Shaun Wright-Phillips has been offered the chance to resurrect his career out on loan in the Championship – but has refused to leave QPR, according to manager Harry Redknapp.

Wright-Phillips, who is estimated to earn £65,000 per week, has played just 78 minutes of football this season during the Capital One Cup defeat away at Burton Albion and has been told by Redknapp he can leave Loftus Road.

The midfielder claims he went to Redknapp and asked what he needed to do to get a chance in the team and how he could improve, but says the discussion turned heated and they ended up rowing.

Blackburn, Bolton and Charlton are all understood to have been interested in signing the 33-year-old – only for the midfielder to turn down the chance to leave QPR.

Redknapp said: ‘We've offered Shaun the chance to go out on loan, but he's not wanted to go. I think he needs to move on and play - I've told him that many times.

‘You have opinions on your players, some you want and some you don’t that is the way the football world goes round.

‘We had clubs come in who have wanted to loan him and he has not wanted to go out on loan. So he is still here.

‘He trains hard. But he's not going to move when he's on a fantastic contract.

‘It is not the boy's fault. If someone wants to give you a lot less money you're not going to move are you? Blackburn, Bolton, maybe Charlton, they've come in for him and he didn't want to know. He doesn't want to go on loan.’

Responding to Redknapp's claim that Wright-Phillips would not leave the club on loan, the 33-year-old insisted he still had something to offer his manager in the second half of the season.

'I'm not at QPR to go back and forth. I'm fit and ready to do my bit in this relegation fight as they may need me at some point. I believe in myself and know what I'm capable of,' Wright-Phillips wrote on social networking site Kicca.

Ian Wright, Shaun's adoptive father, hit back at Redknapp's claims that his son was motivated by money.

'Ridiculous statement about not wanting to go on loan!!! You get paid the same money when you're on loan,' the former Arsenal striker tweeted.

Former Chelsea and Manchester City wide-man Wright-Phillips revealed he tried to talk to Redknapp about the situation to find out how he could improve his chances of reclaiming a place in the first team.

'I just want to play football. I don't want any QPR fans to feel I am short-changing them,' Wright-Phillips said in an interview with the Sun on Friday.

'I went to see Harry but it didn't go as I was hoping. I don't know if he thought I was going in for an argument but it certainly wasn't that and it got a bit heated.

'I just wanted to know what I could do better, how I could improve, just advice really. I didn't expect to be sworn at.' 

Redknapp also fought off speculation that defeat by Manchester United on Saturday could cost him his job.

QPR are 19th in the Premier League and without an away win all season, but Redknapp says he wants to carry on fighting to keep the club in the top flight.

The 67-year-old boss claims to have a great relationship with the club's hierarchy

He added: ‘I have a great relationship with the chairman and shareholders. It is their decision, if they decide they want to go in a different direction then that is up to them.

‘They have given me great support and I have loved every minute of my time here and I want to stay.

‘But it is their decision, I can’t lose any sleep over it. I spoke to Tony (Fernandes) this week and he has not suggested anything like that. And until he does I’ll keep doing what I do.

‘I will keep trying to win football matches. We have been playing well at home and if we had beaten Swansea here when we were 1-0 up two minutes into injury time then we would be sitting higher up the table. That’s how close it is. We are all stuck down there, one win can take you up five places and a defeat can drop you down four or five places as it did with us. We just have to keep going.’

Redknapp is not worried about his QPR job ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday
