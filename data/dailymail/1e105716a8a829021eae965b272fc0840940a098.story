Floyd Mayweather Jnr has fired a warning to Manny Pacquiao that he will be entering a whole new league when the two boxing giants finally collide in Las Vegas.

The $250millon (£160m) mega fight that the entire boxing world has been calling for was announced late on Friday night with the bout confirmed for May 2 at the MGM Grand.

The war of words between the fighters has already started with Manny Pacquiao taking to Instagram to prove that his was the first signature on the contract, insisting that the delay in the announcement was down to Mayweather.

The American has hit back at Pacquiao by claiming the Filipino has never fought anyone of his standard during his illustrious 64-fight career. 

'I think he's a very exciting fighter,' Mayweather told Fight Hype's Ben Thompson. 'I think he's also strong, but I think that this is a different league.

'I mean, this is a guy (Mayweather) that can box going forward, this is a guy that can box going backwards, a guy that can counterpunch, I can tie you up, I can slug if I have to, but my thing is always working smarter, not harder.'

Pacquiao produced an impressive display to beat Chris Algieri by unanimous decision in his last fight in November but Mayweather took a swipe at the Pac-man's opponent, claiming he isn't even a proper boxer.

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November

'He must know that he's not in there with, um, I don't know the guy's name, Algieri, the guy he just faced. That's a kickboxer he was fighting, the last guy, from what I was told. He's fighting a legitimate welterweight.'

Mayweather will enter the ring with Pacquiao in May having never lost a professional bout and the Money-man insists this gives him a psychological edge over his opponent, who has been beaten five times. 

'The only thing I know is to win, so is losing in the back of his mind? Absolutely! Why? Because he probably lost 3 or 5 times before, so losing is in his mind. Losing is not in my mind because the only thing I know how to do is win.'
