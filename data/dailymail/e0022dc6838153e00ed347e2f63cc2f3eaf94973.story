Cristiano Ronaldo posted a picture of himself smiling alongside his son Cristiano Jr. on his official Twitter account as he continued his recovery from a thigh injury ahead of the World Cup.

Ronaldo missed Portugal's World Cup warm-up game against Greece and was badly missed, with the game finishing goalless.

Real Madrid team-mates Fabio Coentrao and Pepe also missed the game, while former Liverpool and Chelsea midfielder Raul Meireles was another absent regular.

Portugal captain Ronaldo remains a doubt for their opening fixture in Brazil against Germany on Monday, June 16.

After the game against Greece, Portugal coach Paulo Bento warned that his side have to be able to cope with the loss of star names.

'In the first half we clearly deserved to be ahead and, apart from the last few minutes when we were worn out, we always had control of the game.

'We have to be prepared and we have to be able to play without players who are our first choices.'
