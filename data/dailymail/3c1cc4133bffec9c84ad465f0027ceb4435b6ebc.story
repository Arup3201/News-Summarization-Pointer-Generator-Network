Ralph Lauren was spotted taking his new $769,000 sports car for a spin near his home in the Hamptons over the weekend.

The 73-year-old, who is America's richest fashion designer with a net worth of $7billion according to Forbes, was seen behind the wheel of a silver  RUF CTR-3 Clubsport.

German-based RUF Automobile confirmed to MailOnline that he ordered the model - described as Porsche 911 'on steroids' - in March and it was delivered to New York's JFK airport by cargo plane.

A spokesman for the manufacturer said: 'The limited-production car has a 777 horse power, so it was transported in a Lufthansa Boeing 777, which everyone thought was great.'

Mr Lauren, who splits his time between New York and East Hampton in Long Island, dressed in all black and donned a pair of dark sunglasses as he drove solo.

The flashy ride has a top speed of 238mph and goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.

Mr Lauren is a big motor enthusiast and has established himself as one of the worldâ€™s top collectors.

In 2011 he unveiled an impressive 
collection, including a 1938 Bugatti, a 1958 Ferrari Testa Rossa and a 
2010 Lamborghini Murcielago, as part of a special exhibit in Paris 
called 'The Art of the Automobile: Masterpieces from the Ralph Lauren 
Collection.'

At his Long Island home he has a number of garages and workshops to house his stash of cars. He also employs a driver to take each one out every six weeks to ensure they are in running order.

Mr Lauren previously told Auto Week that he prefers to keep a low profile when out on the road.

'Strangely enough, I really don't like to drive the cars when people are around,' he said.

'I don't really want to be seen in 
the cars. There's a part of me that likes the privacy, so the more 
garish the car, the less I want to drive it.

'I never cared about being a collector. It was not my goal. Cars were always something that I loved.

'It was also about the famous owners and the men who built the cars. I was fascinated reading about what Enzo Ferrari was like, what Ettore Bugatti was about, and getting a sense of why they built these cars and what their lives were like. It's the lifestyle, the romance, all of those things together.'

The father-of-three was revealed at the 166th wealthiest person in the world by Forbes this spring.

He has a home on Fifth Avenue, New York, beach resorts in Jamaica and Montauk, Long Island, and a 17,000-acre Range in Colorado where he keeps about 20 Jeeps and pickups.
