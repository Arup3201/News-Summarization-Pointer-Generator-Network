Argos has apologised to a young job applicant after a staff member wrote on his CV that he was ‘stupid’ and posted a photograph of it on a social media site.

Shuhel Ahmed, 18, sent his CV to a south London outlet of the retail giant after moving to London on his mother’s advice due to the lack of jobs near his home in Cowes, Isle of Wight.

The résumé was later posted on Instagram with the words: ‘Check mans grades(sic)?! this guy is stupid lol’ written next to his GCSE exam results.

The family complained to Argos that it was ‘extremely angry and upset’.

Shuhel’s mother Helen Begum, 42, said: ‘This is something really evil. My son is really depressed. He is now scared to hand his CV around because it could happen again. He has lost his self-confidence.’

Argos, insisted that it did not tolerate bullying and the unnamed staff member responsible has resigned from its Walworth Road store.

But a spokesman added that since then Shuhel ‘has not been put forward for a role at the store’.
