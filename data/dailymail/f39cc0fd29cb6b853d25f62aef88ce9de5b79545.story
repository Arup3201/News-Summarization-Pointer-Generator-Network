The devastated girlfriend of murdered Sydney student Jamie Gao has flown home to Japan following a memorial service at the weekend.

Misaki Takebayashi left the country so she could grieve with family and friends overseas, but not before saying goodbye to her 'baby' in Australia.

Along with some close friends who accompanied her, Ms Takebayashi threw flowers into the water at the Cronulla site where Gao's body was found, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

She also released a heart-shaped note into the waves, and paid tribute to her slain lover on social media alongside a photo of a pendant with a photo of her and Mr Gao inside.

The couple had been dating for 'a few months' but Gao had apparently been smitten with his girlfriend for some time before they became a couple.

Last week Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her.

An intimate memorial service was held in Canterbury in Sydney's south-west at the weekend for the 20-year-old.

Police allege Mr Gao was murdered on Tuesday May 20 after a high-stakes drug deal went wrong.

They say he was wading 'in over his head', and the afternoon ended with the university student being shot twice in the chest, his body wrapped in a blue tarpaulin before being dumped into the ocean off Cronulla.

A body found floating off Shelly Beach a week later was formally identified as the 20-year-old student.

Mr Gao was reportedly in 'secret talks with police' in the weeks before he was killed, and had allegedly been called to give evidence before the Australian Crime Commission, the country's peak intelligence-gathering agency.

Two former police officers have been charged over the murder of UTS business student Jamie Gao

Federal police have publicly denied claims that the UTS Business student, who is thought to have been caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, was acting as an informant when he delivered $3 million of methamphetamine to former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara.

Police have alleged that before he was killed last month, he got inside a car with McNamara and Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby.

Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm.

Both McNamara and Rogerson were charged over the student's murder, refused bail, and are due to return to court in July.
