Walter Smith will end his self-imposed Ibrox exile on Tuesday night - after admitting that he elected to stay away from Rangers games while the battle raged for control of the troubled club.

Smith, who steered the Glasgow giants to nine league titles in a row, revealed that he got fed up of being accused of ‘taking sides’ in the Mike Ashley versus Dave King fight for the future of the financially-stricken outfit.

But days after Sports Direct tycoon Ashley prevailed in his bid to take control, Smith will be back cheering on Ally McCoist and his team against St Johnstone on Tuesday evening as they bid to reach the semi finals of the League Cup.

Smith handed the managerial reins to McCoist in 2011, but returned to the club as chairman in May 2013 only to quit less than three months later following a period of bitter in-fighting.

Explaining his non-attendance at matches since quitting as manager and then as chairman, the former Scotland boss said: ‘At first I didn’t go because I didn’t want people thinking I was - not interfering, exactly - but going to watch Alastair (McCoist) and the other boys I’d left there. That was initially my main reason for not going back.

‘But when (former chief executive) Charles Green asked me to go on the board I went back and going to games was another aspect of (the role).

‘But since I left the board, the reason I don’t go back is because is everybody keeps saying to me: ”You are supporting that side; or you are supporting the other side.” I thought: “I’m better off not bothering going.”

‘So I haven’t been to an awful lot of matches since I left. I watch the TV coverage and I read a lot about the club but I don’t go along to many games. But I do miss going to the games. I’ll go on Tuesday night to see how they do against St Johnstone.’

Smith was speaking as one of his Ibrox idols, Davie Wilson was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame alongside Leeds United legend Peter Lorimer, and former Celtic and Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas.

Capped 22 times for Scotland, Wilson - now aged 75 - played 227 games for Rangers as a winger.

He scored 98 goals for the Ibrox club before moving to Dundee United and Dumbarton – on each occasion teaming up with Smith who had previously cheered him from the Ibrox terraces as a boy.

‘I went to Ibrox and watched Wee Davie play in the late 1950s and early 1960s Rangers team,’ said Smith.

‘He also worked beside my old man when he was a boy, strangely enough.

‘At that time, Rangers had a fantastic team and it was an enjoyable period to go and watch them.

‘Davie was one of the main players and the number of goals he scored for a winger was fantastic.

‘Nowadays we don’t have wingers of that type.

‘Scotland were lucky back then because we had Peter Lorimer and Bobby Lennox who were similar types.

‘They were direct and they threatened the goal as much as they created opportunities for other players.

‘So Davie was a guy I really enjoyed watching as a boy.

‘He also came to play at Dundee United along with Jimmy Millar when I was a player at Tannadice and they were both fantastic professionals.

‘They could have tailed off at the end of their careers but they had a great attitude and it was great for a young player like myself to see that.

‘It was a big thrill for me. I’d never have imagined I would have played alongside Davie Wilson. He was terrific, so down to earth.

‘Then, later, Davie was assistant manager at Dumbarton when I went there for a year. We had a good young team at that time but unfortunately they all got sold. That stuff happened even back then.

‘Then Davie became a manager and he transferred me back to Dundee United!

‘But it’s great to see him inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. His family was there with him and it was great to see them share in the honour with him.’
