As Manchester United seal the £16m signing of Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo, it seems fitting to reflect on the club’s rather combustible previous associations with Argentine footballers. 

There have been only three - Juan Sebastian Veron, Gabriel Heinze, Carlos Tevez. 

One has been cast as one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s greatest misjudgments, another attempted to engineer a move to Liverpool and the third musketeer ended up at Manchester City.

United will hope that Rojo - whose surname in Spanish means ‘red’ or ‘fiery’ - will prove rather less problematic...

Juan Sebastian Veron

When did he sign? In the summer of 2001, United spent £28.1m on Argentine superstar Juan Sebastian Veron. Ferguson said:’What we have done is bring in a really top player, one of the best players in the world. He is world class - a fantastic footballer. Juan will bring a personality to the team which I feel we need at this moment.’

Delighted: Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for his new man Juan Sebastian Veron in 2001

How did it begin? Veron’s early form was impressive, as the Argentine scored against Bolton, Newcastle and memorably, the fourth goal of that famous comeback as United defeated Tottenham 5-3 at White Hart Lane. Watch back the showreels of Veron’s passing and finishing and you cannot dispute his talent.

What went wrong? Sadly, it also coincided with a nightmare season for United, in which Sir Alex Ferguson’s side had lost six matches before Christmas and sank to 9th in the table. He struggled to adapt to the rigours of English football, although some of his performances in Europe were outstanding. Two seasons on, as Roy Keane, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes continued to outshine the Argentine, Veron was sold to Chelsea for £15m.

Trouble: But it quickly went wrong for him as Manchester United struggle badly that season

What Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘Juan Veron was capable of exceptional football and was talented. But, at times, he found the Premiership a bit difficult. He was a European player and that was where we got our best form from him.’

What Veron said: ‘Ferguson trusted me when I first arrived. But later on it seemed we didn’t understand each other as well. There were times when I felt he preferred some of my team-mates.’

Gabriel Heinze

When did he sign? Now 10 years ago, Heinze was a £7m acquisition from PSG in the summer of 2004. Also signed that summer: Wayne Rooney, Gerard Pique and Giuseppe Rossi.

How did it begin? The Argentine made a promising start to life at Old Trafford, scoring on his debut at Bolton and named as the club’s Player of the Year at the end of his first campaign. Supporters admired his all-action, committed approach, flying down the left-flank from full-back.

What went wrong? Heinze suffered a serious injury at the beginning of his second season at United and in truth, he never really recovered. 

Patrice Evra was signed as cover in the January and the Frenchman established himself as Ferguson’s first-choice at left-back. The following season brought reduced opportunities and in the summer of 2007, Heinze demanded a move away from the club. A £6.8m bid came in from Liverpool and Heinze argued that United had agreed to sell him to any club that matched that valuation. 

Ultimately, the case went to a Premier League tribunal and Heinze even recruited Liverpool’s solicitor, Hill Dickinson, to work on his behalf. The Premier League ruled in United’s favour and Ferguson shipped Heinze out of the back door to Real Madrid.

What Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘A lot of fans will be asking what all this was about but it started a long time ago.

‘I was disappointed with Gaby from the time he joined us because he chose to play for Argentina in the Olympics in Athens in 2004 and didn’t come to us until the end of that September.

‘His first season was fantastic but the day before he got his bad injury his agent came to our hotel and asked if we could sell Gaby. After one year I thought it was an absolutely distressing signal to put out.

‘We allowed him to train in Spain and really he prepared to have himself fit to represent Argentina in the World Cup, which we couldn’t do anything about.

Glory: Heinze did have some good moments at Manchester United, including being named Player of the Year

‘We were not happy especially as he came back unfit from the World Cup.

‘Meanwhile all through that time his agents kept having meetings with (chief executive) David Gill asking to leave or double his money.

‘They wanted him to be the top-paid player, which is absolutely ridiculous given the quality of forward players we have.’

What Heinze said: ‘I am convinced Ferguson would not have given me a minute all season. I deserved better treatment after my efforts for the club. I thank the United fans - but they are very different to the directors.’

Has the relationship recovered? From the chants of ‘Arg-en-tina’ that Heinze was formerly greeted with by the Stretford End, it then became ‘You Scouse B*****d’ when the defender faced United with Marseille in 2011.

Heinze has since said: ‘I don’t have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them. I’m impulsive and strong-willed and this has got me into trouble at times, which was the case when I left United.’

Carlos Tevez

When did he sign? Carlos Tevez signed in the summer of 2007 on a complicated two-year loan deal after he arrived into English football with West Ham.

How did it begin? United won the Premier League and Champions League in Tevez’s first season at the club, as the Argentine formed a potent partnership with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. His indefatigable style appealed greatly to United followers.

Superstar: Carlos Tevez played for two seasons at Manchester United from 2007-09

What went wrong? The signing of Dimitar Berbatov limited opportunities and left Tevez a exasperated. United were slow to take up the option to sign Tevez permanently and speculation grew that he would leave the club at the end of the season for Liverpool or Manchester City. Eventually, he decided to leave and make one of the most controversial transfers in Premier League history to the Etihad Stadium.

What United said: ‘The club agreed to pay the option price of £25.5m and offered Carlos a five-year contract which would have made him one of its highest-paid players.

‘Disappointingly, however, his advisers informed the club that, despite the success he has enjoyed during one of the club’s most successful periods, he does not wish to continue playing for Manchester United.’

Glittering: He won two Premier Leagues and a Champions League during that time

What Sir Alex Ferguson said: In his autobiography, the former United manager wrote: ‘I brought Tevez on at half-time [in the 2009 Champions League final] and just felt he was playing for himself a little bit. From what I could gather, he had already made his mind up before joining City.

‘The rumour, not confirmed, was that our Manchester rivals had paid £47million. To me these were incredible sums. To me he was an impact player.’

What Tevez said: After Manchester City won the title in 2012, Tevez held up a sign that read ‘RIP Fergie’. He was quoted by the BBC to have told an Argentine publication: ‘It seems like Ferguson is the president of England. When he speaks badly about a player, nobody says he has to apologise but when someone comes out with a joke, you have to say sorry. I don’t say sorry. There’s no relationship at all between me and Ferguson.’

Preferred: The manager favoured new signing Dimitar Berbatov, which forced Tevez out of the door
