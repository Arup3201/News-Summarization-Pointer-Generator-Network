It was the holiday destination that supposedly inspired Dirty Dancing. But Grossinger's dancing days are over, the last guests have long since checked out, and the resort has been left to rot for 27 years.

The 1,200-acre Catskills resort was abandoned in 1986 - the year before the hit film, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey as a dance instructor and Baby Houseman, a holidaying teenager at the fictional Kellerman's, was released.

The hotel and grounds were part of the Borscht Belt, an area of New York state that was popular with holidaying Jewish families who faced discrimination elsewhere before cheap air travel meant trips abroad took off.

The likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Jackie Robinson stayed at the glamorous resort in its 1960s and 70s heyday. Now Grossinger's has descended into decay, with deckchairs, beds and salon hairdryers still standing.

A deckchair in the abandoned Jennie G hotel is now surrounded by foliage and moss, having been left untouched since 1986

Two fold-down beds and a framed painting remain in this guest room even though moss has taken over the floor and the ceiling is bare

A beauty salon lies derelict with the tall hairdryer still standing. It looks like the salon was inspired by Dutch artist Piet Mondrian's Composition paintings from the wall tiles that remain

The deserted lobby has since been used for graffiti while the walls have been left to rot

The hotel began as a small guesthouse with no plumbing or electricity in the 1900s, reports AbandonedNYC.com.

Austrian immigrants Asher Selig Grossinger and wife Malke moved to the Catskills from New York City, and Malke's incredible kosher cooking and their renowned hospitality meant they soon needed to expand.

In 1919, they bought a bigger house - Grossinger's Terrace Hill House - sat within 100 acres. The Grossingers' daughter Jennie was the resort's hostess and by the time of her death in 1972, she had transformed it into 35 buildings attracting 150,000 guests a year.

Grossinger's was famed for being the first place to use artificial snow for skiers in 1952. It had its own airstrip, ballrooms, auditoriums and sports grounds, hosting comedians and sporting champions and putting on nightly entertainment.

Its golf course remains open next to the abandoned site. Hotels International bought the resort in 1985 but could not reverse its fortunes when it came to declining visitor numbers who had given up the 100-mile journey to the Catskills from New York City in favor of air travel.

Now, the moss-covered walls and floors have become spots for graffiti and exploration as the overgrown shell of Grossinger's remains.

A summer at Grossinger's, a family destination popular with Jewish holidaymakers, was believed to have inspired Dirty Dancing. The film starred Patrick Swayze as a dance instructor at the fictional Kellerman's resort, with Jennifer Grey as Baby Houseman, a teenager who finds love and learns to dance during a long family holiday

Mold and moss has replaced the comfortable fittings and furniture of guest bedrooms at the site, which has been left alone for 27 years

Hotels International bought the 1,200-acre site in 1985 but failed to lure visitors back to the Catskills and closed Grossinger's a year later
