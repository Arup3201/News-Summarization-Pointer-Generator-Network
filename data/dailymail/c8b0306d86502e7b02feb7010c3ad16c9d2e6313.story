This Christmas, we'll spend an average of £100 to £299 on nine gifts for friends and family — and we'll spend the day itself watching TV instead of going to church, according to the results of a new YouGov poll.

The poll confirms Christianity's decline in Britain, with 67% of adults saying they won't attend a church service over the festive period.

According to last year's census returns, the number of British people who choose to call themselves Christians has fallen by more than four million.

No room for church services when it comes to the UK's Christmas day plans

The results of a recent YouGov poll show how much Christianity has declined in popularity

Just 5% plan to go to a church service on Christmas day itself, with 8% planning to go at some time during the festive period.

The most popular answer to the question 'What do you expect to be doing on Christmas day?' was the response 'Watch TV,' with more than three our of four of us planning to spend at least some time in front of the telly.

Other popular activities for the day include playing party games (35% of us plan on doing that), watching the Queen's Speech (31%), getting drunk (21%) and having sex (12%).

But Christmas carols are also falling out of favour, with only 41% of us planning to sing festive songs over the season. 

When it comes to buying presents, almost half of us will be hunting through shops for nine or fewer gifts — while just 3% plan to buy more than 50 presents.

All that gift giving adds up — and a third of us plan to spend £100 to £299 on gifts this year. About a fifth plan to spend £300 to £499, and 26% will spend £99 or less.

Few of us plan to take a loan out this December to pay for everything; just 7% will use a credit card or overdraft to pay for Christmas, and 55% of us plan to cover costs from our regular salary.

When it comes to spending money on Christmas dinner, there's an even split between thrifty eaters and those who want to splurge — 20% of us are planning to spend less than £20 on the festive feast, but an equal number of us plan to spend over £75.

YouGov also predicts that UK households will spend £835 on average celebrating Christmas this year. This figure is down slightly from last year, when the average cost  was £865 per family. Gifts for friends and family make up the bulk of the expense (£634), followed by food and drink (£161), and cards, trees and decorations (£40). The top three categories of Christmas gifts for UK consumers are books, clothing and music/DVDs.
