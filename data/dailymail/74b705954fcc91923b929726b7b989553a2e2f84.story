At the same time she released a video of the teenager playing the piano and singing one of her own songs, called 'Don't Let It Go Away'.

She said: 'We'd like to say to Alice first of all that we miss her, that we love her and that she's not in any trouble, and we want to know that she's safe. We just want her to come home.

'We're also appealing to anybody who might have seen her or who may have made contact with her or who may know something about her whereabouts to contact police or Missing People, and to just get in touch because we're really concerned about her well-being.'

Alice's sister Nina has also played a key part in the search and has set up a dedicated Facebook page to appeal for information as well as taking to Twitter using the hashtag #FindAlice.
