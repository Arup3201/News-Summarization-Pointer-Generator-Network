Angelina: 'I'm very similar to Maddox'

Angelina Jolie believes a child's personality is already defined at birth - 
remaining unaltered by the circumstances of their upbringing - and says 
she has more in common with her adopted son Maddox than her own genetic 
children.

The actress and mother of six said motherhood had taught 
her that children are 'who they are when they are born' and in the 
absence of a serious trauma will grow up to be their own person.

Jolie,
 38, who is engaged to Brad Pitt, said: 'I think children are exactly 
who they are when they're born. And if there is a trauma, it can 
drastically change who they are.

'If you look at baby photos of our 
kids, the way they were, the way they looked, what their energy was - 
whether they were a sweet, elegant, private little person, or a funny, 
open person, or a bold person - they're still the same.

'There's so 
much they are born with. And we believe you just have to encourage the 
individual and support them, but don't get in their way too much.'

Three
 of Jolie's children are adopted and she said she was surprised she had
 more  in common with adopted  son Maddox than her own genetic children.

'You'd think you'd be more similar to the children you have a 
genetic link with, but I'm not. Maybe one of them, but then I'm very 
similar to Maddox.

'So it doesn't have an impact that some are 
genetically connected.'

She added: 'We're hoping the kids don't 
become actors. We want them to do what they're interested in, but we're 
showing them so many other ideas they won't want to act.'
