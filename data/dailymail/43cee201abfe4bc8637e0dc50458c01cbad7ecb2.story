She might have millions of dollars in the bank, but Taylor Swift still hits the same clothing stores as most girls her age do.

The 24-year-old singer stepped out on February 13 in Hollywood wearing a $14.95 black-and-white polka dot dress from H&M - proving that it doesn't cost a fortune to look like a pop princess.

She teamed the cut-price purchase with a pair of tan wedged shoes and classic black Ray-Ban sunglasses.

Fans were quick to compliment Miss Swift on her affordable outfit.

'I like the way she dresses. Much more respectful of herself than some others in the spotlight,' one wrote.

Another added: 'She looks really good.'

Her jersey dress is currently still available on the H&M website, although size L has sold out.

It's not the first time the 5ft 10in star has worn clothes from the brand.

In 2011 she was spotted shopping in Paris
 on the European leg of her Speak Now tour looking pretty in a 
bird-print tea dress from H&M's spring line.

Her stylist, Joseph Cassell, claims to be a big fan of the label.

He told The Tennessean last year that he always wears H&M and their plaid shirts are his favorite.

'They have everything... basics, high fashion, it's all very affordable it's excellent.

'Their finger's right on the pulse of every trend... every season.'

Along with praising Miss Swift on her wardrobe choice, commentators also gave her new choppier hair cut a thumbs up.

She is currently in the midst of her third worldwide concert tour with the next stop being Omaha, Nebraska.
