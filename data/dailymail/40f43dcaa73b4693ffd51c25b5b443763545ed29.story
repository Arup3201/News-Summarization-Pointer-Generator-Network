A daughter who was left £2,000 by her dying father and a note which said 'do something good' has used the money to set up a charity which has helped 10,000 African entrepreneurs.

Vashti Seth, from St Werburghs, Bristol, was devastated when her father John Richards bequeathed personal gifts to each one of her six siblings, but left her out.

But the 37-year-old was later handed an envelope filled with cash and a handwritten note which simply read: 'Do something good with it'.

Vashti Seth, 37 (left), from St Werburghs, Bristol, used the £2,000 left by her father John Richards (right) to start a charity called Deki, which was inspired by a trip to India and has helped 10,000 African entrepreneurs

The mother of two was initially confused by its meaning, but after visiting a Tibetan orphan called Deki Dolkha - who her father had sponsored for many years in India - an idea struck her.

Inspired by the hardships faced by Deki, she created a charity that allowed people to financially help budding entrepreneurs in the world's poorest countries.

The organisation, named Deki, has now helped more than 10,000 people set up their own businesses and secure their future earnings with the crowd-funding website.

Generous lenders give small loans - of any amount - to those in need, who - after beginning their business and turning a profit - hand back the original loan money to investors. 

Ms Seth said: 'My dad passed away and when he did he left everyone something personal apart from me. There are seven of us in total.

'I was quite upset but then I realised he had left me £2,000 with a note saying "do something good with it".

'It took me a while to work out what he meant.

'The website helps people who want to set up a business, but who have no opportunity to do it. It's for hard working people who want the opportunity.

Esther, from South Sudan (pictured with her children) has been able to send all four of her children to school since taking out a Deki loan and increasing the profits of her business. She said 'I smile everyday now'

Mother-of-four Colline, 32, lost her home and possessions in the civil war in South Sudan. She used the loan from Deki to set up a small shop in her local village and now buys groceries and toiletries to sell on at a profit

Children in South Sudan have also benefited from loans, with parents able to feed them thanks to Deki money (left). Grace, 24, (right), from northern Uganda used the loan to help her grow and sell vegetable products

'You can lend money to people who want to help themselves, it's for things like buying a cow to a car to an irrigation system.

'We've estimated that every person we loan to makes a positive impact on five people for their children and family.

'In the end, this money that came from my dad has really helped to change lives.'

Ms Seth launched the charity in 2008 shortly after attending her father's funeral.

She was living and working in Australia in the film industry at the time but decided to move back to the UK and stopped off in India on her way home.

After discovering Deki wanted to start her own business, but had no means to do it, she decided to help her out - and her idea quickly flowed into a business.

'As I was going home to England from Australia I went to visit Deki,' Ms Seth added.

'I realised what she needed was the help to get her out of poverty, not just hand-outs as they're just short term help.

'That really got me thinking and I loved the idea of micro loans or small loans that could help people in need start their own business.

'With this in mind I thought that was a really, really good solution.'

The charity has now gone from strength-to-strength and in just six years it has loaned more than £350,000 to those in need.

Ms Seth said: 'We regularly have people writing in telling us how they are doing and it's so lovely to read, it makes the whole thing worthwhile.

'We recently gave £120 to one guy who was selling vegetables on the side of the road.

'With the money, he invested in a little stall and began selling things they didn't have in that area.

'He started selling toiletries and things and paid back the loan really quickly.

'He then took out another loan and opened a little hairdressers.

'In the two years since his first loan he has really had an impact on the community and his life.

'We get stories that people have been able to put tin on their roofs now and you think that's something so small to us, but it means so much to them.'

The loans have helped a range of people in African countries, including Esther, from South Sudan who has been able to send all four of her children to school since taking out a Deki loan and increasing the profits of her business. She said: 'I smile everyday now.'

Mother-of-four Colline, 32, who lost her home and possessions in the civil war in South Sudan, has also benefited from a Deki loan.

Halima Namutosi, a South Sudanese refugee living in exile in northern Uganda, has turned her life around thanks to a £240 Deki loan. She is  is now able to pay for school fees and moved her family to a better house

She used the money sent to her to set up a small shop in her local village and now buys groceries and toiletries to sell on at a profit.

Halima Namutosi, a South Sudanese refugee living in exile in northern Uganda, has also turned her life around thanks to a £240 Deki loan. She is is now able to pay for school fees and has moved her family to a better house.

And Grace, 24, from northern Uganda, used an £80 loan to help her grow and sell vegetable products, which has helped support her livelihood. 

The charity has now become so successful that Ms Seth has had to employ four people on a full-time basis at her office in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol and has an army of volunteers and trustees ready to help.
