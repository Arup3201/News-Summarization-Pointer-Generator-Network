Three men have died after their car collided with an articulated lorry on a busy dual carriageway.

A fourth man is in hospital in a critical but stable condition following the crash on the A10 between the Turnford and Hoddlesdon junctions in Hertfordshire yesterday. All the men are aged in their late teens or early twenties.

The accident happened on the northbound carriageway at around 2.15pm when their Vauxhall Corsa is thought to have collided with the rear of a Mercedes lorry.

Tributes: The boys (left to right) Jack Boyton, Ashley Jones and Harry Ferrand, were named on a Facebook group set up to commemorate them after the accident in which their car collided with an articulated lorry

Jack Boyton, Ashley Jones and Harry Ferrand were killed instantly while a third passenger, Liam Bradshaw, was taken to the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, by air ambulance with serious injuries. The driver of the lorry was not injured.

It is understood that the small car slammed into the back of the lorry, killing friends Jack, Ashley and Harry instantly.

Ambulance crews from Cheshunt, Melbourn 
and Welwyn Garden City attended the incident while the Hertfordshire Air
Ambulance was also sent.

Post mortem examinations on their bodies were expected to be carried out on Monday or Tuesday, when an inquest will also be opened and adjourned.

East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust spokesman Gary Sanderson, who was on the scene, said: 'First and foremost our thoughts are firmly with all of the families of the men involved in this tragic incident.

'Following a rapid scene assessment by paramedics at the scene, three men were pronounced dead shortly after.

'A fourth man, who was seriously injured, was treated by land and air ambulance crews, before he was flown to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel for further care.'

Hertfordshire Police said that close relatives of the victims had all been told of the tragedy.

A Facebook site has been set up in tribute to the crash victims and it has been flooded with tributes.

'Keep wishing it was just a bad dream,' said one girl. Others prayed for the remaining man in hospital to 'keep fighting'.

A friend of Jack's named Harry Turner wrote: 'RIP Jack you were such a lovely kid, some fantastic holidays and childhood memories were had with you.

'My thoughts are with your mum and sister. You were far too young to be taken! Rest peacefully.'

Sue Selim added: 'RIP, such young lives tragically take from this world way too soon, thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends at this deviating time.... heaven has gained more angels.'

Sgt Colin Jenkinson of Hertfordshire Police roads policing unit said: 'Three men have tragically died and one man has been seriously injured following this collision and we are providing support to their families at this difficult time.

Statement: The police confirmed three men tragically died and one more was sent to hospital - it later emerged he was in critical condition

'We are conducting a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the collision and are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident to get in contact as soon as possible.

'Perhaps you saw the vehicle just before the collision took place or maybe you saw something immediately after. Any information you provide could be crucial to our investigation.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.

Further tragedy stuck in Hertfordshire this morning when a pedestrian was hit and killed in the dark on a dual carriageway.

The man was believed to be walking 
home along the A505 to Baldock, when he was struck by a black BMW near 
Ashwell at around 5.30am on Saturday.

Investigators suspect he may then have been hit by a number of other cars as he lay dead or dying in the carriageway.

Another tragedy: On Saturday morning emergency services were called out again when a pedestrian was killed in a separate incident

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'It is believed the man was walking eastbound towards Royston between the two Ashwell junctions, when he was in collision with a Black BMW.

'A number of vehicles stopped at the scene, however it is believed further cars drove past and may also have been in collision with the victim.

'The man, who is believed to be aged in his 20s and from Royston, sadly died at the scene.'

The man driving the BMW stopped at the scene and has spoken to police. He was not believed to be injured. No arrests have been made.

Police appealed for information from anyone who might know anything about the crash, which happened near Slip End Farm.
