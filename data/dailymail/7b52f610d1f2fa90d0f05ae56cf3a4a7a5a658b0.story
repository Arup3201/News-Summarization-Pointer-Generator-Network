You would have thought that at least a handful of the 973,000 unemployed young people in Britain would have put their name forward for a £15,000-a-year apprenticeship at a luxury car dealership.

But one month after the sales job at a Mercedes-Benz showroom in Newbury, Berkshire, was advertised on apprenticeship websites as well as in job and community centres, nobody has applied.

The right person for the job needed to have been aged between 18 and 24 years, have an A-C in Maths and English GCSE as well as having an A-Level. A valid UK driving licence was also a must.

Position: One month after the job at a Mercedes-Benz showroom in Newbury, Berkshire, was advertised on websites for apprenticeship seekers as well as in job and community centres, nobody has applied

Interior: The job also offers commission and a bonus on completing a two-year qualification, as well as being the first step on the ladder with luxury national car chain Sytner, which runs the showroom

Mick Pilling, the recruitment director
for Remit, which was offering the apprenticeship, said: ‘We are a bit 
bewildered as to why we are not getting applicants for this position in 
Newbury.

‘There will be a 
lot of young people in Newbury thinking about their future over the next
couple of weeks. In other parts of the country these apprenticeships 
attract large numbers.’

Yesterday it was revealed that 
long-term and youth unemployment have increased, but the number of 
people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance has fallen to its lowest level for
more than four years.

Youth
unemployment, among 16 to 24 year olds, rose by 15,000 to reach 
973,000, while the number of people out of work for more than two years 
rose by 10,000 to 474,000, the highest since 1997.

Luxury: Sytner described the showroom as 'warm and very well-appointed' with 'coffee and water coolers'

Advert: The right person for the job needed to have been aged between 18 and 24 years, have an A-C in Maths and English GCSE as well as having an A-Level. A valid UK driving licence was also a must

The Mercedes
job offered commission and a bonus on completing a two-year 
qualification, as well as being the first step on the ladder with luxury
national car chain Sytner, which runs the showroom.

'We thought there would be a stampede. What are they all doing out there?'

Sytner spokesman

A
company spokesman admitted: ‘We were bewildered - we thought there 
would be a stampede but not one young person has come forward to apply.

'What are they all doing out there? We haven't had a single application 
despite advertising it on the National Apprenticeship website and in job
and community centres over a very wide area since July.

‘You'd think there would be at least one
youngster wanting to learn the trade, especially as it's in a lovely 
warm and very well-appointed showroom, coffee and water coolers, out of 
the wind, rain and cold with winter approaching.

Different: Sytner said today's car salesmen are 'a far cry from the Arthur Daley image of someone in a fur-lined jacket and trilby selling you a dodgy motor'. Daley was played by George Cole in TV comedy-drama Minder

The showroom's last apprentice, Andrew Keavney, 20, of Thatcham, Berkshire, confessed he was also astonished at the non-take up.

He said: ‘I've been here a year now 
and this apprenticeship has so far been fantastic. Sytner and Remit have supported me along the way and I'm enjoying
my job and the training itself.

‘Not only am I getting my 
qualifications and learning the role of a sales executive, I've been 
employed from day one and have a fantastic salary and benefits package, 
which doesn't compare to other apprenticeships.’

Newbury: Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that there were 340 people in West Berkshire aged between 18 and 24 claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month

Recent
statistics also revealed that in March 2013 the number of unemployed 
residents in West Berkshire had risen to 4,200 - 7.8 per cent of the 
district’s population - from 3,900 last March.

Apprenticeships have been championed by the Government as a way for young people to get trained and be in paid employment.

In March Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to make it the ‘new norm’ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university.
