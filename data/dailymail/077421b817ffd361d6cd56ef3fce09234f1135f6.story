Facebook mogul and fantasy superfan Sean Parker went to war against California officials over his elaborate wedding plans - and apparently scored a major victory.

The billionaire's over-the-top nuptials allegedly paying homage to Game of Thrones, which were expected to take place at the Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur June 1, hit a snag last week when Monterey County planning officials and the state Coastal Commission launched an investigation into possible violations of the building code.

Parker, 33, is marrying Alexandra Lenas, a 
singer-songwriter with whom he has a two-month-old daughter, Winter 
Victoria, after a two-year engagement.

The massive event, believed to be based on the hit HBO series, possibly with elements from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings thrown in, reportedly would include set designs incorporating fake ruins, waterfalls and bridges  - all to the tune of $10million

Back in action: The grounds of Big Sur's Ventana Inn were swarming with workers loading trucks with huge industrial generators, apparently in preparation for Sean Parker's nuptials

Brace yourselves: One observer said the wedding could turn into a 'Game of Thrones' fantasy re-enactment

The construction, however, appears to have drawn the ire of California Coastal Commission, which accused the organizers of erecting edifices on the site with the necessary permits.

“We have opened a code enforcement investigation on Ventana Inn,' 
Monterey County planning director Mike Novo told the Pine Cone.

Neither the Ventana or Parker or his representatives have applied for permits, 
Novo said. One of the wedding’s contractors promised county officials that 
everything would be torn down after the wedding.

Associate county planner Joseph Sidor said the state coastal commission is investigating as well.

On Monday, however, Monterey attorney Aengus Jeffers confirmed to the Monterey County Herald  that the lavish wedding plans were still on.

‘We are in frank, candid conversations with the county and the Coastal Commission staff,’ he said.

According to county spokeswoman Maia Carroll, the county's code enforcement case wouldn't be formally closed until the Coastal Commission reaches its conclusions.

Playing dress-up: For Halloween, Parker dressed as Justin Timberlake, who played him in the movie 'The Social Network.' Lenas went as Britney Spears

Parker, the founder of Napster, has 
hired Lord of the Rings costume designer Ngila Dickson to create outfits
for the guests, he said on Facebook.

The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls.

However, following the uproar over the permits, a source told MailOnline that the couple were 'strongly considering an alternate plan which would happen at
a different location in pebble beach'.

And the source added today: 'Sean is considering various options.'

On
Monday, however, the grounds of Ventana were swarming with workers 
loading trucks with huge industrial generators as security guards stood 
watch at the entrance to the 40-acre site, suggesting that Parker and 
Lenas decided to keep their wedding plans on track.

In 2011, the pair dressed as victims from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds'

Game of Thrones is a popular medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery.

Parker
is worth an estimated $2billion after becoming the founder of Napster 
and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark 
Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network.

He was portrayed in the 2008 movie 'The Social Network' by Justin Timberlake, though he has taken issue with how his character was portrayed.

Parker proposed to Lenas, a singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Winter Victoria Parker.

The fantasy wedding won't be the first time the the couple has played dress-up together.

They have been pictured during previous Halloween parties dressed as Justin Timberlake and Brittney Spears and as a gruesome duo from the Alfred Hitchcock film 'The Birds.'

Meanwhile, this week it was revealed Sean and Alexandra are now living at the Plaza hotel in New York while their Greenwich Village townhouse is being renovated - and will be there for more than a year.

A spokesman for Sean declined to comment.
