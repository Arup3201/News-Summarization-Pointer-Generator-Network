It is a problem which will be familiar to many parents: how to curb junk food.

Today David Cameron lifted the lid on his own battle to stop his three children drinking too many fizzy drinks.

Speaking in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said he was trying to stop 'excessive' amounts of Coca-Cola being consumed in the Cameron household amid calls for a 'war on sugar'.

Mr Cameron said the government was putting pressure on the food industry to cut the amount of sugar in food and drinks, branding it one of the biggest public health challenges facing in the country.

He added: 'That is why we challenge business through our responsibility deal to 
try to reduce levels of sugar and that has had some effect.

A can of Coke contains up to eight teaspoons of sugar, the Commons was told

'Frankly, this is one of those health challenges that is not just a 
challenge for the health service, it is a challenge for local 
authorities for schools and for parents as well.

'And as someone trying to bring up three children without excessive 
amounts of Coca-Cola, I know exactly how big this challenge is.'

Mr Cameron and wife Samantha have three children, Nancy, aged eight, Arthur, six, and Florence two.

As Tory leader, he famously spoke out against 'irresponsible' shops fueling Britain's health problems.

'As
Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith's promote half-price
Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?' he said in
2006.

Today he was 
challenged in the Commons by Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has diabetes and 
called for steps to reduce childhood obesity, warning it could leave the
next generation with a diabetes epidemic.

He said more should be done to curb the amount of junk food and drink available to young people, fearing obesity will lead to diabetes later in life.

Mr Vaz said: 'One third of all primary school leavers are either obese or they are overweight, yet they consume cans of Coke and Pepsi that contain up to eight teaspoons of sugar.

'What steps are you proposing to take to engage manufacturers in a war against sugar?

'If we don't act now, the next generation will be overwhelmed by a diabetes epidemic.'

The exchanges followed calls from Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham for a 30% cap on the level of sugar in some popular breakfast cereals - which would ban brands such as Frosties, which has 37g of sugar per 100g.
