Eleven years after their adoptive father was bludgeoned to death by their mother's lover in the Hamptons, the Ammon twins have spoken out for their first time about the torment they endured.

In a new documentary, Greg and Alexa Ammon have revealed the moment they learned of the death of their multimillionaire financier father, Ted, and how they were wooed by the man who killed him.

'We loved the guy who killed our father,' Greg, now 22, says of Danny Pelosi, who is serving life in prison for the murder. 'But Danny was and still is a pure psychopath.'

Three years after the murder, the twins, who had been adopted by the couple from a Ukrainian orphanage, were left without parents for a second time when their mother died from breast cancer.

Moving on: Adopted twins Greg and Alexa Ammon, now 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered following the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001

In the film, which premiered at the East 
Hampton Cinema on Friday, they revisit these painful years and also return to their hometown in
the Ukraine to meet their long-lost biological 
family.

There, they learn that their biological mother's life was also plagued with problems. She prostituted herself to be able to fund her alcoholism and suffered with a mental illness.

The revelations come more than a decade after Ted Ammon's murder and the sordid affair between his wife and Pelosi played out in the pages of newspapers and a made-for-television movie.

Ammon, 52, was found naked and 
bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of his home on October 22, 2001, as he fought a bitter divorce and custody 
battle with his estranged wife, Generosa.

The twins, who were 11 at the time, recalled the moment they learned of his death in their documentary, 59 Middle Lane.

Saved: The children had been adopted by the wealthy couple from an orphanage in the Ukraine

'You wake up in the morning, get dressed
like a normal day and Aunt Sandi comes in, and Aunt Sandi, of course, 
lives in Alabama, and we are like why are you here,' Greg recalled.

At the time of his death, the Ammons had not finalised their divorce and Ted had yet to re-write his will, leaving his estranged wife with half of his fortune, estimated to be around $80 million.

In the film, which was directed by Greg, they reveal they are making the documentary for closure.

'I feel like I want to put an end to all the horrible things that happened,' he says.

'Bringing the film back to the Hamptons 
and premiering it in the same theater I went to as a kid will be very 
emotional and, hopefully, therapeutic,' he added to The East Hampton Press
 before it opened.

'I wanted to humanize [my parents], give them a face through my eyes. Although I knew I couldn’t shy away from what happened, I wanted the focus to be on what truly mattered; the incredible gift my parents gave Alexa and I when they adopted us.'

They revisit the family home, which they still own, in the film, and recall the months of emotional abuse from their mother as their parents went through their divorce.

She would make them steal documents 
from their father and then allow them to watch television as a reward. 
But if they said they had had fun with him, they would be sent directly 
to their room.

'I remember Mom, but all I remember are the bad things,' Greg says in the film.

Three
months after Ted Ammon was murdered, Pelosi divorced his wife and 
married Generosa. They lived in Ammon's mansion before moving to 
Pelosi's home in Long Island.

Generosa had little time to enjoy her former husband's wealth, however, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama.

Pelosi, who had been battling for a 
part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in 
March 2004 and was found guilty of murder.

He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031.

When they faced him in court, aged 14, the twins were unforgiving towards the man they once loved.

'I hope you suffer and go through 
just as much as my sister and I have,' Greg said at his sentencing, the New York Post reported. 'I just hope God can forgive you, because I certainly won’t.'

Roots: They return to the Ukraine, where they learn that their biological mother was a prostitute

Reunion: Greg and Alexa also meet long-lost relatives including three biological siblings

'It's hard to realise that the person 
you loved stabbed you in the back and ruined the rest of your life. You 
are a sick man, and I regret every single time I said I loved you.'

His sister added: 'Mr. Pelosi might have had a nice time 
for the past couple of years spending my parents' money, but that is 
over now, and I hope he rots away in prison because he deserves nothing 
better.'

The bereft twins, who inherited $1 
million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, decide to use the 
opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family.

Searching
through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the 
orphanage in the Ukraine, from where they were adopted as malnourished 
children.

They learn that they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she struggled with alcoholism and mental problems.

She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. 
She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins.

The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow.

'Ultimately, that story in the 
Ukraine is very similar to our story in America,' Greg told The East 
Hampton Press. 'When I’m speaking about our birth mother, I’m speaking 
about my adopted mother, too. I try to tell both of their stories.'

The film has already premiered at the 
East Hamptons movie theatre and is scheduled to be shown again at Jazz 
at Lincoln Center, of which Ammon had been a longtime supporter.
