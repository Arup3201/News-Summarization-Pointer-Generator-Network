A boxer who threatened Muslims with acts of ‘insane violence’ on Facebook hours after Drummer Lee Rigby was hacked to death was jailed for four months today.

Tony Perrin, 27, was arrested near his south London home after he posted his threats with a photo of himself wearing a balaclava and pointing a gun at the camera.

Perrin, who used a Facebook page in the name of ‘Tony Croydon’, wrote on May 22 this year, just after the Woolwich execution: ‘I will do a lot worse than what took place yesterday and I have like minded people behind me’.

In the post, Perrin encouraged his ‘fellow countrymen’ and ‘my beloved EDL’ to follow his lead.

He said: 'You Muslims aren’t the only people that make explosives and your (corr) not the only people willing to commit acts of insane violence.

He concluded his message with hate with a variation on the EDL slogan, ‘Never surrender’, adding: ‘Revenge will be taken!’

The judge conceded that ‘what happened in Woolwich a few weeks ago shocked the whole nation’ but he said Perrin’s case was ‘abhorrent’.

Jailing Perrin for four months Judge Clark said the aggravating factors were his ‘glorification of firearms’ and the incitement of ‘revenge attacks’.

Perrin admitted that the handgun was only a BB gun and that he was drunk when he made the offensive post.

He had also engaged with a Muslim online soon afterwards - a conversation which led him to take down his post.

But by this time it had already gone ‘viral’ and the damage had been done.

Perrin lost his job as a scaffolder as a result of the publicity surrounding the case. the court heard.

Shameful: This is the grossly offensive message Perrin posted on Facebook in the 24 hours after Drummer Rigby died, which led to him being jailed today

His
previous convictions include possession of an imitation firearm with 
intent to commit an indictable offence, dishonesty and attempted 
robbery.

But despite his support for the far 
right group, it emerged at West London Magistrates Court that EDL 
supporters have accused Perrin of ‘damaging the cause’.

Perrin’s
solicitor told the court that he ‘has had telephone calls from members 
of the EDL threatening him and telling him if he goes to prison he will 
be assaulted’.

The 
reasons for the EDL threats are unclear but a page from the EDL news 
reads: ‘As much as we are saddened by yesterday’s news from Woolwich, we
feel it is more important than ever to keep tabs on extremists on the 
far right.

Emblem: Tony Perrin used this picture showing his apparent links to his 'beloved EDL', but members of the group have since threatened him because he is damaging their cause, the court heard

‘Meet Tony Munday aka Tony Perrin from Croydon. A boxer who posts pictures of himself with a gun.

‘If
that is not worrying enough he posts the below on his Facebook page 
where he threatens to make a bomb and go on a killing spree.

‘This has been reported to the Met Police’s Counter Terrorism Unit.’

Speaking
to Radio 4’s Today programme this week, EDL leader Tommy Robinson said:
‘Every single speech I gave since Woolwich, in fact in the last four 
years, condemn any acts of violence. So the only way to solve this is 
through democratic process, through peacefully protesting.’

When
it became clear that District Judge Paul Clark intended to pass a jail 
sentence today Perrin visibly paled and said: ‘I haven’t done anything 
wrong. They tried to cut someone’s head off and I posted something 
online. They want to send me to prison?

‘What jail is he going to put me, bearing in mind there are Muslims in all of them’, he added.

Perrin, of Norbury, South London, admitted posting a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to the Communications Act 2003.

He has already served half of the sentence and will be elligble for release in a month.
