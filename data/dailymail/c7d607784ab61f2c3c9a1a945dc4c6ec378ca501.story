The Ferrari was the star attraction among the many items put up for the auction by the Maranello company.

Under the bonnet is a V12 engine which develops a staggering 740bhp to make it one the ultimate track cars.

It is such a hardcore, no-holds barred machine that it is not allowed to be used on road or in specific race series.

Instead, ultra-rich owners tend to leave them to be looked after by Ferrari and brought out three-times a year for special manufacturer days.

Luca di Montezemolo described the auction as a 'pole position result', praising the 'big heartedness' of the Ferrari fans who took part in the bidding.

He added: 'I would like to thank all the clients, collectors and enthusiasts that did their bit.

'Their bids have sent out a message of warmth and solidarity to the people in our region affected by this tragedy.'

The region of Emilia-Romagna has been rocked by two devastating back to back earthquakes leaving major infrastructure damage and 16 dead.
