An adventurous British biker on a record-breaking ride around the world took a breather from her arduous 56,000-mile journey today to celebrate becoming a grandmother.

Steph Jeavons, 38, is halfway through her record-breaking feat to become the first woman to ride a motorbike across every continent on earth.

She set off from her home in Old Conwy, North Wales, knowing her son Nathan, 20, and his partner were expecting a baby. 

Ms Jeavons was on her motorbike 'Rhonda the Honda' in India when she was told her granddaughter Alexis had arrived. 

She said: 'Jaipur shall always be remembered with fondness as the place I received the news that I had become a grandmother.

'That was pretty emotional I can tell you.

'I would have loved to fly back just for a hug but this was always going to happen and even if my budget allowed, it would probably make it too hard to leave again.

'A Skype call had to suffice. Alexis is beautiful.'

Ms Jeavons also  rode around India and she said she has been welcomed warmly throughout her journey

Ms Jeavons gruelling 56,000-mile journey will take her through 42 countries on a daily food budget of just £5 a day.

She kick-started her attempt to circumnavigate the world on her trusty 250 CRF Honda in March this year - and is traveling with just 35kg of bare essentials.

Ms Jeavons  is relying on people's kindness in each country she rides through to provide an occasional comfy bed and some food when she is not camping in her tiny tent.

She is currently riding through the South East Asian country of Laos after having made it through France, Belgium, Germany, The Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey.

Ms Jeavons then rode through Iran - where women are not allowed to drive - with her head covered by a a Hijab before sailing to Dubai and flying into India.

She has already survived riding through a civil war in East Turkey and deadly stampedes during an Indian pilgrimage.

The lone rider survived driving along the deadly Indian roads where around 650 people died a day in accidents, and rode 18,380 feet up the highest driveable road in the world on the Khardung La in the Himalayas, before entering Nepal and flying into Thailand to continue her motorbike journey overland through South East Asia.

Ms Jeavons' travels will then see her ride through Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and East Timor before sailing to Australia and riding across the southern continent.

Ms Jeavons is hoping to make it to the southern tip of Argentina by the end of January to catch IceBird - the Australian-owned yacht she will sail to Antarctica on with her motorbike lashed to the deck - in her bid to enter the record books.

And after her icy adventure she will leave the tip of Argentina and ride up the backbone of South America and through Central America before entering the USA and Canada on her final stretch before flying home into Britain.

Ms Jeavons said the journey so far had been beyond her wildest dreams and she had seen some unforgettable sights and had been heartened by the kindness of strangers.

She said: 'It has certainly been life changing in many ways. Everyday is a new experience and new people.

'I have now ridden through 17 different countries and covered 15,000 miles in just over 5 months.

The Old Conwy resident has travelled far and wide in her ambitious and far-flung solo adventure

Ms Jeavons said the journey so far had been amazing  and she had seen some unforgettable sights

'I am learning with each new experience about myself, the countries I visit and most importantly that the majority of people are kind and helpful and our biggest fears are generally unfounded.'

The new grandmother said the journey had been a 'roller coaster of emotions' and she was loving the extreme challenges thrown at her.

She said: 'You can't be on a high every day. Some days it can be a lonely experience, particularly when no one around you speaks English.

'But I am loving the challenge. Even the bad times or the scary bits.

'Getting through them is what fuels my motivation and makes me stronger. It has certainly lived up to my expectations and more.'
