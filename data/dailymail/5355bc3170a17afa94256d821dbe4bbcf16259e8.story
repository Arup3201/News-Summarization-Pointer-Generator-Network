A murder investigation has been launched after a 25-year-old man was allegedly stabbed by a love rival at his girlfriend's house.

Adam Wilson was found with a serious stab wound to his leg at a house in the village of Lostock Hall near Preston on Monday night.

It is thought he was visiting his girlfriend when one of her former boyfriend's arrived at the semi-detached house just before 11pm, and an argument broke out.

Detective chief inspector Neil Ashton of Lancashire Police said: 'This is a tragic incident where a young man has lost his life.

'I would appeal for anyone who has any information, however unimportant they think it may be, to come forward and contact us.

'I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw a man described as white male, early twenties, wearing dark coloured tracksuit top and tracksuit bottoms who may have had with him a red mountain bike in the area on Monday.' 

Close friend Shereen Lee, 42, said Mr Wilson, who she described as a ‘cheeky chap’, had only met his girlfriend a few days ago.

'He was best friends with my nephew Lewis and had a heart of gold,' she said.

'He was like a gentle giant and was always respectful.

'He tried to help anyone he could and was always a bit of a cheeky chap - Adam had such a great wit about him.

'He has left me and my sister who knew him so well heartbroken.

'We can’t believe we won’t see him again.

'I know I speak for all of the Clayton Brook community when I say he’s going to be deeply missed.'

Other friends paid tribute to Mr Wilson, known as ‘Adz’, on social media sites.

Shaun Ibbott said: 'Rest in paradise Adam lad, can’t think what your friends and family are going through xxx.'

Jenna Gaskell posted on Facebook: 'R.I.P Adz - can’t actually believe you’ve gone and in such a cruel way.”

Nicola Calvert wrote: 'RIP Adz - taken too soon but never going to be forgotten xxxxxx.'
