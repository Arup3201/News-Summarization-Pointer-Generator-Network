David Beckham's new football club today negotiated a record £110 million shirt sponsorship deal - within two days of him signing.

In what many see as the real reason the 37-year-old arrived at Paris St Germain, executives have jumped on the chance to make as much money from the star's profile as possible.

Replica shirts costing almost £100 with Beckham's name on the back are already flying of the shelves at the club shop on the Champs Elysee.

And according to today's Parisien newspaper: 'After signing David Beckham, there is even more good news for PSG.

'According to our information, the capital's club on Saturday agreed an extension of its shirt sponsoring contract with Emirates, the airline company of the United Arab Emirates.

'The agreement, which focuses on a partnership of five years, from 2014, has risen sharply and reaches a level never recorded in France of 25 million Euros a year, including bonuses.'

This figure amounts to around £110 million and, according to the Parisien, will put the club 'firmly in the category of European heavyweights including Real Madrid, Manchester United, or Barcelona'.

On Friday, within 24 hours of signing for the previously relatively unfashionable PSG, Beckham, was plugging the PSG shirts on his Facebook page, saying he had even bought one for his toddler daughter, Harper, one.

Beckham wrote: 'I've got all the shirts for the kids, you can see little Harper's one here. Blown away by the reception of the people in Paris.'

The player is donating his PSG salary, estimated at around 3 million pounds over a five month contract, to an unspecified children's charity in Paris - a move he has said to have agreed with his wife, Victoria.

Joint decision: Beckham said that he and wife Victoria, pictured with their three sons at the launch of musical Viva Forever, had decided to give his wages to charity

'Glad to get so many positive comments about the donation,' Beckham wrote on the same Facebook page.

'Victoria and I made the decision to give the wages away to a children's charity. We are incredibly fortunate so we are glad we could do this with the club's blessing. Thanks as always for your support, I will always do my best for you.'

But analysts in both France and Britain say that Beckham, who is already worth around 200 million pounds, will still profit from massive image rights payments during his time at PSG.

If Beckham had been paid a straight 
salary, he could have ended up being taxed by as much as 75 per cent by 
France's Socialist government.

As it stands, earnings from marketing are
taxed at just 30 per cent across the Channel.Nasser al-Khelaifi, the club president, has openly described Beckham as an 'asset' who will 'add big value' to PSG.

Football-wise, Beckham was not even 
present for PSG's 4-0 away win at Toulouse on Friday, and is likely to 
figure in less than 15 games before his contract ends in June.

PSG
is ultimately owned by the oil-rich Gulf state of Qatar and the hiring 
of Beckham is all part of giving it a positive image.

The
controversial emirate has been linked with corruption following its 
mysterious capture of the rights to host the World Cup in the summer of 
2022, when temperatures will be 50 degrees centigrade.

FIFA has been presented with new evidence that the vote in 2010 was influenced by cash.

Gilles
Dumas, a French sports marketing expert, said the arrival of Beckham 
was a 'perfect publicity coup' because 'PSG's image suffered from a 
deficiency in soul'.

Despite positive publicity, Beckham's arrival has by no means been entirely welcomed in Paris.

 L'Equipe,
the biggest sports paper in the country, suggested that 'football's 
glamour icon' was little more than a money-spinning fairground 
attraction.

It carried a 
cartoon of the 'S' in PSG turned into a dollar sign, and wrote: 'With 
the signature of the Spice Boy David Beckham yesterday, PSG pulled off a
sensational publicity stunt. The sporting interest of the move is less 
clear.'

Others were even more cruel - with Le Figaro newspaper branding Beckham a 'third-hand Rolls Royce'.
