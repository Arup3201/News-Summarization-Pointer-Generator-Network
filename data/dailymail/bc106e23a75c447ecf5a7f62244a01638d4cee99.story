Mo Farah has been forced to pull out of this weekend’s Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix after suffering abdominal pains, but still hopes to attempt the 5,000m and 10,000m double at the Commonwealth Games in the city later this month.

The double world and Olympic champion was due to run in a special two-mile race at Hampden Park on Saturday night, but is now targeting the London Anniversary Games on Sunday July 20 instead.

Farah, 31, spent ‘a couple of days in hospital’ near his home in Portland, USA, last week after suffering pains in his stomach, but has since flown to the UK for further testing by British Athletics’ medical team.

Farah said: 'Sorry to everyone in Scotland but I won’t be able to make it there this week. I hope to resume training in the next few days and aim to run in the London Anniversary Games on July 20 and then the Commonwealth Games the following week.'

He has run only once on the track, a 5,000m victory in Portland on June 15, since finishing eighth in the London Marathon in April, but is still hopeful of competing at the Commonwealths.

A statement from his management company read: ‘Mo Farah has been forced to cancel his participation in the two miles at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix due to illness.
