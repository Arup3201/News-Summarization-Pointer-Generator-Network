The jury in the high-profile murder trial of Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie has been discharged after new evidence came to light.

Justice Peter Johnson told the Supreme Court jury on Tuesday that they could go home after they spent a month sitting through evidence.

He told them new material given to the crown and then provided to the defence earlier this month meant the only appropriate way to proceed was for the jury to be discharged.
