The former pupils of a school which used a historic stately home as its base during the Second World War have returned after nearly 70 years.

Penrhos College, a girls’ school in Colwyn Bay in Wales, moved to Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, East Midlands, for around seven years during the war while the government used its grounds.

In 1939, staff and students were moved to the Chatsworth Estate – which has been handed down through 16 generations of the Cavendish family.

The pupils of Penrhos College in Colwyn Bay, Wales, were at Chatsworth House between 1939 and 1946, with rooms in the house turned into dormitories. Ex-pupil Nancie Park, pictured, was one of 48 who returned to view the estate as it is now

The stately home is the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, and has been home to his family - the Cavendish family - since Bess of Hardwick settled at Chatsworth in 1549.

During the Second World War, the home housed the girls’ boarding school and saw the State Drawing room turned into a dormitory. The house was reverted to its original appearance when the girls moved out in March 1946.

However now, nearly 70 years later, part of the estate has been transformed back to how it looked when it was used by the school.

Rooms have been reverted back to dormitories, old school uniforms have been hung on mannequins and memorabilia including books from the war and never-before-seen paintings have been put on display.

It is part of an exhibition which has been opened to mark the centenary of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the Second World War.

And 48 former pupils of the girls’ boarding school have returned to the Chatsworth Estate to view the unseen archive collection of objects and photographs from the period.

The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire also attended the reunion and spent time viewing the First World War and Second World War memorabilia displays.

Penrhos College was established in 1880 as a private Methodist school for girls

Penrhos College was founded as a private Methodist school for girls in 
1880 and started with just 12 girls in a couple of three-storied houses 
on Colwyn Bay promenade.

In 1895, the school moved into the premises
 of a former hydropathic spa purchased from the Pwllycrochan Estate. The
 site was a prime location near the beach with good views.

Over the 
following 80 years a number of buildings were built and developed around
 the original hydropathic building and a games field, tennis court and 
garden area were completed. The school expanded greatly during this period.

In 1939, principle Miss Constance Smith 
undertook the considerable task of evacuating the school to Chatsworth 
and then moving back to Colwyn Bay in 1945.

This was due to the government taking over the Penrhos College school grounds and site during the Second World War.

In 1995 the school merged with nearby Rydal School for Boys and the Penrhos College for Girls site was officially closed in 1999.

The former school buildings have since been demolished and the site has since been turned into a substantial housing development.
