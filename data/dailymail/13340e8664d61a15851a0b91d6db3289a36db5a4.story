Gareth Bale has been put through his paces as Chris Coleman’s depleted Wales squad prepare for a crucial home double header in their 2016 European Championship qualifying campaign.

Real Madrid’s forward trained with the Wales team, who have not reached a major tournament since the World Cup finals in 1958, ahead of hosting Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday night and Cyprus on Monday.

The former Spurs forward has said he believes qualifying for Euro 2016 with Wales would rank alongside the achievement of winning the Champions League with Real Madrid last season.

Bale will hope to guide Wales to qualification having been handed a favourable group that includes Bosnia, Belgium, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra, with a top-three finish in Group B giving them a realistic chance of reaching the finals.

The top two in each group qualify automatically along with the best third-place finisher, while the remaining eight third-place teams will head into a playoff. 

Meanwhile Wales boss Chris Coleman is now without 10 senior players for the crucial tie in Cardiff on Friday.

Wigan midfielder Emyr Huws is the latest withdrawal after the 21-year-old picked up an ankle injury in training on Wednesday.

The pressure to perform will certainly be on Bale with the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen remaining on the sidelines.

Wales beat Andorra 2-1 in their opening Group B game, thanks to a late Bale winner, but face a stern test against Bosnia and Cyprus considering their extensive injury list.
