The Coalition turned the screw on Labour over spending last night, releasing the infamous letter admitting there was ‘no money’ left at the 2010 election.

Cabinet Office minister David Laws made public the glib note, left by outgoing Treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne for his successor.

It states: ‘Dear Chief Secretary, I’m afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.’

Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010

The letter has haunted Labour, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation’s  coffers were empty.

On the eve of the latest round of 
spending cuts, the letter from former Treasury minister Liam Byrne has 
been pictured for the first time.

Consisting
of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of
the nation’s finances, only a glib ‘good luck’ to whoever was left to 
clear up the economic mess.

The letter, written in blue ink on government note paper, was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed.

Mr Laws mentioned its existence within days of taking office, claiming he assumed the envelope would offer advice on how to conduct himself in government.

But he refused to bow to calls from former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson to release the actual letter publicly.

As he made the letter public for the 
first time, Mr Laws claimed he had not deliberately intended for it to 
be made public three years ago.

Regret: Labour's Liam Byrne has said he will wish he had never written the not for the rest of his life

Lib Dem Mr Laws said: ‘I didn’t set out to embarrass Liam, but he left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it.

‘I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.’

Labour MPs rounded on Mr Laws, with former minister Tom Harris accusing him of behaving ‘like the class swot’.

Mr Laws told ITV Westcountry about when he opened it:  'I didn’t know who it was from. It looked a bit odd. I really didn’t regard as a big thing'.

'I only mentioned it almost by 
accident at a press conference that we held a few days into the 
government, not expecting – rather naively – the huge reaction that it 
got.

'Within minutes of mentioning it in 
front of a media audience, and without alerting the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer about its existence let alone that I was going to mention it, 
the whole story suddenly went stratospheric.'

Money: Lib Dem David Laws revealed the existence of the note within days of becoming a Treasury minister, working with Tory Chancellor George Osborne

The decision to publish the note ahead of Wednesday’s Spending Review will seriously sour relations with the Labour party.

The Lib Dems have hoped to reposition themselves as more economically competent than Labour, and the note’s release suggests they will use it to hammer home the message in the run up to the 2015 election.

Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said today that the letter was a 'stark reminder that Labour can't be trusted with the economy'.

Earlier this month Mr Byrne, now Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life.

‘It was a very foolish thing to do,’ he told the House magazine.

‘I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private.

‘There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.’

Mr Laws was forced to resign as Chief Secretary to the Treasury - essentially deputy to Chancellor George Osborne - after just 17 days in office after revelations about his expenses.

In September last year he returned to government as Schools Minister, with a roving brief across Whitehall.
