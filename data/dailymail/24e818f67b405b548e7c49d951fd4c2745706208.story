An ecological disaster was narrowly averted today after a British cargo ship was grounded off the coast of Spain.

The eight-hour drama began at 4.15am when coastguards for the northern province of Asturias spotted that the 89metre long Beaumont was too close to rocks.

It sparked fears there could be a major oil spill - such as
the one that blighted a stretch of Galician coast after the Prestige 
oil tanker sank in 2002.

The 2,545ton Beaumont ran on to a bank in the Aviles Estuary as it 
approached the Aviles port on the Bay of Biscay.

Spain's Maritime Rescue Service received a
distress signal at around 4.15am and immediately contacted the vessel.

The British-flagged ship, manned by six crew, soon confirmed to the authorities in a radio call that it was in trouble and had sailed too close to the beach in Xago.

A helicopter, tugboat and speed boat were dispatched to help with the rescue operation and an investigation is now under way into how the collision occurred.

The ship had been transporting wooden pellets from the Galician port of A Coruna for a company called 'Pellets Asturias'.

The tugboat finally managed to dislodge the vessel from the rocks shortly after 1pm.

The crew were reportedly unharmed and did not have to be evacuated during the incident.

The boat carried on its journey, from A Coruña to Avilés, where it was due to pick up a cargo of wooden pellets.

A spokesman for the Coastguard told El Mundo newspaper that damage had been caused to the ballast tank.

But he added that there had not been a fuel leak.

Despite the claim, environmental activists still took to Twitter to question whether this was true.

The newspaper later reported that shipping firm Alvargonzalez told the Ria de Avilés port that the ship may pass through its base for a more thorough investigation.
