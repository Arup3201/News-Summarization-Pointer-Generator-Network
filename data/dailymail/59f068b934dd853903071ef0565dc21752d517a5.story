Firefighters staged a full scale rescue operation when this not so wise tawny owl fell down a chimney.

After three desperate hours they finally managed to recover the sooty and scared animal in Oberneuberg, Austria.

Home owner Bettina Moser dialled emergency services when she could hear the bird's plaintive hoots coming from the stove attached to the kitchen chimney stack.

Action: The firemen climb on top of the roof to gain access to the chimney

Four firefighters turned up at the house and scaled along the roof to the chimney in an attempt to find the bird.

After several fruitless attempts, they decided to drop a soft rubber ball down the chimney on a rope.

'The owl instinctively clung onto the ball and we were able to haul it up to a part of the chimney that was easier to get at,' explained a fire service spokesman.

The team gently retrieved the animal from its awkward hiding place and dusted the soot from its wings.

The owl was checked over by a vet - declared fit to be released - and is now back in the wild.
