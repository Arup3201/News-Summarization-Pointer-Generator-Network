Passengers aboard American Airlines Flight 280 from South Korea to Dallas screamed in terror as their Boeing jet shook violently and dipped after hitting bad turbulence Tuesday.

New video recorded in the first class section of the plane and another shot in coach show the panic and chaos among the passengers, some of whom turned to prayer as their jet jerked from side to side, scattering food and plates everywhere.

Marc Stanley, a prominent Dallas attorney with ties to President Obama, was sitting in the premium part of the plane when it encountered rough conditions.

He turned on his cellphone camera and started taking still photos and recording video showing food and trash scattered in the aisle and splotches of wine on the overhead bins.

One of the images shows a woman wearing what appears to be a neck brace, while in another a man receives medical treatment.

Some passengers could be heard praying or leaving voicemail messages for their loved ones.

Stanley, a fundraiser for Obama and a married father of three, called the experience the worst flight of his life in an interview with CBS DFW.

Flight 280, a Boeing 777-200 heading from Incheon, South Korea, to Dallas/Forth Worth airport, was flying over Japan when the plane dropped suddenly and was rocked intensely for 30 to 40 seconds.

Following the incident, the jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Tokyo. 

The attorney recalled that at one point, it felt as if the jet carrying 240 passengers and 15 crew dropped out of the sky.

A traveler named John Mitchell also made a recording on his phone showing the moment the Boeing took a major dip, sparking panic inside the cabin.

People in coach are heard in the video gasping and screaming in terror as the plane rattles from side to side before taking a sudden dive.

Four passengers and an airline employee were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. 

Stanley, a former Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane was diverted to Narita International Airport in Tokyo 'due to significant passenger and crew injuries and alleged damage to the plane' caused by 'insane turbulence.'

'One flight attendant took out an exit sign. High marks to crew. Low marks to AA weather folks,' Stanley wrote on his page.

Reaching across the aisle: Stanley, a staunch Democrat, raised a few eyebrows among his friends by taking a picture with former Republican House Speaker and presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich 

The status update was accompanied by photos taken by the Obama fundraiser showing splotches of wine on overhead bins, food and soda cans scattered down the aisle and a beverage cart resting on its side.

Stanley, who is married and has three grown children, was appointed by President Obama in 2011 to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Council.

In early July, Stanley threw a late-afternoon, $10,000-a-plate fundraiser dinner at his home, with proceeds going to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Besides the president, the barbecue was also attended by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

On Tuesday, Marc Stanley and his fellow passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the plane hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board.

'We were eating and all the food just flew up in the air and pretty much bounced off and fell. There were carts all over the place,' one passenger told TV Tokyo when the aircraft landed shortly after midnight at Tokyo's Narita airport.

Japanese national broadcaster NHK said one person suffered a broken bone.

The passengers and crew from the flight were given hotel rooms for the night, and the flight will continue to the United States on Wednesday.

Passenger Erin Cherry, 28, who lives in Huntsville, Alabama, told MailOnline Travel: 'There were people injured. The glass plates from business class were broken and being tossed throughout the cabin. 

'There were also some people that were not buckled, and their heads hit the top of the cabin. It all happened when they started serving the in-flight dinner. 

'It was very sudden -- a few bumps, and then trays, plates, silverware, all started flying throughout the cabin.

'When we arrived, there were several ambulances waiting, and the injured people were escorted out first.' 

NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, said at least 14 people were injured.

American Airlines issued a statementsaying: ‘American’s primary concern at this time is for our passengers and crew on board the airplane and our team in Narita is providing assistance.’ 

The Boeing 777 – the world’s largest twin-engine passenger jet – was met by firefighters and paramedics when it touched down in Japan.

It departed Seoul’s Incheon International Airport at 6:16pm local time and landed at the airport east of Tokyo shortly before 1am local time, about four hours after its departure.

The Weather Channel said the plane encountered turbulence while flying through a ‘rapidly intensifying winter storm’ that is expected to become a ‘weather bomb.'

The network said the storm is associated with a powerful ribbon of 150-200mph winds in the jet stream, approximately 38,000ft above sea level.

The storm has prompted blizzard warnings for northern and western Japan, and high wind warnings for coastal areas near Tokyo.

According to flight radar data, the plane was east of Japan when it turned south and then west as it diverted to one of the world’s five busiest airports.

It was scheduled to land at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport at 3pm local time on Wednesday.
