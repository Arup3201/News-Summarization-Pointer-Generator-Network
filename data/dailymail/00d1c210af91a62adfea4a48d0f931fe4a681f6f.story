Tens of thousands of photographs have been used to show the building of the world's largest ship - in just 72 seconds.

The remarkable time-lapse video features 50,000 images taken over three months as the first Maersk Line Triple-E vessel is constructed.

No container ship has ever been built so large.

The completed ship, which is the world's largest, is shown at the end of the remarkable time-lapse video

First steps: The images were taken throughout the building process to illustrate the progress

Building big: The cargo vessel, the largest container ship in the world, was built in Korea

Made in Korea: The team worked day and night to finish building the ship in three months

The giant ship, built in the Daewoo 
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Company shipyard in Okpo, Korea, is 
1,312ft (400m) long and 194ft (59m) wide.

It can hold 18,000 standard shipping containers.

The video shows the huge cranes needed to manoeuvre the ship into the dock piece by piece until the vessel begins to take shape.

The images were taken night and day and show the 24-hour work that went into constructing the vessel.

The brand new ship is then able to sail off on its maiden voyage.

Danish company Maersk and the Discovery Channel collaborated on the project to show every stage of the construction from design to her maiden voyage on the Asia-Europe route.

Morten Engelstoft, chief operating officer of Maersk Line, the world's largest shipping container company, said: 'The Triple-E is an exceptional ship, in 
terms of its size as well as its energy saving technology and design.

Project: The Danish company created the video with the help of the Discovery channel

'We're excited about these vessels and proud to have Discovery Channel as
a partner for showing how it is built and the people and passion behind
it.'

The 20 Triple-E class ships can told 111million pairs of trainers each and are 239ft (72m) high.

Maersk Line announced in 2011 that it had signed the contract to build the ships, which it said are the most efficient in the world.

The company said its size means it can move the greatest number of containers possible with a smaller CO2 footprint.

The story of the ships' construction is being told in a six-episode TV series on Discovery Channel in November, after the was given access to the build.
