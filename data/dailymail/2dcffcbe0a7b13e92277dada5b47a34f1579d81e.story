Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline has sold popular soft drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena to Orangina and Schweppes owner Suntory Beverage & Food for £1.35billion, it was announced today.

Glaxo is selling the historic brands to Japanese drinks group Suntory after putting them up for sale earlier this year.

Lucozade and Ribena, which date back to 1927 and the 1930s respectively, are made in the UK at a factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, which employs around 500 staff.

The drugs company kicked off their sale in April after concluding they would grow better under a different owner. 

Investors, however, reacted badly to the news with Glaxo shares lower by 2.5p to 1,648.5p.Glaxo
plans to focus on its consumer healthcare business, which includes 
brands such as Sensodyne, Panadol, Aquafresh and Niquitin.

Lucozade is the UK's top-selling energy and sports drink, while blackcurrant drink Ribena is the fourth-best selling fruit juice and concentrate.

The two drinks brands achieved combined sales of £600million last year but three quarters of sales were in the UK, while they have virtually no presence in emerging markets where Glaxo sees its future growth potential.

Glaxo chief strategy officer David Redfern said Lucozade and Ribena have made a huge contribution over the years, and their future is in ‘good hands’.

He said: ‘Now is the right time to sell them as we increase the focus of our consumer healthcare business and execute the delivery of our late stage pipeline of pharmaceuticals and vaccines.’

Glaxo said the ‘vast majority’ of staff at Coleford and working in commercial, research and development will transfer to Suntory. Glaxo will continue to make and distribute the drinks in Nigeria under licence from Suntory.

The drinks were owned by Beecham prior to its merger with Glaxo 13 years ago, and more than three-quarters of their sales are in the UK.

Suntory, which bought Orangina in 2009 for £2.2billion, said the brands will help it grow faster in the UK and expand to become the leading global soft drink company by 2020. It debuted on the stock market earlier this year with a float that raised £2.6billion. 

The cash deal is expected to complete by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.Suntory Beverage & Food, which is part of the £12billion turnover Suntory Group, said the drinks' sales networks will help it grow its other brands in countries such as Nigerian and Malaysia.

The sale also prevents what could have turned into an auction for the brands which are said to have attracted considerable interest from private equity groups including CVC Capital Partners and KKR, and were also reportedly in the sights of Irn-Bru owner AG Barr.

In the three months to the end of June, Lucozade sales grew 4 per cent but Ribena was down 2 per cent.

'Glucozade' was first brewed in 1927 by William Owen, a chemist in Newcastle.

It was Mr Owen's answer to tiredness for people suffering from the flu or a common cold.

By 1929, then renamed Lucozade, it was stocked in most British hospitals.

A great success, the fizzy orange drink caught the eye of soft drink magnate Beechams - which would become GlaxoSmithKline - in 1938.

By the early 1950s, they would rely on Lucozade to bring in half their profits.

Until 1982, it was sold in a glass bottle with yellow cellophane wrapping.

But in 1983, renamed and reformed management GlaxoSmithKline gave the beverage a makeover.

The slogan changed from 'Lucozade aids recovery' to 'Lucozade replaces lost energy' - with a plastic bottle brought in instead.

With Olympic decathlete Daley Thompson as the face and a range of new flavours, it became the brand success story of the 1980s.

In 1990, Lucozade Sport was launched, with stars such as Liverpool's John Barnes, Alan Shearer and rugby national Jonny Wilkinson heading up their various advertising campaigns.

Their novelty editions include 'Larazade' in 2001, fashioned to coincide with the film Tomb Raider - taking its name from Angelina Jolie's character Lara Croft.

Since its launch, Lucozade remains the leading brand in the energy drinks category.

Invented in 1938 as a pure fruit syrup, Dr Vernon Charley was trying to find something to add to his milkshake.

The name 'Ribena' comes from 'Ribes nigrum' - the botanical name for blackcurrant - meant to reflect the natural content, rich in Vitamin C.

During World War Two, other Vitamin C sources like oranges, made in America, were difficult to get hold of.

The government encouraged growth of blackcurrants and the manufacture of this new sweet cordial, delivered to children's homes for free - at first without the brand name.

After a steady rise in popularity, then-owners Carters were bought out by GlaxoSmithKline in 1955.

The first television advert sent sales soaring.

Like Lucozade, the soft drinks organisation diversified the range and pumped advertising.

In the 1980s, the 'Ribena Berries' - friendly blackcurrant-shaped characters - were created.

Canned 'Sparkling Ribena' hit shelves in the 1980s, replaced by 'Ribena Spring' in 1993, which was changed to 'Ribena Spark' a few years later.

Other versions have included raspberry, strawberry and peach flavours.

Issues have arisen over the stated level of Vitamin C content and number of berries used.

The suggestion that '95 per cent of British berries' are used to produce the drink came under fire in the 1990s. Their branding now states that 'most' berries are used.
