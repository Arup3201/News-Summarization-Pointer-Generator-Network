With divorce fast becoming the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days.

But as these letters reveal, one smitten couple found a love so strong it was able to endure even while they were separated during World War II.

Not only that, it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until they both died in 2011, he aged 96 and she aged 92, within just three days of one another.

How time passes: Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day 1941 while Frederick 
was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps and stayed married for 
the next 70 years

But, as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life, in death it was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise.

After Frederick and Elizabeth Noble had passed relatives discovered they had kept 250 love letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards from each other.

Their grandson, Dr Andrew Rowland, has taken them along to the Antique Roadshow TV program.

In one extract read on tonight's show, Frederick writes: 'You are the most wonderful, marvellous, precious, beloved, lovable, 
adoring, adorable, charming, divine and loving sweetheart wife that has 
ever lived.

'Darling, come a little closer and let me whisper in 
your darling ears, all these loving words, because they are meant for 
you, my sweetheart.'

The pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout World War II

The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea chest

The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Wingate, County Durham.

Speaking about the letters, Fiona Bruce, the show's host, said: 'Theirs was a real love story. What struck me about the 
letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages.

'They 
reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love burned
even more brightly while they were forced apart by war.'

Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day in 1941 while he was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps.

He had volunteered for the Army in 1936 despite having been selected 
as a professional footballer by Aston Villa and served in Afghanistan,
India, Burma, Ceylon and France.

From these war-torn 
countries he wrote the tear-jerking telegrams to his wife who was 
nursing injured servicemen back home.

After the war,
Elizabeth carried on her work as a nurse while Frederick became a miner 
in the East Durham coalfield, before rising to the position of colliery overseer.

During their long lives the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren and it was grandson who discovered the letters

Perhaps the most heart-wrenching messages were written when Frederick's leave was cancelled. He says: 'I'm very sorry my beloved, I can't get home. That's all I live for, 
home and you.

In another passage he adds: 'We both feel the same when I have to return from leave. I have to take a
firm hold of myself or I would never come back.

'I hate to see the back 
of you as my bus or train pulls out because I know it will be weeks 
before I set eyes on you again. It's terrible when we have to part - too
awful for words.'

Showing a touch of humour, Frederick writes again to compliment his wife's skill in the kitchen: 'Darling, no matter what you think, I still say that you are a good cook
- so let's not have a small row. You know I wish that today I could 
have sat down to one of your dinners.'

Elizabeth's communication is more limited, as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret.

In the letters she did write she talks about the home front, rationing, and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the main road near their house.

Only a small selection of letter were taken to Antiques Roadshow for filming and the family are keeping the rest secret while they decide what to do with them

While the letters reveal a lot about the couple's marriage, the war and their incredible devotion to one another, only a small selection were taken along to the show's filming in North Yorkshire.

The rest are being kept a secret while the family, made up of the couple's two daughters, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, decide what to do with them.

In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Dr Rowland revealed that towards the end of their lives the pair talked about not wanting to go on without each other.

He said that the family were comforted in their sadness by the thought that, in the end, Elizabeth had only had to endure three days without her beloved other half.

Frederick died peacefully on December 4th, 2011, and Elizabeth on December 7th.
