A House of Lords peer has been convicted today of assaulting a motorist in a road rage incident in Northern Ireland.

Lord Ken Maginnis, 75, a former Ulster Unionist Party MP, was found guilty at Dungannon Magistrates’ Court of grabbing Keith Kirk by the arm and threatening to punch him.

The court heard the peer became enraged after Mr Kirk honked his car horn at him during the incident in Dungannon last summer.

The peer admitted calling Mr Kirk a 'yellow bellied b******' but had denied the charge of common assault.

District Judge John Meehan said he was satisfied the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

He fined Lord Maginnis £200 and ordered him to pay a further £200 in compensation to Mr Kirk.

Following the hearing, the peer said he had already lodged an appeal.

He said: 'I am obviously not letting it rest here.

'One
might say what’s a couple of hundred pounds but this is my reputation. 
And I am appealing it, I can assure you I am appealing it.'

He had previously suggested to the court that political factors were behind his prosecution.

He told the court from the witness box that a speech he had delivered in the House of Lords earlier this year, in which he referred to the incident as a non-offence, had influenced the move to prosecute him.

Lord Maginnis also claimed his threat to take court proceedings against Stephen Farry, Stormont's Employment and Learning Minister, was also a factor.

Mr Kirk told the court that he was taking his younger sister to the bank when a red Honda CRV pulled out of a junction in front of him without looking, causing him to break suddenly.

He said he honked his horn - an act he alleged prompted Lord Maginnis to get out of his vehicle and march back to confront him through the wound down window.

Mr Kirk claimed the peer, a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, grabbed his arm and held the other fist in the air threatening a punch.

'He grabbed my right arm with his left hand and he had his right hand in a fist, he was trying to hit me with it,' he claimed.

The prosecution conceded it was a non injury assault and that the politician had not struck Mr Kirk.

Judge Meehan said he had taken account of Lord Maginnis’s years of public service in determining the punishment.
