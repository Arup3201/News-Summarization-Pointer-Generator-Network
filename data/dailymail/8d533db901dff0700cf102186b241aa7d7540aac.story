Facebook has started charging users up to £10 to message celebrities and others outside their circle of friends.

Under the trial scheme, it costs 71p to send a standard message on the social networking site.

But the fees vary depending on the popularity of the recipient, with a current maximum charge of £10.68 to contact celebrities such as Olympic diver Tom Daley.

Top dollar: Facebook users will pay £10.69 to contact celebrities including diver Tom Daley, seen using his mobile phone during practice at the Aquatics Centre before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games

Popular: It will cost users more to send a message to the young Olympic diver via Facebook than to less popular, or non-celebrity users

It puts him a tier above U.S. gangster rapper Snoop Dogg and Booker prize-winning author Salman Rushdie, both of whom cost £10.08 to message.

And in what may cause some embarrassment, many well-known figures such as broadcaster Louis Theroux and comedian Miranda Hart can currently be contacted for the standard charge of 71p.

The fee structure is decided by a mathematical formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the number of followers a user has on Facebook and how many messages they receive.

Charges to contact somebody using the 
system can rise and fall under the system.

The fees were introduced for 
10 per cent of British users as a trial at the end of last month with 
the plan to introduce it to all members of Facebook in the country.

Sliding scale: The new charges depend on the popularity of the recipient so it will cost £10.08p to send Snoop Dogg a message, while fans of Miranda Hart will pay just 71p to contact her via Facebook

The company said that the paid for 
‘priority messages’ were intended to stop users from being bombarded 
with unwanted contact from strangers

But Facebook faced criticism yesterday after details of the costs became known, especially because it has boasted that ‘the site is ‘free and always will be’.

Peter Wood, social media director at digital marketing agency Steak, tweeted: ‘Facebook charging users in the UK to contact celebs online. 1-0 Twitter. Seems a bit mean to charge someone to send fan mail.’

Users who are Facebook friends or who share mutual friends are still able to keep in contact with no charge.

There is also a cap on the number of paid messages any user can receive.

Messages are sent directly to a recipient’s inbox on their profile page.

Those who don’t want to pay are still
 able to send a message, but these are not put into the recipients inbox
 but another box called in the “other folder” that most people rarely 
check and many don’t even know about.

The charge can be paid online instantly with a credit or debit.

Under-18s are barred from making such payments and are also blocked from receiving unsolicited messages.

Users in the US are charged $1, $5 or $15 to send a priority message.

Facebook scrapped a $100 fee to 
contact the most prominent celebrities after it was mocked for applying 
the charge to contact the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

In Britain questions were also raised
 over the charging formulae after it emerged that one of those who it is
 most expensive to contact is Michael Rosen, the former children’s 
laureate.

Users are also being charged the maximum £10.68 to contact a 
fake Facebook account set up in the name of singer Ed Sheeran.

Facebook said: ‘The system of paying 
to message non-friends in their Facebook inbox is designed to prevent 
spam, while acknowledging that sometimes you might want to hear from 
people outside your immediate social circle.

‘We are testing a number of price 
points in the UK and other countries to establish the optimal fee that 
signals importance. Part of that test involves charging higher amounts 
for public figures, based on the number of followers they have.

‘This is still a test and these prices are not set in stone.’
