Lying on the ground in agony after a motorbike accident, former RAF corporal Craig Stevens was understandably relieved when a Good Samaritan stopped by his side.

But to his horror, instead of attending to the blood pouring from his leg, the man began to search through his pockets.

Vulnerable, terrified and in excruciating pain, Mr Stevens pleaded with the stranger to stop – but to no avail.

‘I cannot believe that someone could do that to me, when I was so helpless and in need,’ the 51-year-old said from his hospital bed.

‘I could feel his hands going through all of my pockets, I couldn’t move. I was trapped, in pain and heavily bleeding. I was pleading with him to stop, to help me instead of stealing from me but he carried on. I feel angry. I feel violated.’

Mr Stevens, who served in the Gulf War, was injured as he went to fill his motorbike with petrol ready for a charity ride with the Royal British Legion.

Mr Steven's partner, Nita Maisuria, says she is appalled that when her partner needed help, someone acted in such a 'disgusting' way

His arm was broken and his leg cut down to the bone – a critical injury due to the blood-thinning medication he takes for leukaemia, which he was diagnosed with three years ago.

Following the accident in Hayes, West London, last week, the former RAF corporal has undergone two major operations and a skin graft on his leg, and remains in St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.

However Mr Stevens, from Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, said he also feels betrayed by the police, who he says told him they would not investigate the theft.

‘The man who did this is still out there,’ he said. ‘The police said they would only investigate the accident and not the robbery – that is not their choice to make. I am a victim of crime, he might have only taken the £40 I had in cash, but that is not the point. I want the police to do something.’

After his ordeal, an off-duty nurse came to his aid and dialled 999.

His girlfriend Nita Maisuria, 35, has stayed by his side in hospital. She said: ‘This is the last thing you expect to happen in England.

‘I am appalled that people like this exist and that when Craig needed help, someone acted in such a disgusting way.’

Mr Stevens – who has a 17-year-old daughter from a previous marriage – served with the RAF for nine years before joining Air Canada as an engineer.

Since his cancer diagnosis he has become an active member of the Royal British Legion and now helps to organise fundraising motorcycle rides, which he joins on his beloved Triumph Bonneville.

The accident happened on Uxbridge Road in Hayes at 2:30pm on Saturday, June 7. Mr Stevens describes his attacker as black, around 5ft 6in tall, in his 40s and wearing a trilby hat.

After being contacted by the Daily Mail, police officers visited Mr Stevens in hospital to take a statement regarding the robbery.
