On first glance they appear just like normal pictures.

But these stunning images - featuring the late Apple founder Steve Jobs and American Democrat Stephanie Tubbs Jones - are extraordinary 3D sculptures.

The clever creations are made of several layers of recycled materials - including bullet-proof glass.

Clever: The creations - including this one of Steve Jobs - are made of several layers of recycled materials including bullet-proof glass. Each are then hung up, or placed on platforms, to build a portrait in stunning detail

Each are then hung up to build a portrait in amazing detail.

Artist Michael Murphy can take up to one year working on the pieces, which measure between three feet and a staggering 22 feet in size.

Mr Murphy, who teaches Art and Technology at Georgia College, America, said his inspiration came from video projection.

The 36-year-old said: 'In 2000 I was projecting images on to sculpted surfaces.

'Through that work I was able to combine two-dimensional images with three-dimensional forms.

'My inspiration for this work came from there.'

Mr Murphy, from Milledgeville, Georgia, uses photographs as a base.

The initial layout and design is completed on computer software Adobe Design and then each of the shapes are hand cut.

He said: 'Most of the hanging pieces 
are made from recycled materials, for outdoor projects I use more 
permanent materials such as stainless steel.

'I have been using a large supply of acrylic that I found in a bin at a plastic company.'

He added: 'The time it takes to put the pieces together varies depending on the materials and scale of the project.

'Size ranges anywhere from three feet tall to 22 feet and I can spend anywhere between a week to a year putting them together.'

Mr Murphy's pieces are currently on display at gallery nine5 in New York.

Five of his larger, permanent creations can also be seen in Cleveland, Ohio.

Mr Murphy added: 'I like to get positive reactions from a wide range of people - regardless of their age or education in art.'
