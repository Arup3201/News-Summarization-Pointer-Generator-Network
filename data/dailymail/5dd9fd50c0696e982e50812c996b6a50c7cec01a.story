Live Aid founder Sir Bob Geldof is caught up in a row with his neighbour over plans for a garden gate linked to his 900-year-old country estate.

Deborah Reynolds wants to reinstate an old opening in the wall of the former rockstar's mansion in Kent, but Sir Bob says it is a security risk.

Ms Reynolds, 43, says the gate will give her better access to the garden of her Grade II-listed, end-terrace house which stands right next to Sir Bob's land.

But the ex-pop star is opposing her planning application and says putting a gate in his wall would allow people easy access to his home.

Row: Sir Bob Geldof wants to stop his neighbour opening up an old gate (circled) linked to his property's wall so she can get better access to her garden

In his letter of objection, Sir Bob, 61, wrote: ''I oppose this application because permission will not be given to the applicant to undertake these changes to my property.

'In addition, I will not allow any right of way over my land between the gateway and the rear garden.

'I further object on grounds of loss of amenity. To open a 'gate' at this point in the boundary wall of my property will be a tangible security risk to it.

'During the three decades I have occupied the house it was only by reluctantly creating a fenced boundary onto Dark Hill and by growing hedges [...] that I have been able to finally stop repeated encroachments onto my grounds.'

Argument: Sir Bob says he would not allow any right of way over his land at Davington priory in Kent,  and argues that it will be unsecured if allowed

Ms Reynolds, 43, wants to put the opening in an area where a gate previously existed before it was bricked over in the 1930s.

She said: 'The land is not shared - it is my land.

'I am proposing to re-instate a side access gate adjacent to my property to enable myself to have side access.'

Ms Reynolds' cottage was once part of the Davington Priory estate where Sir Bob has lived for 30 years.

Villagers said they supported their famous neighbour's opposition to the gate.

Jaqueline Hitchcock, 86, said: 'In the past people have jumped over the wall into Bob's grounds.

'If there is a gate directly into his land then there certainly would be a security risk for him.

'There is no need to put the gate in. I cannot understand why there is a problem with access to the cottage.'

Retired publican Terence Boulton, 66, said 'Bob isn't usually up himself or anything like that.

'He's very approachable and doesn't act like a superstar. He talks to people and is often seen walking around the town.'

A decision on Ms Reynolds' application is due to be announced on August 22.
