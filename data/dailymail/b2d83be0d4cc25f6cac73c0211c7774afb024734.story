Heptathlete Louise Hazel took a break from her hectic training schedule to strip off for this week's Sport magazine.

The 2010 Commonwealth gold medallist offers personal training sessions on her website, and these impressive shots of the 29-year-old give her a glowing endorsement.

Hazel looks in top shape as she bares all for Sport Uncovered, a new photography series revealing sportsmen and women as they’ve never been seen before.

And the Birchfield Harriers athlete insists she's proud of her athletic physique.

She said: 'What the Olympics showed us in 2012 is that there are a wealth of inspirational women out there who are dedicated to their sport.

'As female athletes we often get tarred with the brush of being too athletic. It shocks me. We’re sportswomen – that’s what we do. our life is about health, it's our lifestyle.'

Hazel's personal best of 6,166 points set in Germany in 2011 ranked her as the seventh best British heptathlete of all time, but she called time on her career in September 2013.

She was forced to abort a comeback at last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow due to a flare-up of the ulcerative colitis condition she suffers from.

Sport Uncovered begins on Friday January 16  and will be followed by a number of others including footballer Marvin Sordell, Paralympian Beth Woodward and swimmer Mark Foster.
