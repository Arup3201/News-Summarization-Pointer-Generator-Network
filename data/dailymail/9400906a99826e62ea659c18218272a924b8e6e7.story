As the anchor of a major American news program, he needs to be ready when big stories break.

So, in order to be able to 'think straight' at short notice, Brian Williams no longer drinks alcohol.

The NBC 'Nightly News' journalist revealed that he avoids alcoholic beverages during a question and answer session with viewers and fans on Facebook.

He also admitted that he never really 'loved' drinking anyway and some relatives 'have had a rough time' with it in the past, so it was 'easy' to give up.

News anchor: Brian Williams, 55, revealed that he avoids alcoholic beverages during a question and answer session with viewers and fans on Facebook. He also admitted that he never really 'loved' drinking anyway

Viewer Jack Boler asked him: 'Why don't you drink Brian?'

Williams, 55, from New Canaan, Connecticut, responded: 'Used to/never really loved it/some family members have had a rough time with it...so I figure since I never know when news is gonna break out...and I so often need to drive and/or think straight...its an easy thing to do without!'

During the Facebook chat on Wednesday evening, the father of two, whose daughter Allison stars as Marnie Michaels on the U.S. comedy-drama series Girls, answered questions on both his personal and professional life.

One of the questions he was asked was: 'What do you think of volunteer fire departments?'

In response, Williams, who worked as a volunteer firefighter for three years at Middletown Township Fire Department during high school, admitted that he 'misses doing it every day'.

He replied: ''They are the backbone of our country. No matter how big or fancy we get, the truth is in most American communities -- outside of our big cities: when you have a fire in your home, it's your neighbors who drop what they are doing, get out of bed and risk their lives to put the fire out.

'It's a pure public service. I miss doing it every day. Thank you for the question.' 

Another query: One of the questions he was asked was: 'What do you think of volunteer fire departments?'

During the online session, the journalist, who has worked as the anchor and managing editor of Nightly News since 2004, also revealed that he is not a natural golfer.

Alfonso Colon asked: 'Do you play golf?', to which Williams replied: 'No. Too frustrating and with a club in my hand I'm probably a danger to others.'

He continued: 'One of the few times I tried on an actual golf course, I somehow managed to hit a drive backwards into the windshield of the cart and I almost killed two friends of mine.

Disaster Williams's other confessions included that his reporting on Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has 'stuck with' him the most. Above, water floods the Industrial Canal in New Orleans, Louisiana, in September 2005

'I play baseball and throw a football on the beach with my son. No one gets hurt - at least not yet.'

Williams's other confessions included that his reporting on Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has 'stuck with' him the most, that he feels his nose 'heads off on a weird angle' and that he has always wanted to buy a home at the Jersey Shore. 

1. Brittain Jones: 'What story have you covered in your career has stuck with you the most?'

Williams: 'I think.. and its close...it will always be Katrina...just because it bonded me with that fantastic place and we saw such profound suffering...our own people were failed by their own Government in such a profound way. It was hard to watch -- but an honor to tell their stories.'

2. Kate Silveira: 'Last year my son (at 2 years old) wanted to be Lestor Holt for Halloween. This year at 3 years old, he is requesting to be you Brian Williams! Any words of advice on how to pull the best B. Williams for Halloween?'

Williams: 'Best advice: have someone break his nose, so it heads off on a weird angle (KIDDING...DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. ATTEMPT AT SELF-EFFACING HUMOR DUE TO BROKEN NOSE IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL) but seriously...if I'd known I was gonna work in television I wouldn't have settled for having my nose put back into place...after being broken by the bridge of my helmet...with two popsickle sticks on the sidelines. Other than that: tell him to rock a good tie and walk around saying we'll look for you right back here tomorrow night.'

3. Dynasty Wright: 'What is your favorite place to travel to?'

Williams: 'This is not pandering. I swear. But I've been all over the country and the world...and I always wanted a place at the Jersey Shore, where I grew up. Now that we have one...and it's so easy to get to...there is no destination that brings down my pulse and blood pressure quite as quickly as the Jersey Shore. We can't change where we're from or where we feel the most at home. I know the roads, the customs, the language, the food and I'd like to think I know the people there best.'  

4. Marvin Dowdy Jr: 'What do you think of volunteer fire departments?'

Williams: 'They are the backbone of our country. No matter how big or fancy we get, the truth is in most American communities -- outside of our big cities: when you have a fire in your home, it's your neighbors who drop what they are doing, get out of bed and risk their lives to put the fire out. It's a pure public service. I miss doing it every day. Thank you for the question.'

5. James Ewing: 'Does the orchestral intro music get you as pumped up for the news as it does for me?' 

Williams: 'Yes -- and in the studio, we play the dance mix.

6. Tabitha Pereira: 'What's your dream car?' 

Williams: 'I love this question. The problem is the answer. The hardest show for me to watch is Barrett-Jackson auto auctions...I can never go NEAR one of those in real life -- I'd spend all our money -- I love American muscle cars from the 60's.. all of them.. Chargers, Chevelles, Mustangs, Vettes, Camaros, GTO's... of the new stuff, there's some greats out there from all the American manufacturers. And while I woudn't kick an Aston Martin Vanquish out of the garage...its like an addiction I have to avoid!'

7. Jack Boler: 'Why don't you drink Brian?'

Williams: 'Used to/never really loved it/some family members have had a rough time with it...so I figure since I never know when news is gonna break out...and I so often need to drive and/or think straight...its an easy thing to do without!'

8. Leslie Riley: 'What do you watch at home?' 

Williams: 'A ton. Too much. Boardwalk is great again. Homeland is about to hit. News and lots of it. Roosevelts up to my neck right now. Thanks, Ken.'

9. Fran Samaras Hyde: 'What is the favorite thing about your job?'

Williams: 'Taking questions on Facebook. Seriously: with all the tough news we must cover day in and day out - we have elective stories we can choose to do on nice people, brave people -- the good that goes on every minute of every day...the stuff that keeps us going.'

10. Jimmie Vestal: 'Will you be making another appearance on Saturday Night Live?'

Williams: 'hmmm appreciate the question but that was SO outside my area of expertise and it was SO nerve-wracking...I don't know if I could ever survive it. Hey anybody heard from Feist??'
