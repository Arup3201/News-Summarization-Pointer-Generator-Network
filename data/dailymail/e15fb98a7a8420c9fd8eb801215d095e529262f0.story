Hacked: The family of murdered Milly Dowler, 13, will receive £2m compensation from News International to settle their claim over the interception of her voicemails

Milly Dowler's family will receive £2million in compensation over revelations the murdered youngster's phone was hacked by the News Of The World.

Milly's family and News International confirmed the settlement and a further £1million donation to charity in a joint statement today.

Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, NI's parent company, said he made the donation to underscore his regret for the 'abhorrent' hacking of the schoolgirl's phone.

Mr Murdoch shut the 168-year-old News Of The World in July after evidence emerged that its reporters listened into voice mail messages left for Milly, 13, who disappeared in 2002 and was later found murdered.

NI confirmed it was paying the family £2million to settle their civil claim over the interception of Milly's voice mail messages by a private investigator working for the paper.

Mr Murdoch's personal donation will be divided between six charitable causes chosen by the Dowler family, the statement said.

'Nothing that has been agreed will ever bring back Milly or undo the traumas of her disappearance and the horrendous murder trial earlier this year,' the Dowlers said in the statement.

'The only way that a fitting tribute could be agreed was to ensure that a very substantial donation to charity was made in Milly's memory.

'We hope that projects will be undertaken so that some good can come from this.'

The revelation that reporters eavesdropped on Milly Dowler's voice mail messages while police were searching for her - and mounting evidence that phone hacking was routine at the newspaper - shook the Murdoch media empire, and sent tremors through Britain's political, police and media establishments.

The scandal has forced the resignation of two of London's top police officers, ousted executives at News Corp and claimed the job of Prime Minister David Cameron's former spin doctor, Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor.

Mr Murdoch's media conglomerate News Corp has expressed contrition, launched an internal inquiry and set aside £20million to compensate victims, who could number in their hundreds.

Detectives have informed more than 450 people that they might have been spied on by the newspaper.
