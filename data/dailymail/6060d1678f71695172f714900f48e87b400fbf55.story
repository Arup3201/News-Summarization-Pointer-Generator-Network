Traditionally, women sought cosmetic surgery to emulate the lithe limbed models that adorn their favourite glossy magazines. But times are changing. 

Cosmetic salons have seen a huge increase in enquiries for fat transfer over the last 12 months, suggesting a rise in popularity for softer, more natural-looking cosmetic procedures.

The treatment, for which enquiries have soared by 324 per cent, is a simple procedure that works by transferring unwanted fat from other areas of the body to the breast and buttocks.

Women seeking the treatment aim to emulate the softer, more seductive silhouettes of movie stars from the Golden Era such as the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren, who were all renowned for their natural breasts, slim waists and curvaceous bottoms and thighs.

This minimally invasive procedure works by using Vaser Liposuction - a technique that uses ultrasound technology to breakdown fat cells, which are then removed from your body through a suction process - to remove the unwanted fat.

This fat (perhaps from the thighs or stomach) is then injected into the area of your choice, usually the breast and buttocks.

This rise in fat transfer enquiries is a departure from the nineties and naughties trend of high fashion slim frames, say cosmetic surgeons.

A spokesperson for EF Medispa, who offer the £1,500 treatment and noticed the spike in enquiries, said: 'Fat transfer, as well as being minimally invasive, is renowned for achieving a far more natural look than implants, which can often look obvious and harsh. 

'It is the perfect combination, eradicating unwanted fat from one area and transferring it to your area of choice. 

'With minimal risks, fat transfer is fast becoming a favoured alternative to cosmetic surgery for those looking to achieve the soft, curvy looks of celebrities such as those from the past and also modern muses such as Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Kate Upton, Sofia Vergara and Kim Kardashian, who are regularly named as the body inspirations by our customers.' 

Is the skinny look out of fashion? Cara Delevingne, left, and Jourdan Dunn, right, are known for their trim physiques but women are seeking fuller figures with the help of fat transfer, say surgeons
