A shipwreck discovered off the Isles of Scilly is thought to be a legendary vessel belonging to Sir Walter Raleigh - which sank as he searched for the 'Lost City Of Gold'.

The stricken 50ft boat called Flying Joan set sail in 1617 from Plymouth in Devon towards the West Indies.

It was part of a fleet led by Raleigh looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado - but was scuttled by a huge storm and sank without a trace.

The 120 tonne ship has languished on the ocean floor for nearly 400 years. But divers now say they have found it off the coast of the Scilly Isles.

Egypt's antiquities minister, Mohamed Ibrahim, said they were are the oldest papyri ever found in Egypt.

He said one ancient papyrus tells of the activities of an official named Merrer, who was involved in building the Great Pyramid of Giza, the tomb of Khufu.

'He mainly reported about his many trips to the Turah limestone quarry to fetch block for the building of the pyramid.

'Although we will not learn anything new about the construction of the Cheops monument, this diary provides for the first time an insight on this matter.'
