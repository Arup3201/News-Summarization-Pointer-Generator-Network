The 54-year-old grandfather who was severely beaten by a Detroit mob when he stopped to help a young boy has finally left hospital six weeks after the attack.

A simple message simply stating 'Steve Utash is home' was posted online on Saturday, as his family announced that he had left a rehabilitation center.

The 54-year-old had been left with serious head injuries after a gang of men attacked him after he stopped to help a 10-year-old he had accidentally hit with his pick up truck.

Road to recovery: Steve Utash is back with his family after suffering severe head injuries in an April 2 attack

The tree trimmer had been in hospital 
since April 2, and more recently was moved to the DMC Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan. 

'He is home and doing very well. It is wonderful to have him back,' Mr Utash’s family told the Detroit Free Press.

Mr Utash was punched and kicked by a group of men, and his injuries were so serious that at first doctors had put him in a medically induced coma and told his family he could suffer lasting brain damage.

But he is starting to regain his memory and has been making good progress, At the end of last month he had been well enough to be moved to a rehabilitation center.

Earlier this week, Mandi Emerick had posted on Facebook that her father was doing much better.

'He doesn’t need a sitter in his room anymore either and he is almost back to his old self. We are overjoyed that he’s OK,' she wrote.

Fears: Doctors had to put the 54-year-old in a medically induced coma after he was kicked and punched

Support: Steve Utash's family, including wife, Starr,  have been touched by the generous donations to help pay for his medical bills

Mr Utash was saved from his attackers by Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the neighborhood and who had also rushed out to help the boy who had been knocked down.

Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident when Mr Utash hit the young boy, who had run into the road and was later treated for leg injuries.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online.

Four men have been charged with attempted murder; and a 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, was charged with assault and ethnic intimidation. Mr Utash is white and his attackers are African-American.

Mr Utash's son, Joe, has said that his father has been touched by the public's support.

Nearly $200,000 in donations have been made to a Go Fund Me page, set up to help pay for his medical bills when it was revealed that Mr Utash had no medical insurance.
