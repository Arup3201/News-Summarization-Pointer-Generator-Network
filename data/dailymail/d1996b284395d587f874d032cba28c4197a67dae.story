He's the walking talking encyclopaedia of chocolate, well REAL chocolate that is, dubbed the real life 'Willy Wonka' who has claimed to revoluntionise the way we think about, experience and indulge in chocolate.

Quirky UK artisan chocolatier, Willie Harcourt Cooze has devoted much of his life, to crafting the world's most perfect blend and says what we now know as the delicious treat is in fact, not real chocolate.

'What's happened at the turn of the century, big companies have gobbled up producing chocolate and adding cheap ingredients like processed sugar, which is highly addictive, to put in the flavour what we think chocolate is about,' he said.

Quirky UK artisan chocolatier, Willie Harcourt Cooze, started his chocolate journey after buying a cacao farm in Venezuela 

Willie, dubbed UK's 'Willy Wonka' and a cross between Bear Grylls and chef Heston Bumenthal, still uses antique machines in making his chocolate because they capture subtle notes and unique flavours

'A good cacao with properly fermented beans will open people's eyes when they eat it.'

'People are surprised (at the difference) you see the awakening in their face, like it was for me.'

Willie, who has been dubbed a mix between adventurer Bear Grylls and famous chef Heston Blumenthal, started his chocolate quest nearly two decades.

He bought a 1,000 acre cacao farm in the rainforests of Venezuela, then created a custom-built factory to make chocolate in his own way with antique machines which are smaller and slower than their modern counterparts, but capture subtle notes and unique flavours.

'Chocolate was a fruit of the gods, it was used and drunk in many ceremonial occasions in South America, it was special back then.'

'Forgotten is the goodness of chocolate.'

To bring that back, the chocolate enthusiast says he goes to extreme lengths to get his beans which are the most important in making the best quality.

'I've just recently been to Columbia and Peru to extend my search for new people,' he said excitedly.

'In eight days I met hundreds of farmers and I came back with a suitcase full of beans, that's what you need to do to get the best of the best to make chocolate.'

Willie prides himself on buying and producing all his chocolate, or 'bean to bar' as he calls it, buying direct trade and at higher prices to local farmers to ensure quality is better.

'I tweek the fermentation if I need to, it allows me to manufacture the chocolate myself and develop the flavours.'

Willie (pictured) loves to experiment with his chocolate and cacao in cooking including making bread with cacao and adding it to mashed potato or on top of Tuna

'I make in small batches, around seven to 11 days it takes and that enables me to deliver the end product to the consumer at a reasonable price.'

'Simple chocolate to bring out the flavour of the beans. If you don't have good quality you need to add all these things, like sugar and additives.'

One myth he seemed to have debunked is about dark chocolate. He says while most of us associate the dark variety with being bitter, he says that's not the case.

'Dark chocolate isn't bitter, the reason is because the manufacturers are not using good quality beans and it's been heavily roasted.'

The chocolate nut likens real chocolate to a fine wine because each bean has a very different profile and tastes differently.

'For example in Madagascar, they have got a very well know fruity profile which is quite unique and in the last century has developed into it's own flavour through the soil and the climate,' he said.

In Venezuela where he first started his chocolate obsession, he describes the flavours as very interesting while in Rio he says the taste is predominantly coffee and has nutty notes.

With most of Willie's chocolate range has only three ingredients - cacao, natural cacao butter and raw cane sugar, there's no doubt his brown gold will delight fussy foodies and the health conscious.

He believes the health benefits are backed up by research that real chocolate is good for you, full of essential vitamins and minerals for the body.

'There's a really interesting study in the UK that chose my chocolate and found it was high in antioxidants which is good for cardiovascular,' he said.

'It supports my argument over processing that if you over process it, you kill it.'

'I think I tick a lot of the boxes, I like to keep things simple so you get instant gratification when you put it in your mouth.' 

Admitting to a hot chocolate, or Cacao every day, he says there's many different ways you can use cacao in cooking.

'It is an interesting condiment, in cooking its remarkable in savoury or sweet,' he said.

Willie has tried a variety of different dishes including cacao in bread which he dissolves into the dough.

'It comes out a rick dark colour and when toasted brings out a nutty flavour. I add avocado and duck eggs on my toast as well as a mix of cacao and chilli.'

'You can also make gravy and it compliments the flavour or throw in when you are cooking rice, it's a  very soft flavour,' he said.

He's also tried it in mashed potato, grated it on Tuna and made a vegetarian Porcini mushroom risotto.

'It can lift something with a depth of flavour.'

The UK chocolate phenomenon is now in Australia for two weeks to officially launch his luxurious chocolate.

'Willie's Cacao' which is stocked in the UK and shipped to chocolate lovers all over the world, is now available on shelves here, with supermarket giant Coles stocking his products.

'It's a hugely great opportunity for me, it's all about making chocolate and tasting it, I'm on a mission and the mission is so big there's never a point you reach it.'

A small bar of the Peruvian flavoured delight will set you back about $4 for 50 grams while if you want indulgence, you could try the lime and chilli for around $13.

'No chocolate like this in supermarkets, and once you've tasted it the others will be spoilt because you're eating something so good,' he said.

And when asked which flavour was his favourite he was tasked with a big decision, but said it was hard to choose referring to all his creations as his children.

But did admit,' I go through fazes.'
