Scott Quigg has responded to new IBF super-bantamweight champion Carl Frampton's challenge by insisting he would relish the chance to settle their rivalry.

The unbeaten British pair have been constantly linked with a domestic dust-up as their professional careers have continued to soar in the last few years.

Frampton (19-0, 13KOs) raised the stakes over the weekend by defeating Kiko Martinez in his home city of Belfast to take the Spaniard's world title before saying the 'only man' he wants to take on next is Quigg.

The WBA's regular champion will defend his title against late replacement Stephane Jamoye in Manchester on Saturday and should he come through that test as expected, Quigg is keen to take on Frampton in a unification bout, adding he would be happy to face the Northern Irishman in his own backyard if it is the best venue.

'I was pleased to see Carl win the title on Saturday and now it makes perfect sense for us to fight,' said the Bury fighter.

'I'll fight him in Belfast, no problem - but 9,000 in Belfast versus 20,000 in Manchester, it makes more sense to do it there. But if they can find somewhere in Belfast with 20,000 then I can go there, I don't care.

'It's one of the biggest fights in British boxing, it's that big, everyone has an opinion.

'We both think we can win so there's no reason why we shouldn't fight - and I know that I will come out with both belts.'

One sticking point to the bout taking place in the next few months is Frampton has to face the IBF's mandatory challenger Chris Avalos next, meaning an all-British showdown may have to be put on the backburner for the time being.

Quigg's immediate focus is Jamoye, who came in as a late replacement for Paulus Ambunda.

Jamoye has lost two of his last three fights, which included a ninth-round stoppage defeat to Shinsuke Yamanaka for the WBC bantamweight title, but Quigg (28-0-2, 21KOs) is refusing to look past the Belgian with more lucrative fights in the pipeline.

'Jamoye is a very good fighter,' he said. 'He's only 24 but he's been around at a good level for a long time.

'He's boxed for a world title in Japan, he is prepared to travel and travels well, he comes forward and he's got some good names on his CV. He has fallen short at the top level but he would have gained experience from that and will have learned from it.

'To have a late change of opponent again is a shame. We approached nearly every fighter in the division so I give Jamoye plenty of respect for stepping up.

'Boxing always throws up surprises and you have to expect the unexpected, so as long as I am 100 per cent ready, focused and sharp, all I have to do is take care of the guy in the opposite corner, that's the only thing on my mind.'
