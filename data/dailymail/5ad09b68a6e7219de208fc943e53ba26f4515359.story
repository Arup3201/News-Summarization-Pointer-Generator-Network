Floyd Mayweather posted pictures online of the earnings from his last two fights, which were worth over $72million.

Not known for his modesty, the five-division world champion posted the images on his Twitter account. The 37-year-old beat Mexican Saul Alvarez in September last year and in May this year he defeated Argentinian boxer Marcos Maidana.

The pictures showed two cheques -  one worth $31,406,000 (£18,950,672), and the other $40,870,000 (£24,661,337). Meaning his combined income for the two fights came to $72,276,000 (£43,612,009). the pictures were accompanied by the words: 'God bless'.

Meanwhile, Mayweatehr insisted his fight with Amir Khan can still go ahead. 

'He (Khan) knows that the fight between us can still happen,' Mayweather said. 'He is an exciting young fighter - but I don't just fight anybody - they have to prove themselves. 

'If you ask me will the fight happen - then I would say yes. I hope next year - but these fights are always about timing.'

It now appears that Khan could be two fights away from facing the American. Both Khan and Kell Brook may organise fights for December; they would then likely face each other and the winner of that fight could get a shot at Mayweather.
