A boy had to be rescued Tuesday afternoon after falling into a Boston canal, as the city continued digging out from a trio of massive snowstorms.

The child was playing on a snowbank with friends when he lost his footing and slid into the icy Fort Point Channel.

Victor Moisescu, a waiter from Newton, was walking nearby when he heard children screaming for help.

Moisescu called 911 and then jumped into action, sprinting through 50 yards of snow drifts to reach the end of a dock.

The Good Samartian was then able to pull the child, believed to be about 10 years out, out of the frigid water just a few minutes after he fell in, reported the station WBZ. 

The boy was wrapped in someone's jacket to warm him up and taken to a hospital to be evaluated. He is expected to recover. 

Meanwhile, Massachusetts officials called
out National Guard troops Tuesday to help with snow removal, noting that at
least seven roof collapses had been reported as a result of the
heavy accumulation.

The head of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
defended the decision to shut Boston-area subways and rail
service as schools remained closed across much of the area.

Some 500 National Guard troops were to deploy across eastern
Massachusetts to help clear the roughly 6 feet of
snow that has fallen in the past two weeks, Massachusetts
Governor Charlie Baker told reporters.

'We need to get the Commonwealth back to work and we need to
get our kids back to school,' Baker told reporters, adding that
his counterparts in New York and Vermont had agreed to lend
heavy equipment to help with snow removal. Baker also said he
had approved the purchase of two snow-melting machines capable
of melting 120 tons of snow per hour.

The city's rail system will reopen on a limited schedule Wednesday, and public schools will hold classes, Boston Mayor
Marty Walsh told reporters.

'We've been informed that the MBTA will be operating
tomorrow on a limited schedule, as of right now,' Walsh said.

And the region is now out of the woods yet when it comes to winter weather. 

After a brief respite Wednesday, forecasters say much of New England is on track to get more snow Thursday and into the Friday morning commute, with 3 inches expected in Boston and 6 or more south of the city. 

The Thursday weather system is also expected to impact New York City, Albany, Philadelphia, and Hartford, Connecticut. 

A much larger storm could dump appreciably higher amounts Sunday into Monday, but meteorologists said it was still too early to say how much. 

Beverly Scott, general manager of the MBTA, said she had no
choice Monday afternoon but to order all rail services shut
down, an announcement that came right before the evening rush
hour and a few hours before the 7pm shutdown.

'We do not control Mother Nature,' Scott told reporters,
visibly angry about criticism of her handling of the storm.

The train system carries about 950,000 riders on a typical
weekday.

City at a standstill: Schools remained closed across much of the area, but classes were expected to resume Wednesday  

Commuters expressed exasperation at Tuesday's shut-down,
intended to allow crews to clear snow from above-ground tracks
after three trains loaded with commuters were evacuated due to
snow-related troubles.

'I was surprised at the MBTA shutdown. You can't just shut
down the city,' Ariel Freiberg, 32, of Somerville, said as she 
waited at the main train station for an Amtrak train to New
York. The Amtrak service was running at full capacity despite
the MBTA's shutdown.

Heavy snow on tracks had caused trains to lose contact with
the electricity-carrying third rail across the system's 800
miles  of tracks, prompting the shutdown,
Scott said.

Forty-nine-year-old software engineer Steve Holmes
questioned the decision to shut the trains when the city is
struggling to clear roads before another expected snowstorm on
Thursday.

'They're asking people not to drive into Boston, yet they're
shutting down the trains. It doesn't make a lot of sense,' Holmes said.

This has been the area's snowiest 30-day period on record.
Much of eastern Massachusetts has received more than 6 feet of
snow so far this year, making for the ninth snowiest winter on
record.

At least seven roof collapses were blamed on the storm,
including a historic building in Hingham, Massachusetts, south
of Boston. Officials urged owners of buildings with flat roofs
to clear them of snow.

'These roofs are getting heavier and heavier,' Walsh said. 'You don't want a situation with your roof collapsing.'

Walsh said that two school holidays later in the year had
been canceled to make up for lost days and that he was in
negotiation with the city's teachers' union to allow for any
additional snow days.

The repeated snow days were taking a toll on parents. Kelsey
Wirth, 45, a climate change activist who works out of her home,
said she was running out of ideas to occupy her 8- and
9-year-old daughters.

'Work never ends. Even if Boston shuts down, life goes on,' Wirth said. 'When I heard school was closed again, I said, "OK,
today is project day,"' referring to lining up chores for her
children.
