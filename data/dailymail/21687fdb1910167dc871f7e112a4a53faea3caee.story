Olivier Giroud capped off one of the finest team moves of the season when he scored the opening goal against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fifth-round on Sunday. 

The French striker tapped in from close range after some superb Gunners build up play that had seen all 11 Arsenal players touch the ball beforehand.

Arsene Wenger's side have always had a reputation as being one of the best pass and move teams in the country and their talents were on full display at the Emirates.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny started the move with a ball out to debutant Gabriel Paulista before some patient build-up play saw the Gunners switch the ball from left to right and back again.

Some intricate play on the edge of the Middlesbrough box between Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck allowed Santi Cazorla to free Kieran Gibbs who low cross was turned home by the France international.

The move, involving all 11 players, included 19 passes and made its way from Szczesny to the back of the net without a Middlesbrough player touching the ball.

Arsenal are bidding to aim to win the FA Cup for the second consecutive year 

Arsenal ran out 2-0 winners in the end with Giroud scoring the second as well with a well-timed volley from a corner.

The reigning FA Cup holders are now into the last eight of this season's competition and will hope that they can defend their title. 

Arsenal have been criticised for their thin trophy count in recent years and to follow up last year's success with retention would be the perfect way to silence their critics. 

The club are also fifth in the Premier League with 45 points, just two behind third-placed Manchester United, as they compete for Champions League qualification for  the 18th consecutive season.
