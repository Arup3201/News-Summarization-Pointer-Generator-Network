Dele Alli's life is about to change following an eye-catching £5million move to Tottenham Hotspur on transfer deadline day but for the moment the 18-year-old wonderkid is not being treated any differently by his team-mates at MK Dons.

His return to the League One club's training ground after putting pen to paper at Spurs was greeted with good-humoured shouts of 'Can I be your water-boy?' by the other players.

While a reminder has been pinned on the team noticeboard that he still owes a £10 fine for letting his mobile phone go off on the team coach heading to Crewe last weekend.

Alli has impressed for MK Dons this season and attracted interest from a number of top clubs

The MK Dons youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the League One side so far this season 

Second-place MK won that game 5-0 and face leaders Bristol City on Saturday afternoon in Alli's first appearance since making this week's headlines. Spurs have allowed him to play for his hometown club on loan for the rest of the season.

'The lads have had a little wind-up but he's a kid everyone likes and we just want the best for him,' says MK goalkeeper David Martin, who went through something similar when he joined Liverpool as a teenager.

'He's been laughing and joking in training and wanting to score goals. We'll know on Saturday if this week has effected him but I am really confident it won't. He lobbed me in training on Thursday, top corner, and walked away smiling. So it's the same old Dele.'

Alli has done more than anyone in MK Dons' brief history to help present them as something more than a franchise club stolen from Wimbledon.

He is a local boy from Milton Keynes who grew up near the current ground and has been with The Dons since he was 11-years-old. It remains a huge part of his life; he lives with the parents of MK team-mate and best pal Harry Hickford – Harry's dad even accompanied Alli for the medical at Spurs - and one of the reasons he chose to sign for Tottenham rather than Newcastle United or Aston Villa was because he knew their Head of Recruitment, Paul Mitchell, from when he worked in a similar capacity at MK.

Alli has been compared to Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard since making a name for himself at MK Dons

Comparisons have been made between 6ft 2in Alli, who has scored 12 goals from midfield this season, and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard.

Martin, son of former West Ham and England legend Alvin, is in a unique position to judge having spent four years at Liverpool training alongside Gerrard and behind Alli for the last couple of seasons in League One, including a famous 4-0 Capital One Cup victory against Manchester United in August.

'Del has probably got everything you need; height, strength, power and a football brain,' said Martin.

'I've seen him head a corner away from our 18-yard box and finish up in the opposition penalty area scoring a goal, at 18 he's already become one of our main men in the team, and we all know it.

'I remember his first game at 16, he bopped one in the top corner and I wondered if it was a fluke. But the way he's been this season, controlling games and controlling other midfield players who might be in their thirties, has been amazing.

'He just doesn't show any fear. You can't say at this stage he will do everything Stevie has achieved but I will be surprised if he doesn't play for England. And he has a similar personality to Stevie, besides the football. 

'Del is quiet in the dressing-room but if the banter is flying about, he can cut you with a quick one-liner. He has something about him. Calm, cocky and cool!'

A different comparison can be made with Wayne Rooney, who burst onto the scene shortly before his 17th birthday but was regarded as a man-child because of his physical strength and mentality at a young age.

Karl Robinson will be hoping Alli can help MK Dons seal promotion to the Championship 

Alli, the Sky Bet League One Player of the Month for January, has already played 76 first-team games despite not turning 19 until April. He happily plays cards with the older players on away trips and isn't shy on controlling the music on the dressing-room iPod. R&B artist Chris Brown is a personal favourite.

It's his performances in the big games that mark him out as something potentially special.

'In our home game against Swindon, we were losing 1-0 until Del whipped in an equaliser and we ended up winning. He has dug us out so many times, I've seen a lot of young players hit the ground running and then hit a brick wall. But Del is happy to take responsibility,' said Martin.

'I think we all look around before kick off, see Del in the middle and think we'll be alright. Even against Manchester United, he looked so comfortable in that company. And doing a pre-season with Spurs will make him even better with better players around him. It wouldn't surprise me if he is in their team this time next year.'

Martin's own career at Liverpool didn't take off as he'd hoped. With Pepe Reina so consistent as No 1, he went on loan to several clubs including Leicester City and Derby County before rejoining MK Dons.

The goalkeeper wishes he'd have had some of Alli's remarkable inner confidence for such a young player.

'I had butterflies driving up the M6 to sign for Liverpool. When I first saw Steven Gerard in front of me, it took my breathe away, I was in awe. Del would have respected him but on the pitch he wouldn't have thought twice about nutmetting him. He has an ego, he wants to be the best and if an opponent needs sorting out on the pitch, he'll do it.'

In the meantime, the youngster has to cough up his tenner. Even Premier League players have to turn off their mobiles on the MK Dons team coach.
