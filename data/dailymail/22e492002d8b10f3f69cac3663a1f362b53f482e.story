FIFA has suspended Brazil's communications director Rodirgo Paiva from match-day duty for the remainder of the World Cup after he pushed Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla.

Paiva claimed he only shoved the Chile substitute in self-defence when the teams were leaving the pitch at half-time during the last-16 tie.

The Brazilian denied that he threw punches in Belo Horizonte on June 28 and he even accused the Chilean team of 'deplorable conduct'.

He has 
been given a four-match ban - one game which has been back-dated to 
include Brazil's win over Colombia - and a £6,500 fine.

The fourth match, however, is suspended for a two-year probationary period.

The disciplinary panel was believed to have had access to video footage and pictures of the incident in Belo Horizonte.

A scuffle broke out as the teams headed to the dressing rooms in the Mineirao Stadium, sparked by Brazil striker Fred slapping Chile striker Gary Medel on the back of the head as they walked off the pitch.

Brazil media said Paiva and Chile assistant boss Sebastian Beccacece were involved in a confrontation which ended in the Brazil official punching Pinilla.

Paiva told Brazilian reporters there was widespread pushing between the two squads, and said: 'It was not just me. Pinilla came towards me and I just defended myself. I reacted by pushing him.'

Pinilla, who plays for Italian side Cagliari, came off the bench and nearly won the match for Chile but his shot in the last seconds of the match struck the cross-bar.

The striker was then one of three Chile players to miss penalties in the shoot-out which Brazil won 3-2 to go through to the quarter-finals.
