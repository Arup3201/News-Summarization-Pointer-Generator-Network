When it came to her parting sentiments after eight years of employment, typist Jennifer Barkess chose not to mince words.

The 64-year-old was upset that Derby City Council had turned down her request for voluntary redundancy and then asked her to take on the work of two others who had been allowed to leave.

In a fit of rage, she decided to resign then set up an out-of-office reply which said: 'No longer work for the council, p*** off the lot of you'.

Upset: Former council typist Jennifer Barkess said she left the out-of-office email because she hadn't been given voluntary redundancy by Derby City Council

It is understood thousands of people received the email, both at the council and elsewhere.

But it didn't stop there.

After walking out on January 10, Ms Barkess then sent another group email, calling one member of staff 'a lump of canine excrement'.

It said: 'I am told to do the work of people who have got voluntary redundancy, it ain’t gonna happen.'

Ms Barkess has since apologised to council chief executive Adam Wilkinson and says she regrets her actions.

She said: 'We were told before Christmas we could contact the chief executive if we weren't happy if we were told we couldn't go.

'On the actual day I blew up I was told I had to do the work of the girls that had been granted voluntary redundancy. I got a phonecall and I said 'I'm not doing it'. I said I'm resigning as of now.

Disgruntled typist Jennifer Barkess sent the email to thousands of employees at Derby City Council's offices and elsewhere

'I do regret it. My head was going round and round, I'd gone to work on a normal day, I hadn't wanted to go but I've always been a grafter. But half an hour after that I was out. I know I wasn't thinking logically.

'Voluntary redundancy was very important to me, by that stage I was desperate to away from the council.  I'm so glad I'm not working for them any more.'

Regret: Jennifer Barkess said she 'wasn't thinking logically' when she sent the email telling thousands of colleagues to p*** off

Ms Barkess, from Spondon, Derbyshire, 
who worked in the adults, health and housing department, said her 
application for voluntary redundancy was turned down because of 'demands
on the service'.

She said: 'I hadn’t enjoyed it for a long time.

'I
always intended to work until I was 65, which was in July, but it (the 
voluntary redundancy package) would have paid my wages to cover me so I 
could leave earlier.

'They
made two girls in another team redundant and told me to do the work 
they would have been doing if they hadn’t taken voluntary redundancy.'

Derby City Council had asked 
employees to apply for voluntary redundancy as part of plans to shed 350
full-time equivalent posts. It needs to save £62 million over three 
years.

A total of 206 people were approved to take voluntary redundancy and leave by December 31.

Derbyshire police confirmed it had received a complaint about the emails and was investigating.

Karen
Jewel, council director of human resources and business support, said 
of Mrs Barkess: 'We can confirm that this individual is no longer in the
employment of the council. Investigations into the matter are ongoing.'

Council leader Paul Bayliss said it was difficult to accept voluntary redundancies in the adults, health and housing department.

He said: 'In social care we haven’t cut the budget. There’s a requirement for people to deliver these services.'
