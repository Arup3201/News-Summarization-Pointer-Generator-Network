Russell Brand has taken aim at Tony Abbott and Australia's asylum seeker policies.

The British comedian, who has rebranded himself as a political activist, says mandatory offshore detention and resettling asylum seekers in other countries is not in tune with modern-day globalised society.

'Anything where people are sent into camps makes me nervous... the whole mentality of anti-immigration really seems to me like an old-fashioned one and not in tune with a progressive globalised times,' Brand said in a pre-recorded video message.

'I don't reckon he's (Abbott) ever been on an immigration vessel,' he says in a video for his The Trews web series.

Brand's criticism of Australia's Prime Minister comes at a time when his leadership of the country is under threat.

Brand also criticised the fact that journalists were not allowed to enter Australia's detention centres and mocked Abbott for treating the issue like a quiz show.

'He does think it's a quiz show. Tony, why are there even white people in Australia? How did white people get to Australia?'

The 39-year-old argues asylum seekers are not a drain on the country's economy and the government could be tougher on corporate tax evaders if they wanted to increase revenues.

He was especially critical of Rupert Murdoch and his companies, who he says pay too little tax.

'Rupert Murdoch is a refugee of the world. Rupert Murdoch can be a refugee in the Virgin Islands, a refugee in Mauritius ... and not pay tax in Britain and not pay tax in Australia and not pay tax in the United States, but actual refugees ... they can't get no traction, they can't get no satisfaction or opportunities, for them the gates are closed.

'Global corporations treat it (the earth) as a borderless world where they can go where they want and do what they want,' he said.

'But if the poor people of the world, similarly (do so), in search of a better life... then those doors are slammed for them.'

'We should be closing the doors for corporations who already have wealth and affluence and opening the doors to the needy.'

Some Australians registered their support for Brand's views on Twitter.

'@rustyrockets Don't worry, the people in Australia disagree massively with Abbott. He will not be in his position much longer,' @martyaskew said.

This comes as two Liberal backbenchers announced they would move a spill motion against Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday.

Since then, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has stated she would not stand on a ticket with Mr Abbott.

However Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has ruled himself out of contention but Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has not issued a statement.

Mr Abbott will reportedly face a leadership challenge on Tuesday in Canberra

It's the first Liberal leadership challenge since 2009.
