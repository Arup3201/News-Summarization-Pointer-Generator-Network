Standing at a staggering 1,396 feet, it offers breathtaking views of New York, including Central Park, lower Manhattan and the Atlantic Ocean.

This spectacular building is 432 Park Avenue, in midtown Manhattan, which today became the tallest residential site in the Western Hemisphere.

Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, the 96-story condo offers 104 units, ranging in price from $16.95million to a whopping $95million penthouse suite.

Astonishingly, it towers over the Empire State Building (1,250ft), the Chrysler Building (1,046ft) and One World Trade Center without its spire (1,368ft).

This morning CIM Group and Macklowe Properties announced the topping out of the building, which will welcome its first residents next year. 

For those lucky few who can afford to purchase a unit, they will be able to observe the stunning views from sprawling 10-foot-by-10-foot windows.

The units, all built over 365 feet and designed by Deborah Berke, also feature 12.5-foot ceilings, solid oak flooring and Italian marble countertops. 

And the rest of the building is just as impressive - with climate-controlled wine cellars, an outdoor terrace, a spa, a 'massage therapy room' and a pool.

Residents can also frequent a billiards room, dine in a restaurant underneath a crystal chandelier, socialise in a lounge and keep fit in a private gym. 

The building, which sits between 56th and 57th Streets, first underwent excavation work on September 26, 2011, followed by three years of construction.

Today, the final concrete was poured on its highest floor, taking it to its full height of 1,396 feet, ABC reported. It can now be seen from the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and even as far away as Monmouth County in New Jersey. 

Avi Shemesh, the principal and co-founder of CIM Group, said she was delighted the topping of 432 was achieved today, weeks ahead of schedule.
