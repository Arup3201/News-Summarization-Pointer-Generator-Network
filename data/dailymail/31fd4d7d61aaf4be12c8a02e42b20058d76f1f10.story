A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck off the coast of Oregon on Wednesday and was followed a minute later by a smaller quake off the coast of central California.

The tremors came hours after Mexico and Indonesia were hit by powerful earthquakes in an unusually active day for sizable quakes over the 5.0 magnitude rating.

The Oregon quake was initially reported as a magnitude 6.2 and the California one as a 5.3. Both were later downgraded.

No damage or casualties have been reported in the quakes in the United States.

But more than half of the inmates released from a jail in Aceh failed to return today.

Pidie prison released 62 prisoners - convicted of crimes such as murder and drug dealing -  because of tsunami fears, but only 28 of the convicted criminals made their way back today.

The prison insisted that some of the prisoners had called and confirmed they would be returning - they said staff were now beginning to investigate their whereabouts.

The day's largest quake struck off 
the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggering a tsunami watch
for the Indian Ocean, which was later canceled.

The quake struck about 434 kilometers
(270 miles) southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh 
province, and had a magnitude of 8.6, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

A second large quake, with a magnitude of 8.2, occurred off the west coast of Sumatra about two hours later, the USGS said.

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang 
Yudhoyono said on local television that there were no reports of 
casualties or damage in Aceh.

Four people were slightly injured on 
Simeulue Island, off the coast of Aceh, the National Disaster Management
Agency said, reports CNN.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center 
issued a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean. And a few hours 
later, the center announced the tsunami watch was canceled.

'A significant tsunami was generated 
by this earthquake. However, sea level readings now indicate that the 
threat has diminished or is over for most areas,' the center said 
according to CNN.

British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Britain 'stands ready to help if required'.

In Mexico the tremor shook buildings in the capital sending people rushing out of offices onto the streets.

Mexico City mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on his twitter account there were no initial signs of serious damage and that key services in the capital, including its subway system and the international airport, were operating normally.

'There was a nasty crunching sound in my bathroom and everything moved,' said Adela Arceo, who was looking after two young children in the central Roma neighborhood of Mexico City.There were no initial reports of casualties.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake struck in the western state of Michoacan at a depth of 40.8 miles.

The Honolulu-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it had not issued a tsunami warning, but staff oceanographer David Walsh noted the quake was close to water, big enough and potentially deep enough to cause one.
