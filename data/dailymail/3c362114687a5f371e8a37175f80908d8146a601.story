Broadband cables and the trenches dug to carry them may have contributed to the number of trees that fell in the St Jude’s storm, experts said yesterday.

There was speculation that the proliferation of underground communication cables for the internet, phones and TV weakened trees that may have appeared stable above the ground.

Trees brought down by the fierce winds caused four deaths in southern England yesterday, compared with five or six deaths caused by such incidents in an average year. Experts said cable digging has been affecting trees and their root system.

‘When you cut through the roots, it takes a long time for them to grow and get stable again,’ said Dr Trevor Dines of the Plantlife charity.

Concerns grew about the effect of cabling on tree safety as town hall officials were braced for questions about whether they could have done more to prevent the deaths, damage and disruption caused by the trees that fell across the South.

Councils were warned by the Forestry Commission earlier this year that ‘tree-care professionals are increasingly aware of the risks of damage to tree roots from a range of maintenance and construction activities in the urban environment’.

It added: ‘As well as damage from  chemicals such as de-icing road salt and herbicides, roots are killed by physical damage during cable- and pipe-laying  and road alterations, and from soil  compaction or regrading during building construction.

‘In city streets, tree roots are expected to survive in the narrow space between buildings and roads, under solid pavements, and they must grow through a substrate that is often more rubble than soil.’

Dr Dines said digging up roads to lay broadband cables can destabilise trees. ‘There are regulations in place to try to curb and stop that but often it has to happen,’ he said.

Local councils are responsible for the safety of trees on most public ground. Officials are expected to foresee reasonable risks and pay special attention to ‘zone one’ trees, which are passed by large numbers of people every day.

These should be regularly examined by ‘a person with a working knowledge of trees’ to check for signs of whether they are unstable. The inspectors, however, are not required to be professionals qualified in tree safety.

Pauline Buchanan Black of the Tree Council said local authorities are ‘very diligent’ about looking after trees that are a danger.

'Whatever happens, we are not going to be able to be properly prepared. You can’t batten down the hatches on the landscape'

‘People need to remember that when trees are blown down and fall across train lines, these trees are often not on railway land to begin with, they are on land neighbouring the railway,’ she said.

‘Whatever happens, we are not going to be able to be properly prepared. You can’t batten down the hatches on the landscape.’

Simon Richmond of the Arboricultural Association there is ‘no direct correlation’ between councils cutting back on tree maintenance budgets and trees falling in yesterday’s storm.

‘Budgets have been cut for this and so many other services and that has reduced the amount of maintenance work that is carried out. But trees are very long lived and changes take a long time to have results.’

He added that there is no evidence that trees are less stable than they used to be. Urban development may make it more difficult for trees to put down extensive root systems, he said, but they can adapt to grow in extremely difficult conditions.

'Councils were well prepared for the worst storms in 25 years and have pulled out all the stops in the aftermath to clear the road network'

Local Government Association spokesman

Trees growing in an area with a strong prevailing wind tend to have their roots concentrated on one side and so are particularly likely to fall if their roots are disturbed.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association which represents councils said: ‘Councils were well prepared for the worst storms in 25 years and have pulled out all the stops in the aftermath to clear the road network, get vulnerable residents the help they need and ensure life returns to normal as swiftly as possible.’

It is thought that thousands of trees were brought down by the St Jude’s storm, but it does not match the level of destruction in the Great Storm of 1987. Then, 15million trees are thought to have fallen, causing 18 deaths.
