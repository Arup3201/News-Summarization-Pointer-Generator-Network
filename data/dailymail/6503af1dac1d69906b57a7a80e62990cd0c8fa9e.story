Network Rail is to plead guilty on Tuesday in a criminal prosecution brought against it over the tragic death of two teenage girls at an unmanned level crossing, rail bosses told the father of one of the victims last night.

Best friends Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were killed after being hit by a train at the level crossing in the Essex village of Elsenham as they went Christmas shopping in December 2005.

Rail watchdogs launched a criminal prosecution against Network Rail in November. Network Rail could face fines of up to £1million. Any conviction could also have implications for thousands of rail crossings across the country.

Olivia’s father Chris Bazlinton said last night: ‘Network Rail have told us they will be pleading guilty this Tuesday 31 January 2012 to criminal charges brought by the Office of Rail Regulation in November 2011’.

He added:’The case will be heard at Basildon Magistrates Court probably in front of a district judge who will pass it on to the Crown Court for sentencing this spring/early summer.  This is unlikely to be the end of the matter as there are still many unanswered questions which we will be pursuing.’

Mr Bazlinton added that rail crossing safety was still a big issue: ‘Sadly, yesterday a 15 year old girl died on a crossing in Bishops Stortford about three miles south of Elsenham - there was a previous death there ten years ago.’

The prosecution over the deaths on the Liverpool Street to Cambridge line is being brought by the Office for Rail Regulation under Health and Safety legislation and follows a row over an alleged cover-up concerning risk assessment reports into the crossing.

The families of the two girls believe Network Rail deliberately suppressed a risk assessment report into the crossing carried out three and a half years before the accident. This had recommended that the pedestrian gates be locked when trains approach.

The deaths of Olivia and Charlotte sparked a huge safety controversy over thousands of railway crossings. The pedestrian crossing at Elsenham had ‘wicket’ gates which, unlike the road crossing gates, were never locked as trains approached.

On December 3, 2005, the girls used Elsenham station footpath crossing - owned and operated by Network Rail - to reach the station platform.

The teenagers had been to the ticket office and were dashing it catch their train before it left. The station's footpath crossing was fitted with warning lights and ‘yodel’ alarms.

A London to Cambridge train passed over the crossing with the red lights and yodel alarm sounding - a warning for foot passengers not to cross the footpath crossing.

After the train passed, the lights remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, travelling to Stansted airport in Essex, was going to pass through the station.

Opening a pedestrian gate, they walked into the path of the 7.24am express from Birmingham New Street to Stansted and died instantly.

Olivia had celebrated her 14th birthday just days before the accident. She and Charlotte, from Thaxted, both attended Newport Free Grammar School. They were described by friends as ‘lovely, lively girls.’

The father of Olivia - known to her family as Liv and who would have been celebrating her 20th birthday next Monday - welcomed the action by the Office of Rail Regulation. Chris Bazlinton said: ‘I’m very happy the prosecution will be going ahead.

‘They have discussed it with us and told us what they are planning.’

He said it was right that people ‘will be brought to account’ adding: ‘We never felt that we had heard the whole story. Back in 2006, when the various inquiries were held, there seemed to be unanswered questions, and we were very disappointed with the inquest, at which Network Rail’s lawyers squashed discussion on rail safety.

‘We are pleased that ORR has decided to take action. None of this will bring back Liv or Charlie but, hopefully, other families will not have to go through what we have.’

The rail regulator said Network Rail two charges under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 adding: ‘These result from Network Rail’s failure to carry out proper assessments of the risks to the safety of members of the public using the footpath crossing or to have in place adequate arrangements to underpin these assessments.’

The rail regulator re-opened its investigation into the deaths of the two teenage girls in February when new evidence – in the form of a previously unseen document - emerged about Network Rail’s risk assessments into the gates.

The company has denied suppressing the document. But it was never seen by the girls’ families, the coroner who investigated the deaths, the rail regulator or government inspectors from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

The risk assessment only came to light after the settlement in January of a civil case against Network Rail. The company did not mount a defence and settled with the families out of court.

Mr Bazlinton said at the time: ‘We are very glad that Network Rail is now being prosecuted. What is appalling is that key information was withheld not just from us but from the coroner and the rail regulator.

‘Network Rail’s risk assessment strategy was appalling. It failed them. It failed the public, it failed us, it failed Olivia and Charlotte. They behaved appallingly and they lied. It is right there should be retribution.’

In August 2006 Network Rail reversed its opposition to locking the gates.

A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report in December described the risk assessment, carried out by Network Rail in April 2005 before the accident, as ‘substantially flawed’. It recommended locking the pedestrian gates at Elsenham and for a footbridge to be built.

An inquest held in January 2007 recorded a verdict of accidental death.

In late 2008 Olivia’s mother, Tina Hughes, launched a civil case against Network Rail on behalf of herself and her first daughter Stephanie Bazlinton, now 22, alongside a similar case by Charlotte’s father Reg Thompson on behalf of his family.

Network Rail did not submit any evidence in its defence and an out-of-court settlement was agreed in November 2010. The maximum payment for a fatality is £10,000 plus expenses which in the case of a child is limited to the cost of the funeral.

ORR's railway safety director Ian Prosser said at the time of the prosecution in November: ‘After careful consideration and examination of Network Rail documents not previously seen by ORR, we have concluded that there is enough evidence, and that it is in the public interest, to bring criminal proceedings against Network Rail for serious breaches of health and safety law which led to the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton and Charlotte Thompson at Elsenham station footpath crossing in December 2005.

‘Legal papers have been lodged at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today.’

Mr Prosser added: ‘My thoughts are with the families of Olivia and Charlotte. ORR will do everything it can to ensure that the prosecution proceeds as quickly as possible.’

Network Rail chief executive David Higgins said in November: ‘This was a deeply tragic event. Since this accident in 2005 we have launched a major programme to update the assessments of all our 7,000 level crossings, improving risk management and safety, and we have closed over 500 crossings since 2009.’
