Daniel Rye Ottosen was held for 13 months by Isis and was freed after a ransom was paid

A freed Isis hostage is making a desperate plea for cash in a Facebook campaign that reveals he is saddled with 'overwhelming debts' after paying a huge ransom for freedom.

Daniel Rye Ottosen, who was held for 13 months with the Americans and Britons beheaded by Jihadi John, was freed after a secret fundraising campaign by his family and friends.

The move is controversial because the four men were executed after the Obama and Cameron administrations refused to give in to demands to trade their lives for cash - and Britain claims it is against the law to pay ransoms.

But in the dramatic appeal for money on Facebook, Daniel's older sister Anita Rye Ottosen confirms that a huge sum was paid for her brother's release in June.

She writes: 'Daniel struggles every day -- a struggle to make sense of the violent experiences and find his way back to normal life.

'Daniel's situation right now limits his ability to earn money, and he therefore hopes that anyone interested will be able to help him.'

Jihadi John savagely executed his four fellow hostages – US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and the UK aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning – after the Obama and Cameron administrations told the families not to give in to a blitz of death threats.

The Danish government claims it has a similar policy. In a statement to MailOnline, a British Foreign Office spokesman said it was against international law to pay ransom to terrorists.

US Journalist James Foley, who was held alongside Daniel Rye Ottosen, was apparently beheaded in a video on August 19 

Briton David Haines was apparently beheaded in a video released on September 13 

However, in her Facebook posting, Anita, a 32-year-old engineer, appears to confirm that ISIS spared Daniel in return for ransom. Danish Press reports have said the fee was paid with the help of a private security firm.

She writes: 'On Thursday, June 19, 2014, my little brother, Daniel Rye, was released after 13 tough months as a hostage in Syria.

'Due to the circumstances, Daniel did not go public (about this), which is why I have chosen to do so on his behalf.

'A secret collection, started by Daniel's family and friends , allowed Daniel's release.

'Unfortunately, the total cost to get Daniel released proved to be higher than the amount already collected. Daniel is therefore obliged to ask for an extra helping hand, so he is not left alone with debts of around 1 million kroner (£86,000).

'Throughout this collection, we have used the motto 'many small, makes a big river' and the hope is that many small contributions can make a big difference, so Daniel can concentrate on getting back to life in the best possible way and without for the rest of that life having to contend with overwhelming debts on top of the psychological challenges.'

US journalist Steven Sotloff was apparently beheaded in a video released on September 2, while former British taxi driver Alan Henning was killed at the beginning of October 

The New York Times alleged yesterday that Daniel was freed suddenly after his family 'cobbled together a multimillion-euro ransom.' A Danish newspaper, Ekstra Bladet, estimated the amount at about £1.3 million.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Anita confirmed that Daniel is drowning in debt. As of October 17, the Facebook appeal has brought in only about £25,300 towards the £86,000 shortfall.

'I do not have much confidence in getting there. I actually don't think we can collect as much,' she said.

Daniel was kidnapped just three days after he went to Syria, where he planned to photograph the suffering of refugees from the civil war.

Last spring, the militants shot dead a Russian who was one of his fellow hostages, Sergey Gorbunov. 'They filmed his body. Then they returned to show the footage to the surviving hostages,' The New York Times reported.

Daniel also is said to have witnessed the torture of another cellmate, James Foley, who was waterboarded and subjected to mock executions. 

Anita Rye Ottosen, Daniel's older sister, is co-ordinating a Facebook campaign to raise money to repay the debts he has incurred by apparently paying off a ransom to Isis 

 After his release, he telephoned Mr Foley's mother, Diane, to pass on a letter that the despairing American had asked him to memorise. Mrs Foley visited Copenhagen to meet him. Just a week later, James became the first hostage to be beheaded on camera by the masked Londoner known as Jihadi John.

In a grief stricken TV interview, she said that the Obama administration threatened to prosecute her family if they paid ransom for him.

A spokesman for the Sotloff family claimed they received similar threats.

President Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said that under a US counterterrorism law, it would have been illegal to for either family to have paid the group money. 'We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,' he said.

A Foreign Office spokesperson told MailOnline that the UK has a similar law. 'The UK Government's policy of not making or facilitating substantive concessions to hostage-takers, including the payment of ransoms, is long standing and clear,' he said.

'Not paying ransoms to terrorists prevents millions of pounds reaching terrorists. Ransoms fuel the cycle of terrorist violence and encourage further kidnappings.'

He added: 'In the case of terrorist kidnaps, it is illegal to pay ransoms to terrorists under UK and international law.'

A Cameron administration insider elaborated that under two United Stations resolutions – the most recent of which was affirmed in 2012 – it is illegal for member states, including Denmark, to pay ransom to ISIS.

Denmark has an 'obligation,' the insider claimed, to enforce this law and 'prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments.'

Anita declined to comment when asked if the Danish government had given its blessing to the payment that secured her brother's release. 

The senior public diplomacy and press attache for Denmark's US Embassy refused to respond to MailOnline's questions about whether ransom money was illegally paid by Daniel's family, saying 'as a matter of principle, the Danish authorities do not comment on hostage cases.'

She added: 'The Danish government does not negotiate with hostage-takers and does not pay ransoms.'
