A British teenager died on a university study visit to Germany after her drink was allegedly spiked at a carnival.

Jane Khalaf, 19, was rushed to hospital and put on a life-support machine but she never recovered and died eight days later. Ecstasy and amphetamines were found in her system.

Her distraught parents said she was vehemently anti-drugs and her friends said she never took them. 

Jane Khalaf collapsed and died after telling friends that someone had spiked her drink during a carnival she went to while on exchange in Germany

They have accused German police of failing to investigate Jane’s death properly and of keeping them in the dark.

Their MP, Barry Sheerman, raised the case in the Commons yesterday, saying: ‘A young girl in my constituency has been tragically murdered in Cologne. There is no police investigation although there is every evidence that her drink was spiked – she was poisoned.’

The politics and history student at Northumbria University had completed only six weeks of her course in western Germany when she died on November 20. She had been on a night out with friends at the city’s annual carnival.

Her family is planning legal action against the police and the hospital where their daughter was treated. They didn’t tell us anything,’ said Jane’s mother Rojin, 40. ‘They said they weren’t interested and wouldn’t be looking into the case.

‘It’s like my daughter doesn’t matter to them. It is disgraceful and we have been shown no compassion by them. We still don’t know what happened that night.’

Her parents have hit out at German authorities after they were only informed of her illness through Facebook

She said the hospital – the Cologne City Clinic – took six days to tell them what had happened to their ‘brilliant and ambitious’ daughter and initially failed to take blood tests even though Jane told them her drink had been spiked.

Mrs Khalaf added: ‘When I saw her in hospital we were beside ourselves. No one can prepare a parent for this.’

Jane’s father, Khalil, 57, who owns a restaurant in their hometown of Huddersfield, said: ‘My daughter was so anti-drugs. Yes, she was 19, but she was sensible.’

Jane’s best friend Charlotte Lewis, who flew out to Germany with the family, said: ‘Jane couldn’t have been more against drugs.

She would stay away from people she knew who were meddling with stuff like that.

Her parents paid tribute to their 'angel' daughter today, who they said was 'intelligent, ambitious and funny'

‘A few weeks before she died she sent me a text saying she was worried one her friends in Cologne was doing drugs. She hated to see what they turned people into.’

Miss Khalaf’s body has been flown back to the UK where a post-mortem examination will be carried out. The teenager had a sister, 16-year-old Naze, and a brother Kevin, nine. Their parents fled unrest in Syria in 1978.

A spokesman for Northumbria University said: ‘We can confirm that one of our students has tragically passed away while studying at a partner university in Germany.’

Prosecutors in Germany say an investigation has been carried out and they are due to receive a file on the case today.
