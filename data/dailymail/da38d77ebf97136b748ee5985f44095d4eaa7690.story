Calvin Payne says you can learn a lot about history from studying drain covers

A Yorkshireman has been named Britain's only 'drain spotter' after spending his time scouring the streets for rare sewer covers.

Calvin Payne, 42, spends hours visiting hundreds of drains - recording them with his camera and chronicling their history.

Dubbed 'The Sherlock of the Sewers', Calvin's hobby sees him visiting drains around his home city of Sheffield and further beyond.

He admits his hobby is unusual and 'quirky', but insists it is 'not as boring as trainspotting'.

Calvin's
 passion was first ignited several years ago and since then he has since
 become obsessed - and is now thought of as Britain's first drain spotter.

He is also part of local preservation group called 'Streets Ahead' who work hard to retain heritage features.

Calvin
 said: 'You can get in a spot of trouble - me and a friend crawled under
 a car once to take a look at a drain and I guess what we were doing 
could have been misconstrued.

'I
 like doing this because it's quirky but it's also important. If these 
drains were to disappear in a road resurfacing scheme it would be very 
disappointing. We honestly aren't as boring as trainspotters.'

Calvin's
 passion was sparked one day when he was walking down a street in 
Sheffield and he noticed three metal grates embossed with words 'Sheffield 
Local Board.'

Mr Payne has taken pictures of scores of drains as part of his unusual hobby

Baffled
 by the name he eventually tracked down the company to 1838 during the 
cholera outbreak - meaning the drains were evidence of one of the first 
modern sanitation systems.

He said: 'We have reason to believe these were installed in the late 1840s. They're certainly around 160 years old.

'Once you start looking down at the streets, you soon come across plenty of lasting relics of times gone by.

'For example, there are still cut-off poles and electric access points for the old tramway, which closed in 1956.

Mr Payne says some drain covers have fascinating links with history and has traced some back to an 1838 cholera outbreak

Despite some suggesting his obsession is boring - he insists it is more interesting than trainspotting

'And
 there is a National Telephone Company Ltd cover which dates back to a 
time when there were just 12 telephones in Sheffield.'

Calvin
 added: 'You're more likely to see something ornate or interesting if 
it's in your eyeline. If it's on the ground it's not so obvious.'

Commenting
 on drains in the area, local councillor Jack Scott said: 'We are 
restoring a number of old sewer gas street lamps and retaining old stone
 features, such as kerbs, where we can.

'We
 are upgrading road drainage across the city to reduce road flooding 
and, unfortunately, this will involve replacing many of the old gully 
grates.

'We
 need to do this because, whilst the old ones are solidly built, they 
are prone to blocking, are difficult to maintain and can create problems
 for cyclists.'
