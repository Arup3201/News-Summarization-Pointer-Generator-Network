It appears British holidaymakers like to cram in as many sights as they can when they head abroad.

New research reveals that the typical city break lasts three nights with travellers taking in five attractions – more than they would over the course of a year in their hometown.

But trying to pack it all into just a few nights doesn’t cut it as Brits admit they often need more time away to tick everything off their itinerary. One in three (31 per cent) have extended their break as a result. 

The city that never sleeps: New York ranks as the number one dream destination for British holidaymakers

The bright lights and endless activities of New York are always a popular draw for British tourists so it’s no surprise that the Big Apple ranks as the number one dream destination.

Of those polled in the lastminute.com survey, 27 per cent of respondents put New York at the top of their list.

Barcelona (23 per cent) came in second place on the list of the top cities that Brits want to visit, followed by Amsterdam (20 per cent), Rom (19 per cent) and Venice (18 per cent). 

But whether these dream trips become reality is another thing.

Travellers have their reasons for heading abroad for a few days, but it appears a long weekend in an international city is often the refuge of the heartbroken.

Eight per cent of those polled admitted they will go on a city break to help them to get over an ex, while seven per cent said they have booked a trip in a desperate bid to save a rocky relationship.

The study of 2,000 Brits revealed the average number of local attractions we visit in and around our home town during a year is just four.
