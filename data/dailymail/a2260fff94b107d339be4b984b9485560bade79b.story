Swansea have been told St Etienne target Franck Tabanou is going nowhere by the Ligue 1 club's president Bernard Caiazzo.

It emerged on Tuesday that Swansea were keen to sign the versatile former France Under-21 international, who can operate on either the left side of defence or in attack.

Tabanou's agent Philippe Lamboley said: 'The two clubs are in discussions, but I cannot confirm a bid has been made.'

But St Etienne president Caiazzo has dismissed talk of Tabanou making a £3million move to south Wales and says the player will be staying put at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard to help the club's push for Champions League football.

St Etienne currently lie fourth in Ligue 1, four points behind third-placed Paris St Germain.

'Tabanou will not leave this winter', Caiazzo told Eurosport.

'Even if we receive a good offer, he will stay at the club for sure.'

Swansea, who sold top scorer Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in a deal which could climb to £28million through add-ons, are still looking to strengthen their defence despite the £5m capture of full-back Kyle Naughton from Tottenham last week.

Manager Garry Monk wants to provide competition for Neil Taylor as the Wales defender is the only recognised left back at the club and he has also been linked with a January move for Norwich's Swedish international Martin Olsson.
