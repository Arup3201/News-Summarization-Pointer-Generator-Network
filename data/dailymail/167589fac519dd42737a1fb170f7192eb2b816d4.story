Health experts assembled by the White House conceded on Friday that a second case of Ebola could be identified in the U.S. But they defiantly insisted that the epidemic plaguing western Africa will not rise to the level of a major American outbreak.

The deaths of approximately 3,500 people in western African nations are due to lax public health procedures and infrastructure – problems the United States doesn't face – according to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Obama's homeland security assistant Lisa Monaco, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Raj Shah.

Fauci and Monaco specifically said there's no guarantee the sole American-diagnosed case of the illness in Texas will be the only one.

'We have a case now, and it's entirely conceivable there will be another case,' said Fauci.

Biosecurity, Liberia style: Western African nations are woefully unprepared to contain the Ebola virus, experts said, without directly addressing the lapses that landed a single patient in Texas

'But the reason that we feel confident is that our structure, our ability to do those things, would preclude an outbreak,' he said.

Fauci told reporters that the African pandemic has erupted 'because the health care infrastructure and system' in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea 'is inadequate and incapable of actually handling the kind of identification, isolation, rapid treatment, protection of the people who are coming into contact, and contact tracing.'

'That's something that we have very, very well established here,' he declared.

Monaco echoed him minutes later, saying that 'it is entirely possible we will see another case.'

But the overall feeling of the sparsely attended afternoon press conference was one of complacency, with the Obama administration's top Ebola spear-catchers saying over and over that Americans have nothing to fear even though the government has no plans to close airports to planes originating in at the disease's ground-zero.

'The American people should be confident,' Monaco said, 'because the public health infrastructure we have here is so expert, is so extensive, and is considerable.' 

That confidence could come back to haunt the administration if a series of potential Ebola cases in Maryland, Hawaii, Kentucky and the District of Columbia turn out to be anything but false alarms.

Fauci acknowledged that the fear associated with the virus, which kills more than half of the people it infects, will be a formidable public-relations obstacle if the situation worsens.

'There are many things when you have outbreaks,' he said. 'It's the unknown. It's the cataclysmic nature of it – namely, it's acute, it kills in a high percentage, and it kills quickly. That in and of itself, almost intuitively, makes people frightened.'

He imagined his response to panicked Americans left wondering if they might be next.

'The other thing that makes people frightened,' he said, is: '"Can this happen to me without my even knowing it? Without my having any behavioral change at all?"'

'And that's the kind of thing that we have to keep over and over again emphasizing: We respect your concern, we understand your concern, but the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen. And we have to say that a lot.'

Fauci found himself pushing back against incredulous reporters who demanded to know why biosecurity lapses in the Texas case wouldn't repeat themselves. 

Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, conceded that the lone Ebola case in Texas might not be the last

The patient lied on his exit paperwork when he left Liberia, saying he hadn't been in contact with any contagious Ebola patients. In fact, he had carried a violently convulsing pregnant woman to safety only a day earlier.

Once in the U.S., the first hospital that saw him sent him home with antibiotics after a clinician failed to note he had recently traveled to Texas from Africa.

And it took more than two days for a hazardous materials crew to clean up the apartment where the man was staying after he was finally secured in an isolation ward.

'I never say I'm not concerned,' Fauci responded, 'because that's interpreted as taking something lightly. I take nothing lightly.'

'But I'm convinced,' he said 'that the system that's in place, with our health care infrastructure, that it would be extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.'

Speaking to journalists aboard Air Force One during a fundraising trip, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has no immediate plans to respond personally to Americans' Ebola fears with a speech to soothe their nerves.

'Are we going to hear from him at all on the Ebola issue?' one reporter asked.

'Today, you mean?' Earnest responded. 'I don't anticipate that you will today.'
