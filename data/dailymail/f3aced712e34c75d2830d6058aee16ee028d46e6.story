Santi Cazorla says Arsenal's FA Cup win last year has made him hungry for silverware, and the midfielder has set his sights on the Premier League and the Champions League.

Arsene Wenger ended his nine-year wait for a trophy last season, seeing off a stubborn Hull City side in the FA Cup final to win in extra time, and it has lit a spark in the Gunners.

None more so than in Cazorla, who is adamant that Arsenal can be crowned kings of Europe.

'We hope to win more trophies - I want to win the Premier League or Champions League,' Cazorla said at the launch of the club’s new PUMA kits, as reported by Goal.

'Of course we can win. We have a good team and with the support of the fans it's important for us.

'We have high expectations to go better than last year. We won a trophy last year and we want to do it again.

'Hopefully we'll make some great signings to support the squad and if so, it'll be good.'

And Cazorla singled out Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey as leading figures in the Arsenal team.

'I'm very happy to have Ozil next to me,' Cazorla said. 'We have a very special relationship.

'He makes it very easy for me. Obviously he'll help the team to improve next season.

'It wasn’t a surprise to see Ramsey developing into his role - I trained for two years with him and saw him develop. He’s a great player and we have big expectations for him.

'We had a couple of injuries and it was hard to keep up with Manchester City but we have a stronger squad and deeper team now, with more players to use, and hopefully not as many injuries individually.'
