Bahia Bisharat, 19, disappeared on March 19

The mother of a missing nursing student has pleaded for her daughter's safe return.

Bahia Bisharat, 19, disappeared on March 19 at St. Charles Community College near St. Louis, and her car was found in the parking lot along with a handwritten note.

Her mother Munira Quader said: 'There are no clues. I don't know exactly what happened to her.

'I hope whoever took her will think twice and just be nice and just bring my daughter back,' she said reported ABC.

Ms Quader said she does not think the note was written in her daughter's handwriting.

Bahia was last seen at the college, although she did not make it to class, police say.

A witness described her as 
appearing fidgety and nervous.

On Saturday hundreds of volunteers took part in a search for the student, scouring parts of Busch Wildlife Preserve.

'I imagine her screaming and yelling all the time. That's in my head all the time, but I hope she's safe,' Ms Quader said.

'We can't rest until we find her,' said her brother, Oday Bisharat.

Ms
 Quader says her daughter had a Samsung computer tablet and a debit 
card, but neither has been in use since before she disappeared.

The five-foot-ten, 140 pound student has dark hair and brown eyes and she is reportedly not involved with any known boyfriend.

'Investigators still have hope she may be alive,' said Sheriff’s Department spokesman David Tiefenbrunn.

'There’s no evidence of an abduction at this time.'

Police have filed several subpoenas, hoping to get access to Bisharat's social media and email accounts.
