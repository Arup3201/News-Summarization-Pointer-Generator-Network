Today is the first day of July, Wimbledon is still in full flow and the schools have not yet broken up.

But while we enjoy the pleasures of mid-summer, nature is already racing ahead towards autumn.

Our fields, woodlands and hedgerows are already displaying signs of change they would not usually expect to see until August or September, conservationists say.

After an early spring and summer, plants and animals are well ahead of the seasons.

Hawthorn
 berries are already turning red, holly berries are ripening, and beech 
and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule.

National Trust naturalist Matthew Oates said: 'Looking at this year, where does it want to be? It raged its way through winter, then we went into an incredibly early spring, and then it rushed helter-skelter through spring without stopping for breath.'

This year blackbirds have already stopped singing, butterflies such as purple emperors arrived a month early and bees have been thriving on nectar from early flowers.

Our remarkably mild weather over the last few months seems to have accelerated the seasons.

Each of the last seven months has seen warmer-than-average temperatures, according to the Met Office.

Britain had the third hottest spring since records began, three months of warm temperatures which triggered the flourishing of plants and wildlife.

And June has been the sixth warmest since records began in 1910, around 1.4C above average.

Mr Oates said: 'We're remarkably ahead, birds have largely stopped singing, a lot of butterflies are very early and are still coming out early.

'There are 
really strong signs of autumn already here, like the beech nuts, it' s 
an amazing beech mast year and the nuts are incredibly well developed.'

He
 also said sycamore seeds were well developed and hawthorn and holly 
berries were already red - changes that usually would not be seen until 
September.

The
 RSPB said people may begin to see more thrushes, blue tits and sparrows
 in our hedgerows over the coming weeks as they come to feed on the 
early berries.

A
 spokesman said: 'Most birds will be feeding on insects and worms at the
 moment, and when they run out or the ground gets baked too hard for the
 birds to get them then they will move on to berries.

'Blackbirds,
 thrushes, blue tits and sparrows will all eat hawthorn berries and 
other hedgerow berries but we haven't seen big signs of them making the 
switch just yet.'

Many plants and animals suffered during the winter storms that blasted Britain during December, January and February.

But the mild weather since has greatly aided their recovery.

Full swing: Crowds arrive at Wimbledon yesterday. It feels like the start of summer, but could it soon be over?

Dr
 Kate Lewthwaite of the Woodland Trust said: 'Our landscape is 
incredibly resilient in the face of natural and man-made threats and has
 responded fantastically since the battering it took over the winter. 
Records would suggest summer is in full swing but that autumn is just 
around the corner.

'Nature is 
always on the march and in July I'd encourage people to keep their eyes 
open for the first signs of autumn such as the first ripe blackberries.'

Mr
 Oates added: 'If we go back to that winter, it was the wettest, 
stormiest, wildest winter, and very stressful for every living thing, 
including us, but wildlife seems to have come through it incredibly 
well.

'There
 are always winners and losers. At the moment there seem to be far more 
winners than losers, though we must remember a lot of our wildlife is in
 a pretty beleaguered state.'

Despite
 the generally good situation, Mr Oates raised concerns about low 
numbers of butterflies such as cabbage whites and the scarcity of bees 
and many flying insects.

More
 positively, some species of insect may be able to fit in an extra brood
 because they are so far ahead for the year, he said.

And
 an early autumn would not spell problems for wildlife, he said, so long
 as creatures such as squirrels and dormice have the chance to fatten up
 before winter set in.

What a difference a few months make! The Somerset Levels were flooded for months in a harsh, stormy winter - but each of the last seven months has seen warmer-than-average temperatures
