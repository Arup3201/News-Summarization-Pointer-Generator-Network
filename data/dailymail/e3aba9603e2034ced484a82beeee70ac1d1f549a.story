Parents Glyn Rostron, 38, and Michelle Duffy, 32, (pictured outside Bolton Crown Court) both pleaded guilty to child cruelty

A couple have been spared jail because a court was unable to prove which of them broke their baby’s arm.

Glyn Rostron, 38, and Michelle Duffy, 32, pleaded guilty to child cruelty for failing to seek medical help for their five-week-old son Thurston after his injury.

But neither took responsibility for the ‘nasty fracture’ to his right arm.

Handing them both a suspended jail sentence at Bolton Crown Court, Judge Timothy Clayson said: ‘One of you caused that injury and the two  of you put your own interests ahead of that of your son.

‘That is an attitude which is abhorrent to all right-minded people.’

Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, told the court the baby was taken to A&E on December 1, 2012. Duffy told nurses he had not been moving his arm for a few days.

X-rays revealed both bones in his lower arm were broken. Doctors concluded the injury could not have happened accidentally and the couple, from Bolton, were arrested.

They told police that Rostron, a bakery worker, had been out ‘wetting the baby’s head’ when he got a call from his partner saying the little boy’s arm was floppy and he was unable to grab.

They said that his mother took him to hospital later that evening.

The couple said no one else had been alone with the baby and neither could offer any explanation for the injury. But on December 21, Rostron contacted a social worker and said  he may have caused the break two days before Thurston was taken  to hospital.

He claimed he had accidentally knelt on the child’s arm as he lay on the bed during a night-time feed.

Miss Thomson said that the account was unlikely to be true because doctors believed the injury had been caused by a direct blow or snapping force up to ten days before Thurston was taken to A&E. She said it would have been obvious that the baby was in pain.

Jane Dagnall, defending, said Duffy is now considering having herself sterilised after Thurston and a second child, born last year, were taken into care.

She told the court: ‘It is punishment that she has no children with her.’

Peter Cunliffe, for Rostron, said he was a hard worker with no previous convictions.

Judge Clayson told the pair: ‘You will no longer have the pleasure of bringing up not only your young son, but also the other child. That is serious punishment indeed.’

He sentenced them both to five months’ 
imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. They will also be subject to six 
months’ supervision, and must each pay £400 costs and a £100 victim 
surcharge.

CPS guidelines say the sentence for an assault on a child should be between 26 weeks and two years in jail.

Kama
 Melly, a barrister specialising in cases involving children, said if it
 had been proved which parent had broken Thurston’s arm, they would have
 been jailed.She added: ‘You would absolutely expect an immediate 
custodial sentence for anyone who inflicted that sort of injury on a 
defenceless child.

‘But in assaults on very young children, who are not able to speak, it is very hard to prove who did it.’

Last
 year, a young mother who had refused to take medication for post-natal 
depression was  spared prison after killing her  six-week-old daughter.

Natasha Sultan, 21, struck Amelia-Lilly Sultan Curtis on the head after losing her temper while feeding her.

She then went to bed instead of calling for an ambulance and later lied that she had tripped and dropped the baby.

Hull
 Crown Court heard she had been prescribed antidepressants but had taken
 only  one because of the ‘stigma’ attached to post-natal depression. 
Sultan pleaded guilty to infanticide but instead of jail she was given a
 three-year supervision order and was banned from working with children.

The court heard any children she had in future would probably be taken 
into care.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said Sultan had been in a 
‘maelstrom of fatigue and mental disorder’.

He told her: ‘Your actions 
were not of a calculating cruel woman, rather, an uncontrolled explosion
 born from a disturbance of mind associated  with childbirth.’
