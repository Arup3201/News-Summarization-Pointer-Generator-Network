Extremist group Boko Haram launched a fierce assault on a Nigerian town today and warned people they face being killed if they vote in the country's upcoming elections.

As the militants attacked the town of Gombe, clashing with ground troops, they distributed papers warning that they will attack all polling stations on March 28.

Boko Haram left the town in a convoy of vehicles carrying dozens of corpses, according to residents.

'They were heard telling our people in the villages leading to Gombe that they have not come to harm civilians but the security agents,' said resident Malam Hassan.

'They were also dropping copies of papers with messages written in Hausa warning people not to participate in the coming elections, lest they risk being killed.' 

The message warns that Boko Haram fighters will attack all polling stations on March 28.

The paper also said residents should not assist the army and pledged that extremist fighters would not attack those who stayed out of its fight against the government. 

'We are calling on you all to come and join us in the Jihad and embrace Islamic Sharia jurisprudence,' the paper urged.

On February 7, Nigeria announced it was pushing back planned presidential and legislative elections by six weeks to March 28, because of insecurity. 

Soldiers on the ground in Gombe were backed up by two fighter jets, witnesses said. 

Gombe has previously been attacked multiple times. At least 20 people died when a car bomb was detonated in December.

Boko Haram's Islamic extremist insurgency killed 10,000 people last year, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations.

Fighting has forced some 157,000 people to seek refuge in Niger, while 40,000 others have gone to Cameroon and 17,000 are in Chad, according to the United Nations.

Yesterday, the group staged its first attack on Chadian territory, bringing the number of neighboring countries roped into what had previously been an internal Nigerian conflict to three.

The targeted village, Ngouboua, was already home to nearly 3,300 refugees who had fled Boko Haram-related violence in Nigeria, according to the U.N.

Cameroon and Niger have also been attacked. Along with Benin, they have vowed to contribute to a regional force against Boko Haram that is expected to be launched in the coming weeks, though funding questions remain unsettled. 

The U.N. special representative for West Africa said Friday that Nigeria's military needs to show 'greater resolve' in the widening fight against Boko Haram.
