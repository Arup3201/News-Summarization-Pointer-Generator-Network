Actor Jason Patric arrived in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday for a hearing in a heated custody fight with his former girlfriend who had conceived their son from his sperm donation.

Patric, 47, best known for his starring role in the 1980s film The Lost Boys, has filed an appeal seeking to be recognized as a father of Danielle Schreiber's 4-year-old son, Gus. 

In February 2013, the actor lost a court battle to gain visitation rights with Gus under a California law that grants the mother full custody in the absence of a written agreement establishing parental rights before conception.

He said, she said: Schreiber said Patric offered to help her conceive a child under the express condition that he would have no parental rights, but the 47-year-old actor claims he signed forms promising 'an intent to parent'

Ms Schreiber, 41, a massage therapist and the daughter of a prominent Connecticut lawyer, said her on-again, off-again boyfriend never signed their son's birth certificate.

Moreover, the woman said in a statement to ABC News that Patric offered to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization under the express condition that his sperm donation be kept secret, and that he would have no parental rights or obligations.

A judge in a lower court sided with the mother, striping Patric of visitation rights.

The former teen heartthrob, however, insisted that he has been a father to Gus from the day of his birth.

His lawyers will argue that the actor signed forms at the family planning clinic promising 'an intent to parent.'

Speaking to ABC News this week, Patric said the last time he saw his son was 63 weeks ago – even though he lives only 10 minutes away.

‘I said, “It's OK. I'll see you tomorrow.” I've never seen him again,’ he recalled. 

Mr Patric is seeking full custody of little Gus in a high-profile case that has raised serious questions about the parental rights of sperm donors. 

Last week, Patric scored a minor legal victory when a judge citing the First Amendment declined to grant Schreiber a restraining order in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from using their son's name in an advocacy group he had created called 'Stand Up for Gus,' according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Patric’s public campaign has gained some traction in Hollywood, with A-listers like Mark Wahlberg, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm and Mel Gibson lending their support to the cause.

The 47-year-old actor, who is the grandson of The Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason, has spent the past year going around giving interviews and speaking out about the rights of sperm donors at fundraisers for his foundation.

Last July, Patric sat down with Katie Couric for an interview about his legal battle, telling the TV presenter that Gus was stolen from him because of an outdated legal stature that does not recognize the parental rights of sperm donors in those cases where the mother and father are no longer together.

Patric and Schreiber first met in 2002 when he came to her for a massage and struck up a romance, The New York Times reported. In 2009, the Sleepers star offered his on-again, off-again girlfriend to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization.

Gus’ birth had initially helped the couple rebuild their rocky relationship, but three years later they broke up for good, and soon after the actor says he was abruptly barred from having contact with his son. 

On her part, Schreiber said during an interview on NBC's Today Show last July that Patric doesn't deserve any rights to Gus.

'It's not about him having a relationship or contact with Gus. This is just about rights,' she said.

'Me preserving my right to be a sole legal parent, not having to share that with someone who has never intended to and never raised Gus, even when we were dating — Jason never did anything to raise Gus. He never changed a single diaper,' she said.

But Patric - who refers to himself as Gus’ ‘Dada’ online – continues to insists that he has been a real father to the toddler, even taking him to be circumcised when he was eight days old.
