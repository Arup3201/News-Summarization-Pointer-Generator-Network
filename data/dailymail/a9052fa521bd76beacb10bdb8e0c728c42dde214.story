A psychiatric patient accused with slaughtering his hospital room mate pleaded not guilty to the man's murder.

Bart Schafer, 32, allegedly assaulted Robert King, 53, in the room they shared at the County of San Diego Hospital on March 17.

King was found covered in blood at around 2pm by staff at the hospital. As they desperately tried to save him he went into cardiac arrest, suffering from severe head injuries.

Scene: Robert King was allegedly murdered by his room mate at the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital

He was transported to another hospital with bleeding on the brain and facial fractures but died on Sunday from his injuries.

Lt. Kevin Rooney of the San Diego Police Department said: ‘They got him to the trauma center as fast as they could.

‘Shortly after, the psychiatric hospital staff called police and requested officers evaluate Mr. King’s injuries, and we realised that it wasn’t an accident and it was more likely that he had been assaulted.’

At the time Schafer claimed King had fallen and hurt himself, but prosecutors claim he eventually admitted that he had slammed the victim's face into the
ground.

Schafer was arrested and charged with attempt murder and assault with a deadly weapon. When King died his charge was upgraded to murder.

Room mates: King and Schafer shared a room but it is likely they did not each other well

Rooney said the two patients were roommates, but likely did not know each other well - the average time a patient stays in the hospital is two weeks. 

When patients are admitted to a psychiatric hospital, they go through a careful assessment to determine whether they are at risk of hurting themselves or others. 

Deputy District Attorney Makenzie Harvey said the defendant had been 
committed to the psychiatric hospital because of a recent arrest and had
been the victim's roommate for only a short time.

Schafer faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. His bail, initially arraigned last week on an attempted murder charge, was increased Monday from $250,000 to $750,000 after King died from his injuries.

He will be back in court April 4 for a status conference and April 18 for a preliminary hearing.
