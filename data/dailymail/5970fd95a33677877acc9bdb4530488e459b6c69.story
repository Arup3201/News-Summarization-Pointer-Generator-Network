Missing: Teresa Cowley is feared dead as police fear she went overboard on a cruise

A British mother of twin girls was feared dead today after she fell overboard following a night drinking on board a ferry with her husband.

Teresa Cowley, 43, disappeared while she and her partner Mark, also 43, sailed from Hull to Rotterdam in the early hours of Friday morning.

The couple, from Mickleover, Derby, had set off on board the P&O ferry at 8.30pm on Thursday and were due to arrive in the Netherlands at 8.15am the next morning.

They spent the evening in the Pride of Rotterdam's bar and returned to their cabin just before 1am but their key did not work in the lock.

Police say Mark went to reception to get a new key while his wife waited outside the cabin, but when he returned Teresa had vanished and he raised the alarm.

CCTV cameras on board the ship show Teresa staggering alone on deck shortly after 1am on Friday and she has not been seen since.

A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police said: 'The door key to the cabin did not work and while Mr Cowley went to reception to resolve the problem he left Teresa sitting outside the cabin.

'CCTV and witness accounts show Mrs Cowley go alone to Deck 11 Sun Lounge on the ship shortly after 1am on Friday, December 28. She did not return.

'Searches of the ship failed to locate Mrs Cowley who has since been reported missing.

'It is not looking good considering she is lost at sea.'

Teresa - who reportedly has two teenage daughters from a previous relationship - is white, of medium build, around 5ft 4in tall, with black bobbed hair with red highlights.

She was last seen wearing a grey jumper, black leggings and black boots.

She has several distinctive tattoos including the words ‘Mrs Cowley’ written on her forearm, a black panther on one of her ankles and a large tattoo on the right side of her body made up of a dozen roses joined together.

She had no money or identification with her when she went missing.

Detectives from the Harbour Police at Rotterdam are currently investigating.

It is not thought that anyone else is involved or any criminal offence had taken place.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'It's heart-breaking. She was a mum of two teenage girls from a previous relationship. There is still some slim hope she may be found alive.'

Night out: Mr and Mrs Cowley had been drinking in the bar of the Pride incident

Meanwhile the body of a different woman was today pulled from the water near a British ferry terminal.

Police were called at 1.04pm after the crew of a Red Funnel ferry spotted a body floating near a pontoon at Town Quay, in Southampton, Hampshire.

She was hauled onto a police launch boat and taken to Southampton General Hospital, where she will be searched for identification.

Detectives are waiting for the result of a post mortem examination but have said they are not treating the death as suspicious.

A
 spokesman said: 'We believe we know who the deceased was but her family
 have yet to be notified and formal identification hasn't yet taken 
place.'

Witness Simon Dale 
was watching the scene unfold before he caught the ferry to Hythe and 
saw crewmen from the Red Jet ferry trying to hook the body out of the 
water.

He said: 'I was sat around the terminal when the fire alarm went off. We were outside and that's when I saw the Red Jet lads.

'There
 were about 15 of us taking a look at what was happening. But then the 
police came over and asked us to move on saying it wasn't the prettiest 
sight.'
