Cutting the number of bobbies on the beat will leave Britain more at risk of al-Qaeda-inspired attacks, the UK's most experience counter-terror detective has warned.

Peter Clarke, the former terror investigations chief, said police officers on the street were crucial for gathering intelligence on extremists.

The warning comes amid claims up to 34,000 police jobs could be axed after the election as a result of continuing spending cuts proposed by all three major parties.

Peter Clarke, a former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has warned that police officers on the street are crucial for gathering intelligence on extremists.

Mr Clarke said neighbourhood patrols were crucial for gathering information on terror suspects and cutting them will weaken Britain's fight against fanatics.

He said ending such patrols would 'increase the risk the public face from terrorism'.

The former counter terror chief, writing in the Times, said: 'Neighbourhood police hold one end of the 'golden thread' that can take us from the streets of Britain to wherever in the world terrorists are trained, equipped and radicalised.

'Chief constables and police and crime commissioners have tough choices ahead of them in deciding what to cut. Cutting the counter-terrorist policing thread could be fraught with danger.'

The police are in negotiations with the Home Office over increasing the number of counter-terrorism officers while discussions are also being held about how to raise the number of firearms officers.

Policing has had 20 per cent budget cuts since 2010 with a loss of some 34,000 officers and staff and the Home Office grant is being cut by a further £299 million for 2015-16.

Mr Clarke's warning comes amid claims that police have been told to remove their names from the electoral register.

Intelligence chiefs are worried that Islamist fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in France earlier this month that cost 17 lives. Four Jewish people and three police officers were among the dead.

Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge.

The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.

The guidance to Met officers was reported by The Sunday Times, which also claimed that an additional 800 counter-terrorism police could be deployed on Britain's streets.

In addition, the newspaper said Scotland Yard was in talks with the Home Office about extra funding to fight the increased threat to Britain.

The Met would not comment on whether police had been told to remove their names from the electoral register when contacted by MailOnline tonight.

However, a spokesman said earlier today: 'We do not discuss the details of our security response.

'But actions taken already include security advice to officers and staff; measures around police buildings; changing risk assessments that affect how we deploy to certain incidents; (and) bolstering levels of specialist support, including firearms officers.

'The MPS has not decided to implement a blanket response regarding levels of crewing and patrolling in response to concerns about the risk of an attack on officers.'
