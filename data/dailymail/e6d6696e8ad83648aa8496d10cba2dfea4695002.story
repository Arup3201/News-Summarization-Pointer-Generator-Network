Dr Niaz Ahmed has been convicted of sexually assaulting two of his colleagues at South Tyneside Hospital and has been told he may be jailed 

An anaesthetist who was branded 'the octopus' for his wandering hands and lewd comments could be jailed for groping nurses at the hospital where he worked. 

Dr Niaz Ahmed passed off his behaviour as innocent banter and was referred to as a 'sex pest' by prosecutors at Newcastle Crown Court. 

The skilled doctor, who had received numerous warnings from hospital bosses to tone down his behaviour, was convicted of sexually assaulting two of his colleagues more than a decade ago and must now sign the sex offenders register. 

Ahmed, who was suspended from medical practice at a tribunal earlier this year for groping a nurse who was treating him after an accident in 2010, was cleared of three similar charges. 

Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'Imagine what it was like going to work with a sex pest, always the octopus, hands all over the place, underlined by innuendo.'

Mr Hodson said one nurse victim was targeted in the scrub room at the hospital, where Ahmed squeezed her bottom and asked her 'do you fancy it'.

Another had her breasts prodded by the medic while she was at work and said he had told her 'put them away'.

The 55-year-old doctor had previously told bosses at South Tyneside Hospital that his behaviour was in keeping with 'the culture' at the hospital. 

The court heard during a meeting with hospital bosses in 2000 Ahmed accepted it was inappropriate to touch nurses and said any offence caused by him was entirely innocent and accidental. 

During a later meeting with management he said his behaviour continued to be innocent. 

Ahmed, of Cleadon, had claimed he was the victim of a 'witch hunt' in 2012 after he was cleared of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a fireworks display in South Shields in 2011.

The youngsters claimed Ahmed had groped them after boasting about the size of his manhood and complaining about his sex life with his wife.

Bradford Crown Court heard Ahmed was branded 'the octopus' because of his lewd behaviour and comments

He had reportedly said he was 'looking for women the day after he got married.'

He will be sentenced next month and Judge Simon Hickey warned him that 'all options remained open', including a jail sentence. 

Ahmed was bailed until the sentencing hearing.
