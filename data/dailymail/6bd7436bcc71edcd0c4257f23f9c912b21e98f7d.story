The race to get self-driving cars on to public roads is now truly on.

Volvo has announced it aims to put 100 of its autonomous vehicles on roads as soon as 2017.

Members of the public will be put in the driving seats of production-ready cars to test the Drive Me system, which the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’.

Driving change: Volvo aims to put 100 of its self-driving cars on real roads as soon as 2017, putting members of the public in the driving seats of production-ready cars to test a system that the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’

‘We are entering uncharted territory in the field of autonomous driving,’ said Dr Peter Mertens, senior vice president research and development of Volvo Car Group.

‘Taking the exciting step to a public pilot, with the ambition to enable ordinary people to sit behind the wheel in normal traffic on public roads, has never been done before.’

The trial is set to take place on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden and is a collaboration between the auto manufacturer, transport authorities and critically, legislators.

Laws governing the driving of autonomous vehicles has restricted other technology trials.

The trial is set to take place on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden and is a collaboration between the auto manufacturer, transport authorities and critically, legislators. It will use 100 cars fitted with sensors and cameras, which use a cloud-based 3D digital map to guide their journey (illustrated)

It is not clear how much the people involved in the trial will have to take control of their vehicles, but it seems unlikely they will be able to chat on a phone, watch a film, read a book (illustrated) or do some work, for example, as the car motors along. But this is the firm's vision for the future

Sensors: Volvo's Drive Me car is fitted with multiple radars, cameras and laser sensors to plot its exact positioning on the road and give the system a 360° view of the car’s surroundings.

A network of computers processes the information, which together with GPS, generates a real-time map of moving and stationary objects in the environment.

Twelve ultrasonic sensors around the car are used to identify objects close to the vehicle and support autonomous drive at low speeds.

Radars: A wave radar and camera placed on the windscreen reads traffic signs and the road’s curvature and can detect objects on the road such as other road users.

Four radars behind the front and rear bumpers also locate objects.

Two long-range radars on the bumper are used to detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from far behind, which is useful on motorways.

Cameras: Four cameras - two on the wing mirrors, one on the grille and one on the rear bumper - monitor objects in close proximity to the vehicle and lane markings.

A trifocal camera on the windscreen provides a broad 140° view, a 45° view and a long-range, yet narrow, 34° view for improved depth perception and distant-object detection. It’s used to spot suddenly appearing pedestrians and unexpected road hazards.

3D digital map: An HD 3D digital map is used to provide the vehicle with information about the surroundings, such as road curvature, number of lanes, geometry of tunnels and signs etc.

‘High performance GPS’ is matched with the map and the 360° image created by the multitude of sensors, to give the car information about its position in relation to the surroundings.

This means the Drive Me car is able to choose the best course in real time, factoring in variables such as the curvature of the road, speed limit, temporary signs and other traffic.

Volvo's Drive Me cars rely on 28 cameras, sensors and lasers as well as software rules to drive itself on busy roads.

Like other autonomous systems, the system needs a user to select a chosen route so it can use a cloud-based digital map to guide the car's driving, giving it an awareness of known obstacles and features on the road.

The cars use a complex network of sensors, cloud-based positioning systems and intelligent braking and steering technologies.

Dr Mertens said: ‘Autonomous driving will fundamentally change the way we look at driving. In the future, you will be able to choose between autonomous and active driving.

‘This transforms everyday commuting from lost time to quality time, opening up new opportunities for work and pleasure.’

It is not clear how much the people involved in the trial will have to take control of their vehicles, but it seems unlikely they will be able to chat on a phone, watch a film or do some work, for example, as the car motors along. 

This is the aspiration for the future. 

Volvo’s autopilot system is designed to allow the car to take over every aspect of driving in autonomous mode, which the company says is a ‘crucial’ step beyond the automotive systems demonstrated, because it includes fault-tolerant systems.

Dr Erik Coelingh, technical specialist at Volvo Cars, said: ‘It is relatively easy to build and demonstrate a self-driving concept vehicle, but if you want to create an impact in the real world, you have to design and produce a complete system that will be safe, robust and affordable for ordinary customers.’

The main challenge for engineers is building a system that’s robust enough to cope with technical faults that might occur, because a ‘driver’ might not be on the ball enough to respond to a situation immediately, if their attention is focused elsewhere.

Initially, the cars will drive autonomously on selected roads with suitable conditions, for example without oncoming traffic, cyclists and pedestrians.

Mr Coelingh said: ‘Making this complex system 99 per cent reliable is not good enough. You need to get much closer to 100 per cent before you can let self-driving cars mix with other road users in real-life traffic.

‘Here, we have a similar approach to that of the aircraft industry. Our fail-operational architecture includes backup systems that will ensure that Autopilot will continue to function safely also if an element of the system were to become disabled.’

Volvo says that its autopilot systems can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’ such as heavy traffic and emergency situations which require quick, hard braking.

Mr Coelingh said: ‘Just as good drivers would, potentially critical situations are approached with sensible caution. In a real emergency, however, the car reacts faster than most humans.’

The system, however, isn’t designed to negotiate exceptional weather conditions or if the end of a route is reached. In such cases, the driver will be prompted to take over.

If the driver doesn't take over in time, the car will bring itself to a safe place to stop.
