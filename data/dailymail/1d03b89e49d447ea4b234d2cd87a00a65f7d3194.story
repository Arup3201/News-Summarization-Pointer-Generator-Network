Persecuted: Sam Callahan had to call in police over his torment and even moved schools

X Factor star Sam Callahan was so badly tormented by bullies at school he was forced to call the police.

The 19-year-old said he was pinned down and kicked in the face by a bully wearing football boots in one brutal attack.

The Essex-born barman, who last night performed in the first of the ITV talent contest’s live shows, said he was targeted because of his dream of becoming a pop star.

And he revealed that the same bullies have recently sent him good luck messages on Facebook after spotting him on the show.

Callahan claimed the persecution at his secondary school grew so bad that he left and moved to the Sylvia Young Theatre School in West London, whose former pupils include Spice Girl Emma Bunton and the late singer Amy Winehouse.

‘I got pretty badly bullied at my first secondary school, so had to leave there and I went to Sylvia Young,’ said Sam.

‘It was both verbal and physical. I got really badly beaten up.

‘I was quite small and had really blond spiked hair and blue eyes, and I think they wanted to knock me down a peg or two.

‘We had to get the police involved once – when I was 12 a 16-year-old held me down while his mate kicked me in the face with his football boots. We called the police but we didn’t press charges.’

Callahan, who impressed the judges with his rendition of James Blunt’s You’re Beautiful in the show’s audition rounds, added: ‘I’ve always wanted to do music and perform, and I stood out.

‘They used to call me gay, but it was as much me fighting back that got me in trouble because I really stuck up for myself.

‘Since I went on the show, quite a few of the bullies have got back  in touch with me, as if nothing  had happened.

‘They sent messages and just acted as if we were old friends and should meet up. I’m a lot older now – I try not to hold grudges.’

Louis Walsh, Callahan’s mentor in the show, believes the trauma of the bullying may have given him a good grounding to cope with the pressures of the music industry.

Louis, 61, said: ‘Whatever Sam went through has obviously paid off for him because he’s one of the hardest working people I know. He’s always on the phone to me.

‘He has such a great work ethic and I know he’s going to go a long way.’ The bookmakers’ favourite  to win this year’s series – Kent  teenager Tamera Foster – has a different experience of bullying.

She was given a police caution for assault after she attacked a 15-year-old last year.
