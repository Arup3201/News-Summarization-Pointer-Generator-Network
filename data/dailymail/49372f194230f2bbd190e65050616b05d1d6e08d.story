Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale has tweeted a picture to reveal his new boots - and they're certainly not for the feint-hearted.

The days of footballers wearing retro black boots appears to be long gone, as Bale shows off his new Adidas F50's created by Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto. 

The boot's design is predominantly animal-based, with numerous colours featured. The left boot is green, whereas blue is the colour of choice on the right side.

Madrid travel to Ludogorets on Wednesday night, looking to keep their 100% win record in this season's Champions League intact. 

Bale scored once as Los Blancos eased past Basle 5-1 in their previous match, and the Welshman will be hoping his new garish boots can inspire more goals. 

Madrid's start to their La Liga campaign has been far from perfect though, with two losses in their first six matches.
