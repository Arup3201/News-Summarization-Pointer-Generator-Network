A leading surgeon faces being struck off after he conned a wealthy widow out of hundreds of thousands of pounds by persuading her to 'invest' money into joint bank accounts and funding his children's school fees.

Dr Ashraf Elnazir, a leading colonic specialist based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, befriended Gabriella Adler-Jensen after her husband Harry died, leaving her a £1.4m estate.

The father-of-three persuaded her to buy property, land and 'invest' money in joint bank accounts between 2003 and 2006, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard.

Dr Elnazira also suggested she transfer large sums of cash into foreign bank accounts then misappropriated the funds for his own gain.

Mrs Adler-Jensen's financial position diminished 'in direct proportion' to the doctor's own wealth increasing, the hearing was told.

She paid for him to go on a £5,000 holiday to Dubai in 2003, during which the pair developed a sexual relationship, the panel heard.

He also used funds to pay airlines, his racquet club, dentist's bills, his children's school fees and to buy cars.

The panel found his actions were dishonest and likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute and he could now be forced out of the profession.

'The panel is satisfied that you dishonesty misappropriated Mr's A's money and property,' said panel chair Sandra Sturdy.

The leading colonic specialist, based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, denies the allegations and said they never had a close relationship

'The panel is also satisfied that you utilised Mrs A's financial resources for your own benefit and to the detriment of Mrs A.

'It considered that your actions were dishonest and, as such, in breach of a fundamental tenet of the medical profession.

'That being so, your actions had the very real potential to bring the medical profession into disrepute.'

Dr Elnazir became close to the widow after the death of her 84-year-old husband in 2001.

They were living in the same exclusive apartment block in Kensington when the grieving widow, who was herself in ill health, turned to the medic for guidance.

The friendship blossomed and by the end of 2002 the pair regularly socialised and dined out together.

After the decision yesterday Ed Morgan, for the GMC told the panel:  'The doctor was fully aware that Mrs A invested in him that degree of trust and was seeking his assistance to identify both security and safety.

'One symptom of the pattern of behaviour the doctor cultivated was repeatedly and consistently choosing his own interests and aspirations and relegating those of Mrs A,' he added.

'The pair opened a joint HSBC account for 
'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around 
£779,000 between 2003 and 2006' 

'The doctor utilised funds and financial resources as his own, not seeking or gaining her consent for their use.'

Mr Morgan continued: 'He caused Mrs A to incur significant cost in time, effort and emotional commitment simply to lay claim to that which she was entitled.'

Dr Elnazir denied all the allegations against him and, giving evidence, told the panel he never had a close relationship with Mrs Adler-Jensen.

'According to the doctor he was the person who was abused. He classified the whole relationship as bizarre.

'He sought to persuade you that Mrs A was a colleague, that she was a business associate, that he didn't at any time consider her financial security and he didn't think there was any responsibility on him to protect Mrs A from herself,' said Mr Morgan.

'Having seen the opportunity the doctor lost no time in seeking to cultivate it and thereafter harvested the opportunities Mrs A represented under the guise of a close relationship.'

In January 2003 Dr Elnazir persuaded Mrs Adler-Jensen to buy his flat in an exclusive block in West Kensington for £429,000, though it was only valued at £375,000.

Despite her transferring sums of £134,000 £80,000 and £215,000 for the purchase of the property between February and September, Dr Elnazir retained joint ownership.

He later claimed the sums were transferred as gifts for his children or that he considered them as a loan.

When she transferred the sum of £215,000 he said he was 'beside himself and horrified' and thought the behaviour was 'bizarre'.

But he used the funds to put towards the purchase of a new family home in Chiswick, London.

Later that year the pair opened a joint HSBC account for 'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around £779,000 between 2003 and 2006.

The panel found Dr Elnazir withdrew around £70k for his personal use.

Dr Elnazir and Mrs Adler-Jernsen also opened a joint US dollar account for currency trading in 2004 and the widow transferred large sums of money to foreign accounts on the doctor's request.

She transferred a total of $645,645 including a sum of $440k to buy land in Egypt, which was never bought.

On one occasion he told her his brother was in 'serious' financial trouble and asked her to transfer $20,000 because the Egyptian mafia would be 'after' him if the money was not paid.

When Mrs Adler-Jensen sought recompense, first at the high court before reporting the medic to the GMC, Dr Elnazir branded her as 'the enemy', the hearing was told.

'Mrs A became the enemy and as the enemy he was able to concoct lies and further statements to her which were dishonest,' said Mr Morgan.

'We say the conduct was sustained, it was deliberate and it was targeted. There has been no expression of regret, nor any apology.

'Even now the doctor closes his eyes to his actions and the consequences that have befallen Mrs A as a result of them,' he added.

'You have found the doctor has been guilty of material acts of dishonesty. Those acts of themselves and collectively are a course of conduct that represents a significant and fundamental departure from good medical practice,' Mr Morgan told the panel.

The panel must now decide if the doctor's actions amount to misconduct and if his fitness to practise is impaired as a result.

If so he could be forced to work under conditions, face suspension or struck off the medical register.

The doctor is not attending this stage of the hearing, which resumed yesterday for the third time after starting last year.

The hearing continues today.
