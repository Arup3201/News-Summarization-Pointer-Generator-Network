A small law firm in Ealing and the owner of a Wimbledon Chinese restaurant have been caught up in Birmingham owner Carson Yeung’s £55million money-laundering activities.

The transcripts from convicted Yeung’s Hong Kong court case reveal he amazingly deposited $36.4m with Prince Evans solicitors, who operate from an office on Uxbridge Road, Ealing, West London, and are best known locally for social housing, residential and commercial  conveyance business.

The millions transferred to Prince Evans was the subject of conflicting claims during Yeung’s  trial. Yeung’s financial advisor said it was to acquire Birmingham City while Carson claimed it was for a London property. Later it was stated in court the cash deposit had been made on behalf of alleged triad gang leader, Cheung Chi Tai.

It is understood that Yeung was introduced to the Ealing solicitors by his friend Marco Yu, an unlicensed football agent who had used their services while conducting small-scale transfer business. Yu twice failed to pass football agents exams set in Hong Kong, and runs the Bayee Village restaurant in Wimbledon frequented by football figures including Roberto Di Matteo.

Anthony Best, one of Prince Evans’ five partners, would not comment on Thursday and said none of his colleagues would either.

England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke is expected to protest about the Press Association news service ditching their freelance reporters and instead compiling county match reports — which are sold to media outlets — in their office using information on Twitter and websites.

England Basketball are laying off 12 development officers, who had delivered hundreds of competitions to schools and communities, due to drastic cuts in Sport England funding. These were on top of basketball’s entire elite monies being withdrawn by UK Sport, who on appeal gave the sport a one-year reprieve.

The way basketball is being marginalised has led to at least one chief of a well-funded sport to  start challenging UK Sport’s ‘no compromise’ approach of only giving financial backing for Olympic podium potential. Any change of strategy would have to wait for the Tokyo 2020 cycle.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship showed its growing popularity when its O2 show on Saturday sold out in four hours, with front-row seats reserved for a sizeable Arsenal contingent of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs, Nicklas Bendtner, Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, Jack Wilshere, Mesut Ozil and Carl Jenkinson.

The UFC also has strong links with Manchester City whose Abu Dhabi owners have a 20 per cent stake in the booming sport and helped install their former CEO Garry Cook as UFC boss in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Dyke in ‘radical’ claim

FA chairman Greg Dyke produced a tin hat while making his speech at a Wembley function before the Denmark game to highlight his torrid time since taking the helm in July. Yet Dyke promised there would be ‘radical proposals’ in his England Commission report, if he’s allowed to implement them.

Meanwhile, the FA have certainly worked hard on bringing Mayor of Manaus Arthur Virgilio on side after his upset over Roy Hodgson saying the city was the place for England to avoid because of the heat.

Virgilio has since received letters from the FA saying how much they are looking forward to their visit, an FA delegation including Hodgson travelled to Manaus last month to continue the charm offensive and the Mayor was guest of honour at Wembley this week.

Negotiations over setting up the new European rugby club tournament now boil down to how many group games involving English clubs BT Sport, who have a binding contract with Premiership rugby over Europe, are prepared to cede to arch-rivals Sky.

Manchester United manager David Moyes didn’t want any media spotlight on the club’s training camp in Dubai over the last week to the extent that even the in-house MUTV had a request to go on the trip turned down.
