It took three years to build, cost more than $77m and 28 workmen lost their lives during its construction, but when it was finally completed in 1936, three years after work first began, Oakland Bay Bridge was the largest in the world, spanning some 
7,180metres making it nearly 4.5 miles long.

And these spectacular pictures charting the dramatic rise of the monolithic construction have gone on display for what is believed to be the first time since they were taken all those years ago.

The images were were captured by a plucky young wannabe photographer who went by the name of Peter Stackpole.

Nervous: Stackpole was just 21 when he took the ferry to San Francisco, where workmen gathered before being taken across the bay for their day's work

Nerves of steel: In 1934 Peter Stackpole made climbed to the top of Bay Bridge. It was the first of many trips the 21-year-old photographer was to make by the time the structure was completed two years later

In 1934 Stackpole, 21, took the ferry
 from his Oakland home across to the San Francisco side where workers 
were gathering before heading out to work on the Bridge.

A man with a hammer in his hand decided to test the nerve of the young man who had a camera in his hand.

He goaded Stackpole, saying: 'Hey kid, why don't you come out with us? You'll get some good pictures.'

Not one to pass up on an opportunity 
like that, Stackpole jumped on board and rode out to the first tower, 
which was under construction.

Work in progress: When Stackpole took this picture there was still some way to go before the two sides of San Francisco Bay were joined

Up he went, scampering and shimmying 
along the cables and catwalks, as high as any worker was willing to take
 him, then a little higher in order to get a picture of him.

By the time he came back down it 
was 1936, the bridge was completed, and he had a body of work that would
 outlast anything else he would do.

That was no mean feat. During his career, Stackpole, one of Life Magazine's first staff photographers, was to shoot no fewer than 26 covers for the iconic publication, including sessions with 
Hollywood stars.

He died in 1997 aged 83.

When 'Peter Stackpole: Bridging the Bay'
 opens Saturday at the Oakland Museum of California, it will mark the 
first time the museum's full set of his bridge pictures has been shown 
since the photos were acquired, and that took 20 years to gather 20 
images for the collection.

Men only: 8,300 workers came together to build the bridge, all of whom were men. Right, Bay Bridge had the deepest piers in the world. There was even a rumour a man had been buried in the centre one, but it turned out to be a prank

Backdrop: Two businessmen discuss the big news of the day, while a man and a young boy look out across the bay

Massive undertaking: It took three years to complete the bridge and 28 men lost their lives in its construction

Stackpole later said the pictures he took, many from dizzying heights high above San Francisco Bay, were his finest
