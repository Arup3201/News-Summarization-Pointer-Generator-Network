Travis claims he is the victim of a 'witchhunt' and that he was 'mad as hell about the allegations'

Dave Lee Travis told a court yesterday he had been groped by three famous women – but refused to divulge their names.

The former BBC Radio 1 DJ said they ‘put their hands down my legs and squeezed me’.

Travis told Southwark Crown Court it was a ‘different world’ back in the 1970s, when some of his alleged sex offences are said to have taken place.

He said ‘things that happened ... was just flirtatious behaviour’.

The 68-year-old also claimed that half of the country would be in jail by now ‘if patting somebody’s bottom in the 1970s was a crime’.

Back then, ‘you could put your arm around someone’s waist and it wasn’t misread as an attack’ and ‘you could touch someone on their shoulder and you wouldn’t get arrested for it’.

The DJ told the court: ‘Put any person on the stand and ask them about those days and they will say it was flirtatious.

I could give you names of four women, three of whom are very famous, who have groped me – and I mean groped me.

‘I don’t mean touch my back or bottom, but they have put their hands down my legs and squeezed me.

‘Do you want their names? I’m not going to give them to you. But it happened.’

The former BBC presenter, known as DLT, 
denies indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another.

The DJ did concede he was ‘no angel’ when questioned about ‘falling into temptation’.

During heated cross-examination on his third day in the witness box, he said the allegations against him were simply part of a ‘witch hunt’ which made him ‘as mad as hell’.

Wearing a dark suit and lilac shirt, he became visibly agitated when cross examined by the QC, who suggested he was ‘a liar’.

‘Oh my god!’ He exclaimed. ‘I 
understand it’s your job to belittle me and tell the jury what a 
terrible person I am, but I will not stand for that.’

The former presenter insisted he had ‘nothing to apologise for’ and had done ‘nothing to warrant his trial’.

‘I have no idea why they (the alleged victims) came forward now’, he added.

He
 said some of the women were mistaken but maintained at least one - a 
girl who claims she was attacked at Radio 1 studios in 1976 - has 
‘positively lied’.

‘I have 
no concept of why a woman would suddenly come forward after all these 
years and is very deeply hurt by something which definition, even if it 
had happened - I think one woman said it was a joke or something.

‘I just don’t understand this.’

Prosecutor
 Miranda Moore QC asked: ‘Were you mad as hell because you were doing 
this sort of thing for years and years, thinking that it was perfectly 
all right, when it fact it wasn’t?’

Travis replied: ‘No, that is absolutely 100 per cent wrong.’

Ms Moore asked him: ‘Why are you 
finding it so incredulous these women are coming forward to give 
evidence for example, about you squeezing their bottom?’

‘I’m incredulous because it didn’t happen’, the DJ replied.

In
 a rare light-hearted moment, the DJ said he was insulted not to be 
considered a sex symbol in his heyday, claiming he was ‘fair to 
middling’.

But he conceded: ‘I never said I was a sex symbol. I’m a big cuddly hairy bear.’

Video
 footage of him attending the launch of a hospital radio station with 
his wife Marianne in Hertfordshire in 1973 was played to the court.

Travis is accused of molesting a 17-year-old carnival princess as he walked around the hospital wards.

The footage shows him posing for pictures with his arms around two carnival princesses.

Travis allegedly touched the young woman’s breasts and groped her thighs when they were alone in a darkened corridor.

She tearfully told how she had 
suffered ‘40 years of hell’ at the hands of the Radio 1 DJ, adding her 
sex life with her late husband had been destroyed.

But
 he suggested that he was ‘too important’ and would not have been left 
alone at any time, adding that the woman could be a ‘fantasist’.

He then holds the one he is accused of molesting in his arms and appears to say ‘I’ve pulled’. Travis claimed he said ‘mad fool’.

He said if he wanted to act inappropriately, he would have ‘left his wife in the car’, jurors heard.

Asked if he had indecently assaulted her, the DJ said the allegation was ‘complete nonsense’.

When asked by his counsel, Stephen Vullo,
 for his version of events, DLT said: ‘All I can say is, no, it didn’t 
happen, I was never alone with this woman, people were there from start 
to finish and my wife was there, for God’s sake.

'It just didn’t happen.’

Responding to a question by
 Ms Moore about why didn’t he simply shake the girl’s hand, he said: 
‘I’m not an accountant, it’s meant to be a fun business, it’s meant to 
be show business.’

Asked if his wife would give evidence about the hospital radio incident he said ‘Not if I can help it’

‘She has suffered enough without having to go through all this melee.’

Travis allegedly molested 10 women and a 15-year-old girl between 1976 and 2008.

The
 DJ, known to the court by his real name, David Patrick Griffin, denies 
13 charges of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.

Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. The trial continues.
