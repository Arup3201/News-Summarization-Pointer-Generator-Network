Biased media coverage helped Turkey's prime minister romp home in the country's first direct presidential election, international observers have warned.

Unofficial results show Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, won the presidency outright yesterday with nearly 52 per cent of the vote.

But monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said today Erdogan's 'use of his official position, along with biased media coverage, gave him a distinct advantage over the other candidates.'

Erdogan's campaign dominated the media coverage, according to the Associated Press.

Unofficial vote tallies by the Turkish media showed Erdogan won about 51.9 percent in Sunday's election, with his main challenger Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu following with 38.3 percent.

Selahattin Demirtas, a young Kurdish politician running on a left-wing platform, was in third place with 9.7 percent.

The election commission was expected to issue official vote figures later today.

A three-term prime minister who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, Erdogan has been a divisive figure. 

Revered by many as a champion of the people who has steered Turkey to years of economic prosperity, he has been criticised by others for an allegedly autocratic style of governance that critics say has tried to impose his religious and conservative mores on a nation built on secularism.

Moreover, Erdogan has now vowed to transform the presidency from a largely ceremonial post into a powerful position.

He has said he will activate the post's rarely used dormant powers - a legacy of a 1980 coup - including the ability to call parliament and summon Cabinet meetings.

'Erdogan got what he wanted,' Murat Yetkin, Editor-in-Chief of the Hurriyet Daily News, wrote in an editorial Monday.

'He wanted to consolidate all the executive power in his hands and now he has the chance and capacity for that.'

In his victory speech Sunday night, Erdogan struck a conciliatory tone toward critics who fear he is bent on a power grab as he embarks on another five years at the country's helm.

'Today is a milestone for Turkey. Today is the day Turkey is born from its ashes and a new Turkey is built,' he told thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters from the balcony of his party headquarters in the capital, Ankara.

'I will not be the president of only those who voted for me. I will be the president of 77 million,' he vowed.

Not everyone was convinced.

'For me, he is not my president. I'm the people but he is not my president. First of all, the elections period wasn't fair,' said Sener Gunduz, a surveyor in Istanbul.

International election monitors who visited a limited number of polling stations said Sunday's vote was 'generally organised in a professional and efficient manner.' But they said unbalanced media coverage prior to the vote strongly favored Erdogan.

Erdogan's dominance in media coverage ahead of the election 'almost certainly was to his benefit when voters entered polling booths,' said Vilija Aleknaite Abramkiene, coordinator for the monitors from the OSCE.

But she added that the vote showed 'there is a vibrant political life in Turkey' and the results showed 'the potential for a healthy balance in political forces.'
