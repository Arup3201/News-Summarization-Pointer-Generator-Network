The president and first lady were in fine form during Sunday night’s Kennedy Center Honors, laughing and holding hands at the event, which recognize the nation’s most culturally influential artists, performers, actors, and musicians.

Wearing a stunning Michael Kors gold lamé dress embellished at the neckline, the first lady dazzled as she entered the East Room of the White House with her husband, who was wearing a smartly-tailored tuxedo and an American flag on his lapel.

Mr Obama honored seven of the country’s most influential artists, including Dustin Hoffman, Chicago bluesman Buddy Guy, late night host David Letterman, ballerina Natalia Markarova, and surviving members of rock band Led Zeppelin.

The festivities later transitioned to the Kennedy Center, where fellow performers put on a show which will be broadcast later this month.

Stars from New York, Hollywood and 
the music world gathered Sunday in Washington to salute the honorees who
were tonight receiving the nation’s highest award for artistically 
influential Americans.

‘Tonight, we continue a tradition 
here at the White House by honoring some extraordinary people who have 
no business being on the same stage together,’ the president began, 
joking to the recipients.

He hailed the drive and vision of the
honorees, noting that many, like blues musician Buddy Guy, grew up in 
conditions that didn’t foster creativity. Guy, for instance, was born 
into a family of Louisiana sharecroppers with no electricity or running 
water.

He went on to pioneer the use of distortion and feedback with his electric guitar.

‘(Their) passion took each of them 
from humble beginnings to the pinnacle of their profession,’ Mr Obama 
said, according to The Hill.

‘Tonight in the People’s House, we have a chance to say thank you.’

Former president Bill Clinton also offered lavish praise to Guy.

'Buddy Guy's life is a miracle,' 
Clinton said. 'Just imagine you want to be a guitar player and you get 
your first strings by tearing off the screen door. ... He came from that
to this.'

Late-night host David Letterman was one of the seven honored in the annual awards ceremony. 
Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel joined in celebrating Letterman's influence on many other comedians.

'I knew Johnny, and I loved Johnny. 
Johnny was beyond reproach,' Colbert said in a toast to Letterman. 'Dave
was stupid. Dave was ours. Dave was like us.

'We wanted to throw things off of 
buildings. ... We would love to stick our heads out the window of 30 
Rock and yell at passers-by, `I'm not wearing any pants!''

Colbert marveled at Letterman receiving such an award after he 'corrupted the minds of a generation.'

Paul Shaffer, Letterman's longtime 
band leader, said he knew his boss was uncomfortable hearing such 
accolades, but that he knew Letterman was enjoying every second of it.

Meryl Streep introduced the honorees 
Saturday during a formal dinner at the U.S. State Department and noted 
that Letterman had surpassed his mentor, Johnny Carson, in sustaining 
the longest late-night television career for more than 30 years.

To salute Led Zeppelin, big names 
from the rock world dressed in black tie for their music heroes as a 
string ensemble played the band's hit song 'Kashmir' and other tunes at 
the State Department.

Michelle Obama favored an intricate Michael Kors gold lamé dress embellished at the neckline, from the American designer's 2013 resort collection.

She accessorized with an elegant updo and gold earrings.

This is the second time in two weeks the first lady has worn a gold ensemble by Kors, wearing a gold Michael Kors suit to the unveiling of the gingerbread White House.

Kors described his collection as being of 'opulent minimalism,' inspired by a recent trip to Istanbul.

Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl said 
he never took any music lessons when he was starting out because 'my 
teachers were Led Zeppelin. ... They were the most powerful thing in my 
life.'

Lenny Kravitz said their influential music, at its zenith in the 1970s, became a lasting part of the culture of rock and roll.

'It's very difficult,' he said. 'You 
get four guys that come together and make something so much more 
powerful than they all are.'

Zeppelin front man Robert Plant said 
he was flattered and overwhelmed in receiving the American culture 
prize. He said he was glad to see his former band mates, John Paul Jones
and Jimmy Page, using good table manners.

The trio is scheduled to appear 
Monday on CBS' 'Late Show with David Letterman.' They are often asked if
they'll reunite. Plant told The Associated Press he plans to continue 
traveling the world and wants to make new music along the way.

'If anybody wants to write some new songs, I'm game to write songs,' he said.

Hoffman was honored for charting his 
own path after taking a junior college class in acting that 'nobody ever
flunks.' Streep, a 2011 honoree, said Hoffman's quest to become an 
actor required waiting tables and typing for the yellow pages by day.

'He'd do anything if it meant at night he could find himself on the stage,' she said.

Glenn Close toasted Hoffman for 
defining the character actor as leading man in such movies as 'The 
Graduate,' 'Rain Man' and 'Tootsie' - and as an artist who insisted on 
setting the highest standards for himself.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 
Clinton said the ballerina Makarova 'risked everything to have the 
freedom to dance the way she wanted to dance' when she defected from the
Soviet Union in 1970.

Makarova quickly made her debut with 
the American Ballet Theatre and later was the first exiled artist to 
return to the Soviet Union before its fall to dance with the Kirov 
Ballet.

Clinton also took special note of 
Letterman, saying he must be wondering what he's doing in a crowd of 
talented artists and musicians.

'Dave and I have a history,' she 
said. 'I have been a guest on his show several times, and if you include
references to my pant suits, I'm on at least once a week.'

The crowd of artists and entertainers
gave Clinton a standing ovation as she hosted her final salute to the 
nation's artists as secretary of State.

Kennedy Center Chairman David 
Rubenstein gave her a subtle nudge to run for president in 2016, saying 
there's another room at the State Department to name after a secretary 
who later becomes president.
