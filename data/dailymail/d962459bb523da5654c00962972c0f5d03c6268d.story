A guidebook has apologised to a seaside town for calling it 'brash' and 'full of kiss-me-quick hats'.

The AA Guide to Cornwall also said Looe in east Cornwall was a place where 'you won't find the traditional Cornish thatched cottages or peaceful walks'.

Local traders are furious and have threatened to withdraw membership of the guide.

The AA Guide to Cornwall has angered traders by describing Looe, pictured, as 'brash'

Traders in Looe, on the south east coast of Cornwall, are furious and have threatened to withdraw membership of the AA guide

They described the review as 'not a true view of Looe'.

The AA has now apologised and promised to re-word the review in its next edition.

One holidaymaker from York says the reviewer needed 'a trip to a well known opticians' and another slammed it was a 'very narrow perspective'.

Gill Bridges, whose Polraen County House is advertised through the AA, said: 'Why should I pay a company to advertise when they then rubbish the town I trade in ? I feel like pulling my membership.'

Town crier Roger Bennett offered to take the reviewer on a walk around the town to 'let them see and hear the quality of life in Looe'.

The AA has vowed to work with the author of the review to reword the introduction with the revised version included in the next reprint of the guide

In a statement the AA said: 'Looe is a very popular place with plenty to offer visitors of all ages and we apologise for any offence that may have been caused by the wording used in the introduction.

'The section on Looe does highlight the array of great places to visit, however, with hindsight we agree that the opening could have been worded more sensitively.

'We will work with the author to reword the introduction and this will be included in the next reprint of the guide.'

The review blames railway links for turning Looe into a holiday destination and the French for stopping the 'leisured classes' holidaying on the Continent.

Walk some of the Smugglers' Way: A stunning trail from Boscastle on the north coast of Cornwall to Looe. The 36-mile route takes in Bodmin Moor and passes landmarks like the Jamaica Inn, Dobwalls and Sowden's Bridge.

Visit the Wild Futures Monkey Sanctuary: Situated near the town, the active rescue centre features 37 animals. It is currently home to three different species - Barbary macaques, capuchins and woolly monkeys.

A day out at East Looe Beach: Described by visitcornwall.com as a 'lovely bucket and spade-style beach' it is a long-time favourite with holidaymakers and a prime swimming spot right next to the bustling town.

Crabbing on the harbour walls: Children can often be seen dangling lines off the harbour walls near East Looe Beach while others prefer to watch the world go by on nearby Banjo Pier.

Take a boat trip: Many excursions leave from the town to explore the beautiful coastline and Looe Island, a wildlife sanctuary just off Hannafore Point and there is even a glass bottom boat so tourists can observe marine life.
