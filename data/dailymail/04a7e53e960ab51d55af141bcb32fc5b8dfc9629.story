The North Atlantic Ocean turned into a training ground today as the USS Theodore Roosevelt took part in a military exercise with submarines and guided-missile destroyers.

The Navy said the 1,092 feet aircraft carrier, which is nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall, is 'preparing for future deployments.'

'Yesterday we practiced some more maneuvers but this time with an international twist,' it wrote on its Facebook page.

Theodore Roosevelt participated in the exercise with the Peruvian submarine BAP Islay, the guided-missile destroyers USS Winston Churchill, USS Forrest Sherman, USS Farragut and the guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy.

It can carry 90 fixed wing aircraft and helicopters as it reaches its maximum speed of 30+ knots.

Last month the Navy released a photo of one of the latest tests of the X-47B unmanned combat aircraft on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt.

Earlier this year, the Navy announced that the USS Theodore Roosevelt would replace the USS Ronald Reagan in San Diego in 2015

USS Theodore Roosevelt was launched in 1984 and last year she was redelivered to the Navy after successful sea trials that tested the ship’s systems after its refueling and complex overhaul

The Navy's X-47B flew in the carrier pattern with manned aircraft for the first time and conducted a total of five catapult launches, four arrestments and nine touch-and-go landings, including a night time shipboard flight deck handling evaluation. 

According to the Navy, the operation which took eight days, all went well. 

Earlier this year, the Navy announced that the USS Theodore Roosevelt, nicknamed the Big Stick, would replace the USS Ronald Reagan in San Diego in 2015  allowing the USS Ronald Reagan to move to Yokosuka, Japan and replace the USS George Washington. 

USS Theodore Roosevelt was launched in 1984 and last year she was redelivered to the Navy after successful sea trials that tested the ship’s systems after its refueling and complex overhaul.

The supply ship USNS Kanawha pulled alongside and pumped 600,000 gallons of jet fuel into the carrier. 

The refueling and complex overhaul process happens once during a ship’s 50-year lifetime and involves upgrades to nearly every space and system on the ship. 

The carrier  participated in several wars and operations: The Gulf War in 1991, Operation Allied Force in 1999, Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001/2002 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.
