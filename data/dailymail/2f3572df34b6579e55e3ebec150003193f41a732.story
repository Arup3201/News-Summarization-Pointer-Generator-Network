The Occupy Wall Street movement got nasty again yesterday as scores of protesters were arrested in a dramatic crack down by New York City's police.

Demonstrators were seen being taken down by no-nonsense officers during a protest near the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase bank in Manhattan.

The protesters were directing their anger and frustration at the state of the U.S. economy to JPMorgan Chase's high-profile chief executive Jamie Dimon.

Scuffle: Police arrest marchers from Occupy Wall Street, during a protest near JPMorgan Chase bank headquarters last night in New York

Taken down: A demonstrator with Occupy Wall Street is arrested during a march near the financial district in New York yesterday

Held: Onlookers said police arrested four protesters during a march against Chase in New York on Wednesday

But unfortunately for the 
demonstrators, Mr Dimon is reportedly overseas in Asia. Protesters went 
to his house on Tuesday in Manhattan as they expressed concerns about 
forthcoming tax changes.

They are demanding that New York 
state extends a so-called millionaires tax due to expire at the end of 
the year, saying that more than $400,000 will be back in Mr Dimon's 
pocket if it is allowed to end.

Barricades had been placed outside the JPMorgan Chase building in preparation for the protest on Wednesday, and many police officers stood on duty. Police arrested four people at the bank building.

Organisers said beforehand they 
wanted to tell Mr Dimon that New York needs the extra revenue for 
schools, subways, human services and investments to create more jobs and
 better futures.

Average chief executive pay in the 
U.S. is 142 times that of lower-ranked employees. British bosses
 pull in 69 times more than their workers while Sweden has an average 
gap of only 34 times.

Protesters have camped out in 
Zuccotti Park near Wall Street, rallying against billions of dollars in 
bailouts banks received during the financial crisis, which pushed the 
U.S. economy into recession.

Last night, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke to protesters and warned them that the park will be cleaned on Friday, although the demonstrators will not be evicted.

Demonstrators claim that after the 
taxpayer-funded bailouts, banks recovered quickly to earn huge profits - 
while average Americans suffer high unemployment and job insecurity with
 little help.

About 500 protesters took to 
Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side neighbourhood on Tuesday, marching 
past the homes of Mr Dimon and others such as hedge fund manager John 
Paulson.

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and David Koch, of energy firm Koch Industries, were also targets.

Shouts: Occupy Wall Street protesters march in front of the Chase Manhattan bank headquarters

While Tuesday's march was peaceful, 
hundreds of people have been arrested in previous rallies in New York, 
and police have used pepper spray on protesters.

Demonstrators were arrested in 
Washington, Boston and Chicago on Tuesday at protests inspired by the 
Occupy Wall Street movement.

The arrests signalled a hardening of the
position of both protesters and police as tension rise.

According to Occupy Together, which 
has become an online hub for protest activity, the Occupy Wall Street 
movement has sparked rallies in more than 1,300 cities throughout the 
U.S. and the world.
