The parents of a murdered Auburn University student from suburban Atlanta said they’ve filed an official claim against the school.

Lauren Burk’s family believe she might still be alive if the school had a campus police department.

Burk, 18, a graduate of Walton High School in Marietta, Georgia, was abducted from a campus parking lot and killed in March 2008.

Courtney Lockhart, a 23-year-old Iraq War veteran, was convicted in her murder in 2010 and was sentenced to death.

Terrifying scenario: Burk was snatched from a parking lot on the campus of Auburn University during a robbery attempt

‘It’s like it happened yesterday,’ Jim Burk told the station WSB-TV of his daughter’s death. ‘There’s not a day that goes by that my family doesn’t have her close in our mind and heart.’

‘Losing a child is like carrying stones in your pocket at all times,’ said Lauren’s mother, Viviane Guerschon. ‘You get used to the weight, but the weight is always there.’

Police said Lockhart abducted Burk from a parking lot outside an Auburn dorm during a bungled robbery attempt on the night of March 4, 2008.

He forced her to take off her clothes so she wouldn't try to escape and drove around, investigators said, trying to decide what to do with her.

Lockhart shot Burk in the chest at close range as she jumped from the moving car, police said. She bled to death along the side of the road a short time later.

Phoenix City police arrested Lockhart three days later after a car chase sparked by an attempted robbery.

Burk’s parents said they think the presence of campus police officers could have prevented the parking lot abduction. 

Auburn shuttered its police department several years before the killing to save money. Auburn city police patrol the campus.

Burk’s parents also said they believe Auburn did not follow security recommendations in a federal report.

Auburn cannot be sued because of sovereign immunity laws, WSB-TV reported.

Parents' anguish: Lauren's family believe the presence of campus police officers could have prevented her abduction and murder

The Burk family said it has filed a claim seeking $1million against the school with the state’s Board of Adjustment. The board can consider the claim and use state money to compensate cases that it feels have merit.

‘It’s kind of a moral claim, and I want them to be judged by public opinion,’ Mr Burk said. ‘My concern is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.’

A spokesman for the university said the university doesn’t comment on pending investigations.
