A gang of militant Muslims massacred 29 people at a Chinese railway station after they were unable toÂ  leave the country to wage holy war, it has been claimed.

Chinese state media said militants from Xinjiang, home to a large Muslim Uighur minority, carried out the 'terrorist' attack last Saturday in the southwestern city of Kunming, killing at least 29 people and wounding about 140.

Police shot dead four of the attackers and captured the other four.

Panic: Police are urgently questioning all Uighur Muslims in Kunming after the attack that left 143 injured

CCTV shows there to have been 10 masked attackers randomly knifing bystanders in Kunming station

Distressing photos circulating online 
showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the
 terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, 
premeditated, violent terrorist attack'.

Qin
 Guangrong, Communist Party chief of Yunnan province where Kunming is 
located, said the eight attackers had 'originally wanted to participate 
in jihad'.

'They could not 
leave from Yunnan, so they looked elsewhere, and went to Guangdong 
province, but also could not leave, so they returned to Yunnan,' Qin was
 quoted as saying by the state-controlled Xinhua news agency.

According
 to Qin, the gang then went to Yunnan's Honghe county close to the 
Vietnam border, where they planned to carry out jihad either in Honghe 
or at railway or bus stations in Kunming if they were again unable to 
leave the country.

He said that 'some people' who had been in contact with the eight were also in detention, though he gave no details.

There have been instances in the past of Uighurs who have turned up in Southeast Asia seeking asylum.

Residents, mainly of the Han ethnic majority, have called for the Uighur minority to be driven out of Yunnan

In
 2009, Cambodia deported a group of about 20 Uighurs to China. Cambodia,
 the recipient of increasingly large amounts of Chinese investment and 
trade, was sharply rebuked by human rights groups for deporting them.

Many
 Uighurs say they are unhappy at Chinese restrictions on their culture 
and religion, though the government says they are given widespread 
freedoms.

Beijing says it faces a real threat from militant Islamists in Xinjiang who want an independent state called East Turkestan.

Authorities
 say many have links with foreign groups, though rights groups and some 
foreign experts say there is little evidence to support this.

Qin
 said that lessons needed to be learnt from the attack, which took place
 hundreds of km (miles) from Xinjiang in a subtropical province better 
known for its scenic beauty and largely harmonious relations with ethnic
 minorities.

'(Our) awareness of terrorism was not enough, and we could not have imagined before that terrorism could happen here.'

Police chief and head of the government's central commission for political affairs Meng Jianzhu visited the wounded on Sunday and was given an update by Kunming officers on their investigation
