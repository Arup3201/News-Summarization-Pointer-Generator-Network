A team of intrepid explorers last night slipped into the sea in a whaling boat and began their 800 mile journey from the Antarctic to South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean.

Wearing obsolete clothes and equipment, and trusting their lives to a small lifeboat that could capsize at any moment, the six men have no idea what to expect on their dangerous odyssey.

If it sounds like something that might have happened to legendary explorer Ernest Shackleton, it is.

The six man team, comprised of Britons and Australians, are recreating the incredible journey made almost 100 years ago.

The Shackleton Epic expedition aims to become the first to authentically recreate what is acknowledged as one of history's greatest journeys of survival to honour the legend of Shackleton as the centenary of his expedition approaches.

In 1914 Shackleton's boat, the Endurance, became trapped in the Antarctic ice and was eventually crushed and sank. His attempt to raise the alarm is considered by many to be one of the greatest journeys ever made.

Shackleton took a small party from 
his crew and rowed 800 miles on the lifeboat James Caird from Elephant 
Island to South Georgia, where they knew they could get help from a whaling station.

The British and Australian team, led 
by Australian explorer and environmentalist Tim Jarvis, will row the 
same route and then cross the mountainous, glacial interior of South Georgia to reach the north coast.They will use no equipment that was not available in Shackleton's time.

The Alexandra Shackleton, a 22.5’ whaler that is an exact replica of the James Caird used by Shackleton, has no keel and 
capsizes very easily.

The six British and Australian adventurers on board the boat, named for Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter, set out with the help of unusually moderate winds.

Expedition leader, Tim Jarvis, 46, a well known British/Australian polar adventurer, said that while he and his crew are recreating the expedition as authentically as possible, with similar gear, navigation instruments and boat, he believes he is merely walking in Shackleton’s wake.

Recreation: As well as recreating Shackleton's perilous journey, the team is hoping their expedition will help to 'shine a light' on the changing Antarctic environment

Daring: The explorers intend to sail 800 miles from the Antarctic to South Georgia, to 'honour the legend' of Ernest Shackleton as the centenary of his adventure approaches

'I hope this expedition not only does his memory justice but also reminds us all of how incredibly beautiful, yet fragile, this part of the world is,' the environmental scientist said.

'Hopefully, if we succeed, we’ll be able to shine another light on the changing Antarctic environment.

'I’m doing this expedition to test 
the more resourceful side of myself, to honour the memory of Sir Ernest 
Shackleton by undertaking this most challenging of journeys and to draw attention to the effects of climate change on Antarctica and ultimately, the planet.'

The
patron of Shackleton Epic is appropriately The Hon. Alexandra 
Shackleton, Sir Ernest’s granddaughter, who originally approached Mr 
Jarvis about recreating the journey, sent her good wishes along with those of Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard.

She said: 'As the very proud Patron 
of the Shackleton Epic Expedition I am sending my warmest good wishes to
Tim Jarvis and his five companions as they depart.

'The Expedition
will be incredibly demanding both at sea and on land, but I have every 
confidence that the men will remember my grandfather's words: "Difficulties are just things to overcome".  

'There will be a triumphant conclusion, and a wonderful tribute to Ernest Shackleton and his companions of 1916.'

Australian
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: 'On behalf of our nation – and in 
the warm spirit of Anglo-Australian friendship - I wish you well in the 
challenging days ahead.

'I trust you will recapture some of Shackleton’s ethos as well, and thus return uplifted in spirit and full of renewed admiration for this remarkable man and what he was able to achieve in the name of science and humanity.'

The expedition crew, all 
accomplished sailors or mountaineers, also comprises Nick Bubb, skipper 
(British), Paul Larsen, navigator (Australian),
Barry Gray, mountain leader and expedition cook (British), Seb 
Coulthard, bosun (British) and Ed Wardle, cameraman and mountaineer 
(British).

Jarvis paid tribute to his expedition
crew who have dedicated themselves to the task of preparing for the 
expedition during the past year, and to their supporters and family.

'While
we’ve been careful to plan well to avoid unnecessary risks as 
Shackleton tried to do, clearly there are inherent dangers involved in 
attempting an expedition of this magnitude.

'Shackleton’s journey certainly defied the odds and he and his men returned home safely and we aim to emulate them.

'The crew and I want to express our utmost gratitude to our friends and family, sponsors and supporters as well as the community of adventures and sailors who have assisted with this expedition.'

Depending on weather conditions in the Southern Ocean, it is estimated that the Alexandra Shackleton will reach South Georgia within 16 days, the same time the James Caird took to cross infamous stretch of ocean.

Once there, the crew will climb over South Georgia’s mountainous, crevassed interior hoping to reach the old whaling station at Stromness, before paying their respects to 'The Boss' at Shackleton’s grave at Grytviken.

During the expedition, a 75’ yacht, Australis, will act as the support vessel providing a communications, safety and filming platform for Shackleton Epic

On May 20, 1916, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton had to make a life or death decision.

Twenty-two
men on his trans-Antarctic expedition had been marooned on the edge of 
Antarctica for more than a year after their ship, the Endurance, had 
been crushed by pack ice.

To
get help, Shackleton and four companions had sailed 800 miles across 
the South Atlantic in a tiny open boat, surviving a hurricane.

Three
of them then trekked across mountains and made the hazardous descent 
down a glacier in the belief that it would lead them to a whaling 
station.

But now they had discovered that the path was blocked by impassable cliffs.

They had been on their feet for 24 hours, they were frozen and near to despair but they had to retrace their steps.

As Shackleton pondered their next move, his two companions pleaded to be allowed to sleep.

Shackleton agreed but woke them five minutes later, told them they had been asleep for half-an-hour, and insisted they carry on.

The next afternoon they reached the whaling station. And three months later, a ship reached the trapped men.

Later,
Shackleton admitted that he too had been tempted to lie down and sleep,
perhaps never to wake again. 'To die without any pain was an ideal of 
death,' he wrote, invoking Keats.

'But
if you're a leader, a fellow that others look to, you've got to keep 
going. That was the thought that sailed us through the hurricane and 
tugged us up and down those mountains.'

Since
those days, Shackleton has come to represent all the finest values a 
leader can exhibit: courage, determination, patience, loyalty and an 
absolute commitment to the welfare of his men.
