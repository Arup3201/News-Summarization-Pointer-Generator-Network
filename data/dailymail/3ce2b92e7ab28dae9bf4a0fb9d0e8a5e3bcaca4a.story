British holidaymakers are planning more city breaks than beach holidays in 2015 as tourists trade sun for sights, new research has revealed.

City breaks trumped beach getaways in 2014 and are expected to narrowly hold the top spot next year, according to a travel trends report published by British travel association Abta.

The organisation’s research found that 43 per cent of people are planning a city break while 42 per cent are planning a beach holiday.

Another trend is holidaymakers’ desire to live like a local in search of ‘more authentic’ experiences.

Many holiday companies are now offering people the chance to enjoy hidden gems alongside traditional tourist attractions.

The report also listed 12 destinations that are expected to emerge in 2015.

Austria is at the top of the list, followed by Botswana, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Japan.

Abta said British holidaymakers have been playing it safe in recent years, but next year more than a third (35 per cent) think they will travel to a country they have never visited before.

The report, produced in association with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, also found that the ‘destination celebration’ is growing in popularity as more groups travel abroad for weddings, anniversaries and stag and hen trips.

Abta said consumer confidence is slowly returning to the holiday market with more consumers planning to spend more on their holidays in 2015 than those looking to cut back.

According to a survey of 2,001 Britons, 20 per cent of respondents said they would spend more on trips next year compared to 15 per cent who will spend less.

Abta said the growth is being led by more affluent holidaymakers who are taking more holidays, package trips and a desire to maximise leisure time by combining travel with adventure or activity holidays or events.

Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer: “We do expect to see the slow but steady signs of recovery that have been characteristic of 2014 continue into next year.

‘We are seeing strong growth from the most affluent end of the market and we expect this to drive interest in luxury and tailor made packages.

‘The rest of the market remains resilient with value for money continuing to be a priority. ‘Holidaymakers want their holiday to work hard for them, whether that’s by offering new experiences, combining different destinations or simply delivering great value.’
