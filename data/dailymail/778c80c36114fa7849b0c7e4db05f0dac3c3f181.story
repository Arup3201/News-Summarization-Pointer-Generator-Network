Mrs Walker died from stab wounds to the torso and neck according to an autopsy - the Medical Examiner's office has classified her death as a homicide.

His wife's father told Hawaii News Now that he doesn't think his son-in-law could have committed the crime. 

Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman Chris Grey told KITV investigators do not believe Mrs Walker's death was a random act or a robbery and they have identified a person of interest.  

'We are aggressively pursuing all information and leads involving this tragic death,' said Grey.

A close friend of the couple told Hawaii News Now , Mr Walker's car was broken into on Monday, just five days before his wife was found dead

The couple did not have children and according to Mr Walker's Facebook page, he is a medic in the Army

The Walkers' neighbors note that the security gate at the military reservation is not always guarded

'I can confirm that we have a person of interest in this case who our agents are taking a very hard look at, but it's important to point out that we continue to look at all possibilities and evidence in order to conduct a complete and thorough investigation.'

A close friend of the couple told Hawaii News Now, Mr Walker's car was broken into on Monday, just five days before his wife was found dead.

She said Mrs Walker told her her husband's  wallet was stolen and she was fearful of someone coming to the house.  

Friends, said Mrs Walker was a devout Mormon, who was softly spoken. 

The couple did not have children and according to Mr Walker's Facebook page, he is a medic in the Army.

The Walkers' neighbors note that the security gate at the military reservation is not always guarded.

"It's really scary because there's no security on base. So anybody can just come in and out. So it could've been anybody," said resident Shantell Simmons-Agnew.
