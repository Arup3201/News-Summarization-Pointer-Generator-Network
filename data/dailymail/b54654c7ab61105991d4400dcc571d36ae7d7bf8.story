It was a case of ‘The Young Man And The Sea’ after a massive swordfish was caught by a 16-year-old boy in Tasmania that weighed over three times his bodyweight and which took him six hours to get into the boat.

The amazing feat was pulled off by teenage fisherman Kyle Longmore - who weighs just 70kg - when he caught the record-breaking 263.5kg broad-bill swordfish about 35km off Tasmania’s East Coast. 

What made the effort even more incredible was that the teenager caught the 263.5kg fish using just 24kg fishing line. It was for this reason it took him so long to reel the huge fish in as he was afraid the line would snap.

'I hooked the fish at 10.45am and we finally landed it in the boat at 4.45pm. I was pretty exhausted by then but once the fish was in the boat I just felt massive relief,' Kyle told Daily Mail Australia 

'Then there was a huge amount of excitement. Lots of screaming and celebrating after that, and a team hug. It’s something I’m very proud of.'

It's believed to be the biggest swordfish ever hooked in Australian waters by amateurs. It beat the current Australian heaviest record catch for using only a 24kg line by 156 kilos, and beat the Australian all-tackle record by 88kg.

Kyle kept the fish and divided it up amongst his mates who helped him to eat it. Normally he uses the 'tag and release' method when he catches fish, but made an exception this time as it was so big and he was going to eat it with his friends.   

Apart from fishing Kyle’s in his first year doing a school-based apprenticeship as an automotive mechanic.

'I’ve been fishing all my life. It took a lot of concentration – a lot of mental and physical work. I just had to stay focused and not give up. After all that you have to hope you can land it,' Kyle says.

‘The worst moment was when it got closer to the boat. It’s when things can go start to go wrong and people start to panic. There’s always a lot more pressure as the fish gets closer to the boat.'  

Kyle battled with the huge fish despite feeling mentally and physically exhausted 

Kyle was onboard his friend Leo Miler’s 7m boat ChoonaChasa while competing in the Coles Bay Classic fishing competition last Saturday when he made his memorable catch. 

Leo explained that Kyle had to stay patient and not rush into making any mistakes. 

'I mean the last three hours of the fight the fish was only 50 metres from the boat swimming around. Kyle just had to be careful because the line was so much lighter than the weight of the fish,' Leo told Daily Mail Australia.

The 16-year-old was able to catch the massive swordfish using only 24kg fishing line

'It jumped about 23 times to try and get rid of the hook, but we still weren’t sure how big it was. It was only when we got it onto the boat that we realised the size of it.

'Kyle was really physically and mentally finished by the end. He really had to concentrate the whole time and not stop for a moment.

'He did tremendously well for a boy of his age to land this kind of a fish. He’s obviously a naturally talented fisherman.'
