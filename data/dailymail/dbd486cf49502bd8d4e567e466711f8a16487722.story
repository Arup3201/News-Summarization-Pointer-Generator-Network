One of Britain’s oldest shops is closing after the recession left owners unable to renew the 126-year-old lease.

The Famous, a menswear shop in Cheltenham, opened in 1886 selling trousers for 13 shillings (65p), a suit for 30 shillings (£1.50) and overcoats at 4/11 (24p).

It is one of the last shops in the country to operate the once popular Lamson vacuum system, which sends money to a cashier’s office.

But owners of the family-run business selling men’s clothing now say it must close - because they cannot afford to renew the lease.

The Cole family have been renting the property from a private landlord since it opened but now cannot afford to keep it going.

It will close at the end of the year after 126 years of trading in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Chairman Ross Cole, the great grandson of AN Cole, who bought the business in 1896, has worked at the shop for more than 50 years.

Closing down: The current chairman Ross Cole has said the lease has become unaffordable for the much loved business

He said: 'The building is very expensive to maintain and stay in and obviously we have felt the pinch quite a bit.

'This has been offering for the last two years and we knew we had reached the point where we had to make a decision either way.

'The business is still going well but we decided, after discussing among ourselves, that we simply couldn’t replicate what we have here in a modern shop premises.

'It’s a very sad day and I have already umpteen letters and phone calls from customers which brings tears to my eyes.

'We are very grateful for the tremendous support and loyalty we have received from our customers over so many years.'

The Famous opened its doors at the present site in the same year as Coca Cola was launched and both Cheltenham Town and Arsenal football clubs were founded.

Menswear director, Richard Cole, 36, said: 'It is a shame and it will be missed by our customers, we have had some very long standing ones.

'We have had the lease since the opening of the shop, but the price of the lease has gone up in the recession.'

Down the tube: Cashier Dawn Hodges picks up a money capsule sent from the shop floor via a suction tube system, which can be seen on the wall behind her.

Cash flow: The tube system was installed in 1930 and is thought to be one of the oldest of its type in the country, moving capsules filled with cash using vacuum technology

Landmark: The Famous store is to close its doors for the last time after 126 years

The shop will be holding a closing down sale from November 1.

It will still operate a children’s clothing store in new premises in the spa town.

Martin Quantock, Cheltenham’s town centre manager, said: 'The Famous menswear store is something of a landmark.

'There are not many people who went to school in Cheltenham who have not worn school uniform from there.'

The Famous opened its doors in 1886, when Queen Victoria (pictured right) was on the throne.

It was also the year of the first ever Crufts dog show in London and the year that Arsenal Football Club was established. Despite proudly being a north London team nowadays, it was set up by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London, under the name Dial Square.

Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde was also first published in 1886.

There were some similarities to modern Britain though. In February there were two days of rioting in London, which led later that year to the introduction of the Riot (Damages) Act that enabled property owners to claim compensation from police in the event of damage due to a riot.
