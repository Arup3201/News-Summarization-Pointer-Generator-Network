Sporting Gijon are resigned to losing striker Stefan Scepovic to Celtic this week — for a lot less than the £3.2million asking price they had slapped on the Serbian.

Scepovic didn’t travel with the Sporting squad for Saturday night’s Spanish Segunda Division away win over Numancia, with Sporting coach Abelardo Fernandez admitting: ‘His exit is imminent.' 

Imminent: Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic did not travel with Sporting Gijon for their match against Numancia

Precaution: The Spanish-based player was left out to ensure that the deal can go through in the coming days

'He was left out of this game to avoid injury that could influence negotiations.’

Although Sporting directors say they want something close to the four million Euro valuation they’ve put on Scepovic, they need to sell urgently – and are expected to let the 24-year-old go to Celtic in a cut-price deal within the next 72 hours.

Parkhead manager Ronny Deila is also confident of finalising the loan deal for Rubin Kazan winger Wakaso Mubarak this week, although neither player will be involved in Tuesday night’s Champions League play-off decider against Maribor.
