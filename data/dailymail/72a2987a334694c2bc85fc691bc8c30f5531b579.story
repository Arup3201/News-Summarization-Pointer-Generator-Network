As controversy surrounds his imminent return from a thigh injury and subsequent absence from Roy Hodgson's latest England squad, the 25-year-old will be seen modelling jackets in the magazine's November issue.

While many may disagree, Sturridge insisted that not all footballer's are badly dressed as he praised some of his teammate's style credentials.

'Hendo (Jordan Henderson) dresses quite well. (Mamadou) Sakho is very dressy, he'll show up for training in a smart shirt and shoes, though I think that's a Parisian thing. Brad Jones has a go. Loves a blazer, Brad Jones...' he said.

As the national team prepare for Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia without their first choice centre forward, Sturridge reflected on England's ill-fated World Cup campaign in Brazil.

'Obviously, it was disappointing. But I lived one of my dreams: I scored a goal at the World Cup. I feel that I gave a good account of myself.'
