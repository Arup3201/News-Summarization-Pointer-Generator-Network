Police in Colorado rammed the suspects in a triple murder off the highway during a high-speed pursuit.

Officers in Jefferson County spotted a black Jeep Wrangler which was linked to the multiple homicide in near-by Adams County in north west Denver. 

The local sheriff attempted to pull over the vehicle which sped off at high speed. Following a chase the police car used a so-called PIT manoeuver to force the car to stop.

Police in Denver were called to the scene of a triple murder, pictured,  following a frantic 911 call  

Forensic officers carefully examined the crime scene in Westminster, Adams County in Denver  

While searching the scene, sheriffs in neighbouring Jefferson County arrested two men following a car chase 

The police car nudged the rear corner of the jeep forcing it to spin around and crash off the road. 

Two people in the car were arrested at the scene which was near the Bandimere Speedway. 

The chase followed the murder of three people in the Westminster area of Denver on Wednesday.

Police attended the scene after a distraught woman called 911 reporting a disturbance at the home before hanging up. 

Officers discovered three bodies inside the $170,000 home after they investigated the emergency call.  

Commander Terrance O'Neill said the Adams County Sheriff's Office was investigating the murder and confirmed that multiple victims were found at the scene.

Deputies were looking for a man described as a person of interest who was seen leaving the modest, single-level residence.

Outside the home later on Wednesday, investigators had placed at least a dozen markers typically used to flag evidence, such as gunshots, in the driveway and street. 

Westminster is a northwest suburb of Denver with a population of around 100,000 people.  

The scene of the murder was cordoned off while investigators searched for vital evidence
