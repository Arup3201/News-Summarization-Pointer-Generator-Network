A mother of five has spoken about how she burst into tears after she says she was kicked out of a Jobcentre for breastfeeding her baby.

Tara Powell had taken her four-month-old son Preston with her to the centre in Bromley, south-east London, where she had an appointment to discuss her income support money.

The 29-year-old said she was giving her details to the staff member when her son began to cry and she started to feed him. But she claims the worker told her: ‘Can you stop doing what you are doing?’

Miss Powell, of Orpington, said the interviewer then told her she felt ‘uncomfortable’. But the mother replied: ‘There’s nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son, it’s natural.’

However the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was ‘disgusting’, adding: ‘If you do not stop it, I’m terminating this interview’.

Miss Powell claimed she put her son’s blanket over him so the Jobcentre woman could not see him feeding - but she was again told it was ‘disgusting’.

Miss Powell added: ‘She was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview. I was crying because she did that to me. She kicked me out for breastfeeding my son.

‘I have never ever felt so embarrassed. She would not have moaned if someone had bottle fed their baby. After I got out of the room I burst out crying.’

Miss Powell said a manager apologised following the incident last Friday, and told her the appointment would have to be rebooked with a different adviser this week.

Miss Powell added: ‘I have five kids and I breastfed four of them and I have never been told do not do it. By law I can feed my baby where I like and there is no place where you cannot feed your baby.’

A Department for Work & Pensions spokesman said Miss Powell was offered a private place to feed her baby after the meeting was ended, adding that the incident was being investigated.

She said: ‘We have apologised to Ms Powell for any inconvenience and confusion caused during her visit to the Jobcentre.

'Mothers are welcome to feed their babies when visiting us. This can take place wherever the mother feels comfortable - either in a public area or a private room if one is available.’

A spokesman for We Do It in Public, a campaign group supporting breastfeeding in public, said: ‘Perceptions of breastfeeding in public still continues to be a sticking point for both new and experienced mums who choose to breastfeed.

‘It’s such a shame that as a society we are still seeing cases where people are asked to leave public places, just because they are feeding their baby.’
