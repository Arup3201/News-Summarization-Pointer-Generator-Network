Despite being rivals in both their careers and love lives, new letters by Bobby Kennedy (right) reveal he admired his elder brother John

He may have been a member of the charismatic Kennedy family, but new letters penned by a teenage Bobby Kennedy reveal he worried about not being able to attract women.

Writing to school-friend Peter MacLellan in 1944, Bobby confessed that he was 'chasing women madly' but added: 'it seems as if I lack the Kennedy charm.'

In the letters, which have remained hidden for almost 70 years, Bobby also speaks of his admiration for his older brother, John, and his war heroics.

In one letter, Bobby writes: 'I’m going home this weekend to see my brother Jack who is now going into PT (patrol torpedo) boats...so I’m getting out to see him because he might be killed any minute.' 

Later, a boat John F Kennedy was commanding sunk after being rammed by a Japanese destroyer. 

John saved the life of one of his men by swimming to safety with his life-vest belt held in his teeth, prompting Bobby to write, asking: 'Did you see [John's] story about the boat?'

While Bobby's love life would later become the stuff of legend, with biographers claiming he had affairs with with Marilyn Monroe and his brother's widow, during his early years he worried about attracting women.

On July 3, 1944, he wrote to Mr MacLellan, saying: 'I am now chasing women madly but it looks as if I lack the Kennedy charm as I have yet to find a girl who likes me.

'But then I don’t quit easily so I’m still in there struggling. How’s that love life of yours?'

The letters also show Bobby's funny side. In one he teases his friend, singing off: 'From your mental & physical superior and your better in football, hockey and baseball, Robert Francis Kennedy.'

In another, he writes 'I’m still healthy, strong . . . and good looking as ever', reports the Boston Globe.

While the letters show Bobby's sporting ability may not have matched that of his brothers, he praises his younger sibling Teddy.

In the letters Bobby discusses going back to visit his elder brother before he goes to fight in the Second World War, saying 'he could be killed any minute' (pictured)

Despite claims about Bobby's (left) later love life, including an affair with Marilyn Monroe (centre), in his teenage letters he worried about success with ladies, writing that 'it seems I lack the Kennedy charm'

He says: 'Football is going stinky due to the fact there’s a guy on 2nd team ahead of me who can play ball as well as Teddy, my brother, and the coach thinks he’s better than me. 

'I guess no one appreciates my true qualities . . . The whole thing can go to Hell.'

Mr MacLellan, who dated Kennedy's sister Jean for a time, has kept the notes hidden in a bureau in his bedroom, still stuffed inside their original envelopes.

However, now aged 90, he has decided to put them up for auction before he passes away.

The letters from Bobby will go up for sale on September 18 at RR Auctions in Boston, along with a set of letters written by John F Kennedy.

The letters from John Kennedy were written to the family of Harold Marney, one of the sailors killed after Kennedy's boat was sunk during the Second World War.

In the letters Bobby also laments his lack of sporting abilities after being dropped from his school's baseball team, though he praises his younger brother Teddy as a football player

At first the Marney family write to John asking for news of their son, who was officially listed as missing in action, and he writes back offering his condolences.

However, after Joe Kennedy was killed in an air crash, the roles are reversed as the Marneys wrote to John offering their own sympathies for his loss.

John F. Kennedy's letters are expected to fetch $40,000, while bids for Robert Kennedy's correspondence are expected to reach $20,000.
