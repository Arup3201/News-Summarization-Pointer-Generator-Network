A 10-year-old horse has been shot in the face with a crossbow in a brutal act of animal cruelty.

The RSPCA is appealing for help after Bambi, a chestnut mare, was shot in the nose with a 20 inch bolt arrow, believed to be fired from a crossbow, in Barnsley, south Yorkshire.

The injured pony was spotted by a horrified member of the public on Monday night at around 7pm in a field in Barnsley.

The member of the public contacted the RSPCA, however inspectors were not able to get near Bambi without causing further distress to the animal.

Inspector Joanne Taylor called out a vet who assessed the horse from a distance and concluded it was safe to leave her until the owners arrived, as to catch her would have caused her more anxiety.

Bambi was taken was to the equine unit of a local vet on Tuesday, where X-rays revealed the arrow had gone into the sinus four inches deep.

Experts say that the chestnut mare was lucky the arrow hadn't gone through her face as she would have died

The arrow was removed and her puncture wound stitched up.

Her owners, who do not wish to be named, said: 'We were horrified by what had happened, and so upset to think that someone was wandering around the area brandishing a dangerous weapon.'

Vet Bill Black said: 'Bambi was extremely lucky that the arrow had not struck her in the forehead as she would have been dead.'

The arrow was 20 inches long and was embedded four inches into the horse's sinus

Inspector Taylor said: 'This was a horrific and deliberate act of animal cruelty on a defenceless animal.

'The arrow had caused Bambi so much distress, every time she moved she banged it causing her more pain and it really unnerved her, you could tell she was terrified by what had happened.

'We believe this arrow bolt is likely to have been fired from a cross bow, the bolt had one red and two yellow quills on it.'
