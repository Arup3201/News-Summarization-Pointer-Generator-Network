James Ward-Prowse has committed his future to Southampton by penning a new five-and-a-half-year deal at St Mary's.

A graduate of the club's academy, the 20-year-old has made 77 appearances in all competitions since making his debut in October 2011.

Ward-Prowse has become an increasingly important player for Saints and has now been rewarded with a new and improved contract, keeping him at the club until 2020.

The England Under-21s international has been with Saints since the age of eight and believes an exciting future lies ahead at St Mary's.

"The club is in a fantastic position and ever since I joined the club at a young age I knew it was the right place to be," Ward-Prowse told Southampton's YouTube channel.

"I fell in love with the place straight away.

"I've been on a fantastic journey, the club has too, and it's great to extend my stay. I'm really excited for the next few years.

"You only have to look at the players we've produced over the last few years to see it is the right place."

Ward-Prowse has made 17 appearances for Saints this season, despite missing a large chunk of it with a fractured foot.

He has played a part in all 11 matches since returning in mid-December and is someone Ronald Koeman has high hopes for.

"He's one of the young players who is developing himself in a very good way. He will be a great player," the Southampton manager said.

"It's always good news, I'm happy that he would like to stay with us. It's a good signal to the rest of the players.

"He's one of the examples for the academy, to the confidence of the young players.

"'Prowsey' developed in the academy and now he's one of the young players who plays for the first team.

"He's a good professional, always serious in his training, in his discipline, he's a big example for all young players."
