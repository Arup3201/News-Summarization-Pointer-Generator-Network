The BBC has splashed out nearly £24,000 in hospitality and appearance fees for just ten MPs, including senior former Cabinet ministers.

Gifts to MPs from the taxpayer-funded corporation include VIP hospitality tickets and all-expenses paid trips abroad to film documentaries.

Labour MPs received the biggest payments, with former Home Secretary Alan Johnson being paid £12,000 for just 40 hours work at the BBC - the equivalent to £300 an hour - where he has made regular TV and radio appearances.

And Diane Abbott was paid £3,278 - including £500 for appearing on the quiz show Pointless, £600 for University Challenge, £500 for travel and an appearance on Sunday Morning Live in Northern Ireland and two payments of £839 for This Week. 

BBC Wales provided tickets in its hospitality box worth £781 each for the Wales vs Ireland Six Nations rugby match at the Millenium Stadium in Cardiff for Labour MPs Nia Griffith and Owen Smith.

While Peter Hain, a Labour MP who was born in Africa, was sent on an all-expenses paid trip to South Africa to film a documentary about its future, for which he received £2,900 to cover expenses.

Tory MP Philip Davies was also sent on a paid trip to Florida worth £1,290 to make a programme about the death penalty.

The payments were all declared on the 
MP's latest register of financial interests, which details income 
received by MPs outside their salary in approximately the last 18 
months.

Other recipients of the BBC's generosity include Conservative MP Glyn Davies, who was paid £900 for six newspaper reviews and £600 for interviews by BBC News 24, as well as £150, plus unspecified travel expenses, for appearing on BBC Wales show Pawb a'i Farn.

Former Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell declared receiving £250 for an interview and £500 for an unspecified television appearance at the BBC, while former Home Secretary David Blunkett was paid £250 for an appearance on Sunday Morning Live.

Tory John Whittingdale was paid £150 for an appearance on Any Questions.

Matthew Sinclair, of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told The Sun that the spending by the BBC was 'hard to justify when budgets are so tight'.

A BBC spokesman said: 'In general, we do not pay a fee to politicians to appear on BBC programmes to talk about party political matters. If they are making a filmed report or appearing as a presenter they may be offered a modest fee.'

Defending the tickets given to MPs to attend the rugby match at the Millennium Stadium, he added: 'The box at the Millennium Stadium is provided to us as a result of our broadcasting deal with the Welsh Rugby Union and is not subject to a separate payment. We invite a wide range of guests from political parties as well as stakeholders from a range of other organisations.'
