A restaurant owner stalked a wealthy housewife as she went shopping for groceries for a year - despite her determined attempts to give him the slip.

Married father-of-two Tony Leung, 49, terrorised Michelle Warnes by following her around the aisles of Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer stores.

The mother-of-one was so scared of the unwanted admirer that she regularly switched supermarkets, dressed down in tracksuits and borrowed her daughter's car to avoid being recognised.

She also asked her husband to change the personalised plate on her own vehicle.

But Leung kept Mrs Warnes, aged in her 30s, under surveillance in stores across Cheshire, the court was told.

The man - dubbed 'the Supermarket Creep - has now been given a restraining order after being convicted of harassment at Macclesfield magistrates' court.

He was eventually arrested after Mrs Warnes took down the registration number of his Volkswagen Golf car when she spotted him staring at her at a Sainsbury's in Wilmslow, Cheshire.

Leung had been accused of a 'strikingly similar' stalking campaign against another woman but she was unable to give evidence.

Mrs Warnes was so traumatised that she decided to take up self-defence classes, started shopping online and avoids Chinese and Thai restaurants like the one Leung works in.

Confrontation: Tony Leung was accused of stalking and appearing to film Mrs Warnes at this M&S store in Handforth Dean, Cheshire

Each time Leung saw his target he would hold a messenger bag in front of her as if he was filming, the court was told.

In her victim impact statement, read out in court, said: 'I will only shop at one particular shop near to a police station because I feel safe there.

'On occasions I'm always looking for his car if I go out on my own. I have also started to do internet shopping.

'I used to go out often and see girlfriends for lunch but I won't go socialising in Manchester any more. I can't go to certain supermarkets I want to go to.

'The way that I dressed before all this I would never dream of going out in a tracksuit but this is what I wear now. I want to blend in as much as possible. I don't wear any jewellery. I won't take expensive handbags out with me.

'I told my husband that I wanted to change the car as it has a personal registration plate. I'm driving my daughter's car because it's less obvious.

'I have spoken to my personal trainer who has suggested self-defence classes. I have CCTV in my driveway and garden and monitor this as well so I can see what's going on.'

Leung began stalking Mrs Warnes in May 2010 as she shopped in Sainsbury's in Altrincham.

Giving her evidence from behind a screen she said: 'I was in the store when I noticed this Chinese man following and staring at me.

'It was clear he wanted to make eye contact with me. He scared me and made me feel very unsafe. Then he just disappeared. It happened about three times at the store and on the last occasion I told the security guard.

'I did not feel safe and stopped wearing nice clothes and jewellery and wouldn't carry a handbag.

'Creep': Mrs Warnes also spotted restaurateur Tony Leung, 49, in this Sainsbury's store in Wilmslow

'I always dressed nicely so my daughter and husband noticed. I even started using my daughter's car and was so frightened I didn't want to leave the house and started to order food online.'

Mrs Warnes switched to a Marks & Spencers store eight miles away at Handforth Dean, near Wilmslow but Leung appeared there too.

In May last year she moved stores again this time to Sainsbury's in Wilmslow only to burst into tears when she found Leung standing in front of her.

She added: 'He stopped directly in front of me and stared and I broke down and cried. He always had a messenger bag and kept moving it. It felt like he was filming me.'

In May last year police went to Leung's home in Wilmslow to warn him about his behaviour but Mrs Warnes bumped into him again at another supermarket and he was arrested a month later.

Leung, whose wife works at Manchester Airport, denied harassment but was convicted after a trial.

He said: 'I have two children I take to school in Altrincham and so sometimes I shop there.

'I live in Wilmslow so I also shop in the various supermarkets around the town. I don't always buy goods when I'm there - sometimes I go to compare prices.'

In mitigation defence lawyer John Wolfson said: 'He's a man of prior good character and he has a family of young children and a business.

'He and his family have been very upset about what might happen to him. The mind plays strange tricks sometimes. She may have genuinely believed Mr Leung was acting inappropriately but in truth he was not.'

Leung was given a 12 month community order with supervision requirements and ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay £620 court costs and £1,000 compensation to the victim.

Leung said he intends to appeal against his conviction.
