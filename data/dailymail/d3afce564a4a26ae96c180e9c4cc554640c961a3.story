A university has banned its cricket team from playing after a squad member wore a shirt with his nickname, 'Casual Rape', printed on the back.

The cricketers at Aberystwyth University caused outrage by wearing pink polo tops with 'tasteless' names during a night out.

As a result, the club has been stripped of its funding and has been banned from representing the university in future tournaments.

Offensive: The unidentified player wore the shirt with his 'nickname' printed above the squad number while at a pub with teammates

The players had a range of names on their
 clothing but one, 'Casual Rape', was 
deemed to be unacceptable by the university's disciplinary panel.

Union activities officer Liv Prewett, said: 'Sexual harassment is not tolerated by Aberystwyth student union.

Disgusted: Union activities officer Liv Prewett said the club's behaviour had brought the Student Union into disrepute

'All affiliated sports clubs and societies should understand the severity of this case and any further incidents of the kind will be dealt with in the same manner.

'I am deeply disappointed and have openly expressed my disgust.'

The disciplinary panel heard the cricketers thought the 'Casual Rape' shirt would be taken as a joke.

The hearing was told how one cricketer said: 'People joked about it so we thought they may be seeing the funny side of it.'

But the Student Union ruled the shirt was 'distasteful and completely unacceptable'.

They found the cricket team had breached their code of conduct and brought the club and the student union into disrepute.

They banned the team from competing in the British Universities and Colleges Sport’s indoor cricket tournament.

And they withdrew grant funding which pays for the club’s equipment and travel expenses to play matches against other universities.

A spokesman for the university cricket club said: 'We understand the severity of the situation and steps are being undertaken to ensure no further offence is caused.

'Nothing of this nature will happen again - any reference to rape in that manner is completely unacceptable and is not, nor will it be, condoned in the future.'

The polo shirt, printed by a local company in Aberystwyth, was handed over to union leaders to ensure it will not be worn again.

The incident comes a week after students at Oxford University were disciplined for telling members of their college rugby teams they could pick a 'fresher of their choice' and spike their drink during a night out.

Warning: The student's union at Aberystwyth University has told all other clubs and societies this type of behaviour would be dealt with severely
