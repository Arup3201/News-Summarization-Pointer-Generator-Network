Governors of Britain's first Muslim free school may have conflicting links with suppliers 
and £20,000 of 'irregular payments' have been discovered in its 
accounts, a leaked Government audit has revealed.

The Department for Education (DfE) is to hold talks with the Al-Madinah school in Derby, just weeks after it was branded 'dysfunctional' and 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors.

The DfE report, obtained by Channel 4 News, says some governors at 'are closely involved with suppliers to the school either directly or through family connections'.

The audit, published in September, also said the Muslim faith school 'cannot currently demonstrate that it is maintaining proper accounting records' and revealed that auditors had identified 'irregular payments' of almost £20,000, according to the broadcaster.

Last month the school was placed in special measures, and Shazia Parveen, the chair of governors, announced she was to step down from her position.

Education Minister Lord Nash will today meet the governors of the school to decide on its future.

Channel 4 News said the DfE's leaked audit said the school had been left with a 'complicated' governance situation after the resignations of the principal, vice principal and business manager.

According to the audit, those who had conflicts of interest are reported to be one former governor and one current governor whose companies supplied the school, one governor with relatives working as suppliers to the school and another governor with a relative working at the school.

It found further potential conflicts with one governor whose company provides HR services to the school.

There was also found to be no complete record of expenditure or receipts from September 2012 to August this year.

The report also exposed gaps in policies at the school, which it said had no guidance on what travel expenses or meals could be claimed.

Ofsted's report, published last month, condemned the running of the school, concluding that the governing body is ineffective and had failed to appreciate how poor pupils' experiences are.

It stated: 'The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.'

Al-Madinah, which has been criticised following claims it discriminated against women, required staff to cover their hair regardless of their religion, and made girls sit at the back of the class, was rated inadequate in each of the categories Ofsted examines.

Al-Madinah, which is one of the Government's flagship free schools and is run by the Al- Madinah Education Trust, opened last September.

On its website it describes 'a strong Muslim ethos' with shorter holidays and longer school days 'to maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and success'.

Criticism: The report of the Ofsted inspection rated Al-Madinah as 'inadequate' on every criterion last month

A DfE spokesman said: 'Lord Nash wrote to Shazia Parveen, the Chair of the Al-Madinah Trust, on October 8 placing 17 requirements on the Trust, which they must satisfy or risk their Funding Agreement being terminated. The last of those deadlines has now passed.

'We are actively considering the responses from the Trust. It would be inappropriate to go into any further detail at this stage.'

Britain's first Muslim free school, Al-Madinah, opened in September last year but since then has been dogged by criticism.

According to 
the former head teacher and his deputy, who claim they were forced to leave, it is 
controlled by religious hardliners who ban children from singing or 
reading fairy tales and force staff to wear headscarves.

Andrew
Cutts-McKay resigned from his role as head in August, two months after his number two Suzanne Southerland stepped 
down from her post.

Both allege they were 'bullied and sidelined'
by members of the school's trust, which is predominantly Muslim. The 
school strongly denies the pair's claims.

When it emerged Ofsted found the school inadequate last month David Cameron admitted: 'I am not afraid to shut the school'.

Also in October, a mother said she is pulling her teenage son out after he was forced to cover his head and banned from looking at female students.

Jacqueline Crossley, 53, has said her son, who she does not want to be identified, is the only non-religious pupil at the school in Derby.

She has now decided to withdraw the 14-year-old from the school after claiming he was forced to join lessons with five-year-olds when he opted out of lessons studying the Qu'ran.

Recently,
there have been reports in the media that female teachers at the school
were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.

Other reports claimed that female pupils were made to sit at the back of the classroom and males at the front.

On
its website, it describes 'a strong Muslim ethos' with shorter holidays
and longer school days 'to maximise opportunities for pupil achievement
and success'.

It adds: 'At
the centre of our school is a community of pupils, able to enjoy 
learning in a caring Islamic environment which promotes a culture of 
high expectations and outstanding performance.'
