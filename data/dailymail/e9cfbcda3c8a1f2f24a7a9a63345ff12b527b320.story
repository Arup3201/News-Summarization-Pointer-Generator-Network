Nailed it: Cobbler, Charles Powell, 69, saw off the threat from Tesco, who withdrew their plan to open a new shoe repair outlet nearby

These days independent shops are all too often struggling and the future looked especially bleak for cobbler Charles Powell.

With Tesco planning to open a shoe repair outlet in the supermarket car park opposite, he feared it was the death knell for the little shop that has been his pride and joy, not to mention his livelihood, for 30 years.

So the 69-year-old shopkeeper from the small town of Cradley Heath in the Black Country wrote to the store chain’s chairman Sir Richard Broadbent to express his worries… and in a remarkable David versus Goliath victory, Tesco withdrew its planning application.

Mr Powell, who was backed by a petition from 250 customers, said: ‘You can’t let these big businesses steamroller the smaller shops.

‘I am not against competition, but as a single trader I couldn’t have competed with a business on a car park supported by such a huge supermarket chain that could open from 8am to 7pm seven days a week.

‘Besides, there are plenty of empty shops in Cradley Heath high street.’

In what may seem as a surprisingly humane response from the world of big business, Tesco described the support he received from his customers as ‘heart-warming’ and even invited him to have coffee with the local supermarket’s manager.

Mr Powell has run C&C Shoe Repairs since 1984. He refuses to retire because he enjoys his work so much.

Like many high streets, Cradley Heath’s has been hit by competition from out-of-town shopping centres as well as online shopping.

Mr Powell found out about the Timpson ‘pod’ offering shoe, phone and watch repairs, plus dry cleaning, photo ID, key cutting and engraving services, from a planning notice that was stuck on a lamppost near his shop. 

Timpson, which opened its 1,000th shop in Britain in January, announced plans to open at least 150 branches during 2014.

Despite objections from traders to the branch at Cradley Heath, planning officers recommended councillors approve the application, which was made by Tesco.

They said they accepted there were empty shops in the high street but pointed out that the pod was very small and retailers were welcome in the town centre.

The application was due before Sandwell Council this week, but was ditched by Tesco last week.

Liz Johnston, a Tesco customer services executive, wrote to Mr Powell saying she was sorry the proposal had caused him so much worry and telling him that she had contacted the local store and Tesco’s planning department ‘to see if we could have this decision overturned’.

She added: ‘Given the overwhelming support you received from the residents of Cradley Heath, they have all agreed it would be wrong to open a Timpson’s in this store.

‘It was heart-warming to see the support you received from your customers. We realise how important your business is to them and are happy to support your continued presence in the high street.’

Mr Powell said: ‘I have done my little bit for my business and I appreciated Tesco’s decision. You have to help yourself sometimes.’

He added: ‘I want to thank customers and fellow traders for their tremendous support.’

Mr Powell has put the letter he received from Tesco in his shop window. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We always try and do the right thing for the communities we serve.’
