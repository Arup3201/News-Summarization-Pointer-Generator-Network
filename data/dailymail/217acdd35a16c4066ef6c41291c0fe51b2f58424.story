The sole survivor of a horrific car accident which killed five young friends last weekend after their car careened off a road in Burbank, California, attended the Friday funeral for one of her friends.

Savannah Underwood, 18, was pushed in a wheelchair, her broken leg in a cast, to the funeral held Friday for Malak Hariri. It was the first funeral for victims of the violent collision, which also killed Sameer Nevarez, Sugey Cuevas, Stephen Stoll and Sebastian Forero.

Ms Underwood was found by police about 50 yards away from the charred Nissan sedan when they arrived shortly after 4 a.m.Investigators intially said she was thrown from the car, but she told them she crawled out of the wreckage.

Severely injured: Ms Underwood suffered a crushed pelvis and a broken right leg in the accident

Ms Underwood suffered a broken leg and a crushed pelvis in the accident, according to KTLA. She was released Thursday from Los Angeles County Medical Center.

Her appearance at Ms Malak's funeral was the first time she had publicly paid tribute to any of her fallen friends. The wheelchair-confined young woman was visibly distraught and carrying flowers, she did not speak to the media.

Though Ms Underwood smelled of alcohol the night of the crash, investigators are awaiting toxicology test results to determine if drinking or drugs played a factor in the smash, KTLA reported.

The five young adults all appear to have been friends since attending Burbank High School and graduated within the past few years.

Tributes poured in from the school community and devastated family and friends of those who died.

‘Heaven gained 5 angels today and 
they gave us clear skies and a beautiful day. Rest in paradise. You will 
never be forgotten,’ wrote Jamie Hizzle.

A relative of Malak Hariri simply wrote: 'No words'.

'She's a very smart girl, very good girl, very respectful girl. She never had problems at home with us," said Suhilah Hariri, another relative told Fox News.

Officials said they were still looking into the cause of the accident but feared speed could have been a factor.

The curving stretch of roadway has a posted 45 mph speed limit, but vehicles often fly off the freeway at speeds closer to 70 mph, and accidents have happened in the area in the past, according to authorities.

The accident took place around 4am but by the time the emergency services reached the vehicle it was too late. 

Fire Battalion Chief Ron Barone told Fox: 'There was absolutely no possibility of any rescue whatsoever'.

Lone survivor: Savannah Underwood, 18, somehow survived the accident after being ejected from the car
