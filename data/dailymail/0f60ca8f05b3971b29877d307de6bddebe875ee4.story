Shadow education spokesman Tristram Hunt (pictured) is set to attack the 'Berlin Wall' between the fee-paying and state education system today

The headmaster of Tristram Hunt’s former school yesterday accused Labour’s education spokesman of ‘offensive bigotry’ after he threatened to strip private schools of tax breaks worth £700million.

Mark Beard, head of £17,835-a-year University College School in Hampstead, North London, said the policy by one of his old boys was ‘tasteless’.

He spoke out after Mr Hunt railed against a ‘Berlin Wall’ between private and state education which had created a ‘corrosive divide of privilege’.

In a speech, Mr Hunt unveiled plans to make private schools forge stronger links with state schools or face losing the tax relief. Their efforts must include competing with state schools at football and other sports instead of running ‘exclusive private-only competitions’, he said.

But his plan to put private schools under a legal duty to co-operate with the state system triggered a backlash among head teachers in both sectors.

Critics accused Labour of declaring a new class war after failing nearly a decade ago to threaten the charitable status of private schools.

The party was also accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ as it emerged that one in four members of the Shadow Cabinet went to private schools, including Mr Hunt, Harriet Harman and Ed Balls.

Mr Beard, whose school was attended by Mr Hunt in the late 1980s, said Labour was ignoring a wealth of partnerships that already operate between private and state schools. He said the party appeared to be attempting to ‘rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector’.

He added: ‘Isn’t it time for Labour to come up with some new, helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry?’

Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, accused Mr Hunt of promoting a ‘1980s view of education’.

He said: ‘Does Dr Hunt think that when Mr Chips from the independent school drifts in to teach a bit of history at the local state school because his head has told him to under instruction from Dr Hunt that this is going to transform the relationship between state and private school? It’s patronising nonsense.’

The plans also drew criticism from a union representing thousands of head teachers and senior staff in state secondary schools, which warned against setting up ‘more legislative hoops for schools to jump through’.

Some 2,570 fee-paying schools can claim an 80 per cent cut in business rates because they are charities, and in 2013 they saved £165million in this way.

But Mr Hunt insisted that many private schools provide only token benefits to their communities, such as entry to art exhibitions for three hours a day or allowing occasional use of a football field.

Under Labour’s blueprint, private schools will be required to pass a partnership test to keep their business rate relief, which is estimated to be worth £700million over the course of the next Parliament.

As well joint sports tournaments, this could include sharing teachers, running courses to help state pupils get into leading universities and sponsoring state academies.

Speaking at a state school in East London, Mr Hunt said the taxpayer was expected to subsidise ‘the education of a privileged few’.

He added: ‘It baffles me that we can have private schools loaning a sports pitch to the local comprehensive once or twice a year yet completely refusing to play them at football, opening up their halls and amphitheatres yet unwilling to engage in a debating competition.’

But critics said tournaments such as the annual English schools’ rugby competition were open to state and independent schools.

Private school leaders said 90 per cent of fee-paying schools were ‘involved in meaningful and effective partnerships with state schools’. Mr Lenon added: ‘Independent schools generate £4.7billion in tax and save the taxpayer £4billion, equivalent to building 460 schools, by educating children out of the state school sector.’

Peter Kent, president of the Association of School and College Leaders, and head of Lawrence Sheriff grammar school in Rugby, said partnerships only worked when they were ‘entered into willingly’.

‘More can be done to encourage schools to work together, but forcing collaboration through regulation will not work,’ he added.

Mr Hunt will also say the 'corrosive divide of privilege' is harming children's prospects (file picture, posed)

‘In much of the country, state and independent schools have a healthy working relationship.’

Tory critics said the policy was an attempt to appeal to core voters following the resignation of Emily Thornberry as Shadow Attorney General over a tweet that was seen as patronising working people.

Dominic Raab, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘This rank hypocrisy from Labour is a pathetic attempt to regain some socialist street cred after the resignation of Emily Thornberry.

‘It won’t bother the big public schools the likes of Tristram Hunt, Harriet Harman and Ed Balls went to. But it will hurt small independent schools charging more modest fees to aspirational middle-class families. Ed Miliband is reviving class warfare, not social mobility.’

But Mr Hunt insisted just 3 per cent of private schools sponsored an academy, while 5 per cent loaned teaching staff to state schools and a third shared facilities.

‘The only possible answer to whether they earn their £700million subsidy is a resounding and unequivocal “No”,’ he said.

‘Over the last few years we have seen the limitations of asking private schools politely. So the next government will say, “Step up and play your part. Earn your keep. Because the time you could expect something for nothing is over”.’

A spokesman for Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘This Government has done more than any other to encourage the state and independent sectors to work more closely together.’

Tristram Hunt’s former school has forged links with three state secondaries and several primaries.

University College School is associated with Westminster Academy because the heads of each are governors at the other.

Benefits to pupils at Westminster Academy include help in applying to university, as well as Latin lessons and help with maths and Spanish.

Pupils at UCL Academy in London share University College School’s facilities, such as its swimming pool, while the London Academy of Excellence benefits from advice and support from senior teachers at UCS in subjects such as science and history.

UCS headmaster Mark Beard said: ‘If Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that UCS receives through its charitable status. And UCS is not alone in this regard.’

The Independent Schools Council said 91.6 per cent of members were involved in partnership activities with the state sector.

Among other shared activities, state schools have been playing rugby against independents for 26 years in the Daily Mail Cup, now the NatWest Schools Cup.

The ISC said some independents sponsor state-funded academies while others offer GCSE or A-level revision classes, lend teachers or hold university entrance master-classes. Most schools already share their facilities and are ‘glad to do so’, it said.

State secondaries involved include Labour leader Ed Miliband’s old school – Haverstock, in Camden, North London.

The physics department at fee-paying girls’ South Hampstead High has mentored A-level physics teachers at Haverstock.
