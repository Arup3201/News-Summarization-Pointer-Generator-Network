The body of Margay Edwards, 27, has been found in the Nevada desert

The body of a 27-year-old woman from California has been found in the Nevada desert in a suspected homicide.

Margay Edwards, from Los Osos, was found dead near a dirt track outside of Pahrump by two ATV riders last week.

Clark County coroner's officials haven't released a cause of death.

Nye County Detective Joe McGill did not say whether investigators have suspects or people of interest in the case.

Edwards' license was found on her body, but her authorities are still looking for her cellphone and her car.

'There is a vehicle that was rented by the deceased, which is missing at this time and we need assistance to try to locate that vehicle,' McGill said.

'It's a 2014 metallic blue Hyundai Accent. 

'The license plate number is (California) 7ESZ966.'

Additionally, McGill said investigators also want to learn exactly who Edwards was with before she went missing more than a week ago, reports Review Journal.

'We know that she was seen in the Pahrump area on September 13,' he said.

'To the best of our knowledge, nobody has seen or spoken to her since. We do know that she had very loose ties to Pahrump. 

'We're treating this as a criminal investigation.'

Sheriff Tony DeMeo told KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara that Edwards had been staying in a hotel in Las Vegas.

It was unclear whether she was alone or with friends. 

He said her family most recently contacted her in the second week of September.

Her father Jeff Edwards said told San Luis Obispo his daughter was 'outgoing' and her sociable nature helped her in her work at Firestone Grill in San Luis Obispo, where she held various positions before moving to San Diego a couple of years ago to study business at San Diego State University.

'She hadn't settled on a specific career,' Jeff Edwards said.

'She liked sports and may have done something in that arena.'

He said he last saw his daughter earlier in September, and didn't know how Margay ended up in Nevada.

NBC 7 traced Edwards to a Vista apartment where she recently lived and were told by the current tenant told that San Diego County Sheriff's investigators visited there in April to asked her if she knew Edwards.

The woman said investigators told her a vehicle registered to Edwards was involved in a hit-and-run crash in Las Vegas and police there were trying to track her down. 

Her body was in advanced stages of decomposition and it took four days to confirm it was Edwards.

It is expected to take up to eight weeks to determine the cause of death.
