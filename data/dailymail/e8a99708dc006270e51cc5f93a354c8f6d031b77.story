Despite appalling weather across much of the east coast yesterday, a double rainbow was pictured in the sky above Marine One as it sat on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.

The helicopter was waiting for the arrival of President Barack Obama, who was flying in on Air Force One on his was to give a speech at Laborfest in Milwaukee.

For much of the east coast Labor Day was marred by heavy thunderstorms as three men were hit by lightning on New York beach and play was stopped at the US Open.

Electric Zoo festival, on Randall Island, was also cancelled after heavy rain flooded the site.

But further down the coast in Maryland the President enjoyed a brief moment of sunshine as the clouds parted and a rainbow appeared across the sky.

Rainbows are caused when light refracts as it enters a raindrop, splitting it into different wavelengths which are seen by the eye as different colors.

Double rainbows occur when the light is reflected as it leaves a raindrop, producing a second, fainter, rainbow nearby, only with the bands of color reversed. 

Obama stopped briefly at the air base before flying on to Milwaukee where he gave a speech at an event on raising the minimum wage ahead of midterm elections in fall.

He also made an appearance at the same air base on Saturday as he travelled with First Lady Michelle to the wedding of long-time personal chef and friend Sam Kass.

Mr Kass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner were tying the knot in an evening ceremony at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, a farm-to-table restaurant in Pocantico Hills, just north of New York City.

Obama and Kass have a close relationship, which Obama highlighted earlier this month by spending hours at dinner at Kass' apartment amid the turmoil in Iraq, Ukraine and Ferguson, Missouri.

Thunderstorms are forecast from Upstate New York and Vermont to West Virginia today, with the weather becoming more settled and sunny into midweek.

However as the weekend approaches another the humidity and heat will rise and there are chances of more storms as the next cold front approaches.
