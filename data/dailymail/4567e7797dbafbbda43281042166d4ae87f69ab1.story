Authorities have released the final distress call of what they believe was a sinking sailboat carrying two adults and two children that is missing in the waters off California.

The group - believed to be a couple, 
their four-year-old son and his young cousin - contacted the Coast Guard when they were 65 miles off Pillar Point Harbor in 
Half Moon Bay on Sunday afternoon.

They reported that their 29-foot sailboat, reportedly named Charmblow, was taking on water and their electronics were failing, Lt Heather Lampert said.

Search: Two adults and two children under the age of eight reported their sailboat was sinking approximately 65 miles off Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay on Sunday and a search is underway

On Monday, The Coast Guard released a portion of an audio recording of the vessel's last communication.

In the crackling recording, a man's voice can be heard saying: 'Coast Guard, Coast Guard, we are abandoning ship. This is the (Charmblow), we are abandoning ship.'

Authorities are now looking for anyone who may recognize the voice on the recording to come forward.

They said they did not have life rafts so were
trying to make one out of a cooler and life preserver ring, Lt Lampert 
said. The Coast Guard then lost radio contact with the group.

The ship's GPS was broken, but they were drifting towards Santa Cruz, the Pacifica Patch reported. Half Moon Bay is about 25 miles south of San Francisco.

But investigators used the boat's radio 
signal and radar to determine the call came from an area about 60 miles 
west of Monterey, Lt Lampert said.

The
National Weather Service had issued an advisory throughout the weekend 
warning boaters of strong winds and rough seas around the Bay Area.

Mariners 'operating smaller vessels should avoid navigating in these conditions', the advisory said.

The searchers did not know who was aboard the sailboat, where it was from or where it was going.

Lampert
said Coast Guard crews were going to conduct a water and air search 
through the night using boats, helicopters and airplanes. So far the 
missing family has not been found.

Authorities used a helicopter, two cutters, a 47-foot rescue boat from Monterey and a C-130 plane from Sacramento, KTVU reported.

The California Air National Guard is also sending a C-130 and another aircraft, Lt Lampert said.

Calls to harbors in California have failed to locate the boat, and database searches have come up empty too, she said.

The Coast Guard was expanding to Hawaii, the Seattle area and north into Canada.

Lt Lampert said Coast Guard crews looked for the family through the night, and the California Air National Guard was assisting with the search.
