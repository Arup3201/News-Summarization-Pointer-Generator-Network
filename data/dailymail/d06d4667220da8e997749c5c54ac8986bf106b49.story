The release of Roy Keane’s updated autobiography has confirmed his status as one of the most intriguing players of the Premier League era.

The revisiting of his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson, that leg breaking tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland and a bust up with Peter Schmeichel have made the headlines.

But the book has also recalled just how powerful a presence he was at Manchester United. The fearsome Irishman was a true midfield general, enforcing Ferguson’s will on the pitch, winning the ball, carrying it forward and pulling everyone around him into line.

Here, Sportsmail considers Keane and some of the other most influential players in the 22-year history of the Premier League.

10. John Terry 

Now in his 17th season as a professional at Chelsea, Terry’s longevity is testament to his talent and unwavering dedication to football. 

He has not always conducted himself well – appearing on the front pages of the papers as well as the back, but his ability as a footballer is unquestionable.

He has an uncanny sense of positioning, rarely misses a tackle and last season made a staggering 600th Premier League appearance.

9. Steven Gerrard 

The 34-year-old has been criticised by some this season with Liverpool not firing on all cylinders. But there is no doubt that he has been consistently the most influential player at Anfield since making his Premier League debut in 1998.

He cemented his status as a Liverpool legend when driving his side to Champions League glory in Istanbul nine years ago. 

He is an expert passer and has reinvented himself in recent years, leading his team from a deep-lying midfield role. His desire to succeed for his boyhood team remains undiminished.

8. Tony Adams 

Adams spanned two eras at Arsenal, which can be summed up by his diet. The pre-Wenger years were sausage sandwiches. After the Frenchman arrived, it was lean meat and pasta but Adams was still at the forefront of the new Arsenal. 

A strong and commanding defender, he was an inspirational leader, encouraging the best from his troops like a wartime general. 

Fittingly, Arsenal won the double in the 2001-02 season, Adams’s final year at the club where he spent his entire career.

7. Ryan Giggs 

Giggs racked up 963 appearances and 34 trophies over 24 seasons as a Manchester United player before retiring at the end of last season. 

He scored in 21 consecutive seasons and hit 109 league goals. The numbers speak for themselves. But few of Giggs’s many opponents over the years describe him as anything but humble.

Although his powers waned over the years and his runs became less blistering, he was still an influential presence in the United dressing room.

6. Frank Lampard 

Even when not permanently signed to a Premier League club, Lampard continues to be influential on loan for Manchester City. But it is 13 glittering years at Chelsea, which took in the most dominant period in the club’s history, that earn him a place on the list. 

Born into a footballing family, what marked Lampard out was his magnificent work ethic. He worked tirelessly and consistently – delivering quietly impressive performances and goals season-after-season for Chelsea and in this campaign became the first player to score against 39 different Premier League sides.

As he gets older, he hasn’t been afraid to adapt, sitting back more and exerting his influence in different ways.

5. Roy Keane 

Sir Alex Ferguson broke the British transfer record to buy Keane from Nottingham Forest – the £3.75m proving a bargain for the man who succeeded Bryan Robson as United’s driving force. 

For what he offered the Premier League in entertainment value, Keane was absolutely priceless. 

Amid all the controversy and fallings out, he defined an era at Manchester United. He was driven by a need to win and helped instill that hunger in the rest of the team. His rivalry with Patrick Vieira was captivating.

4. Alan Shearer 

Simply the most lethal finisher in Premier League history and all time top scorer with 260 goals, almost all celebrated with that famous one arm salute. 

His goals lifted Blackburn to the title in 1995 and a year later signed for his beloved Newcastle for £15m, a world record signing at the time.

Shearer was also completely nerveless, scoring 56 Premier League penalties – the most of any player, by some distance.

3. Patrick Vieira 

When his former team-mates speak of Vieira, one word crops up repeatedly – respect. The former France star engendered respect with his brutal, battling midfield performances.

Vieira let the opposition know - he had an impeccable tactical awareness and during his nine years at Arsenal Wenger employed him as his brains on the pitch.

2. Thierry Henry 

Henry had a slow start to Premier League life, failing to score in his first seven games. But he picked up with a vengeance and boasts the second best minutes to goal ratio (one every 121.8 minutes) of any player to grace the top flight. 

The Frenchman is the gold standard for strikers, tearing through defences with ease and making scoring goals seem so utterly effortless. 

In the Arsenal invincibles side that went uniquely unbeaten in the 2003/04 season, Henry was the shining star.

1. Eric Cantona 

In late November 1992, the Frenchman strutted into Old Trafford with his chest puffed out and went on to shape the future of Manchester United. 

He made an instant impact in a side that hadn’t won a title in 26 years, helping them to win eight and draw two of his first 10 games. He helped United win four titles over his five years there, making goals, scoring and beating players in a fashion not seen before in English football.

He had his controversial moments as well - such as when he kicked a spectator at Selhurst Park in 1995.

But he made much more of an impact on the pitch.
