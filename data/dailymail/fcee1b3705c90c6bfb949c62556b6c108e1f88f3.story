Goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen has signed a new one-year contract at West Ham.

The hugely experienced 39-year-old former Finland international will stay at Upton Park for another season to challenge Adrian for the No 1 position.

Jaaskelainen, who has made 59 appearances for the Hammers since their return to the Premier League in 2012, says he wants to maintain match fitness and will take his opportunities as they come.

'I'm delighted to sign for another season and I'm really looking forward to it,' he told West Ham's official website. 'Hopefully I can put in a proper challenge to get a starting place again.

'Physically, I feel good now and I felt good last season so I hope I can carry on from there and play football.

'You never know what is going to happen next season, but the only thing in my mind is to get myself ready to play.

'I am looking forward so that when that next chance comes, I will be in the right shape and right frame of mind to take it. That's all I'm thinking about now.

'Obviously we all know that, whoever is in the squad, we all want to fight for that starting place, so let's see. We're all looking forward to next season.

'I want to try my best and I'm going to give it a proper go to play well, so the first thing I have to do is look after myself to make sure I'm in good shape and a good frame of mind.'

The Finn stressed the importance of making a strong start to next season in order to avoid concerns over relegation.

'Last season was a bit disappointing as in the early part things didn't really work out because we didn't really score enough goals and then we got injury problems.

'If you look at it, we finished 13th, having had a difficult season, so it's not the end of the world. We have to make sure we're ready for this coming season.

'In our first season back in the Premier League, we started well, but last season we didn't get those points on the board early on and that's what created the pressure and all the injuries just made it worse.

'We have to make sure we're ready for this coming season so we can start well.'
