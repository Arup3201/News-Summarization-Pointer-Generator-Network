A woman and a dog recently had the good fortune to find each other at a Nebraska animal shelter, not only because they both needed companions, but also because they're both deaf.

Cindy Koch had been looking for a pet that shared her condition and employees at the Central Nebraska Humane Society wanted the pit bull mix they'd fallen in love with to find the same thing.

When Rosie and Cindy met this month, everyone was a winner. But it took some time for shelter employees to figure out just what they were dealing with in the 3-year-old rescue.

Now Rosie is going home with what shelter workers is the perfect family.

'It's what I hoped would eventually happen and it, she couldn't have gone to a nicer family,' Tracie Pfeifle of the Humane Society told KCTV.

Cindy Koch was experiencing some of those same feelings as she came to take Rosie home.

'I'm going to teach her my sign language, how deaf people communicate, she's a smart dog, she can pick up fast,' said Koch as she sat with her family, Rosie's head in her lap.

Koch said she'd always wanted a deaf dog and jumped at the chance to adopt Rosie when she heard she'd spent three months at the Grand Island, Nebraska shelter and needed a home.

Mystery soon solved: 3-year-old Rosie did not respond to workers when she first arrived to the Central Nebraska Humane Society, but they soon understood why

The emotional day, which was bittersweet for shelter workers who'd grown to love Rosie, Koch and Pfeifle even hugged and vowed to stay in touch before the pooch drove away as the newest member of the Koch family.

Months earlier, Rosie was in a more precarious position. She was around people who cared when she arrived at the shelter, but they couldn't figure out why she wouldn't respond to them.

As soon as they ascertained the cause, Pfeifle and company started teaching Rosie simple signs, armed only with treats and a guide to American Sign Language.

'It was just amazing to watch her just blossom into a dog, I don't think she knew how to be a dog,' Pfeifle said.

Touching: Koch plans to teach the dog some of her own signs so the two of them can communicate in a way they each best understands
