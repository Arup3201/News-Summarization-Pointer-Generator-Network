Most people would not let a spider within a metre of them but a brave young woman has voluntarily let a massive huntsman crawl all over her body.

Julia Sotoul was in Yeppoon on the central coast of Queensland when the eight-legged creature took a liking to her.

In footage of the incident guaranteed to make anyone's skin crawl, a friend of Ms Sotoul's is seen coaxing the arachnid onto his hand before he places it on her.

She let the spider crawl up her arm, onto her neck and rested on top of her head

Ms Sotoul remains surprisingly calm as the spider scurries up her arm from her hand.

It then makes its way over her right shoulder and up her neck before resting on her head.

The spider takes in the view from the top of Ms Sotoul's head, but it seems she has had enough, asking where the creature was on her body.

Her friend then takes it off her head, but it was not going without a fight.

The massive spider took a liking to her. Ms Sotoul found the creature climbing on her foot while on a tin roof

'He likes you,' the friend is heard saying before it finally gives in and wanders into his waiting hand before he drops it.

When it is gone, Ms Sotoul shudders and then lets out a yelp.

Of the 'new experience', she said she was happy to have crossed it off her list.

'I was not very confident. I'm still feeling it on me,' Ms Sotoul told friends on her Facebook page.

Ms Sotoul said she could still feel the spider crawling on her days later
