Labour MP Jim Sheridan questioned why 'parasitical' journalists are allowed to report from Parliament

Labour MP Jim Sheridan today launched an extraordinary attack on the media, demanding to know why the ‘parasitical elements of the Press’ are allowed into Parliament.

The remarks came as MPs grilled media campaigners Hacked Off, including Max Mosley who warned that if newspapers refuse to sign up to a new regulator Parliament should intervene.

The Commons Culture committee was taking evidence after the three main political parties reached a deal on a Royal Charter to create a powerful new watchdog to regulate the Press.

Mr Sheridan, a member of the committee, voiced concerns ‘parasitical elements of press’.

He said: 'What concerns me is the parasitical elements within the press who abuse their position in here (Parliament) in terms of hiding behind their pen and calling people names,’ he said in comments apparently aimed at some parliamentary sketch writers.

‘That's the so-called brave people. I don't understand why they are allowed to come into this place and behave in the way that they do.’ He also accused reporters of ‘hiding behind their pens’.

It raises the extraordinary prospect of journalists being banned from reporting from within Parliament, which has been allowed since 1771.

Instead of attacking the Press, Mr Sheridan was supposed to be holding to account Hacked Off, the campaign group which has pushed for tougher regulation of the Press.

Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘laughable’ for Hacked Off to pose as champions of a free press.

Mr Davies, one of 14 Conservative MPs who rebelled last night over a Commons amendment enabling the courts to impose exemplary damages on newspapers which do not sign up to the new regulator, said: ‘You are not here to represent a free press.

‘You're here to represent people who on the one hand court publicity for all it's worth if there's a financial return for them but don't like the negative publicity that sometimes goes with it.

‘You're here representing the Hugh Grants of the world. You are not here representing the free press of the world.’

Former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley told MPs claimed the new press regulator plan was a 'win-win' for the industry

Jim Sheridan, Labour MP for Paisley & Renfrewshire North is a former shipyard worker who also worked as a newspaper printer for the Paisley Daily Express before getting into politics through the traditional trade union route with the TGWU.

He came under fire during the expenses scandal when it was revealed he used his allowances to reclaim the cost of a 42-inch plasma TV, leather bed and hundreds of pounds worth of furniture.

The Daily Telegraph revealed that in 2005/06 financial year, he used his second homes allowance to pay a £991.95 bill for a Memory foam mattress and 'ivory leather bed'. A further £500 spent on furniture and household accessories that year was also claimed on his expenses.

Between January and April 2006, he reclaimed £699 for a three-seater sofa, £829 for a two-seater sofa bed, £219 for a coffee table and £199 for a lamp table.

Asked about his expense claims, he said his constituency was too far from London to commute.

He lives in Erskine, Renfrewshire with his wife Jean. They have a son and daughter.

But his comments were rejected by Prof Brian Cathcart from Hacked Off who accused some newspapers of trying to distort the Leveson recommendations in an attempt to undermine them.

He said: ‘I think that a great deal of the response to this debate - the whole Leveson inquiry - has been hysterical and some of it has involved an abuse of the power of the press.

‘The distortion in the reporting of the Leveson inquiry as it progressed was pretty shocking. The distortion in the reporting of the report when it appeared was extraordinary.’

Former Formula 1 boss Mr Mosley claimed the new system would ‘change the climate completely, and actually in the interests of the press’.

He added: ‘Because when they finally make their minds up, which I’m sure they will, that’s its more economical to be part of the regulator, they will save vast amounts in legal costs themselves.

‘It seems to me win-win. They’ve got themselves into a frame of mind where anything remotely legal is somehow a threat to their freedom, which is simply not the case.’

He warned that if the industry does not sign up to the scheme, Parliament should intervene.

Hugh Tomlinson QC, a leading member of the group, said the newspapers had had the chance to make their case to the Leveson inquiry and should now accept its findings.

Giving evidence to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Hacked Off director Brian Cathcart accused some newspapers of an ‘abuse’ of their power in an attempt to protect their own position.

Last night some of the biggest 
national newspaper publishers warned there were a number of ‘deeply 
contentious issues’ surrounding plans agreed by the three main political
parties for a new regulator established by royal charter.

However
Mr Tomlinson, who was one of four Hacked Off representatives present at
the late night talks where the deal was hammered out, said newspapers 
were not entitled to a fresh chance to influence ministers.

The Prime Minister, pictured leaving Number 10 ahead of his statement, hailed the deal which would secure upfront apologies and million-pound fines

Recommendation: Lord Justice Leveson called for a new Press regulator underpinned by statute

He said: ‘We don't think they are entitled to lobby.

‘There was a public inquiry where they were represented by a total of eight or 10 different QCs who argued their case, they have brought their evidence, the judge considered it, the judge came to his conclusion.

‘We think that the press shouldn't have a second bite of the cherry trying to lobby ministers again with arguments that failed in front of the public inquiry. We continue to think that those recommendations ought to be implemented.’
