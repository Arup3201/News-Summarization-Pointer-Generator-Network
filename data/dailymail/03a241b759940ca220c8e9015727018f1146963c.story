A former lifeguard is ‘probably responsible’ for killing April Jones, a court heard yesterday.

Nevertheless, Mark Bridger, 47, denies abducting and murdering the five-year-old, whose disappearance in Machynlleth, mid Wales, last October, triggered a huge search.

A statement by defence barrister Brendan Kelly QC that the accused was not guilty of murder, but that he accepted that he was probably responsible for her death, could be reported, a judge at a plea hearing said yesterday.

'Probably responsible': Mark Bridger, 46, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of April Jones. The former lifeguard is pictured right leaving Mold Crown Court yesterday

Mr Justice Griffith-Williams told 
Mold Crown Court: ‘The defendant’s case is that he was probably 
responsible for the death of April.’

April’s mother, Coral Smith, 40, sat less than 10ft from the defendant.

She dabbed her eyes with a tissue 
during the hearing and her hands shook as she stared intently at 
Bridger, a former neighbour, who is the uncle of April’s two 
half-sisters.

She had arrived in court dressed in 
pink, April’s favourite colour, with her husband, Paul Jones, 43, who 
has two daughters from a previous relationship with the sister of 
Bridger’s former girlfriend.

Coral and Paul Jones, both dressed in pink, leave court yesterday morning after a hearing in which they heard Bridger was 'possibly responsible' for their daughter's death

Mrs Smith wore a pink top and Mr 
Jones wore a pink shirt and a small pink ribbon, the symbol used by 
their community in the past few months to symbolise the search for 
April.

It was the first time April’s parents had faced Bridger since he was arrested on the afternoon after she disappeared.

Bridger, who appeared with close cut 
hair and a goatee beard, seemed to try to compose himself before staring
straight ahead as he pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnap, murder 
and perverting the course of justice through the disposal of April’s 
body.

April's family today thanked the public for their support as they issued a new picture of the little girl.

Hours after the hearing, Coral and Paul wrote on Facebook : 'Thanks to everyone for their messages and support it means a lot to our family.'

The girl was last seen playing with 
friends on her bike about 100 yards from her home on the Bryn-y-Gog 
estate in Machynlleth on the evening of October 1 last year.

A huge police manhunt began almost 
immediately after the alarm was raised that night but the girl, who had 
cerebral palsy, has still yet to be found.

The search has covered the rugged 
terrain in the countryside surrounding her home town and the depths of 
the fast-flowing Dyfi river.

The spiralling cost of the continued hunt for April is likely to be as much as £2.4million.

On Sunday, April’s family released a 
photograph of her playing on the bike she would have been cycling on the
night she disappeared.

She had been allowed to play late in the evening as a treat for a glowing school report.

On New Year’s Eve, Mrs Smith wrote of her huge sense of loss in a heartbreaking Facebook update.

The post read: ‘April you should be 
home. I can’t stop crying today, I’ve been doing some house work and 
I’ve come across some of April’s things and pictures.

‘I love you so much April – please if you are that person out there who knows please come forward.’

Her mother also made a desperate plea for 
her return in time for family birthdays this month.

She wrote on 
Facebook previously : 'Make my birthday wish come true. I love you so 
much, come home so my heart can be fixed. I miss you like hell.'

She revealed that April's Christmas present was at home still waiting for her.

Bridger, a father of four from 
Ceinws, near Machynlleth, was arrested the day after April went missing 
and was charged four days later.

The former lifeguard, who has also 
worked in an abbatoir and as a mechanic, was yesterday remanded in 
custody at Strangeways prison in Manchester.

He now faces a four-week trial at Mold Crown Court, which is due to begin on February 25.
