With Australia's strict asylum seeker policy putting an effective stop to boat arrivals, Indonesian people smugglers have set their sights on another 'safe haven'.

More than 8,000 kilometres away, beyond the treacherous waters of the Indian Ocean and the fickle Tasman Sea, lies New Zealand, a country whose shores have so far remained untouched by any refugee boat.

Various separate plans to attempt the journey have so far been thwarted, with some never making it past Papua New Guinea while others collapse at the early planning stages, still in Indonesia.

New Zealand is the the new ideal location for the approximate 100,000 refugees currently in limbo in Indonesia, after crackdowns in Australia render seeking asylum in the closer country impossible

But a joint investigation by Fairfax Media and New Zealand's Sunday Star-Times, has revealed that, as desperation mounts amongst the 100,000 plus asylum seekers currently in Indonesia and with more arriving every day, smugglers continue to try and win over the wallets of those who are frantic to resettle.

Part of the desperation for the 100 or so refugees that arrive each day, is their instant move into limbo, due to Indonesia not being a signatory of the Refugee Convention.

This means they are dubbed illegal and are unable to work or educate their children, leaving them with the option of remaining in Indonesia with a minute chance of resettlement, returning to the home they fled or risk a spell in one of Australia's detention centres.

Feeding off of these anxieties, are people smugglers, who offer the faint hope of a fourth option: New Zealand.

One Pakistani travel agent, who now resides in Bogor, Indonesia, has most recently been one of the culprits behind a ploy to smuggle 50 Indian, Bangladesh, Pakistani and Afghan refugees out of the town of Cisarua and onto a boat bound for West Papua and finally Kaitaia, in New Zealand's north-west, Fairfax reports.

New Zealand's Indonesian Ambassador David Taylor is skeptical about the small refugee boat's ability to successfully make the 8,000km journey from Indonesia, as no refugee boat has ever reached its shores to date

For the price of $500 US up front, and about $5000 US in total, the organisation offered the asylum seekers passage on an metal-hulled, 32m-long and 7m-high boat which he termed 'safe' for the treacherous voyage.

The smugglers also claim a second boat would follow close behind as back up as they travelled along the Indonesian coast, and as far as West Papua where the larger boat would be re-provisioned and the smaller support vessel would return to Java.

They told the passengers that the journey would take 10-12 days, but ensured them that New Zealand would accept the refugees if the boat made it to its destination.

The plan was thwarted however when the refugees were intercepted by police after a suspected tip-off.

The most recent New Zealand bound boat, which planned to follow a route similar to the one pictured, was thwarted by Indonesian officials on Wednesday

New Zealand's Indonesian Ambassador, David Taylor, says the smugglers' grand promises are all dangerous lies.

'The boats these people-smugglers are using are mainly wooden, small, they're not ocean fit and they're overcrowded . . . it's a pipe dream that they're going to be able to get to New Zealand,' he said.

'Some [smugglers] say "we'll get you to New Zealand" not actually intending to get there because they know they can't, [they're] hoping to get to a certain point then duck into Australia, so it's part of their marketing strategy.'

In a tape obtained by The Sunday Star-Times, a money changer said the following about a proposed voyage to New Zealand: 'All passengers are waiting for getting one boat through. If one boat through, proved getting to New Zealand, more will go.'
