Criticism: Sir Andrew, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Poet Laureate for ten years until 2009, called the Government's National Planning Policy Framework a 'charter for builders'

Radical new planning laws are causing ‘irreversible damage’ to the countryside, the former Poet Laureate warned last night.

Sir Andrew Motion called the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework a ‘charter for builders’ which would lead to the loss of priceless countryside.

His comments coincide with the full introduction today of the system – which ministers say will cut red tape and boost development.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles briefed the Cabinet on the changes yesterday, saying they would encourage thousands of projects.

But conservation groups warn councils are not prepared for new rules, leaving valuable land vulnerable to inappropriate development.

Sir Andrew, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Poet Laureate for ten years until 2009, said tearing up planning laws would not solve the housing crisis.

‘I don’t think this Government wants to wreck the countryside, but it is going to do so unless it changes course,’ he said.

‘Today the National Planning Policy Framework comes into full force and it is proving to be groundbreaking in all the wrong ways.

‘Developing greenfield sites unnecessarily and with inadequate local consultation is entirely the wrong way to make sure we get the new homes the country so badly needs.

‘This is a charter for builders and truly irreversible damage is already underway. It is urgent that something is done about it.

The new framework was introduced 12 
months ago, but during a ‘transitional’ period planners have only been 
allowed to give it limited weight when considering appeals.

From today it will be the default planning guidance in local authorities which have not adopted tailored plans setting out where housing and other development should go.

The latest figures show 30 per cent of councils have not published such local plans, while a further 20 per cent are still waiting for approval.

National Trust spokesman James Lloyd said: ‘Half of England has no plans in place . . . Local authorities must be given more time.

‘We are not against development but we want to see development  in the right places. If we want to  regenerate cities and protect our precious green spaces for future  generations to enjoy we must build on brownfield sites first.’

But ministers insist the changes – which slash 1,000 pages of planning guidance to 50 – protect picturesque areas.

A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ‘Very strong protections are in place to safeguard the Green Belt and other important areas.

‘Planning approvals are up but there has been no increase in appeals. Councils should focus on getting up-to-date locally decided plans in place, and seven out of ten already have published plans.’
