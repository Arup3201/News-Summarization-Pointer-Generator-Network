After a successful year Twiggy is back with her first Twiggy for M&S Woman collection of 2013.

Featuring sharp separates such as zipped detail biker jackets and nehru neck blazers, the pieces are sure to see you through spring in style.

Feminine dress shapes and pencil skirts nod to a more feminine take on the spring styling, while cool navy and whites champion the collection with hints of shimmery grey metallic’s for that touch of glamour.

Twiggy’s amazing career in fashion, love of design and unique appeal to M&S’s customers has helped her to create yet another exciting collection for Twiggy for M&S woman - her seventh overall.

Working closely with the M&S design team, Twiggy has created a co-ordinated range of chic, modern, stylish pieces, interpreting the latest catwalk trends as well as using favourite contemporary and timeless key pieces for inspiration.  

Aimed at the woman who loves clothes and fashion, who wants versatile separates that are beautifully cut, in premium fabrics with dedicated attention to detail.

M&S say: 'We want our customers to enjoy being inspired on how to wear the looks and how to create glamorous, modern outfits that are confident and aspirational and who better than Twiggy and M&S to create this signature style.'

Last year the high street retailer 
recruited her to create a womenswear range and due to high demand she 
has unveiled a second collection which included a selection of 
accessories and footwear.

Commenting on the collection Twiggy says: 'I am so excited to continue to develop my relationship with M&S and its customers.

'This brand  has been so inspiring to work on and is designed to have a really broad appeal.

'I have such a passion for design and have worked in the fashion industry for more than four decades and truly believe fashion should be stylish and fun, I hope you can see this sense of joy within the collection'. 

Neil Hendy, M&S Head of Design adds: 'It has been a fantastic experience working with Twiggy, she has a very clear idea about how she wants the collection to look, feel and fit.

'She has an expert eye for detail and uses her experience and knowledge of fashion and M&S customers to make sure every piece appeals'. 

Prices start from £12.50 for a scoop neck T-shirt to £199 for a suede biker jacket, available in sizes 8-24.
