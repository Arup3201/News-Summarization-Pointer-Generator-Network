Shane Butcher isn't broke, divorced or depressed, he just wants to get rid of his entire life so he can start a new one... with the $3.5million he hopes to make from the sale of his former self.

Mr Butcher, 29, has put his three video-game stores, his two Florida homes, his three cars, three kayaks, and a Thomas Kinkade painting up for sale on eBay for $3.5million dollars to whomever wants to live out his 'American Dream.'

He hopes to use the money to travel and start a new life with his wife, as well as start a family back in Florida once they've had their fair share of the world.

'There was no reason for me not to,' Mr Butcher said to Forbes.

He spent his entire life 'investing' in his business, his homes, his world and he's just looking to cash out and start at it all over again.

He insists that he's not trying to unload a sinking business.

'The stores are very profitable,' Mr Butcher told the Baltimore Sun.

'The hard work is getting the business off the ground, that part is already done.'

He has even offered to stay on and help the new owner run the chain for six months and has his employees '110 per cent' committed to a smooth transition.

Steal: Mr Butcher also wants to sell his two-bedroom, 1 1/2 bath town home that overlooks the water in Tampa Bay, located in a luxury waterfront community with three pools, two hot tubs, two gyms and private beaches

'I’m in the black. Everything I have, my home my cars, everything is paid off in full. This isn’t a fire sale, by any means,' he said, to sweeten the pot.

His three cars, a 2009 Honda Accord, 2004 Honda Element and a 2006 Lotus Elise, come with the 'Dream' too.

Pals: He says he's perfectly fine if his American Dream isn't someone else's, but he's looking forward to seeing more of the world

'With $3.5 million, it’s just painless. I can go buy another house. I can go buy things, things are there,' he said.

'The main item for sale is the business itself, the rest I’m throwing in just to throw in.'

He says he's perfectly fine if his American Dream isn't someone else's, but he's looking forward to seeing more of the world.

'There's a lot of things we haven't seen or gotten to do while we've been working so hard to grow the business,' he told the Baltimore Sun.

'We'd like to see the landmarks throughout the country, the Grand Canyon, stuff like that. We'll probably buy a camper and just travel for a while, go see some family.'

But Mr Butcher isn't the first, and probably won't be the last person to turn to eBay to get a second chance.

In 2008, Australian Ian Usher sold his 'life' (including his friends) after a nasty divorce for $305,000.
