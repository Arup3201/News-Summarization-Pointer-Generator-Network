Steven Gerrard says talking about Wayne Rooney's achievements with Manchester United ‘kills him’ but feels the striker fully deserves any records he earns with his country.

The Manchester United captain has enjoyed a trophy-laden career winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time at Old Trafford.

Now the captain of his country, Rooney is expected to earn his 100th cap on Friday when England face Slovenia in a friendly at Wembley and is also currently fourth on the list of England leading scorers with 43 goals, just six behind Sir Bobby Charlton.

And with Rooney closing in on Charlton’s record, Gerrard says the Manchester United star fully deserves to go down in history for his country.

‘I think it would be fully deserved for a player of his calibre and for what he’s done for Manchester United even though it kills me saying it,’ Gerrard told ITV Sport.

‘He’s taken that onto the international stage and he’s been consistent with goals and performances.

‘In years to come anyone who is looking back at records and looks at goals and caps, Wayne Rooney’s name will come up and I think he deserves both accolades.’
