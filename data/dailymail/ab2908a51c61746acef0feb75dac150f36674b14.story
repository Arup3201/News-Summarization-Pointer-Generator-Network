And now it seems people have also taken to dressing their dogs in seasonal attire as these hilarious photos show.

Many owners now buy their dogs Christmas themed sweaters for the festive period – while some take it even further and opt for full fancy dress.

In one photo two terriers in 'Santas's Lil Helper' bodysuits are seen sitting expectantly below a chimney - while one pet owner, Ryan Beauchesne, has taken to dressing his Mini Dachshund, Crusoe, in a Father Christmas outfit.  

Elf and reindeer suits also appear popular choices for festive dog outfits as an increasing number of people get into the habit of involving their beloved pets in Christmas.

Waitrose says 63 per cent of British pet owners will be buying them a present this year.

And it doesn’t stop there. Last year, Sainsbury’s had Christmas turkey dinners for pets for the first time, and sold so many (50,000) that this year it’s increased its range.

Zoe St. John, from website Astar Pets, said: ‘Pets really have become true family members and giving them Christmas presents of new beds, collars or clothes is now just part and parcel of enjoying Christmas with the whole family.

'Customers are spending more and more on their pets. Back in 1957 spending on pets ranked 49th in weekly household expenditure, today it ranks 37th, ahead of cosmetics and UK holidays. 

'And with 90 per cent of customers planning to buy their pet a Christmas present, we expect this trend to continue.'

And Donna Condliffe, from pet product company Canineandco, said: ‘There are a number of reasons why pets benefit from wearing clothing in the colder weather and this can include if a pet is elderly, for health reasons or if a pet is suffering from a skin condition such as Arthritis or Alopecia.

‘Having an item of clothing such as a jumper will help to protect them from the elements and make their lives more comfortable.

‘Also you have breeds who are hairless such as the Chinese Crested Dogs or Sphynx cat - as they have no hair they cannot conserve body heat so need a jumper or a coat to help do this.

‘Also short haired breeds who are used to living indoors with central heating can feel the cold when they go out - this is where a coat or jumper will benefit them.

‘Pet clothing can help comfort a pet - making them feel more secure with a calming sense of closeness.

‘Don't be put off by people who say "How do you know they enjoy it?" - You know your pet better than anyone - you can tell by their reaction, how they behave and their mood as to whether or not it bothers them.

‘If your pet is not fazed and continues to run around, not trying to take it off and is happy - then you know they don't mind it.

Four-legged friends: Christmas jumpers have become a must-have for pets while the more adenturous owners may even opt for a festive tartan dress

‘Dogs have worn clothes for centuries but these days there is more choice and variety and as pets are very much a big part of the family, when the whole family wear their Christmas Jumpers - then they want their dog to join in as well.

‘As long as the correct size is chosen to allow their bodies to breathe and to allow them to move freely, then if the dog is comfortable wearing a jumper then there is no harm taking your dog for a walk in their new festive sweater.

‘Another reason people like our Santa Dog Outfits - is when they have a Therapy Dog - when the dog visits the elderly or sick, dressed up as Santa Paws - then it puts a big smile on their face - which has to be a good thing.’
