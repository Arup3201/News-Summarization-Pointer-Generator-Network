Tragic: David Bogenberger, 19, pictured was found dead at an NIU frat house on Friday

A Northern Illinois University freshman was found dead in a fraternity house bunk bed on Friday, after a booze-fueled college party.Â 

David Bogenberger, 19, was unresponsive when police arrived at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house at 10.14am and was pronounced dead about half an hour later by DeKalb County Coroner Dennis Miller.

An autopsy performed on Saturday failed to determine why the sports-loving business student died, but toxicology tests should show whether alcohol played a role.

Mr Bogenberger, a triplet, graduated from Palatine High School in June. His father, Gary Bogenberger, said his son lived in a campus dormitory but was pledging the fraternity.

He told the Daily Chronicle he found it 'tragic' that his son died alone.

'I am so surprised at the number of comments and well-wishes on his Facebook page from so many of his friends,' he said.

'He was such a nice kid that everyone liked. I just video-chatted with him Wednesday night, and he seemed so happy, doing great in his classes and looking so forward to life.

'It's tragic that he died alone.'

David's mother, Ruth Bogenberger, added that the family was 'shocked and distraught' by Mr Bogenberger's mystery death.

His sister, Megan, changed her Facebook profile to a photograph of her and David on Friday, with the caption, 'you were the best brother a girl could ask for.'

Condolences from friends and family members flooded in over the weekend, with Andrew Sutter writing: 'Megan and alex im sry (sic) for ur loss dave was a great guy, he knew how to make everyone laugh its a tragedy to say that he is gone i pay u my respectes (sic) and once again im sry for ur loss.'

DeKalb Police Lt. Jason Leverton said there were no obvious signs of foul play and no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Bogenberger's death.

Officers found evidence of alcohol use near Mr Bogenberger's body, and they know he was one of several students invited to the fraternity house on Thursday night.

But they won't know whether binge-drinking or some form of fraternity initiation was responsible until toxicology samples are returned, which could take up to two weeks.

Lt. Leverton said they wanted
to interview more than 20 people who had been at the fraternity house 
around that time to help piece together what happened.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with David's family and friends as they cope with this difficult loss,' NIU President John Peters said. 'Please know that your grief is shared collectively by the NIU community.'

The university is offering counselling and support to help students deal with the freshman's death.

President of the NIU Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, Alexander Jandick, said the chapter has ceased operations and was fully cooperating with the police investigation.

According to his student webpage, Mr Bogenberger enjoyed watching classic films, reading and playing sports with his friends.

He was involved heavily in activities at Palatine High School, and worked as a waiter and cook at Panera Bread Co. over the past two years.

Mr Bogenberger also volunteered throughout his community and served as a classroom assistant for his local church, where a celebration of life will be held tomorrow.

Flowers and lanterns were left outside the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity home over the weekend, serving as a memorial for the popular student.
