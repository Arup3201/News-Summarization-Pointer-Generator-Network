Sam Mason, 45, the ex-wife of murdered British gold dealer Andrew Bush, called his former lover an 'evil murderous monster' adding that she can 'rot in Hell'

The ex-wife of a millionaire businessman shot dead in Spain has branded his accused killer an 'evil monster' saying she should 'rot in Hell'.

Andy Bush, 48, was allegedly shot dead by 23-year-old ex-girlfriend Mayka Kukucova shortly after arriving at his villa in Estapona last Saturday.

His ex-wife Sam Mason, 45, attacked Kukucova in a Facebook message today, as a judge ruled Mr Bush's body must stay in Spain.

Ms Mason is in the country with daughter Ellie Bush, 19, who flew over to help with repatriation arrangements. They were initially told they could bring him back within a fortnight.

But they now face a painful and potentially lengthy wait after a judge made the ruling.

Radio presenter Sam, who split from Bristol-based jeweller Mr Bush six years ago: 'We’re obviously devastated.

'They haven’t given us a specific reason. It’s supposed to be for several reasons but we haven’t been given any guidance whatsoever “We’ll be looking into it during the week.

'We were told we could bring him back home in two weeks time. We thought we would come back home and make some preparations and go back out and get him or meet him where he was going to be repatriated to.

'Then we had another phone call the next day saying unfortunately you can’t repatriate him now.

'We feel as if we’re in a state of total limbo.'

On the same day the decision was made, Ms Mason, posted a message online which 
read: 'She is an evil murderous monster and it will ALL come out at the 
trial.

Kukucova is currently being held in her native Slovakia after handing herself over to police following a manhunt

'She has taken my baby's daddy away from her forever. I hope she rots in Hell.'

She added: 'Got my baby (Ellie) home at last. Next stage is bringing her daddy home. It's so complicated.'

British Embassy officials were last night trying to put pressure on Spanish authorities to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

The fact Mr Bush was the victim of a crime - and his alleged killer may demand a new post-mortem after she is extradited to Spain - is thought to be part of the reason for the repatriation hold-up.

The family of a British father set upon by a gang of men outside a bar in Competa near Malaga in June 2009 told late last year how they had to wait for six months for the repatriation of his body.

According to Miss Korotaeva, Kukucova lay in wait at Mr Bush's Costa del Sol villa before shooting him dead as the couple arrived home

Miss Korotaeva has branded Kukucova 'madly jealous' and said the 'uneducated' model shot Mr Bush before fleeing almost 2,000 in his Hummer 4x4

Scot Stephen Mallon’s family were told he must be preserved in case of another post-mortem and his body was placed in a mortuary in Bournemouth where they live pending a trial which has yet to take place in Malaga.

Mr Mallon’s daughter Jenny, a St Andrews University student, told a paper last November: 'We never imagined he would still be there three years on.'

Part-time model Miss Kukucova, is being held in custody in Slovakia after managing to flee Spain in the wake of her former lover’s death despite an international manhunt.

Miss Korotaeva claims Kukucova shot Mr Bush in a jealous rage, but Slovak is reportedly pleading self-defence

Mr Bush and Miss Korotaeva had been dating for five months and had been in Spain to celebrate their anniversary

She has been accused of killing him in revenge at being dumped late last year but is reportedly claiming she acted in self-defence. 

A court in her homeland is expected to approve her extradition to Spain within the next month.

Mr Bush’s family has painted a disturbing picture of an irrational woman whose jealous rages destroyed her relationship with the multi-millionaire jeweller.

Daughter Ellie told yesterday that she would throw tantrums in his Bristol shops, check computers he had used and go through his phone.
