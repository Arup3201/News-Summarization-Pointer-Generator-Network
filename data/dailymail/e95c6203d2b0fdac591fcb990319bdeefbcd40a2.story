They were once the epitome of the swinging sixties, a wild-living rock 'n' roll band followed around the world by flocks of adoring groupies.

But despite still playing to sell-out crowds, it seems the Rolling Stones' backstage habits have mellowed with their age.

Now old enough to be claiming their pensions, guitarist Ronnie Wood has revealed the band spend most of their free time playing backgammon and watching murder mysteries.

The band recently resumed their sell-out world tour, playing to packed stadiums in Denmark and Sweden.

But anyone who thought that the band had returned to their party-loving ways now that they are back on stage would be mistaken.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph today, Wood said the band are often left tired by the amount of travelling they do and now spend much of their time watching TV together.

He said: 'We watch 19 murder mysteries in a row. We're on Above Suspicion at the moment... Even with Jagger I go, "Let's go and watch House of Cards".'

The 67-year-old said the band got so hooked on one series while in China, they had to send a runner out at 4am to track down the next box-set.

After becoming addicted to US series Breaking Bad, the band were met backstage by Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman in the hit show.

Wood told the paper he is also into jigsaw puzzles because they are 'good for the brain' and his wife, Sally Humphreys, 36, recently organised a backgammon tournament for band members.

Wood has been sober since emerging from rehab in 2010 and he and his wife now have a completely alcohol-free fridge, he said.

The couple met more than a decade ago when Wood was still married to ex-wife, Jo. But following his divorce and a string of rumoured younger partners, they got together in 2011 and married the following year.

The Stones recently wrapped up the 14-show Scandinavian leg of their world tour, where they played to a total of more than 780,000 fans.

Despite the foursome, made up of Wood, Jagger, Charlie Watts and Keith Richards, having a combined age of 280, they joked to the crowd in Roskilde: 'This band is really picking up steam now'.

They are now due to play a nine-show tour of Australia and New Zealand starting October 25 and finishing November 22.

The tour was postponed in March to allow Jagger time to mourn the death of his partner L'Wren Scott, who committed suicide in New York in March, aged 49.

Wood's interview was published after Jagger spoke for the first time about his 'very hard' time since her death.

He told the Today show in the US: 'I'm doing OK. It was difficult, you know, very hard year, but I got back into it by working on touring with the [Rolling] Stones in Europe, and doing other things.'
