A state trooper has been suspended after pointing a gun at a teenager when he pulled over her car at a traffic stop.

Timothy Wagner, of Michigan State Police, drew the weapon at the 18-year-old near Sturgis after he clocked her red Pontiac doing 77 mph in a 55 mph zone.

After being handcuffed and taken into the trooper's car, she told him she was speeding after receiving a call that her family home had been broken into.

The pictures came from the trooper's dashboard camera during the incident near Sturgis in Michigan

But despite confirming that was in fact the case, Mr Wagner then asks her, 'How'd you like having a gun pointed?'

It is then claimed the trooper said to the teenager that she should take it as a learning experience even though he should probably take her to jail as she refused to stop when asked to pull over.

Video from the officer's dashboard camera shows the girl being pulled over before the state trooper approaches her vehicle with his firearm pointed.

It is thought she was on her way home from baseball practice and was still wearing her training kit at the time of the incident.

The girl is then handcuffed and taken into Mr Wagner's car where she apologises for going fast but says her home is being broken into.

However, he asks her, 'How'd you like having a gun pointed' before the rest of the conversation become inaudible.

The incident was investigated by the local St Joseph County Prosecutor, but they decided it did not warrant any criminal charges.

However, prosecutor John McDonough says he was 'appalled and disgusted' by the incident.

An internal investigation is also being carried out by the Michigan State Police and Mr Wagner is suspended with pay pending the results of the probe.

The investigation was prompted after the teenage girl's parents complained about the incident.

Her father says she was crying when she arrived home and told him that a gun had been pointed at her. 

The 18-year-old then walks back to her vehicle. Her parents then complained about the trooper's conduct

However, in a written statement by Mr Wagner to Detective 1st Lieutenant Chuck Christensen, obtained by the Kalamazoo Gazette, the state trooper says the fatal shooting of a fellow colleague was playing on his mind.

Trooper Paul Butterfield was shot dead during a routine traffic stop in Mason County last year.

The paper reports Mr Wagner as saying: 'With the recent incident involving the murder of Trooper Paul Butterfield while approaching a vehicle at the forefront of my mind I elected to 'clear' the vehicle for my safety as I feel the vehicle could have suddenly pulled to the side in an effort to lure me into a vulnerable position where I could easily be shot.'
