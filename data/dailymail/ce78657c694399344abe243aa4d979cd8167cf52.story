A veterans group has claimed to have uncovered potentially significant information about the accused killer of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle.

The Warfighter Foundation alleged that Eddie Ray Routh, 27, the Marine veteran accused of murdering Navy SEAL Kyle two years ago, never saw combat nor experienced traumatic situations during his time serving overseas,TheBlaze reported on Thursday.

As yet, there is no conclusive evidence to back up the claims made by the group.

Routh, whose trial for murder is expected to start next week in Stephenville, Texas, is alleged to have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he shot married father-of-two Kyle, 38, and fellow Navy SEAL and father-of-one Chad Littlefield, 35. 

The incident occurred at a remote shooting range outside of Chalk Mountain, Texas, on February 2, 2013.

Eddie Ray Routh (pictured left during service and right in custody) served in Iraq in 2007 before leaving the Marines in 2010. There are now claims he never experienced traumatic events that would lead to PTSD

The Warfighter Foundation has been reaching out to service personnel and verterans that dealt directly with Routh through its Facebook page as it attempts to gather evidence as to whether Routh had PTSD

Kyle, who wrote the book 'American Sniper' and is played in the movie of the same name by Bradley Cooper, had been contacted by Routh's mother to help her son deal with his PTSD.

The trip to the shooting range for target practice had been a part of that service.

Routh served as a small arms technician in Iraq before leaving the Marines in 2010.

The Warfighter Foundation, a nonprofit with the stated goal of empowering combat veterans and their families, is gathering evidence as to whether Routh ever suffered from PTSD in the first place, citing a lack of exposure to traumatic situations.

'Basically, we are trying to conclude what led up over the course of [Routh's] military service that led to February 2, 2013. None of us believe it was PTSD,' Spencer Walker, board president of the Warfighter Foundation and Marine combat veteran, told TheBlaze.

The Warfighter Foundation has been reaching out to service personnel and veterans that dealt directly with Routh through its Facebook page.

In an earlier Facebook post dated January 25, the veterans group laid out what they claim to have uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act concerning Routh's service. The full text reads:

The Warfighter Foundation laid out on their Facebook page what they claim to have uncovered following an examination of Routh's service record. As yet there is no conclusive evidence to support their claims

'Eddie Routh served one tour in Iraq in 2007, at Balad Air Base (the 2nd largest U.S. installation in Iraq), with no significant events. No combat experience. Let me say that again, he NEVER SAW COMBAT or any aspect of traumatic events associated with a combat deployment (i.e. incoming mortar or rocket fire). He never left the base, EVER.

'He held a non-combat arms occupation of 2111 (Small Arms Repairer/ Technician or more commonly referred to as an Armorer). Balad Air Base had a Pizza Hut, 24 hour Buger King, Subway, Popeye's, Baskin Robbins, movie theater, and even a miniature golf course. It even had a strictly enforced 10-mile per hour speed limit! What a dangerous place...

'His tour was comparable to being on a base in southern California, only with MANY more luxuries that were catered to the morale and welfare of the troops who occupied it. He was known to be a drug user and a below average performer while in the Marine Corps.

'This has NOTHING to do with PTSD. He was an individual with psychological problems that were not associated with his service. So don't give me that bleeding heart bulls**** that he was a veteran suffering from PTSD.'

Routh is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity when the trial begins next week. He is accused of killing married father-of-two Kyle, 38 (left), and father-of-one Littlefield, 35 (right)

The post ends with the words: 'He was a piece of s***, end of story.' 

Opening statements in the trial are expected on Wednesday, February 11. Routh is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Routh's attorney has said that the popularity of both the movie 'American Sniper' and Kyle's memoir of the same name, will be an issue when it comes to jury selection.

The book and movie cover Kyle's four tours in Iraq before retiring from the military in 2009. He is recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history.

The movie, which has been nominated for six Academy Awards, broke box office records in January. It does not depict Kyle's death.
