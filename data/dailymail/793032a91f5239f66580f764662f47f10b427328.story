Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has urged FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to take the threat of the Ebola virus seriously with the Africa Cup of Nations just three months away.

The spread of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people across west Africa, has put the tournament  in doubt, with the host nation Morocco requesting the finals be moved or postponed.

CAF refused the request and a series of qualifiers took place across the continent over the past week, with Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring twice in Gabon's 2-0 win over Burkina Faso last Saturday.

Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp is adamant that the Ebola virus outbreak must be taken seriously

Klopp, though, insists that the priority must be people's safety, and not whether football matches go ahead.  

'I don't know whether the players think about it [Ebola], but I think a lot about it,' the Dortmund boss was quoted as saying on Goal.com.

'I spoke a lot with 'Auba' [Aubameyang] about it, tried to sensitise him of the problem as he was away with his national team.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored against Arsenal last month, played for Gabon in Libreville on Saturday 

Klopp said he  spoke in depth to the striker about the threat of the Ebola outbreak before he flew to Africa

'Young people are green; they don't think that much about such things.

'I don't really understand how FIFA or whoever is responsible for that can assume that of all things the borders in Africa are safe enough that no Ebola-infected person can travel to another country. Even here [in Europe], we aren't able to do that.

'If there is one country in Africa which has the feeling that it can't host the Cup safely then this has to be the priority, not the tournament.

'You have to take this seriously and can't shut your eyes. There will be a lot people from all over Africa in Morocco to watch the games and only a few of them would have undergone the best medical checks.'
