British youngsters Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady moved to within one match of qualifying for the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time when they made the third round of the Australian Open qualifying event on Thursday.

On a chill and grey early evening Edmund, the 20-year-old from Yorkshire came back to beat American lefthander Austin Krajicek 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 and now has a winnable encounter against world No 323 Dane Propoggia of Australia.

The fast improving Broady fought out an excellent 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 victory against another American, teenager Jared Donaldson, a superb ballstriker reckoned to be one of the sport's hottest prospects.

It was a match of supremely high quality for the qualifying event on the most remote outside court, and his reward is to face  36-year-old American Michael Russell, the world No 156. Both Broady and Edmund will play their final qualifiers on Saturday.

Although it was only an exhibition status match, British No 2 James Ward earlier registered an encouraging win when he defeated world No 21 John Isner 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 at the Kooyong Classic.

With the American No 1 keen to hone his game ahead of the Australian Open it was still a good result for Ward, who will be in the hat for the main draw that takes place around midnight UK time on Thursday.

'I was pleased with how that went and keen to get a look at his serve ahead of our Davis Cup tie against America in March,' said the 28-year-old Londoner, who has been training with Andy Murray in the off season.
