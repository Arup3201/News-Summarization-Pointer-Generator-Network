A former special constable who went on the run after his conviction for abusing children in the UK has been caught in Cambodia paying young boys as little as 8p for sexual favours.

Paedophile Ian Bower, who fled the country in 2006 while he was still on licence, was jailed for two years and is to be deported back to the UK at the end of his sentence.

Bower, who is a wanted man in the UK, will face the British authorities upon his return.

The former special constable, 46, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, was arrested in Cambodia in November last year following allegations that he targeted five boys aged between 11 and 15.

He had driven his dirt bike to a pagoda compound, a public area in which a Buddhist monk lives, when it was quiet, Phnom Penh Municipal Court hear.

He then played movies and cartoons on his mobile phone to attract the boys and then took the opportunity to molest them.

The paedophile paid the boys between 500 and 10,000 Cambodian Riel - which is equivalent to between 8p and £1.55.

How the news of Bower's latest conviction was reported on in the Cambodian press

Bower was first convicted and 
sentenced in 2004 for three years and nine months at Derby Crown Court 
for sex offences against a boy and downloading indecent images of 
children.

He was released 
from prison on licence in January 2006 on the condition he lived at 
Burdett Lodge bail hostel in Bass Street, Derby. He went missing in 
February 2006.

Children’s rights organisation ECPAT UK 
first alerted British authorities that Bower was in Cambodia in 2007, 
after he was arrested for abusing two brothers, aged 12 and 14, while in
the country teaching English.

The case against him was dropped after the boys withdrew their statements. Because the UK does not have an extradition agreement with Cambodia, he was able to remain in the country.

Christine Beddoe, director of the campaigning organisation, said: 'We are appalled by the inaction of the UK Government who failed to negotiate a diplomatic arrangement to request Cambodian authorities to deport Bower.

'Innocent children were abused because the UK was unable or unwilling to seek the removal of Bower from Cambodia.

'Bower is a wanted and dangerous criminal in the UK, he now should serve his sentence in Cambodia and face the full power of the British courts when he returns.'

He was convicted after a trial and on Monday was jailed for two years. He was fined 1,000 dollars and ordered to pay each of the victims 500 dollars.

Following the hearing, Bower’s lawyer, Dun Vibol, said his client did not accept the verdict and was appealing.

Mr Vibol said: 'He claims he is innocent. In my opinion, the sentence is acceptable but the compensation is too much.'

A Home Office spokeswoman said the Government department did not 'routinely comment on individual cases'.

She said there was no formal extradition treaty, though this did not necessary rule out a UK extradition request being made.
