A man admitted to trying to sell a house near Hyde Park for £1million from under its owner's nose.

Benjamin Khoury, 26, attempted to sell the property on Clarendon Mews, in Bayswater, west London in November last year despite having no legal right to the home.

Khoury, who wore a black suit and white open-necked shirt in the dock at Southwark Crown Court, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.

Co-accused Tamara Pacskowska, 56, and Monika Brzezinska, 28, both deny the charge.

The Polish nationals further deny charges of possessing false ID documents used to enable the sale of the home.

Brzezinska and Pacskowska are both accused of possessing a false passport and false driving license and will face trial later this year.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'The fraud is that the defendants adopted the identity of a lawful owner of a residential property and in support of that offence had created false identity documents with a view to selling the property for about £1million.

'He added: 'It is quite clear on the evidence that Mr Khoury was present at the final and key meeting at the solicitors who were holding the conveyance and was arrested in situ with the co-defendants.'

Brzezinska and Pacskowska, both of  Croydon, were released on bail ahead of their three-day trial which is pencilled in for the week of 27 April.

Khoury, of Hackney, northeast London, was released on bail and will return to Southwark Crown Court at the conclusion of the trial to be sentenced.
