Barcelona forward Neymar, Tottenham hot shot Harry Kane and Chelsea playmaker Oscar were among the sport stars to show their romantic side on Valentine's Day.

Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Patrick Kluivert, Fernandinho and Caroline Wozniacki also were in the mood for love on Saturday.

Barcelona star Neymar posted a special message to his 12 'girlfriends'

Neymar has been prolific for club and country this season and the Brazilian star wanted to spread the love by professing his affection for 12 'girlfriends' on an Instagram video.

Neymar bought a dozen red roses and simply dedicated one to each female on Valentine's Day. 

 

 

 

Caroline Wozniacki posted a picture of herself posing with some chocolate covered strawberries on her Instagram account.

Wozinacki split up with ex-fiance Rory McIlroy in May last year, but clearly the World No 5 has not given up on love and is thought to be in a new relationship with NFL star Ryan Kerrigan. 

She was spotted with Kerrigan, attending a Sports Illustrated Event earlier this week, after appearing on the front of the magazine's swimsuit edition.

Wozniacki is in Dubai at the moment, ahead of the Dubai Duty Free Champioships, which runs from February 15-21. 

The 24-year-old won the same tournament in 2011, beating Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final.  

Seeded fourth for this year's campaign, Wozniacki will have to be at her best to lift the crown again.
