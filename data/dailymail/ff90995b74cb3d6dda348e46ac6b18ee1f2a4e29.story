For most kids having a magician do some tricks, perhaps a clown make everyone laugh or even an outdoor pool party is enough to celebrate their birthday.

However, children in Oklahoma are sharing their special day with aligators at a special pool party.

The idea was dreamed up by staff at the Safari's Sanctuary in Broken Arrow, as part of their Zoo To You scheme.

Children are allowed to play with the animals as part of the Zoo To You program which sees the exotic creatures brought into people's homes

The zoo has come in for some criticism because the animals mouth is taped shut and they are dragged around by children on a leash

As part of the plan, the charity aims to teach children about some of the animals in the zoo, but it does so by bringing some of its most dangerous creatures including alligators.

'Our Zoo 2 You program is a great venue to talk to people about why we rescue, what these animals need to survive, costs, housing and climate needs.... while showing youngsters,' said a spokesperson at the zoo.

Safari's Sanctuary says: 'The animals have always been in captivity, and don't know how to hunt for food. Plus, their mouths are taped shut.'

'They're banded; they have no strength,' Safari Sanctuary Lori Ensign-Scroggins told News 9. 'They weren't blessed with strength in opening, just in clamping down.'

Although the pool parties are supervised, the idea has angered and caused concern for many

Lori Ensign-Scroggins from the zoo said the practice is safe for kids and beasts, but the Wildlife Department said the American Alligator should not be transported

Some of the favorites are an American alligator and a South American Caiman, especially since kids get to swim with them

The pool parties help to raise money for the zoo which is a charity

They're also rinsed and bathed before and after an event. The water is also tested to make sure it's not over chlorinated or harmful to the animal.

'We always have one staff member tending to every animal,' she said.

Despite the zoo's best intentions, the response has been met with anger and concern from worried parents and animal lovers.

'I think you should have a certain responsibility to give these animals a lifestyle that is as close to natural as possible and this doesn't seem like that. They should be in a sanctuary not a swimming pool with their mouths taped shut,' said Laura Gann-Hodd of Morris, OKlahoma.

Misty Richardson of Tulsa also had similar thoughts: ' I thought what these people were doing for these animals was awesome. Now after seeing this, they are just exploiting these animals. Taping their mouths shut to swim with kids is nothing short of animal cruelty. I hope all those animals get moved to a real sanctuary with people who'll only have the animals best interests at heart.'

Others have sprung to the zoos defence saying that children enjoy the experience which is made safe by the zoo's volunteers.

While animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits, can take other animals off the property where they're permitted

The zoo says that Zoo 2 you is the charity's fun, educational way to bring some animals to children's birthday parties allowing them to interact and play while educating on the real needs of the animals

Once the party is over, the animals are returned to the Safari Sanctuary in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma

In addition to rescuing all kinds of exotic animals, Safari's Sanctuary also takes animals on the road

The Safari Santuary say that as a charity and animal rescue center they constantly need funding.

The alligator pool parties are simply are creative way of pulling in much needed cash to the organisation which houses more than 200 animals - many of which would have been destroyed were it not for the zoo's intervention.

Owner Lori Ensign-Scroggins said they have reptiles, birds, tortoise and baby donkeys but the favorites are an American alligator and a South American Caiman, especially since kids get to swim with them.

'It's an awesome experience,' Ms Ensign-Scroggins said. 'The kids have the goggles on and end up floating underneath it, touching it, the kids will swim the way the gators swim and try to race it across the pool.'

Animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits are allowed to take animals off the property where they're permitted but the rules are less clear about moving American alligators from one location to another.
