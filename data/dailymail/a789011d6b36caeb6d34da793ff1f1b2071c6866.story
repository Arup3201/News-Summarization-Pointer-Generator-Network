Daisy the dog is a pet her owner simply can't live without.

That's because the lovable four-year-old has repeatedly saved Judy Owen's life, something she puts down to the pet's 'psychic' powers.

Miss Owen, 60, claims to have avoided serious injury twice after Daisy warned of impending danger.

According to Miss Owen, Daisy also barks instinctively seconds before the phone rings and can even tell when her owner is about to get out of her seat by offering up her paw.

Miss Owen said the little cockerpoo - a cocker spaniel poodle cross - has already predicted a car crash and a potentially lethal accident in her master's bathroom.

Daisy first showed an ability to foresee danger in February this year when she became agitated and started howling while Judy was driving.

Miss Owen slowed down and just minutes later, a fellow driver ploughed into the back of her car as it pulled out of a junction and sent the motor hurtling into a wall.

Incredibly, Miss Owen escaped serious injury because she had slowed down as a result of Daisy's barking.

On another occasion, Daisy started to run round Judy's apartment in Worcester at 4am - just hours before a shower screen shattered in her bathroom.

Shop owner Miss Owen, who is not married and lives on her own, said: 'A few Sundays ago I went to bed as normal, but at 4am Daisy suddenly awoke and began rushing round my apartment - nothing seemed to quieten her.

'After about half an hour I persuaded her to come back into the bedroom where she jumped up on the bed and lay horizontally next to me, pushing her little body against mine.

'Two hours later there was a huge explosion in the bathroom. My glass shower door had exploded and sent pieces of glass everywhere - they'd even gone flying out into the hallway.

'Just before it happened Daisy wouldn't leave my side, she wouldn't let me go, she just wanted me to stay there.

'Maybe she heard the glass cracking first, I didn't know what was going to happen but she seemed to sense something and wanted to protect me.

'If it had happened two hours later when I usually have a shower I would, without a doubt, have been very badly injured.

'The first time I noticed Daisy's sixth sense was back in February, when I was driving and she started getting agitated, I got quite cross with her making such a fuss.

'Then a few minutes later a man went into the back of me and sent my car flying into a wall - it was a complete write-off. Luckily neither of us was hurt, although Daisy was very shaken.

'It could have been much worse but because I'd slowed down to calm Daisy we weren't going that fast at the time of the impact.

'She's normally a very placid dog so it's very out-of-character for her to get agitated and howl.

'Whenever she does it in future I might just lock myself away because I'll know something bad is on the way. I strongly believe Daisy has psychic powers. There is really no other explanation for it.'

Miss Owen believes her close bond with Daisy, who she got as a ten-week-old puppy, allows her to interpret signals from her dog.

The inseparable pair spend most of the day together, and Daisy even meets and greets customers at her master's boutique in Worcester city centre.

Daisy has another unusual talent - picking up litter when she goes for her daily walk by the canal.

Miss Owen added: 'I think she saw me always picking the rubbish up and picked up the habit herself. She's an amazing little dog, she's like a little child really.'
