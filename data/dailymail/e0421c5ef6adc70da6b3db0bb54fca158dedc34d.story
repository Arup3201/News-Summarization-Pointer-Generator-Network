Neymar has been cleared to play for Barcelona by the team's doctors after recovering from a broken vertebra   suffered during the World Cup.

The forward is now available for selection and could feature in a friendly against Mexican club Leon at the Nou Camp on Monday.

The 22-year-old hurt his back in a collision with defender Juan Camillo Zuniga during Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win over Colombia.

That injury ruled him out of the semi-final against Germany, which Brazil lost 7-1 to the eventual champions.

Luis Suarez is set to make his debut for Barcelona against Leon after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the striker could train and take part in friendlies despite his four month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Barca had been hoping the Uruguayan's ban would be reduced and that he could return to competitive action before October 26.
