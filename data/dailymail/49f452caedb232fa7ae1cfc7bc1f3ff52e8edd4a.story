If you've got it, flaunt it. And Labour MP's wife Karen Danczuk certainly isn't afraid of doing exactly that. 

Just two days ago the councillor, who is known by her army of Twitter followers for her fondness for photos of her ample decolletage, posted her most revealing photo yet, of herself wearing a very skimpy bikini.

Yesterday she followed it up with yet more selfies, taken as she agonised over her outfit for an event at the Labour Party conference in Manchester.

Mrs Danczuk posted this shot on Twitter yesterday, a day after posing for a bikini selfie

She accompanied it with a message that seemed to be seeking affirmation from her 17,000 Twitter fans

In her first picture of yesterday, the councillor from Rochdale, who is married to MP Simon Danczuk, wore a black low cut top with the caption: 'Right folks I've got 2 very exclusive parties to attend tonight. I hope I look ok? KD #happytuesday'.

Just eight minutes later she followed it up with another picture of herself, this time wearing red, saying: 'Second thoughts - Let's celebrate #labour and wear Red!!!! Now I feel ready!! KD' 

A second photo, posted eight minutes later, showed Mrs Danczuk in a red outfit that was barely less revealing

'Now I feel ready!!' she tweeted - and doubtless her many Twitter followers would agree that she looked it

It follows Monday's picture of her raciest shot to date where she appeared in a skimpy bikini top, showing off her cleavage, alongside the message: 'How chuffed do I look? I've faced my fear & swam in the sea for the first time in my life! It was fab. I'm made up. KD'. 

Mrs Danczuk has gained more than 17,000 followers after posting more than 50 pictures of herself on the site.

But now it seems her fame is spreading worldwide with one Spanish website speculating that she could be a new international star. 

The Spanish website Enlace Virtual featured Monday's bikini shot alongside an article that concluded: 'Let's wait to see if we are witnessing the birth of a new star.'

Since gaining fame through her selfies the 31-year-old has also sparked rumours that she could soon be featuring on the nation's television screens, having revealed she has been in talks with Channel 4.

Mrs Danczuk wrote: 'I've got dinner with the big bosses from Channel 4 later. Killer heels or sensible heels?? That is the question!! KD'

But critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk for her pictures but she has continued to address criticism posting: 'I agree there are gender equality issues, but to suggest a woman can't embrace her sexuality just in case is madness. Its me & my curves! KD'.

Earlier this year Mrs Danczuk, who says she has been urged by friends to run for parliament, was embroiled in a furious online Twitter spat with the former Tory MP Louise Mensch over pictures of her cleavage.

The Labour councillor today told her thousands of Twitter followers that she has been sunbathing topless on holiday after Mrs Mensch publicly accused her of demeaning women in politics by posting pictures of her cleavage online.

But Mrs Danczuk hit back - accusing Mrs Mensch of being 'obsessed' with her chest and called on her to stop 'bitching' about other women in politics.
