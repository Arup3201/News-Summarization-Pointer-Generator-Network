Tonight's grand final of the Great British Bake Off is expected to draw over four million viewers. Not bad for a genteel BBC2 show about cakes.

The show has become one of BBC2’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc and judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry whip up a TV storm.

The show has been credited with making baking cool again, and reminding boys where the kitchen is (tonight's final is all male and judge Paul Hollywood's heartthrob status continues to soar). But Brtiain's love of baking isn't really new at all - just ask your grandmother.

The trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century

From the launch of Good Housekeeping magazine in the 1920s to the introduction of TV chefs post-Coronation in the 1950s, the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends.

Today's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking, and in the 1980s celebrity chef Delia Smith stirred our passions for the kitchen with her 'How to Cook' book.

Factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s, rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s.

To celebrate National Baking Week (which runs from 15th-21st October) and the Great British Bake Off final kitchen appliance company Kenwood has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from Wendy Wilson, archivist from Britain's oldest weekly women's magazine The Lady, and Dr Valerie Mars, a food historian.

Dr Mars says: 'Baking trends are essentially uneven. Some people will always bake, especially in places with a long-standing tradition such as Yorkshire, but fashion also has a huge influence. In the current economic climate, an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times.'
