United Airlines has been plagued by nationwide computer issues that’s forcing the airline to issue handwritten notes to travelers.

Passengers took their frustrations to 
social networking sites, with some saying boarding passes are being 
hand-written by United employees.

The glitch was another in a long string of technology problems that began when United merged computer systems with Continental's in March.

United acknowledged at least 200 delayed
 flights were affected by the error. Its passenger reservation system and website stopped working 
for about two-and-a-half hours on Tuesday afternoon, although the 
precise cause wasn't known.

The first formal announcement from the company came via Twitter, when United confirmed the glitch on Tuesday 
afternoon by tweeting: 'We have a network outage & are 
working to get systems back online. We'll update soon.'

The outage didn't affect planes in flight.

Passengers in several United hubs 
reported very long lines at ticket counters. During the outage it 
stopped sending planes to its hubs in Newark, New Jersey, and San 
Francisco.

They grounded flights to its hubs in San Francisco, Houston, and Newark, New Jersey, earlier on Tuesday but planes were taking off again by about 4:30pm Central time.

Long lines and residual delays, continued into the evening.

Blacked out: Flights have been affected as United's computers have gone down nationwide

Simon Duvall spent two hours sitting 
on his flight waiting for the computer problems to be resolved. People 
were calm but not happy, he said.

'We're on a plane, on the tarmac in Las Vegas in the middle of August. It's warm. It's uncomfortable. It's cramped,' he said.

Rich Pearson, head of marketing at 
professional freelance site Elance, was stuck in Houston on his way to 
present at a jobs seminar at the Republican convention in Tampa, 
Florida.

Planes were lined up on the tarmac. 
'It's almost like horseback riding when they are all nose-to-butt,' 
Pearson said. 'It's like we've gone back 50 years.'

'People are relatively calm,' he added. 'The customer service area was initially flooded. But they can't really do anything.'

Glitches: United Continental Holdings Inc. has been battling technical problems since it combined some of its major computer systems in March

United's website was also down, as the airline struggled to solve the problems and minimize any impact to its operations.

FlightAware reported that the issues affected ticketing, reservations and flight check-ins.

United said it would not charge the 
usual change fees for passengers on affected flights who want to cancel 
or rebook their tickets, and apologized for the disruption.

United Continental Holdings Inc. has 
been struggling with computer issues off and on since March, when it 
switched to using Continental's system for tracking passenger 
information. The two airlines merged in 2010.

Airlines rely on software to know who
 is filling the seats on its planes, and how many empty seats are 
available. The same computer programs are used to issue boarding passes.
