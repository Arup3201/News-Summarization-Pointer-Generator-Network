Bond: Toby Hart, 16, and his 11-year-old brother Stephen, whom he was trying to protect when he fell to his death

A 16-year-old plunged 60ft to his death from cliffs while trying to protect his younger brother who has special needs, an inquest heard.

Toby Hart slipped off the precipice while making sure his 11-year-old vulnerable sibling Stephen was not too close to the edge.

Toby and Stephen and Toby’s friend Jamie had gone rock climbing and scaled the top of a 60ft cliff while the rest of the family stayed on the beach.

They were walking along the top where Toby flanked his brother so he did not get to close to the edge in Cadgwith, on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall.

Toby and Jamie had been friends since birth and had always walked either side of Stephen to ensure his safety.

But Toby lost his footing and fell 60ft onto rocks - on the beach where his parents were sat enjoying a holiday, an inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard.

Speaking after the inquest, their devastated father Graham, 50, a Volkswagen franchise manager, said: ‘He had a fantastic personality and everyone loved him.

‘We will remember him for his cheeky smile and a great outlook on life.

‘Toby and Jamie have always been very close. They would always keep Stephen in between them to ensure his safety, even if that was just walking down a path.

‘The fact that Toby died when trying to protect and ensure the safety of his little brother sums him up well - he was extremely caring.’

Risk: The Todden in Cadgwith in Cornwall, where Toby Hart had a fatal fall while his mother and father sat on the beach

The family were enjoying the second day of a week-long holiday with his family and best friend, when the incident happened just days before his 17th birthday.

Kind Toby, from Lowton in Cheshire, had climbed the Todden, a mass of land which separates two beaches, with his brother and pal.

But a piece of grass gave way and Toby fell and his father Graham ran across the beach to find his son wedged between two boulders after his fall on July 22 last year.

Accident: Tragically Toby lost his footing on The Todden, a mass of land that separates two beaches

Witness Phillipa Sharp, an off-duty nurse who was visiting Cadgwith, told the inquest she saw the three boys about one metre from the edge of the cliff.

She said: ‘I glanced up again to see that one of them had slipped. His arms were failing. He struck the cliff twice before cartwheeling through the air.’

Phillipa ran to the scene and tried to resuscitate Toby while others called the emergency services.

He was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro by air ambulance where he died later that day from head injuries.

Remembered: The community of Cadgwith organised for a bench to be placed on the Todden in his memory

Cornwall Coroner Emma Carlyon recorded a verdict of accidental death at Truro City Hall in Cornwall on Monday.

Toby’s parents said there were no warning signs about the dangers of the cliff, but they did not believe that would have prevented his death.

At the age of 14, kind Toby told his parents he wished to register as a organ donor.

Only a few hours after his death, his heartbroken parents agreed to donate his organs, which have since helped to save four lives.

The community of Cadgwith organised for a bench to be placed on the Todden in his memory.

The plaque on the bench reads: ‘Toby’s bench. Sit here and smile, he was having fun. In memory of Toby Hart, aged 16.’

Jamie used his passion for cars and got a job at Honda as a car sales executive in the months before his death. He had also recently taken as a shop assistant at Topman.

Graham said: ‘He was car mad and was excelling in his new job. He also loved football and supported Liverpool like his granddad.’

Since his death, his parents have set up a charity called ‘Toby’s gift’, which they have used to promote awareness for organ donation and raise funds for cystic fibrosis, a disorder in which a friend of Toby’s suffers from and a disease he took great interest in.
