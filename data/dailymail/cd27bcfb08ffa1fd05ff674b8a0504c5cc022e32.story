There was a warm hug between Nigel Pearson and Gus Poyet at the end of this draw that sums up the worth of this point for both managers.

It ends Leicester’s run of four successive defeats that has taken the wind out of their sails and means a first clean sheet for Sunderland since before their chastening 8-0 defeat to Southampton.

Yet it extends the number of minutes Pearson’s side have gone without scoring to 500, territory familiar to Burnley and Aston Villa already this season.

Player Ratings by LAURIE WHITWELL at the King Power Stadium 

They came close to ending their barren spell at times, but the finesse found in moves that opened up the Sunderland defence was lacking when it came to finishing. It seems a long time since Manchester United arrived at the King Power Stadium and left with a defeat and five goals in their against column.

Buddhist monks flown over by Leicester’s Thai owner blessed the players before that game back in September but they have not been back until Saturday. Their methods worked to a degree; a draw can be seen as uplift on recent results.

At times this encounter became feisty, and Lee Cattermole must count himself fortunate in the extreme to have lasted the full 90 minutes.

On the hour mark he launched into a horrible challenge on Esteban Cambiasso that started high and ended with a scissor swipe involving both his legs.

Cattermole claimed Cambiasso had gone to stamp but it merely looked like an effort to guard the ball by the Argentine. Cattermole was reckless, but only yellow carded.

Leicester shaded the early exchanges. Jamie Vardy pounced on a slack touch by Wes Brown to burst clear but Costel Pantilimon was out quickly to divert the ball behind. The Sunderland goalkeeper then held a shot from distance by Riyad Mahrez.

The Algerian winger only returned back from national duty on Friday but was Leicester’s liveliest presence. He produced a wonderful pass that gave Jeff Schlupp an excellent chance to open the scoring, slipping the ball between three Sunderland defenders.

But Schlupp, from the left of the area, slashed his shot into the side-netting. 

Eventually Sunderland roused themselves and crafted a slick move that saw Kasper Schmeichel pull off a superb save to deny Steven Fletcher in the 23rd minute.

The ball travelled quickly from Jordi Gomez to Adam Johnson and his flick set Fletcher clear. But Schmeichel spread his frame and touched Fletcher’s finish just enough to send it wide.

Soon after he made a different type of save of no less quality. Johnson received Seb Larsson’s pass 25 yards from goal, jinked past Esteban Cambiasso and let fly.

The ball swerved and dipped and was heading in uintil Schmeichel sprang to his right to palm it past the post.

Mahrez had a cross that almost went all the way in and another Brown error led to a Leicester attack that presented Leonardo Ulloa and Cambiasso with openings, but both were too shy to shoot, much to the frustration of the home crowd.

At the pother end Larsson was set up by Fletcher’s pull back but Wes Morgan flung his large frame in the way of the Swede’s goal-bound strike.

The interval came at a good time for Leicester, who emerged afterwards renewed with energy.

Matty James burst clear and fired a strong shot that was well saved by Pantillimon, then a smart flighted pass from Cambiasso gave Mahrez room to bamboozle Brown, who ended up on the floor, and hit a shot that was narrowly deflected wide.
