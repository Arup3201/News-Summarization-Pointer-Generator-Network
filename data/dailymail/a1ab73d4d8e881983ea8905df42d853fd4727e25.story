Regulators have been accused of not doing enough to curb payday lenders after new rules were unveiled which did not include a ban on advertising or a cap on sky-high interest rates.

Lenders will have to ensure that only borrowers who can afford to repay their debts, and will only be allowed to roll over loans twice, the Financial Conduct Authority announced today.

The FCA also plans to restrict the number of recurring payments payday firms are allowed to collect following complaints that they are unexpectedly draining borrowers' bank accounts.

But MPs and campaigners complained that lenders would be 'happy' to hear of the new rules, claiming they do not represent a fundamental challenge to the controversial industry.

Crackdown: Payday lenders will have to check their customers are credit-worthy under new rules

The proposed rules will come into effect next April, when the regulator begins overseeing the consumer credit market, including payday lenders.

There had been speculation that the FCA might ban such lenders from advertising their products, but instead it will have enhanced powers to ban misleading ads.

Payday firms have become increasingly controversial thanks to the rise of online lender Wonga, which the Archbishop of Canterbury vowed to 'compete out of existence'.

Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned against payday loans, said she would not be declaring victory and suggested that the public would be 'horrified to hear just how happy the legal loan shark industry is'.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'If we don't act now to change this, I'm convinced this is going to be the next PPI scandal.

'People aren't borrowing for luxury. It's not that they have options, it's that people need to pay their rent. I think we have to look at how we make sure people access affordable credit. The evidence for other countries is that capping does work.'

Controversy: Firms like Wonga have been thrust into the spotlight over the past few months

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey
 criticised the Government's 'shameful failure to act swiftly' and 
called for a cap to be placed on the interest rates that payday lenders 
can charge.

'These 
measures are too little too late and will do nothing to stop people 
falling prey to shady parasitic practices of payday lenders over the 
coming months,' he said.

'They tinker at the margins and do nothing to address the reasons people fall into hardship and the clutches of payday lenders.'

FCA
 chief executive Martin Wheatley said: 'We believe that payday lending 
has a place - many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt
 without a hitch, so we don’t want to stop that happening.

'But
 this type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it 
and payday lenders must not be allowed to drain money from a borrower’s 
account. That is why we’re imposing tighter affordability checks, and 
limiting the use of rollovers and continuous payment authorities.

'Today
 I’m putting payday lenders on notice: tougher regulation is coming and I
 expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome. 
The clock is ticking.'

Outrage: MP Stella Creasy, left, and union boss Len McCluskey, right, spoke out against the new regime

The FCA will take responsibility for regulating more than 50,000 companies in the UK which offer credit to individuals.

The new rules are subject to consultation for the next two months, and a final version will be published in February.

While some of the rules, such as toughter affordability checks, apply to all lenders, some regulations are specific to the payday loan industry because of its 'higher-risk business'.

For example, borrowers will only be allowed to 'roll over' their loans twice, and any who do so will be told how to get free advice on managing their debts.

Under the FCA's proposals, payday 
firms will only be able to make two attempts to use a type of recurring 
payment called a continuous payment authority (CPA) to have a loan paid 
off.

The Office of Fair 
Trading, recently carried out an investigation into payday loans, 
finding 'deep-rooted' problems in the £2billion sector.

It
 said some firms' business models appear to be based around people who 
cannot afford to pay their loan back, meaning they are forced to roll 
their loan over, the original cost balloons and they become effectively 
trapped with their lender.

Checks: Payday lenders will have to ensure that they have investigated the finances of all borrowers

Consumer campaigners welcomed the plans but questioned why stronger action has not come sooner.

Martin
 Lewis, founder of consumer help website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 
'Parasitical payday lenders have taken over our high streets in the last
 five years. Our lax rules have made the UK a crock of gold and they've 
flooded in from across the world.

'For those of us who've been crying out for a crackdown, this hardcore regulation, while not perfect, is very welcome.

'Yet
 the Government should be shamefaced it's taken this long and even now 
it'll be next year before the FCA has the authority to make this work.'

Richard Lloyd, executive director of 
Which?, said: 'Our research shows millions of people are increasingly 
reliant on high cost loans to pay for essentials or to repay other 
debts, so it's good to see the Financial Conduct Authority planning to 
take tough action to clean up credit.

'We
 welcome proposals to tackle unscrupulous payday lenders but we want the
 regulator to go further and use its full powers to clamp down on 
problems faced by struggling consumers across the credit market, like 
sky-high penalty charges.'

Opposition: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has spoken out against payday lenders

Mr Wheatley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the plans will put a stop to some consumers being able to get the green light for a loan in around 10 minutes.

He said: 'The fact you can get a loan in 10 minutes means the person lending to you isn't really doing the proper affordability checking.

'It will be a lengthier process and arguably 10 minutes to get money for people who may not have the ability to repay is too short in any case.

'So certainly it will be a more complex process than exists today but it should mean you are not pushing people into a spiral of debt, which is what we want to avoid.'

Mr Wheatley said a cap on the total cost of credit is also being looked at.

He said: 'We haven't got enough data today to work out whether that would be proportionate or where to place the cap.

'There is a place for lending in society. It's not that we want to remove it entirely. What we want to do is to prevent the social damage it is creating for those people who really can't afford the loans.'

The FCA also said that the fledgling peer-to-peer lending market, which involves websites matching people who want to invest some cash with borrowers, must explain the key risks of a loan before an agreement is made and assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.

It said that a 14-day cooling-off period should allow the borrower to withdraw if they change their mind.

Russell Hamblin Boone, of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents the interests of major payday loan businesses, said a cap on interest would lead to more people turning to illegal lenders.

He said proper checks of customers to make sure they can pay back loans are in place and can be done quickly, similar to any kind of credit product.

He added there has been a cap preventing people from rolling over their loans more than three times.

On a potential interest limit, Mr Hamblin Boone told Today: 'I think you look around globally at other markets and see what's happened, France and Germany for example - three times more people being driven to illegal lending.

'Australia has just introduced one and they've seen a growth in the illegal lending market.'

Earlier this year, Archbishop Justin Welby announced plans to support a new network of credit unions to compete with payday lenders, attacking firms like Wonga for their sky-high rates of interest.

However, Wonga, which offers small loans via the internet, says its services are only meant for short-term borrowers and insists it represents a responsible alternative to High Street lenders.

One in five payday loan customers say they were not asked about their finances when they first borrowed money, it emerged today.

Nearly a quarter of consumers surveyed for new Government research said they had been put under pressure to extend their loan, despite rules agreed by the payday lending industry last year.

While nearly all customers felt they understood the costs of taking out the initial loan, more than half said the costs of extending the debt was not explained properly.

Lenders signed up to new codes last year which promised to improve the affordability checks they carried out and give better support to those who were struggling to pay their loans back.

But the research found that nearly three quarters of consumers felt they were not dealt with sympathetically when in financial difficulty, and just 14 per cent had been told about free sources of debt advice.

Consumer minister Jo Swinson said: 'This research shows that the industry has failed to self-regulate effectively.'
