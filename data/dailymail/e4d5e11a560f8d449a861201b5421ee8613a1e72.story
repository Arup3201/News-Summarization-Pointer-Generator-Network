A three-year-old girl has been left with permanent bright blue marks in her hair after the dye from a hair bobble leaked and stained it.

Scarlett Belfield had been playing outside her home with friends when the tie got wet and the dye ran - leaving unsightly streaks of blue in her long blonde locks.

Dismayed mother Charlotte Hollinshead, 22, has tried washing Scarlett’s hair 15 times following the incident last Friday.

She has tried a variety of ways to clean the dye off - including using washing-up liquid to wash her hair - but they have all failed to work.

The mother-of-two asked a hairdresser for advice, who told her the stubborn dye can only be removed by bleaching her daughter’s hair - or chopping it off.

Furious Charlotte said she contacted high street discount store B&M Bargains - only for staff to tell her that the hair clips weren’t suitable for blondes.

They offered her a refund on the £1.29 bumper pack of hair accessories but refused to apologise or cover the cost of correcting the mistake.

Full time mother Charlotte, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, revealed she is now demanding compensation from the store.

She said: 'Scarlett had been playing in the snow with her dad when she came back in with blue in her hair.

'The dye had completely run out of the bobble and in to her hair, it’s stained it blue and nothing will make it come out.

'I have tried everything and even contacted a hairdressers’ for advice.

'They said that I’d either have to bleach Scarlett’s hair or cut it.

'There’s no way I’m going to bleach a three-year-old girl’s hair so the only thing is to have it cut.

'It would have to be cut very short to get rid of all the blue, so we might wait a bit which means she’s stuck with it for now.

'I called the store to complain but they were really snotty with me - one woman even said "what do you want me to do about it?"

'I couldn’t believe my ears when they told me the bobbles weren’t made for blonde children - how would I have known that?

'If there’s that big a risk they should put a warning on the label.

'It is absolutely ridiculous that a child of that age should get their hair coloured because of a hair tie.'

Scarlett's mother was left embarrassed when parents and teachers at her nursery group even thought Charlotte had put the blue streaks in her hair on purpose.

The youngster’s father Nathan Belfield, 22, a bricklayer, added: 'We had just been out in the street enjoying the snow when it happened.

'The dye was very dark blue at first and we are trying to get her hair back to normal.

'We are angry with what the shop said and we don’t want to have to dye a three-year-old’s hair, it’s just not right.

'I have had teachers at school asking me why her hair is a different colour and I’ve had to explain we haven’t done it.

'It is embarrassing to explain and we would like an apology from the shop and more than a refund.”

Staff at the Old Hall Street store in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, where the bobble was bought, have refused to comment on Charlotte’s complaint.

The firm’s head office were also unavailable for comment today.
