Deborah Carrigan, pictured, was caught stealing cash from an elderly dementia patient's handbag on a CCTV camera installed by the victim's family 

A carer was recorded stealing cash from a 92-year-old dementia patient’s purse by a hidden camera set up by the pensioner’s son, the Old Bailey heard.

Deborah Carrigan, 43, was filmed taking bank notes and coins from the purse of Ada Berlin during lunchtime visits.

The care assistant then wiped down the purse for fingerprints while making sure Mrs Berlin was not looking.

But the pensioner’s son had set up a hidden camera to catch the thief after noticing his mother’s money disappearing faster than normal.

Carrigan, who had ran up debts of £10,000, admitted four counts of theft by abuse of position and was spared jail by the judge, Mr Recorder Sir Geoffrey Nice QC.

‘This was a breach of trust which is more serious because of the vulnerability of the woman you were caring for’, he said.

‘The film shows you were quite alive to the risk of detection.

‘You feared some had caught you and you carried on doing it.

‘The sums you took were small but you were clearly quite determined to pursue on with it.’

Carrigan, from Croydon, was caught out in August last year when secretly recorded taking £75 from Mrs Berlin’s purse in four separate raids.

‘The son would provide his mother with cash, and he was often surprised at how much money his mother got through’, said prosecutor Henry Gordon.

‘He was suspicious money was being taken from her, so on August 3 he set up a covert camera in the kitchen where his mother’s purse was located.

‘He placed a quantity of bank note in the purse.’

Mr Gordon said he collected the footage two days later and saw Carrigan stealing during one of her regular lunchtime visits.

‘She entered the kitchen, looking over her shoulder to where the mother was sitting’, he said.

‘She opened the purse and was seen to take out one bank note and several coins.

‘She was seen to go over to the sink to wipe down the purse, and the money was placed in the defendant’s right pocket.’

Carrigan, who was employed as a carer by Allied Healthcare, visited Mrs Berlin’s home in Caterham, Surrey, each lunchtime.

The Old Bailey heard that Carrigan wiped down her fingerprints from her victim's purse after taking the cash

The pensioner was suffering from dementia and memory loss, and received three visits a day from different carers, the court heard.

Carrigan was caught out again in footage collected on August 15 last year using a tea towel to hold the purse while she swiped some cash.

The camera caught her repeating the thefts twice more, on August 16 and 17, before Mrs Berlin’s family called police.

‘She said she hadn’t done it and said the elderly lady asked her to buy incontinence pads and E45 cream’, said Mr Gordon.

‘She said she always provided the elderly lady with the change and receipts.’

Carrigan tried to claim she had wiped down the purse due to OCD tendencies, but ‘her account was rebutted by the daughter in law who says she is the one tasked with buying incontinence pads.’

The carer finally confessed when the case was brought to trial, the court heard.

James Hasslacher, defending, said Carrigan is now working as a bar maid in Wetherspoons but fears she will now lose that job due to her conviction.

He added she has been the subject of an anonymous Facebook campaign against her as a result of the thefts.

She was given a three months prison sentence suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 12 months of supervision and 200 hours community service.

Carrigan also has to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
