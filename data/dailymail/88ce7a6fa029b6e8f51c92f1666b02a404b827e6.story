The fianc√© of 'Mob Wives' star Ramona Rizzo has been sentenced to 15 years in prison, throwing a spanner in the works of the lavish wedding she has been planning.

Joseph 'Joe Boy' Sclafani, 47, recieved the sentence on Friday after pleading guilty to distributing cocaine and he was shipped off in handcuffs while Rizzo watched at Brooklyn Federal Court.

The alleged member of the Gambino crime family was arrested in 2011 and admitted in April that he had distributed the drug received from another mob associate, Neil Lombardo.

'I can't even find a reason why I made the decision,' Sclafani told the judge this week of his drug dealing. 'I made some bad ones and it's definitely my worst decision.'

Rizzo, who stars in the VH1 reality TV show, declined to say what she'll do about her wedding plans, according to RadarOnline.

The
granddaughter of famous Bonnano mobster Benjamin 'Lefty Guns' Ruggiero 
sported high heels and oversized sunglasses for the court appearance. 
Ruggiero was played by Al Pacino in the 1997 film 'Donnie Brasco.'

It
came out in February that Rizzo was planning to tie the knot with 
Sclafani in a glamorous wedding with more than 500 guests, even though 
the groom would have been in jail for the ceremony. The wedding was planned for Coral House on Long Island in June but didn't happen.

Rizzo
said she would 'pass around the phone' during the wedding so that her 
fiance Joseph 'Joe Boy' Sclafani can 'participate' from his cell at 
Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.

'He didn't want to begrudge me a wedding,' Rizzo told the New York Post. 'He said, "Even if I can't be there, have a party. I'll be there in spirit."'

Scalfani, a reputed Gambino crime 
family soldier, was implicated in a cocaine ring that saw doormen at 
swanky addresses accepting packages of drugs to pass along to mobsters, 
according to the Post.

In
1989 Scalfani was wounded during the mob assassination of Costabile 
'Gus' Farace, who had become one of America's most wanted fugitives 
after he murdered an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency agent on Staten 
Island, New York.

He was later convicted of helping the suspected cop-killer evade nationwide manhunt.

Rizzo said her family they didn't want her to get involved in 'the life,' but she couldn't help it. She married a Jordanian with whom she had four kids - though she claims his business dealings were connected to organized crime in the U.S. and the Middle East.

She said her children are supportive of her relationship with Scalfani.

'People should find their own way of love. I hope this inspires other people. We are praying for the best,' Rizzo told the Post. 'If you love somebody before they got kicked down, why wouldn't you love them after?

'Maybe the key to a happy marriage is not having a husband in your face all the time.'
