The future of British energy supply 
could be placed in Chinese hands after a major setback for the 
Government’s nuclear plant building programme yesterday.

Centrica had been planning to build four plants with the French supplier EDF, but has now pulled out of the partnership.

EDF will now try to rescue the 
multi-billion-pound scheme by casting around for a new partner, and is 
talking to the Guangdong Nuclear Corporation, which is owned by the 
Chinese government.

Changes: Energy giant Centrica has pulled out of a deal to build four news nuclear power plants, including next to the existing Sizewell development on the Suffolk coast

If a deal went ahead, it would mean much of Britain’s future nuclear power supply would be controlled by a consortium which is owned by the governments of France and China.

The building of nuclear power stations to replace existing ageing plants is central to Government energy policy.

Without it, the country faces the prospect of a gap between energy demand and supply within 20 years and even possible blackouts.

Centrica, which owns British Gas, was Britain’s only energy company with the financial resources and expertise to invest in building new nuclear power stations.

Its decision to pull out was driven by concerns at the rise in costs following changes to regulations after Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011.

A deal with EDF would have given Centrica a 20 per cent stake in two reactors at Hinckley Point, Somerset and two at Sizewell, Suffolk.

Withdrawal: Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica, claims increased project costs and an extended construction timetable means they must pull out

The company will now write off some £200million that was spent developing the proposal for the stations.

While Centrica will not be building 
new nuclear reactors, it still retains a  20 per cent stake in eight 
existing power stations, which are due for closure over the next 20 
years.

Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw 
said: ‘Since our initial investment, the anticipated costs have 
increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of 
years.

‘These factors, in particular the 
lengthening time frame for a return on the capital invested in a project
of this scale, have led us to conclude that participation is not right 
for Centrica and our shareholders.’ 

Centrica is not alone in turning its 
back on new nuclear plants. Last year, German power giants RWE and Eon 
abandoned plans to build reactors here.

The uncertainty has been fuelled by 
questions over how to store the waste. Cumbria recently rejected a plan 
to store it underground and no alternatives have been identified.

Environmentalists believe the 
Government should switch investment to alternatives, such as wind. 
However, building new wind farms is hugely expensive and reliant on 
subsidies through customers’ bills.

Despite the setback, the Government said it will press ahead with nuclear power.

The Department of Energy and Climate 
Change said: ‘We are determined to make the UK a leading global 
destination for investment in new nuclear, which will play a key role in
our future energy mix.

‘The decision by Centrica reflects the company’s investment priorities and is not a reflection on UK government policy.’

Greenpeace policy director, Doug Parr, said: ‘The Centrica pull-out has exposed a very troubled UK energy strategy.

‘This Government’s relentless focus 
on new nuclear has lost us years of investment in truly green energy and
it now needs a Plan B to deliver a clean, safe energy system – one that
doesn’t depend on deluded estimates of how much nuclear will get 
built.’

The GMB union said the only option is 
to nationalise nuclear power, bringing it under UK control, rather than 
leaving it to the governments of France and China.
