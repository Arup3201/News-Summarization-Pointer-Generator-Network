A 58-year-old motorist was callously run down from behind after confronting a driver who was tailing him.

The unnamed man, who was driving a Nissan Almera through Moscow in Russia, got out of his car at a red light to ask the driver behind him why he was being followed.

But rather than answer his question, the driver, who has been named as Igor Kalmykov, waits for the man to turn his back then accelerates into him.

Looking on: The driver, named as Igor Kalmykov, gets out of his car and spends a second looking at the hurt man before inspecting his own car for damage and driving off

The victim, who was climbing back into his own car at the time, was dragged along the road by the car before it comes to a stop just a few feet in front of him.

While the injured man was writhing in agony on the floor, clutching his hip, Kalmykov gets out, inspects his own vehicle, and drives off.

The incident was captured by another driver on a 'dashcam' recorder, which are commonly used by Russian drivers for insurance reasons.

Help at last: Members of the public eventually come to the aid of the man, who had been writhing on the road

He told the Life News website: 'I just moved along the road and beeped to this BMW to make him take left or right, so I could overtake him.

'He began to drive close behind me. As we stopped at the traffic light, I went out and asked him: "Why are you chasing me? Did I offend you?"

'Then I went back to my car and as I was opening the door he just hit me at great speed.'

The man was speaking from hospital but his injuries are unknown.

Kalmykov is believed to have been detained by police for questioning pending expected criminal charges.

He had recently bought the BMW from a car hire company whose spokesman said: 'We have assisted the police and the offender was taken for investigation.'

Many Rusisan drivers now use 'dashcams' for their own protection in potential insurance claims, which have brought to light a host of road rage incidents that might otherwise go unnoticed by police.
