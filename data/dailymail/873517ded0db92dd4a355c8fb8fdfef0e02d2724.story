All England have to do, it seems, to go a long way in the World Cup is play anyone other than Australia.

They romped to an emphatic nine-wicket victory over an awful West Indies here at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the first of two warm-up games that are supposed to provide preparation for the big challenges ahead.

Instead England would have gained little other than a confidence boost from thrashing opponents who looked even more uninterested than the India side who sleepwalked their way through the Tri-series.

At the centre of the walkover was Chris Woakes, who went wicketless while conceding 89 runs against Australia last week but who now bounced back with a five-wicket haul gained at the expense of just 19 as West Indies were bundled out for 122 in under 30 overs.

Ian Bell then led England home in company with James Taylor in the most comfortable of run chases after Moeen Ali, reprieved when caught off a Jason Holder no ball on seven, had hit 46 off 43 balls.

West Indies bad attitude was summed up by the fact that Chris Gayle, who hardly exerted himself when he was dismissed by his first ball, did not bother taking to the field for England's reply.

England have now won five out of eight matches on this tour but the trouble is that the three defeats have all come against an Australian side who will start as hot favourites for this World Cup that begins in Melbourne on Saturday.

Still, if England continue the habit of dismissing inferior opposition then they can afford to lose at the MCG and still exceed expectations which saw them dismissed as complete no-hopers before they came here a month ago.

This was a quite dreadful performance from West Indies. They simply did not appear to have any heart for the battle under cloudy Sydney skies and with the greenish pitch offering seam movement and a little bounce.

That was no real excuse for some of the pathetic shots played by a West Indies team who on days like this are little short of an embarrassment to a region with such a rich and proud cricketing heritage.

All, of course, is not well with the modern day West Indies. They quit their tour of India in October over a pay dispute and have arrived here without two of their best players in Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard as a consequence.

Even their opening press conference here on Sunday was a tetchy affair with their normally affable media manager stepping in to stop innocuous questions to their new and very raw young captain Jason Holder about Gayle.

They will have to bat a lot better than this if they are to avoid falling victims to the ‘minnows’ in their World Cup group in Ireland, Zimbabwe and the UAE. On this form a quarter-final place is far from certain for West Indies.

The tone was set at the off when Woakes, mauled by Australia in his last outing eight days ago, took two wickets with successive balls in the first over, Gayle and Darren Bravo both being undone by a little extra bounce.

This was an important day for Woakes, who has had a good winter but who risks losing the new ball to Stuart Broad when the World Cup begins in front of 90,000 on Saturday.

West Indies certainly had much more difficulty in playing the Warwickshire man than Australia did in the Tri-series final in Perth, with only Lendl Simmons displaying any degree of permanence.

Simmons did hit one huge six into the famous SCG pavilion off James Tredwell, who had bowled Jonathan Carter with his first ball, but fell five runs short of his half century when he became one of Woakes' five victims.

Perhaps the worst of a catalogue of poor shots came from Marlon Samuels, who played all round a straight ball from Steven Finn, who was not at his best and was perhaps flattered by taking two wickets.

Other than Finn, England bowled well in the absence of the rested Broad and Jimmy Anderson, with both Tredwell and Chris Jordan taking the chances presented them by gaining practice against pliable opponents.

There were also an important seven overs for Ravi Bopara who, according to coach Peter Moores, had ‘not taken’ the bowling opportunities presented to him so far on tour and came into this warm-up under a little pressure.

There were no such concerns here, with Bell finishing unbeaten on 35, and England can only hope for a more testing time when they face Pakistan here on Wednesday. Then it is the small matter of Australia again when it will really count.
