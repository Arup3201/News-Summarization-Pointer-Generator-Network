Ailing phone group BlackBerry bought a private jet worth over $20 million just months before it laid off 4,500 workers and  reported a nearly $1 billion second-quarter loss, it was revealed on Sunday.

Ill-timed executives had the second-hand Bombardier Global Express delivered in July and explained the decision as a cost-cutting exercise as the plane replaced two older aircraft.

But perhaps after a closer look at their accounts, the company announced on Sunday it will now sell the latest addition to their fleet and will no longer own any private jets.

'Several years ago, the company bought two medium-range Dassault aircraft,' BlackBerry said in a statement reported by the Financial Times.

'Earlier
 this year the company decided to sell both planes and replace them with
 one longer-range aircraft. The company considered several options and 
selected a used Bombardier aircraft, which was eventually delivered in 
July,' it continued.

This
 ultra long-range jet can fly between Tokyo and New York without 
refueling. A used aircraft will typically cost between $20 - $30 million.

Blackberry
 said on Friday that it will lay off thousands of employees, or 40 per 
cent of its global workforce, as it reported a nearly $1 billion 
second-quarter loss a week earlier than expected.

The stock dropped 23 per cent to $8.11 after reopening for trading. Shares had been halted earlier pending the news announced the same day rival Apple's latest iPhone models went on sale.

Sunday's statement on the private jet purchase added: 'In light of the company’s current 
business condition, the company has decided to sell that aircraft along 
with the two legacy aircraft and will no longer own any planes.'

BlackBerry had been scheduled to release earnings this week.

But the Canadian company said late Friday afternoon that it expects to post a staggering loss of $950 million to $995 million for the quarter, including a massive write down of the value of its inventory due to increasing competition.

Revenue of $1.6 billion is only about half of the $3 billion that analysts expected, according to FactSet.

The
 company's expected adjusted loss of 47 cents to 51 cents per share 
falls far below the loss of 16 cents per share projected by Wall Street.

BlackBerry
 said it wants to slash operating costs in half by the first quarter of 
2015 so cutting its global headcount to 7,000 total employees is 
necessary.

'We are 
implementing the difficult, but necessary operational changes announced 
today to address our position in a maturing and more competitive 
industry, and to drive the company toward profitability.' Thorsten 
Heins, President and CEO of BlackBerry, said in a statement.

The
 BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, was the dominant smartphone for 
on-the-go business people and other customers before Apple debuted the 
iPhone in 2007.

Since then, BlackBerry Ltd. has been hammered by competition from the iPhone as well as Android-based rivals like Samsung.

The iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, Apple's latest and greatest, went on sale earlier Friday, flying off shelves at a record pace.

Since 2007, BlackBerry has lost 93 per cent of its market share, with half going in the past year alone

Marked
 by the usual lines around the block and triumphant Apple fans walking 
out of Apple Stores to cheers, the new models received rave reviews from
 consumers and media alike.

The most-hyped new feature on the 5S is a new fingerprint sensor used to unlock the phone, making passwords and finger swipes 'a waste of time.'

It also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor. It has sold out around the world, say reports.

In January, Blackberry unveiled new phones running a revamped operating system called BlackBerry 10.

The Z10 and Q10 were designed to better compete for customers and rejuvenate the brand. But vendor marketing was uneven and BlackBerry's market share continues to lag its rivals.

BlackBerry said last month that it would consider selling itself. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company reiterated Friday that a special committee of its board of directors continues to evaluate all options.

It also seemed to say that it would shift its focus back to competing mainly for the business customers most loyal to its brand.

'Going forward, we plan to refocus our
 offering on our end-to-end solution of hardware, software and services 
for enterprises and the productive, professional end user,' said Heins.

'This
 puts us squarely on target with the customers that helped build 
BlackBerry into the leading brand today for enterprise security, 
manageability and reliability.'

Not an iPhone killer: New Blackberry models have failed to impress ever-more choosy consumers flocking to Apple and Android devices

A stark contrast to the hype surrounding every iPhone launch, Blackberry's last new model dropped with a thud. Despite a massive advertising push and aggressive in-store sales tactics, the Z10 fell flat - despite rave reviews from the tech press.

Blackberry's once leading market share has been eroded by both Apple and Samsung. Though there haven't been many lines for Samsung products, the South Korean electronics giant sells more smartphones than any other phone manufacturer - android or otherwise.
