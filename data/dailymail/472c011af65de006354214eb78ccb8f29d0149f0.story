Reluctant: Joshua Silverman won't be pinning his hopes on popularity in jail after he was given the chance to escape - and called 911

A prisoner won't be pinning his hopes on popularity in jail after finding himself caught up in the middle of an escape - and calling 911.

Joshua Silverman was given the chance to flee when two other inmates hijacked the van he was being transported in, which had been left unattended outside a hospital in Weatherford, Oklahoma.

Unbelievably, instead of making a run for it, he dialed 911 and alerted the police about the escape.

'Ma'am, you're probably not going to believe this, but I'm a prisoner in a van, and I'm here with a couple of these other cats,' he politely explained to the emergency operator.

'A couple of the guys that were in the van jacked the van at the hospital.'

The security vehicle was being driven by guards from the Prison Transportation Service when it stopped at the hospital on Tuesday to drop off some ill inmates.

The guards accompanied the sick prisoners into the building - leaving eight other inmates unsupervised in the vehicle.

They also left keys in the van's ignition so the prisoners could have air conditioning.

Inmates Lester Burns and Michael Coleman took their chance to escape - kicking out a partition in the van, before moving up front and driving off.

They travelled for about a mile before ditching the vehicle and fleeing on foot, according to police.

However, Silverman, one of six inmates left behind, was reluctant to escape.

Still shackled, he managed to climb out of the van and dial 911 with a mobile phone police believe he might have found in the vehicle.

Silverman struggled to explain the van's whereabouts to the operator - but volunteered to walk to a nearby road to flag down an officer.

'We're in Oklahoma somewhere. I don't know because we're not on a road and I'm not from here,' he said. 'I just don't want to get shot by no cops or nothing.'

The operator then asked Silverman where the rest of the prisoners were.

'We're all in the van,' said Silverman. 'Two of the dudes took off. The dudes that were doing whatever they were doing took off.'

The prisoner remained on the phone until a police officer arrived on the scene.

Silverman, who was in custody on drug-related charges, was being taken to Wisconsin when the van was hijacked, according to Weatherford assistant police chief Louis Flowers.

Wisconsin court records indicate the prisoner had been convicted of bail jumping, drug manufacturing and disorderly conduct over the past few years.

Mr Flowers said Silverman's call had helped police narrow their search for Burns and Coleman, who were recaptured and taken back into custody on Tuesday evening.

'It helped us locate them a lot quicker,' said Mr Flowers. 'We didn't know what direction they were traveling in and his call helped us pinpoint their location.'

All of the inmates were from jails in the western and northern U.S. and were being transported to agencies in those parts of the country.
