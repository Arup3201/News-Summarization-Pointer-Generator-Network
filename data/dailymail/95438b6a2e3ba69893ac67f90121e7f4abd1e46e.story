Bosses at Milton Keynes' tourist board have offered to give X-Factor host Dermot O'Leary a tour of the town after he tweeted he was off to the ‘land of roundabouts.’

Destination MK, the official tourism service for the town, said they would love to show the Radio 2 DJ around after he called residents ‘roundabout loving Keynesian's’.

The 41-year-old posted the tweets to his 2.4m followers before heading to WHSmiths in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire on Thursday to sign copies of his new book, The Soundtrack To My Life.

Dermot O'Leary described Milton Keynes' residents as 'roundabout-loving Keynesians' ahead of a visit to the town on Thursday

Dermot, who has hosted ITV talent show the X-Factor for seven years, wrote: ‘So it appears I'm off to the land of roundabouts on Thursday. Hope to see you Keynesian's there. 

'And you Miltonite's too’.

He followed it up with a second message that read: ‘Alright my roundabout loving Keynesian's I'm coming to say hello. (I'm off to Milton Keynes).’

Some fans teased that he would need a satellite navigation device to reach his destination, while another wished him luck navigating the town’s road system.

The town, which has a population of 230,000 people, has more roundabouts per square mile than any other in the country, with a total of 130 - an average of 3.82 per sq mile

But Destination Milton Keynes tweeted back: ‘There's more to MK than just roundabouts (but we do have a lot of them) we'd love to show around!’

Steven Gordon-Wilson, Chief Executive of Destination Milton Keynes told the MailOnline: 'It's a truth universally acknowledged - Milton Keynes is full of roundabouts. 

'It's part of the UK story and why wouldn't we be happy? It's a mighty fine road network! 

'Of course we'd prefer Dermot to call us the home of Bletchley Park, The Open University or the UK's first ever multiplex cinema; or to reference any of the countless record breaking plaudits we can boast in the worlds of leisure, business and tourism.

'Maybe after his recent visit he will do next time. He did call us 'Keynesians' in his tweet though.

'I like it, I hope that catches on!'
