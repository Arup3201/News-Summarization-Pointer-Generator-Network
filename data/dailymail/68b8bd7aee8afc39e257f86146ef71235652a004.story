Sarah Palin has been fined for speeding in Alaska after being caught driving at 63mph in a 45 zone.

The former state governor was in a Toyota Tundra in her home town of Wasilla at the time.

She tried to blame her lawbreaking, which took place last Wednesday, on Sammy Hagar's I Can't Drive 55, according to TMZ.

She also told the site: ‘I wasn't speeding, I was qualifying.’

Ms Palin, 50, was reportedly fined $154.

On Saturday GOP vice presidential candidate Palin blasted President Barack Obama and demanded his removal from office.

The tea party speaking-circuit darling said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado that talk of impeachment 'has got him nervous.'

Condemning the White House's response to a swarm of illegal immigrants cascading across the U.S.-Mexico border, she accused Obama of 'not defending [America's] borders and called it a 'dereliction of duty, violating the oath of office.'

'If that's not impeachable, then nothing is,' she said to generous applause. 'And if he's not impeachable, no one is.'

'Unaccompanied Alien Children': The Obama administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers, most of them children traveling without adults.

The White House has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis, but has drawn the ire of Republicans by doing little to suggest a plan to secure the border

'No serious person can deny that team Obama has abused and violated the public trust and the Constitution,' Palin charged.

'The list of abuses, it goes on and on.'
