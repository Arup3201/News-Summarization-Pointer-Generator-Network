Louis van Gaal says that he is looking for the ‘perfect game’ from Manchester United – and does not agree with Sir Alex Ferguson that results are all that matter.

United are on a run of six straight wins as they prepare to face Aston Villa on Saturday, but the Dutchman is still demanding a better level of performance from his players.

‘I’m not only focused on results though of course that’s the main thing,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When I speak to Sir Alex he says “what’s the problem, you’ve won”. But when you perform well you shall win more and that’s what I want to show to the fans, and the players want it also. The guarantee of wins is better when you perform better.’

‘For example, the game against Hull was a good game. We dominated for 90 minutes and I want to see more games like that. There are too few games we are dominating 90 minutes. That’s the process. We have to wait and see but, of course, when you win six times a row then the confidence is rising.

‘I’m still looking for a game that is closer to the perfect game that we’ve given until now.’

Asked if last weekend’s 3-0 win at home to Liverpool had given his players a big confidence boost, Van Gaal claimed that it was no ‘great surprise’ that they beat their old rivals.

He added: ‘I don't think that one game had a big influence until now because, okay, the results are very good but we can improve the performances as a team. 

‘I am always speaking about the team. I think that the team can improve itself still more and I don't think that it was a great surprise that we won against Liverpool, neither did the players.’

The trip to Villa Park is the first of five games in 15 days for United. Van Gaal has already complained about having to play so much over Christmas but was reluctant to look ahead to the rest of his team’s festive fixture list.

‘It’s game 17, it’s not a game inbetween, the first of five,’ he said. ‘So you can make another division. It’s game 17 in a process.

‘I think we don't have to talk about the games after that. We have to talk about Aston Villa. When you see the last matches, Aston Villa haven’t lost so much, they draw, they win, and when they lose it’s always with one goal difference. So it shall be very difficult. That’s the Premier League.’
