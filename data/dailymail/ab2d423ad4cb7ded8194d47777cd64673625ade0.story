Thousands of people across Europe have faced a second day of disruption following a powerful storm with hurricane-force gusts.

Accidents linked to Hurricane Xaver have killed at least seven people across the continent over the past two days in Poland, Sweden, Denmark and Britain.

In the Pomeranian region of northern Poland, three people were killed and one was injured when a tree fell on a car.

And in western Denmark, a 72-year-old female truck passenger died when the vehicle overturned in howling winds.

Traffic ground to a halt on icy roads and train services were cancelled in large parts of Sweden.

Tens of thousands of people lost electricity and strong winds knocked down the city of Vaxjo's Christmas tree.

Meanwhile, scores of flights were cancelled at airports in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland.

The Polish Institute of Meteorology 
and Water Management forecast wind gusts today of up to 68mph inland
 and up to 85mph off Poland's Baltic seacoast.

Poland's flagship airline LOT also cancelled some domestic and European flights due to 'unexpected weather changes in Europe'.

Copenhagen's international airport 
reopened this morning after an all-night closure and flights resumed but
 delays were expected.

More than 1,000 people spent the night at the airport, where 200 flights were cancelled yesterday and about 70 today.

Some bridges in Scandinavia remained closed and thousands of homes in Sweden and Norway were without power this morning.

Strong winds threatened a collection of Viking ships recovered from the bottom of a Danish fjord in the 1960s and put on exhibition.

Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde 25 miles west of Copenhagen amid fears the water from the surrounding fjord would rise and shatter the glass.

In Hamburg, Germany's second biggest city, the water rose about 13ft above average flood levels today, hitting heights rarely seen and parts of the city's busy port were shut.

Hamburg airport, where almost all flights were cancelled late on Thursday, was open for business today but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow.

Trains northwards from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled.

Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory.

But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days meant the impact of this week's storm on the city was negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life.

A further tidal surge is expected to hit Hamburg this evening.

Also today, a high-speed rail line running 300km between Germany's two largest cities - Hamburg and Berlin - was blocked by debris on the tracks.

Stranded passengers were transferred to buses, according to Deutsche Bahn officials.

Soccer club Werder Bremen, whose game Saturday against German champion Bayern Munich had been in doubt, announced today on Twitter that flood water hadn't topped a levee near its stadium and the match would go ahead.

Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm.

According to European Energy Exchange AG, an energy trading platform, production of wind energy in Germany surged in recent days.

At 1pm local time (12 GMT) the country's 
vast network of on- and offshore wind turbines produced 25,205.8 MW of 
electricity - the equivalent of 25 nuclear plants and almost 35 per cent
 of the country's total energy output that hour.

Meanwhile in Britain, thousands of people evacuated from their homes on low-lying east coast areas yesterday were warned of further woes today in the form of 'exceptionally high tides' - the most serious tidal surge for more than 60 years.

Sea levels are higher in some areas than during devastating floods of 1953 that killed hundreds along the North Sea coast.

Speaking after an emergency government meeting today, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said flood defences strengthened since 1953 had protected more than 800,000 homes.

Almost 8,000 people remained without power in Scotland where 80,000 people lost electricity yesterday, according to energy company SSE.
