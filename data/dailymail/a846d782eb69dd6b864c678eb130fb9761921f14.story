This is the dramatic moment police used a chainsaw to cut open a front door in a raid on a suspected drugs den.

Dressed in helmets and balaclavas, 20 officers from West Mercia Police burst into the flat in Warndon, Worcestershire yesterday afternoon.

Two men and a woman, all in their thirties, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

After cutting a human-sized hole officers burst through the door and fend off two Staffordshire Bull Terriers

Lead by a team of eight members of the Task Force, officers had to use a 3ft-long petrol-powered chainsaw to slice open a hole in the door.

As it came crashing down they were forced to fend off two Staffordshire Bull Terriers using a dog attack deterrent spray called ‘bite back’ to subdue them.

They arrested the three suspects and seized an amount of drugs in the raid, which happened on Randwick Drive at about 3.30pm yesterday.

PC Wayne Hurley, from the Warndon Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: ‘It was a good result. It is all intelligence-based policing. It is a priority for this area that we tackle drugs.

Officers also used a window to gain entry to the flat after developing intelligence it was used as a drug den

‘It has been identified by police, partners and members of the public as the biggest issue we need to be dealing with in Warndon. We take all reports of drugs very seriously.

‘We have been developing intelligence which led to the successful application for a warrant to the magistrates’ court and the execution of that warrant has been very smooth.

‘We are trying to be more proactive in responding to the public and their concerns.’
