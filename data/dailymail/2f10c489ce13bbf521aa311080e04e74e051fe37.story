Tears: Jack Mannino admitted to crying after being caught by federal agents following a bank raid in Brooklyn earlier this year

A prolific bank robber with alleged links to the notorious Gambino crime family has told a New York court that he wept when arrested by federal agents.

Jack Mannino, 43, was known as the 'Seven Second Bandit' due to the speed with which he carried out raids on banks.

But the hardened criminal has admitted to shedding tears when finally caught by federal agents three months after carrying out his last robbery in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn earlier this year.

Giving evidence at the trial of his alleged partner in that raid, Gary Fama, at Brooklyn federal court, Mr Mannino - who turned state witness following his arrest - confessed to crying when he was caught by the FBI.

Mannino had committed 24 New York bank robberies — enough to earn him life behind bars — the New York Post reports.

Mannino, who was in continual debt to loansharks decided to become a state witness following his arrest, according to the Post.

Giving evidence yesterday, he said he had planned and executed the raid with Mr Fama, but that the raid had come unstuck due to unexpected events.

A dye pack had exploded inside the bag of money the pair had stolen while the transmission blew on their getaway car which was eventually abandoned.

Mannino was eventually caught by agents three months later on Staten Island, after they tracked him down using some of the belongings he abandoned in the car.

These included his wallet which was filled with ID and credit cards and a cellphone, the Post reports.
