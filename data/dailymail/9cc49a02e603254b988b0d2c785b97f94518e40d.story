Lionel Messi will battle Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, KIERAN GILL argues why the Barcelona and Argentina superstar should be crowned the world's best player.

‘Lionel Messi broke another record yesterday...’

How many times have those words been written, read, or dropped into conversation since the great Messi won his first Ballon d’Or six years ago?

On Monday  he can win an unprecedented fifth. And to sum up why, just look at the 27-year-old's records between January 1 and December 31, 2014:

And we could name more.

53 - games in 2014

4,748 - minutes played

49 - goals

15 - goals with right foot

32 - goals with left foot

2 - headers

96.90 - minutes per goal

17 - assists 

This is why the Ballon d’Or was established by magazine, France Football, back in 1956 when Sir Stanley Matthews won it first: to recognise the history-makers.

What we’re led to believe by FIFA is the criteria calls for national managers, captains and  journalists to vote for the most outstanding performer of the previous 12 months.

Yet this was no ordinary year.

Messi’s name  on the ballot had Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer for competition. Excessive criticism reared its ugly head at times, but the architect of Barcelona and Argentina was unfazed.

In La Liga, Messi scored 35 goals in 36 matches. Broken down to 11 with the right foot, 23 with the left, the other with the head, despite the odd injury.

Ronaldo scored 38 but was less versatile, getting four with his unfavourable left foot and head. Yet he is the dribbler, the creator, the orchestrator, right? Not entirely. There’s a statistic for that, too.

Messi created 97 chances in La Liga during 2014 - 24 more than any other player - and completed 164 dribbles - 63 more than his nearest rival. Not Ronaldo, but Athletic Bilbao’s Iker Muniain.

It carried to Europe. Messi, channelling his inner Alexander the Great, conquered Nicosia, Cyprus, on November 25 to become the all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League. 

It was his 23rd European city, his 16th European country, and a record 24th different stadium in which he had scored.

The world's media ran out of ways to describe him. 'Senor Record! There are no limits to this extra-terrestrial,' ran one headline. 'A miracle,' ran another.

All this, just about the time Ballon d'Or votes were being submitted. Timing can be everything.  

And so to Brazil between June 12 and July 13. Was he to be Argentina’s modern-day Diego Maradona circa 1986?

The running joke was the Barca boy had such sway over Alejandro Sabella that he could make tactical calls. The hearsay being Messi told the Argentina manager to change to 4-3-3 against Bosnia-Herzegovina at half-time in their Group H opener on June 15, and he obliged.

Was it true? Probably not. But it worked. Messi single-handedly broke the hearts of the Bosnians, then the Iranians, then the Nigerians. Three for three.

Messi and Argentina ultimately could not win the 2014 World Cup but the Barca boy carried them to the final

Do the maths and his four goals directly contributed seven points. The difference between qualifying and going home, tails tucked between legs. Messi carried Argentina to the World Cup final.

Yet that’s where it ended. Neuer won it, but was not necessarily better than the 10 Germans in front of him. Ronaldo, meanwhile, was cursing his luck in Group G.

The Golden Ball, reserved for the tournament's best player, went to Messi, though not without scrutiny, even from 'a little surprised' FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

Yet he got to Rio de Janeiro, and was crowned most outstanding player on the world stage after winning four man-of-the-match awards towards the final. It is perhaps a symptom of being the best. When so much is expected, failure is practically unacceptable. 

His four-year reign over the Ballon d’Or ended in Zurich last year, cutting some figure in a red suit and black bow tie. Ronaldo, rightly, had his turn, and Messi had 2014 to fix it.

This is no slanging match. Far from it. All three candidates, in their own way, have a right to win the famous, old trophy.

But, come Monday night, when he could win an unprecedented fifth Ballon d’Or, maybe that same, old phrase will resurface the next morning: ‘Lionel Messi broke another record yesterday...’
