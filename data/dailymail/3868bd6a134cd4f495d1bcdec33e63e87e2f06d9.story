'Calculated': Francis Knight, 31, posed as teenage girls to target boys as young as nine on Facebook

A paedophile who hacked the Facebook accounts of teenage girls so he could prey on and abuse boys as young as nine has been jailed.

Francis Knight stole the online personas of young girls to stalk and contact more than 250 children on the social networking site over two years.

The 31-year-old used the cloned profiles to befriend six boys  aged between nine and 13 and persuaded them to carry out sex acts while he watched on a one-way webcam.

A court heard how Knight had ‘masqueraded as teenage girls’ and even convinced some of his victims to perform sex acts with their friends for him to view.

Even after the former Tesco store assistant had been arrested and charged, he carried on stalking youngsters online while on bail, Portsmouth Crown Court was told.

Jailing Knight for 16 months, Judge John Dixon said he was a ‘manipulative individual’ with a predilection for young children and his actions were ‘calculated and artful’.

Knight’s own father told the Daily Mail that his ‘disgusting’ son should have been jailed for much longer.

Prosecutor Jane Terry told the court last week how Knight, from Portsmouth, would send ‘friend requests’, under cloned identities, to a group of people who knew each other.

She said he wanted to lull his victims into a false sense of security as they believed they had mutual friends.

During sentencing on Friday, Judge Dixon told Knight: ‘In those online exchanges you had with those boys you deceived them with a one-way webcam.

You could see them but they could not see you. The deception left the victims ashamed of themselves, and their parents distressed and upset.’

Parents of some of the boys sobbed as they heard evidence of what Knight forced their children to do on camera.

The court also heard about the 
effects on the girls whose profiles were targeted. Knight stole the 
identity of one teenage girl – known to one of the victims – by hacking 
into her Facebook page.

She has now had to change schools because of the stigma attached to what happened, despite being entirely blameless.

Knight’s father said last night that the family had disowned the paedophile.

‘What Francis did is disgusting and 
will cause long-term damage to his victims,’ he said at his terraced 
home in Havant, Hampshire.

‘Every member of the family condemns what he did and we want nothing more to do with him.

‘He
should have been jailed for longer – I understand one of the families 
involved may be appealing for this and we wish them good luck.’

Knight
pleaded guilty to 17 offences at a hearing in April which involved 14 
counts of inciting children to engage in sexual activity, two counts of 
making indecent images of children and one count of attempting to incite
children to engage in sexual activity.

Detectives
from a specialist paedophile unit had interviewed all those who had 
been contacted by Knight. Around half were from Hampshire with the rest 
from Manchester.

Detective 
Sergeant Richard Wheeler, of Portsmouth CID, said: ‘I would like to 
praise the children who have shown courage throughout this investigation
and provided evidence to form the basis of the prosecution case.’
