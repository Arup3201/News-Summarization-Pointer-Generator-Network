The mother the 11-year-old Ohio girl who allegedly beat her friend's infant daughter to death is speaking out, saying she's heartbroken. 

On Wednesday, medical examiners said Zuri Whitehead had blunt force injuries all over her tiny body - including her head, neck, torso, arms and legs.

Following the autopsy, Cuyahoga County coroners ruled the little girl's death a homicide.

The attorney for the 11-year-old has asked for a mental evaluation to determine whether she is psychologically fit to stand trial

Reached by phone Wednesday, the 11-year-old's mother said she was devastated and added: 'My heart is broken, that's all I can say.'

Zuri's mother Trina Whitehead says she is best friends with the mother of the 11-year-old. She said she always thought the accused murder was a 'sweet girl.'

The girl and her mother reportedly asked to have Zuri sleep over at their home in the Cleveland suburb of Wickliffe to give Ms Whitehead a rest from the new baby. She is the mother of three other children. 

Ms Whitehead also said that if she had not completely trusted the girl, she would never have allowed Zuri to spend the night there.

The 11-year-old's attorney has asked for a psychiatric evaluation of the girl to determine whether she's competent to stand trial. 

Wickliffe Police Chief Randy Ice told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the girl had no history of mental illness. 

However, administrators at Wickliffe Middle School referred the girl to police twice for violence at school. 

Zuri was found with blunt force injuries all over her body - on her torso, head, neck, arms and legs
