Nani wept with emotion after scoring an outrageous 30-yard goal for Sporting Lisbon in their 2-0 over Gil Vicente on Sunday. 

The Portugal winger, on loan from Manchester United, controlled a throw-in with his head and then unleashed a vicious, dipping shot which flew into the top corner midway through the second half. 

The 28-year-old was overcome and in tears as he was mobbed by his team-mates.

It was all a bit much for Nani as he started to fill up...

You could see it in his eyes as he looked up after his goal for Sporting

'It was a goal like any other,' he told reporters. 'I received the ball, saw the goal, shot and I was lucky.'

'I thought about myself and everything that I have gone through,' added Nani, who was born in Cape Verde and had a tough upbringing in Lisbon after his family emigrated to Portugal. 'It's personal stuff, that nobody knows about.'

Junya Tanaka had opened Sporting's account when he bundled the ball home with his thigh following a corner early in the second half.

Scotland Under 21 international Ryan Gauld, who joined from Dundee United last summer, came off the bench for Sporting in the second half.

Sporting are third in the table with 47 points, nine behind Benfica who beat Moreirense 3-1 away on Saturday. Second-placed Porto (49) face Boavista on Monday.

Nani has been in tears on the pitch before - crying after a Jamie Carragher tackle when Liverpool beat Manchester United 3-1 at Anfield in 2011.

Carragher sent an apology to the United dressing room immediately after the match and then waited to offer his personal remorse.

Nani, who missed one game, said at the time: 'When I saw my leg for the first time, I thought my season was finished,' he said. 'That is why I was crying.'
