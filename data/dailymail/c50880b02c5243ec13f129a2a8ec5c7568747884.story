Peter Piot says it took '1,000 dead Africans' for the WHO to declare the Ebola outbreak an emergency

The scientist who discovered Ebola has slammed the World Health Organisation for taking too long to declare state of emergency over the recent outbreak in West Africa.

Peter Piot said it took '1,000 dead Africans' before the WHO took the Ebola outbreak seriously, wasting precious time before acting appropriately.

The Belgian microbiologist say that although the WHO knew about the outbreak three months after it started, it took them a further two months to declare a state of emergency.

Professor Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in north west Zaire in 1976. 

'It took three months for the WHO to find out there was an Ebola outbreak, that I understand. Guinea had a poor laboratory infrastructure,' he said in an interview with Talk to Al Jazeera, due to be aired on Saturday.

'I have much more of a problem with the fact that it took five months for WHO, for the international health regulations committee, for that's what it is, to declare this a state of emergency.

'It took 1,000 dead Africans and two Americans who were repatriated to the US because they were infected. 

'There's no excuse for that. It took too long; we wasted too much precious time.'

 In October, the professor warned that the Ebola crisis had spiralled 'out of control'.

Having waited too long to act, he believes the international community has then over-reacted in unhelpful ways.

He added: 'There is an epidemic of Ebola in West Africa and then there is a second epidemic, an epidemic of mass hysteria that we saw particularly in North America. It was really out of proportion with the issue. 

Tragedy: The Ebola epidemic, the worst since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives in West Africa, and 15 in other countries

Critique: Professor Piot,  who was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in north west Zaire in 1976, said 'there's no excuse' for the length of time it took the WHO to act, and that they 'wasted precious time'

In October, the professor warned that the Ebola crisis had spiralled 'out of control' and that the crisis is unlikely to come to a halt until a vaccine is available to immunise the population. . 

'In theory Ebola is very easy to control, but it has got completely out of hand,' he said, speaking at a seminar at Oxford University in October.

 'This is no longer an epidemic, it is a humanitarian crisis.' 

While he predicted the epidemic could be over by this time next year, he said it will take years to help reconstruct the countries devastated by the virus.

WHO recently claimed that around 6,000 people had died of the virus since the outbreak begun - and not 7,000 as was previously reported.

All but around 15 of those deaths have hit the three countries at the heart of the crisis in West Africa - Guinea, where the outbreak began last December, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Taking action: U.S. President Barack Obama tours a lab with Dr. Nancy Sullivan to discuss Ebola while he visits the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland on Tuesday

Professor Piot claims solutions need to address not just the lack of healthcare systems in place in these countries but the local population’s cultural habits and belief systems.

He highlights that some parts of West Africa have a habit of touching the dead at funerals - while others may believe in ‘witchcraft.’

He adds: 'The concept of an infectious agent is not always there. People may think it's witchcraft or a case of "someone wanted me to die".

'You need people who speak the language, who understand the culture, who know what people think and feel.'

According to revised data, published this week by the WHO, the worst Ebola epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives.

Following Monday's correction, the WHO said that as of November 28, Guinea had recorded 2,155 cases and 1,312 deaths, Liberia saw 7,635 cases and 3,145 deaths while Sierra Leone reported 7,109 cases and 1,530 deaths.

There have also been 15 fatalities in other countries, bringing the total to 6,002.
