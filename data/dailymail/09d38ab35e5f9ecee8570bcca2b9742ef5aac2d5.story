The chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage is at its lowest since the 1970s, figures reveal.

The number who become victims of the ‘seven-year itch’ and end their marriage at that point has dropped by a fifth in the past 15 years alone.

The fall in divorce among couples married for a decade or less is largely behind the overall increase in the stability of marriage, the figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest.

Happily ever after: The chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage has fallen to its lowest since the 1970s, new marriage breakdown figures have shown

Reasons: Men now mainly marry out of choice - rather than the family pressure which often used to push many into a wedding - and so are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives, researchers believe

Analysts
 say the popularity of living together has meant that men who eventually
 decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families 
than their fathers were.

They
 now mainly marry out of choice – rather than as a result of the family 
 pressure that pushed many into marriage in the past. This means they 
are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives, researchers 
believe.

The figures also revealed that divorces are now less likely to be initiated by wives.

The
 first decade of marriage is the toughest for most couples, with 
break-ups most likely in this period. The chances of staying together 
rise sharply after the 10th anniversary.

However, the latest figures show the divorce rate gradually dropping for couples in those most challenging first years together.

The
 chance of a couple who married in 2005 divorcing by 2012 is now 14 per 
cent, down from  17 per cent for those who wed  in the late 1980s and 
much of  the 1990s.

Risk: Couples are most likely to break up in the first decade of their marriage, and their chances of staying together rise sharply after the 10th anniversary

The 
seven-year-itch break-up rate, which rose fast after the liberalisation 
of divorce laws in the early 1970s, was last at 14 per cent between 1978
 and 1981.

A couple who 
married in 2005 were around a fifth less likely to divorce by 2012 than 
those whose weddings were in 1991, the peak year for divorce.

However,
 the ONS figures do not include marriages that take place abroad – for 
example, on holidays – and some analysts calculate that if these were 
taken into account, couples are now a quarter less likely to part within
 seven years.

The number of 
wives petitioning for divorce has fallen by more than a third since the 
early 1990s, according to the ONS. In 2012, women initiated 76,490 
divorces, down from more than 106,000 as recently as 2003. By contrast, 
the number of divorces stemming from petitions by husbands has remained 
at between 40,000 and 45,000 a year since 1980.

Some
 researchers believe the change has happened because women are much less
 likely to  find themselves betrayed or abandoned by their husbands.

Living together: Analysts say the popularity of cohabitation has meant that men in particular who do finally decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families than their fathers were

Harry
 Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘As cohabitation has become 
more and more accepted over the past 20 years, family pressure on men to
 get married has reduced.

‘Couples
 are no longer being told they must do the right  thing. As a result, 
the couples who decide to marry are the  most committed.’

He
 added: ‘The decision to buy into a marriage is very important for men. 
Men are more committed to their marriage and wives are happier. You can 
see this in the rates at which wives and husbands are petitioning for 
divorce.

‘There is a long-term decline in divorces started by wives, while the rate for husbands is absolutely flat.’

ONS
 analysts also suggest that the increase in couples living together 
before marriage in recent years may be a factor in declining divorce.

‘Cohabitation
 is often a precursor to marriage and may act to filter out weaker 
relationships from progressing to marriage,’ a report says.

Couples
 getting married when they are older may be also be a factor. ‘The age 
at first marriage has been increasing, and previous research has shown 
that those marrying at older ages have a lower risk of divorce,’  the 
report says.
