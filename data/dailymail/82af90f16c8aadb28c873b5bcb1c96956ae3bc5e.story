Tragedy: Schoolboy Laurence who drowned in a lake during his half-term holiday. His parents raised the alarm when he failed to return home with his grandmother

The parents of a six-year-old boy who drowned during an outing to feed the ducks with his grandmother have spoken for the first time of their heartbreak.

Schoolboy Laurence Mullany-Mills and Dawn Mullany, 71, drowned in a freezing lake during a half-term day out together.

Asmina Mullany-Mills and her husband Vaughan said the double tragedy had left 'a hole in our lives that can never be filled' as they spoke out for the first time.

The couple raised the alarm when Laurence and his grandmother failed to return home. Police later found Mrs Mullany's house empty and her car left near the duck pond in Holywell, Lincolnshire.

Their bodies were later pulled from the lake. Police believe that Laurence may have accidentally fallen into the water before his grandmother jumped in to help him.

However, as no one witnessed the incident it will never be known what actually happened.

Asmina and Vaughan, both 41, said in a statement: 'Dawn was adored by all. She was a great friend, a loving mother and above all, a doting and devoted grandmother. Her passion and affection for life will never be forgotten.

'Laurence was a gentle and caring brother to Nancy. He was a son with a wonderfully infectious smile who could warm the coldest place or light the darkest room.

'He had a limitless, bristling and bubbly enthusiasm for the new, and a burning curiosity to get involved with everything and anything, whether taking to the stage or the rugby field.'

They added that their son - also known as Laurie - had a 'special relationship' with his grandmother who lived nearby.

Dawn Mullany lived in Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire, two miles away from the lake where he drowned.

She was due to take him back to his home in Ketton, Rutland, on Thursday last week, but they never made it.

The
boy's parents added: 'Laurie and Dawn could not have been closer as 
grandmother and grandson. At the core of their special relationship was a
shared love of fun and laughter.

'Their
death leaves a hole in our lives that can never be filled. We will all 
have our own happy and special memories of the two of them, and we will 
ensure these memories never fade but burn more brightly than ever 
before.

'We have been moved by the many tributes
and messages of kindness we have received and understand that our 
tragedy has touched the lives of so many, including those outside our 
family and circle of friends.

'We wish to express our most sincere gratitude and thanks to our family, friends and the community for, their gifts, their support and their love during this most testing of times.

'We, their family and friends are going to need time and above all space. Time and space will help us to take the small steps that will enable us to move forward as a family. These small steps will, over time, allow us to focus on the knowledge and love of what we had, and not what we have lost.'

The couple also have a daughter who is 15 months old. Laurence was a pupil at Ketton Church of England Primary School.

The family had recently returned from a holiday in New Zealand to spend Christmas with Vaughan's family.

Mrs Mullany was described by her 
neighbours as ‘a sweet, lovely lady’ who had lived in the village of 
Castle Bytham,  Lincolnshire, for around 30 years.

They
told how she had suffered tragedy in her life, including the death of 
her father in wartime action in 1943 when she was a baby.

In 1977, her husband, Firozali, died aged just 35.

A joint funeral for the boy and his grandmother is due to take place next week.

The double death is not being treated as suspicious and the death is now being investigated by the coroner.
