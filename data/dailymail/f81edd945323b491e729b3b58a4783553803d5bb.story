A new series of images provide food-for-thought when it comes to the future of some of America's most populated coastal towns.

Nickolay Lamm, 24, has produced some worrying illustrations of how California's biggest cities will become lost to the ocean if scientists' predictions of 
the effects of global warming prove correct.

San Francisco, becomes consumed by the very bay it is constructed next to. Venice Beach resembles scenes from Venice, Italy as the Pacific Ocean slowly deluges the trendy Los Angeles neighborhood. And San Diego's position as a naval town is virtually washed away as the unforgiving sea water floods the towns docks and promenades.

Venice, California: Today, Venice is known for its canals, beaches and circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only promenade

Venice of America: Venice Beach would have more in common with its Italian namesake if the sea levels rise 12 feet as shown here

Submarine required: Venice Beach has long since disappeared in this shocking vision of the future after sea levels rise by 25 feet

Drowning slowly: Even at a 5-foot rise in sear level, the beach is able to keep the rising Pacific at bay and life continues as normal

With a rise in sea levels of 12-feet, the famous beach and its promenade is all but washed away

Sufin' USA: You might need a surfboard more than a skateboard to get around parts of Venice in the year 2500!

It could take several centuries for sea 
levels to rise to that level but artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm hopes his work will raise public 
awareness about the very real threat of global warming today.

Mr Lamm used data and methods from Climate Central, an independent organization of leading scientists and journalists researching and reporting the facts about the changing climate and its impact on the American public.

Nickolay interpreted Climate Central's sea level rise maps and flood elevation formula to arrive at these images

'Sea
 level rise that makes cities uninhabitable is not going to happen in 
our lifetime, but, it is going to happen sooner or later unless we cut 
carbon emissions. Our first sea level rise project covered only East 
Coast cities. I felt it would be fitting to bring attention to sea level
 rise on the West Coast as well,' he says.

The City by the Bay: AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team is already perched perilously close to the bay from which the city earns its nickname

Fancy a swim? Just 12 feet of water turns the baseball stadium into an open-air swimming pool as the bay begins to consume the city

According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate 
Change, the seas will rise by an average of 6.6 feet by 2100.

Then over the coming centuries, as temperatures rise and ice sheets melt, the oceans could rise as much as 20 or 30 feet.

Lamm
 has created images which show famous cities will look like 
under 5 feet (projected increase over the next 100 to 300 years), 12 
feet (potential level in 2300), and 25 feet (the potential level in 
coming centuries) of water.

The
 U.S. National Climate Assessment report notes that of an increase in 
average U.S. temperatures of about 1.5 degrees F since 1895, when 
reliable national record-keeping began, more than 80 percent had 
occurred in the past three decades.

With heat-trapping gases already in 
the atmosphere, temperatures could rise by a further 2 to 4 degrees F in
 most parts of the country over the next few decades, the report said.

Sand bags required: Waterfront views are all around as the San Diego water level rises 5 feet higher than present-day levels

Lost City: San Diego appears to have more in common with Atlantis in this picture of how things might look in 500 years time

San Diego, 25-feet down: This once pretty park is now more suited to divers than dog-walkers!

Golden Gate Rust: Beautiful Crissy Field Center, part of the Golden Gate National Park, as it looks today

Waterfront views: The resulting illustrations give us a sobering glimpse into our potential future

Darling it's better, down where it's wetter... or maybe not as this picture shows San Franciso 12-feet under

Beautiful: Crissy Field and the San Francisco skyline. The remaining structures of the former Coast Guard Station are in the foreground

Crissy, 5-feet below: As global sea level rises, coastal cities and islands face a growing risk of being washed away

A vision of the future: Under 25 feet of water, there's not much left of the old Crissy Field

Clean and dry: With a 5-foot change in sea level, very little has altered and life continues as normal

San Diego, 25-feet-under: Lamm used sea level rise maps from Climate Central to create a formula to calculate how much water there would be on the ground in a specific location
