A fire broke out at the apartment where Anne Frank lived before she went into hiding from the Nazis, it was reported today.

Firefighters were called last night to the block on Merwedeplein in Amsterdam  where the teenage diarist lived between 1934 and 1942.

According to the city's fire department, the occupant of the apartment was not at home when the small fire started.

A neighbour managed to extinguish it but had to be taken to hospital due to inhaling smoke. Thanks to him the damage to the building was limited.

Anne lived almost eight years on the second floor of the Merwedeplein apartment before she went in hiding in 1942.

The only surviving moving footage of her was taken there showing her leaning out of a window.

Anne moved three miles away to the Achterhuis, which is now a museum called the Anne Frank House dedicated to her and the Holocaust, on the Prinsengracht with her family in July of that year.

In 2004, the apartment on the Merwedeplein was made available to foreign writers who cannot freely write in their own countries to take shelter.

Anne wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II.

The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933.

By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped.

In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building.

But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945.

Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame.
