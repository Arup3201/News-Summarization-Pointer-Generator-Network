A father-of-two will celebrate his first Christmas since 1994 after a brain injury wiped out 17 years of memories.

Gary Rogers, 43, did not even recognise his own daughters after suffering a heart attack and being left in a coma while on holiday.

The cardiac arrest left him with memory loss, caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain.

Now, after months of hard work trying to re-build his life, he is preparing to celebrate the first Christmas he will remember after he woke up thinking it was 1994.

He will spend December 25 with his wife Linda, who is now his full-time carer, and daughters Olivia, 18, and Lilly, 15, at their home in Basildon, Essex.

The brain damage which wiped out 17 years of his life happened while he was on holiday in Turkey last summer. His wife said it has been a long re-building process since he woke up in a British hospital last September.

'Although some of Gary’s memories from longer ago have returned, he struggles to remember anything about the last year, or the two years leading up to his heart attack,' said Mrs Rogers.

'But now, he is beginning to remember important things that happen - and hopefully this Christmas will really be one to remember.

'Last year, Gary was crying in the run-up to Christmas because he knew he used to love all our celebrations - but couldn’t remember much about them, and knew he would struggle to remember the day once it had passed.

'We took loads of family photos to document the whole day - but by Boxing day, Gary couldn’t remember anything.

'This year, his memory is much better, and we’re really looking forward to a lovely, memorable day together.'

Gary, who used to work in building maintenance, was put in a medically induced coma after falling ill on holiday.

Doctors warned his devastated family he had suffered brain damage, caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain.

He remained in intensive care in Turkey until he was well enough to be flown home to the Essex Cardiothoracic Centre, where doctors woke him.

Linda said the family realised just how badly his brain had been damaged in the following days.

'I asked him what year it was, and he said 1994 - he was dumbfounded when I said it was 2010, she said.

'I had to stay strong for the girls and Gary, but inside I was broken. The girls were crushed, knowing that their dad didn’t have a clue who they were. But we had to stick together and keep fighting. We knew we’d pull through it as a family.

'When Gary came home, Olivia had to show him round the house - it was like he was seeing everything for the first time.

'He didn’t know where things were kept, and didn’t recognise any clothes in his wardrobe. It was absolutely awful.

'After we’d shown Gary round the house, he turned to me and said "thanks for letting me stay."

'I was devastated. I told him it was his home, but he turned to me and said: "You’re not my wife - we’ve split up, haven’t we? I’m married to someone else now."

'I tried not to show Gary how upset I was. I told him we’d been married for 25 years and had never been apart.

'He said this woman was a bit like me, but different - we think he was confusing me now with how I looked when we first got married - but it was horrible to hear him say it.'

She added that in the days after he woke up he had a 'blank look' on his face and had no idea he was a father-of-two.

Linda said: 'I started to talk to him about our 
daughters - but he just looked at me blankly. I showed him pictures of 
them, hoping he would recognise them - but he just shrugged.

'I desperately tried to get him to remember - but his memories were so vague, he couldn’t remember anything about them.

'I was devastated. When the girls came to see their dad, he just stared at them blankly - he didn’t recognise them.

Slowly, Gary’s long term memory has started to return - after a lot of help from his family.

Linda and his daughters bought him a diary, to help him remember what he had done - and even made a tick-chart for him so he could cross off certain tasks, like brushing his teeth.

Linda added: 'Gary’s memory is still hazy, and he doesn’t remember anything at all for the 18 months leading up to his heart attack.

'He has vague memories of the past, but there are still some things that he has no recollection of.

'When we were watching the Royal Wedding, he suddenly shouted: "Princess Diana’s dead!"

'It’s been a long journey, and there is still a long way to go, but we know Gary loves us, and we will always have each other.

'Gary could have died that day - so we consider ourselves very lucky. We’re working towards getting our normal life back.

'We just want the simple life - and a family Christmas that we can all have some treasured memories is our wish come true.'

Gary added: 'I don’t remember last Christmas at all or any before without the help of Linda reminding me about them and it is all very vague.

'I am hoping to remember this Christmas and the way I look at it is that I will be with my beautiful girls and loving, caring wife, family and friends and that is what is important.'
