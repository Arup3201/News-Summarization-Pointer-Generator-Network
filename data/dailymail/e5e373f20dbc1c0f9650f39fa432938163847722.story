A man who raided a betting shop was brought to justice today… because of his eyebrows.

Paul Shough, 28, was jailed for six-and-a-half years after threatening staff at a Coral store in Birmingham with an imitation gun, and managed to escape with £200 in cash.

He had covered his face before attempting the crime, but police were able to track him down thanks to his distinctive eyebrows and heavily-lined forehead.

Shough pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm at an earlier hearing.

CCTV footage from the robbery shows Shough walking in to the shop and approaching staff with what looked like a gun covered with a white plastic bag.

He was wearing a black hoodie and had a scarf around the lower half of his face, but his eyebrows were still clearly visible.

The distinctive feature allowed police to
find Shough after the robbery, which took place on 30 April this year.

Thanks to the image being circulated, a local police officer recognised Shough's face, which led to him being charged with robbery on 4 May.

Detective Constable Damian Forrest, from West Midlands Police CID, said: ‘We are pleased with the sentence.

‘Although no-one was physically injured during the robbery, the staff at Coral believed Shough was carrying a weapon in the bag and were left deeply traumatised by the experience.

‘They believed they would be shot if they didn’t do as he demanded.

‘There was absolutely no doubt it was our man. His distinctive eyebrows and lines on his forehead gave him away.’
