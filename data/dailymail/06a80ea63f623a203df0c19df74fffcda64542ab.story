A man whose jaw was broken in a random attack by a stranger said today he was targeted for having ginger hair.

Alex Kosuth-Phillips, 23, who was celebrating his birthday with his girlfriend, had to have surgery and metal plates inserted into his jaw following the assault in Selly Oak, Birmingham.

Today he claimed that his attacker, who approached him in a pizza restaurant, swore at him and called him a 'ginger p****' before punching him in the face.

'It was traumatic then and it's traumatic now': Mr Kosuth-Phillips says the attack was entirely unprovoked

The sales assistant from Chester, who was visiting his student girlfriend in Birmingham when he was attacked on February 25 last year, had to live off coleslaw and mashed potato for three months and lost two stone.

He said: 'I had been out celebrating my birthday with my girlfriend, and we went into the shop to order a pizza.

'All I remember is walking into the pizza parlour and there were two of them [the attacker and his friend] sat on the left hand side.

'One of them said something to my girlfriend, I asked what he said and he started swearing, becoming abusive and mocking my ginger hair.'

'He swore at me and called me a "ginger pr**k".'

'I said I didn't need it and I was leaving.  All I remember was opening the door and the next thing I knew I was in hospital, where I had to have two lots of surgery.

Brutal: The CCTV footage shows the force of the punch that broke Mr Kosuth-Phillips' jaw

Police are appealing for anyone who recognises the man, pictured, to come forward

Mr Kosuth-Phillips had spent the 
evening at the Gatecrasher nightclub in Birmingham city centre before stopping for 
pizza with his girlfriend at around 1am.

This week he watched footage of the attack for the first time, and said: 'I had not been allowed to see the CCTV 
of the attack until last week and it was a bit hard-hitting.

'It's the first time that I have seen both of my parents cry.  It was traumatic at the time and it's traumatic now.

'I walked out of the takeaway, to try to defuse the situation, but I saw him following me out of the corner of my eye.

'He punched me and I fell to the floor. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.

'I could have hit my head on the floor and had brain damage or even died.

'I suffered a fractured jaw in one place and it had snapped in half at the front. I lost a few teeth as well.

'Even now I can't eat meat and get quite a lot of pain - it hurts when people hug me.

'I went through a depressed stage after the attack. I just don't understand why someone would do that.

'You can see in the video he 
appears to be trained to box - he knew what he was doing.  I just hope 
someone recognises him and can help catch him.'

'It's just not fair that people go 
around doing this kind of thing: they show no care for what they have 
done and they show no remorse.

'I hope the person who did it hands himself in, or someone who knows him calls the police.

'People assume that you get knocked out and jump back up, but it's not the case.'

West Midlands Police released CCTV footage which clearly 
shows the victim backing away from his attacker - as the thug pulls back
his arm and punches him square in the face - sending the victim flying 
onto the pavement.

Detective Constable Louise Corcoran, 
from West Midlands Police CID, said: 'This was a serious unprovoked 
assault which left an innocent man knocked out cold and requiring 
surgery.

'The offender walked into the shop and made an offensive comment to him before hitting him in the face.

'It's had a lasting effect on the victim, who has been left physically and emotionally scarred by the assault.

'We need to catch the person responsible and ensure justice is done.'

The CCTV footage shows how even after the man has been knocked 
out and is lying on the floor, the attacker carries on gesticulating to 
another man who comes out of the Pizza Land takeaway.

The man is white, with short dark hair and was wearing a black and white patterned T-shirt with black collar, dark trousers and dark trainers.

Anyone who recognises the man should call Force CID on 101.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
