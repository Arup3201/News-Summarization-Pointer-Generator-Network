A man who lost his leg in a horror crash is being evicted from his rented home by his own father.

Ashley Willoughby, 26, of Rochester, Kent, suffered a serious brain injury when he hit a lamppost and road sign while riding his motorcycle - and had to have his left leg amputated.

After 14 operations he began the road to recovery with the help of a carer. But he has been unable to work and can no longer afford to pay his full rent to his father Graham, 48, who owns the flat.

He was presented with a formal eviction notice at an official meeting, reading: ‘It is with much regret that I have to serve you with two months’ notice by virtue of Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988.’

The letter, dated April 28, added: ‘The notice will end on June 29, 2014. Please return all keys, including outbuildings, on June 29, 2014. Yours sincerely, Graham Willoughby.’

Ashley Willoughby told MailOnline today: ‘It’s disgusting. Everything was going fine between myself and my father until I moved into the house I’m in, and then everything went pear-shaped.

‘I've been living in this house for three years. I've personally tried building bridges with him a few times - “do you fancy going out for a pint”, and he's busy every single weekend.

‘I'm not being defiant - I'm just 
going to sit tight. This is my grandparents' house - it's my dad's 
inheritance. It’s been in the family for over 40 years. My dad was 
brought up in it.’

Property: The road on which the home (pictured) is located has an average house value of £179,000

His rent 
is £625 a month, although he only has to pay about two-thirds of this to
 his bricklayer father each month. That is because his father receives 
around £200 a month from the council.

Ashley
 Willoughby added: ‘I didn't know what the [official] meeting was about, but a 
third of the way through the penny dropped. I said “you're evicting me”.
 He said he wasn't and I said “you are, there's no other way around it".'

The
 son admitted that his relationship with his father deteriorated before 
his accident last July, but insisted he had always paid his rent in 
full.

But he now faces the 
prospect of becoming homeless - although his employers said they will 
keep his job open until he is fit to return.

He added: ‘You want to come back somewhere where you feel comfortable and safe. At the moment it's the opposite. I'm just sitting tight and waiting. I can't understand what he's up to.’

Ashley Willoughby, who has two brothers, is still waiting to find out how much benefit he is entitled to - and fears he will not get enough money to be able to afford a new place.

He said he was determined to return to his old job as an electrician, despite his new disability.

Ashley Willoughby said: ‘With my job you need to be active. You've got to be crawling around and up ladders reaching for things. I won't be able to do it like I did before, I'll have to make adaptations - but there's nothing holding me back. Nothing will stop me.’

The road on which the home - originally owned by his late grandparents Kathleen and Gordon - is located has an average house value of £179,000.

Graham Willoughby refused to comment to a local newspaper. He has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.
