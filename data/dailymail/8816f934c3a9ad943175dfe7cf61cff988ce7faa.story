A brother and sister have unique memories to cherish after they were married in an unusual double wedding.

While most people want their families to share in their special day, siblings Alison and Jon have taken familial involvement to the next level.

Alison Baker, 46, married Martin Baker, 43, immediately before her brother Jon Merrett, 39, married Kate Merrett, 46, in a joint celebration attended by hundreds of friends and family members.

The siblings (Jon and Alison, far right) say they were happy to share their special day, which included a lavish reception in a converted barn (pictured)

Alison said: 'The venue was perfect 
and the day was wonderful. I was incredibly lucky to be able to share 
the experience with my brother.

'I
 didn’t mind sharing the limelight. It could have made for a recipe for 
disaster, but after everything, I can’t imagine how we could have done 
it in a better way.'

Alison,
 who works in agricultural equipment sales, and Martin, a delivery 
driver, became engaged in the winter of 2011 and began planning their 
wedding immediately.

Jon,
 an engineer, had been engaged to Kate for nearly 18 years by the time 
he accompanied his sister on a day out to visit a local wedding venue.

Alison, of Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, said: 'When I saw the barn, I realised I had found my perfect wedding venue, but I knew I’d never be able to afford it.

'That’s when Jon suggested we have a double wedding, and split the cost. I checked that Kate was happy with the idea before agreeing. I was touched that they were willing to do that for us.'

Kate, a purchasing administrator, said: 'Jon had always been nervous about being the centre of attention at our wedding, so this was a perfect solution for us.

'This way, we could all celebrate together.'

The two couples set up a joint bank account and pooled their resources to afford the day’s luxuries, which included a horse-drawn carriage.

Alison and Kate even bought their wedding dresses from the same shop after a joint fitting session.

The two couples were married on August 24th 2013 at St Mary’s church in rural Frampton on Severn, with a reception at a nearby converted barn.

Alison said: 'Some of my friends wondered how I could share my special day. They told me they wouldn’t be able to cope with someone seeing their dress and sharing the planning before their wedding.

'I’m not that kind of person. For me, the happiness of my friends and family comes first. They make me who I am, and I didn’t feel as if I was giving anything up. In fact, it felt as if I was gaining so much more than I could ever have dreamed of.

'As the day got nearer, I became more determined that Kate had her perfect day. I wanted her to be just as happy as me.

'It was amazing for our dad John and our mum Marilyn to see their son and daughter married on the same day.'

Alison and Martin exchanged their vows first, followed by Jon and Kate. Martin’s son James, 13, acted as Martin’s best man while his daughter Sophie, 16, was bridesmaid for Alison.

Jon and Kate’s sons Damon, 14, and William, 11, also played key parts, with Damon acting as Jon’s best man and William giving Kate away.

Alison and Jon’s father John, 73, sang at the celebration as a member of the Gloucestershire Police Male Voice Choir.

At the reception, Jon and Kate took to the dancefloor first to dance to Aerosmith’s I Don’t Want Miss a Thing, before Alison and Martin danced to Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston’s It Takes Two.

Alison said: 'I wish I could relive that day every day. It was such fun. I feel as if I’ve gained not only a husband but a renewed friendship with my brother and his amazing wife.'

The two couples are now planning a joint honeymoon in Florida which they hope to undertake next year.
