Tragic: Alison Holman, 34, was found dead on May 7 in her home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester

A young mother hanged herself in a drunken 'cry for help' after her addiction to red wine destroyed her ten-year marriage and saw her separated from her sons, aged five and nine.

NHS worker Alison Holman, 34, was found dead on May 7 in her home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, with empty bottles of wine strewn about the property.

The health improvement officer had split with her husband in November 2013 after her drinking habit became out of control - she would often finish two bottles of wine in one evening, an inquest heard.

Despite managing to hold down her job as a health improvement officer, instructing volunteers and teaching disabled children, she was unable to curb her addiction.

At a hearing in Stockport, a coroner ruled that Mrs Holman was too drunk to have intentionally taken her own life.

Afterwards her mother Julie Iddon said: 'It's just very sad and was a cry for help because Alison had clearly crossed that fine line of being able to quit drinking at will.

'People need to know even more about the dangers of drinking and how it can affect you. I wish I knew the answer to what she was thinking but I don't. 

I just always believed she didn't intend to take her own life so I'm pleased that's come out at the inquest.'

Mrs Holman's habit began when she started drinking a glass of wine every night after work, claiming that it helped with work-related stress - an issue she saw her doctor about in 2007.

Then in 2012 she was referred by her GP for depression after admitting that she had been drinking excessively since 2008.

In July 2013 she was seen by the alcohol liaison service and split up with her husband later that year. 

Mr Holman, a software developer, said: 'We separated in about November 2013. Part of the reason was her drinking had increased. She was drinking a lot. 

'Cry for help':  Mrs Holman's devastated mother, Julie Iddon, said at the inquest into her daughter's death: 'People need to know even more about the dangers of drinking and how it can affect you' 

'That had been the case for quite a long time. It got to the stage that when she got home from work she would have one or two bottles of wine per night. 

'The separation had not been intended to be permanent but things became more difficult.'

He said he last saw her for lunch on May 7, the day she died, where 'her frame of mind was fine' and she was excited about going on a training course with work. 

But later he received a phone call from a friend telling him to go round to see her. 

Mr Holman added: 'She had been saying she wanted to kill herself. I rang her straight away and it was hazy but I got the impression she wanted to kill herself.

'She was saying she was going to kill herself and I was saying "you have two lovely kids, why would you even do that?"

'She was saying "they don't need me". I decided to go round with the kids but at that point she did manage to convince me she was fine and I didn't need to go round. 

'She assured me she was fine and she was going to bed.'

The hearing was told how Mrs Holman began a relationship with NHS volunteer Wayne Oldham after he met her on a course she was taking. On the day she died the couple had been in an argument over her helping him with his CV. 

Mr Oldham said that he left her home on May 7, aware that she had drunk two bottles of wine, and that he did not speak to her for the rest of the evening - leaving his phone on silent. 

Addiction: Mrs Holman was said to be drinking up to two bottles of red wine every night when her husband left her in November 2013

When he woke the following day he had 11 missed calls and eight texts from Mrs Holman with one at 5.31pm saying: 'Considering the best way to kill myself.'

Mr Oldham added: 'I just thought they were drunk texts.' 

Angela Lockley a close friend of Mrs Holman, also had contact with her on the day she died.

She said: 'She put a Facebook status saying she was feeling down. I texted her saying "are you okay?" and she said "no, I want to die". 

'She said "everything" was wrong. I told her to focus on her children but she said "they don't want me, they want to be with their dad." I rang her and she was crying and seemed very drunk.'

Miss Lockley told Alison to go to hospital but she refused. They kept talking and soon the conversation was said to have eased off as the pair began laughing and joking. 

She added: 'She mentioned in the morning she had a session teaching a group with learning difficulties. I said "promise to call me in the morning on your way to work".' 

When Wayne Oldham was informed by the college that Mrs Holman had not turned up for work the day after their argument he decided to go round to the house.

When he got no answer at the door he climbed through a bathroom window and discovered her body.

Police later found an empty wine glass on her coffee table, an empty wine bottle by a bin and six other empty bottles in a kitchen cupboard. Tests showed Mrs Holman, who did not leave a suicide note, would have been three times over the drink drive limit.

Recording an open conclusion coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'The alcohol intoxication might well have been a contributing factor in her state of mind. We know she had some difficulties with the separation but she wasn't somebody who had a history of self-harm.

'I suspect the level of alcohol has contributed to the action she has taken. I'm not sure she intended to take her own life. She was having a very difficult time and feeling quite low and maybe it was a cry for help. I don't think there is the evidence to say she intended to die.

'I think this is a young woman under the influence who was having a very difficult time and feeling quite low and impulsively acted on those feelings resulting in her death. In a logical, more rational mind, she could see there was more to live for.'
