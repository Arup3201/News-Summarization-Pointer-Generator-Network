The romance of  journeying to your destination is clearly alive and well as these entries to a photographic competition entitled On The Road show.

The images from 400 submitted from all over the world were the  winners of a competition run by the Society of International Travel and Tourism Photographers.

And it was a civil engineer from Bristol who walked away with the top prize with his black and white shot of a car in the Eurotunnel.

Jonathan Millard, 37, said: 'My photo was taken en route to a skiing holiday this year to the French Alps with friends and our 10-month-old daughter...my first ride in the Eurotunnel.

'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective. It was the first of many holiday photos.'

American Jim Shepka, from Windham, New Hampshire, came second with his moody black and white shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, while third place was taken by another Brit, Chris Upton, who picked out an iconic yellow taxi from the walkway of Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

Chris, a travel and landscape photographer from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I enjoy photographing throughout the UK but have also been fortunate to have visited some inspirational locations around the world.

'The opportunity to visit these magical places, meet the people and observe their culture, traditions and landscape has been a wonderful experience.

'My goal is always to capture the spirit of this in my images and to create an emotion in the viewer to learn more or indeed visit these locations themselves'. 

First prize: 'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective,' said British photographer Jonathan Millard. Competition judge Phil Jones said, 'The very high standard made judging very difficult, but this  image caught the judges' eye with its leading lines, and the low camera angle gave greater feeling of connectivity to the 'road' which fitted nicely with the theme of the competition.'

Second prize: Jim Shepka was second placed for his moody shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, which was built in 1874

Runners up: 'I took this photo (left) whilst on my journey through Orissa, India in which I visited many tribal villages,' said Polish born Irena Sowinska. 'I encountered  children with a spontaneity and joyfulness that was very moving.' Right, third placed Chris Upton was also highly commended fort his image of a bike propped up against a coffee shop covered in number plates in Crested Butte, Colorado. 'I just happened to come across this bike while heading over to buy a cup of coffee,' he said.

Third place went to another Brit, Chris Upton, of an iconic yellow taxi on Brooklyn Bridge, New York. Chris, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The shutter speed was quite tricky as I wanted to get the right amount of motion in the cars but  avoid camera shake. It was then a question of waiting until a yellow cab came by...'

Highly recommended for this dramatic and colourful shot, Chris Upton's photograph of a lighthouse in Maine, the Pemaquid lighthouse also was picked out by the judges. 'It was taken at dawn and I composed the image using the rocks and the dawn sky to lead to the focal point of the image, the lighthouse,' said Chris of his amazing image

Commended: Californian Todd Arbini's 'Rolling green hills of Livermore.' The professional photographer said of this ethereal shot, 'I went for a drive on Morgan Territory Road which goes up the south west side of Mount Diablo [in California]. This view is looking back on the Livermore hills at dusk.'

Almost Turneresque: The quality of the light is striking in this photograph by Todd Arbini which was also commended. Both pictures were taken on travels round his home state of California, this one of a road disappearing off into the sunset at Brentwood.

Commended: Former Lancashire Evening Post photographer Georgina Brewster was also highly commended for her picture of the Houses of Parliament from the banks of the Thames. The 35 year old from Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, who now concentrates on weddings and lifestyle photographs, took her picture from the South Bank on a weekend break in London with her husband and seven year old daughter.

Commended:  Manuel Ramos from Santiago, Chile was highly commended for his 'on the road' shot going into a national park. The 37 year old architect said: 'This was taken on the road heading to Torres del Paine National Park, located in the Chilean Patagonia, Magallanes Province.'

Commended: Tamal Mitra, 25, from Kolkata, India got this evocative sunset shot from his home town. The Android game programmer said: 'Prinsep Ghat is a Ghat built during the British Raj, along the river bank of Hooghly and on its bank on Kolkata side. I was taking photographs there with my friends when I saw a couple who had hired a boat for a ride. The sun was setting  that time, and that produced an amazing silhouette.'
