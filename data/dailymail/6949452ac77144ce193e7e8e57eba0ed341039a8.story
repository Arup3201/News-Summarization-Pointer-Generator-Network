An angry mother has gone 'on strike' on the streets of North Carolina to protest against her two teenager daughters' 'disrespectful' and 'out of control' behavior.

Nassira Muhammad, who is a single mother to the girls, decided to take action when one them reportedly scratched a key against her brand new minivan at their home in Winston-Salem

With conventional discipline methods having previously failed, she created a huge sign reading: 'Mom On Strike!'. Then, she started marching up and down the street with the sign held high. 

Now, Ms Muhammad has been 'on strike' for a week - and seemingly has no plans to stop just yet.

'Mom On Strike!' Nassira Muhammad (pictured), who is a single mother to two teenage daughters, has gone 'on strike' on the streets of North Carolina to protest against the girls' 'disrespectful' and 'out of control' behavior

'I'm to the point where I'm just so frustrated, so to keep my hands off my kids or to keep me from doing something crazy, I just decided to go on strike,' she told WFMY.

'I walk up and down the sidewalk until my knees hurt, and then I sit down. This is the only solution I can think of other than getting rid of my children,'

Ms Muhammad, who opted for nearby Waughtown Street as her picket line, said her daughters have spent years disrespecting her, being rude and never saying thank you for what she does for them.

Punishments like time-outs and lectures had failed to alter their behavior, she said.

She added that she had even called the police on her daughters after her van was scratched up. But the officers reportedly told her they could not do anything without eyewitnesses, ABC reported. 

'My children have everything that they could possibly want and need, but yet still, they are disrespectful,' Ms Muhammad, who apparently started 'striking' last Friday, said.

'They are rude. They think that I'm the meanest mom in the world. They think they can survive without me, so I said, "you know what? That's fine. This mom is going on strike".'

And Ms Muhammad's actions may be having a positive influence on her daughters.

Earlier this week, the girls took to Waughtown Street themselves, armed with signs that their aunt had forced them to carry. On the signs were words of thanks to their mother.

They read: 'Thank you mom for providing for me, caring for me, and loving me.'

However, the pair are yet to make amends of their own accord.  

Speaking to WFMY, Dr Nannette Funderburk, a Psychotherapist at the Social and Emotional Learning Group in Greensboro, said parents often need a support system to help them out.

'This mom is definitely sending a message,' said Dr Funderburk. 'You need someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of because kids don't come with a manual.' 

Jill Weber, a psychologist at the American Psychological Association, added that the support system can be in the form of therapists, church groups, support groups and schools, among other things.

Getting support from others can then empower a mother or father to start setting simple, but firm limits for their offspring, Ms Weber said.

'The important thing is that you start with two to three absolute rules, and then stick by them and the consequences of not following them,' she said. 

'I've definitely seen similar situations, and I know with little changes in a family's day-to-day interactions, things can absolutely get better.'
