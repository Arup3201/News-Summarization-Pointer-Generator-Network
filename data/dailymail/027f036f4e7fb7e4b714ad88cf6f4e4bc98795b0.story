A young woman from a wealthy New York family, who was found dead at the bottom of a Manhattan stairwell, had been due to enter rehab following the collapse of her marriage, sources claimed.

Carlisle Brigham, 29, had suffered a 
massive wound to her neck, a shattered chin and compound fractures to 
her arms - possibly after tripping on her high heels following a night out to celebrate a friend's wedding.

Her father James Brigham, the city's former budget chief, was reportedly so concerned about her well-being following the collapse of her year-long marriage that he had flown in from St Louis to take his distraught daughter to a rehab facility.

He was believed to have spoken to her after landing at La Guardia airport at 9.30am on Monday and had planned to meet his daughter for lunch.

Before their estrangement: Carlisle Brigham and Anthony Champalimaud pose together. Ms Brigham died after what appears to be a tragic accident on the stairwell of the Manhattan apartment she was staying at

Ms Brigham was discovered, dressed all in white, lying in a pool of blood just before 11 am on Monday at the bottom of a treacherously steep stairwell in the Lower East Side. The severity of her injuries made investigators initially believe she had been 
murdered.

However, the New York City Chief Medical
examiner ruled that Ms Brigham, whose father is now the chairman of a St Louis investment bank, died in a tragic 'freak accident' after suffering blunt trauma to her head and neck.

Initial autopsy results were unclear whether alcohol may have played a role in her death.

According to the New York Post, the night before her death, Ms Brigham had returned from a  wedding in Washington D.C. and gone to Sixth Ward, a bar next door to the apartment where she had been staying.

Attending the wedding was difficult for her, her father told the New York Times, coming a week after her first wedding anniversary.

Ms Brigham married 34-year-old Anthony Lindley Champalimaud last year in Newport, Rhode Island but the couple were separated three months ago - although hoped to work out their relationship.

Talented: Ms Brigham was a skilled model maker at the Natural History Museum in New York

Tragic: Carlisle Brigham (with unidentified friends) died after a fall down stairs in a New York apartment building shortly before she was to meet her father for lunch

She was living in the Lower 
East Side with another man at the time of her death, believed 
to be old college friend John Madtes, because she had lost the keys 
to her own apartment.

Though neighbors performed CPR on her 
body, she was transported to Beth Israel Medical Center in an ambulance just before her father arrived at the apartment. The young woman was 
pronounced dead a short time later.

It is believed that a heavy bag and slippery stairs may have contributed to her fatal fall.

A spokesman for the medical examiner 
said that Ms Brigham did not bleed to death and her injuries were 
consistent with a heavy blow to her head and neck.

Late night: Ms Brigham had been at this bar with friends the night before her death after attending a weekend wedding in Washington D.C.

One resident of 191 Orchard St said that he attempted to perform CPR on Brigham but she was already dead when he found her.

'Her body was actually quite cold,' said 19-year-old Mizanur Rahman. 'The whole floor was just blood.

'I knew something had gone seriously wrong when I flipped her over. There was blood in nose, there was blood coming out of the mouth and a huge gash on her chin.'

Another resident Lippy Khair, 27, said: 'She was wearing all white. White top, white pants. And she had really high heels.'

Her father, James Brigham Jr., served 
as the New York City budget officer in the late 1970s before moving to 
St. Louis and turning to private equity at Warson Capital Partners in 
St. Louis.

Turmoil: Ms Brigham married her husband Anthony Champalimaud (right) last year but the couple was said to be estranged and he is thought to have been in London on business at the time of her death

Grief: James Brigham, a prominent investment banker, was on the way to meet his daughter for lunch after flying in from St Louis that morning

The former mayor of New York, Ed Koch, for whom James Brigham worked said that her grief-stricken father called him yesterday.

'He was sobbing,' said Koch to the New York Post. 'He told me that she had died and that it was apparently a fall...a freak accident.

'Wonderful young woman. I just was overwhelmed with grief and still am.'

Ms Brigham's estranged husband Mr Champalimaud works for a hotel design firm run by his mother and
was in London on business when his wife was found.

Mr Champalimaud 
is the vice president of YLT Hotels and Properties and has a leading 
role in the operations at the five-star Gainsborough Hotel in Bath, 
England.

Scene: Ms Brigham was staying at 191 Orchard Street - slippery stairs and a heavy bag may have contributed to her fall

Distraught: The roommate who was living with Ms Brigham in the Lower East Side apartment building said that he got a phone call from the 29-year-old Monday morning and she 'sounded distraught'

Fatal fall: The 29-year-old's death was described as a 'freak accident'

A
law enforcement official told the Journal that Ms Brigham was staying 
with a male roommate in an apartment in 191 Orchard Street, and she was 
found bleeding on the second floor landing of the building.

The
roommate told police that the last time he heard from Ms Brigham was 
shortly before her death, when she called him at work and 'sounded 
distraught'.

The Local East Village blog of The New York Times reports that an unnamed resident of the building found her and spoke to police extensively after they arrived on the scene.

'She did not look like she was homeless or a hooker,' the resident, who is also a medic, told The Local East Village reporter.

'She had too many accouterments of the average American young person in her 20s: An iPhone and wallet full of plastic.

'She had compound fractures in her arm and she was cut.'

Her death was confirmed by former Mayor Ed Koch, who worked with her father James Brigham Jr. from 1978 to 1981.

'They are wonderful people. She was absolutely extraordinarily beautiful. It just shook me as if I were kicked by a horse. It’s just awful,' Mr Koch said.

Ms Brigham worked as an exhibit installation specialist at the American Museum of Natural History from 2007 to April of this year, and graduated from University of Mary Washington.

Ms Brigham and Mr Champalimaud married in August 2011 in the chapel at St. George's School, an elite boarding high school in Newport, Rhode Island, from which the groom graduated in 1996.
