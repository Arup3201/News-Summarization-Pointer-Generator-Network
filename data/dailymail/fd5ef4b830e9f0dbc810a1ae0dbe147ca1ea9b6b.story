Quarterback Russell Wilson who starred in the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl win in February is divorcing his wife after just two years of marriage.

Wilson, 25, met Aston Meen in high school in Richmond, Virginia, and she twice transferred university to be with him during his college career.

Wilson made the announcement in a statement released by the Seahawks on Wednesday. ‘Clearly, decisions like these don’t come easy,’ he said. ‘Ashton and I respectfully ask for prayers, understanding and privacy during this difficult time.’

The young Super Bowl-winning quarterback also noted that he would not be commenting further on the situation.

The couple had been together since high school. Meem originally attended the University of Georgia, but then transferred to North Carolina State, where Wilson was playing at the time.

When Wilson transferred to the University of Wisconsin, Meem moved with him.

They married in April 2012 after he finished his college career and before he was drafted by the Seahawks. The couple had been visible at Seahawks events for his first two seasons in the league.

Wilson led Seattle to a dominating 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII and is now predicted to become a $100 million brand

Meem infamously got a brief taste of the national spotlight during the 2012 NFL draft when her enthusiastic reaction to the news that the Seahawks had drafted Wilson went viral.

In a November interview with King 5 in Seattle, she described what was going through her mind at that moment.

‘The thing of it was, we had a camera crew in [Wilson’s house] all day with us, and I guess I was a little bit newer to that style of filming,’ Meem said.

‘So I thought they were gonna be like, “okay, ready, and you’re on.” They just kept flashing back and forth to us, and I was like, I’m gonna just enjoy this and be myself. And then the moment came, and I guess that’s the reaction I had.’

Wilson has been much in demand since winning the Super Bowl, he appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers in late February and has endorsement deals including Nike, Alaska Airlines, EA Sports and Levi's

The 25-year-old star is expected to be offered a contract featuring a nine-figure sum over the next few years - with further money-making opportunities off the field. 

Despite only being third-round draft pick on his first contract, Wilson is already one of the NFL's most marketable players - with current endorsement deals including Nike, Alaska Airlines, EA Sports and Levi's.

Last year, his jersey was the league's second best seller - succeeded only by that of Peyton Manning, who makes more than $5million off the field each year.

However, Wilson will be forced to wait at least a year for his predicted wealth.

Wilson's Super Bowl performance catapulted him to national attention and the next day he was spotted enjoying a basketball game with Jay-Z and Beyonce

The star, who is represented by Mark 
Rodgers, of Frontline Athlete Management, is tied into his $662,434 
salary for this year under the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, 
which states that rookie contracts cannot be renegotiated until three 
seasons have passed.

On the other hand, Wilson completed 72 per cent of his throws for 206 yards and two touchdowns - with 26 yards rushes on three carries.

But despite his stunning performance, he failed to win the Super Bowl MVP award, which was handed to linebacker Malcom Smith.
