For many women, a wedding dress is one of the priciest and most treasured possessions in their wardrobe.

But for Maryborough local Kim Sheard, hers was a reminder of some memories she would rather keep firmly in the past.

In need of some cheering up, and with a pretty white gown she would never use again, 37-year-old Kim's creative friends came up with an idea - trash the dress, by dredging it through some of the harshest conditions imaginable.

Kim Sheard decided to thrash her wedding dress after her marriage failed

Armed with her photographer friend Rowena Walker and social media genius Tabitha Penman, Kim and her mates thought up some of the wackiest ways to make sure the dress would never be worn again.

Inspired by a man in America who had trashed his ex-wife's wedding dress, the trio set up the 'Trash -That - Wedding Dress' page on Facebook, accumulating over 600 followers all eager to see Kim's dress take a trashing.

Kim and her friends didn't go easy on the white gown, testing it's material to the maximum by trawling it through a round of zorbing, parasailing, dirt-biking and even dirt-tobogganing.

'My friend Kim had recently broken up with her husband and we were trying to cheer her up, so the idea was that we would see how many ways we could trash her wedding dress but with a twist,' Kim's friend Tabitha told Daily Mail Australia.

'Instead of it being a bitter thing about revenge or spite we would use it as a great and fun excuse for us mums to get together and have fun doing things we wouldn't normally do'

'We are all housewife’s and working mums so we get so little time to do anything that’s fun or for us so we decided to use it as an excuse' she said.

Tabitha said it was 'therapeutic' for Kim to trash her dress after the breakdown of her marriage, however it became more about a bonding session with her friends than a revenge plot against her ex-husband. 

'Obviously she was upset that her marriage had ended,' she said, 

'It became more about having fun with your girlfriends and the bond of friendship and good times that help you get over the hurt and move on.'

By the end of their trashing, the dress had completely split up the back and was unwearable.

The girls were forced to put an end to their trashing when the dress ripped and Kim entered into a new relationship. 

'Now I still moderate the page and find and encourage other brides and photographers to share any fun trashes they have had,' Tabitha said.

Tabitha admits that she has seen similar pages on Facebook urging women to trash their wedding dresses. 

However she believes their journey is unique as no other page documents the journey of one woman trashing her dress on numerous occasions.

Tabitha revealed that the Facebook page encourages women to have fun after the breakdown of their marriage. 

The fun stopped for the girls when Kim's wedding dress split down the back 

'If one chapter in your life closes then open another with friends, laugh at yourself and start afresh,' she said. 

Deliberately ruining a wedding dress soon after a couple's big day has also been marketed as a romantic ritual by U.S. photographers. 

For some, the trashing is an act of commitment, as the wedding dress can never be worn again.  

The idea originated in Vegas and was touted as a way to give brides the chance to reuse their dresses in a scruffy atmosphere, in a total contrast to how they wore the gown on their wedding day. 

Some women decided to be tame on their dress, posing in the sea or in a forest, wrecking the dress only slightly. 

The trash the dress concept has been gaining momentum around the world for a number of years and is quickly coming into its own in Australia

However there is evidence of women burning their dress, rolling through mud and scuba diving in their gowns.

The results have been known to resemble art and are akin to what would be seen in a high fashion magazine.
