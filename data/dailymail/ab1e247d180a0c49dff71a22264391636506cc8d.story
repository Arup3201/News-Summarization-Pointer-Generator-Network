Gwyneth talks to Michaela Boehm, who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra

She has shared everything from street food reviews to suggesting water has feelings on her notorious blog.

Now Gwyneth Paltrow is taking a leaf out of Sting's book by talking all things tantric sex.

The clean-cut actress, 42, chats with a sex counsellor about how to use the ancient Indian form of meditation to create 'wild passion and deep intimacy'. 

In her latest post on Goop, Gwyneth talks to Michaela Boehm, who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra, about how to re-establish sexual polarity, or sexual tension, in your relationship.

Michaela, a yogi and psychologist, tells the mother-of-two - who announced her 'conscious uncoupling' to Chris Martin earlier this year - to let go of tightness and strain in order to 'fall into each other through eye contact'.

She says that 'while our bodies are open and unguarded' maintaining eye contact with your other half can be 'delicious (and a bit scary!)'.

'Practice looking at each other, while staying relaxed, breathing and simply noticing when you have reached a threshold where it’s just a bit too intimate. 

'Hang out there for a bit and you will find that this can be as good as sex!' she says.

But in order to get to that stage, you first need to re-establish the purpose of your relationship and your sexual essence - whether masculine or feminine - so you can 'offer it as a gift'. 

She stresses that nowadays women are at work just like men, and this means they  spend their days 'in the masculine aspect, making decisions and directing others'. 

'In fact, the first thing many women may want to do after work is to get "full" again, to get back into their feminine aspect. They might want to do this by having a glass of wine, taking a bath, chatting with a friend, their mother, or their children, or downloading their husband on their day. 

'Meanwhile, their husband might want to either get into, or stay in, his masculine aspect - this means that he wants to get "empty" or be quiet.'

As you both crave something the other doesn't want, neither party ends up getting what they need. 

So Michaela advises playing up to primitive gender roles.

For example, in a heterosexual couple, the man can retreat to how he behaved at the start of a relationship by taking charge of planning dates.

While gender equality in relationships is 'a great thing, it's just all in the framing,' says Michaela.

'For many women, the idea of coming home from work and being greeted at the door by a smiling, apron-clad husband actually feels disconcerting - even though the idea of a husband who makes dinner is very appealing.

'What needs to happen to create ideal sexual tension... is for the husband to direct the wife when she steps through the door to have a glass of wine, or a bath, or to go relax and change,' Michaela advises.

'He is directing her to get full. 

'Women balk at this, but for sexual tension, it’s essential. There needs to be that separation - getting full and getting empty - before they can come together again fully charged.'

Michaela and Gwyneth are clearly onto a hot topic.

Almost 25 years after oversharing about his seven-hour long sex sessions with Trudie Styler, Sting's talking tantric sex again, on national TV.

The former Police frontman, 63, and his wife, 60, appeared on American chat show, Watch What Happens Live, yesterday, as Sting told host Andy Cohen that the pair still make love 'often', after decades of marriage.
