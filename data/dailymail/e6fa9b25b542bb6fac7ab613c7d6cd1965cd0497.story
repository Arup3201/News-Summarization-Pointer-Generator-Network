Yesterday, I washed down the turkey with a glass of donkey milk. After all, it’s a perfect festive drink — no Nativity scene is complete without a donkey looking over Jesus in his manger.

And the flavour was surprisingly pleasant, although I expected more of a kick. It was reassuringly odourless, and looked and tasted just like skimmed cow’s milk, although a tad sweeter.

But the real reason I downed the stuff is that, to some, it’s a veritable elixir.

Hailed by the ancients as a cure for a variety of ailments and an anti-ageing skin tonic, donkey milk is enjoying a revival. And its popularity is likely only to grow further after Pope Francis this month revealed he was fed it as a baby in Argentina to supplement his mother’s milk.

Pieris Georgiadis is already a convert to its benefits. As the owner of Cyprus’s biggest farm producing the milk, he drinks it daily in its fresh, unpasteurised form. At 54, he’s only a year younger than me, but looks stronger and more youthful.

‘Donkey’s milk is a serious product,’ he assures me. Certainly, scientists are becoming increasingly interested in it.

The milk’s medicinal virtues were first heralded by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, who recommended it to combat a host of bodily woes, including liver problems, fevers, infectious diseases, poisoning, joint pains and nose bleeds. The Romans later added constipation to that list.

The use of donkey milk as a moisturiser in cosmetics is even more fabled, thanks to Cleopatra. The Egyptian queen took a daily bath in it, with a steady stream of milk supplied by more than 700 lactating asses. The stuff ‘erases facial wrinkles, makes the skin more delicate and maintains the whiteness’, enthused Pliny the Elder, an ancient Roman know-it-all.

Of course, people have drunk it as part of their daily diet, too: fresh donkey milk was widely available in 19th-century London as an alternative to the highly adulterated cows’ milk sold by dairies.

Now, with more and more people looking to avoid cow’s milk products because of dairy allergies, interest in alternatives is growing. Could donkey milk repeat the success of goat and sheep milk and, more recently, camel milk?

As it’s rich in lactose — a type of sugar — and low in fat, donkey milk is the closest animal milk to the human variety. Its nutritional properties may make it more suitable for the ‘2 to 6 per cent of the population’ who are allergic to cow milk, according to a UN study.

D onkey milk is also vitamin-rich and contains anti-bacterial proteins and anti-allergens — substances that regulate the immune system, countering allergic reactions — reputed to alleviate skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, as well as asthma and bronchitis.

I first learned of the milk’s reputation last month when, amused to see bars of donkey milk soap, liqueur, chocolate and cosmetics in a Cypriot gift shop, I asked if they were meant as joke presents.

The assistant soon set me straight. I was particularly intrigued by her account of a Dutch customer who snapped up 15 bars of the soap, declaring they were the best relief for his psoriasis, an irritating skin condition.

Every few months for the past 15 years the skin under my beard and eyebrows has become red, itchy and flaky. I suspect it’s psoriasis but have never had it properly diagnosed — I usually manage to get rid of it in a few days with a cream applied topically.

This year, though, the itchiness has returned more aggressively. The shop assistant directed me to her supplier: Pieris at his Golden Donkeys Farm in the hilly village of Skarinou.

Home to 200 of the animals, the farm is proving a hit with both health-conscious holidaymakers and locals, many of whom remember their grandmother’s tales about the benefits of supping donkey milk.

I see two elderly but sprightly-looking nuns sporting sunglasses in the farm’s gift shop snapping up several bottles of fresh donkey milk (but, God bless them, no donkey milk liqueur).

They’re regulars, according to Pieris, getting the weekly supply for their community. ‘Drinking the milk is the best way to get the benefits of its antibiotic properties,’ he says.

And he’s not asking people to take him on faith. To get a scientific stamp of approval, he has called the Cyprus University of Technology in Limassol to oversee his work. Dr Photis Papademas, a lecturer in dairy science, has been interviewing people who’ve been drinking milk from the farm regularly over a period of two to three months.

‘From what they say, they’ve had some remarkable results, especially children with asthma or coughs and for some with eczema and psoriasis,’ says Dr Papademas.

‘Now we’ll try to get a clinical study going on the adults to see if this milk really is as promising as it looks. We know already that traditionally it was used by people just a few generations ago to treat whooping cough in young children.’

The science behind the milk’s therapeutic properties does seem intriguing.

Like humans, donkeys have a single stomach. Yet we mostly drink the milk of multi-stomached animals such as cows and goats, which use a lot of bacteria to digest their food through a complicated fermentation process.

Donkey milk is not only very close to human milk in composition but contains protective anti-bacterial agents — one of which ‘seems to be maybe 200 times more active than in cow’s milk’, says Dr Papademas. This might explain why donkey’s milk appears to be particularly free of germs.

‘As a scientist I’m always cautious, but this milk looks promising,’ he says. So, why aren’t we all drinking donkey milk already?

At €24 (£19) a litre in Cyprus it doesn’t come cheap, and the average price in other countries is twice that. In Europe, it’s produced in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Holland, Serbia and Bosnia; far more is produced in Latin American countries.

Two years ago, there were reports tennis ace Novak Djokovic had bought up his country’s entire supply of donkey milk for a chain of restaurants he’d opened in Serbia

The problem is a jenny — a female donkey — produces just a litre of milk a day for six to seven months a year, while a cow can deliver 30 times as much. Also, a donkey won’t produce milk unless it’s stimulated by the presence of its foal, and milking has to be done manually.

But only a little is needed to feel the benefits, according to Pieris, He recommends drinking just 60ml a day — ‘all you need to protect your body’. He also uses donkey milk to make an unusual liqueur, which looks and tastes like Baileys Irish Cream, but isn’t quite as creamy.

British aficionados can buy donkey milk and products such as soaps, moisturisers, creams, shower gels and body lotions online. Eurolactis, the company that recently gave the Pope a couple of donkeys, is one supplier (eurolactis.com).

And a Swiss chef is already testing recipes with donkey cheese. ‘When you add in sugar and chocolate, in particular, the taste is amazing,’ 

Jean-Michel Evequoz told Modern Farmer magazine. He’s working on an ‘emulsion of donkey’s milk and wild flowers to complement a poached lobster’.

Pieris has no intention of turning his precious milk to cheese, however. ‘Donkey milk has virtually no fat —just 0.5 per cent — so you’d need 100 kilos of it to make one kilo of cheese,’ he explains. ‘Imagine how much you’d have to sell it for. In Serbia it costs €1,000 (£800) a kilo.’

Indeed, the crumbly white cheese is a coveted Serbian delicacy, known as pule.

Two years ago, there were reports that tennis ace Novak Djokovic had bought up his country’s entire supply for a chain of restaurants he’d opened in his homeland. He denied the claims, but it’s nice to think donkey milk might be the secret of his sporting success. Andy Murray should give it a try.

Back in Skarinou, Pieris loads with me presents: a bottle of the donkey milk liqueur, a tin of his extra virgin olive oil, which contains aromatic basil grown on the farm, and some delicious chocolate containing pasteurised donkey milk that tastes like Bournville.

But I’m most chuffed by the two bars of donkey milk soap that he pops in my gift bag.

Back home I lather it on — the itchiness under my beard goes within an hour. Three weeks on there’s no recurrence. The milk’s benefits may not yet be clinically proven, but I’m a convert.

My brother, a fellow sceptic, is also braying with delight. The eczema on his hands has cleared up after a week.

‘This soap seems to be doing the trick,’ he says. ‘Is it coincidence? I’ll keep using it to see.’

I just hope those nuns don’t buy up the entire stock.
