Warning: Former foreign office minister Kim Howells said that the upcoming NATO summit in Britain could be targeted by IS terrorists

Home grown Islamic State terrorists could be plotting a 'spectacular' attack on the upcoming Nato summit in Britain, a former foreign office minister has said.

Kim Howells, who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, fears jihadists may be planning to attack  Barack Obama, David Cameron and other world leaders when they meet  in Wales on September 4 and 5.

Security barriers and fences to stop car bombs have been put up around the Celtic Manor resort where meetings will be held and also in the centre of Cardiff where leaders will spend an evening.

Dr Howells warned that there was 'no question' terrorist organisations would be planning an atrocity but admitted there was no 'general intelligence' an attack was imminent.

He said: 'It will be a target, there is no question about it, that is why the security measures taken are so intense.

'With a Nato summit there is going to be a raised expectation or raised awareness that there might be an attack - that is why all the special measures have been taken.

'They might try and coordinate something with the Nato summit targeting somewhere there are a lot of infidels, as they see them.

'Like their predecessors Al Qaeda they like mounting spectaculars so I would imagine the work of the security services is pretty intense now.' 

Dr Howells said an 'added element' of the security risk is that three Cardiff men have fled to Syria to fight with IS, also known as ISIS and ISIL, and are believed to have joined the terrorist organisation.

Terror suspects Nasser Muthana, Aseel Muthana and Reyaad Khan have detailed knowledge of the Welsh capital where the world leaders will be attending a lavish dinner.

Dr Howells claimed Islamic State could target the summit which is taking place in Newport and Cardiff at the start of September.

The former Labour MP for Pontypridd, South Wales, said terrorists may also be planning something similar to the 7/7 bombings in London.

Falklands hero Simon Weston, who lives in Cardiff, echoed the warnings.

He said: 'We've got these youngsters from Cardiff who have gone to join the Islamic movement.

'That means they would not have been acting on their own at this end. There are others who have similar points of view.

'We run a real risk of something happening.'

'Everyone knows how difficult it is to get to the people they want to affect.

'But we have got to be right 100 per cent of the time. They have only got to be right once.That's the big difficulty for us.'

Assistant Chief Constable Chris Armitt - the Merseyside police officer overseeing security at the gathering - warned Isis were a 'very real threat.'
