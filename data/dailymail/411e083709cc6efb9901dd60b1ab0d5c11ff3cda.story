A millionaire tech CEO accused of beating up a former reality star at the Sundance Film Festival was booked in Summit County Jail Tuesday.

Patrick Henry was charged with assault, damage of a communication device and criminal mischief after allegedly beating up reality-star Ariane Bellamar at the film festival in January.

If convicted, the CEO of San Diego-based Entropic Communications could end up behind bars for a year. Henry was released after being booked.

The trip to the festival was supposed to be a romantic getaway for Beverly Hills Nannies star Bellamar and Henry, but she claims he beat her up in a jealous, booze-fueled rage on their second-night in Park City, Utah.

Evidence: Bellamar took several pictures of her bruised and battered body after the alleged attack

'The charges relate to allegations that on January 23, Mr Henry assaulted Ariane Bellamar. It is further alleged that when Ms Bellamar attempted to call 911, Mr Henry took her cell phone and threw it on the ground, damaging the phone's screen,' a statement from the Summit County Sheriff's Office read.

She has also released pictures of bruises on her body she claims proves she was attacked.

However, his lawyers told RadarOnline that he is innocent and that Ms Bellamar was ‘intoxicated’ on the night of the alleged attack.

A spokesperson for Henry said: ‘The statements made by Ms Bellamar are not consistent with the facts. Mr Henry did not attack or assault her.

‘Ms Bellamar had been drinking heavily and was intoxicated before dinner; she continued to drink during and after dinner. We are confident that when the facts come out, they will validate that Mr. Henry neither attacked nor assaulted her.’

Bellamar says she met the 51-year-old online through dating website MillionaireMatch.com after officially separating from her real estate mogul husband Barry Pettitt in November. 

Though she never met Henry in person 
person before the trip, she agreed to go because 'he seemed normal' and 
friends vouched for him.

She
 seemed to be having a great time when she posted a picture of the view 
from Utah on January 22. 'Park City is amazing!' she wrote.

But things allegedly took a turn for the worse on their second night out.

'He started doing shots...and became 
very jealous of the attention his friends were paying me,' Bellamar told
 Radar. 'I told him I wanted to leave [but] he did not. I took a cab 
back to the cabin, inadvertently locked the door behind me and went to 
bed.'

Looking for love: Bellamar says she met Henry on dating site MillionaireMatch.com, and that the two had not met in person before she agreed to be his date to Sundance

Happy start: On January 22, Bellamar posted a picture from Park City on her Facebook page. She says she agreed to go to the film festival with Henry even though she never met him in person

The next thing she 
says she remembers is being woken up by Henry, dragging her by the hair 
into the garage. She claims he screamed at her and accused her of 
purposefully locking him out even though he had a key.

'He
 then proceeded to throw me multiple times into the concrete walls of 
the garage,' she said. 'I am bloodied and bruised all up and down my 
left side of my body and… right side. It was terrifying.'

Bellamar
 provided pictures of her injuries to Radar which show bruises covering 
her left arm, thigh and backside with scabs on her hands and broken 
nails.

Abused: After returning from Utah, Bellamar went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a 'stress reaction to a recent assault'

'After three tosses,
 I just laid freezing on the garage floor, begging him to allow me into 
the house ,' Bellamar said. 'I thought that I was going to freeze to 
death. I was still in my cocktail attire from the evening. He looked 
crazy.'

Rich man: Henry is the Millionaire CEO of San Diego-based Entropic Communications. He met Bellamar on MillionaireMatch.com

'As I was laying 
bloody on his garage floor, I thought “Oh my God, I’m going to die 
here.” This is what you see on TV. I am not that person,' she added to 
MailOnline.

Eventually Henry
 agreed to let her back in, and Bellamar says she then went to sit on 
the couch where she started crying, curled up in the fetal position.

Henry allegedly yelled at her to stop crying, picking her up and throwing her back into bed.

Bellamar continued to cry and shake 'uncontrollably', prompting Henry to rip off the covers and tell her to leave.

Bellamar says she was in so much pain and shock, she didn't even respond so Henry called the police saying she wouldn't leave, she claimed.

She said the experience has been 'traumatizing' and that she cannot understand the domestic abuse 'as a woman or as a mother'.  

Four days after posting the picture from Henry's Park City home, she wrote a somber status on Facebook.

'Brutality
 against women never goes unpunished - never. You can run and/or try to 
hide, but it will catch up with you - always ... xo Peace Over 
Violence.'

Took a turn: But just four days later she posted a more ominous message on her Facebook

Back in her home 
of Santa Barbara, Bellamar went to the hospital where discharge records 
show she was diagnosed with a 'stress reation to a recent assault' and 
that she suffered 'multiple strain, contusions and abrasions' including 
hand and shoulder sprains.

After receiving requests for comment from Radar, Henry sent Bellamar two text messages.

First
 he wrote: 'I got an email from RadarOnline about the incident at my 
home in Utah last week. I plan to ignore the inquiry. If you want to 
discuss, please let me know. As far as I'm concerned it is private. Let 
me know your thoughts. I can forward the email if you want.'

A
 few hours later, he sent yet another text: 'Keep in mind if you 
publicly disparage me, I will reveal the facts of the situation in 
defense of myself.'

MailOnline asked Henry's company for comment, but has not received a reply.

Following the alleged attack, Bellamar is having trouble sleeping at night and has started seeing a therapist.

She says her husband has been 'extraordinarily supportive' despite their separation.

Another challenge is explaining her injuries to her 5-year-old daughter.

'I
 tell her you’ve got to be careful about who you’re around and not to 
talk to strangers. At my age, I should have listened to my own advice,' 
she said.
