Nolberto Solano has claimed he has already been interviewed for the vacant post as manager of Motherwell.

Club directors are still to talk to a number of candidates next week, including frontrunner Terry Butcher, Kenny Shiels and caretaker boss Kenny Black who has now indicated he would like to be considered.

On Friday, a club source cast doubt on Solano's claims but, as Sportsmail first revealed, the former Peru international, 39, is the choice of an Argentina-based consortium to take the reins at Fir Park should they gain control.

The Well Society are the preferred saviours of former chairman John Boyle. Still short of the £800,000 they need to purchase the owner’s 70 per cent stake, however, Solano is waiting by his phone for further news after insisting he held talks last month.

And the Newcastle United legend, who quit his post as technical director of FC Toronto in August, says he is desperate for a crack at Scottish football under new South American owners.

Last night he told Sportsmail: ‘I went to see Motherwell play against Dundee United five weeks ago, had an interview after that and since then I haven’t heard anything else.

‘As people probably know, the new prospective owner has not been able to complete a deal yet.

‘For me at the minute there is lots of talking, but there are a lot of things to be done before they take over. They don’t have 100 per cent ownership of the club.

‘The people concerned are from Argentina. I don’t know them especially well and I can’t tell you their names, but I know them through some friends of mine.

‘There is no deadline and I don’t know when or if they will complete. Because they are not from here it obviously takes a little longer. 

Solano spent eight years with Newcastle over two spells and also played for Aston Villa, West Ham and Hull

‘But from what I know they want to move the club forward, to challenge and finish in the top four consistently.

‘To try to qualify for Europe and build up an academy with good young lads from all over the world, not just South America.

‘They want to be a club which provides a window for the world. Not just from South America – if there are good young Scottish lads with potential they will get a chance as well.’

Currently based in England, Solano previously coached at Hartlepool United and Universitario de Deportes in his native Peru before his brief spell in Canada.

A former team-mate of Diego Maradona at Boca Juniors, he joined Newcastle when Kenny Dalglish was manager and says he has no concerns about moving to Scotland. 

The former Peru international, in action against Argentina, left his post as technical director of FC Toronto 

‘I am told Motherwell are interviewing four or five other coaches for the job as well. I understand that.

‘But I have been following them closely in the last few games and will be watching them again against Celtic tomorrow on television.

‘It’s a job I am very interested in and I have to be fully prepared in case the call comes at any moment.

‘They are struggling to win games now, but there are two or three teams like Ross County in the same situation so I am confident that if I can get the job I can get some players who can make them a winning team.

‘The priority is to keep them in the Scottish Premiership and build up from there.’ 

Former Hibernian boss Terry Butcher could move back to Motherwell where he managed between 2002-06

Former Well manager Butcher is the latest frontrunner for the post, but caretaker Black has now thrown his hat into the ring, too, after appearing initially reluctant to do so following Stuart McCall’s resignation.

The club’s general manager Alan Burrows told the BBC: ‘We thought initially Kenny was not interested in the position but Kenny and I had a conversation on Thursday and he said that he was keen to be considered. So Kenny will be spoken to.’

Meanwhile, Black, who has won one and lost two of the games in which he has been in temporary charge, said he expected a clear-out if Solano comes in under a South American regime.

‘I think we all know that if it’s the foreign route then the minute that was confirmed you could be packing your bags,’ he said. ‘They bring their own people in.’

A former Hearts coach under Vladimir Romanov, Black is wary of the impact foreign owners have had on some Scottish clubs, adding: ‘We have seen it happen at Livingston, at Dundee, at Hearts. I certainly would not like to see it happen here.

‘We are a little bit unsure of what is going to happen, but what better chance tomorrow than a game against Celtic to get talking about football again?’
