Community spirit: Gordon and Betty Fowle will be able to move back into their Cornwall home after a good Samaritan gave them £24,000

A mystery good Samaritan has given an 88-year-old D-Day veteran and his wife £24,000 to rebuild a collapsed wall of their cottage after an insurance firm refused to pay up.

Former Royal Navy serviceman Gordon Fowle and his wife Betty, both 88, were left homeless after the cold and wet weather brought down a wall of their house in Polgooth, St Austell, last month.

The couple were forced to move out and stay with friends and didn't know if they could afford to get their Cornwall home fixed after insurance chiefs at Prudential refused to pay for repairs.

But a mystery donor from their village has given the couple £24,000 to get the wall fixed in an incredible act of generosity so they can return to their home of 40 years.

With work on the site due to begin today, the great-grandparents, who have lived at the cottage for 40 years, said they were 'absolutely delighted'.

Mr Fowle, who was only a teenager when he took part in the D-Day Landings of 1944, said: 'It's tremendous - it really is.

'This man's unbelievable generosity has taken a huge, huge weight off our minds and we can't thank him enough.'

Mrs Fowle said the couple couldn't thank the man enough.

She added: 'It's wonderful - really wonderful that somebody would do this for us.

'We are very, very grateful to him. It's quite overwhelming really. We'd like to say a big thank-you to him.'

The couple were forced to stay with friends in the village and faced an uncertain future after Prudential refused to pay for the damage at their home. 

Struggling: The couple couldn't afford to fix a collapsed wall at their home after insurance company Prudential refused to cover the cost

They had believed their £500-a-year home insurance policy would meet repairs, but the insurance giant said frost had caused the damage, which they were not covered for.

Mr Fowle had been standing near the wall on January 26 just moments before it crumbled, narrowly missing him.

Locksmith James Flynn, 43, who is married to the couple's grand-daughter, said the stranger's act of generosity was a sharp contrast to the actions of the insurance company.

He said: 'His incredible act has shamed the Prudential. He has stepped forward to help Gordon and Betty on pure humanitarian grounds, which is what the insurance company should have done.'

It was initially feared repairing the wall would cost up to £30,000, but Bodmin-based builder Mark Williams managed to bring the price down.

Mr Flynn said: 'It's really touched us how the local community have really pulled out all the stops for them - they're all absolutely brilliant.'

Prudential bosses insisted the damage happened over a long period of time and was down to water getting in to the wall and then expanding and contracting with the changes in temperature.

They maintained that home insurance policies do not generally provide cover for damage caused by property age or maintenance-related issues.
