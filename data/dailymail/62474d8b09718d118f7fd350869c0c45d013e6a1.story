Well-spoken: Ben Fogle turned down elocution classes to change his upper-class accent because he wanted to stay 'true to who I am'

His cut-glass vowels and prep-school image may have won him a legion of female admirers.

But according to Ben Fogle, being posh is more of a liability than a help if you want to succeed in television.

The 39-year-old has revealed he was told to change his accent when he started out as a presenter 12 years ago because he was too well-spoken for the small screen.

Mr Fogle said he even turned down elocution classes to change his upper-class accent because he wanted to stay ‘true to who I am’

He became host of BBC1’s Countryfile in 2001 after finding fame on reality show Castaway, in which he was marooned on the Scottish island of Taransay for a year.

However, the former magazine picture editor claims ‘the class thing’ threatened to derail his career almost as soon as it began.

He said: ‘The class thing is interesting. I’ve lived with it for 12 years.When I started in television I was told I wouldn’t get anywhere unless I changed my accent, because I was too posh.’

After more than a decade hosting BBC programmes including Animal Park, Wild in Africa and Crufts, the presenter will star in a new ITV series about fishing later this year.

He also plans to film a ‘desert-based challenge’ with former Olympic rower James Cracknell before attempting to swim the Atlantic next year.

He said: ‘I beavered on for 12 years. I’ve just started a new series for ITV which is a first for me.

‘I’m breaking away from the BBC and I’m hoping that I’ve proven that your accent doesn’t define you.

‘I’ve spoken to lots of people and they say how they talk affects what work they get. But I’m glad I didn’t do those elocution classes because I’ve remained true to who I am.’

The son of actress Julia Foster and TV 
vet Bruce Fogle, Mr Fogle was educated at Bryanston School in Dorset, 
one of the country’s most exclusive public schools.

A former picture editor at high-society magazine Tatler, he is friends with Prince William through his wife Marina Hunt, who briefly dated the royal at St Andrews University.

As well as skiing with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Klosters, the pair were guests at the royal wedding in 2011.

Mr Fogle has established a devoted female fan club through his TV work.

After his mobile phone number was accidentally published in a magazine photoshoot, he received more than 3,000 calls and texts from women.

In July, Mr Fogle revealed he was ‘heartbroken’ following the death of his pet dog Inca.

The labrador, who joined him on Castaway and was his constant companion, had to be put down after being diagnosed with epilepsy and arthritis.

At the time, Mr Fogle said: ‘I just lost my best friend, Inca. Heartbroken doesn’t even begin to describe it’.
