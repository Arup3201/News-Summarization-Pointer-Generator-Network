An 18-year-old has become a master in creating beautifully macabre make-up.

Stephanie Fernandez, from Shreveport, Louisiana, transforms herself into otherworldly forms by using expert techniques.

The self-taught, freelance make-up has been doing make-up for four years and her make-up art varies from special effects and fantasy to high fashion and beauty.

Stephanie painstakingly creates the elaborate looks, recording each stage as she goes

The talented film student uses complex techniques such as facial prosthesis, seen here to create the large protruding mouth, to create her looks

The incredible finished looks are the result of hours of effort and specialised make-up techniques, as well as props such as wigs and coloured contact lenses

One of her series Colors Of My Mind’ sees her using photography and make-up to explore the ways she feels about certain colours.

It features themes ranging from nature-inspired hues for green to a frightening realistic representation of a bullet wound to the chest for red.

Much of Stephanie's work has a distinctly macabre and otherworldly feel to it

In 'Colors of my Mind' Stephanie uses both photography and make-up to explore the ways she feels about certain colours

Stephanie created this look as part of her Colours of my Mind collection and says on her website it is meant to make the viewer feel calm, comfortable and clean

Speaking of her obvious talent Stephanie simply says that she was born with 'art in her heart'

Film student Stephanie explains: ‘My make-up has been getting more recognition than it ever has and that alone inspired and was the motivation for this visual art piece.’

Talking about her inspirations for her work, Stephanie says: ‘I am an artist and was born with art in my heart. Of all of these artistic variations, make-up is most prominent. I have been doing make-up artistry longer than any other art form.

Stephanie hopes that those who see her 'Yellow' portrait will feel simultaneously  happy uncomfortable and annoyed

Half beautiful, half terrifying, the film student uses her skills to create a vast range of mesmerizing looks

Stephanie cites music as a large influence in her creations, which she has been doing for four years now

‘I have always been a fan of character transformation and I was about 14 years old when I first decided to experiment with makeup. What started out as a bored day at home experimenting with make-up, has become my career aspiration, reputation and ultimately the love of my life.

‘Of all my inspirations, music is very influential to my work. I love to be able to create and see what I am hearing, if that makes sense.

'I hear it and I do my best to create a visual of what and how I feel because of it. I am obviously in love with dark art!’

The talented entrepreneur also dabbles in film, photography, and mask-making, selling her psychedelic masks online on Etsy.com.
