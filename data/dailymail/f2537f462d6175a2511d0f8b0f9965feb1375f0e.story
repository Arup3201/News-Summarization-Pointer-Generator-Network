Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for Sportsmail. The Barnet boss recalls watching Phil Parkinson play for Reading and praises the Bradford manager's achievements at the League One Club.

PARKY’S MOUTH GUARD

I used to love watching my hometown team Reading, stood on the South Bank at their old Elm Park ground led by the their captain, Phil Parkinson.

Parkinson, the northerner, was the first player I’d ever seen wear a mouth guard like a Rugby League player.

He was fit as a butcher’s dog, a fearless tough tackler, smashing anybody in his way.

Parkison led Bradford to fourth-round FA Cup success against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in January

Stood on the terraces, as a Reading supporter, he was my hero.

Now in the technical area, he is writing his name into the history books at Bradford City football club.

Parky has moved and changed with the times.

Introducing top technical players like Filipe Morais and Billy Knott, both former Chelsea players, to a team who have used their centre-forward big-boy James Hanson to feed off the second balls and knock-downs.

Players who have struggled in the lower divisions, now passing through midfield, they have high attacking full backs and with their team spirit, tenacity and desire, Chelsea could not cope in the FA Cup.

Parkinson is another example of the good English managers out there – just like Karl Robinson at MK Dons and Paul Cook at Chesterfield. It can only be a matter of time before their qualities are recognised and top clubs will be fishing.

Why oh why do club owners keep going abroad and forgetting the good English managers and coaches who are out there?

CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR

All those Newcastle United fans moaning about Alan Pardew, who weren’t keen on him, have now seen from afar four victories for Crystal Palace and just one win for their own team under John Carver.

As a manager, if you lose your best players, it isn’t rocket science to work out you lose games. That happened time and again for Pardew.

The season before last they lost Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain midway through the campaign, their best player by a mile, and their season was over. Then Loic Remy left that summer to Chelsea.

Alan Pardew has enjoyed a great start at Crystal Palace after quitting Newcastle in December

Countless times at Newcastle he was forced to part company with his top players and try to find new ones. But that didn’t stop the fans getting on his back.

Newcastle supporters might find they regret getting their wish of getting rid of Pardew.

It happens throughout the leagues.

I heard a couple of weeks ago that Steven Pressley, the manager at Coventry City, is getting moaned at and shouted at by the supporters because the team isn’t winning.

Newcastle picked up their first victory under John Carver on Saturday with a 3-0 win against Hull

He is a top-quality manager. He gets his team to get the ball down and play. On top of that he is a humble, down-to-earth man with his feet firmly on the ground.

Like Pardew, Pressley has had his best players sold on but still done a fantastic job.

Coventry supporters beware, you don’t know how lucky you are.

WE’LL KEEP DEFYING THE CRITICS

Here at Barnet we have decided not to strengthen in the January transfer window.

Instead, we chose to reinforce all the positive messages and values that we put in place during pre-season.

Reminders of respecting each of your team-mates, respecting the staff, respecting the referees and their decisions and an ongoing focus to improve technically, individually and tactically as a team.

Barnet manager Martin Allen has decided not to strengthen his squad in January

I only have one full-time member of staff at Barnet, our young physio Jade Cook (she’s also our kit woman) who stepped up from the youth team. She’s only 23.

Two senior players, Graham Stack and John Nurse, help me with the warm-ups and together with our minted part-time analyst-cum-scout Omar Yabroudi (he’s also our kit man) we have built up a very strong unit with just 18 players in our squad.

They are humble, focused and we have tried our best to do things the right way on and off the field.

With 14 games to go, it’s very exciting times and the predictions from all the experts that we would be challenging for only the play-offs at the time probably seemed about right. It’s been remarkable, and I still think there is so much more to come.

PLAYER I KEEP HEARING ABOUT... CALLUM WILSON 

Two seasons ago, I saw Coventry play and they had a fantastic centre forward called Callum Wilson.

I left Northampton’s Sixfields Stadium one Sunday afternoon with his name in my little book marked as one for the future.

He was quick, a good athlete and a constant threat to the opposition. He was dangerous.

Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson is on the verge of reaching the Premier League

He was only around 20 or 21 at the time but knocked in 22 goals playing in League One last season.

Wilson moved to Bournemouth last summer for £3million – money Coventry badly needed – and has not stopped scoring in the Championship. He is now on the verge of the Premier League with them.

ONE THING I'D CHANGE ABOUT... THE SUBSTITUTES RULE 

There are seven subs allowed in the dugout on the side of the pitch for each game and it’s about time more of them are allowed to enter the field of play.

If the players you have aren’t doing it on the pitch, we as managers should be able to change them. It could bring a whole new tactical element to the game with managers able to change more than half of their team at half-time.

Bring it on, let’s bring them on!

BIG ISSUE... CALMING DOWN DIEGO COSTA 

Diego Costa is the perfect fit playing in Jose Mourinho’s team. He likes one up front with three attacking midfield players behind, all technically excellent.

Costa is good in the air, mobile, brave and mentally fearless. He leads the line and leads the team.

However, I’m sure, on the quiet, despite backing his man vehemently in public, Mr Mourinho would be having a quiet chat, privately and discreetly, to try to tame his tiger.

Allen says Jose Mourinho will have had a quiet word with Diego Costa after he was banned for three games

Mr Mourinho will be very happy with his will to win and desire, even though he has clearly over-stepped the mark a few times. It’s a fine line but Mourinho is the master of man-management.

It’s why I think Costa was the best piece of business done last summer.
