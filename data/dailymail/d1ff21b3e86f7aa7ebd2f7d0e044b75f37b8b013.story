Los Angeles police are hunting a 21-year-old driver suspected of ploughing into a crowd of spectators during a planned street race on Wednesday night.

Henry Gevorgyan was allegedly driving a souped-up Mustang that went out of control and plowed into spectators during a Chatsworth race at about 2:15 am on Thursday. 

The driver fled after the accident.

A souped-up car that was illegally street racing lost control and careened onto a sidewalk, killing two spectators and critically injuring another before its driver ran away early Thursday, police said

A 26-year-old man and a 50-year-old man were killed. 

A third man is hospitalized in critical condition.

Meanwhile, City Councilman Mitch Englander tells the Los Angeles Daily News he'll introduce an ordinance allowing police to seize cars involved in street racing or reckless driving resulting in serious injury or death.

Capt John McMahon told the paper: 'We are pursuing murder charges against the driver of one of the vehicles and continue to investigate the role and responsibility of the other.'

LAPD Detective Bill Bustos appealed to Gevorgyan to come forward.

He told a news conference reported by the LA Times: 'Please turn yourself in, it's just a matter of time before we get you. The community knows who you are.'

All three victims were struck by a silver, late-model Mustang that hit a curb, bounced onto the sidewalk, spun around and crashed into a utility pole, Los Angeles police Detective Bill Bustos said
