He's the cool, calm and collected Frenchman who's dubbed 'The Professor' in football.

But yesterday Arsenal's long-serving manager Arsene Wenger was humiliated when he fell flat on his face.

After seeing his title-chasing side thrashed 5-1 by Liverpool, Wenger took an embarassing tumble on his way back from the city.

The French slipped while carrying suitcases on his way into Liverpool Lime Street Station after the loss.

The 64-year-old grimaced in pain and rubbed his behind as two British Transport Police officers helped him up.

A club spokesman said: 'He's fine.'

Predictably, the fall led to a flurry of activity on Twitter.

One user said: 'Wenger knows how to make an exit from Liverpool. When his team slips up so does he. Steady the ship man!'

It was just one of those days for Wenger, who saw his side go 4-0 down within 20 minutes at Anfield before conceding another before they pulled one back.

'What is important is that we respond to that result, especially respond with a different performance because our performance overall was poor,' Wenger said.

'On the concentration level, on pace, on defensive stability, it was very poor and we always looked vulnerable.

'If you concede two early goals from set-pieces then you are in a position where you always have to come out.

'I just think the whole team have failed to turn up with the right performance. We know that you need to be better focused at this kind of level.'

'Overall our performance was just not good enough and I include myself in that performance.

'For me it is maybe better I don't talk too much, go home and respond better on Wednesday night.

'Congratulations to Liverpool. They were the best team today and we were very poor - only our fans were good for 90 minutes.'

And it wasn't just the manager who slammed the hapless performance.

Per Mertesacker also apologised to the fans, who were in high spirits throughout the game despite the result.
