When Norman Rushworth first went to his local, a pint cost just 5p.

Every Friday and Saturday since 1933 at 5pm, he has ordered the same thing, a glass of Shropshire Gold.

So when he turned 100 years old, there was only one way Britain’s 'oldest pub regular' was going to celebrate – a pint down the Golden Cross.

For Queen and country: Norman Rushworth has been drinking at the Golden Cross, Shrewsbury, for the past 80 years. He celebrated his 100th birthday with a pint of his favourite ale - Shropshire Gold

Veteran: Norman Rushworth was in the RAF during the Second World War

But the twice widowed great-grandfather, who has sunk around 10,000 in his 80 years of drinking, shows no sign of slowing down.

Mr Rushworth, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said: ‘My secret to a long life is a pint of beer of course.

'I also like dancing and women. What else is there?’

Other regulars make sure his favourite spot by the bar is clear at the 600-year-old pub in the town centre.

The RAF veteran drove an ambulance converted into a dental surgery for the troops in Europe after D-Day.

After leaving the air force, he became a dental technician in Shrewsbury – a stone’s throw away from his favourite watering hole.

He said: ‘My friends and I used to come in at lunchtimes and at weekends.

‘But we couldn't afford to come in every day.

'Four of us would come in, we used to sing songs and play games.’

Cheers: Mr Rushworth has sunk nearly 10,000 pints in his local pub, The Golden Cross, since he was 20 years old

Local: Norman even has his own spot at the bar

Landlord Gareth Reece, 49, said Mr Rushworth had become a part of the pub's heritage.

‘He comes for a coffee on Friday and on Saturday he has a beer or two,’ he said.

‘It is his secret to a long life - good beer, dancing and women.

‘Not many pubs have got customers who have been regulars since before the war.

‘Norman is part of the make-up of the place.

'He is such a regular, he sits there and his little crew of mates come and see him.

‘All his old apprentices at the dental practice come and see him.

'He is always cheerful and he is remarkable really.

‘He makes his own way here every week on his own.

'A pint of Shropshire Gold is his favourite tipple.’

Mr Rushworth has spent his whole life in Shrewsbury and married his first wife Elsie after leaving the RAF.

The couple had one son, John, who now lives in France, before Elsie died in 1974 aged 47.

Norman married his second wife Dorothy when he turned 80 in 1993 but she died shortly afterwards.

He is a talented tenor singer and dancer and still makes frequent trips to Blackpool.
