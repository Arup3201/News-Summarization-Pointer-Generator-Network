Fraud: Stacey Bann, 23, plundered more than £35,000 from her dementia-suffering grandmother's account

A young woman has been jailed for stealing her dementia-suffering grandmother's £35,000 life savings to spend the money on designer clothes and drugs.

Stacey Bann, 23, threatened her parents with a knife when she was confronted over the missing money, the court was told.

She obtained bank account details for 89-year-old Noreen Cunnington while visiting her home then set up a bogus account in her name at Halifax.

Bann then transferred money from her grandmother's account to the new one on 23 separate occasions. She later took the money for her own use.

Louise Gallagher, prosecuting, told Sheffield Crown Court that Mrs Cunnington was in the early stages of dementia after having a fall and is wheelchair-bound.

Within a period of five months last year nearly all of the pensioner's £38,714 life savings were stolen.

'Everything had been withdrawn by the defendant,' she said.

Bann started wearing expensive clothes and shrugged off questions by saying she could afford it out of her apprentice plasterer's wages.

When her father noticed £9,000 had disappeared from Mrs Cunnington's accounts Bann just said her grandmother had given it to her as a gift.

By August Bann had quit her job but she was still 'flush with money' and her father alerted his ex-wife, the victim's daughter, who found the money had been stolen.

'Both her parents expressed shock that she did this to her own grandmother, she would have given her anything she needed,' said Miss Gallagher.

The victim told police she was 'upset and annoyed' at what had happened. She now lives in a care home.

Bann, from Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, was in tears in the dock as she admitted fraud.

None of the money she has stolen has been repaid, and it is believed to have been spent.

Judith Seaborne, defending, said Bann, who lives with her cousin, was a qualified plumber and plasterer but was now living on benefits.

She felt frustrated at not being able to drive to look for a job and had been unable to work because of an old hand injury.

Her seven-year relationship also ended in March last year and she became increasingly depressed.

'She's quite simply disgusted with herself and wants to repay the money,' said Mrs Seaborne.

'There's no reason or excuse she can offer for her offending.'

She had been unable to see her grandmother to apologise and had difficult relations with all of her family.

Judge Julian Goose jailed Bann for 12 months and told her she will serve half before she is released on licence.

He told her: 'Over a period of five months you obtained £35,340 from your vulnerable and elderly grandmother. She was 89 and extremely vulnerable.'

He went on: 'It was a determined and committed attempt to take money from your grandmother without her knowledge.

'It was aggravated by the fact that you knew your grandma would not check what was going on and she was suffering from the early stages of dementia.'
