Running through the arid desert in the searing heat armed with AK-47s, these pictures show the gruelling work out undertaken by Pakistan's female volunteers. 

They have been put through their paces in an intense commando training to help combat the Taliban.

After the training - which took place in the Hakimabad district of Nowshera in northern Pakistan - the policewomen will take charge in police raids within anti-terror operations. 

More women are being recruited to fight the Taliban as NATO forces withdraw from neighbouring Afghanistan this month. 

They also have the advantage of being able to perform jobs that men cannot - in the segregated and strictly religious world of Pakistan - women can only be searched by women.

Their training also comes in the wake of signs of greater co-operation between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US in the last week. 

For years the Pakistani military has been accused by the Afghans, the Americans and NATO of helping the NATO-US coalition in Afghanistan on the one hand, but at the same time allowing al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban to seek refuge and gather support in Pakistan.

Moreover, many leaders of the Afghan Taliban have lived in Pakistan since 2001. 

The training comes in the wake of stronger relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US

Their training comes at a time when relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan are improving 

But this week, for the first time in nearly 10 years, the Pakistan army killed a high-level leader of al-Qaeda, Adnan el Shukrijuma, who had planned several failed attacks in the US and Britain. 

He was killed during a raid by Pakistani forces close to the Afghan border in the South Waziristan tribal agency.

The next day it was reported a US drone had killed nine suspected Pakistani Taliban including a senior commander Umer Farooq.  

In a sign of improving relations, the US has also started to appease Pakistan. 

A former top Pakistani Taliban commander, arrested by US forces in Afghanistan last year, was repatriated to Pakistan. 

It has since handed over a further three Pakistani Taliban, including former second-in-command, Latif Mehsud.

Elsewhere, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have long had a rocky relationship, have enjoyed stronger relations.  

The Afghans say a new era began when Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was inaugurated in September.

And last week, Ghani and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had a warm meeting at a conference in London.
