Fashion models are not, as a rule, known for their particularly sweet teeth.

But just because they're not allowed to eat cream cakes, lollipops, iced buns and macaroons, doesn't mean they're not allowed to wear them...

A number of Japan's high-end pastry chefs have taken their tasty wares out of the kitchen and into the studio, designing edible clothes as part of the annual Tokyo Sweets Collection catwalk show.

The country's top p√¢tissiers, including Koichi Izumi, Toshihiko Yoroizuka, Toshi Yoroizuka and Hironobu Tsujiguch, designed hats, bags, shoes and dresses that were, quite literally, good enough to eat.

Strawberries, moulded gels and spun sugar sat atop the heads of models while whipped cream belts held up their delicious dresses.

Yoroizuka admitted to ITN's Jeremy Barnes that
while the prime concern for his sweets was usually to taste good, the 
clothes and accessories he baked specifically to be worn in the Tokyo Sweets 
Collection primarily needed to look the part.

He
said: 'For the fashion show it's not about cooking the macaroon for the 
best flavour, but about it looking beautiful. Even perhaps cooking it to
be a bit harder than usual. The intent is to create something that will
inspire and look beautiful.'

Fellow chef Izumi said he definitely sees edible outfits in the future of fashion.
