Arsene Wenger could reignite interest in Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas in January, according to reports on the continent.

Current Gunners No 1 Wojciech Szczesny looked unimpressive as he shipped two goals in the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night and is not currently being pushed for his place in the starting line-up.

Arsenal explored a move for Casillas in the summer but decided against bringing the veteran to north London.

Iker Casillas is attracting renewed interest from Arsenal ahead of the January window, according to reports

However, French paper Le10sport claim Wenger could be tempted to go back in for the Spain legend in the January transfer window to provide Szczesny with competition.

Monaco are also keeping tabs on the situation and have the capacity to make a big money offer for Casillas, who has recently won his place back in Carlo Ancelotti's side.

The Bernabeu icon was subjected to derisory whistles and boos from fans in Real's last home league match, a 2-1 defeat against city rivals Atletico Madrid. 

But Real supporters didn't hesitate in commending his work on Tuesday night when he was called into action against Basle and made an excellent reflex save.

With rumours of Casillas's desired departure gathering speed, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez curiously chose this week to present the keeper with a memento for his 15 years service with the club. 

Perez presented Casillas with a replica model of famous Madrid landmark La Cibeles, a statue featuring Phrygian goddess Cybele on a chariot pulled by two lions that has stood since the 1700s.

Casillas was second-string to Diego Lopez under Ancelotti and used mostly in European matches but since Lopez's move to AC Milan in the summer, he's been in competition for the No 1 shirt with Costa Rica's Keylor Navas.

Ancelotti has put his faith in Casillas for the time being.

'He (Casillas) has never lost our confidence,' Ancelotti said. 'We congratulated him ... for his anniversary with Real Madrid and we wish him the best for the future. We have the same confidence in him as always.'

Wenger signed Colombian David Ospina from Nice for £3.2million in the summer, but that move is considered more as back-up for Szczesny than any sort of challenge. 

Although yet to appear for the Gunners, Ospina's arrival fills a void left by Lukasz Fabianski, who moved to Swansea having become fed up with being the understudy to Poland's Szczesny.
