Even thousands of miles away from Washington on the sandy beaches of Hawaii, President Obama can't escape from protesters.

On the first full day of  vacation, Obama and his family had a quiet morning in their vacation home in Kailua, a seaside town on the island of O'ahu, that was interrupted by a small demonstration.

The contingent of protesters gathered outside Saturday morning, with signs reading 'Stop the Killer Drones!' and 'More Immigration Reform ... and Thanks.'

The protests were not out of the ordinary, as Reuters reports that demonstrations took place for several days during the president's vacation in 2013.

A stream of cyclists and joggers passed, undeterred by either the demonstrations or the Obamas' security detail. 

Back on the East Coast, a gunman opened fire into a police cruiser parked on a Brooklyn street, fatally shooting two NYPD officers, before turning the gun on himself, Yahoo! News reported.

The killer, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, had shot and seriously wounded his ex-girlfriend in her Baltimore-area home earlier that morning before traveling to Brooklyn while hinting of his plans to kill police in posts on Instagram.

The president left his house before noon for Marine Corps Base Hawaii, which overlooks the crystal waters and lush mountains by Kaneohe Bay.

On the base, Obama played golf with friends Mike Brush, Joe Paulsen and Bobby Titcomb, according to the White House Press Office.

Briefing: The White House press pool reported the president was briefed on the shooting in Brooklyn, but the pool was 'holding while POTUS golfs'

Arrival: The Obamas arrived in Hawaii late Friday in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for their family vacation, which was disrupted Saturday by a small gathering of protesters at the home

The White House press pool reported that Obama was briefed on the shooting and that White House officials were monitoring the situation.

According to reports, the pool waited while the president finished golfing.

President Obama returned to Kailua in the late afternoon, though the protesters had already gone home, taking their signs with them.
