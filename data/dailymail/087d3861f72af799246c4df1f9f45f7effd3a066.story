He has made no secret of his love of hunting.

Away from the politics Republican presidential pick Paul Ryan likes nothing better than to go deer or turkey shooting with a bow.

That affection for outdoor pursuits has led to the Secret Service codename of 'Bowhunter' in tribute to his skills as an archer.

Born to be wild: Paul Ryan's Secret Service code name is 'Bowhunter,' no doubt because of his deep love for hunting

Stumping: Republican vice presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan speaks to supporters at Westlake Recreation Center today in Westlake, Ohio

Ryan chose the name himself after being elevated from a Senator to a heartbeat away from being the US President if Mitt Romney wins the election.

Secret Service agents will use the code name 'Bowhunter' when talking about the VP candidate in radio transmissions, GQ exclusively reported.

His wife Jana came up with the more feminine name of 'Buttercup'

Mitt Romney chose the name of 'Javelin' as his Secret Service code name with speculation that he chose the moniker in tribute to a car his father's company once manufactured.

Code names: Paul Ryan, and wife Janna appear on stage at the Wisconsin delegation's Beers and Brats event last week; Janna picked the codename 'Buttercup'

Opposition: President Obama's code name is 'Renegade,' while Mitt Romney, right, chose 'Javelin'

While his wife Ann has her own Secret Service detail, her code name has yet to be revealed.

A Secret Service spokesman declined to comment, although the Service has said in the past that the publication of code names does not risk the security of its protectees because all radio communication is now encrypted.

President Obama's code name is ‘Renegade’ and former President George W. Bush is ‘Trailblazer.' 

Jay McAninch, president of the Archery Trade Association, said Ryan is a skilled shot with a hunting bow.

Deer hunting, with a bow or rifle, is one of Ryan's hobbies, and he has been photographed in his Capitol Hill office drawing a bow. 

He also appears on the cover for the October issue of Deer and Deer Hunting Magazine. 

He told the magazine he killed his first deer at 16, and said his own kids now enjoy going hunting with him.
