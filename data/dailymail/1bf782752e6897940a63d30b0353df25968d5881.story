Electrician Brad Coyne was called to the home of Marcus Volke and Mayang Prasetyo on Saturday night

The electrician told Ten Eyewitness News that he caught a whiff of a strong smell as soon as he walked into the couple's apartment, which they had only moved into just weeks before the tragic murder-suicide.

As soon as I walked he said "You have to mind the smell". Obviously the smell is quite strong,' Mr Coyne said.

'He said I’m cooking pig's broth at the moment.'

Channel Ten obtained a recording of the conversation Mr Coyne had with Ms Prasetyo's husband on the night her body was found by police in the Commercial Road apartment.

Volke is heard saying: 'G'day is this a 24-hour electrician?'

Mr Coyne replies: 'It is.'

The 28-year-old goes on to say: 'Yeah I have a bit of a problem. Um, I was cooking on my stove.'

The electrician said when he arrived he felt the carpet squelching as he walked across the apartment

Police arrived at the couple's home on Saturday night after reports from neighbours about a bad smell coming from the apartment.

When officers arrived Volke fled from the scene and was later found with his throat cut in an industrial bin on nearby Dath Street.

It has been revealed Ms Prasetyo, 27, was a high-class prostitute from Indonesia and her husband was also a sex worker who went under the pseudonym, Heath XL.

Previously, it was reported when Volke texted the electrician and said he could not take a picture of the stove because he had 'no lights'.

When Mr Coyne arrived, he said the carpet squelched under foot,Ten Eyewitness News reported on Monday.
