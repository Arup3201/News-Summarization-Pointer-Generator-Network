Nicole Miller from Wallsend, North Tyneside lost 18 stone in 15 months

A mother-of-three who lost a staggering 18 stone in 15 months is celebrating her weight loss with her new toyboy.

Nicole Miller, 36, went from 27 stone to nine stone in just over a year, determined to turn her life around after ending an abusive relationship.

And now the ex-chip shop owner from Wallsend, North Tyneside, has found love, with Lee Richardson, 27, with whom she plans to set up a weight loss business.

Glamorous Nicole is now a svelte size 8 and even shares clothes with her 11-year-old  daughter.

She has her sights set on becoming a bodybuilder after a tummy tuck operation to remove excess skin in the summer.

Nicole, who suffered from depression, weighed 27 stone size for 11 years due to her constant comfort eating.

On an average day, Nicole would consume in excess of 5,000 calories binging on junk food and waking in the night with food cravings

Nicole's diet consisted of takeaways, multiple packets of crisps, biscuits, stacks of bacon sandwiches and microwave curries.

'I wouldn't really have breakfast,' said Nicole.

'I would start eating at about 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

'I would have four bacon sandwiches and then just eat continuously as the day went on.

'I would eat anything and everything.

'I would even get up in the night at two or three in the morning and eat.

'I would make sandwiches, microwave curries - anything - and I must have eaten half of the profits out of my chip-shop.

'Then when I was full I would go back to bed. It was out of depression. I wasn't being greedy - I was comforting myself.'

It was a trip to her GP 15 months ago that set Nicole into action, when the doctor told her that her weight was slowly killing her.

But despite being offered gastric band surgery, Nicole wanted to lose the  weight herself, and embarked on a strict regime of exercise and healthy eating. The next day, Nicole started at the gym.

'It took me 20 minutes to walk in,' she said.

'I was so embarrassed. I thought everyone would be looking at me and laughing but it wasn't like that at all. At first I could barely walk on the treadmill for two minutes but now I can run for an hour solid.'

It wasn't an easy journey for Nicole, who still exercises four times a week, but every day without fail she would turn up at the gym for another gruelling session.

The hard work soon started to pay off, and in the first week Nicole lost 11lb, and has carried on shrinking ever since.

Nicole met her new boyfriend Lee a year ago, after the pair started talking about their bull mastif dogs outside of Nicole's chip shop in Whitley bay, North Tyneside.

'I didn't want a relationship when I was big because I didn't like myself,' said Nicole.

'I wasn't looking for a relationship when I met Lee but we just clicked.'

Lee, a website designer, said: 'She didn't want me, she just wanted the dog.

'When I see pictures of her at her 
biggest I can't believe she's the same person as she'd already started 
to lose weight when I met her.'

Nicole now wants to use her experiences to help other women who are struggling with their weight, and with the support of Lee, is starting up a weight loss and fitness business called Butterfly Diet.

'I've called it the Butterfly Diet because at 36 I have eventually become the butterfly I always wanted to be.

'During my marriage I was very unhappy.

'I was always made to feel like I wasn't important.

'I wasn't doing normal woman stuff like doing my hair and make-up because I wasn't allowed to do that.

'But now I've come out of my cocoon so to speak.

'I want to use my experiences to help other women.'

Nicole plans to show off all of her hard work by taking to the stage as a bodybuilder.

With competitions set firmly in her sights, Nicole intends to work on her muscle definition and compete as early as next year.

And Nicole's children, Harrison, 18, Abriz, 11 and Amir 8, couldn't be prouder of their mum - although the weight loss has led to a spate of wardrobe-raiding between mother and daughter.

'My 11-year old daughter has taken to stealing my clothes,' said Nicole. 

'I even caught her wearing my bra the other day. But I must admit, I did have her trousers on yesterday.

'At least I can chase them around the house now if they're naughty - they used to be able to get away!'
