Poland wants to lure 2,300 of its doctors to leave the NHS and return home.

Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return, declaring: ‘We want them back.’

He also cast doubt on proposals by Britain to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, insisting it will make little difference to the numbers of people who move to the UK in search of work and a better life.

Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said his country wants to attract more Polish doctors back home and dismissed the idea that benefit curbs would reduce the number of EU migrants to Britain

Around a third of the 133,000 doctors in the NHS in England Wales were trained outside the UK.

Mr Sobków suggested hundreds were from Poland, and he wanted them to leave the UK and return home.

‘Of course we want them back, of course,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘We have lost - from what I know - 2,300 doctors in Britain. Of course they were educated in Poland for free so we want them, it is obvious.

‘We are doing our best to create conditions so that they could come back and work in Poland.’

Many in the health service argue it could not cope without the influx of qualified professionals from overseas.

Almost a third of doctors working in the NHS were trained outside the UK, according to latest figures

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced dozens of extra foreign doctors had been drafted to bolster hospitals facing a winter crisis.

However, Tory MP Bernard Jenkin suggested Britain did not need as many foreign workers and curbs should be introduced.

‘Germany has a very low birth rate, they need foreign workers. We don’t.

‘It has been causing real problems in hospitals, schools, has contributed to shortage of housing, we need to be able to address this in our national interest – we respect theirs, they should respect ours.’

Labour last week announced it would ban migrants from claiming out of work benefits for two years and look to curb access to in-work benefits, like tax credits.

David Cameron is expected to make a speech on immigration within days in which he will also pledge to impose limits on migrants’ access to the welfare state.

David Cameron is expected to announce a major crackdown on benefits for migrants within days, after Labour's Rachel Reeves announced plans to ban claims for jobseekers allowance for two years and curb access to tax credits for those in work

Latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the EU were claiming jobseekers allowance in February this year

Latest figures show there are 64,830 EU migrants claiming jobseekers allowance in the UK, while are 252,000 working households from the EU receive tax credits.

Mr Sobków insisted that attempts to limit access to these benefits would not stop Poles moving to Britain.

‘I wouldn’t say it would have an enormous effect… benefit tourism is only a small fraction of abuse of the system.

‘People don’t come here for benefits they come here for work.’

He said that there are a lot of ‘wrong assumptions’ about the motivations people have for moving to the UK

‘One is people sit at home in Poland and start calculating how much they can lose and gain.’

‘We have several important reasons if we decide to emigrate to other countries to work.

‘I know very wealthy people who moved to Sweden and other countries for better research laboratories.

‘The wrong assumption is the same as it was 20 years ago that we have low skilled labour, a lot of them are low skilled but a lot of them are not.

‘They are attracted because the wages are higher, not the benefits.’
