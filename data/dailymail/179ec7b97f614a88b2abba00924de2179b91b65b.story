An Arizona man accused of kidnapping and killing his friend's 8-year-old daughter had been smoking methamphetamine all day before the child was reported missing, according to police.

A probable cause affidavit released Tuesday stated that Justin Rector, 26, of Bullhead City, told police that he had been getting high in an upstairs bedroom of his mother's home where Isabella 'Bella' Grogan-Cannella lived with her family.

The 8-year-old girl went missing while playing hide-go-seek with Rector September 1.

Revelation: Justin James Rector, 26 (left), told police he had been smoking meth in the hours before Bella Grogan-Cannella, right, was reported missing September 1 

Bella's body was discovered buried a shallow grave two days later a half mile from her Bullhead City home.

An autopsy determined that the little girl died of asphyxiation by strangulation. Grogan-Cannella was found naked from the waist own, raising suspicions that she may have been sexually assaulted.

Recort was indicted last Thursday on first-degree murder, felony counts of child abuse, abandonment of a dead body and kidnapping a minor under the age of 15. 

He is being held in jail without bond pending his arraignment Friday, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. 

Justin Rector had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of September 1, Police Chief Brian Williamson said at a after the suspect's arrest. 

Bella's 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw the girl with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am.

Later that morning, Rector allegedly stoles clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said.

Police arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance.

When her body was found on September 3, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said.

The 26-year-old family friend has been charged with kidnapping and murdering Bella, and police have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges. 

Rector has a long criminal history, including more than a dozen arrests in the past 10 years.

Just hours after Bella was reported missing, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect.

'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote.

'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' 

Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives.

Two weeks ago, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up.

Bella lived at the Bullhead City residence with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area.

Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs.    

Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was ultimately found as relatives held each other and wiped away tears. 

The girl was discovered wearing the same green, ruffled, sparkly tank top she had on when she was last seen, police said. However, authorities said she didn't have any clothing on her lower half, and they still are looking into whether she was the victim of sexual assault.
