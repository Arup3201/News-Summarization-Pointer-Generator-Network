Arrested: Anthony Reddick

The bodies of 13 pit bulls were found in the burnt-out remains of a house garage in Nassau County, with police arresting a man they believe was training them to fight.

Three pit bulls survived the fire and authorities said that one, called KK, had facial scarring that suggested it had fought regularly with other dogs.

Training paraphernalia was also found at the property, police said, which included a treadmill with dog tethers, animal vitamin supplements and documents about dogfighting.

Anthony Reddick, 53, from Freeport, who already has two convictions for dogfighting, was charged with breeding and training dogs for fighting.

The fire, which occurred on Friday, is not thought to have been started deliberately and Reddick claims that he burnt his hands trying to put it out, according to Newsday.com.

Police said that he fled the scene when they arrived, but was caught shortly afterwards in Hempstead.

Reddickâ€™s previous dogfighting convictions date back to 1998 and 2001 when he was charged with misdemeanour dogfighting and felony dogfighting respectively.

Judge Tricia Ferrell in Nassau County First District Court in Hempstead set bail at $20,000.

Friend Tony Johnson, who was at the hearing, said that he didnâ€™t think the dogs had anything to do with Reddick.

Reddick will appear at Nassau District Court in Mineola on Wednesday and faces up to four years in jail if convicted.

The dogs that survived the fire are being cared for in a local shelter.
