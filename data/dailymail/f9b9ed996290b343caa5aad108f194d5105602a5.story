These adorable baby red pandas almost jumped out of their fur when a zoo keeper crept up to surprise them. 

This hilarious video shows them contently eating a meal until someone gives them quite a fright, causing one of the babies to jump and fall before scurrying off.

And like a video of a panda sneezing in its enclosure, which has generated more than 40million online views, these pandas in Maruyama Zoo in Hokkaido, Japan, are proving popular with more than 460,000 views in just five days.

Caught unawares: One of the three-month-old babies almost jumped out of her fur as a zoo keeper creeps up infront of them suddenly in this hilarious video

The cute creatures caused the hilarious scene for onlookers earlier this month at the zoo.

Usually secretive and shy by nature, the babies – who are called Kin and Gin according to the YouTube description – caused quite a stir at meal time when they were crept up on.

Born three months ago at the zoo, the two females have joined some 1,000 animals living at the zoo in Japan.

Red pandas are regarded as 
'vulnerable' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, 
which means the species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

Due
to a combination of habitat loss and hunting, it is thought there are 
less than 2,500 of the gentle species left in the wild.

The
sneezing baby panda video became an internet sensation after the 
hilarious clip of a mother panda appears startled when her baby emits an almighty sneeze. 

The clip spawned numerous spoofs including one on the American cartoon show South Park.

Where did you come from? Wide-eyed and open mouthed, the baby was not expecting her meal to be interrupted by someone jumping out in front of her
