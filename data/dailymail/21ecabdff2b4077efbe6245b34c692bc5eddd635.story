Firefighters plucked a naked woman out of a chimney after she got stuck trying to sneak into her estranged ex-boyfriend's home at 5am.

The unnamed woman had to be busted out of the property in Woodcrest, California, early Saturday morning after she tried to get into the home of former boyfriend Tony Hernandez.

The 35-year-old is the mother of Hernandez's three children, who live at the house away from their mother. They were not in at the time.

She had knocked on the door and rung the bell during the night, but failed to wake Hernandez, according to ABC7 News.

She had reportedly taken her clothes off so she could fit more easily down the 12inch by 12inch opening. Images from the scene showed her bare legs dangling through a gap in the wall.

Hernandez said he only became aware of the woman around 4.30am when she called out to him after he woke up for work.

He told CBS Los Angeles that he didn't want her at the house, and that she isn't allowed to be around their children.

He said: 'I don’t like the way she’s acting or what she’s doing. That’s not good for my kids.'

Two dozen officers rushed to the property, and took two hours to let her out, according to KNBC-TV.

Officials say the rescue process took two hours. 

Once freed, she was taken to a hospital with moderate injuries.
