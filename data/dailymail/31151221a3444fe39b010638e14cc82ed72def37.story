A good samaritan died in a motorway horror yesterday after running into the road to help a man who had jumped from a bridge.

The motorist got out of his car after he saw the man leap on to the M1, but was hit by another vehicle. In a double tragedy, both men were declared dead at the scene by paramedics.

Last night, witnesses hailed the good samaritan as a hero.

Scene of the tragedy: Police examine the stretch of road where the two men died

Road closed: Hertfordshire Police and the East of England Ambulance Service were called to the incident on the northbound carriageway near Junction 5, close to the village of Bricket Wood, at about 10.45am

Coach passenger Rebecca Martin, a 
theatre manager from Manchester, said: ‘We came to a screeching halt and
 found out a man  had jumped from the bridge in  front of us. 

‘I
 thought it was a car crash at first, but there was no bang. I knew 
something was very wrong straight away. We were just three or four cars 
behind it. A car stopped and a man got out to help and was hit by 
another car.’

‘It’s awful. 
It was bad enough that one person fell off the bridge, but then to find 
out that a guy who stopped to help was killed is just so sad.

'He
 was obviously a very courageous guy – a real hero.’ The 32-year-old 
added: ‘I don’t know what I would have done in that situation.

‘It’s nice to know there are lovely people out there who would do something like that.’

Paramedics
 and an air ambulance were called to the scene, on the motorway’s 
northbound carriageway near Watford in Hertfordshire, at around 10.45am.

However, neither of the 
men could be saved. The road was closed for several hours in both 
directions   while police investigations were  carried out.

Location: The incident happened near Junction 5 of the M1, close to Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire

Recovery operation: One man allegedly fell to his death from a bridge, while a Good Samaritan driver who went to help him was fatally hit by another car

A silver Audi saloon car was last night seen being towed from  the scene.

Rupert
 Gadd, from the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire police 
road crash investigation unit, said: ‘A male is known to have jumped 
from the bridge parapet on to the carriageway.

'Another car stopped and a man got out to help and was hit by another car'

Rebecca Martin, witness

‘Other motorists have stopped to assist – unfortunately one of those people who stopped was struck by another vehicle.’

A Hertfordshire police spokesman said both carriageways were later reopened. She appealed for witnesses to come forward.

The
 East of England ambulance service said it received a 999 call at 
10.48am and had its first rapid response car on the scene in under three
 minutes.

A spokesman said: ‘We sent two ambulances and a response vehicle, a volunteer doctor and the Hertfordshire air ambulance.

He added: ‘All of our resources were stood down shortly  after midday.’
