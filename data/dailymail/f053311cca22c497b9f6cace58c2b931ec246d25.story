Two pet dogs which savaged and killed a six-day-old baby girl were killed by police yesterday.

Eliza-Mae Mullane had been back from hospital just three days when she was mauled by her own family's animals - an Alaskan malamute named Nisha and Roxy, a terrier.

Police seized the two animals - whom some speculated were jealous of the attention given to the newborn - but they were kept alive while forensic tests were carried out.

Killed: Eliza-Mae was killed by dogs just six days after she was born. The attack happened on February 18 in Pontyberem, Wales

Following a post-mortem on baby Eliza-Mae, of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, officers decided the dogs were no longer needed, and could be humanely killed.

Police sources, however, confirmed that the dogs were involved in the killing and that the parents were not being investigated - which suggests that the dogs are solely responsible for the killing.

Following the incident on February 18, it was reported that Eliza-Mae's mother Sharon John, 42, ran to neighbours in shock shouting: 'The dog ate my baby’s head.'

A police spokesman said: 'We can 
confirm that the file concerning the death of Eliza-Mae Mullane has now 
been passed to the Coroner for Carmarthenshire.

'We can also confirm the two family dogs taken into possession by the police at the time have now been destroyed.'

Parents: Sharon John, 42, and Patrick Mullane, 35, said their daughter 'will always be in our hearts and thoughts'

Tributes: Eliza-Mae was killed at home, where tributes were left in the wake of the incident

Ms John and her partner Patrick Mullane, 35, said Eliza-Mae’s death 'cast the most horrible shadow' over the family.

They said: 'Even though she was an important part of our family for such a short period of time, Eliza-Mae will always be in our hearts and thought.

'We will cherish the little time we were able to share with her. She was a dearly loved daughter, sister, grand-daughter and niece.

'She brought joy into our family, and losing her like this has cast the most horrible shadow over all of us.'

'There are no words we can use to describe what we feel at the moment, and we don’t think there ever will be.'

Incident: Eliza-Mae and her family lived in Pontyberem, Wales

At the time neighbour Patricia Punter, 71, said: 'It was terrible - I’ve never heard anything like it. Sharon was in a state of shock and just screaming.

'She just kept on saying: “The dog ate my baby’s head. He’s blaming me for it - the baby’s gone.'

Ms John had terrier Roxy for years before Mr Mullane brought the Alaskan malamute home after a night at the pub.

Neighbours said the husky had been behaving strangely after the baby came home from hospital. Ms John also has two other children - Harley, five, and Lily-Rose, three.

The family was yesterday planning a funeral service for little Eliza-Mae. A full inquest will be held later this year.
