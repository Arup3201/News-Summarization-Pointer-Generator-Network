The married 71-year-old owner of the Dallas Cowboys is the subject of an alleged extortion plot, it has emerged, after photographs of a man who appears to be Jerry Jones in compromising positions with young women were published online.

The photos published over the
weekend in a strange 20-page manifesto attributed to a Dallas 'entrepreneur',
claim to show Jones grabbing one blonde woman's breasts. In another shot,
a brunette woman on her knees grins as she leans her head against the man's
pelvic area.

The man who published the photos, that have appeared in several publications including the Huffington Post, claims they were taken by someone else to extort Jones, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion.

Jones has not yet issued a statement on the pictures.

Blackmail? The photos were released by a Dallas man who says they were taken to extort Jones. Above, another shot that allegedly shows Jones with a woman who is not his wife

Jones appears to be in a restroom with both women in the two pictures.

The photos are potentially especially scandalous considering Jones has been married to his 72-year-old wife Gene for 50 years.

They have three adult children 
together: sons Stephen and Jerry Jr and a daughter Charlotte. All three 
of their children work for the Dallas Cowboys company and the couple 
have nine grandchildren.

Jones is described as a 'dedicated businessman and family man' on the Cowboy's official website.

The photos emerged in
connection with a manifesto posted online titled 'Uncovering the Truth' which
has 'For: Jerry Jones' written on the cover.  A link to the  report was  tweeted to several news outlets on August 3.

According to the
manifesto, the pictures were taken by a different person to blackmail
Jones, but the manifesto strays into theories about numerology and he also calls
himself the 'Son of God'. 

Sources told Deadspin that the man who tweeted the link to the report 'used to be fairly well connected in Dallas' and would often attend parties with Cowboys and Mavericks players. 

MailOnline's calls to the Cowboys organization for comment were not immediately returned Tuesday night.

What were they doing? Another image released online doesn't include Jones, but appears to show the woman he grabbed in one of the other photos
