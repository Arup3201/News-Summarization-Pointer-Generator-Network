A playful dog found himself in a rather tight spot after he got his head stuck in an air vent.

Eight-month-old border collie Jasper was left with his head wedged through a wall after exploring his home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

Worried owner Sharon Hourihan tried everything to free her pet - including covering him in washing-up liquid and dog shampoo in a bid to slide his neck out of the 3in gap.

When Jasper's head wouldnt budge, frantic Miss Hourihan called in RSPCA officers - who in turn called out vets and fire crews in a multi-service operation to free him

But when Jasper's head wouldn't budge, Miss Hourihan called in RSPCA officers, who in turn called out vets and fire crews in a multi-service operation to free playful Jasper.

The dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring and found himself stuck.

Miss Hourihan said: 'I'd let Jasper out in the garden to play just before I went round to see my friend.

'I
 called him, and thought it was strange when he didn't come straight 
away. We have only had him a few weeks, but he doesn't really go far 
from my side.

'I wandered a 
bit further down the garden and just saw his little head poking out of 
the wall. He was bright eyed, and wasn't in any distress, and my first 
instinct was to laugh at him as he just looked so ridiculous.

'However,
 when I realised he was stuck, and he couldn't move his head out, I 
started to panic. I tried covering him in shampoo, in the hope we could 
slide his neck out, but nothing worked.'

Tight spot: Firefighters rescuing Jasper the dog after he got his head stuck in an air vent

RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'This was certainly one of the more unusual rescues I have been called to attend'

After more than an hour of trying to free Jasper, desperate Miss Hourihan gave in and called an RSPCA helpline. But local inspectors were stumped as to how to rescue Jasper - and called in local vets.

Miss Hourihan said: 'By this time, my little boy, Alex, eight, was really worried about Jasper, and started crying.

'Then Jasper started getting quite distressed, but the vets couldn't get him out either - so it was time to call for the fire brigade.'

All smiles now: The dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring

Vet Tom Foster sedated Jasper to prevent him from injuring himself while fire crews cut away at the wall, creating a big enough gap for Jasper to be lifted free.

Mr Foster said:  'Jasper was getting distressed by his situation and was putting up a fight so he needed to be sedated to stop him injuring himself.

'After he was sedated he was snoring! His head was down and he was asleep which made it easier for the rescuers to work round him and I stayed to make sure he was stable. I can say this was one of the strangest cases I had been called out to deal with.'

Miss Hourihan added: 'Jasper was checked over by the vet and was right as rain, and we're just pleased he's ok.

'He was a bit wobbly on his feet for a few hours, but by the next day he was right as rain and you'd never know anything had happened to him.

'You'd think he would have learned his lesson, but I do have to keep an eye on him - because his favourite place to go and play now is the hole in the wall left by the fire service!'

Crew Manager at Highfields Fire Station, Nige Northern said: 'We were called in from Hucknall and Highfields Fire Stations because all other efforts to extricate the dog had failed and our specialist equipment was required.

'We attend rescue incidents of this nature to make sure that people do not put themselves at risk by getting into dangerous situations or using inappropriate tools.  I'm glad to hear the dog is recovering well from its ordeal.'

RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'This was certainly one of the more unusual rescues I have been called to attend. Fortunately despite his ordeal Jasper was fine and I just want to thank everyone who took part in the rescue.'
