One of the UK’s biggest internet firms has admitted there is no ‘social or moral framework’ on the internet, putting children at risk.

Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, told MPs that the online world was a ‘double-edged sword’ for youngsters and that ‘internet safety is the road safety of our generation’.

Charities have warned that rising numbers of children are falling victim to ‘cyberbullying’ and being exposed to online pornography.

Miss Harding said the dangers that youngsters encounter online are just as disturbing as being bullied in the playground

Miss Harding said the dangers that youngsters encounter online are just as disturbing as being bullied in the playground but the risks are far ‘less visible’.

TalkTalk, which has 4million UK subscribers, was the first provider to allow parents to impose anti-pornography filters for all internet access in their home.

But speaking to the Commons Culture Select Committee yesterday, Miss Harding admitted that more could be done by internet firms.

‘The number of things that can happen to a child online are just as many as can happen to a child in the playground – only it’s more immediate and they’ve got the whole world at their fingertips,’ she said.

‘On bullying I don’t think that the fundamental issues are any different from being in the playground.

‘The adult supervising the playground has a role to play, the children have a role to play as do their parents and there’s a big public awareness challenge … because it’s so much less visible than your child being physically bullied in the playground.’

Some 1.2million TalkTalk customers are signed up to its filters, but Miss Harding warned that no filter could block everything, and that education in schools was vitally important

Miss Harding added: ‘The social and moral framework for the digital world doesn’t exist yet, so I do think there is an important role for legislators to play in thinking through … absolute black and white rules that we need to put in place.

‘There is a clear role for the owners or builders of the playgrounds, whether that’s the social networking sites or the internet service providers to think through how to provide children, parents, teachers with the tools to keep the environment safe.’

The Daily Mail has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn, with adults only able to access it after an age verification check. In the summer David Cameron announced that, for the first time, all homes would be asked if they want to impose an anti-porn filter.

Some 1.2million TalkTalk customers are signed up to its filters, but Miss Harding warned that no filter could block everything, and that education in schools was vitally important.

‘Internet safety is the road safety of our generation,’ she said. ‘When I was a child there was Clunk Click, we had the Green Cross Code, seat belts were just being rolled out into cars, the airbag hadn’t yet been invented.

‘There was a whole load of public awareness and education in schools.’

Miss Harding added: ‘We at TalkTalk have lobbied to see internet safety on the primary curriculum and we’re delighted to see that it will be coming in.’

Nicholas Lansman, secretary general of the Internet Service Providers’ Association, said: ‘Technology alone is not the only solution and education and awareness is fundamental to the process.’

Last night Labour peer Lord Sugar called for Ofcom’s remit to be widened. The star of BBC show The Apprentice said the watchdog should be a ‘full-blown regulator’ for the internet, protecting children from harmful material online.

÷THE former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre warned that ‘sexualised’ pop stars such as Miley Cyrus have more effect on children than porn.

Jim Gamble said that unlike online porn there was no filter to control youngsters watching such celebrities.

He said the behaviour of Miley Cyrus and other stars ‘has a far greater and much more easily accessible influence on young people today than actually seeing adult, or hardcore pornography’.
