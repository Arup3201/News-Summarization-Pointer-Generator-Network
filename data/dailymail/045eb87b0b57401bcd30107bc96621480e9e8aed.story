With just 16 more sleeps until the Barclays Premier League season kicks off, excitement is building as we eagerly await the new campaign.

For now, we make do with the warm-up matches, offering glimpses of what we can expect to see in just over two weeks time. Some stars are already shining bright, scoring goals and frightening defences.

Apologies in advance if it is all a deception, but here are the five players that Sportsmail expect to take the Premier League by storm this time around.

New man: Chelsea's £32million signing Diego Costa has begun his career with Jose Mourinho's side in style

Phil Jones (Manchester United)

The 22-year-old has suffered from his own versatility and enthusiasm for the team ethic in recent times, often being deployed at right back or central midfield. In truth, these positions do not do justice to an English centre half of giant potential.

Sir Alex Ferguson bought him as a centre-back and intended to mould him in that position. As it transpired, three seasons on, Jones has started only 16 times at the heart of the United defence.

Under Louis van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system, Jones is assured a place as part of the back three and now faces a major test of his credential. So far, so good though - United have not conceded in pre-season when Jones has been on the pitch.

Erik Lamela (Tottenham)

The marquee signing to replace Gareth Bale, considered one of the finest young talents in the world game, but he endured a traumatic first campaign with Spurs.

Lamela's only 90 mutes in the Premier League came in the 6-0 thrashing by Manchester City at The Etihad Stadium and he did not appear in a Tottenham shirt following the turn of the year.

The Argentine, who struggled with injuries in the second half of the season, is desperate to turn things round and prove himself in the Premier League.

He scored twice in the victory over Toronto and manager Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking positively of Lamela's attitude and quality - but they will both know that sterner tests await upon their return to England.

Raheem Sterling (Liverpool)

One of the few England players to emerge from the World Cup with their reputation enhanced, Sterling has picked up from where he left off last season.

A goal against Manchester City capped a fine performance and with Luis Suarez gone and Liverpool looking a touch light in the forward positions, there is an opportunity for Sterling to emerge as Liverpool's talisman, dribbling with confidence, committing opponents and taking responsibility.

If he remains fit, he could double last season's return of 10 goals.

Stevan Jovetic (Manchester City)

Four goals in two games against AC Milan and Liverpool in the USA is almost as many as the six that Jovetic managed in the whole of last season.

Clearly, Jovetic is a man on a mission, determined to revive his Manchester City career after a first season punctuated by muscle injuries and frequent setbacks, as the Serbian started only two Premier League games.

In his previous life in Italy, he was compared to Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Baggio, and it is telling that Manuel Pellegrini, despite his frustrations with Jovetic last season, would not countenance selling him to Inter Milan this summer.

City believe they have one of the planet's most inventive forwards on their hands and with Alvaro Negredo injured, he will be handed the chance to battle with Edin Dzeko for a place alongside the brilliant Sergio Aguero.

Diego Costa (Chelsea)

The brawny frontman has made an instant impact in a Chelsea shirt, opening his account against Olimpija Ljubijana and then laying on assists for Mohamed Salah and Nemanja Matic in the victory over Vitesse Arnhem on Wednesday evening.

Thirty-five goals for Atletico Madrid last season and Costa looks set to shatter the narrative of the Roman Abramovich years, where big name strikers such as Mateja Kezman, Andriy Shevchenko, Hernan Crespo and Fernando Torres have all failed to shine in the blue shirt.
