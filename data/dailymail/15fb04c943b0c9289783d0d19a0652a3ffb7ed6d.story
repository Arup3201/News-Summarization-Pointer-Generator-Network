Three teenagers will be charged with manslaughter by Dutch prosecutors for allegedly taking part in an attack on a linesman at a youth football match.

Volunteer linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen died in hospital on Monday, a day after he was allegedly beaten and kicked by players from Amsterdam team Nieuw Sloten.

Mr Nieuwenhuizen’s son had been playing in the game, which was held in the town of Almere.

Attack: Linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen died after he was allegedly attacked by three teenage footballers

And prosecutors said the three males, 
two 15 and one 16, would be arraigned on Thursday on charges of 
manslaughter, assault and public violence. Their identities were not 
released.

Mr Nieuwenhuizen’s
 team, Buitenboys, have not announced the exact cause of his death, but 
Dutch TV station RTL said he had brain damage.

Mr
 Nieuwenhuizen left after Sunday’s match and was not aware anything was 
wrong. He returned to his club later that night and collapsed.

‘You can’t believe this could happen.
 That kids of 15 or 16 are playing football, you come to watch and see 
something like that,’ said Buitenboys chairman Marcel Oost.

‘He did it every week. He enjoyed doing it. He was a real football man - he was always here.’

FIFA president Sepp Blatter said in a statement he was ‘deeply shocked’ by Mr Nieuwenhuizen’s death.

‘I would like to express my sadness and distress on hearing of the death of assistant referee Richard Nieuwenhuizen,’ he said.

‘I was deeply shocked to learn of this tragic incident.

‘Football is a mirror of society and, 
sadly, the same ills that afflict society - in this case violence - also
 manifest themselves in our game.

‘Nevertheless, I remain convinced that 
football - through the example set by the tireless efforts of people 
like Mr Nieuwenhuizen - is a force for good, and we must continue use 
its positive example to educate people against these wrongs.’

Sadness: The whole of Dutch football has been left shocked by the news

Respect: Buitenboys fly their flag at half mast

Dutch sports minister Edith Schippers 
said: ‘It is absolutely terrible that something like this can happen on a
 Dutch sports field.’

Meanwhile, all amateur fixtures in Holland have been postponed this weekend as a mark of respect to Mr Nieuwenhuizen.

The Dutch Football Association, the KNVB,
 announced all amateur games this weekend have been called off while 
professional matches will be preceded by a minute’s silence with all 
players and referees involved wearing black armbands.

KNVB director of professional football 
Bert van Oostveen said: ‘It is inconceivable that anything like this 
occurs on a football field.

'These are the volunteers that we build our sport on, that we cannot do without. Without respect, no football.

‘That is why we in professional football want to show our support in this terrible situation.

‘Our thoughts go out to the family of Richard Nieuwenhuizen.’
