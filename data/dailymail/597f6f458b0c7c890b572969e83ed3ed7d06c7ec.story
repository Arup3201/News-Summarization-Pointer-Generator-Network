Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher hopes the hard-fought 2-0 win over Yeovil will be a game to look back on if Louis van Gaal's side go on to win the FA Cup.

A stunning finish from Ander Herrera helped United edge past a resolute Yeovil and into the fourth round.

An out-of-sorts United side, which included captain Wayne Rooney, David De Gea and Radamel Falcao, toiled for over an hour against their struggling hosts until a piece of individual brilliance set them on their way to a 2-0 win.

Herrera marked his FA Cup debut with a thumping 64th-minute effort that left Yeovil goalkeeper Jed Steer clutching at thin air before Angel Di Maria clipped in a second late on.

'We knew it wasn't going to be easy,' Fletcher told BT Sport 1.

'It was going to be difficult with tackles flying in. You have to battle before you win the match and we did that today. We battled for 60, 70 minutes and then Ander scored a spectacular goal and sometimes that's what it takes.

'The longer you can keep possession, although it was difficult, the more you tire the opposition out and you can win the game in the last 20 minutes. We knew it was going to be difficult but we're in the draw for the next round.' 

The last time United won the FA Cup was in 2004, and Fletcher added: 'It's been too long since Man United have won this competition.

'We really want to win it this year and hopefully we'll look back on our result here as one of the most important ones if we go far in the competition.'
