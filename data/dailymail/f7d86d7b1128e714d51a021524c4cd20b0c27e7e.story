The younger brother of Vice President Joe Biden was hospitalized after he opened a package from India containing a white powder that was initially thought to be anthrax.

Francis Biden, 57, was at his Boynton Beach, Florida, home on Saturday when we received the Manila envelope, which was addressed to him.

When he opened it, his skin came into contact with a suspicious white powder and he immediately contacted authorities who evacuated the neighbours and took him to hospital, where he was held overnight.

His girlfriend Mindy was also taken but was released later that day.

'She retrieved the envelope but I was the one who opened it. It came from India,' Mr Biden told the Palm Beach Post.

'I was the only one who came in contact with the powder so they kept me in hospital. I’m fine.'

He did not say whether or not anything else was in the envelope and referred the matter to the FBI, who later declared the contents of the package to be 'not threatening in nature' based on preliminary tests.

There was no immediate comment from the vice president’s office regarding the incident involving his brother.

Frank Biden is the president of a real-estate development and consulting firm based in Florida.

He is currently an active supporter of the 
Obama-Biden administration and their re-election campaign.

In late 2001, anthrax mailings rattled 
an already jittery American public just days after Al-Qaeda militants 
hijacked passenger jets and plunged them into the World Trade Centre and
the Pentagon, killing almost 3,000 people.

U.S. government scientist Bruce Ivins 
committed suicide in July 2008 as FBI agents were about to bring charges
against him over the anthrax campaign, which killed five people and 
injured 17. Some of the victims were in southern Florida.
