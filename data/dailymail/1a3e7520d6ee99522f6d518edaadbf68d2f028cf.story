Behind Margaret Thatcher’s public shield of unyielding confidence there was one area of private doubt: what kind of mother had she been?

She had no misgivings about making her twins Mark and Carol, born when she was 27, fit in with her professional and political life. They slept in the nanny’s room from the day they were brought home.

As Lady Thatcher said in her 1996 memoir The Path To Power: ‘To be a mother and housewife is a vocation of a very high kind. But I simply felt that it was not the whole of my vocation. I knew that I also wanted a career.’

Countless women with ambition go through the same emotional wringer. As things turned out, she doted on Mark, the elder by two minutes, but developed an awkward relationship with the more independent Carol.

Mark ended up with a fortune, widely perceived to have come about simply because he was Margaret Thatcher’s much-loved son.

But there is plenty of evidence to show that even though she wasn’t as close to Carol, she loved and cared for her every bit as much, especially in her desire to see her married — a dream that was never fulfilled.

According to one friend, the difference in her maternal relationships with her children — born in 1953 when she was a barrister, six years before she entered Parliament — was that she ‘calculated that Carol was tougher than Mark and therefore needed less of a push’.

The root of journalist Carol’s uneasy relationship with her mother was her dismay, held since early childhood, that Mark was the favourite.

‘As a child I was frightened of her,’ she has said. ‘I always felt I came second of the two. Unloved is not the right word, but I never felt I made the grade.’

In the mid-Nineties, when Carol was 43 and Mark was married to his first wife Diane and living with their children in South Africa, Carol let out her feelings of frustration and inadequacy.

‘Mark is married to a beautiful girl, has two fabulous children and various mansions scattered around the world.

‘I’m an ancient spinster of no fixed abode living in a rented holiday flat in a ski resort. I still don’t measure up awfully well on the Richter scale.’   

A lifetime of frustration is encompassed in this outpouring. And it is hard not to conclude the blame for this must lie with Mrs Thatcher.

As the late Tory grandee Woodrow Wyatt noted: ‘A different note comes into her (Thatcher’s) voice when she speaks about Mark. She obviously dotes on him.’

The result, perhaps, was inevitable — a daughter who felt second best. Margaret and businessman Denis had been married for two years when the twins (only one child was expected) were born while their father was watching cricket at the Oval.

With their parents working — Margaret was attached to legal chambers in Lincoln’s Inn and Denis travelled a lot — the babies were put into the care of a full-time nanny.

Somewhat bitterly, Carol noted in her memoir: ‘I don’t think they (her parents) can have relished being in charge on nanny’s day off.’

The twins were five in 1958 when Mrs Thatcher was adopted as the Conservative candidate for Finchley, the safe North London constituency she would win the following year and represent until leaving Parliament in 1992.

So was Mark and Carol’s childhood really as sterile as has been made out? Far from it. There were riding lessons and skiing holidays, and their mother established a lifelong rule about family weekends.

As Sir Bernard Ingham, her No 10 private secretary, recalls: ‘She’d often say “weekends are for the family” and would never disturb me unless there was a running crisis.’

Years later, Mrs Thatcher, who had grown up in a ‘frugal and very purposeful household’ above her father’s grocer’s shop in Grantham, Lincs, told the adult Carol she’d wanted her children ‘to have the opportunities I hadn’t had’.

As Carol recalled: ‘When it came to being a mother, she [gave] Mark and me the opportunity to make up our own minds. That meant anything from being allowed to choose the wallpaper in our bedrooms [which Mrs Thatcher always decorated herself] to church being optional each Sunday.’

Sir Bernard says: ‘Margaret used to say: “I’m not the kind of nurse that says: ‘There, there, I’ll fluff up the pillows.’ I’m the kind who gets [the children] out of bed after the operation because it’s for their own good.” ’

By the time they were sent to boarding school — Mark at eight, Carol at nine — they were so used to their mother being away at work that neither suffered from home sickness.

Yet Carol would never forget that when she won a prize on sports day, neither parent was there to see her receive it.

As for Mark, he may have been ‘mummy’s boy’, but she was not soft with him. When he wanted to drop out of skiing lessons because he was cold, she refused to allow it.

‘She said he would be perfectly fine and had to suffer,’ recalls a family friend. ‘He didn’t like it.’Sir Bernard has no doubt that while Mrs Thatcher was hardly a conventional parent, ‘she was certainly a caring and loving mother’.

And there is no doubt that, as Carol recalled, her mother ‘fell apart . . . completely unable to function’ when Mark went missing for six days in 1982 in the Sahara while driving in the Paris-Dakar rally.   

Just how far Mrs Thatcher was prepared to take her love for Mark has, for years, been a matter of speculation.

From having failed his accountancy exams and struggling to establish himself in business, Mark Thatcher suddenly emerged in the late Eighties as a multi-millionaire.

Reports have suggested he was enriched with huge commissions as a silent middle man in arms and construction deals negotiated in the Arab states by his mother.

Of course, Mrs Thatcher was not complicit in her son’s business arrangements. She implacably denied there had been any impropriety or that her son had grown rich on the back of her efforts for Britain.

As Baroness Thatcher reached the final years of her life, she saw divorced Mark happily remarried, while Carol remained single.

There was surprise, and some distaste, when Carol’s memoir, published five years ago, discussed her mother’s dementia and revealed she couldn’t remember what she’d had for breakfast that morning.

Nor did Sir Mark or Carol spend as much time in their frail and forgetful mother’s company — especially at Christmas — as friends felt they should. Their visits to her Belgravia home were rare.   

‘Look, you can’t have everything,’ an elderly Margaret Thatcher said some years ago in a revealing interview with retirement magazine Saga.

‘It has been the greatest privilege being Prime Minister of my country . . . Yes, I wish I saw more of my children. We don’t have Sunday lunch together; we don’t go on holiday skiing any  more. ‘But I can’t regret. And I haven’t lost my children. They have their lives. I took a different life.’
