Americans are searching the web for information about North Korea with astonishing frequency, vastly outstripping those for Barack Obama and Beyonce, it emerged today.

Google searches for the pariah state, which has the world on high alert over its nuclear ambitions, are seven times the previous peak in 2006 when it carried out an atom bomb test.

Last week, the term 'North Korea' was the third-most popular on Twitter, only behind Easter and Good Friday.

Not so interesting: Search terms for North Korea are also outstripping those for President Barack Obama, seen here with Beyonce at his swearing-in ceremony in January

Interest in Kim Jong Un's communist regime doesn't normally come close to those of pop stars and presidents.

But a graph from Google Trends shows how the frequency with which users are searching for North Korea has spiked dramatically over the last two weeks.

Its peak came on April 4 when it announced it would restart its plutonium nuclear plant having earlier released a 'strike plan' purporting to show places on the U.S. mainland it could hit with its missiles.

At that point, searches were almost ten times more frequent than President Obama and Beyonce.

According to The Washington Post, a poll by the Pew Research Centre estimates that 36 per cent of Americans are following the news on North Korea 'very closely', with 56 per cent saying the U.S. should take its warmongering 'very seriously'.

Of those, around 47 per cent believe North Korea has the ability to launch a nuclear missile that can hit the United States.

A Pentagon agency did nothing to calm those fears today after the accidental release of a secret report suggested Kim Jong Un may indeed be able to launch a nuclear-armed missile at its enemies.

The Obama administration quickly sought to play down the threat and the consensus inside the U.S. government is that North Korea does not yet have a nuclear device that would fit longer-range missiles which conceivably could reach U.S. territories.

It is not even clear whether it has the ability to place one on medium and short-range weapons, given the technological challenges in making a device small enough and robust enough to be blasted on a rocket.

The Pew poll also found that 59 per cent think Kim Jong Un is willing to follow through on his threat to attack the West.

However, nearly all North Korea analysts believe he has no such desire to do so, saying that he is simply seeking concessions from the West or attempting to consolidate his power.
