Once grown only in the sun-drenched Mediterranean climate, melons are now arriving fresh from the fields of Britain.

Farmers in Kent and Staffordshire are about to deliver thousands of cantaloupes and galias to the major supermarkets.

They are using polytunnels in which strawberries are produced earlier in the year.

Ready to eat: The first pick of Magenta melons, which look similar to Cantaloupe melons (pictured), were harvested last week and supplied to local fruit markets in Kent

Adaptation: Farmers have been growing melons in the polytunnels used for this year's strawberries

Pleased as punch: Melon farmers Tony Frankham and Beverley Hawkins with the first British crop of cantaloupe melons grown at Newmafruit farm

Most of the melons imported to the UK
from Italy, Spain and southern France are harvested before they ripen 
and treated with chemicals to prevent them spoiling during transport.

By contrast, those grown in this country are picked when ripe and will be in the shops within a few days.

This suggests that they should be particularly tasty and healthy.

Marks & Spencer is about to take delivery of melons grown in Staffordshire.

The chain’s fruit expert, Bill 
Davies, said: ‘These British melons are a win-win fruit for our 
customers, who have delicious fruit, and our farmers who can reuse the 
valuable land that is left once the strawberry crop has finished.’

The Kent company Newmafruit, based near Canterbury, is harvesting its first crop of 5,000 cantaloupes this year.

Juicy: Experts say the British melons are likely to be tastier and healthier because they are so ripe

Cash crops: Newmafruit specialises in apples and pears and supplies 26 varieties of apple and six of pear, plus cherries, plums and soft fruit to UK supermarkets

They will be sold through Morrisons and Co-op stores, with hopes of expansion.

The company’s managing director, Tony
Frankham, said: ‘The early indications are this has been very 
successful. The melons are looking absolutely fantastic.’

The fact that warm weather crops can 
now be grown in this country is seen as evidence of both improvements in
farming techniques and a change in the climate.

The chalk slopes of southern Britain 
are producing excellent grapes and wine, while sweetcorn is grown on a 
significant scale as far north as Yorkshire.

M&S expects to receive five tons of British apricots, which would normally be grown in France, from a Kent farm.

Newmafruit Farms Ltd and Newmafruit International Ltd manage over 1300 acres of orchard and soft fruit production, with extensive warehousing, storage and packing facilities.

The company handles over 60,000 tonnes of product a year, the majority of which consists of 26 varieties of apple and six of pear, plus cherries, plums and soft fruit.
