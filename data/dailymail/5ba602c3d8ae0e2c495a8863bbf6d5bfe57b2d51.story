Love is in the air, alcohol is flowing, everyone looks fabulous and the band is wooing you all on to the dance floor: all singletons know weddings are a great place to meet other people looking for romance.

Trouble is, if you spend the meal sandwiched between Great Uncle Godfrey, 98, and a dashing gentleman showing you iPhotos of his beloved wife who, being in her third trimester, couldn't fly to Bora Bora for the nuptials, finding that special someone can be a mite more complex.

Enter celebrity property developer Sarah Beeny and her lauded dating website MySingleFriend.com, who have launched a special service to spread the love during wedding season: MySingleTable.

Moreover, 83 per cent of single men and 69 per cent of 
single women would like the bride and groom to let them know about other
 single people attending their wedding.

Nick commented: 'If our friends hadn't encouraged us to go on MySingleFriend.com I wouldn't be marrying the woman of my dreams.

'We are big fans of the site and the idea of matchmaking our single friends at our wedding through MySingleTable.

'What a great way for our friends to share in our special day and brilliant for them to check out who's coming, and have a chance at finding a date.'
