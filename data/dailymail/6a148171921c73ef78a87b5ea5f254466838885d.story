A smaller version of HTC's One handset - dubbed HTC One Mini - could be released as early as 9 August.

A tech analyst leaked the date on Twitter, and if the rumours turn out to be true, it would see HTC releasing the scaled-down phone only four months after its full-sized predecessor. 

The user, @ViziLeaks, tweeted: '#HTC #OneMini #M4 hits UK stores 9th August 2013.'

Leaked images of the HTC One Mini handset, pictured, suggest the phone will have 4.3-inch screen and come in black and white. A release date has also been leaked, suggesting the handset will go on sale on 9 August

The Mini is widely reported as having a 4.3-inch, 1280x720p HD display, a 1.4GHz dual-core processor with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.

It
is also tipped to run Google’s latest Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean OS, 
although the software is likely to come with a skin to make it look like
HTC's Sense user interface.

Like the HTC One, the Mini is expected to made from brushed aluminium.

The HTC One Mini is also believed to be fitted with a 4-UltraPixel rear-mounted camera and 
BoomSound stereo speakers already seen on the HTC One.

Vizleaks recently correctly predicted Nokia would launch the Lumia 1020 last week and is considered an accurate source for tech releases.

Leaked pictures of the handset recently emerged suggesting the phone would have a 4.3-inch screen and will come 
in black and white.

The images from AndroidNext were also bolstered with what was said to be an official infographic from the Korean phone maker hinting at a new, smaller HTC One release. 

HTC hasn't formally unveiled the handset or its specifications yet but the Mini is widely reported as having a 1280x720p HD display, a 1.4GHz dual-core processor with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.

The HTC One Mini rumours were bolstered by a leaked infographic, pictured, suggesting the Taiwanese firm would soon be announcing a 'little thing that packs a big punch'

It is also tipped to run Google’s latest Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean OS, although the software is likely to come with a skin to make it look like HTC's Sense user interface.

The HTC One Mini is also believed to be fitted with a 4-UltraPixel rear-mounted camera and 
BoomSound stereo speakers already seen on the HTC One.

If HTC does release a smaller model this would follow in the steps of Samsung, which is famous for releasing a Galaxy Mini handset three or four months after launching its full-sized version.

On the other end of the scale, more rumours suggest HTC will also announce a device in September dubbed HTC Max that is a cross between a phone and a tablet, or phablet.

The device will have a 5.9-inch HD display, according to technology site Mobile Geeks.

It will have a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM and up to 64GB of storage.

This would put the phablet in direct competition with the Samsung Galaxy Note, but it is unknown if if the HTC One Max will come with a stylus, like the Note.
