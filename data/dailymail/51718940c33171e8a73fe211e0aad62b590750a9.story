For a few seconds during the victory at Southampton, Spurs fans burst into a chorus of: ‘There’s only one Harry Redknapp’.

It was probably meant to be a taunt to the home fans, relegated under Redknapp in 2005, rather than a yearning for their former boss.

But it had extra resonance on a day when Tim Sherwood celebrated his first win as manager.

Same again: Tim Sherwood served under Harry Redknapp and now hopes to emulate his former boss now that he is in charge of Tottenham

Spurs have not won a Premier League game at home since the end of October when they beat Hull City 1-0.

Redknapp was the Spurs boss who invited Sherwood back to the club he served as a player and set him on a coaching pathway that has led to the hot-seat at White Hart Lane.

And it has not gone unnoticed that his first two games have seen the team perform with the same spirit of adventure that was the hallmark of Redknapp’s Tottenham, who twice finished in the top four.

‘That’s got to be a compliment hasn’t it?’ said Sherwood (right), who was confirmed as permanent successor to Andre Villas-Boas on Monday. 

New man in charge: Sherwood will lead Tottenham until the end of the 2014/15 season after succeeding AVB

‘I wouldn’t mind following his career. I wouldn’t mind being a pound note behind him as well.’

His manner, too, is closer to Redknapp than Villas-Boas: quick with a one-liner and not as anxious to appear deep as AVB.

‘They can be all doom and gloom if they want,’ replied Sherwood when asked how he thought this sense of fun might be seen by Spurs fans. ‘I’m going to do it my way. I’m going to be myself.

‘I’m not trying to be Harry Redknapp but it’s a simple game, isn’t it? If you can’t pass the ball to your own team-mates, then you have a serious problem because you are going to have to keep on defending. That’s what we did in the first half at Southampton. But moving forward we just have to try to get the players better.’

Smiles better: Sherwood got off to a winning start in the Premier League at Southampton last weekend and will now hope to defeat West Brom at home on Boxing Day

Sherwood impressed chairman Daniel Levy during his time in charge of Tottenham’s youth development programme and billed himself as the man to restore the traditions of the club to play dashing football.

‘I want the players to enjoy what they’re doing,’ said the former England midfielder, 44.

‘There are pressures but it either goes for you or it doesn’t.  What’s the worst that can happen? You get the sack.’
