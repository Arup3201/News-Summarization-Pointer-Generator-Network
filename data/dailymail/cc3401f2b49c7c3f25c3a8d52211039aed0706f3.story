A businessman tried to carry out a £42,000 insurance fraud by claiming his 'tatty and dull' Bentley was a different car which he had photographed during a test drive.

Peter Webb, 56, paid just £3,700 for what was described as a 'tatty and dull' Bentley Mark VI which he planned to use for his wedding chauffeur business.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how he insured the car in February 2011 for £42,000, only to report it stolen two months later from a garage near his home.

Webb told his insurance company Grouparama Insurances that his valuation of the car was accurate as he had splashed out £38,000 in cash on restoring it from scrap.

When the insurers became suspicious and demanded to see the invoices, paperwork and pictures of the restoration work, he insisted it was all in the boot of the stolen car.

Webb then tried to prove his story by taking a fully restored 1950s Bentley Mark VI for a test drive from heritage motor dealers P & A Wood in Great Easton near Dunmow, Essex.

Unbeknown to staff at the showroom, he drove to a country lane where he fitted the immaculate Bentley with a different number plate showing the registration number of his car.

Webb, of Ipswich, then took a photograph of the car at the roadside before removing the fake number plate and returning the Bentley to the unsuspecting dealer.

He then submitted the photograph to his insurers along with another picture of the interior of a Bentley which he found on an internet advert.

Scam: Peter Webb took these photographs which he gave to investigators looking into his claim

Prosecutor Michael Crimp said his scam was uncovered when insurance investigators went on to Google and found the car in Webb's pictures was really the other vehicle in pristine condition.

A witness who carried out an MoT test on Webb's car in December 2010 described it as 'tatty and dull' and totally unlike the car in the photographs shown to the insurance company.

Webb, 56, admitted making a fraudulent insurance claim with the intention of gaining £42,000 and was fined £10,000.

He was also ordered to pay £1,000 prosecution costs, a £15 victim surcharge and £1,323 to the insurance company to cover the costs of their investigation.

Judge Rupert Overbury told him: 'You wanted to make sure you got as much from the insurance company as you possibly could.

'You inflated the car's value and obtained pictures by pretending to take the exact car for a test drive.

'Plainly you must have taken your number plates with you for that test drive and swapped them over and taken photographs.'

Engine Size:              4 1⁄2-litre

Production:               1946–1952

Number produced:  5208

Body style:                4-door saloon

Top speed:                     100 mph

Acceleration:                 0-60 mph in 15 seconds

Fuel consumption:  16.5 miles per gallon

The judge added that Webb had gained nothing from the scam as he had been caught out by the insurance company.

Michael Latham, defending, said Webb had initially bought the car to use for weddings and chauffeuring.

He said Webb's business interests had suffered as a result of the recession and he regretted his involvement in the fraud.

Webb was arrested at work after Groupama Insurances referred the case to the City of London Police's Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department.

He initially pleading not guilty, but later admitted the attempted fraud

Det Con Declan Malone, who led the City of London Police investigation, said: 'Webb thought he had a clever plan to claim a substantial five figure sum from his insurer with his story that his restored Bentley had been stolen.

'However, the insurers saw through his fraud and referred the case to us and we were quickly able to establish he had committed a crime. IFED will continue to bring insurance fraudsters to justice.'

Andrew Pagett, the counter fraud manager at Groupama Insurances said: 'This is an excellent result for both us and IFED.

'Groupama Insurances' dedicated Fraud Team became suspicious of this claim at an early stage because of inconsistencies in the customer's story, compounded by the lack of supporting documentation confirming the existence of his vehicle.

'We are grateful to IFED for pursuing this case and are extremely satisfied with the outcome which demonstrates the insurance industry's commitment to fight fraud and protect innocent policyholders.'

The Bentley Mark VI which was made between 1946 and 1952 was Britain's first post-war luxury car. Around 5,200 of the cars were made

A spokesman for P & A Wood refused to comment.
