A member of Peter Holmes a Court's wedding party has described the moment their tourist tram was hit by a freight train in Zimbabwe, killing one guest and injuring 19 others.

Holmes a Court, who was in Africa to marry his photographer fiancee Alissa Everett, was 'swollen in lots of places,' but not seriously injured in last week's horror accident. Ms Everett escaped unhurt.

'There were screams of terror, everything went flying,' a friend of the bride-to-be told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'The tram slid 200 to 300 yards, and people were thrown out.'

The paper named the dead man as American William Poovey, 44. His wife Kara was treated for a broken jaw in South Africa and is due home in New York this week.

As Mailonline reported on Monday, Mr Holmes a Court's best man Jason Gissing suffered a broken arm and leg in the horror accident.

The groom's younger brother, Paul Holmes a Court was on board with two of his school-aged children, one of whom sustained a broken arm.

'Our tourist tram was hit by a freight train as it was approaching a sort of shunting yard,' Paul Holmes a Court told The Australian. 'I don't know why we were on the same line at the same time.'

African media ran pictures of the freight train which crashed into the tourist tram carrying Peter Holmes a Court's wedding guests in Zimbabwe on Tuesday, July 1

The crash happened when a goods train ploughed into a National Railways of Zimbabwe tram that was carrying 30 tourists and 5 crew members at the Victoria Falls main station.

'Whilst the tram train was at the Victoria Falls main station, the train operator stopped intending to change the railway line and the tram train was hit from behind by a goods train which was coming from the same direction.' said Zimbabwe Republic Police national spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba, reported allafrica.com.

A National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman told Mailonline Holmes a Court was not on the train last Tuesday as it travelled to the stunning Victoria Falls, on the border with Zambia.

Africa Tourism Authority director Ross Kennedy said the 'thoughts, condolences and prayers . . . of the entire Victoria Falls tourism community . . .  go out to all the families of passengers involved, and especially to the family and friends, of the one passenger who so tragically passed away'.

Millionaire Jason Gissing, who was to be Holmes a Court's best man, was flown to South Africa after breaking his arm and a leg in the crash

He said the passengers on the tram were from the US, UK, the Netherlands and Australia.

They were staying at the Victoria Falls Hotel at the time of the accident and sightseeing ahead of the wedding.

Of the 20 injured, 18 were treated at the local hospital and two were flown to a hospital in Johannesberg where one of them died.

The wedding planned in Maun, Botswana was cancelled.

Mr Holmes a Court, 45, knows Mr Gissing from his Oxford University days, where he also met George Osborne, Britain's finance minister.

His family has close ties with Zimbabwe - Mr Holmes a Court's father, the late entrepreneur Robert, grew up in the African country.

'It is the most appalling disaster,' an associate of Mr Gissing said.

'Jason broke an arm and a leg. It’s very traumatic, but at least he is alive.

'He is being cared for by Professor Ken Boffard, who is one of the best trauma surgeons in the world.'

Mr Gissing was airlifted to Johannesburg, in neighbouring South Africa, for treatment.

Two days after the crash, Peter Holmes a Court appears to have tweeted that he was looking for a lawyer in Zimbabwe.

Alissa Everett is an award-winning American photographer who has covered conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Last year she photographed Peter Holmes a Court for a magazine article about his return to Zimbabwe to trace the history of his father, Robert, who died in 1990.

For their wedding gifts, she and Peter Holmes a Court asked that guests give monetary donations to a charity Ms Everett founded for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Prior to getting married in Zimbabwe, Holmes a Court intended to accompany Ms Everett on a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in 2012 she was 'violently ambushed'.

'I will be joining to carry her (heavy) camera bags, to write on her work, raise the profile of the projects and because I am not prepared to let my bride out of my sight,' he said in a post on their wedding gift registry site.

On June 30, Mr Holmes a Court posted a message about the forthcoming wedding describing Ms Everett as an 'amazing woman'.

Mr Holmes a Court's first wife, Divonne, and their four children live in Switzerland.

Mr Holmes a Court became executive chairman of South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2006 in a joint takeover with Gladiator star Russell Crowe.

After becoming CEO, he quit the post in 2008. He and Crowe currently own a 37.5 per cent share of the NRL club.

His close friend Mr Gissing, 43, is the co-founder of UK-based online grocer Ocado.  He stepped down from the board earlier this year, cashing in $27 million worth of shares.

Mr Gissing is married to Norwegian former professional skier Katinka. They live in a $8 million house in London’s Bayswater with their four children.

Zimbabwe’s railways are notoriously dangerous, with ageing despot Robert Mugabe having brought the country’s economy to its knees and unable to pay for improvements. The accident is the third involving National Railways of Zimbabwe in the space of a week.

The National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman declined to comment on whether legal action had been launched against it following the crash.
