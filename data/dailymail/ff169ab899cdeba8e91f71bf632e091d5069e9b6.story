Sour taste in the mouth: Tad Osborn, from Fort Collins, Colorado, was summoned to stand before a judge over claims his cheque for a dozen boxes bounced

A good Samaritan is facing court and $700 in fines for trying to buy a $42 batch of Girl Scout cookies, it emerged today.

Tad Osborn, from Fort Collins, Colorado, was summoned to stand before a judge after the youth organisation claimed his cheque for a dozen boxes of the doughy treat had bounced.

But the IT professional claims it could not have bounced because he has a healthy balance in an open and functioning bank account... and he says he can prove it.

'What did I do to deserve this? I just wrote the cheque,' he told CBS Denver. 'I was helping the Girl Scouts and now Iâ€™m having to go court over and over again and answering legal questions that I have no business answering.'

After purchasing the biscuits from a 
girl scout doing rounds in his local neighbourhood, he enjoyed them with
 his family last year.

But a few months later, he received a letter from a debt collection agency telling him the cheque could not be processed and that his bill had doubled to $82.

He called the local Girl Scout troop who directed him to its nerve centre in Denver.

'When someone called me back, they said my account was marked as closed.
 That was the first sign that we had a problem here, because my account 
was not closed,' he told ABCNews.

Instead, he blames an administrative error on the part of the Girl Scout's bank.

Rachelle Trujillo, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Colorado, declined to comment specifically about this case because of pending proceedings but said the cookie operation is like any other big business, selling 3.5 million cookies a year.

'When a cheque is reported as bad debt by a troop's bank, the troop attempts to contact the customer and the council then attempts to resolve the debt,' she said in a statement. 'Like any other business, after multiple attempts to resolve, we use a professional collection agency.'

But Osborn said: 'The problem is I was never notified [that the cheque had bounced]. Because they never contacted me, I never had the chance to set this straight.'

AAA Collectors Inc., sued Osborn for $739.85, which included $450 in legal fees. The firm declined to comment.

He also had to pay $100 to file a legal response just to stop the agency from winning a judgment by default.

He says it was the 'cost that got [him] really upset'.

He was asked if he wanted to settle but declined and will appear in court on May 8.

However, he says the ordeal has not dampened regard for the Girl Scouts and saw his daughter join a different troop earlier this year.

'I like the Girl scouts and their Girl Scout cookies,' he said. 'I have no problem donating the money to them. This is making me think twice about writing a cheque. Just cash -- lesson learned.'
