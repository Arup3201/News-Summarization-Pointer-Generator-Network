A depressed graduate has told of his relief after he twice failed to commit suicide in front of a horrified crowd in China.

Awang Yao, 21, climbed on top of a high voltage line alongside a railway track after his family ordered him to get a job - but the pole he climbed was not connected to the live wire.

He then decided to jump in front of a passing train, but landed on its roof and tumbled to the ground, injured but alive.

Failed bid: Awang Yao, 21, climbed on top of a high voltage line after his family told him to get a job - but the pole was not connected to the live wire

Second attempt: The 21-year-old then decided to jump in front of a train, but mistimed the jump and landed on its roof before tumbling to the ground

Mr Awang, who was taken to hospital and later released, has since told local media his actions were 'foolish' and said he was 'glad it didn't work'.

He has reconciled with his parents and promised to start looking for a job.

Local officials were criticised for 
not stopping the trains but said that there had been so many fake 
suicides that they did not take all of them seriously, and that any 
stoppage would have created a major problem.

A crowd gathered along the track after Mr Awang was spotted climbing the pole in Changsha, Hunan Province.

He said: 'I had been home for some weeks after graduating and 
my father kept going on at me about getting work, so I decided to move 
in with my uncle as he rarely nagged me. But after a few weeks he told 
me to get a job as well. It was too much, so I decided to end it all.

'I am glad that it didnâ€™t work, it was foolish, and now I plan to try hard to find work.'

Shock: A crowd of onlookers gathered at the scene of the suicide attempt in Changsha, Hunan Province

Recovery: The man was patched up by ambulance workers and has now vowed to find work
