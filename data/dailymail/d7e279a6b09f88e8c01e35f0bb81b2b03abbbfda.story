The father arrested at a school board meeting after complaining about a sexually explicit novel on his daughter’s reading list said that his family was ‘violated’, describing the book as 'graphic and violent' and featuring a scene that was 'arguably an instance of date rape'.

William Baer lost his temper during the meeting between parents and school officials from New Hampshire's Gilford High School.

The meeting was convened to give parents the chance to discuss the appropriateness of ninth-grade students being given Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes - a novel about a school shooting that contains themes of bullying and sexual violence.

Willaim Baer is led out of the school board meeting by a police officer on Monday after he complained about his 14-year-old daughter being given a sexually-explicit book as an English assignment

Mr Baer, an attorney, raised his voice at the meeting and said that he didn't believe that the school showed his daughter respect by giving her a book with sexually-explicit themes

Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult deals with a school shooting and has themes of bullying and sexual content

A two-minute time limit for speaking 
was imposed on those attending the meeting and when Mr Baer exceeded 
this, during a strident outburst, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.

Immediately after his arrest his 
daughter, Marina, 14, railed against the school authorities. She told 
them: ‘This just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of 
conflict. And I'm appalled. I don't trust you and I honestly don't feel 
safe around you people.’

Footage of the drama was quickly uploaded to the internet.

Speaking to Fox News after his
 arrest, Mr Baer said: ‘The problem is that there was no notice from the
 school that this would be the assigned reading.

'I'm 50 and I'm not prude and I've 
never read anything like that in my life. It is graphic. It is violent, 
it is arguably an instance of date rape. I feel like my family has been 
violated.'

The book contains a description of 
rough sex between two teenagers including the words: 'She could feel his
 erection, hot against her stomach'.

Mr Baer expressed his outrage that his
 daughter had been assigned the reading material and when he asked to 
read the concerning passage aloud, the school board refused.

'Sir, would you please be respectful of the other people?' a school board member asked.

He replied: 'Like you’re respectful of my daughter, right? And my children?'

Mr Baer, an attorney, was seen on 
camera arguing heatedly with school authorities and a parent who 
supported the book for several minutes before a police officer 
approached him in the audience.

The officer appeared to ask Mr Baer to
 leave. He responded: 'Because I violated the two-minute rule?', 
referring to his allotted speaking time at the meeting.

'I guess you're going to have to 
arrest me,' Mr Baer told the police officer, who then ordered him to 
stand up and led him by the arm out of the library meeting.

The father was then placed in handcuffs and charged with disorderly conduct.

Mr Baer told EAGNews: 'I was shocked when I read the passage, and not much shocks me anymore.

'My wife was stunned by the increasingly graphic nature of the sexual content of the scene and the imagery it evoked.'

The lines which caused parents' concern in the class-assigned text:

'Relax,’ Matt murmured, and then he sank his teeth into her shoulder.
 He pinned her hands over her head and ground his hips against hers. She could feel his erection, hot against her stomach. She
 couldn’t remember ever feeling so heavy, as if her heart were 
beating between her legs. She clawed at Matt’s back to bring him closer.
 'Yeah,' he groaned, and he pushed her thighs apart. And then suddenly
 Matt was inside her, pumping so hard that she scooted backward on the 
carpet, burning the backs of her legs.
 He clamped his hand over her mouth and drove harder and harder until 
Josie felt him come.Semen, sticky and hot, pooled on the carpet beneath 
her.

Another parent Doug Lambert told WCVB:
 'You are also cheating the kids out of being exposed to real literature
 in front of them. This is garbage.'

Jodi Picoult also weighed in on the debate over her book.

She wrote: 'Another parent is 
challenging #19Minutes bc it contains a sex scene far more vague than 
anything on TV. Sad to focus on that & not bullying.'

Nineteen Minutes was published in 2007 and debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.

Picoult's fans jumped to her defense over criticism of the novel.

Jolene wernig wrote:'@jodipicoult My 2 girls went to #GHS and LOVE your books! Re-reading 19minutes this week.'

Holly Soave tweeted to the writer: 
'@jodipicoult as a teen, #19minutes changed my life & the way I 
think about bullying & how actions affect everyone around us. I'm 
grateful.'

The school board apologized 'for the 
failure of the school district to send home prior notice of assignment 
of the novel' but added that it had been part of the school curriculum 
since 2007 and there had been no complaints.

Superintendent Kent Hemingway told WND
 that the book was 'thematically important' because it allowed students 
to explore issues surrounding a fictional school shooting.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Mr Hemingway.

The school's mission statements 
include the belief that 'learning occurs best in disciplined, safe, and 
respectful environments where community members are valued and expected 
to play their roles in education and be accountable for their actions'.

Mr Baer said the charges against him had not been dropped.
