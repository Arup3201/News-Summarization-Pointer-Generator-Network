A mother has been listed in critical condition after her husband allegedly beat her with a baseball bat when he learned she was planning to leave him.

Diane DeMaio may have suffered brain injuries as a result of the attack early Tuesday evening.

When police arrived at her home, they found her lying in a pool of blood with her eyes open, saying 'What, hello, what's going on' before closing them.

Domestic: Diane DeMaio is in critical condition after he husband Michael allegedly beat her with a baseball bat

Her husband Michael, 55, was arrested when police arrived at the couple's Connecticut mansion and spoke to the victim's mother, Gloria Sica, who said: 'That monster hit her and she's dying'.

The Connecticut Post reports that the responding officer tried to put pressure on Mrs DeMaio's large cut on her head 'but felt it was soft'.

Michael DeMaio has been charged with attempted murder and first degree assault, and now remains under police custody with a $1million bond.

The assault reportedly started when his wife, who is a nutritionist and runs her own business, told him that she would be leaving him.

'I just lost it, I just lost it,' he told responding officers, according to The Connecticut Post.

Mansion: The attack took place on the second floor in the couple's mansion located on one of Greenwich's most prestigious roads

Horrific: The victim's mother was in their home when the attack took place and she told police 'That monster hit her and she's dying!'

Mrs Sica was screaming from the second floor when the police arrived, yelling 'help me, my daughter is dying'.  

The victim, her husband and her mother appear to be the only two people in the 8,326-square-foot mansion.

The couple have three children who are grown and no longer live in the 6-bedroom home.

They bought the house for $2.6million in 1995 and the value of the house has appreciated to nearly $7.3million in the last 18 years.The home is listed in Mrs DeMaio's name.

The couple originally put the house on the market for $7.78million in July but have decreased the sticker price three times since.  

Charged: DeMaio, who has no criminal record, faces attempted murder and assault charges and is being held

Motive: The attack was supposedly caused by Mrs DeMaio told her husband that she was leaving him

One of the largest homes on Greenwich's prestigious Round Hill Road, the DeMaio's house sits on 3.6 acres and features a tennis court, pool, marble fireplaces and eight car garage.

On her website, Mrs DeMaio tells that she is board certified nutrition specialist and coach of First Line therapy.

She is now in Stamford Hospital and is recovering from emergency surgery.

Her husband may post bond, and if he does he will be tracked with a GPS monitoring bracelet until his next scheduled court appearance on September 18.

His charges could be increased to murder if her condition worsens and she dies.

'I mean this is the craziest thing. I would have never expected this especially in this neighborhood.  People usually keep to themselves and they're usually good people,' neighbor Jack Varvel told local station WTNH.

Caution: Mrs DeMaio had to undergo emergency surgery at Stamford Hospital where she remains in critical condition
