Four hackers who believed they were 'latter day pirates' caused tens of millions of pounds worth of damage in cyber attacks on the CIA, the Pentagon, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and even the NHS.

The members of notorious hacker group Lulzsec hijacked computers to attack major businesses including Sony, the Pentagon and newspaper publisher News International in an attack in February 2011.

The attacks led to sensitive personal information being leaked online, leaving victims open to fraud. They even attacked the US X Factor contestant data base.

The group who caused IT chaos at huge organisations include an A-level student in Peckham, south London, and a 20-year old working from his bedroom in the remote Shetland Islands.

The gang wreaked havoc by using 'zombie' computers known as a 'botnet' to launch 'distributed denial of service' attacks.

They work by overwhelming servers with useless data and flooding computers with traffic so they crash. The court was told this 'is the internet version of causing a traffic jam' and is used to disable websites.

Other high-profile victims who have fallen prey to the shady online outfit included film studios 20th Century Fox, the Arizona State Police and the NHS.

Once inside the sites they made unauthorised modifications, including adjustments to security settings, control of access to and distribution of confidential data, and re-directing visitors to websites hosted by hackers.

Ryan Cleary, 21, Jake Davis, 20, Ryan Ackroyd, 26, Mustafa Al-Bassam, 18, all appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today having earlier pleaded guilty to various hacking offences.

The court heard how Davis, Ackroyd and Al-Bassam were 'core members' of the international hacking group along with a fourth man known as 'Sabu' convicted in America.

They cost companies and state agencies tens of millions of pounds by attacking their websites.

Sandip Patel, prosecuting, said: 'The defendants are colloquially known as cyber attackers based in the UK and elsewhere and they waged what was an undoubtedly sophisticated and orchestrated campaign between February and September 2011.

'They achieved extensive national and international notoriety and publicity. They caused unprecedented harm to their victims.

'They saw themselves as latterday pirates. They identified vulnerable computer systems, when they found them they would break into them and pillage them.

'Whatever their motivation, their criminal actions were premeditated, deliberate and extensive. They are at the cutting edge of the contemporary species of international criminal offending referred to as cyber crime.'

The name Lulzsec is a combination of 
'lulz' or 'lols', meaning 'laugh out loud' and security, and was a 
direct descent of notorious hacking group Anonymous.

The group researched and targeted vulnerable websites and Cleary provided a sophisticated botnet server which was able to power their denial of service attacks.

Jake Davis, nicknamed 'Topiary', was the brains behind the group's communications strategy which he ran from his bedroom in the Shetlands. He ran their website, LulzSec Security, and Twitter feed where he boasted about the attacks the gang had waged and said 'we are Gods now'.

The court heard how Cleary, nicknamed 'Viral' was not a core member of Lulzsec but pined to be accepted by the group. He let them use his botnet - a 'web robot' that he had spent six years building and which powered the denial of service attacks.

Mr Patel said: 'At any one time he had up to 100,000 computers directly and actively under his control.'

Cleary, from Wickford, Essex, was 'trigger happy' and pocketed up to Â£3,000 a month by letting other people use his botnet, the court heard. Among its victims was the US Pentagon which had to fork out $120,000 to repair its computer system.

Ryan Ackroyd, 26, from Doncaster, masqueraded online as a 16-year-old girl called Kayla and was 'probably the most sophisticated known conspirator', the court heard.

He was responsible for researching sites to target and was known as a 'highly sophisticated rooter'.

A-level student Al Bassam, of Peckham, southeast London, known as 'T-flow' was a technical mastermind who sought out vulnerable wesbites the gang could target.

In one attack he published data from Sony which cost the company an estimated $20m.

While in another attack in May 2011 the gang hacked US network Fox and uploaded the personal details of 74,000 people who had registered to appear on X-Factor.

Al Bassam previously admitted two counts of conspiring to do an unauthorised act with intent, or reckless as to, impairing the operation of computer.

He also pleaded guilty to a longer-running hacking campaign that saw data stolen from the systems of organisations including 20th Century Fox, Nintendo, the NHS, and the Arizona State Police.

Fellow conspirators Ryan Ackroyd, 26, from Doncaster, and Jake Davis, 20, and Ryan Cleary, 21 have pleaded guilty to taking part in cyber attacks.

Davis and Cleary had both earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to do an unauthorised act or acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing, the operation of a computer or computers.

Ackroyd admitted hacking into a series of organisations' computer systems between February 1, 2011, and September 2 the same year.

In a separate case, Cleary had earlier pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children and possessing indecent images of children.

The sentencing continues.
