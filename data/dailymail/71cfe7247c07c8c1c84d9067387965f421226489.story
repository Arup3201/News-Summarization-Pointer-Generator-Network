Biomarkers in the blood can be used to identify people at risk of suicide, a study suggests.

U.S. research raises the controversial prospect of a blood test providing early warning of suicide attempts.

Scientists said their results were 'proof of principle' for a suicide test, while British experts reacted with scepticism.

U.S. experts hope a simple blood test could help detect and treat those at a higher risk of committing suicide. However British scientist are treating the findings cautiously, saying it is one thing to find a biomarker but quite another to use it as a predictor of future behaviour

One particular molecule, an enzyme called SAT1, was linked to suicidal tendencies in a group of patients with bipolar disorder, a mental illness characterised by episodes of extreme high and low moods.

Three other markers showed a weaker association.The elevated blood markers stood out in a subgroup of nine patients who displayed a sudden dramatic shift to powerful suicidal thoughts.

A similar pattern was seen in blood samples taken from nine suicide victims who had succeeded in killing themselves.

Finally blood samples were tested from two further groups of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia-type pychoses.

It is hoped that a test could be developed that would flag up those who will not admit they are severely depressed

Raised levels of the biomarkers correlated with admissions to hospital after suicide attempts. The link was stronger for bipolar disorder than for schizophrenia.

Study leader Dr Alexander Niculescu, from Indiana University, said: 'Suicide is a big problem in psychiatry. It's a big problem in the civilian realm, it's a big problem in the military realm and there are no objective markers.

'There are people who will not reveal they are having suicidal thoughts when you ask them, who then commit it and there's nothing you can do about it. We need better ways to identify, intervene and prevent these tragic cases.

'These seem to be good markers for suicidal behaviour in males who have bipolar mood disorders or males in the general population who commit impulsive violent suicide. In the future we want to study and assemble clinical and socio-demographic risk factors, along with our blood tests, to increase our ability to predict risk.'

He acknowledged one limitation of the research, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, was that the participants were all male.Â 

'There could be gender differences,' he said. 'We would also like to conduct more extensive, normative studies in the population at large.'

He plans to conduct further research focusing on more deliberate and planned suicides.

In their paper, the scientists point to a link between SAT1 and polyamine, a chemical involved in apoptosis, or 'cell suicide' - the programmed self destruction of damaged or harmful cells.

British scientists said the research should be treated with caution.

Professor Matthew Hotopf, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, stressed the need to have the results replicated by other studies.

He added: 'It's one thing to find a biomarker which might be associated at a statistical level with suicidal behaviour. It's quite another to use it to make any kind of prediction which has clinical utility.

'These findings may attract media attention, but they are very much preliminary and my money would be on failed replication and even if replication was successful, lack of predictive power to be a useful clinical tool.'
