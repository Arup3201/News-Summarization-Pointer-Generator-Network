Tragic: Hilda Fairweather, who froze to death in the grounds of the care home were she lived after staff failed to notice she gone missing or carry out checks

A 91-year-old woman with dementia froze to death in the grounds of the care home where she lived after being 'completely overlooked' by staff, a court heard.

Hilda Fairweather was not reported missing from the Abele View home in Iverley, near Stourbridge, West Midlands, until the morning after she wandered outside through a fire door.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that only two staff were looking after 29 residents on the freezing January night in 2009 when Mrs Fairweather died of hypothermia.

Although the fire door was found ajar shortly after Mrs Fairweather disappeared, the court heard a head count - which would have taken seven minutes - was not carried out.

Checks on her scheduled for during the night were not done and staff didn't even realise they'd failed to put her to bed.

The company that owns the home, Abele View Ltd, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to failing to ensure the safety of its residents and making an insufficient risk assessment.

Today it was fined £133,000 and ordered to pay £122,412 in costs.

Prosecutor Bernard Thorogood said the safety breaches at the isolated home were committed despite numerous previous incidents in which confused residents had wandered off.

On one previous occasion an elderly man had left the building barefoot and plunged into a ditch, the court heard.

Mrs Fairweather, originally from Kidderminster, was last seen by staff at 7.30pm on January 29, 2009, and was found dead at 7.45am the following morning.

Mr Thorogood told the court: 'In the intervening time she should have been put to bed, and she should have been checked for other purposes through the night.'

Records which should have shown the scheduled checks were missing, said Mr Thorogood, who outlined 18 instances of 'accepted criminality' on behalf of Abele View.

As well as accepting that its failures caused Mrs Fairweather’s death, Abele View also acknowledges it had inadequate staffing levels, and that risks were created by poor supervision and management.

Previous incidents in which residents were allowed to wander off represented a series of wake-up calls for the home and its management, Mr Thorogood said.

utlining how Mrs Fairweather’s absence went unnoticed, Mr Thorogood told the court: 'The sad and deeply unattractive facts are that she had frozen to death outside the home on a freezing night in January when she should not have been able to get out.

'For a variety of reasons she should have had substantial contact with the staff through the night.'

The lawyer, prosecuting on behalf of South Staffordshire District Council, added: 'The fault here that is accepted is a corporate fault.

'We submit it goes right to the top of this company. Any attempt to blame individual staff failings would not be right - this came from the top.'
