Trial: Prolific burglar Carl Anderson, 50, who has been jailed for 12 years at Birmingham Crown Court

A prolific burglar who used his car as a weapon to slam a police officer into a lamppost in a desperate attempt to escape has been jailed for 12 years.

Carl Anderson, 50, reversed his car across a road at up to 35mph, engine screaming and tyres screeching, as Pc Peter McGinn clung to the driver’s side door trying to grab the keys.

Judge Melbourne Inman QC, sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, told Anderson: ‘You deliberately reversed the car at speed such that the open door was smashed against a lamppost with such force it broke the hinges and folded the door back against the car.

‘Between that door and the lamppost was Pc McGinn.’

Anderson, who had previously admitted grievous bodily harm with intent to wound, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and burglary also pleaded guilty to driving while being disqualified as he was banned from the wheel at the time of the offence.

His victim Pc McGinn, who attended court, was left with a shattered left leg, under-going lengthy surgery to pin and repair his broken bones following the smash.

He has been left in constant agony and needed crutches to get to today’s hearing.

Robert Price, prosecuting, said the incident happened after Anderson had been spotted in the back garden of a house in Erdington in the city on the afternoon of Friday, June 7, breaking in to a shed.

The police were called and officers in a marked police car spotted Anderson getting in a car in nearby Compton Road a short while after.

He said: ‘Pc McGinn immediately jumped out of the police car, and opened the driver’s door shouting to Mr Anderson: ‘police, get out now’.’

However, Anderson responded by turning the keys in the ignition, despite a struggle from Pc McGinn, and stamped ‘heavily on the accelerator’.

Witnesses, including other officers who had arrived on the scene, described the car’s engine ‘screaming’ and its tyres ‘screeching’ as it ‘arced across the road towards a lamppost’ said Mr Price.

As the Honda Stream shot across the road towards the lamppost, 44-year-old Pc McGinn clung with one hand to Anderson’s shoulder, desperately trying to run in time with the car’s motion ‘while struggling to stop the vehicle’.

He described Anderson looking ‘steely and determined’ as he accelerated.

However, despite the officer’s efforts the car slammed into the post with such force another policeman watching the unfolding incident believed his colleague had been killed.

Pc McGinn’s left leg took the brunt of the impact and was crushed - a moment he described as causing ‘immediate and excruciating pain’ according to Mr Price.

As he lay injured, Anderson drove off up the street, forcing another police officer to jump aside, then dodged a riot van which attempted to ram his car in order to stop his escape.

In nearby Minstead Road, another patrol car had to swerve away ‘to avoid a head-on collision’ Mr Price said.

Anderson later abandoned his damaged car and got away on foot, but was later traced from evidence left at the scene to his home and arrested.

He refused to co-operate with police or be formally interviewed following detention.

Mr Price said Anderson had ‘used his car as a weapon’ and ‘deliberately targeted his victim’.

In mitigation, Sharon Bailey said her client had gone out to steal that day because ‘he needed money because his gas and electric had run out’.

Although her client had a ‘lengthy record of offending’ he had never previously committed a crime of this nature she said, and when confronted with what had happened that day he simply ‘panicked’.

Ms Bailey said, at the time, Anderson was voluntarily co-operating with the police’s offender management team, which works with prolific offenders at high risk of re-offending to try to keep them out of trouble.

‘He had agreed to be tagged and had been provided with a mobile phone to be able to keep in touch.

‘He had also been driven around by police, so he could point out where he had carried out offences which pre-dated this incident,’ she said.

As Ms Bailey presented her mitigation, Anderson sat in the dock wearing a grey shirt and dabbed tears from his eyes with tissue.

Pc McGinn, in an impact statement read to the court, said his life had been shattered by the incident.

The crash has placed a heavy burden on his wife, who works full-time and also helps care for their disabled daughter, and he is unable to wash or dress unaided.

Pc McGinn said the long-term impact on his health could not be predicted but he had suffered nerve and tendon damage, and had only 50% movement in his left knee, with further surgery likely.

He has been taking blood-thinning medication to clear potentially life-threatening clots from forming while there is an increased risk of arthritis developing.

Despite this, the officer said it was his wish to return to the force ‘which he loves’ and where he has served 11 years.

Even with treatment and physiotherapy, he said recovery could take up to two years.

Judge Inman, passing sentence, told Anderson: ‘The reality, of course, is that the genesis of all of that happened on that day was because you were out doing what you do - burgling people.

‘It is plain you used your vehicle as a weapon, quite deliberately, and caused very serious injury.

‘You were driving while banned, having previously been convicted of driving dangerously before, and in addition there is the aggravating factor of Pc McGinn’s injuries.’

He sentenced Anderson to 12 years in jail for GBH, and further imposed concurrent sentences of two years for burglary, 18 months for dangerous driving and four months for driving while disqualified.

Anderson was also banned from driving for a further nine years, while there was no separate penalty for driving without insurance.

The judge took 12 other offences - nine of house burglary and three shed burglaries - into consideration.
