A high-flying banker has claimed she was bullied, tormented and called ‘crazy Miss Cokehead’ by male colleagues after she blew the whistle on insider dealing.

Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova, who earned more than £750,000 a year,  is suing her firm over what she called a ‘sustained and vicious’ campaign of abuse and sexual harassment.

Colleagues at the investment bank allegedly referred to her as ‘mad Svetlana’ and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to ‘calm her down’.

Miss Lokhova, 32, said the harassment was part of a smear offensive as punishment for reporting insider dealing by a senior trader, who was later dismissed.

On the day she resigned, one male colleague said she needed to relax and should visit Nigeria ‘to be s****** by one or more big black men because they would calm her down’.

Senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin wrote in an email to a co-worker of how he ‘knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria . . . proper alpha male . . . she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months. These guys would help’.

Her barrister, Andrew Stafford QC, said the comments showed a ‘demeaning and offensive attitude towards women in general and to Miss Lokhova in particular’. The Russian-born daughter of a ship broker first quit her job as head of fixed income sales in February 2010 after being told by bosses that her complaint of insider trading was ‘unacceptable’.

However, two months later she was head-hunted by company bosses in Moscow and returned to the bank’s London-based subsidiary, Troika Dialog UK, with a guaranteed annual bonus of £666,000 on top of her £120,000 salary.

Miss Lokhova, who began working at the bank in 2008, claims that on her return line manager David Longmuir and chief executive officer Paolo Zaniboni victimised her because of the whistleblowing and conspired to get rid of her.

Six months later, her name was on a ‘firing list’ for poor performance and she started a grievance process against the bank. She was signed off sick with stress before finally resigning in April last year.

In a witness statement, Miss Lokhova, who was the only woman in her team, said she was referred to in emails by derogatory names, including ‘crazy’,  ‘mental’ and ‘totally unstable’. Others included ‘quite likely clinically bonkers’ and ‘MAJOR car crash’.

She said: ‘My job was made impossible. This persistent unlawful treatment has had a seriously detrimental effect on my health, with severe and long-term consequences.’

She was also described as a cocaine user, which Mr Longmuir now accepts was both untrue and defamatory.

Mr Stafford added: ‘This showed a willingness and intent to damage, by unlawful means, Miss Lokhova’s personal reputation and professional standing.’

The Central London Employment Tribunal was also told that prior to her first resignation, she had generated more than £20million in profit for the bank and was awarded a £600,000 cash bonus – the highest bonus paid globally to a sales person that year.

Miss Lokhova also claims that whilst she was signed off work with stress, Mr Zaniboni ‘mobilised a very intrusive level of security investigation’ into her private life.

She alleged that she was followed in the street near her home in Canary Wharf, east London, and had her conversations eavesdropped on.

When another Russian banker was gunned down outside his home at around the same time, Miss Lokhova became so fearful that she went to the police.

Naomi Ellenbogen QC, defending, insisted Miss Lokhova was not victimised because she was a whistleblower and said her client denied that Miss Lokhova ‘sustained any detriment’.

Instead, she argued, Miss Lokhova’s ‘rude and dismissive attitude towards colleagues, her unprofessional behaviour and her tendency to lose her temper and self-control when things did not go her way’ were to blame.

Spokesman Paul Marriott said Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender and owner of Troika Dialog UK, is ‘confident that it has acted appropriately and lawfully and will vigorously defend itself against the allegations made’.

Damages awarded by the tribunal are normally capped at £70,000 but are unlimited in discrimination and whistleblower claims.

The hearing continues.
