Banned: Maria Adams, 20, received a two-year driving ban for recklessly towing a friend in a Tesco wheelchair around a car park

A motorist has been banned after she was caught on camera in a car park dragging around a man in a wheelchair in a 'stupid' stunt.

CCTV captured driver Maria Adams, 20, recklessly towing a friend in a borrowed Tesco wheelchair around a car park at one of the supermarket's stores in Sunderland on January 10.

Her irresponsible male companion can be seen clinging to a towel attached to the back of Adams's black Nissan as she hurtles up and down the car park, dragging him back and forth behind her. 

The footage, which was played at Newcastle Crown Court, shows stunned shoppers loading bags into their cars as the call-centre worker and her friend shoot up and down the central lanes.

Several other vehicles also enter and exit the car park - forcing the pranksters to temporarily put their dangerous game on hold. 

Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She was towing a wheelchair, with a male sitting in it, around the car park.

'The wheelchair was one of Tesco's, for use by customers. There was a piece of towel attached to the car, held by the man in the wheelchair as he was pulled along. 

'The incident went on for about three or four minutes. 

'Security guards feared for the safety of customers who were still frequenting the store and feared for the safety of the man in the wheelchair.

'He did not require a wheelchair, you see him get out and walk away unaided.'

Adams, of Whitburn, Sunderland, admitted dangerous driving and was sentenced to a community order for 12 months with a four month night time curfew.

She was also handed a £1,369 costs bill and a two year driving ban.

Judge Penny Moreland told her: 'I have seen the CCTV footage of you driving a car in Tesco car park, towing around someone using a Tesco wheelchair.

'It is accurately categorised as a piece of stupidity. Risk was present to others using the car park.'

Graeme Cook, defending, said Adams had never been in trouble before the incident and appreciates what she did was dangerous.

Mr Cook added: 'It was an act of stupidity really, that is what it boils down to.'
