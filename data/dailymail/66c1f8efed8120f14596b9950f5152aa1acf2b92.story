Samuel Johnson is not a hipster and never will be.

Not because the actor thinks the 'metrosexual subculture' is ridiculous or just a passing trend. But because he cannot grow a beard.

'I am definitely not a hipster,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I nearly drowned in beard envy... there was a lot of envy. 

'I did try and grow a beard for the show and it was so bad the producers said "nope get rid of it".' 

Samuel Johnson returns to our screens after a three-year hiatus when he unicycled around Australia 

Now he's starring the SBS 2 documentary Hipsters, exploring the subculture and its characteristics 

The show the former Secret Life of Us actor is referring to is Hipsters, an SBS2 documentary about the fashionable inner city trend that has swept cities across the world.

From Sydney and Melbourne to Shanghai, LA, New York and London to Berlin and Tokyo, men have adopted a unique style - complete with skinny jeans and well-groomed facial hair - and advocated the use of ethically-sourced coffee, creating what Johnson refers to as a subculture, similar to the punks and mods of decades past.

'We were looking at beards, skinny jeans and ethically sourced coffee... as well as triangle tattoos and all the other things that go with it,' Johnson said. 

'We’re not proud of it (being a hipster) now, people don’t want to be labelled.

'Punks were proud to be punks and mods were proud to be mods. 

He spent time travelling around Australia on a unicycle raising money for cancer in honour of his sister Connie

'I learned that it’s very difficult for a subculture to thrive in a digital age where information is at everyone fingertips

'We’re in a digital age now so where are our subcultures meant to thrive?

'(They're) Instagrammed and thrust into the corners of the corporate world before they know who they are.'

Johnson has been absent from Australian TV screens for the past three years, spending most of that time raising money for his cancer-stricken sister Connie by riding a unicycle 15,000km around the country, entering the Guinness Book of World Records in the process.

But he is back with a vengeance, making the SBS doco and starring in a biopic on music icon Molly Meldrum.

He and Connie have some new plans in the works for another stunt for Love Your Sister

'Yeah I was out for about three years with the unifying madness that was Love Your Sister,' Johnson said, adding he has also written a Love Your Sister book.

'To get back and land Hipsters and Molly was almost too good to be true.

'I’m not sure which job is more difficult understanding hipsters or understanding Molly Meldrum.'

He described recent years as a 'wild ride' and said 'by day I was doing Hipsters and by night I was writing the Love Your Sister book and studying Molly'.

He revealed his sister Connie, who has battled cancer since she was 11, is doing well, and when asked what was next for the brother-sister duo, he said there were exciting things ahead.

'We’re cooking up some great ideas at the moment.

'Connie’s come up with a corker that I think is even better that the uni-cycling.'

Samuel Johnson goes behind the beard in Hipsters on SBS 2 which premieres Tuesday, March 24 at 8.30pm.
