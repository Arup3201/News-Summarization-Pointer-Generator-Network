Unsuspecting: Customers had no idea they were using rigged cash machines

A Romanian deported from Britain seven years ago was today jailed for four months after returning to London to steal money from cash machines.

Claudiu Ojogel, 31, was kicked out of the UK in 2005 after he was found to be using a false Moldovan identity.

But he returned to England, where a group of fellow Romanians told him about the cash machine scam - describing it as 'an easy way of making money'.

Ojogel was spotted acting suspiciously while using a Halifax ATM in Moorgate, London.

He was searched and found to be carrying the 'cash trap' device and £340 in cash.

Prosecutor Timothy Devlin told the Old Bailey: 'It is a small metal item which you insert into the cash machine.

'The
money comes out of the machine into the cash trap and cannot either be 
brought out by the customer or taken back by the machine.

'The 
fraudsters wait for customers to try and take money and then come back 
to make a small transaction and reach inside to remove the cash.'

Ojogel pleaded guilty to possession of an article for use in fraud at City Of London Magistrates' Court earlier this month.

The Old Bailey heard he served a nine month prison sentence in 2005 after being convicted of possession of false identification at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court.

His barrister Gurish Thanki said: 'He returned to Romania and since then he has been unemployed.

'He came to the UK under his real name and a group of Romanians told him this was an easy way of making money.'

Mr Devlin said the prosecution did not known his true identity or his immigration status.

Judge Nicholas Cooke QC sentenced Ojogel to four months imprisonment and ordered him to pay £340 costs.

He added: ‘Your presence in this country is a matter for the authorities.’

A new deportation notice has been served on Ojogel. Ojogel, of no fixed address, has already served 32 days in custody.
