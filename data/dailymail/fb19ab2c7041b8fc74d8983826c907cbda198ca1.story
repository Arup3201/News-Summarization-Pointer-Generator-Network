A prankster had monster-ous fun ahead of the opening of blockbuster Godzilla, by programming a road sign to warn drivers that the creature was attacking San Francisco.

The electronic sign was set up last week to flag potential delays caused by a fun run, but instead the ominous messages ‘Godzilla Attack’ and ‘Turn Back’ were displayed.

The joke messages appeared just before Godzilla stomped all over the competition by taking top spot at the box office at the weekend, raking in $93.2million.

Do the signs point to a PR stunt? Photographs of the messages were taken by San Franciscan Ali Wunderman, who thought they might be the work of guerrilla marketeers

Photographs of the joke Godzilla messages on Van Ness Avenue were taken by resident Ali Wunderman  – and she thinks it
 may have been a PR stunt.

‘I thought it was guerrilla marketing for the new Godzilla movie,’ she told SFGate.

The prank was particularly apt for San Francisco, as it’s the scene of an almighty monster battle in the movie.

The U.S. Air Force’s largest combat wing based at Kadena Air Force Base in Japan is ready to see off Godzilla, according to a set of interviews conducted by the Smithsonian Air & Space Magazine.

Senior Airman Mark Herman says that 
the best angle of attack would best come from above using the Air 
Force's AH-64 Apache helicopters and F-15 fighter jets.

'We
 can deploy a team quickly and use the guns on board to provide some 
much needed fire power. We would probably need to use all the F-15 
fighter jets we have here along with the rapidly deployable Cobra 
helicopter gunship aircraft,' SnR Herman confidently says.

'Using our 50mm guns, four kilos of ammo with eight guns and 600 rounds a piece, it's got to do something, right?'

Master Sergeant Jason Edwards says Kadena base is the keystone of the Pacific because of their strategic location.

'Should
 Godzilla come to Japan, we are prepared,' he insists. However, Msgt 
Edwards takes a more realistic view over the military's defense 
capabilities.

'I would think
 that Godzilla would be expecting an aerial attack so to catch him 
off-guard I think we would need 4,000 segways and slingshots!'

The
 sign is provided by Pacific Highway Rentals and its boss, Paul 
Indelicato, believes it was hacked by someone who knew the combination 
code to its lock.

He said: 
‘We’re guessing it’s someone who knew the combination and put the 
message up there. It only takes a minute to change the message. Someone 
was having fun.’

The 
creature feature had the second-largest opening weekend so far this 
year, only behind Captain America: The Winter Solider, which opened 
with $95million in April.

The
 dark Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures' sci-fi monster reboot, starring 
Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, trumped last weekend's No. 1 
hit, Universal Pictures' Neighbors, which was pushed down to No. 2 in 
its second weekend.

The raunchy comedy earned $26million, bringing its domestic total to a solid $91.5million.

Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that a Godzilla sequel is 'in the works.'

'We
 have a franchise in the making, and we're looking at sequels as we 
speak,' Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, 
told Reuters.

Fifty-eight per cent of Godzilla viewers this weekend were male and 40 percent were under 40 years old, the Reporter said.

Rounding
 out the top three is The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with $16.8million. So 
far it's earned a total of $172million domestically.

Also opening this weekend, Disney's feel-good sports drama Million Dollar Arm, starring Jon Hamm, gained $11million.
