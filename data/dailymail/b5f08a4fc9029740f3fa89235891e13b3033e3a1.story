From the dingy donut shops of
Manhattan to the cloistered police watering holes in Brooklyn, a
number of black NYPD officers say they have experienced the same
racial profiling that cost Eric Garner his life.

Garner, a 43-year-old black man suspected of illegally
peddling loose cigarettes, died in July after a white officer
put him in a chokehold.

His death, and that of an unarmed black
teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked a slew of nationwide
protests against police tactics.

On Saturday, those tensions
escalated after a black gunman, who wrote of avenging the black
deaths on social media, shot dead two New York policemen.

Retired detective Harold Thomas, a 30-year veteran of the NYPD, says he fell victim to racial profiling when he was off duty and insists: 'If I was white, it wouldn't have happened'

The protests and the ambush of the uniformed officers pose a
major challenge for New York Mayor Bill De Blasio. The
mayor must try to ease damaged relations with a police force
that feels he hasn't fully supported them, while at the same
time bridging a chasm with communities who say the police
unfairly target them.

What's emerging now is that, within the thin blue line of
the NYPD, there is another divide — between black and white
officers.

Reuters interviewed 25 African American male officers on the
NYPD, 15 of whom are retired and 10 of whom are still serving.
All but one said that, when off duty and out of uniform, they
had been victims of racial profiling, which refers to using race
or ethnicity as grounds for suspecting someone of having
committed a crime.

The officers said this included being pulled over for no
reason, having their heads slammed against their cars, getting
guns brandished in their faces, being thrown into prison vans
and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping. The majority of
the officers said they had been pulled over multiple times while
driving. Five had had guns pulled on them.

Desmond Blaize, who retired two years ago as a sergeant in
the 41st Precinct in the Bronx, said he once got stopped
while taking a jog through Brooklyn's upmarket Prospect Park. 'I
had my ID on me so it didn't escalate,' said Blaize, who has
sued the department alleging he was racially harassed on the
job. 'But what's suspicious about a jogger? In jogging clothes?'

The NYPD and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the
police officers' union, declined requests for comment. However,
defenders of the NYPD credit its policing methods with
transforming New York from the former murder capital of the
world into the safest big city in the United States.

'It makes good headlines to say this is occurring, but I
don't think you can validate it until you look into the
circumstances they were stopped in,' said Bernard Parks, the
former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, who is
African American.

'Now if you want to get into the essence of why certain
groups are stopped more than others, then you only need to go to
the crime reports and see which ethnic groups are listed more as
suspects. That's the crime data the officers are living with.'

Blacks made up 73 percent of the shooting perpetrators in
New York in 2011 and were 23 percent of the population.

A number of academics believe those statistics are
potentially skewed because police over-focus on black
communities, while ignoring crime in other areas. They also note
that being stopped as a suspect does not automatically equate to
criminality. Nearly 90 percent of blacks stopped by the NYPD,
for example, are found not to be engaged in any crime.

The black officers interviewed said they had been racially
profiled by white officers exclusively, and about one third said
they made some form of complaint to a supervisor.

All but one said their supervisors either dismissed the
complaints or retaliated against them by denying them overtime,
choice assignments, or promotions. The remaining officers who
made no complaints said they refrained from doing so either
because they feared retribution or because they saw racial
profiling as part of the system.

In declining to comment to Reuters, the NYPD did not respond
to a specific request for data showing the racial breakdown of
officers who made complaints and how such cases were handled.

White officers were not the only ones accused of wrongdoing.
Civilian complaints against police officers are in direct
proportion to their demographic makeup on the force, according
to the NYPD's Civilian Complaint Review Board.

Indeed, some of the officers Reuters interviewed
acknowledged that they themselves had been defendants in
lawsuits, with allegations ranging from making a false arrest to
use of excessive force. Such claims against police are not
uncommon in New York, say veterans.

Still, social psychologists from Stanford and Yale
universities and John Jay College of Criminal Justice have
conducted research - including the 2004 study 'Seeing Black:
Race, Crime and Visual Processing' - showing there is an
implicit racial bias in the American psyche that correlates
black maleness with crime.

John Jay professor Delores Jones-Brown cited a 2010 New York
State Task Force report on police-on-police shootings - the
first such inquiry of its kind - that found that in the previous
15 years, officers of color had suffered the highest fatalities
in encounters with police officers who mistook them for
criminals.

There's evidence that aggressive policing in the NYPD is
intensifying, according to data from the New York City
Comptroller.

Thomas, a former NYPD detective, is suing the city over an altercation with police that he says ended in his head being smashed against the hood of his car

Police misconduct claims - including lawsuits against police
for using the kind of excessive force that killed Garner - have
risen 214 percent since 2000, while the amount the city paid out
has risen 75 percent in the same period, to $64.4 million in
fiscal year 2012, the last year for which data is available.

People who have taken part in the marches against Garner's
death - and that of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown - say they
are protesting against the indignity of being stopped by police
for little or no reason as much as for the deaths themselves.

'There's no real outlet to report the abuse,' said Brooklyn
Borough President Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain who said he
was stigmatized and retaliated against throughout his 22-year
career for speaking out against racial profiling and police
brutality.

Officers make complaints to the NYPD's investigative arm,
the Internal Affairs Bureau, only to later have their identities
leaked, said Adams.

One of the better-known cases of alleged racial profiling of
a black policeman concerns Harold Thomas, a decorated detective
who retired this year after 30 years of service, including in
New York's elite Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Shortly before 1 a.m. one night in August 2012, Thomas was
leaving a birthday party at a trendy New York nightclub.

Wearing flashy jewelry, green sweatpants and a white
t-shirt, Thomas walked toward his brand-new white Escalade when
two white police officers approached him. What happened next is
in dispute, but an altercation ensued, culminating in Thomas
getting his head smashed against the hood of his car and then
spun to the ground and put in handcuffs.

'If I was white, it wouldn't have happened,' said Thomas,
who has filed a lawsuit against the city over the incident. The
New York City Corporation Counsel said it could not comment on
pending litigation.

At an ale house in Williamsburg, Brooklyn last week, a group
of black police officers from across the city gathered for the
beer and chicken wing special. They discussed how the officers
involved in the Garner incident could have tried harder to talk
down an upset Garner, or sprayed mace in his face, or forced him
to the ground without using a chokehold.

They all agreed his
death was avoidable.

Said one officer from the 106th Precinct in Queens, 'That
could have been any one of us.'
