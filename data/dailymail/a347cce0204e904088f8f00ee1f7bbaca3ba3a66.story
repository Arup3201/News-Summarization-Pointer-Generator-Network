Grumeti put himself in line for a £60,000 bonus if he can repeat Sunday's gritty Plumpton victory at this year's Cheltenham Festival.

Alan King's Grade One-winning hurdler had disappointed at Warwick when last seen, but he ran on gamely to see off Chris Pea Green by a length-and-a-quarter in the Follow AtTheRaces On Twitter Novices' Chase to leave connections eyeing a March windfall.

King said: 'The bonus will be considered and the question is which race we go for. He'll no doubt have an entry in the Arkle, but we will have all options covered. 

Grumeti (centre), ridden by jockey Wayne Hutchinson clears the last to win at Pumpton on Sunday 

'He jumped well but that wouldn't be his ground. I think he'll be a much better horse on better ground.' 

There was a major shock in the first Grade One ever staged at Naas when Tell Us More, as short as 5-1 in the ante-post market for the Neptune Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, was floored by stablemate and 33-1 outsider McKinley.
