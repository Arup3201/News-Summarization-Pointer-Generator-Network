Nestled in the Durham countryside, Beamish: The Living Museum of the North is filled to the brim with the nation's history.

The vault, in the 300-acre open-air museum, has sets of wooden false teeth, a cow's vertebrate and items dating backs to Roman times up to the 1980s.

The curiosities also include old motorbikes, furniture, toys, rocking horses and even tinned vegetables from 1910 which are stacked high in the warehouse that is the size of 11 tennis courts.

The collection is constantly growing with donations which are used to fill traditionally built houses, shops, banks and stables which form an open air museum on the site.

Crockery, vintages posters, a 50,000 book collection, toys, clocks and wirelesses are also included.
