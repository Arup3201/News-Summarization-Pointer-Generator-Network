Criticised: A senior Tory source said Miss Greening had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon

International Development Secretary Justine Greening is under fire within Government for her ‘flat-footed’ response to the Philippines typhoon.

A senior Tory source said Miss Greening had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon Haiyan and appeared out of touch with the public over a disaster that has touched the hearts of millions in this country.

She is said to have compounded the impression by accidentally saying the disaster had taken place in Indonesia during her first big media statement on the subject.

The source said Miss Greening had been upbraided by George Osborne during crisis talks on Britain’s response to the disaster last week.

The Chancellor is said to have reminded her that her department has enjoyed a controversial 30 per cent increase in its budget and told her to get aid flowing quickly to the disaster zone where thousands perished.

‘There is concern that we’ve appeared so flat-footed,’ the source said. ‘It’s all been so empty and soulless. When she’s talking to the media about our response it sounds like she doesn’t care.’

Treasury sources last night acknowledged that Mr Osborne and Miss Greening had talks on the crisis last week but played down talk of a rift. ‘It didn’t happen like that,’ the source said.

A source close to Miss Greening also talked down the row, saying she ‘did not recognise the version of events’.

But the claims will fuel public concern that too little of the £10billion aid budget is set aside for emergency relief.

Miss
Greening yesterday said the value of official aid to help with the 
disaster had now reached £50million. Public donations stand at over 
£30million.

An aide denied the Department for International Development had been slow off the mark, adding: ‘We are absolutely leading the world in terms of our response.’

On the BBC’s Sunday Politics show, Miss Greening said the  Government had acted as quickly as possible and was now sending warships to help. Miss Greening also said the aid budget should be protected in law, to prevent future governments imposing cuts.

When the Coalition was first formed, ministers pledged to enshrine the commitment in law.

But the legislation has been put on the back burner because of scepticism about the aid budget among Tory MPs and the public.

Miss Greening said: ‘I certainly hope we can find the parliamentary time to [enshrine it in law] but even if we don’t, the key thing is we’ve acted as if that law is already in place.’

However, Miss Greening said some countries, including Pakistan, could lose aid if they failed to collect taxes.

Pakistan is now the biggest recipient of British aid cash.

Critics complain that the country has one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world – just 0.5 per cent of the population. And some believe the country could afford to fund its own development programmes if the wealthy were persuaded to pay their fair share.

Miss Greening said Britain was helping Pakistan to improve its tax take by sending officials from HM Revenue and Customs but indicated that the Government may have to reassess aid budgets for countries that are not doing ‘everything they can’.

She said: ‘I think we will need to look at whether we can keep on funding when a country domestically isn’t doing everything it can.’

Warship HMS Daring also arrived in the Philippines yesterday to spearhead the UK’s emergency response to the disaster.

The Type 45 destroyer docked at the island of Cebu in readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to the city of Tacloban on nearby Leyte island, one of the worst affected areas.

Daring’s Lynx helicopter will today drop shelter kits, food and medical supplies to remote areas that are yet to be reached.
