Neuroscientist and computer genius Demis Hassabis, 37, has sold his company DeepMind to Google for £242million

A comprehensive school-educated computer genius has become a multi-millionaire overnight after selling his company to Google.

Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, co-founded DeepMind Technologies just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans.

His company has yet to produce anything commercially but Google has still paid £242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence. It represents Google’s biggest ever single acquisition in Europe. 

Mr Hassabis told MailOnline: 'We’re really excited to be joining Google.

'This
 partnership will allow us to turbo-charge our mission to harness the 
power of machine learning tools to tackle some of society’s toughest 
problems, and help make our everyday lives more productive and 
enjoyable.'

The website 
states DeepMind uses ‘the best techniques from machine learning and 
systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning 
algorithms.’

A friend of Mr Hassabis said: ‘He has very forward-looking ideas and can spot where industries are heading in the future.’

Programmes
 that predict the way people think and can even teach computers to think
 for themselves are set to be the next big breakthrough in technology.

It
 is believed Facebook had been interested in buying London-based 
DeepMind Technologies, which employs 75 people, but Google has now 
stolen a march on its rival.

Mr Hassabis grew up in Hendon, north London. At the age of four, he saw 
his father, a Greek-Cypriot entrepreneur, playing chess and asked to be 
taught the rules. Within weeks, he was beating his father. A couple of 
years later he was programming computers.

The acquisition by the Californian-based giant is the biggest single purchase in Europe. DeepMind specialises in 'machine learning' designing computers that can learn from their mistakes

The acquisition of DeepMind isn’t Google’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Its
 most recent Hummingbird search update was created to make Google 'more 
human' - searches can now understand context, like a human brain, for 
example.

Its Google Now app
 uses ‘predictive analysis’ to predict what Android users will do next, 
before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever 
being asked. 

Google also hired futurist Ray Kurzweil as Engineering Director in 2012.

Kurzweil
 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to
 upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - 
an event called singularity.

He also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100.

He
 took his A-levels early at just 15 and says his local comprehensive 
kept him on a ‘light rein’ which enabled him to develop his other 
interests. He went on to Cambridge University where he graduated with a 
double first in computer science.

Mr
 Hassabis once said: ‘When my parents saw that I was precocious in some 
areas, they simply encouraged me. In fact, they know nothing about 
computers.’

He set up 
DeepMind with two other entrepreneurs, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. 
The business also counted Founders Fund, the venture firm started by 
Facebook backer Peter Thiel, as an investor. They will share in the 
£242million windfall.

This latest acquisition follows Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries, for example.

However, instead of being used in the robotics division, it is more likely DeepMind, and its expertise, will be used to improve Google's current technologies - including voice and text search. 

Google's most recent Hummingbird search update, for example, was created to make Google 'more 
human' and searches can now understand context, like a human brain.

DeepMind's technology could help develop this further.

Reports claim Google has also agreed to set up an ethics board to make sure the DeepMind AI technology isn’t 'abused', sources familiar with the plans told The Information.

The DeepMind-Google ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology.

This isn’t Google’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In addition to its Hummingbird search update, the Google Now app uses 'predictive analysis' to predict what Android users will do next, before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked.
