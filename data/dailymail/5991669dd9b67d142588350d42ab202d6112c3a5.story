A retired butler who has spent the past 10 Christmases alone has been inundated with offers after placing an advert asking for 
someone to share the day with him.

James Gray, 85, put the unusual request in a newspaper following a decade of lonely festive celebrations at his flat in south London.

The last person he had spent Christmas Day with was his accountant - 11 years ago.

The Irish-born pensioner hoped the advert - which he placed in The Irish Post - would help him find other lonely people to celebrate December 25 with.

However, he was left disappointed when only one person responded to his advert - before later telling him she would be spending the day with someone else.

Now, since featuring on the front of the newspaper, Mr Gray has received dozens of invitations from readers, charities and Twitter users.

He has also received his first Christmas cards in years - with some coming from as far away as New York.

'I'm used to the loneliness but I don't want it to be the same this year,' he told The Irish Post.

'I just had smoked salmon and prawns on my own last year and I
had to put up with it. I think the last time I saw someone on Christmas
Day was when I saw my accountant about 10 years ago.'

'It is so touching to me, after all these years alone, to see this response from people.'

Mr
Gray, who was born in Midleton, County Cork, has had no contact with 
his family since his first cousin died more than a decade ago.

During
his career as a butler, he has worked for some of the UK's most lavish 
homes, including Luttrellstown Castle in Dublin, where he served the 
multi-millionaire Guinness family, according to The Independent.

Yesterday, Liverpool councillor Jake Morrison, 21, said he hoped to invite Mr Gray to a Christmas Day gathering for pensioners - with free travel and a hotel included.

'I always go to 
bingo and I've noticed that instead of feeling quite jolly at Christmas,
some pensioners feel a bit depressed, so I've been talking
to them about it.' he said.

Mr Gray is just one of nearly 500,000 pensioners in Britain who face spending Christmas alone, according to Age UK.

People living alone are more likely to be lonely - with nearly 4million elderly people currently living on their own in the UK.

And the issue is set to worsen over the next two decades -Â  with the number of over-65s living alone predicted to increase by up to 50 per cent by 2033.
