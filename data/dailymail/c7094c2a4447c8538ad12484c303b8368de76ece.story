Lionel Messi has once again cast doubt on his Barcelona future by telling the world he does not know where he will play next season.

The Argentina superstar had shot down suggestions he would join a club in the Barclays Premier League after Barcelona’s 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid on Sunday. 

However, the 27-year-old fuelled talk of a move to Chelsea after naming Blues boss Jose Mourinho as his third choice for the prestigious FIFA Coach of the Year.

Listing Mourinho behind former Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella, who stepped down following the World Cup, and ex-Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, Messi said: 'Mourinho is a great coach. Whether you like him or not as a person, you have to recognise he’s a great coach.'

During a press conference at the FIFA Ballon d’Or gala here in Zurich on Monday, Messi raised the prospect that, perhaps, he could be playing elsewhere by the end of the year.

It was the final question of a 30-minute press call and Messi was asked about whether he might consider bringing his glittering career to a close back in Argentina.

Cristiano Ronaldo had been asked a similar question about whether he had ambitions for one final challenge but, rather than give a few anodyne quotes, Messi’s answer was far more cryptic.

Messi said: ‘I am not sure If I will go back to Newells Old Boys one day. I am not sure where I will be next year. I have always said I will end my career at Barcelona but as Cristiano said, only God knows the future. Things in football can change in football overnight.’

Compare that to Ronaldo, who said: ‘Who knows? Who knows? Only God knows. Listen, I am very happy at Real Madrid. I signed a new deal last year and I am very happy.’

Tensions with Messi and new Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique reached a peak last week when he was left out of the starting line-up for the 1-0 defeat against Real Sociedad.

He has subsequently scored in both his games since - against Atletico Madrid and Elche in the Copa del Rey - but this revelation will increase the scrutiny on relationship between Messi and Barcelona.

After the game in Sociedad, Messi fuelled speculation that all was not well by following Chelsea on his Instagram account, as well as Chelsea players Thibault Courtois and Luis Felipe. He also missed training the following day, complaining that he had felt unwell.
