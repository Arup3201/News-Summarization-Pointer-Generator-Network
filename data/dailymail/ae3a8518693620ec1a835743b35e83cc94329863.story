Germany was plunged into a frenzy of delight when their boys in Brazil sent their Argentine foes packing in the World Cup Final last night.

Over 250,000 people jammed on to the Fan Mile in Berlin to witness manager Jogi Loew's team at work on massive screens set up for the occasion.

They screamed in jubiliation as the one, vital, goal of 'Super' Mario Gotze crushed Argentina's World Cup hopes.

In Munich the beerhalls were packed to capacity with drivers from the main breweries paid overtime to get extra kegs shipped out as the thirsty revellers partied until dawn.

'The scenes are incredible here,' said Juergen Schneider, 24, a baker.

'I have seen pensioners dancing on tables and mothers with babies holding them in the air like trophies. No-one quite believes that we have done it.'

In Hamburg the working girls on the famous Reeperbahn red-light district posted notices in their windows that they were offering discounts of 25 per cent after full time.

Mr Knapp, who now lives in London and works in PR said: 'I think Germany have played really well, but it seems like a remake of the 2006 game when Argentina and Germany played each other, but I think our play deserved a goal in the 90 minutes.

'The atmosphere is great, but what makes this night very special is that we have English men cheering on Germany. Obviously, Germany are disliked in England but Argentina are even more disliked, so it makes it special not to be the most hated team in the country tonight.'

Englishman David Rochford, 30, from Battersea, London, decided to cheer on the Germany team for the game with his friends because of his love for the country.

He said: 'We have been to Berlin quite a few times, and we like the Germans. We have some German friends and like the German people. We love Germany.'

'Also, we have a friend who looks like Jurgen Klopp [Borussia Dortmund's manager] so it was one more reason to support them.'
