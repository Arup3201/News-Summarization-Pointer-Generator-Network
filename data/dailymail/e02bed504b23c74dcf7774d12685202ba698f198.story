After months of teaser trailers and speculation, Sony has finally unveiled its next-generation waterproof smartphone called Xperia Z1 during the IFA consumer electronics conference in Berlin.

At its core it is still an Android phone yet many of the features have been designed to make it more like a high-end digital camera - taking advantage of Sony's expertise in the photography market.

Speaking at the conference, Sony's CEO 
Kaz Hirai added the firm has also designed it based on customer feedback, saying: 'We've been taking time talking to people to better 
understand what they need, what they demand from Sony.'
