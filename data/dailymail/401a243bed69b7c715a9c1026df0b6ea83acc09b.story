UEFA are looking at staging mini-tournaments involving the continent’s leading clubs outside Europe during pre-season, with the United States the most likely location.

European football’s ruling body have been considering ways of increasing global interest in sponsorship and media rights, and elevating games that already involve their marquee teams by giving them UEFA branding and organisation is the preferred option.

Planning for this initiative started two years ago, when UEFA examined staging the qualifying rounds for the Champions League and Europa League outside Europe within a knockout tournament format.

Though that ambitious blueprint could be revisited in future, it was felt taking so many competitive fixtures out of Europe was fraught with difficulties. Nevertheless, countries in Asia and the Middle East, as well as America, will welcome the current UEFA thinking.

UEFA president Michel Platini played the biggest role in persuading David Gill to stand for the British vice-presidency seat on FIFA’s executive committee. Manchester United director Gill had long been considered the obvious replacement when Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce stands down in 2015. 

But he made it clear he was not prepared to be part of a FIFA regime led by Sepp Blatter, which led to the FA to even consider putting forward a current player in Rio Ferdinand for the British VP election. However, the persuasive Platini, backed up by FA chairman Greg Dyke, have changed Gill’s mind, with Platini saying he wanted influential Euro voices on FIFA rather than ‘sheep’ just following Blatter’s lead.

Lord Coe has ‘big problems’ with American drugs cheat Justin Gatlin being nominated as one of the IAAF athletes of the year. Coe’s manifesto when he stands for the IAAF presidency next year, probably against Ukraine’s Sergey Bubka, is expected to have zero tolerance towards double doping offenders such as Gatlin.

Amateur Swimming Association chairman Edward Lord was axed from the FA’s inclusion advisory board with indecent speed after breaking ranks to criticise the lack of action on discriminatory issues. But while the FA sit on their hands on this subject, the good Lord continues to speak out. He used the Liberal Democrats’ conference as a platform to complain about football quartet Richard Scudamore, David Elleray, Terry Robinson and Malky Mackay not facing charges for a variety of discrimination-related comments.

KAISER DUCKS QUESTION 

The difficulties in discovering what really went on in the flawed elections for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was highlighted by Franz Beckenbauer’s bizarre appearance at the Qatar-funded Securing Sport conference.

First ‘The Kaiser’ was only asked about his football career by moderator David Walsh, despite it being a summit about sports corruption. Then former FIFA ExCo member Beckenbauer was ultra evasive when asked by the media about who got his vote for 2018 and 2022 and why he didn’t co-operate with the Garcia World Cup inquiry — which he wants published — until he was banned from football for 90 days.

 Massimo Cellino has fallen out with Stephen Warnock, who accused him of trying to pick the team

Madcap Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has fallen out with senior player Stephen Warnock, who was dropped for the past two games. And Warnock, in a stormy confrontation, accused Cellino of picking the team and is planning to take his complaint to the PFA.

The shock appointment of IMG’s TV rights specialist Tom Harrison as chief executive of the ECB doesn’t necessarily mean vice-chairman Colin Graves, who favoured an outside choice, has won a power struggle with chairman Giles Clarke, who worked with hot favourite Richard Gould at Somerset. Clarke and Harrison also have a close relationship from negotiating media deals.
