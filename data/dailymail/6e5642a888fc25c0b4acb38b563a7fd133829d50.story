Manchester United’s lavish spending has not finished. 

In January another £50million has been allocated to sign more players in the wake of this summer’s £150m-plus spending spree which culminated in the signing of Radamel Falcao.

Arturo Vidal, Mats Hummels and Sami Khedira remain top targets. Juan Mata will be sold in January to accommodate a second wave of rebuilding under manager Louis van Gaal.

Atletico Madrid, Roma and Juventus are in the market for the mercurial Spaniard, who was signed last January from Chelsea for £37m.

United would accept a sale in the region of £20m.

It is said don’t judge a book by its cover.

But the weird front image of a new biography about Bobby Moore suggests otherwise.

I can’t think of a worse, more unflattering picture I have ever seen of Bobby Moore who remains England’s only World Cup-winning captain and who was an inspiration to a generation.

The image makes England’s original golden boy look more like an east London gangster of the Sixties than an icon of whom Pele said was the best, and most handsome, English footballer he had ever seen or played against.

Maybe though that was the point: to depict Moore as an enigma rather than an icon of his time.

Mon: On transfer deadline day Man Utd seal the signing of Radamel Falcao on a loan deal. A few days earlier United had no interest or involvement in signing the Colombian from Monaco.

Tue: The transfer window is briefly re-opened to accommodate United offloading Tom Cleverley to Aston Villa. Seems like big club caveats to me.

Wed: James Milner sums up England's dire 1-0 win over Norway with such a bad pass that would have made Geoff Thomas flinch.

Thur: England boss Roy Hodgson gets angry with a press pack that have not only supported him but given him an easy ride. 

I feel he’s had a crack at two tournaments so should go especially now that he is blaming everyone but himself for England banality.

Fri: A book is launched aimed at tarnishing the reputation of Bobby Moore.

Libero

The formation of the Elite Development League which has taken the place of reserve football has been hailed as a way of improving the standard of young players coming through.

It is essentially an Under 21 team but can accommodate three over age players usually if they are coming back from injury.

Last Monday I went to watch Charlton host Leeds at their training ground in Eltham.

I have to say I was underwhelmed.

There is a lot of talk about how more sophisticated training techniques and tactics under coaches with an attache case full of badges and iPad presentations is improving the game.

But there was little evidence of that.

Sadly I came away with the distinct impression that players are being drilled like robots and constrained with the parameters of whatever the latest fad formation happens to be.

4-3-3 morphing into 4-5-1 has become popular over the last couple of seasons and both Charlton and Leeds played that way.

They both set out to pass the ball out from the back bit more often than not when a route was closed down the ball went back then forward with a long hopeful ball.

The main reason? Not one player on either side was prepared to dribble past an opponent or two thus opening up the game and allowing a passing cycle to continue and set up a chance.

And while both teams had wide men none were wingers in the conventional sense. And it doesn’t matter how many times someone re-writes the coaching manual; wingers with pace, tricky and good crossing change games to break through two sets of back four who able to rely on physical and rugged defending in a match Leeds eventually won 1-0.

The other problem is that the formations were too rigid.

People make the mistake that 4-4-2, for the time being outdated, has been the root of the problem for English football especially at international level.

It hasn’t per se. The problem has been that too many teams, especially England, play a far too rigid 4-4-2, with the flat lines. When the lines are blurred, when there is flexibility 4-4-2 can be as fluid as many formation.

Coaches have got to start giving players freedom of expression and conscious of doing the right thing and staying in their zone but even at this level and at most clubs there is pressure to get results.

So actually it seems there is more emphasis on success rather than development than there was in the days when the stepping stone to the first team was the reserves.

Talent: Oscar Borg (above) has failed to secure a move to Manchester United

I am hearing

One of the country’s best young players, Oscar Borg, has failed to secure a move to Manchester United because of complications over a compensation fee from parent club West Ham, with whom he has been with since the age of 10.

Left back Borg, 16, is also wanted by Aston Villa but as it stands the potential 'new Luke Shaw' is ready to commit himself to the Hammers for the next two years.

But Borg has been contacted by the Turkish FA (his grandmother was born in Istanbul) about declaring his nation allegiance to them and has also has offers from Galatasaray and Beskitas.

It is now being reported that Cristiano Ronaldo is ready to re-join Manchester United next summer.

Regular readers of this column will know Football Grapevine revealed last summer how close Ronaldo was to going back to United.

After long discussions Ronaldo’s advisors decided it was best to get a new mega-deal with Madrid.

Going back? Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) could be ready to re-join Manchester United

But come next summer Ronaldo could be swayed by Man United’s new 'Galactico' recruiting policy.

The key could be Falcao moving on from his loan with United to Madrid, whom he wanted to join last week.

In that respect such a deal would happen if super agent Jorge Mendes wants it to happen.

Mendes currently represents Ronaldo and Falcao.

It is understood that Mendez and his company earned nearly 5m euros for the deal that took Falcao to United, the player having been touted about to PSG, Arsenal Manchester City and Liverpool.

In a fortnight it will be ten years since Brian Clough died.

It was no secret that in latter years of his managerial career that an alcohol problem affected his life.

Sometimes it made Clough hard work for those around him.

But those of who grew up watching football in the Seventies will never forget the two wonderful football sides he nurtured organically at Derby and Nottingham Forest.

A club like Forest winning two European Cups with a cavalier style of football?

Icon: It's hard to disagree with those that say Brian Clough was the best manager England never had

You didn’t have to be a Forest fan to cheer them on and be enthralled by how they played.

And how for so long Clough’s inspiration kept Forest punching way above their weight even when financial muscle started to control who could win titles and cups.

Then of course there were Clough’s outspoken tirades.

I still feel had Clough not Don Revie succeeded Sir Alf Ramsey, Clough would have got the best out of mercurial players such as Alan Hudson, Tony Currie, or Stan Bowles, and a bit later Glenn Hoddle and Laurie Cunningham, and maybe won (or at least qualified for!) the 1978 or 1982 World Cup.

It’s often said that Brian Clough was the best manager England never had. It’s hard to disagree. RIP MR Clough.

BTW

Isn’t it funny how so many people are now lamenting the fact that the England team doesn’t have the option of a 'young' Frank Lampard and Steve Gerrard playing in tandem.

Y Factor

If you are wondering why England’s match against Switzerland is on a Monday night it's because it is part of UEFA’s money orientated plan to spread Euro qualifiers over the weekend to pocket more TV revenue. But as it stands more and more people are losing the appetite to watch England and I can’t see a Monday night slot helping.

Let's see. Why not in future just give the captain’s armband to the player who has the most caps at the start of the game? 

As it stands that is Rooney. But from now on the position should be a symbol of seniority. Not some sort of sinecure.

I-Bet

England are 2-1 to beat Switzerland. I think it will be a 1-1 draw which is 5-1. Coral offer 33-1 for Gary Cahill to be top scorer.
