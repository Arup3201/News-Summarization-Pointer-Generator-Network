Stephen Gaskin, a visionary who established one of the country's oldest surviving communes, located in rural Middle Tennessee, died Tuesday at the age of 79.

Gretchen Bates, who grew up on the 'The Farm' and is close to Gaskin's family, told The Associated Press that Gaskin died of natural causes at his home on the Summertown commune.

A message on The Farm's website reads: 'We mourn the passing of Stephen Gaskin, our founder and friend. Our community would not exist, were it not for his bravery and free spirit.'

Gaskin was a Korean War veteran who became a hippie guru in the late 60s, teaching English at San Francisco State College.

In
 1970, Gaskin led a caravan of 60 school buses carrying about 320 
hippies to 1,750 acres of rough ridge country where they founded the 
back-to-basics collective.

The collective bought the land from a local moonshiner who sold it to them for the cheap price of $70 an acre.

According
 to their website, the group's mission was: 'To live a 
"back-to-the-land" lifestyle while still remaining engaged in social 
change to make the world a better place.'

They
 pooled their money and started making decisions by consensus. Within 
four years the original settlers had bought the land, erected buildings 
with salvaged wood, found water supplies and became agriculturally 
self-sufficient.

Those who 
joined The Farm had to accept Gaskin as their spiritual guru but he 
preferred being known as a teacher and not a leader.

Back to basics: In 1970, Gaskin and a group of 320 hippies moved to a plot of land in Middle Tennessee to start The Farm

He
 described the difference in an early 1970s essay, saying: 'I'm a 
teacher, not a leader. If you lost your leader, you're leaderless and 
lost, but if you lose your teacher there's a chance that he taught you 
something and you can navigate on your own.'

Gaskin
 personally ran into problems though in 1976 when it was discovered that
 marijuana was being grown on the commune during a raid.

Gaskin denied knowing about the weed, but took responsibility and went to prison.

Working the land: Within four years, the settlers had bought the land, erected buildings with salvaged wood, found water supplies and were agriculturally self-sufficient. Above, workers on the farm pictures in December 1971

All together: Members of the commune pooled resources and worked jobs to keep The Farm running

'The
 cops said, "Whose pot is this?"' Mr. Gaskin recalled to The Tennessean 
in 2013. 'And I said, "We're a collective. What's here is part mine."'

He
 served one year of a three-year sentence, and after being released 
successfully fought in the Tennessee Supreme Court to have his voting 
rights restored.

When he returned to the farm, he married wife Ina May Middleton, a nationally-recognized midwife.

By
 1980, The Farm's population soared to more than 1,200 and they were 
finally breaking even. They even branched out of farming and into 
printing, construction and solar power.

Early years: When the hippies first arrived in Tennessee, they lived out of tents until they could finish building homes

Gathering place: The Farm members gather in one of the commune's buildings in 1976, when about 800 lived in the community

But a financial crisis a few years later led to a reorganization in which members began paying monthly dues.

Currently,
 The Farm has about 200 residents. Most of them work in nearby towns, 
while others work within the community for homegrown industries like a 
book publishing company and soy dairy.

In a 1997 interview with NewsChannel5, Gaskin laughed as he described The Farm was a 'gated community of not-rich people'.

In
 addition to his work on The Farm, Gaskin ran an unsuccessful campaign 
in 2000 to become presidential nominee for the Green Party.

Four years later, his work on The Farm was recognized when he was inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame.Â 

For the past few years, Gaskin has remained out of the public eye due to vision and health problems.

He died at home on Tuesday, surrounded by family. The Farm community members have not yet announced plans for Gaskin's funeral.

The Farm continues today, though today it is more of a 'gated community of not-rich people' than strict commune
