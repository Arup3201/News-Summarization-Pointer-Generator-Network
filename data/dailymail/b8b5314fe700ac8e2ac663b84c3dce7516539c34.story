In the future, those with hearing loss may no longer need a cochlear implant - instead they could hear with their mouths.

At least, that's the vision of a group of Colorado researchers who are developing a hearing device that bypasses the ear altogether.

The technology relies on a Bluetooth-enabled earpiece to detect sound and send electrical impulses to an electrode-packed retainer that wearers press their tongue against to 'hear.'

'It's much simpler than undergoing surgery and we think it will be a lot less expensive than cochlear implants,' said John Williams, associate professor at Colorado State University.

Professor Williams came up with the idea for the device during what he calls a 'research midlife crisis', when he also developed tinnitus - a constant, high-pitched ringing in his ears.

He hit upon the idea that the tongue contains thousands of nerves and the region of the brain that interprets touch sensations from the tongue is capable of decoding complicated information.

'What we are trying to do is another form of sensory substitution,' Professor Williams said.

Unlike hearing aids, which amplify sound, cochlear implants circumvent damaged areas of the ear and stimulate the auditory nerve directly.

Microphones outside the ear detect sounds and send them to a speech processor, which analyses the information and transmits it to a receiver where it is converted into electric impulses.

A microphone attached to a Bluetooth earpiece detects sounds and words from the environment.

These sounds  are transmitted to a receiver where they are converted to distinct patterns that represent a word.

The receiver/processor sends these patterns of electric impulses to the electrode-dense retainer fitted to the roof of the mouth. 

The wearer presses his tongue to the retainer to feel the distinct pattern.

With training, the brain is able to 'hear' or interpret that pattern and understand words being spoken.  

The implant sends those impulses directly to the auditory nerve. With training, the brain learns to recognise these impulses as useful sound information.

The Colorado device operates in the same way except electric impulses are sent via Bluetooth to a retainer-like mouthpiece packed with electrodes.

When users press their tongue against the device, they feel a distinct pattern of electric impulses as a tingling or vibrating sensation.

The idea is that, with training, the brain will learn to interpret specific patterns as words, thus allowing someone to 'hear' with their tongue.

The concept is not as far fetched as it first sounds.

Phoneticists can identify specific words from the series of black lines on a sonogram. And people who lose their sight can learn to 'read' words again with Braille.

The notion that the human brain is 'set' by adulthood and therefore, unable to change how it receives and interprets information is inaccurate, said Leslie Stone-Roy, assistant professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.

'We have a remarkable amount of plasticity in our brain even as adults,' she said.

'We now know that is able to make changes and adapt to changes in incoming information, especially stimuli that are of importance to the individual.'

Professor Williams and JJ Moritz, a CSU graduate student, have spent the past year building and testing prototypes of the technology.

Their initial results are promising enough that they have filed a provisional patent for the technology and launched Sapien LLC, a start-up company, to help advance the technology.

Professor Williams and his team believe that, once refined, their technology could turn the world of hearing devices on its ear.
