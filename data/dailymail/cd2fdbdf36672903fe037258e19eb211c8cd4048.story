Former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder David Beckham was among a host of A-list stars watching his old side beat Barcelona at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night

The 39-year-old, who ended his career after a brief spell with the French club in 2013, was with music star couple Jay Z and Beyonce in the posh seats.

As well as the Americans - who recently wrapped up their On the Run tour - France manager Didier Deschamps, former Italy World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Holland legend Patrick Kluivert watched on.

There were a team-full of famous faces from politics, entertainment and sport in the stands to watch Paris St Germain beat Barcelona on Tuesday night

Being the social butterfly that he is, Beckham was snapped chatting to most of the assembled glitterati and at one point looked as if he was explaining some of the rules of the game to Jay Z.

PSG's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic also showed his support from the stands as he was forced to sit out the fixture against his former side owing to a heel problem.

Appropriately with Jay Z in the crowd, Barcelona looked like they had 99 problems, especially at the back.

The hosts took the lead through David Luiz, before Lionel Messi finished off a sumptuous move with a glorious left-footed finish to level proceedings.

However, goals from Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi put the French side firmly in the ascendancy, and despite Neymar reducing the deficit for the visitors, PSG ran out 3-2 winners.
