Arsenal survived the sending-off of striker Olivier Giroud for a reckless headbutt to beat QPR 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium and close back up on the top four of the Barclays Premier League.

Sportsmail's Dave Wood rated the players' performance at the Emirates. 

Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez was always at the centre of the action against QPR

Arsenal (4-1-4-1)

Szczesny 6

Was a virtual spectator for most of the game and beaten by Austin's well-struck penalty.

Debuchy 7

Real threat down the right, linked up with Sanchez and defended well. Harsh award of penalty after he appeared to get a touch on ball before Hoilett went down.

Mertesacker 6

Found wanting in the air again as Caulker went close with header and sometimes wandered up into attack as a right winger.

Tomas Rosicky impressed on his return to Arsenal line-up and scored second goal

Monreal 7  

Solid, unspectacular and important blocks to deny Zamora and Vargas. 

Gibbs 6.5 

Threat down the left, great cross for Sanchez's header. Stood firm in defence.

Rosicky 7

Impressive on his return, involved in best attacks and capped display with clinical finish.

Olivier Giroud overreacted and was sent off for reckless headbutt on Nedum Onuoha

Flamini 6

Directed operations from just inside QPR half. Protected defence after Giroud was sent off.

Cazorla 7

Neat and tiday, found pockets of space around the box and set up first goal for Sanchez.

Sanchez 8

Too quick, too clever, too good. Difference between the teams. Scored first after winning and missing penalty and set up second for Rosicky.

Arsenal held on for victory despite dismissal of Giroud early in the second half

Giroud 4

 Was a real handful before he overreacted and was sent off for headbutt on Onuoha. Stupid.

Welbeck 6

Hustled and bustled but could not fashion an effort on goal. 

Subs

Chambers (for Rosicky 83)

Coquelin (for Welbeck 88) 

Charlie Austin was starved of the ball and forced to chase hopeless causes

QPR (5-3-2)

Green 6.5

Saved penalty after early wobble and had no chance with either goal.

Onuoha 7

Stong, determined and pace was crucial as Arsenal launched wave after wave of attacks. 

Ferdinand 6.5

Kept cool under intense pressure but lack of pace exposed by Welbeck for yellow card

Austin gave his side hope of grabbing a point with a well-struck penalty

Caulker 6.5

Solid. Last ditch tackle to deny Sanchez and went close with header.

Isla 5.5

Pushed back by Gibbs into back five as Rangers were overrun in first half. Went close with header late on.

Mutch 5.5

Struggled to protect the defence and looked better going forward. Taken off in second half.

Henry 5

Could not get to grips with Arsenal midfield and wasteful on few occasions he got the ball.

Armand Traore gave away a penalty with a silly challenge on Alexis Sanchez

Kranjcar 5

Couldn't get hold of the ball and influence the match even when Arsenal wee reduced to 10 men.

Traore 4

Looked out on his feet after 20 minutes. Dived in to concede penalty and switched off for first goal.

Vargas 5

Chile team-mate of Sanchez told goalkeeper Green which way to dive for penalty save

Austin 6

Found himself as an auxillary defender in first half. Starved of the ball for most of the game and forced to chase hopeless causes. Smashed in late penalty

Subs

Hoilett 6 (for Traore 62) 

Saw a lot of the ball, won penalty but final ball lacked quality.

Fer 5.5 (for Henry 62) 

Brought on to inject pace into the QPR attack after sending off.

Zamora 5.5 (for Mutch 71)
