Accident: State representative Leslie Combs was cleaning her gun when it went off in her office on Tuesday afternoon

A state representative in Kentucky caused a security scare when she accidentally fired her gun while cleaning it in her office at the state legislature.

But Leslie Combs has brushed off the accident, claiming that it comes with the territory of gun ownership.

'I'm a gun owner. It happens,' she said today after news of yesterday's accident broke.

The Democratic representative was cleaning her semi-automatic handgun inside her office when it accidentally fired and a bullet ricocheted, hitting a bookshelf.

Local station WHAS 11 reports that a colleague, representative Jeff Greer, was also in the room at the time of the accident but neither of them were injured.

'I was purposely disarming it to put it up because I didn’t like it and I didn’t want to use it any more,' she said.

'I had had it in my purse I carry usually, and I thought "I’m going to put that sucker away."'

State police Sgt. Jason Palmer told The Courier Journal that the single bullet was fired at 2.30pm on Tuesday and was reported to police two hours later.

The investigation has been concluded and they found no suspicious evidence to suggest that it was anything beyond an accident, nor did they find any fragments outside of the office.

Though guns are not allowed inside many government buildings, the law that put that in place in Kentucky expired in 2003 and since Ms Combs has a concealed weapons permit, she did nothing wrong by having it with her. 

Government property: An earlier law banning guns from the Kentucky State Capitol expired in 2003

Legal: Ms Combs has a conceal-carry license meaning she did nothing illegal by having the gun in her office

Fellow state senator Mary Lou Marzian proposed legislation to ban guns from the building 'several years ago, and it did not meet with success,' she told the Courier-Journal.

'I’m certainly not wanting to take guns away from people, but maybe keep them in our cars if people have them to not bring them around to where there are going to be children walking up around the halls,' Ms Marzian said.

Ms Combs also maintains that she is a strong supporter of gun rights.

'I obtained my concealed-carry permit several years ago to better protect my safety, as I travel widely and sometimes at night. I strongly support our Second Amendment rights and our state’s concealed-carry law, and believe just as strongly that gun safety and education must be part of that equation,' she wrote in a post on Facebook addressing the incident.

'I urge everyone to be extremely cautious with their firearm. I know from personal experience how easy it is to discharge a firearm accidentally.
