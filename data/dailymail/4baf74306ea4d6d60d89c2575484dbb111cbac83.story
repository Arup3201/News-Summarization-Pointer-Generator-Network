Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about about everything in between.

Finally, the rumours can be put to rest as buyers are today invited to register their interest in the site's 800 new luxury apartments, costing up to £6million for one of the nine penthouse suites.

Designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vinoly, the complex known as Circus West comprises 1, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments, townhouses and penthouses, with a first occupancy date set for 2016.

Buyers are invited along today to invest in the 800 homes built on the 
Battersea Power Station complex, where prices start at £338,000 for a 
studio and rise to £6million for a penthouse.

Rob Tincknell, Chief Executive Officer
 of Battersea Power Station Development Company, commented: 'We are 
incredibly excited to be welcoming the UK public to the site of one of 
Britain’s most iconic landmarks.

'Over the past few months, we have seen 
enormous interest in this unique development from potential purchasers, 
and we are delighted to be presenting them with an opportunity to be a 
part of what is sure to become a vibrant new town centre in the heart of

Circus West residents will also have 
access to a 5,000sq ft private Residents Club designed by David Linley –
 this club will have a bar, private dining space, library, business 
centre and a cinema.

Preparatory
 work on the first phase, which consists of eight core buildings to the 
West of the 39 acre site, has already begun with construction expected 
to commence in the second half of 2013.

The Battersea Power Station development will create 16.8
acres of public open space with over 400m of river frontage,
of which nearly 6 acres will be a new riverside park alongside
a proposed river-bus facility.

The location of a new public park between the Power Station and the river will be a curated space with an extensive calendar of public events.

The extensive open space around the Power Station will be known as ‘The Circus’ and is only marginally smaller than the
Inner Circle of Regent’s Park.

Upon completion in excess of 15,000 people will work at
Battersea Power Station across retail, hospitality, commercial,
service, community and creative sectors.

This
 will coincide with the start of the renovation of the Grade II* listed 
Power Station, the largest brick building in Europe and one of the most 
significant surviving examples of Art Deco architecture.

The
 London Borough of Wandsworth granted detailed planning permission for 
Phase One of the Battersea Power Station development on 13 December 
2012.

This followed 
the Autumn Statement on 5 December 2012, in which the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer confirmed the UK government’s support for a £1 billion loan 
and a guarantee to extend the Northern Line underground to Nine Elms and
 Battersea Power Station.

Battersea Power Station was designed in 1930 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott 
and J. Theo Halliday.

The first two chimneys were 
completed in 1939. By 1955 the third and fourth chimneys 
were completed making the Power Station the largest brick building in 
Europe.

In recognition of its Art Deco design, the Power Station was given grade II listed status in October 1980.

On the 31st October 1983 the Power Station was closed and the Central Electricity Generating Board launched a competition to find a future use for the building.

The winner of the CEGB's competition to find a future use for the Power Station was the Roche Consortium, quickly taken over by John Broome who announced plans for a Disneyland style theme park costing £34 million.

Throughout the years Battersea Power 
Station, the largest brick building in Europe, has been rumoured to 
become a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about about 
everything in between

However, costs quickly escalated and work stopped in March 1989 leaving the Power Station in its present semi-derelict and exposed state. Since then, the Power Station has been without a roof, it's steel work exposed to the elements and it's foundations prone to flooding.

In 1993 outstanding debts of £70 million were bought from the Bank of America by a Hong Kong based development company for approximately £10 million.

In 2006 Real Estate Opportunities (REO) plc, majority-owned by Irish developer 
Treasury Holdings, purchases the site and appoints Rafael Viñoly’s 
practice to devise a new master plan.

Four years later the London Borough of 
Wandsworth grants planning for a development of 7.9m sq ft – one of the 
largest planning consents granted in central London.

Following 
the collapse of the Irish real estate market, the Irish agency NAMA and 
Lloyds TSB foreclose on REO loans and administrators Ernst & Young 
(E&Y) were appointed.

In June 2012 it was announced that SP Setia and Sime Darby have entered
 into an exclusive agreement with Ernst & Young, NAMA and LloydsTSB 
to purchase Battersea Power Station. Wandsworth Council greets the 
announcement by stating that the deal is 'very good news.' In September 
the purchase was completed.

1926: The site of a super-station at 
Battersea is first mooted, with its proposed location causing a storm of
 protest. Plans are approved by Electricity Commissioners the following 
year.

1930: Battersea A, the first of the two adjacent power stations
 begins to take shape. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott is appointed 
and tasked with connecting Battersea Power Station’s architectural 
features. The steel frame is enveloped in a brick skin and the chimneys 
pre-cast in concrete. Distinctive fluting is designed for the brick 
cladding and chimney bases.

1933: The first two 69MW generating units
 in Battersea A begin operating. Two years later, a further 105MW 
generating set completes Battersea A. Design and presentation throughout
 the finished building reflects its eminent position in the industry.

1937:
 Construction begins on Battersea B. With war imminent, brick and 
concrete covers are constructed for the turbo– alternators and shelters 
built over existing glass.

1939: Construction of Battersea B 
continues throughout World War II. A survey by Architectural Magazine 
finds that the power station is the second most popular modern building 
in the country.

1944: Battersea B comes into service.

1953: With 
the last 100MW set commissioned the overall capacity is 509MW. Battersea
 generates a fifth of London’s power, with 28 stations taking care of 
the rest. It has a higher thermal efficiency than any other power 
station.

1955: The fourth and final chimney is completed, making the power station the largest brick building in Europe.

1975: Battersea A ceases generation after 42 years.

1976:
 Pink Floyd suspends an inflatable pink pig between The Power Station’s 
chimneys, for its ‘Animals’ album cover. Chaos ensues when the pig 
breaks free and flies into a Heathrow flight path.

1980: In 
recognition of its Art Deco splendour, the Secretary of State for the 
Environment Michael Heseltine lists Battersea Power Station as a 
building of special architectural and historical interest.

1982: Battersea B ceases operations.

1984:
 Battersea Leisure wins a development competition run by The Department 
of Environment and The Central Electricity Generating Board with plans 
for a leisure and entertainment complex.

 With initial demolition complete, including removal of the Boiler House
 roof and west wall, funding runs out and Battersea Leisure ceases 
trading.

 the site and embarks on a series of schemes and planning applications.

2006:
 Real Estate Opportunities (REO) plc, majority-owned by Irish developer
