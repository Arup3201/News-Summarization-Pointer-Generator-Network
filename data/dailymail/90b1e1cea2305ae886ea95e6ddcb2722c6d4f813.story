A mass suicide attack which was to target buses in the Afghan capital of Kabul has been foiled.

Intelligence officials seized 11 custom made 'suicide jackets' in the country's ministry of defence, less than a mile from the presidential palace.

Several Afghans, some reportedly soldiers in the Afghan National Army, were arrested and are now being questioned.

The discovery came on the same day two British servicemen were murdered by a renegade Afghan soldier who tried to trick his way into their fortified base.

A British soldier on patrol in Afghanistan: The two men were shot dead inside a British army base in Lashkar Gar

As the Royal Military Police began 
investigating yesterday’s tragedy, it emerged that the gunman went 
berserk after a row broke out at the entrance to the British military 
compound in Lashkar Gah, Helmand.

Lieutenant
 Gul Nazir is said to have arrived in an army vehicle with several men 
pretending to be assigned to guard a delegation of VIPs visiting the 
base.

But when he was challenged by guards 
and told to wait outside, he opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic 
rifle, killing the two men and wounding a third.

Ghulam Farooq Parwani, deputy 
commander of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Helmand, said the gunman 
had told sentries he was providing security for government ministers 
from Kabul.

But there was a ‘verbal clash’ and 
Nazir started shooting. Mr Parwani said: ‘He got close to the troops – 
three or four metres – and he opened fire.’

British forces shot him dead after he
 killed a Royal Marine and a soldier from the staff and personnel 
support department of the Adjutant General’s Corps.

A total of 407 British troops have now been killed since the war began in 2001.

Fifteen Nato troops have been killed 
by their Afghan allies in the first three months of 2012 – one in six of
 all coalition dead.

The attack comes three weeks after 
the deadliest attack on UK troops during the conflict. Six soldiers died
 when their Warrior vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.

Tragic: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told the Commons that details of the incident, which occurred at the British HQ in Lashkar Gar in Helmand province, were still emerging

The joint British-Afghan investigation announced yesterday will try to discover whether Nazir was working for the Taliban.

The renegade soldier was a member of 
 the Fourth Kandak of 3-215 Brigade and had been a soldier for four 
years.

The Taliban said he had been in close contact with them. But a 
military insider in Whitehall said: ‘The Taliban often over-egg their 
involvement for propaganda.’

Yesterday’s killings are the third 
‘green on blue’ attack in which Afghan security forces have murdered 
British servicemen.

On November 3, 2009, an Afghan policeman called 
Gulbuddin – who was angry after being repeatedly disciplined – 
slaughtered five UK troops with an AK47 as they relaxed following a 
patrol in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand.

Six British soldiers and 
two Afghan policemen were wounded. UK military chiefs denied Taliban 
claims that Gulbuddin was working for them.

Then on July 13, 2010, three British troops were gunned down by an Afghan soldier after a row over bottled water.

Sergeant Talib Hussein, 23, who was 
being mentored by the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, launched a 
machine-gun and grenade attack.

Relations between British and Afghan 
forces had flared when a Gurkha temple at the base was vandalised after 
an Afghan was reprimanded for taking bottles of chilled water.

The latest attack follows unrest 
after tensions were inflamed in February when copies of the Koran were 
burned at a U.S. base. And they reached boiling point two weeks ago when
 a U.S. sergeant went on the rampage in Kandahar province killing 17 
villagers, including nine children.

In a Commons statement on the latest 
deaths, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told MPs the attack was ‘a 
deeply personal tragedy’ for the victims’ families.

A U.S. Nato service member was also killed by an Afghan policeman yesterday at a checkpoint in eastern Afghanistan.
