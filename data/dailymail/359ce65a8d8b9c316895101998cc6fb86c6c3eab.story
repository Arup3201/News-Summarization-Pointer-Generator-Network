If you thought DIY was just for the boys, think again.

Some 60 per cent of women in the UK say they are now more 
likely to carry out home improvements than their partners and half consider themselves handier than men, too.

The news comes as more women than ever are homeowners - single women now account for more than one in five UK households.

Do It Yourself: 60 percent of women carry out home improvements themselves, while 78 per cent say their partners are consulted on the planning, design and decor

This perhaps explains why 66 per cent of those questioned said that the materials like paint, plaster and plywood are paid for from 
their personal bank accounts.

The survey, by WD Bathrooms,
 questioned 1,244 Brits and also found that DIY still seems to be the cause of marital 
disagreements.

Nearly a quarter said that doing work around the 
house prompted bank holiday arguments, usually caused by the age-old issue of one party not cleaning up properly.

The most common answer among women when asked why they had taken up DIY was that, ‘it was the only way to get anything done.’

While four in ten women said they wanted 
wanted to stop asking their brothers, fathers and male friends for 
assistance, ten per cent said they took up DIY to increase the value of 
their home, inspired by TV home improvement programmes.

But it's 
not all bad news for men, 78 per cent of women say their 
partners are consulted on the planning, design and decor.

Another recent study into Brit's DIY habits, carried out E.ON Energy, found that just under half of Brits (44 per cent) are guilty of ‘DIY delay’, after failing to complete energy-saving tasks around the home.

The poll found that 61 per cent of the 2,000 respondents to the survey said that bleeding radiators was the tast most people left unfinished.

Some 52 per cent ignored fitting loft insulation and 42 per cent won't get round to a new boiler.

Lynne Wilson, director at WD Bathrooms said: 'It comes as no surprise that as women 
are increasingly spending more on their homes they want to learn skills 
that will potentially save them money on tradesmen.

'DIY is no longer just a man’s domain.'
