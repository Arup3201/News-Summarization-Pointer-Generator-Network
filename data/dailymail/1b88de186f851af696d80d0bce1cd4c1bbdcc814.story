Dani Osvaldo's future at Southampton is on the line after a brutal assault on team-mate Jose Fonte.

Osvaldo has been suspended by the club for two weeks and fined following the incident at the training ground on Wednesday.

Southampton’s fiery striker left Fonte with a suspected broken nose after the clash, which stunned team-mates and officials with its raw aggression.

'Brutal': The striker had a bloody altercation with team-mate Jose Fonte

According to sources at St Mary’s, 
there was blood everywhere following the violent confrontation between 
two of the club’s first-team players.

The
 flashpoint occurred during a high-tempo training session in the 
build-up to the FA Cup fourth-round tie against Yeovil as Fonte marked 
his team-mate closely.

Although
 Fonte is well known among Southampton players for his niggly, 
aggressive approach in training andgames, the Portuguese defender is one
 of the most dedicated professionals at the club.

But Osvaldo was upset by a robust challenge and the pair became embroiled in an ugly confrontation that led to the forward attacking Fonte.

The escalation of the row between the pair was described as brutal, and Southampton’s players, as well as manager Mauricio Pochettino, were stunned by its savage nature.

An emergency meeting of executives at St Mary’s decided to suspend Osvaldo for two weeks as they consider his future.

The incident took place just a week after executive chairman Nicolas Cortese quit the club and was replaced by owner Katharina Liebherr. Despite claims it is business as usual, sources at the club cannot recall an incident as violent as this before. Cortese ran a disciplined ship, but his departure has created uncertainy.

A spokesman said: ‘Southampton Football Club have today suspended striker Dani Osvaldo for two weeks following an incident at the club’s Staplewood training ground.

‘The club have taken swift and proper action for what we consider a breach of the conduct expected of our players.’

Many in the Southampton squad want Pochettino to ditch Osvaldo following his attack on Fonte. Some fear Osvaldo, who is said to be not the most popular among his team-mates, will have a detrimental effect on team spirit.

Osvaldo, 28, who has struggled to adapt to the Premier League, was signed from Roma in the summer for £15million. He was fined and suspended by Roma after he reportedly punched Erik Lamela, now at Tottenham, in 2011.

He has already been fined £40,000 and banned for three games by the FA for his part in the chaotic scenes during Southampton’s 1-1 draw at Newcastle last month.

Pochettino could look to sell him five months after his club record arrival. England striker Rickie Lambert, a target for West Ham, will now stay at St Mary’s given the doubts over Osvaldo’s future.

Osvaldo was not available to comment on Thursday night

Back in 2013, Manchester City’s hugely talented, but often unpredictable striker, Mario Balotelli, came to blows with then-manager Roberto Mancini. The 22-year-old was ordered off the field for a late lunge on teammate Scott Sinclair during training. When he steadfastedly refused to leave, the City boss shoved him towards the touchline and attempted to physically drag him from the field – resulting in a scuffle, which needed the intervention of two coaching staff to bring to an end.

Andy Carroll broke fellow Geordie Steven Taylor’s jaw in a fight at the Newcastle training ground, after he found out that his ex-girlfriend had been sending text messages to Taylor. Although Carroll got his comeuppance, as he was out for a spell with a hand injury, Taylor came off worse, missing the rest of the season.   

Notorious troublemaker Joey Barton attacked teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training session at Manchester City’s Carrington ground. Dabo claimed he was hit several times and was left ‘disfigured’ from the attack, whilst Barton was arrested and later pleaded guilty to a charge of assault. This fight was the final straw for Barton’s City career and he was swiftly sold to Newcastle.

Despite this bust-up not happening on the training pitch, it deserves a special mention. Leicester teammates Dennis Wise and Callum Davidson got into an argument over a game of cards at the team hotel during pre-season training in 2002. The war of words escalated into a full on punch-up, which resulted in Wise breaking Davidson’s nose and jaw. Unsurprisingly, Wise later got the sack.

A routine training game descended into chaos at West Ham when John Hartson kicked teammate Eyal Berkovic in the face. The dramatic act – caught on camera by a fan - occurred after Berko reacted angrily to the Wales striker’s attempt to simply help the Israel international back to his feet, after he had brought him down in a challenge. Berkovic was hospitalised and unable to eat for two days.
