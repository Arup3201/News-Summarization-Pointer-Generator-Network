One of the Australian DJs who made a prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital is to appear at the inquest into the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha.

DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who posed as the Queen and Prince of Wales to call the King Edward VII's hospital in central London when Kate was being treated for a rare form of pregnancy sickness.

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, who transferred them to a colleague who then described Kate's condition in detail, was found hanged three days after the incident.

The inquest will take place in September
- it was due to take place in London this week, but a spokeswoman from 
Westminster Coroner's Court today confirmed it has been adjourned until 
September 12 and 13.

Ms Greig, who has not returned to work since the hoax call was broadcast, has announced she has been granted permission to attend the hearing.

The solicitors Slater & Gordon said in a statement: 'Ms Saldanha's suicide was a devastating tragedy and Ms Greig’s thoughts have been with the family ever since,' according to The Australian.

They said the former 2Day FM presenter will answer 'any questions' the family or the coroner have.

The statement added: 'She is determined to address any questions surrounding her role in these tragic events as part of the inquest'.

Yesterday, it emerged that Ms Saldanha, 46, directly blamed the radio presenters in a suicide letter found by her hanged body.

The note said: 'I hold the Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act.

'Please make them pay for my mortgage.'

The nurse exonerated the hospital from any responsibility in the handwritten letter and pointed the finger of blame at the 2Day FM presenters.

The mother-of-two addressed the message to her managers at the exclusive London hospital.

She said: 'Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank you for all your support.'

An
inquest into Mrs Saldanha's death was due to begin this week but has 
been delayed.

Mrs Saldanha was found dead in nurses accommodation close to the hospital just a few days after the call was broadcast.

She shared a home in Bristol with her husband Benedict Barboza, 49 and their two children, Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14.

The two Australian DJs were sent death threats after the nurse's death was reported across the world

Mrs Saldanha, from Valencia in south-west India, married Mr Barboza, from the nearby village of Shirva, in 1993.

She had been working in England for ten years but was said to be having problems working at King Edward VII.

When she was working in London she lived in nurse’s quarters behind the hospital, returning to the family home on her days off.

It has been revealed that the nurse had been taking anti-depressants for nine months after attempting suicide twice in 2011.

She was closely monitored as a high-suicide risk but her employers were unaware of this.

Questions: Mrs Saldanha's husband and children at her memorial last December. Mel Greig said she will answer any questions Jacintha Saldanha's family have

Ms Greig made the call with co-host Michael Christian, who has since taken a lower profile job at a Melbourne station.

They were sent death threats and hate mail in the aftermath of the prank call.

They rang the hospital impersonating the Queen and Prince Charles and asked questions about Kate Middleton's pregnancy.

Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the radio station, has offered to pay £332,000 into a trust fund for Saldanha's family.

Speaking on behalf of Mrs Saldanha's family, Labour MP Keith Vaz, previously said he hoped the inquest will 'provide answers for the family.'

Miss Greig said in an interview after
the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about
her family and what they must be going through.'

The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'.

In
two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael 
Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, 
but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could 
have foreseen the tragedy.

Recounting
the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about 
the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first 
question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have
ever had in my life.

'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through.

And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.'

Mr
Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks
earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends 
of all those affected.

Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened.

'We
hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting
the love and support that they deserve and need right now.'

Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank.
