When Jodie first had blonde hair extensions fitted, she felt like a Disney princess. But her fairytale turned sour when she attempted to blow-dry and straighten her new locks.

The reason? Because the hairdresser who had fitted the extensions - which were meant to last for three months - had used wax bonds instead of glue to hold them in.

Worse still, she had failed to tell Jodie, a 21-year-old actress, that if she applied heat to the wax bonds they would melt.

Painful: Jodie pulled her own hair out along with the extensions

Instead, Jodie found out the hard way when she attempted to use straighteners to spruce up her locks.

'It was great waking up feeling like Cinderella with long, blonde hair,' explains Jodie. 'But when I went to straighten my hair, the wax bonds started to melt. My hair started matting and sticking together.'

Panicking and in pain from the melting wax on her head, Jodie tried to pull the extensions out but in doing so, ripped out much of her own hair.

She recalled: 'I
 had to pull my own hair out to remove the extensions. I could hear it 
ripping, it was horrible. I was in total shock.'

Brave step: Jody had to let Skyler cut her hair right back to remove the damaged locks

Far from having the thick, bouncy mane she so wanted, Jodie was left with thin, brittle hair and bald patches where her hair had been pulled out.

The situation left her terrified of returning to a hairdresser and low in self-esteem - both of which had a knock-on effect on her job as a singer and actress.

She said: 'I've had to put my career on hold because I don't have the confidence to audition.'

After countless home conditioning treatments failed to revive her locks, Jodie sought the help of celebrity stylist Skyler McDonald on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters.

Skyler was alarmed by the state of Jodie's hair and told her only drastic action would help. She would need to have as much of the matted, brittle hair cut away as possible.

Then she would need to add some more hair extensions to give it length - but this time she would use ones from made from real hair that would be attached with heat resistant glue.

To complete Jodie's make-over, she also used a softer blonder shade of dye on the naturally brown-haired actress, instead of her previous bleached blonde look that was also damaging her hair.

Despite reservations about having her hair cut back and then having to wear extensions again, Jodie was delighted with her new look.

She exclaimed: 'It's a major improvement I like it. The colour is so much better. I love the 
cut it looks so much more healthy and is going to be easy to manage.

She told Skyler: 'Thank you, you have pretty much saved me life.'

For the benefit of those considering extensions, she warned: 'Always get a professional to do your hair.'

One such professional is Sarah McKenna, a hair extensions expert and owner of Vixen and Blush salon in South London.

'Permanent hair extensions are a very safe way of adding instant length to your hair - when fitted at a professional salon with expertise in hair extensions,' she explains.

'Unfortunately there are cheap, poor-quality products available within the hair industry that some salons choose to use. When these cheap substitute products are used, clients invariably have issues.'

And it seems Jodie isn't the only one to have endured a hair disaster caused by dodgy extensions.

'We have many clients who come to us seeking help with poor-quality hair extensions that they had fitted elsewhere,' adds Sarah.

'We advise that they never try to remove the hair extensions themselves, or return to the salon where they had them fitted for a removal. We remove their hair extensions very carefully and gently, usually taking several hours to do so.

'These clients usually do not lose any of their own hair and are relieved to have the waxy hair extensions removed.

'Many clients then choose to have good-quality micro ring hair extensions fitted. We offer to fit test hair extensions, using small micro rings, so clients can wear them at home and see that they are both safe and comfortable.

'Micro ring hair extensions are the safest type of permanent hair extensions method available. There is no glue used with this method and so the fitting and removal is very clean. Micro ring hair extensions last for three months and should be removed by a professional.'
