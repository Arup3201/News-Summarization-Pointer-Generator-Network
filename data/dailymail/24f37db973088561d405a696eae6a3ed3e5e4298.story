A compensation package worth £33,000 could be handed to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile, it has been reported.

The exact amount is expected to be finalised when high court judge Dame Janet Smith publishes the results of her inquiry, which is looking into the culture and practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse, later in the year.

It is believed the amount will be less than the £4.1million the corporation paid to its senior managers, swollen by controversial ‘golden goodbyes’ for bosses forced out over the handling of the Savile affair.

Pay-out: Compensation of £4million or about £33,000, could be paid out to 120 victims of disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile, it has been reported

According to The Mirror the amount of compensation paid out to Savile's victims will equate to just under £4million.

Alan Collins, a solicitor at Pannone, representing a number of the presenter's victims, said it appeared 'unjust' for the victims to receive less than the BBC's senior managers.

He told MailOnline: 'In light of what some of the executives have got it seems wrong - it seems unjust.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'The on-going Dame Janet Smith Review is independent of the BBC.

'It is inappropriate for us to comment on any potential allegations relating to Operation Yewtree or the Dame Janet Smith Review.

'Separately, the BBC will continue to assist the police with any enquiries relating to Operation Yewtree.'

Earlier this month a man of 80 was arrested by police investigating decades-old sex crimes.

The pensioner, who was held at an address in South London, was the 14th man arrested as part of Operation Yewtree.

The controversial investigation was 
sparked by the torrent of victims who came forward as Savile was exposed
 as the most notorious paedophile in British history.

Police said the suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, is linked to the disgraced TV presenter and radio DJ.

The man, who was not identified, was later released on bail until an unknown date in October.

Last week former Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops presenter Dave Lee Travis vowed to clear his name after he was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s.

The 68-year-old, one of Britain’s best known DJs, said he was ‘very much looking forward’ to proving his innocence after being charged as part of Operation Yewtree.

Earlier that week, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, who was originally arrested in June, had his bail renewed until October.

The week before veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, 83, was arrested for a second time.

Comedian Jim Davidson, 59, and his friend and DJ Mike Osman, 53, have been told they will not face charges following their arrests earlier this year.

Gary Glitter, 69, and Freddie Starr, 70, are both on bail.

Two people have been charged. PR supremo Max Clifford 70, is accused of indecently assaulting seven women and girls, and former BBC driver David Smith, 67, is accused of sexually abusing a young boy. They will face trial next year.
