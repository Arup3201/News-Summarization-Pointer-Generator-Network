Sunderland: Pantilimon, Vergini (Roberge 61), van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea (c), Cattermole (Bridcutt 85), Rodwell, Gomez (N'Diaye 71), Mavrias (Watmore 75), Wickham (Altidore 61), Fletcher (Graham 71).

Udinese: Brkic, Danilo (c), Allan, Badu, Bubnjic, Guilherme, Muriel, Widmer, Gabriel Silva, Heurtaux, Thereau.

Goals: Vergini 56, Wickham 58

Two second-half goals ensured Sunderland ended their pre-season campaign with an impressive win over Italian outfit Udinese.

Loanee Santiago Vergini and Conor Wickham were both on target as Gus Poyet's side extended their unbeaten run to three matches.

After a drab first half the hosts came out all guns blazing in the second period, going close through Wickham just after the interval. The England under-21 international was denied by a superb stop from  Zeljko Brkic with his free-kick looking destined for the top corner.

Clinical: Wickham finished with aplomb from the penalty spot to give Sunderland a two-goal lead

Combative: Lee Cattermole gets stuck in during the game at Heritage Park

Raring to go: Rodwell will be itching to get his career back on track with Poyet

Just five minutes later and the hosts did take the lead though, with Vergini tapping home from close range from Jordi Gomez's inswinging corner. 

And just over a minute later the Black Cats doubled their advantage after they were awarded a penalty when Vergini was taken down in the area.

The impressive Wickham made no mistake from the spot coolly slotting home as they inched ever closer to a second successive pre-season win.

The hosts were unfortunate not to receive another spot-kick after Liam Agnew looked to be taken down, before Udinese went on the counter-attack up the other end going close through Luis Muriel - who dragged his shot just wide of the far post.

Sunderland did manage to hold on for a clean sheet though as they recorded another encouraging victory, with their next fixture a trip to West Brom on the opening weekend of the Premier League a week today.
