Martha Stewart has come under fire on Twitter after posting a picture of herself and controversial photographer Terry Richardson spending Thanksgiving together on Instagram.

The 73-year-old domestic goddess shared the image, which also featured photographer Todd Eberle, on her account earlier today, commenting: 'Todd Eberle, left, Martha, and Terry Richardson, right at my farm on Thanksgiving. Each brought me an extraordinary flower photo!'

Within minutes, Ms Stewart's account was flooded with comments from her followers, many of whom were horrified to see her associating with the photographer, who is facing more than a dozen accusations that he sexually abused young models while working with them on various photoshoots. 

'Nothing says holiday like chilling with sex offenders': Martha has been slammed by her fans for her bizarre choice of dinner guest

Work colleagues: The pair met when Richardson photographed the 73-year-old for Porter Magazine earlier this year

The trio were joined at the 153-acre Westchester farm by Kevin Sharkey, Senior Vice President and Executive Editorial Director of Martha's eponymous company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc, who also shared an image of the group, saying: 'Todd, Martha, and Terry you couldn't ask for more amusing dinner partners.'

But Martha's followers were not so thrilled to learn about her choice of dinner guests - and many couldn't resist the chance to share their thoughts.  

'Nothing says holiday like chilling with sex offenders. Nice work lady,' Instagram user lambtoast commented, while b_shaurette said: 'Terry Richardson? Oh Martha, please say it ain't so.'

'Nooo!! I love you @marthastewart48, please remain the icon and trailblazer I know you are and say NO to any association with Terry Richardson!!' underdevon added. 

It is thought that Ms Stewart first met the photographer when he photographed her for fashion magazine Porter earlier this year. 

At the time, a spokesperson for the publication said of the unlikely pairing: 'It is the first time these two controversy-hounds have met but it is, like so much in Stewart’s life, no accident. 

'After debating over a long list of photographers, America’s house-mother superior insisted that Richardson shoot her. "Oh, he is cute," she will say later, when he comes to say goodbye.'

The magazine, along with a number of other fashion publications, including Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, were last year targeted by an online petition calling for the fashion industry to cut ties with Richardson altogether, following a number of allegations from young models about his inappropriate and abusive behavior. 

Under fire: Valentino was criticized earlier this month for using Richardson in its newest fashion campaign

Since the petition was published on Change.org by Londoner Alice Louse, both Vogue and fashion brand H&M have cut ties with the photographer. 

In a statement made to US Weekly, a spokesperson from Vogue said: 'The last assignment Terry Richardson had for US Vogue appeared in the July 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future.'

Last week, high-end label Valentino was criticized by fashion fans after it released its Autumn Winter 2014 campaign, which features Richardson's distinctively-tattooed arms holding a number of brightly-colored accessories. 

It is the fourth time that the brand has worked with the photographer, who has also worked with the likes of Cara Delevingne, Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. 

Richardson has continued to deny the allegations made against him, writing on his blog: 'I just want to take a moment to say I’m really hurt by the recent and false allegations of insensitivity and misconduct.

'I've always been considerate and respectful of the people I photograph and I view what I do as a real collaboration between myself and the people in front of the camera.'
