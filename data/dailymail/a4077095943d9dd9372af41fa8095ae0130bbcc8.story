From Myleene's pristine white bikini to Helen Flanagan's blue leopard print, picking the right bikini for the I'm A Celebrity jungle shower can be all the impetus a flagging career needs to go stellar.

And that lesson hasn't been missed by the stars of this year's show, who have already taken to flaunting their figures in an array of glamorous bikinis come bath time.

Leading the pack is former Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, who cheekily bared her behind as she took to the shower on her first night in the Australian jungle.

Also keen to show off her style credentials was model Nadia Forde, 25, who flashed the flesh in a daring tribal print triangle number, and the now-departed Gemma Collins, 33, for whom even the prospect of a bikini boost wasn't enough to stop her leaving.

Stripping off: Model and TV show star Nadia Forde has already been flashing the flesh in the jungle - so will this help her secure stardom outside of Ireland?

Flaunting it: The 25-year-old reality TV star went for the cheeky breast grab as she cooled off on the show earlier this week

Model turned designer? Perhaps Nadia could forge a career as a bikini designer after fashioning her own out of leaves and string in the jungle this week

I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Rear! Kendra Wilkinson, a fotmer Playboy bunny, lifted up her towel to expose her pert derriere and insisted she would have to work out ahead of Nadia joining camp

Cold, Gemma? Miss Collins was only in the jungle for three days but she still managed to squeeze in a quick shower scene

More modest: Gemma, 33, has since quit the show but took time to have a cold shower in her modest black swimming costume

Iconic: Myleene Klass became more famous for her white bikini-clad shower scene in 2006 than her jungle antics and now she's a household name 

Pageant queen: Amy Willerton was relatively unknown when she entered the jungle last year but has since gone on to land herself men's magazine covers and numerous modelling gigs - so was it thanks to her shower scenes?

Seeing a flash of a good bikini bod has become as synonymous with I'm A Celebrity as the sight of some D-lister eating a witchetty grub.

It can work wonders on sales of swimwear and on the wearer's career. Just look how Myleene Klass reinvented herself from pop princess to pin-up and Helen Flanagan's transition from teenage Corrie star to FHM's sexiest woman is case in point.

Thanks to Myleene, sales of white bikinis sky-rocketed. Then Helen Flanagan tried her luck in one similar, and even Matthew Wright had a go, as scary as that was!

Gemma Collins attempted to get in on the action and she donned a black one-piece, which looked great on her.

And that's the point. Wearing swimwear that is right for your shape and which flatters your assets is paramount. It's so unsightly if you get it wrong and, to be honest, very unfair on other beach users.

Be careful in a triangle cut top if your breasts are too big, one cut slightly higher and supported is better and much more flattering. If you've got broad shoulders, opt for a halter-neck which balances your dimensions.

If you're looking for bikinis which are slimming, try one with clever contouring trims on tops and high-waisted bottoms, and if you're short then wear a slinky bikini with spaghetti straps.

If you're feeling daring, reach for something with cut-out details on the sides, but be careful of those which feature metal rings... imagine them in the heat! 

Catapulting her to stardom: Helen Flanagan's bikini scenes in 2012 helped promote her from Coronation Street sweetheart to lad mag favourite - and she even topped FHM's Sexiest Woman in the World poll 

From Essex to stardom: Not only did Stacey Solomon, 25, take home the jungle queen crown in 2010 but she's since landed numerous campaigns and modelling gigs 

Remember me? Hollyoaks and Casualty actress Gemma Atkinson was one of the show's original bikini babes when she starred on the reality TV show in 2007
