A mother-of-four lost 10st the hard way after being refused gastric surgery when she weighed 22st.

Charlotte Green, 39, of Cannock, Staffordshire, was told by her GP that she was not large enough to qualify for a gastric band surgery, despite suffering a uterine prolapse caused by her obesity a year previously.

Devastated by the refusal, Mrs Green was inspired by her rugby-playing husband Richard, 37, to hit the gym and she slimmed down to 12st purely through hard graft and changing her diet.

After being refused weight loss surgery on the NHS, Charlotte decided to take control and began exercising and found she loved it, running four times a week. Now (pictured left and right) she weighs a healthy 12st and says she's 'addicted to exercise'

She said: 'I was gutted when I was told I couldn’t have the surgery. I really felt as if I deserved it, considering what I’d been through. But Richard picked me up, and convinced me that I’d be able to slim down if I started getting some exercise.

'He persuaded me to join a gym and I quickly became obsessed. I went more than four times a week. I loved running.'

Charlotte, who works in children’s services, found it difficult to control her weight gain following the births of her children Elicia, now 21, Olivia, 19, George, 14, and Harrison, 10.

She said: 'After each of the births my weight crept up and despite trying diets, I couldn’t seem to do anything about it. Biscuits and chocolate were my downfall.

'I got post-natal depression after each of the births, and I comfort ate. As my weight went up, the depression hit me harder, so it was a bit of a circle.'

In 2005, Mrs Green began experiencing excruciating abdominal pains.

She said: 'It was quite scary while I waited for the tests to come back.

'The doctor said my womb had collapsed onto my bowel because I was overweight, and that the only course of action was a hysterectomy.

'I was gutted. Even though I had four beautiful children, I was only 30 years old and I felt I was quite young to be getting a hysterectomy. I hadn’t ruled out the possibility of having more children in the future.'

Breakfast: Toast

Lunch: Ham sandwiches

Dinner: Large portion of pasta

Snacks: Numerous bars of chocolate

Breakfast: Grapefruit

Lunch: A tuna salad

Dinner: Grilled chicken and fresh vegetables

Snacks: None

A year later, her weight having reached its maximum of 22st and wearing size 26 clothing, Mrs Green decided to ask her doctor about whether she could have bariatric surgery on the NHS.

She said: 'I felt I had no options left. It was very difficult to be told ‘no’. My GP made it quite clear that I didn’t fall within the criteria for surgery.

'I came home very sad, but Richard persuaded me that I could lose weight through exercise if I really wanted to.

'I’d hardly set foot inside a gym before, but once I got in there, it wasn’t so daunting. I found that I loved working out on the treadmill.

'I soon became obsessed with exercise. It was like an addiction.'

Mrs Green also completely overhauled her diet.

Before beginning her weight loss journey, she typically ate toast for breakfast, followed by ham sandwiches for lunch, followed by an extra-large helping of pasta for dinner. She would snack on chocolate throughout the day.

Today, she eats grapefruit for breakfast, followed by tuna salad for lunch, with grilled chicken and fresh vegetables for dinner.

After 15 months of hard work, Mrs Green hit her target weight of 12st.

Today, despite suffering from damaged joints because of her previous inactivity, Mrs Green maintains her healthy diet and exercise regime.

She said: 'It wasn’t my plan to be turned down for surgery but in the end I’m glad I was. It meant I had to change the way I thought.

'I have been left with some excess skin which I’m hoping the NHS will be able to help me get removed. I’ve been told that it might not be possible, which I’m very disappointed about, but I hope they change their minds.

'I’m much fitter and happier now, and I feel all the better knowing that I did it through my own effort.'
