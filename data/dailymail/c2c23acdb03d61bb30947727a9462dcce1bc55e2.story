Journalist Mazher Mahmood suggested ‘sex for payment’ in exchange for a film part during his botched sting on singer Tulisa Contostavlos, court documents have revealed.

The former X-Factor judge also suspected her personal psychic was recruited by The Sun to ‘influence events’.

She even believes her drink was spiked as the 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood plied her with tequilas during a binge at a central London hotel.

The revelations come as it was revealed she will open up about her 'horrific' ordeal in a BBC3 documentary to air next week.

Tulisa was cleared of helping to supply Mahmood half an ounce of cocaine worth £800 to secure a Hollywood role.

The ex N-Dubz star was alleged to have brokered the deal for the journalist while he was posing as a wealthy Bollywood filmmaker named Samir Khan.

She was promised a starring role in a Slumdog Millionaire style rags-to-riches story alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

During pre-trial argument which can now be reported, Tulisa’s barrister Jeremy Dein QC, attempted to have the case thrown out before it went to trial.

In documents, submitted to Judge Alistair McCreath Mr Dein claimed Mahmood and his team used a variety of tactics to entrap Tulisa, including ‘sex for payment’ with the journalist.

Following a meeting in Las Vegas, Tulisa was 'desperate to obtain the part' in the film, the court heard.

On 10 May 2013, Tulisa met the undercover reporters at London’s Metropolitan Hotel for what turned out to be a six-hour drinking session.

‘Throughout the evening, Samir and his teams were plying TC (Tulisa) and her companions with alcohol, in particular Mojitos and Platinum tequila shots,’ the document states.

‘Samir commented on the expensive drinks he was ordering, but encouraged TC and her party to drink.

‘He and his associate were, unbeknownst to TC, not in fact consuming alcohol; all the while they were cajoling and persuading [their] victims to drink so much they became intoxicated.

‘As a consequence of drink, the events of the evening have become blurred for TC.

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos will open up about her 'horrific' ordeal in a BBC3 documentary to air next week.

The singer, 26, told yesterday, after her trial for allegedly brokering a drugs deal collapsed, how a year of her life had been 'ruined'.

Cameras have been following the former N-Dubz singer since the story appeared in the Sun on Sunday.

The documentary, to be broadcast on Monday, will also feature Contostavlos talking to programme makers about her experience after the judge formally threw out the case.

BBC3 channel editor Sam Bickley said: 'BBC3 has had exclusive access to Tulisa all the way through her ordeal and this hour long documentary will bring you her true story, as events unfolded.'

Yesterday the singer issued a scathing broadside at undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, who was the main prosecution witness, after a judge said there were 'strong grounds' to believe he had lied on the witness stand and 'had been manipulating the evidence'.

The Sun on Sunday suspended the journalist known as the Fake Sheikh amid questions over whether he could now face a perjury investigation.

Contostavlos, who had denied brokering a drugs deal, appeared on the steps of the court and called the case 'a horrific and disgusting entrapment by Mazher Mahmood and the Sun on Sunday newspaper'.

She previously appeared in BBC3 documentary Tulisa: My Mum And Me, about being a carer for her mother, who suffers from a mental illness.

The show airs at 10pm on BBC3 on Monday night.

‘She recalls parts, but not all. Her recollection as to detail is inevitably impaired.

‘There was discussion of a very wide range of topics. At one stage, TC referred to her problems with depression and the assistance she had in falling asleep from occasional use of ‘weed’.

‘Thereafter, Samir referred repeatedly to weed, and encouraged discussion of it.’

The document continues: ‘In the thick of these events, TC was accompanied to the lavatory by Nish (Mahmood's colleague). There, Nish told TC that she could expect a fee of £3.5m for her part in the film.

‘Nish pretended that she really wanted TC to get the part and commented that TC needed to show she was suitable for the role.

‘Nish said words to the effect that TC should remember her past.

‘This was highly manipulative conduct designed to lure TC into further drug-related talk and activity, while creating an enormous financial incentive for her to do so.

‘TC responded to Samir’s luring and ‘egging on’ by talking further about cocaine, believing that this was what Samir wanted to hear, she hoped to increase her prospect of securing the part by doing so, and believed she could.

‘TC’s talk of involvement and connection with cocaine was similarly made up by her, but well received by Samir.

‘This was done to please the film-makers, to increase her prospects, not because it was true.

‘In addition, TC recalls that Samir diverted the conversation to celebrity prostitution, with reference to someone known to Samir.

‘TC understood Samir to be hinting at sex with TC for payment.

‘There was a stage of events when Nish attempted to ‘prise’ GV away from the party, suggesting that it would be best if the businessman were left with TC and [friend] Michelle who, by now, was extremely drunk.

‘GV was fearful for TC’s safety if left alone with Samir and he resisted the suggestion.’

The reporter went on to talk about ‘liking white girls’ before ‘Nish eventually suggested that TC go to Samir’s bedroom alone’.

‘Again, TC perceived that sex for payment was being suggested. She declined the offer.’

Mr Dein went on to claim that Tulisa believed her drinks had been spiked that evening.

Yesterday, Tulisa’s trial collapsed after Judge McCreath concluded Mahmood’s lies had fatally undermined the prosecution.

Mahmood had told the court during legal arguments last month that he had not discussed a witness statement given by his driver Alan Smith.

However, while under cross examination on Thursday Mr Mahmood confessed to speaking with Mr Smith about his statement which was later changed to drop Contostavlos’ comments on drugs.

News UK announced yesterday Mahmood was ‘suspended pending an immediate internal investigation’ after claims he lied to the court.

Contostavlos of New Southgate, north London, denied being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

Michael Coombs of Enfield, north London, pleaded guilty to supplying a class A drug to another but was acquitted by the jury.
