A large panel fell off a plane mid-flight leaving a gaping hole in the aircraft while 148 passengers were on board. 

An investigation has been launched after the panel came away from the fuselage on the Air India 787 Dreamliner on Saturday. 

It is the latest in a series of mishaps since the high-tech jet was introduced two years ago.

Boeing said the loss of the fuselage panel posed no safety risk to passengers.

The jet was carrying 148 people including crew on a flight from Delhi to Bangalore, The Times of India reported.

The pilots did not realise the eight-by-four-foot panel was missing until after the flight landed, adding that India's aviation authorities are investigating.

Boeing said the missing panel fell from the underside of the plane on the right side.

Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said: 'It was
the mid-underwing-to-body fairing located on the belly of the airplane 
on the right side.

The part 'provides a more aerodynamic surface in flight.'

He
said Boeing is working to understand what caused the panel to fall and 
declined to say whether the plane was made at Boeing's South Carolina 
factory. 

A number of Air India jets have come from that assembly line.

According
to reports, the panel was replaced with one taken from a just-delivered
787 Dreamliner that was not yet ready for service. 

It is believed that plane is now awaiting a spare part. 

Problems with the 787 include battery overheating that prompted 
regulators to ground the entire fleet in January. 

Flights were eventually resumed in April.  In July, a fire broke out in an empty aircraft that was parked at Heathrow.

Only
last week two Dreamliners were forced to abandon flights within 24 
hours because of separate techincal problems with the toilets and 
de-icing system.

Japan Airlines Co was forced to turn around its Tokyo-bound flight from Moscow today due to a problem in the jet's lavatory.

JAL spokesman Takuya Shimoguchi said the toilet malfunction was likely caused by an electronic glitch.

Another
JAL Dreamliner heading for Tokyo was diverted back to San Diego because
of a possible problem with the aircraft's de-icing system.
