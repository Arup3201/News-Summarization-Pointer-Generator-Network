Elizabeth Webber Harris is the only woman to ever be 'awarded' the Victoria Cross

On the Indian frontline in 1869, Elizabeth Webber Harris risked her life to nurse soldiers hit by a deadly cholera outbreak back to health.

As the only woman serving alongside the Bengal Fusiliers in Peshawar, she saved more lives with her ‘tender consolations’ than a surgeon did with his medicines.

Her bravery and selfless devotion earned her an honorary Victoria Cross – making her the only woman to ever be ‘awarded’ the highest military honour in Britain.

With women ineligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1921, she was never officially recognised for her efforts.

But her regiment were so struck by her ‘indomitable pluck’ that, after obtaining Queen Victoria’s special permission, they had a replica gold VC made for her.

And as no woman has been awarded the honour since 1921, Mrs Harris’s unofficial medal makes her the only female recipient.

The remarkable story of her life emerged in detail for the first time yesterday, as her gold medal is set to go on display at the Imperial War Museum in London next month.

Speaking about her heroic efforts, Lord Ashcroft, who owns the medal, said: ‘Elizabeth Webber Harris was a remarkable woman who risked her own life to save others with her selfless devotion in nursing the sick.

‘She was both courageous and inspirational in the manner in which she dealt with a cholera outbreak in India in 1869.’ 

He added that the officers of the 104th Bengal Fusiliers, who presented her with the replica, ‘summed it up perfectly when they said the award was for her “indomitable pluck”’.

Born in Kent in 1834, she married Webber Harris, a captain in the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers – later renamed the 104th – in 1859.

Women were ineligible for the Victoria Cross until 1921, but Queen Victoria gave permission for a gold replica to be made for Mrs Harris to reward her for her ‘indomitable pluck'

In October 1868, the newly-promoted Major General Harris took the 104th to Peshawar, having anticipated trouble on India’s north-west frontier.

However, in 1869 cholera swept India and by August the soldiers were infected.

On September 17 part of the regiment went to a temporary camp in the countryside, with the remaining soldiers joining them five days later. By then, many soldiers and their families had already died from the disease and Mrs Harris was the only woman to go with them.

In her mid-30s at the time, she spent three months nursing the sick and keeping up their spirits, moving through the baking Indian countryside to take care of the regiment as they moved stations.

Even with her own life in danger, Mrs Harris did not stop her efforts to help the men beat the disease.

One night she was attacked by two tribesmen who seized her horse in an incident she described as ‘alarming’. When the regiment finally returned to Peshawar, she said: ‘I was treated as a heroine’.

At a regimental dinner in 1869, one member of the 104th said: ‘The Surgeon of the Regiment declared that by her energies and tender consolations, she had been the instrument of preserving more lives than he had been able to save with his medicines.’

Her husband added: ‘None of those who were with the Regiment during that awful cholera season in 1869 will ever forget Mrs Harris’s devotion to the sick.’

In June 1921 a magazine article said: ‘Throughout their trying time in the isolation camp Mrs Harris remained with the regiment and it was largely owing to her indefatigable exertions that the losses of the regiment were not infinitely heavier than they were.’

The 104th officers felt Mrs Harris had lived up to the traditions of the Victoria Cross and in 1869 she was awarded with the honorary medal.

A letter to the Times stated: ‘It is said that it was suggested to Queen Victoria that Mrs Webber Harris might be given the Victoria Cross, but this was, of course, not possible, so the gold replica was made and presented to her instead.’

Mrs Harris later wrote: ‘It is a most beautiful ornament, and will always be my most cherished possession.’

She died in London in 1917. Her medal will be displayed at the IWM from next month in celebration of International Women’s Day, which was held on Sunday.
