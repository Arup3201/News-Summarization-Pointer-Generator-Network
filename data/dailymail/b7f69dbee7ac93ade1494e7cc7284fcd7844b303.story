Authorities say the man suspected of killing a police officer in a Tupelo, Mississippi bank robbery last Monday has been killed trying to carry out another heist in Arizona.

According to ajc.com, the agency made the connection late Sunday and announced that the bank robber subject of a nationwide search was shot and killed outside a Phoenix bank yesterday.

His name was not released.

On exiting the bank the man encountered a police detective and shots were fired, CNN reported, it is not believed the detective was wounded.

The new and final development in the case came just hours after the FBI announced that the man was a serial bank thief and had attempted a robbery just hours before his fatal heist in Mississippi.

Wanted man: Police had a reward of  $100,000 on the suspect, who is believed to now be dead

suspect entering a Bank of America branch in Atlanta, armed with a 
semi-automatic handgun and wearing a black ski mask.

In a wanted poster, the suspect was described as 5-foot-8 to 6 feet tall with a slender build.

Police first started chasing the suspect on Monday when he conducted a robbery at a BankcorpSouth branch two states away in Tupelo, several hours after the Atlanta incident.

whom he served a tour in Iraq.

strength of the community keeps the family strong.
