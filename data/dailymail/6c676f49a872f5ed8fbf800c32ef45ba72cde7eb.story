Former Leinster and Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll has taken a new step in his career by joining BT Sport as a rugby pundit for the coming season.

Not many teams can boast both Champions League and Heineken Cup winning members, but that's exactly what BT Sport have after adding Brian O'Driscoll to a roster that already includes Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.

The broadcaster has confirmed that, like Mourniho, O'Driscoll will work as both a pundit and an ambassador for them.

The 35-year-old is ther most capped player in rugby union history as well as number eight in the all-time international scorers list and viewers will be hoping he can bring that experience with him to the TV screen.

The enigmatic centre finally hung up his boots last season after a career that saw him captain both Ireland and the British and Irish lions, win two Six Nations Championhsips and 3 Heineken Cups.

For fans who feared O'Driscoll's retirement would spell the end of his presence on their screens, they need not have feared. He will appear for BT Sport on both European Rugby Cup Championship and Rugby Tonight.
