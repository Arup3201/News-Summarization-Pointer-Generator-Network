Jose Mourinho has revealed that he signed  Raphael Varane for Real Madrid in 2011 despite the  defender having 'one foot at Manchester United', and  footage of the centre back in training for France shows why he was so in demand.

Receiving a high ball, the 21-year-old flicks the ball up with his right foot bent behind him and nonchalantly volleys the ball back from where it came with his left.

The sublime piece of skill comes as Chelsea boss Mourinho has revealed how close the defender was to joining Manchester United three years ago, until he swooped to sign him for Real.

Raphael Varane calls for the ball, flicks it with his right foot and catches it perfectly on the volley

The defender played for France against Portugal on Saturday and helped Les Blues to a 2-1 win 

2014-15: Eight appearances, 0 goals, two clean sheets

2013-14: 22 appearances, 0 goals, eight clean sheets

2012-13: 28 appearances, 2 goals, seven clean sheets

2011-12: 13 appearances, one goal, five clean sheets

Total: 71 appearances, three goals, 22 clean sheets

14 France caps, 0 goals

Mourinho told Telefoot: 'I was on holiday and in Madrid. Zinedine Zidane arrived with a DVD and I thought, "That player, with two years' work with us, would be fantastic".

'Varane had one foot at Manchester United but Real Madrid are very strong and Rapha came to us.'

The Portuguese manager also tried to sign the Frenchman in the summer for Chelsea, but he has since signed a new contract with Real, and Mourinho said the centre back would not be moving to Stamford Bridge.

The 51-year-old added: 'I like Varane, but everybody knows that he will stay at Real Madrid.'
