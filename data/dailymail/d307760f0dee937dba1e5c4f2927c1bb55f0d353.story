A wallaby believed to be living wild in the British countryside is a domestic pet on the run after his owner tried to send him to Germany, it was claimed today.

The marsupial, usually found in Australia, shocked local residents in Cambridgeshire when it was spotted hopping across the road and through woodland over the weekend.

Experts claimed it was descended from a group that has lived in the wild for 60 years after escaping from a zoo but now it seems the rogue wallaby was acting alone.

Wallaby on walkabout: First thought to be living wild in the British countryside when he was spotted by locals, it has been revealed that the marsupial is actually William's pet

Called Skippy, the wallaby hopped over a hedge in owner William Fernando’s garden a day before he was due to be flown to his new home on the continent.

Seventeen-year-old William, who trades exotic animals, had spent the last week trying to catch the walkabout wallaby with no luck despite the sightings in his village of Barton.

Police officers did catch the animal in the early hours of Sunday morning but were told by experts to let it go, believing it had probably spent all its life in the wild.

Now William has teamed up with specialists from Shepreth Wildlife Park in a bid to recapture Skippy.

'No one would believe me': Skippy was spotted by a taxi full of passengers late on Friday night. Jessica Wiltshire took this picture which led experts to claim it was a descendant from a wild group who had lived in the countryside for 60 years

Hopped the hedge: Owner William has spent the last week trying to catch the wallaby but with no luck, 'he was much to quick for me,' he said

Freedom dash: William had only had Skippy for six weeks after acquiring him from a private collector in South Yorkshire. He kept him in the large enclosure pictured

He said: ‘Skippy was meant to be going to a new owner in Germany but he obviously got wind of the move and decided he’d prefer to stay in England.

‘I was cutting the grass last Friday with the lawn mower and I think it must have spooked him because he did a huge leap over the picket fence and bounced off into the field behind our house.

‘I tried to run after him but he was much too quick for me.’

Bigger than a dog: Ms Wiltshire thought it was a deer or fox until she got closer

Mr Fernando has had Skippy, an adult 
male wallaby, for around six weeks after acquiring him from a private 
collector in South Yorkshire.

He
had planned to take Skippy, who usually lives in a large enclosure, to 
Germany last Saturday, before he made a dash for freedom.

Skippy
made headlines earlier this week when taxi driver Tomas Tarjan, 32, 
spotted the wallaby hopping across the road while taking a group of 
girls home in the middle of the night.

He
said: 'This is the weirdest thing I have seen. I said to the girls I 
was sure we did not live in Australia. We spent 40 to 50 minutes 
searching for the animal.

'As I had my hazards on, several taxis stopped. When I said we were looking for a kangaroo they just asked me if I was alright.’

Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi, said she thought it was hilarious and managed to snap a picture of the marsupial, usually found in the Australia.

She said: 'I quickly got my phone out and took a picture of it because I thought no one was going to believe me.

‘We thought it was a deer or fox in the road so the cab driver slowed down, but when we got closer we realised it was a wallaby.

‘It looked just like Skippy the kangaroo and was up on its hind legs, staring at us in the dark. It was a little bigger than an average dog.’

Still on the loose: Police did catch Skippy on Sunday after the sightings in Barton (pictured) but let him go after experts said it had probably spent all its life in the wild

After Skippy was released by police residents continued to spot the wallaby.

Roger Northfield, a 70-year-old entomologist, photographed him on a farm belonging to the Countryside Restoration Trust in Barton, Cambridgeshire.

He said: ‘I was out looking for insects 
when I saw it at a distance. I moved closer and closer to it, taking 
pictures. I knew that a wallaby had escaped.

Wallabies are members of the kangaroo clan found primarily in Australia and on nearby islands.

Wallabies are typically small to medium-sized mammals, but the largest can reach 6feet from head to tail.

Motorists were warned to take caution on the A40 near Highnam, Gloucestershire after police received a number of calls from people saying they had seen a wallaby or kangaroo in July this year.

A colony of wallabies made the Cornwall countryside their home after they escaped from a farm about five years ago. Several sightings were reported in 2010 of a male, female and baby in the St Breward area.

‘I was surprised to see it but I thought it might pop up.’

Experts had said that they believed the marsupial was descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire, in the 1950s.

Experts believe the resourceful group have managed to survive off shrubs and vegetation and even breed despite the harsh British winters.

That was until it was discovered that a wallaby had escaped from Mr Fernando’s care.

Rebecca Willers, animal manager at Shepreth Wildlife Park, said: ‘We had a call from someone in the village who said there is a resident who keeps wallabies as pets.

‘It is highly likely that it is a pet as it is alone and they usually are found in groups.

‘I called the police again to make them aware it was probably a pet and I am willing to offer the owner our services to recapture the animal.’
