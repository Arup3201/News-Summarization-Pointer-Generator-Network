An anonymous U.S. official's
reported description of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a
'chicken***t', or worthless coward, drew a sharp response on
Wednesday from the Israeli leader – no stranger to acrimony with
the Obama administration – and a slam from America's Republican House Speaker.

The American broadside, in an interview in The Atlantic, followed a month of heated exchanges between the
Netanyahu government and Washington over settlement-building in
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians seek as the
capital of a future state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The White House soft-pedaled the insult as 'counterproductive' but offered no apology and didn't identify the official involved.

'The thing about Bibi is, he's a chicken***t,' the
unidentified official was quoted as saying, using Netanyahu's
nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the
U.S.-educated former commando.

'The assault on me comes only because I defend the State of Israel,' Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said after an unnamed Obama administration official called him a 'chicken***t' in a conversation with a reporter

Otherwise occupied: Obama ducked mention of the controversy by spending his day focused on Ebola – meeting with doctors and nurses in an orchestrated photo-op

'The good thing about Netanyahu is that he's scared to
launch wars,' the official said, alluding to past hints of
possible Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear
program. 'The bad thing about him is that he won't do anything
to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the
Sunni Arab states.'

Netanyahu, the official was reported to have said, is
interested only in 'protecting himself from political defeat ...
He's got no guts.'

Israeli leaders usually do not respond to comments by
unidentified officials. But Netanyahu addressed those remarks
directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an
Israeli cabinet minister assassinated by a Palestinian in 2001.

'I am not prepared to make concessions that will endanger our state,' Netanyahu said.

'Understand, our national interests, topped by security and the unity of Jerusalem, are not what top the interests of those anonymous forces attacking us, and me personally.'

'I am under attack simply because I am defending the State of Israel. If I didn't stand firm on our national interests, I would not be under attack.'

'Our supreme interests, chiefly the security and unity of
Jerusalem, are not the main concern of those anonymous officials
who attack us and me personally, as the assault on me comes only
because I defend the State of Israel,' the Israeli prime minister added.

'Despite all of the attacks I suffer, I will continue to
defend our country. I will continue to defend the citizens of
Israel,' he said.

Such pledges by Netanyahu have resonated among Israeli
voters, even amid fears his strained relations with U.S.
President Barack Obama could ultimately weaken support from
Israel's main diplomatic ally and arms provider.

After Netanyahu's speech, Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for
the White House National Security Council, dismissed the
purported slur, denying that it reflected how the Obama
administration felt about the Israeli leader.

'Certainly that's not the administration's view, and we
think such comments are inappropriate and counterproductive.'

The same word – 'counterproductive – was on White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's crib sheet during a Wednesday briefing with reporters.

'Those comments do not reflect the United States' position, and they do not reflect the personal views of the President of the United States,' Earnest said.

'I am not aware of who made those comments .... I am not aware if the president knows who made those comments. I'd be surprised if he did.' 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the president doesn't know who called the Israeli prime minister a vulgar name, but that it was 'counterproductive'

Confronted with harsh criticism from John Boehner, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Earnest called it 'a little rich to have a lecture about profanity from the Speaker of the House.'

Referring to the epithet 'chicken***t,' he claimed that Boehner has 'reportedly said that about the majority leader of the United States Senate,' Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada.

The speaker had hours earlier called it a 'failure' of Obama's leadership that 'disrespectful rhetoric' has been 'used time and again by this administration with respect to the special relationship the United States has with the state of Israel.'

'When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America’s friend and who he thinks is America’s enemy,' Boehner said in a statement. 'The House of Representatives has no trouble drawing that distinction.'

'Over the last several months, I have watched the administration insult ally after ally. I am tired of the administration’s apology tour. The president sets the tone for his administration. He either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration, or he does not.' 

Boehner's statement referred specifically to the use of vulgar language as a slam against a head of state, not the use of foul language in general.

Some Israeli pundits predict an Israeli election in 2015,
two years early, speculation seemingly supported by increasingly
vocal challenges to his policies from senior ministers to the
left and right of him within the coalition government.

Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, whose ultranationalist
Jewish Home party belongs to the coalition but who has had testy
relations with Netanyahu, defended him on Wednesday.

'The prime minister of Israel is not a private person. He is
the leader of the Jewish state and the entire Jewish people.
Cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult
not just to him but to the millions of Israeli citizens and Jews
across the globe,' he wrote on Faceboook. 

Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog sounded a more
critical note, telling Channel Two television: 'Netanyahu is
acting like a political pyromaniac, and he has brought our
relations with the United States to an unprecedented low.'

In a series of recent speeches widely seen in Israel as
setting the stage for a possible poll, Netanyahu has highlighted
growing security concerns in the wake of the July-August war
with Hamas in Gaza and regional unrest that has brought Islamist
militants to Israel's northern border with Syria.

Israel also worries that U.S.-led world powers will agree to
what it deems insufficient curbs on the nuclear programme of its
arch-foe, Iran, in talks with a looming Nov 24 deadline.

Fears of a possible new Palestinian Intifada, or uprising,
have been stoked in Israel by now-daily rock-throwing by
Palestinians in Jerusalem amid Muslim fears of an end to an
Israeli de facto ban on Jewish worship at the al-Aqsa mosque
compound in the holy city where Biblical temples once stood.

Netanyahu has pledged to preserve the 'status quo' at the
site, a commitment Palestinian leaders view with suspicion.

But drawing Palestinian outrage and a State Department
accusation that Israel was distancing peace, Netanyahu pledged
on Monday to fast-track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.

Netanyahu described such criticism as being 'detached from
reality', saying Jews had a right to live anywhere in Jerusalem,
regarded by Israel as its united capital - a claim not
internationally recognised.

Baskey, the U.S. spokesman, acknowledged longstanding policy
differences between Israel and Washington over settlements.  
'Obviously, despite the extremely close relationship between the
U.S. and Israel, we do not agree on every issue,' he said.

'For instance we have repeatedly made clear the United
States' longstanding view that settlement activity is
illegitimate and complicates efforts to achieve a two-state
solution.' Despite these differences 'the U.S.-Israel
relationship remains as strong as ever', Baskey added.

Most countries and the World Court deem the settlements
Israel has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal.
Israel disputes this, and has settled 500,000 Jews in East
Jerusalem and the West Bank, among 2.4 million Palestinians.
