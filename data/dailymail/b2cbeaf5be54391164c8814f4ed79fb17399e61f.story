A Michigan man will now stand trial for multiple charges, including first-degree murder, for a home invasion, shooting and robbery occurred three years ago, after police linked him to the crime using a social media post and incremental evidence.

Robert Hauser, 47, a Iosco Township landscaper who was known in the area for carrying large sums of cash, was shot to death in the basement of his secluded country home on New Years Eve 2011.

Investigators allege that Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, posted on Facebook about one month after the murder saying: 'What to do?? ... 30K I have to spend.'

Although there is no conclusive evidence putting Duke at the crime scene, police believe they have now collected enough through testimony to try him.

Duke has been booked with first-degree murder, home invasion and related felony firearm charges.

To stand trial: Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, has been charged with a long-unsolved Michigan murder after police collected a dossier of incremental evidence - including a social media post - against him

Livingston County District Judge Carol Sue Reader said the case was built on inferences and circumstantial evidence, including the Facebook post, The Livingston Daily reported.

Part of the evidence were two bullet sabots - devices used to fire bullets that are smaller than the weapon they are being shot from - that were found at Hauser's home.

A ballistic expert testified they were two halves of one sabot that was 'fired from the same barrel' of a Mossberg shotgun — the same type of rifle witnesses said Duke used for hunting practice the November before the murder, The Livingston Daily reported.

Detective Mark Klein of the Livingston County Sheriff's Department said they found similar sabots at Duke's home and at the home of his father, James Duke.

James Duke told police his adopted son had regularly been using his 12-gauge Mossberg and was an excellent shot.

Police used the sabots to allege Hauser was in the basement of his home at the time he was shot, but that Anthony Duke was outside when he pulled the trigger.

Victim: Robert Hauser, 47, a tree-clipper who lived alone on a secluded Iosco Township property, was shot dead on New Years Eve 2011

Scene: The murder occurred here at Hauser's remote Iosco Township house. Police allege Duke shot the victim from outside while he was standing in the basement

Duke allegedly lied to police about his whereabouts on the night of the murder, saying he was with his then-girlfriend, Ashley Coselman.

However Coselman told detectives Duke was not with her the entire time, and that he left for the period between 9pm and 10pm.

Investigators allege Hauser was killed at 9.26pm because it was the time frozen on his watch, which they believe broke as he fell down from his wounds.

Coselman also testified that, after the murder, Duke asked her to purchase a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun on his behalf in order 'to hand it over to Livingston County Sheriff's Department'.

In Duke's truck, police say they found a manual on how to beat a polygraph test.

They allege they found internet searches about polygraph tests on Coselman's computer as well.

Coselman also said her and Duke would argue about money, but he would come up with cash when they needed it.

Remote: Hauser's home was secluded on 11000 block of Roberts Road, near Farmer John's Lane

Investigators say that while Hauser's home had not been ransacked, there was an empty zip-lock baggie found on his dryer.

Friends told police that Hauser would always carry the baggie, and was known to carry as much as $5,000 cash in it.

The fact it was empty suggested cash had been stolen.

However Duke's defense attorney, Rolland Sizemore, said police were scrambling.

'It really looks like they're stretching to make these counts stick to Mr. Duke,' the defense attorney said.

Sizemore noted the lack of evidence, and said it was not possible for Duke to shoot Hauser from outside the home on the angle police have alleged.

Sizemore also said the empty baggie cannot prove anything was stolen.

No new court dates have been set.
