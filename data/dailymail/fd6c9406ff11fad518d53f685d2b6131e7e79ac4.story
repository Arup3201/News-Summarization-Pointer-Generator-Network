Olympic diver Tom Daley was involved in a dramatic mid-air emergency yesterday after his plane was forced to land in Siberia with a 'technical fault'.

He
 and his partner Dustin Lance Black were among 301 people aboard a 
Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 which had to put down in the Russian city 
of Irkutsk, on a flight from Shanghai to London.

Daley,
 who was returning after competing in the world diving championships in 
Shanghai, wrote on Instagram: 'Just had to make an emergency landing in 
Irkutsk, Russia on the way back from Shanghai. Here’s the pic of the 
fuel dump before landing.'

Safety and security is always our top priority.

Disappointing: It was a disappointing trip for Daley who narrowly missed out on a podium position at the diving World Cup in Shanghai, after he slipped up midway through his sequence of dives in the men's individual 10m platform

It was a disappointing trip for Daley who narrowly missed out on a podium position at the diving World Cup in Shanghai, after he slipped up midway through his sequence of dives in the men's individual 10m platform.

He had looked on course to challenge for a medal but handed the bronze position to Mexico's Ivan Garcia when he missed the front four-and-a-half somersaults tucked on his third dive.

They were beaten by China's Yang Jian and Qiu Bo, who took gold and silver respectively.
