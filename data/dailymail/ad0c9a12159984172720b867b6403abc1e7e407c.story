A touching photo from Crimson Tide quarterback turned Cincinnati Bengal AJ McCarron's wedding released Tuesday features, not his new wife, but one of their flower girls.

Starla Chapman, 5, beams into the camera in the arms of the Heisman runner-up, who famously bonded with the little girl two years ago as she battled deadly leukemia.

The photo was the first professional shot from inside his wedding to former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb.

Uncommon bond: The first professional wedding photo to come out of AJ McCarron's marriage to Katherine Webb featured the quarterback posing with his 5-year-old cancer survivor flower girl Starla Chapman

AL.com first spotted the shot when it was posted on Starla's Facebook support page.

'Starla is our little miracle not only because of the leukemia diagnosis but also because of overcoming the heart condition that should have taken her life,' the brave little girl's mother DeAndra Chapman wrote in the caption.

Starla and AJ McCarron first crossed paths in 2011 when Starla was first diagnosed with a rare childhood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia.

Their unlikely bond grew closer after Starla went into cardiac arrest in January 2012 due to the chemotherapy.

'They met and just had a connection we just can't explain,' McCarron's mom Dee Dee Bonner told MSNBC in 2012. 'He loves her to death and she loves him.'

Starla was treated like a princess at McCarron's Orange Beach, Alabama nuptials, where she wore a white 'Cinderella-style dress.'

'The entire McCarron and Webb family treated us just like family,' Starla's mother told AL.com. 'It was just an amazing experience.'

Starla is now in remission and will soon start kindergarten.

'Starla is our little miracle not only because of the leukemia diagnosis but also because of overcoming the heart condition that should have taken her life,' said Ms. Chapman.

'Ready for tomorrow!' Katherine shared a snap of her wedding rings to Instagram on Friday, showing off her diamond-heavy band and his unique black ring

Webb has shared some pictures of the glamorous event, such as this shot with her caterers, but Starla's was the first true, professional wedding shot
