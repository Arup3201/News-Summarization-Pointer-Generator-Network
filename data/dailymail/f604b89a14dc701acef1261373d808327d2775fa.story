Britain's biggest bosses scooped an average pay package of £4.8million last year while the rest of the country struggled to make ends meet, a report revealed yesterday.

The average chief executive in the FTSE 100 index of the country’s largest private sector firms got an inflation-busting pay package increase of 12 per cent.

By comparison their employees got a paltry 1 per cent, which is far below the rate at which their household bills are rising.

High earner: Sir Martin Sorrell was the second-highest paid FTSE 100 boss, the survey found

Bumper deal: Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond was the highest-paid boss, taking home £20.97million

The eye-watering payouts – equal to just over £13,000 per day – triggered outrage among MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

Witness Daniel Stilitz, a QC and trustee of the High Pay Centre, told MPs pay excess has reached absurd levels.

He compared modern boardroom culture 
to ‘the football manager who takes the credit when he wins and blames 
the referee when he loses’.

Rising trend: Average pay deals for FTSE bosses have risen from about £1million to almost £5million since 1998

The report, from shareholder advisory 
service Manifest and pay consultants MM&K, said the average FTSE 100
chief executive earns 139 times more than their average employee.

While their pay packages have jumped 
from an average of £1million in 1998 to £4.8million today, staff average
pay has risen far more modestly from £21,540 to £34,407.

Manifest warns that, ‘more 
disturbingly’, about one in four FTSE 100 bosses got a pay package 
increase of ‘41 per cent or more’ last year.

When measured in terms of total 
realisable remuneration – including salary, bonuses, pensions and share 
options – the biggest winner over the past year was Barclays chief 
executive Bob Diamond.

His £20.97million potential pay 
package dwarfs that of the second placed executive on the list, WPP 
chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. His £11.62million maximum package at
the advertising group represented a 60 per cent increase on the 
previous year.

He is expected to face a shareholder rebellion today.

Next is David Brennan, on a potential 
£11.32million, who announced his retirement from pharmaceutical company 
AstraZeneca earlier this year.

He is followed by Sir Andrew Witty, on up to £10.75million as chief executive at fellow pharma group GlaxoSmithKline.

Fifth on the list is Marius Kloppers 
on a maximum £9.82million at the world’s biggest mining company, BHP 
Billiton. Meanwhile, business lobby group the CBI has warned pay freezes
or paltry pay rises far below the rate of inflation are ‘the new 
normal’ for workers.

Retiring: AstraZeneca boss David Brennan was the third-highest earner on the list

During yesterday’s Treasury Select 
Committee hearing one Tory MP Jesse Norman questioned why senior 
executives are paid so much compared to other professions.

He said: ‘These people are being paid an enormous amount of money...for no skill at all.’

Last night shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said excess pay and rewards are ‘bad for our economy and bad for business.’

He said: ‘We need to strengthen and empower shareholders so that they can clamp down in cases where there are excessive awards.’
