Who would live in a house like this? Someone very very small!

The tiny intricate worlds and shrunken people that make up these latest trend in art are so detailed you can almost picture yourself in them.

Using everyday objects like Tupperware boxes, tea cups, thimbles, a footprint in the snow and even  finger nails as their canvas, artists from around the world have created unbelievably tiny scenes.

From an itsy-bitsy farm in a Tupperware 
box to a teeny unlucky crushed man in a snow footprint and a microscopic
family enjoying a picnic on a woman's nails, the patience and skill 
needed to make these worlds is incredible.

This mini house is hand made out of paper clay and nestled in a garden of real moss and constructed within a thimble

This teeny family enjoy a picnic, on artist Alice Bartlett's nails, which are coated in a grass-like covering

Artist Yuri Yamamoto shows off his skill by transferring part of his miniscule farm scene, complete with farmer, cows, pigs and chickens, to a spoon

There is certainly black humour in this piece as an unlucky mini-man has been crushed by a walking giant

One of the artists Slinkachu has developed an entire project around the concept of tiny scenes set in urban streets.

Entitled the 'Little People Project', it has been going since 2006, and the anonymous 32 year-old male artist behind Slinkachu has set up hundreds of scenes around the world.

He says of the project: 'One day, while working outside, i started to imagine how much fun it would be hide miniature people in the square around me.

'Over time I have become a lot more 
interested in how people react to the images and how people empathised 
with the characters and the stories in the photography.

'Each scene involves the remodelling and painting of miniature model train set characters, which I then place, photograph and leave on the street.

'It is both a street art installation project and a photography project.

'The street-based side of my work plays with the notion of surprise and I aim to encourage city-dwellers to be more aware of their surroundings.

'All the figures are stuck down using super glue and are left in situ on the streets.

'Each scene probably takes me a five or six hours in total to complete, from the idea stage to making of the figures, which I individually customise.'

A creme brulee serves as the scene of a devastating fire that these mini fireman are dutifully extinguishing in this piece by Minimiam, who uses desserts as a canvas for their art

The great escape gets shrunk down in this scene in which many tiny people are pictured on each others shoulders in an attempt to reach freedom

This tiny beach scene sees mini beach goers enjoying the sand and sea, complete with a tiny umbrella and beach chairs

Other artists like Yuri Yamamoto create a diverse range of art, of which the tiny Tupperware creations are just one aspect.

Canadian Nichola Battilana, who runs Pixie Hill Studio, makes a range of thimble worlds under her 'Faery and Pixie' section, aiming to create a mystical world which ignites the imagination.

The tiny house is hand sculpted with paperclay and the moss and are natural, and painstaking positioned into the thimble.

These tiny climbers brave the mountains of meringues, with one of them tumbling down a sweet but treacherous piste in this piece by Minimian

A paradise made for two... on top of a tennis ball, as the bathing suit clad couple survey the scenery

In a more socially conscious piece, this miniature scene depicts a young boy standing in a mine field, surrounded by danger signs

This miniature pin cushion is small enough to sit in a tea cup and features a tiny house and front garden

You can almost hear the laughter from this tiny playground, where a child is actually posed half way down the slide, while others play play on the swings

Tranquility oozes from this scene where a tiny man sits reading his book atop a stack of normal books

The bird feathers in this smile-inducing scene emphasise the small size of the incredibly detailed models

The imagination goes wild when we glimpse inside this tiny doorway at the side of a fireplace and see a miniscule set of stairs inside sweeping up, in this scene as part of the 'Urban Fairies' project

This shop doorway is adjacent to the tiny, but perfectly match 'fairy' doorway which sits nestled in the side of the shop with a tiny wicket basket by the door
