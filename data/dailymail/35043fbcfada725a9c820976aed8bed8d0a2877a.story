A tiny paper-thin sensor can be 'tattooed' onto teeth - and works as an ultra-sensitive 'early warning system' for disease.

The sensor, created from graphene, a hi-tech one-atom-thick sheet of carbon can detect bacteria, and transmit information to medical staff.

In tests, a student breathed onto the sensor - actually implanted on a cow's tooth - and it picked up molecules of bacteria on his breath.

A team of scientists at Princeton University have developed a 'tooth tattoo', which can pick up early warning signs of sickness or infection by bacteria in people's breath

The wireless sensor can be tattooed onto teeth, diagnose an infection and transmit that information to medical professionals

Michael McAlpine and his team at Princeton University started with graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon.

Michael McAlpine and his team at Princeton believe the sensors could be used for military personnel in the field to determine whether a wound has become infected, or in hospitals where patients with weakened immune systems are extra vulnerable to bacteria.

Mr McAlpine said: e experimented with a cow's tooth and when a student breathes onto the sensor planted on it, the computer picked up molecules on his breath.

The scientists created the remote chemical sensor with graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon, which is very sticky and has a super-sensitive surface. They then planted carefully constructed peptides (a sequence of amino acids) onto the surface of graphene. McAlpine and his team have shown the sensors can detect bacteria individually picking them up like Velcro.  McAlpine is currently planning to license and commercialise the device.
