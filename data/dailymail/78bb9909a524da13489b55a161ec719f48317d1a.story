The world's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a Neanderthal who lived around 130,000 years ago. 

Scientists at the University of Kansas took X-rays of the inch-long rib fragments - first found in the Krapina rock shelters of Croatia - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing.

Following CT scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft-tissue tumour known in modern-day patients as fibrous dysplasia.

Scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This condition is called fibrous dysplasia

Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue.

It can cause abnormal growth or 
swelling of the bone.

Although it can occur in any part of the 
skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper 
arm and pelvis

Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure.

The disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood.

Males and females of any race are equally affected.

The bones studied by Kansas university anthropologist David Frayer and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in Croatia.

The site, known as the Krapina rock shelter, in the north of the country held more than 900 Neanderthal bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago.

Frayer wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died.

Many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in Croatia had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks. This scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in Pennsylvania has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had 'eaten away' the bone

The detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been 'eaten away'

These marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals. 

Researchers
from the University of Pennsylvania took X-rays of the bones during the
1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs.

One of the inch-long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were 'burned out' in the X-ray images.

'Burned out' sections of X-rays suggest over exposure, and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment. 

Frayer used these images as a guide to take new, higher-resolution X-rays of the specimens.

His team also scanned the bones using high-resolution microCT scanners that doctors currently use on modern-day patients. 

The microCT scan found that the 'spongy bone' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. 

This type of tumour is seen in modern-day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia.

Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue.

It can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton, it is most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper arm and pelvis

Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure.

Frayer reported the findings in the journal PLOS ONE.

He told LiveScience: 'People
of that time didn't live as long as they did today; plus, there weren't
very many of them compared to the Egyptians and people today.

'Finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers, is -
I don't know if I want to say "lucky" - but there isn't a lot of 
evidence for it.'

It was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up, but now experts believe the rocky African landscape played a far more significant role

Describing the type of tumour that was found, Frayer added: 'They range all the way from being totally benign, where you wouldn’t 
recognize them, to being extremely painful.

'The size 
of this one, and the bulging of it, probably caused the individual 
pain.'

Previously the earliest known tumours were found in Egyptian mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly.

A study released earlier this month discovered that Neanderthals lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt.

The
results showed that 
modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and Neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated.

Neanderthals had larger eyes than Homo sapiens but did not develop brain power in the same way. This meant that Homo sapiens were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive Neanderthals who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs

Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research.

Chemical
analysis of a neanderthal child's tooth reveal it was reared on 
mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same 
period coupled with solid food.

The
change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by 
looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar 
compound to calcium -  in teeth enamel.

This
enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 
year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago.

The
brains of Neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but 
more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger 
bodies.

Researchers from the University of York additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change.

The study found that our upright gait may
have its origins in the rugged landscape of East and South Africa which
was shaped during the Pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic
plates.

Hominins, human's early ancestors, would 
have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because 
it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey.

But it also required 
more upright scrambling and climbing gaits, prompting the emergence of 
bipedalism.
