A teenager today spoke of how her life had been ‘ruined’ after she was targeted by a random man on Facebook during a terrifying stalking obsession that culminated in him sending her a hoax bomb.

Chloe Edgley, 19, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, was chosen at random by stranger John Michael Conner, who first made contact by leaving a comment on a picture of her on the networking website.

Conner, 46, of Eastbourne, Sussex, stalked Chloe, then 17, for months by sending her mysterious packages including a puzzle and watch to her workplace - the £170-a-night Queen’s Hotel in Leeds.

But events took a terrifying turn in October 2011 when he sent her a hoax bomb - intercepted by police, who found it was a bottle of perfume wrapped in gaffer tape and attached to battery wires.

The same day a sickening letter arrived at the 215-room, four-star city centre hotel claiming to detail what Miss Edgley’s family would be entitled to in the event of her death.

The girl had also received a book from her stalker who wrote a message inside about their connection through numbers and described the relationship the pair would have.

She said: ‘It suddenly hit me that someone wanted me dead, someone hated me that much that they wanted to kill me. I was thinking “I’m only 17, what have I done that means that?”’

Miss Edgley, who also received chilling 3am calls from a man pertaining to be a work colleague asking her to meet him, added: ‘I was signed off work for six weeks. I was stressed, I was paranoid.

‘I couldn’t trust anybody – at one point I even accused my boyfriend. Everyone was a suspect. People commented on how much I had changed, how different I was.

‘I was so paranoid I wouldn’t speak to anyone, I wouldn’t go out. I’d been bubbly, chatty and friendly. I wouldn’t even speak to my mum.’

Police only managed to snare Conner when her boyfriend reported a suspicious comment made by him on her Facebook page to the police, after she had dismissed it.

On her 18th birthday Conner pleaded 
guilty to harassment and making a hoax bomb and in April 2012 he was 
sentenced to 36 weeks in prison.

'This complete stranger ruined my life. He made my life hell. Even now I can’t sleep in my own bed - I have to sleep downstairs'

Miss Edgley, who is now expecting her first child, has now returned to work and is trying to get back into a normal routine.

She said: ‘This complete stranger ruined my life. He made my life hell. Even now I can’t sleep in my own bed - I have to sleep downstairs.’

West Yorkshire Police Detective Chief Insp Sue Jenkinson said: ‘Harassment and stalking are crimes that can have a devastating impact on victims. Nationally around one in five women and one in 10 men will be stalked at some point in their lives.

‘We want everyone affected by stalking to know that there is help available and that they are not alone. Stalking is illegal and no one should endure it.’
