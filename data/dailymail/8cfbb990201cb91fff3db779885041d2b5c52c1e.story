Iconic album covers from the past 50 years have been given an unusual makeover that is taking the internet by storm.

The series of cat cover versions blend rock 'n' roll with the web's favourite topic - kittens.

Hundreds of thousands of people have seen the clever images, originally created by Alfra Martini who founded The Kitten Covers.

Purr-fect: The kitten recreates the famous Nirvana Nevermind cover of a baby reaching out to a dollar bill tied to a piece of string underwater

Cat-titude: The iconic cover to The Strokes album Is This It is given a different tone in the kitty makeover

Furry good: A fluffy white kitten, surrounded by monochrome cats, takes the place of Debbie Harry in the recreation of Blondie's Parallel Lines cover

The claws are out: A tiny kitten prepares to smash a guitar on stage in the cat version of The Clash's memorable London Calling cover

Since the website was launched in 2011, scores of rock and pop albums have been parodied.

In
some of the best recreations, a kitten replaces a baby chasing a dollar
for Nirvana's Nevermind and a fluffy white cat stands in for Debbie 
Harry in the artwork for Blondie's Parallel Minds.

Other iconic figures that have been given the cat treatment include Michael Jackson and Bob Marley.

Musical
stars John Travolta and Oliver Newton-John are also usurped by loved-up
kittens in one cover version, while dancing cats mimic the poses of 
Mick Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks on the cover of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.

Copy cat: Dancing felines mimic the poses of Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks in the cover artwork for Rumours

Cat-erwaul: A manic looking cat replaces a skeleton in the recreation of Iron Maiden's famous album cover

Musical moggies: John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are replaced by a pair of cute kittens in the Grease cover

Prrrrrism: Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon is given an unusual make over

Even heavy metal bands are not immune.

Cats have even been made to look like make-up clad rockers Kiss in one cover.

In another cover version, a cute 
kitten is pictured ready to smash an electric guitar on stage in a 
parody of the world-famous picture on The Clash's London Calling.

Unnerving Iron Maiden artwork that features a screaming skull is made only slightly more palatable by being replaced by a flaming cat.

However, some are less convincing than others.

A very wet cat does not bear much resemblance to the soul legend Marvin Gaye in the version of What's Going On.

Feline good: The ginger cat perfectly mimics the relaxed pose of Bob Marley in the picture for the best of album

Definitely Off The Wall: A cat in a bow tie substitutes for Michael Jackson in the class album cover

What IS going on? An unhappy looking cat does not have much resemblance to Marvin Gaye

Cats that got the cream: Four felines complete with make up replace glam rock band Kiss
