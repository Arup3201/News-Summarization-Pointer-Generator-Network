It has been an unfathomably rough summer for the children of the late Mary Richardson Kennedy, who tragically hanged herself this past spring.

But country singer Taylor Swift has no doubt been helping young Conor Kennedy cope this summer, and has been pictured frequently with him around the family’s Cape Cod estate.

On Sunday, the 22-year-old Grammy winner accompanied her boyfriend and eldest son of RFK Jr. along with his other siblings, on a sombre visit to his mother’s grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery.

The New York Daily News, which obtained exclusive pictures of the visit, reported that Swift and Kennedy walked hand-in-hand to the Hyannis, Massachusetts cemetery.

Exclusive video by ET shows that the couple rarely let go of each others' hands.

Connor was wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts, with Swift looking summery in a red floral print A-line dress, Ray Ban sunglasses, and leather shoes.

The couple, who was seen caressing just a day before, appeared solemn at his mother’s grave, and at one point appeared to bow their heads in prayer, as did Kennedy’s siblings.

According to the Daily News, Kennedy also reached down to clear some brambles and overgrown grass from his mother’s yet-unmarked grave.

Mary Kennedy, 52, hanged herself on May 16 in a barn behind the couple’s home in Bedford, New York, amid bitter divorce proceedings and a battle with depression and addiction.

Swift, who is said to be worth as much as $80million, reportedly purchased a $5million Cape Cod mansion next to the Kennedy’s sprawling estate. 

Before the sombre visit, the young couple attended mass together.

The day before, Kennedy took the country darling to the wedding of his cousin Kyle Kennedy.

The two have been sighted around Cape Cod and Nantucket throughout the summer, walking hand-in-hand on the Cape’s pristine beaches, and even stealing a kiss or two on the docks.
