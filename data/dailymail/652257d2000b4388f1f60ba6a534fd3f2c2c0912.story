Atletico Madrid assistant coach German Burgos became the first person to use a Google Glass application to help his team to victory on Sunday night.

Burgos took to the dugout at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez wearing a pair of the innovative glasses which Google have developed alongside the the Liga de Futbol Profesional (LFP) to allow coaches to receive live statistics from the match.

New era? German Burgos wears Google Glass during Atletico Madrid's match against Getafe

The view: Burgos could watch the game while keeping an eye on important match statistics

The new technology meant the Atleti 
coach could keep up with 'general statistics', 'game buliding', 
'defence' and 'shots' all while watching their side cruise to a 2-0 win.

A statement from LFP said: 'The product allows the analysis of games in real time and the extraction of data from each game; clubs will have all the information about their own game, and of the sides they will face throughout the season.

'It will be the first time that Google Glass integrates such a useful footballing service.'

In Germany, Google Glass could also soon be used by match officials, enabling them to watch action replays as if they were watching the game on the television.

Bundesliga referees could be the first to try out the new technology as referee chief Andreas Rettig discussed last year.

He told German newspaper, Sued Deustche: 'Basically, we are 
always open to new technological innovations, but it is also clear that 
we need to address the fundamental decisions more carefully.

'[We
 should think about] computer glasses for referees, such as Google 
Glass. When we think about technical progress, then we must take the 
next step to discuss whether the referee could wear glasses to see what 
everyone sees on the couch.'

Barnet manager and MailOnline columnist Martin Allen welcomed the prospect, admitting: ‘It could be the future and, when my team were 4-0 down against Halifax on Saturday, I wouldn’t have minded a bit of extra technology!

Keen: Barnet boss Martin Allen says he would be open to trying a pair of Google glasses

‘Most clubs have analysts in the stands to edit highlights and provide data for coaches and managers. You wouldn’t have imagined that 20 years ago but it is a fantastic learning tool because players can see immediately the points you are making. If Google want to give me a pair, I’d be happy to use them.’
