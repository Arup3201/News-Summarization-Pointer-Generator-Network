Donnie Sharp, 5, had many items on his to-do-list, among them riding a horse, sleeping outdoors and above all, becoming a New Orleans firefighter just like his grandpa.

On Monday, the terminally ill boy exhausted from radiation treatment was carried into a firehouse in the Algiers section of the Big Easy to be named an honorary firefighter. No one knew it was to be his final wish. 

The toddler passed away Wednesday after losing a two-year battle with neuroblastoma - a rare malignant nerve tissue cancer.

Fearless: Donnie Sharp, 5, passed away at Children's Hospital in New Orleans Wednesday following a two-year battle with Stage 4 nerve cancer

Donnie's mother, Laura Sharp, told the station WWLTV as soon as her son drew his last breath, relief was visible on his face as he passed away at Children's Hospital.

The mother of six tearfully recalled that shortly before her son's death, Donnie confided in her that he saw angels in the hospital lobby.

‘He just looked back and forth like he was looking at somebody and he said, “I see 'em. I see 'em,"’ Mrs Sharp said. 

Two days earlier, New Orleans firefighters stood at attention as Donnie, his head shaven and oxygen tubes sticking out of his nose, was sworn in as their newest colleague.

‘On behalf of the city of New Orleans and the proud men and women of the New Orleans Fire Department, I promote you to the rank of firefighter,’ Chief Tim McConnell told Donnie.

Becoming a firefighter was high on the boy’s 'Donnie's Do List.'

'He's always told us that when he grows up, he will be a fireman just like his Pop Pop,' Laura Sharp said, referring to her father, John Manning, a veteran of the NOFD.

On Monday, the plan was for Donnie to go for a ride on a ladder truck with his new friends, but he was tired from his treatment and in pain, so the firefighters promised him to take him for a spin later on, the news station reported.

So young: At age three, Donnie was diagnosed with terminal nerve cancer, which continued spreading despite chemo and radiation treatments, a bone marrow transplant and immonotherapy

At age three, Donnie, the youngest of six children, was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma. Over the course of two years, he had gone through chemotherapy, radiation treatment, surgery, a bone marrow transplant and immunotherapy, but the cancer spread.

Last week, the family were told that there was nothing left to do for little Donne except make him comfortable in hospice care.

The boy's father, Derek Sharp, recalled one of his last conversations with the wise-beyond-his-years toddler, who shared with him a few words of wisdom: ‘All I want you to do, Daddy, is love Mommy. And I want Mommy to love you and you will be happy,'

The Sharp family's friends from church had started an online fundraiser on GoFundMe.com when Donnie was still alive to collect money towards his wish list, which included roasting marshmallows; going down a water slide; eating at a Chuck E. Cheese  restaurant and traveling to Illinois to meet with extended family.

The 5-year-old will never get to do any of these things now, but his mother says there is a silver lining to the tragedy.

‘He will never have cancer again. He is cancer free. Cured,’ said Laura. 

The online fundraiser remains active to help the Sharps with Donnie’s medical bills and final expenses. So far, people have donated more than $11,000.
