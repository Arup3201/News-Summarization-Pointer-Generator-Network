Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has received a six-match ban after getting a straight red card for a reckless challenge in the 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday.

The Dutch forward was chasing Manuel Schmiedebach when he decided to lunge with both feet into the back of the Hanover player's legs. 

Remarkably, though, Schalke appear outraged that such a dangerous action warrants a lengthy ban.

'A six-game ban for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar,' the club said on their Twitter account on Monday. 'Schalke does not accept the sanction.'

It was not immediately clear whether the Bundesliga outfit had already appealed against the decision by the German Football Association (DFB).

Schalke, who face Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16 this month, are fourth in the Bundesliga and visit leaders Bayern Munich on Tuesday.

Dutch international Huntelaar, 31, who has played in 17 of the 18 league games this season, has scored seven times.

Schmeidebach tumbles to the floor and Huntelaar is sent off moments later 

But Schalke took to Twitter to announce that they do not accept the ban that was given to him
