What started out as an expose into the lives of neo-Nazis has turned into a documentary of how a California man was shot by his 10-year-old son.

In the months leading up to his murder Jeff Hall, a leader of the National Socialist Movement, was being filmed by Julie Platner.

But before the New York video journalist could complete her work, Hall had been killed by his own child, leaving many unanswered questions.

Questions: Jeff Hall was being filmed for a documentary about neo-Nazism when he was killed by his 10-year-old son

After his untimely death, Platner began working with 60 Minutes, as they combined the rare footage she had of the Hall family with an investigation into his death.

For more than a year Platner followed Hall and his family, building up trust to gain unprecedented access to the controversial organization he was part of.

She had observed the group's meetings where members yelled Sieg Heil and read from Mein Kampf, watched the men fight with those who confronted them about their beliefs, and filmed as Hall cradled his baby daughter.

'I was really wanting to really confront
 him for the first time and ask him what is he doing and why is he doing
 this? But that never happened,' she told CBS News.

Dedication: Platner worked hard to gain the trust of the Hall family so she could document the neo-Nazi movement

The video journalist had become a regular fixture in the family home which she said, were it not for obvious signs of Hall's dark beliefs, felt at times like any other house.

'They have a swastika hanging from their living room. I mean, you know, it doesn't get much darker than that,' she said, adding that Hall appeared to care deeply for his children.

Family life regularly overlapped with 
their neo-Nazi beliefs. Platner watched as group meetings took place in 
the back yard, and took photos as a man in a T-shirt emblazoned with a 
swastika cooked barbecue food during a baby shower.

Platner had been due to interview Hall on the day of his death. His son, Joseph, was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to ten years in juvenile prison.

Joseph, who is now 13, claimed that he shot Hall because he didn't want to have to chose which parent to live with if his father divorced his stepmother, Time reported.

A documentary about the killing, which includes Platner's footage, was broadcast on CBS on Sunday.
