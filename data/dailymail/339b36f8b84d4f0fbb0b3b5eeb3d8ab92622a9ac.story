Aside from spotting the odd dirty pigeon, living in the city is far from an ornithologist's dream.

But town-dwelling nature lovers can now bring a touch of the countryside to their homes thanks to an new rooftop box bird box.

Designer Klaas Kuiken, 28, made the box from terracotta clay so that it blends into a regular tile when it goes on the tiles of a house.

Ornithologist's dream: Klaas Kuiken's tile bird house is made from terracotta so that it blends in with city dweller's roofs

It may not look like the most comfortable nesting spot for a bird, but hidden underneath the tile is a cosy basket that is strong enough to stop the bird getting through into the roof.

Mr Kuikenwas inspired to create his innovative bird box to encourage more birds into urban areas after reading that sparrow numbers were steadily decreasing.

Although originally designed for sparrows, other birds have been known to use the boxes since bird lovers started snapping up the special tiles.

The bird box is attached to the tile using strong glue which is tough enough to resist extreme temperatures and strong winds.

Mr Kuiken, from Sneek, in Holland, said: 'I spent some time trying to figure out a solution to this problem.

'After a little bit of research I discovered the sparrow often finds it difficult to find a nesting spot.

'This is because its old favourite spot tucked in under roof tiles does not exist much anymore because of new building regulations.'

The 8in tall bird box roof tiles have proved popular in Holland and are available across the world by ordering online.

The bird box only comes with one type of roof tile at the moment, but Mr Kuiken is busy working on different designs.

The boxes should only be put up on the north or east of the house to ensure they are not in direct sunlight.

But Mr Kuiken says that heat from the sun shouldn't have any damaging effect on the birds.

He said: 'Since I invented this I have heard a few people say you will end up with boiled eggs because of the sun.

'But this is the place the sparrows used to use as nesting spot and that's why it's such a good spot. It makes total sense.

'You have to be careful with the placement of the box. For example it has to be on the north or east side of the house so it will be out of the sun and not heat up too much.

'Having said that birds know exactly where to find a good spot to nest and if they think it it will be too warm, they will not go in. It is as simple as that.'

The tiles cost just under Â£100.
