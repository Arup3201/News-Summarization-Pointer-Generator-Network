Slowly but surely, this is the moment that brave cerebal palsy sufferer Imogen Kelly took her first steps.

The four-year-old was unable to unaided walk  before she underwent a life-changing operation which will hopefully see her able to walk by herself.

Little Imogen was one of just 120 youngsters aged between three and nine chosen for the procedure as part of a pioneering NHS trial.

The Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy involved surgeons snipping damaged nerves in her spine.

Just weeks after the operation, Imogen has started getting around with the support of crutches and has delighted her family and doctors with her strong progress.

Her mother Sarah Rogers, 24, said the operation has already proved life-changing and is like a dream come true.

Imogen can now wear normal shoes for the first time and has come off painkillers and muscle-relaxing drugs.

A £30,000 fund originally collected by generous locals for the Imogen's Wish appeal to fund the surgery privately is now being used to pay for the intense physiotherapy she will need to give her the best chance of thriving. 

Imogen was born prematurely and the cerebral palsy affects the left side of her body.

She could previously take steps with the help of a walker, but her family wanted to give her every opportunity to live a full life and walk completely unaided.

Mrs Kelly, of Horden, Co Durham, said: 'She's a little star. The difference in her is amazing, just after a matter weeks.

'At the minute she describes her legs as being new and like jelly but is working hard at physio to build up the muscle to prepare her for independent walking.

'She can now also wear shoes that fit her feet, instantly becoming flat after surgery and this is a first for Imogen and she is so pleased.'

Imogen was chosen to undergo the operation after passing a series of tests.

The NHS had said it was putting a halt to carrying out the procedure on a routine basis last year, before then agreeing to run a trial. 

Imogen's family had already started to raise cash so it could be done privately, with the funds now freed to support her recovery. 

Sarah added: 'She herself wants to thank everyone who's helped raise funds and helped her to reach her dream.

'The future is very bright for Imogen and we all as a family feel very grateful and blessed for the opportunity she has been given.

'With extensive physiotherapy she will reach her goal.'
