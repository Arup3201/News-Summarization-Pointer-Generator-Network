Government officials made an embarrassing blunder by referring to the Falklands Islands as 'Malvinas' - the name given to them by the Argentinians.

The Home Office was pulled into line by the Foreign Office after it was caught using the controversial name when sending a purchase order to the islands' capital Stanley.

The mistake - which has been made by the Government before - meant the address said: 'Falkland Island Government, The Treasury, Stanley, 
Falkland Islands (Malvinas).'

Home Office officials sent a purchase order to the Falkland Islands, pictured, calling them by their Argentinian name 'Malvinas' - something which goes against the Government's own policy

The use of the term 'Malvinas' is an embarrassment because it goes against the Government's policy of always calling them the Falkland Islands.

The use of the Spanish name is also a snub to 
islanders - and Britain itself - because it could imply that the islands belong to 
Argentina. something which has been in dispute for decades.

But it is not the first time that Government officials have made the gaffe.

The islands' government was forced to complain after it received an order addressed 
to the 'Malvinas' in June 2013.

This week, Labour MP Tommy Docherty - who has previously brought up the issue in Parliament -, tabled a question to foreign secretary 
William Hague to ask why the blunder kept happening.

According to official Parliament records, Mr Docherty asked whether the secretary of state would 'discuss the correct
 use of the name Falkland Islands with the Secretary of State for the 
Home Office'.

Foreign Office minister Hugo 
Swire told Mr Docherty that Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 
officials had been in contact with the Home Office to 'remind them of 
the appropriate terminology for the Falkland Islands'.

He said: 'All Government 
departments and agencies should refer to ‘the Falkland Islands’ in all 
instances.

Foreign secretary William Hague was asked why the blunders had been made. The Foreign Office said there was 'no ambiguity' on what the Falkland Islands should be called

'There is no evidence that incorrect terminology has been used
 other than in the isolated cases.'

Mr Docherty had also asked Mr Hague in March what discussions he had led 'on the correct use of the name of the Falkland 
Islands by Government departments', records show.

Mr Swire again reported at that time that officials had been 'in contact' with the offending department to remind them of the 
appropriate terminology.

He said: 'No specific 
cross-governmental guidance has been issued on this matter, but it is 
clear that all Government departments and agencies should use the 
correct name, which is of course the Falkland Islands.'

On a previous occasion, he had said:  'There is no
 ambiguity on this point. All Government Departments and Agencies should
 refer to the Islands by their correct name, which is the Falkland 
Islands.'

The dispute over the islands blew up into a full-scale war after Argentina
 invaded the Falklands on April 2 1982.

The ensuing war lasted for 74 days, claiming the lives of 255 British military
 personnel, 649 Argentinians and three Falkland Islanders.

In 
referendum in March 2013, which produced a 92 per cent turn out, 1,513 
islanders vote to retain their status as British overseas territory, 
with just three voting against.
