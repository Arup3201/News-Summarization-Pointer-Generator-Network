Arsenal are ramping up their interest in Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin.

Arsene Wenger, who is in Brazil working for French TV, watched Schneiderlin in France's Group match with Ecuador and has commissioned club scouts to keep tabs on the 24-year-old.

Wenger holds a long-term interest in Schneiderlin but wants to see whether he can handle the step up in class at the World Cup.

Potential: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been keeping tabs on Morgan Schneiderlin in Brazil

Wish list: Midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in action for France in their group clash against Ecuador

Bending over backwards: Wenger is interested in Schneiderlin but Southampton are reluctant to sell

2005-2008: Strasbourg B (37 apps, 5 gls)

2006-2008: Strasbourg (5, 0)

2008-NOW: Southampton (205, 10)

Members of
 the Gunners' backroom staff believe Schneiderlin is the answer to the 
club's search for a new holding midfielder but know they will face a 
battle to lure the midfielder from Southampton.

New boss Ronaldo Koeman is ready to persuade him to stay, particularly with the pending departure of Adam Lallana to Liverpool.

Schneiderlin will be a contender to replace Lallana as new Saints captain once Lallana's exit is finalised.

Arsenal 
have been on an intense scouting drive to identify a midfield anchorman 
with Sami Khedira, Lars Bender and Javi Martinez all featuring on 
Wenger's list.
