Sergio 
Garcia is off the hook after fans find the diamond he knocked off a 
woman's engagement ring with a wild drive in the WGC-Bridgestone 
Invitational.

Garcia bagged $900,000 for finishing second behind Rory McIlroy, some 
of which might have gone to pay for the ring he broke with a wild shot 
off the third tee on Sunday.

Garcia
 was up three shots over McIlroy going into the final round at 
Firestone, when his tee shot veered off course and hit a spectator's ring finger.

CBS coverage showed Garcia gamely giving a look for the stone in the grass before leaving the woman with a 
signed ball and finishing the hole with a bogey.

As he headed away from the crowd Garcia asked to get the woman's contact information if the gem couldn't be found.

CBS commentator David Faherty remarked that, 'This could be the most expensive tee shot of all time.'

'A diamond in the rough,' he added, followed up by a few faked laughs of his own.

Another
 spectator located the diamond in the grass, but the errant drive still 
cost Garcia, as McIlroy shot a birdie on the par-four and took over at the top of the leaderboard.

The Northern Irishman held onto the lead to secure a follow-up victory to his win at the British Open last month.

McIlroy
 returns to the top of the world rankings and heads for this week’s PGA 
Championship as the bookies’ favorite - with odds as short as 9/2 at 
some firms.

Garcia is available at 20/1 as he looks to break a string of second-place finishes.
