For someone who loves to be right beside the seaside, this hut seems like the perfect investment.

But with no electricity or running water and limited furniture, £100,000 may seem a bit steep for those looking to snap up a small piece of the British coastline.

The Happy Days hut in Southwold, Suffolk, is on a promenade, adjacent to the widest part of the beach.

It is located on one of the most sought-after stretches in the area, and estate agents believe it will fetch more than its already steep asking price.

Owners are given a 30-year lease on the property from the council. They can commercially let the hut to holidaymakers on a daily or weekly basis, but cannot sleep in the huts overnight.

There is only one room in the hut which has enough space to fit four people, but the buyers can choose to put in furniture or appliances such as gas stoves and generators to make it feel more comfortable.
