Roy Hodgson believes that Danny Welbeck's £16million move to Arsenal will boost the youngster's performances for England this season.

Welbeck's chances were going to be limited at Manchester United after the recent signings of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria, so Hodgson is delighted he will be playing regular league and Champions League football.

He said: 'I think the biggest bonus is for him (Welbeck) of course. It's good for him now that he's going where he will get more playing time.

'I think Arsenal have signed a good player. And the more they play for their clubs, the better it is for me.'

Hodgson, however, has admitted he will have to get used to selecting England players who spend most of the time on the bench at their Premier League clubs.

The England manager remains relaxed about the players he has available as the nation heads into qualifying for Euro 2016.

But he concedes that many England players will now struggle to get into top flight sides after a record-breaking summer transfer window.

He said: 'It is an interesting debate, not least thanks to Greg Dyke's report.

'I am very calm about what's going on. I think we have enough players. I just have to accept, and our nation has to accept, that some of our players will be selected on benches, which was unthinkable five to 10 years ago but it is the world we live in.

'The standard in the Premier League, with some of the players being signed, we are becoming a magnet for the best players in the world. It could be advantageous for English players who become top players in their team."
