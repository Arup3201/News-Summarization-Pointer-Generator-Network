Students, listen up. You'd better enjoy living in squalor while studying for exams and eating cold baked beans straight from the tin because it's all downhill after graduation.

University days are the happiest of our lives, with the years spent missing lectures, kissing strangers and napping in the library considered more important than even the birth of your first child or getting married, according to a survey.

People, especially those over 45, consider their university days the happiest period of their lives

And it's not just the young who believe this. In fact, those aged between 
45 and 54 were most likely to value university as their most important 
life experience, with those aged between 35 and 54 most likely to think 
they will never have a period of their lives better than their 
university years.

And it is current students and the recently graduated who worry most about not having made the most of their time at university, with 73 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds wishing 
they'd had more experiences.

Over 57 per cent of all people quizzed considered their student years the best period of their lives, with three out of five people wishing they could go back to relive them.

Meeting new people and living away from home for the first time came out top as the reasons for making it so memorable.

Going to university was even ranked more important than getting married, buying your own house, getting your first job or even the 
birth of a first child.

More people considered their university days the most important time of their lives than did having their first child

Those who studied at Leeds and 
Wolverhampton are most likely to consider their university years the 
best of their life, while those from the North East were the least 
enthusiastic. The Scottish were the least 
likely to consider ever going back to university.

The research, carried out by the Chimes Shopping Centre in Uxbridge, involved offering 1,000 adults a list of 13 life experiences and asking them to select their top five. University was picked more than any other.

Donna Watson, Marketing Manager for the Chimes, said: 'With tuition fees at an all-time high many are questioning whether university really is worth it any more.

'However, with a third of those surveyed wishing they could go back to university again, it would seem that many still view it as a worthwhile life experience.'
