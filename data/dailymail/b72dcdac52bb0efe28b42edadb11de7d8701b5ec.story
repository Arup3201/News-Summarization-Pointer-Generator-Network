In crisis: The debacle has left incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, facing crisis

Members of the Church of England’s ‘parliament’ are attempting to oust one of its most senior figures following the defeat of legislation to allow women bishops. 

In a dramatic move, members of the General Synod’s House of Laity have secretly called an emergency meeting so they can hold a vote of no confidence in their Chair, Dr Philip Giddings, who spoke forcefully against the reform.

They believe that, if Dr Giddings is forced out, the move could help Church leaders get around the rules and bring back the legislation before a new Synod is elected in three years’ time.

The debacle, which was condemned by David Cameron and MPs, has sparked bitter recriminations within the Church and left incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, facing a crisis. 

Much of the anger has focused on the lay members because the legislation fell by only six votes in their section of the Synod, which is made up of three Houses: bishops, clergy and laity.

A significant number are said to be 
furious that House of Laity Chair Dr Giddings spoke out against the 
legislation rather than remaining neutral.

One
insider said: ‘Chairmen should be unifying rather than polarising 
figures, especially when there is overwhelming support for legislation.’

They added there was such a 
groundswell of frustration that a vote of no confidence could well be 
passed, which could have implications for the future of the legislation.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the incident

Dr
Giddings, 66, a leading conservative evangelical who was also a key 
opponent of the appointment of the gay cleric Jeffrey John as Bishop of 
Reading in 2003, said last night he was ‘disappointed’ that fellow Synod
members had turned against him.

A
spokesman for the Church said that, under Synod rules, a meeting of the
House had to be convened if more than a tenth of its 210 members 
demanded it and well over that number had done so.

Meanwhile, the Bristol Diocesan Synod has passed a motion of no confidence over the failure of the legislation.
