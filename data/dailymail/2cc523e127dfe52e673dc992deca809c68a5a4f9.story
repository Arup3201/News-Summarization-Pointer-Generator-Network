Thugs: Lee Daniels (left) and Kieran Wright (right) stabbed defenceless Stephen Briggs-Bennett 13 times for the keys to his Mercedes

Two thugs who stabbed a defenceless driver 13 times and ran off laughing as they left him for dead have been jailed for a total of 21 and a half years.

Kieran Wright, 27, and Lee Daniels, 26, attacked the 60-year-old motorist for the keys to his Mercedes in a bungled car-jacking, but fled the scene without the £36,000 car.

Victim Stephen Briggs-Bennett was left with life-changing injuries after the broad-daylight attack on the driveway of a relative’s property on February 17.

His attackers later went out boozing on lager and vodka and were seen laughing and joking together.

When police approached Wright he said: 'I was going to come in tonight but United are playing at 7.30pm so I wanted to watch that first.'

And when officers arrested drunken Daniels for attempted murder, he said: 'Ha ha, no way.'

Mr Briggs-Bennett, a company supervisor, was leaving the home of his late father-in-law after popping round to do gather some things.

He was suddenly confronted by Wright and Daniels as he was about to get into his car in Hindley, near Wigan.

Wright, who was wearing a balaclava, grabbed the victim by his collar from behind and demanded his car keys before stabbing him with a double-bladed ornamental dagger.

The victim initially thought he was being punched, but then realised he was 'absolutely swimming in blood' and feared he would die.

Wright and Daniels, who was wearing a baseball cap and hood, were seen kicking Mr Briggs-Bennett as he lay defenceless on the ground.

The two men then grabbed a bunch of keys which he had dropped and tried to get into the Mercedes but ran off when they realised the set did not include the car key.

After the attack, Wright and Daniels 
ran to the nearby home of a female friend. They later got a taxi - 
stopping at a shop to buy lager and vodka.

Police later recovered the dagger from a drain.

Mr Briggs-Bennett staggered to a neighbour’s bungalow to ask for help. He later underwent an hour-long operation at Wigan Infirmary to stem the profuse bleeding.

He was then transferred to Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, where he had five hours of surgery to try to repair the damage.

Boozing: The pair went out drinking after the brutal attack

The knife had caused injuries to his shoulder, neck, face and arm, including a 10cm slash to his left arm which cut down to the bone and severed 90 per cent of his radial nerve.

Another cut sliced through the muscle on his arm, while a third wound to his finger has damaged nerves, arteries and tendons.

Doctors have said Mr Briggs-Bennett, who is still an outpatient and is having twice weekly physiotherapy sessions, may never fully recover and is unable to grip items.

He needs help from his wife with everyday tasks like getting dressed. He has returned to work part time but can no longer drive or do DIY, both of which he enjoyed.

He also has to wear a brace and splint to aid his recovery.

In a statement he said he did not believe his attackers will ever realise how severely they have damaged his life.

Last Friday at Liverpool Crown Court, Daniels and Wright both pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon. 

Daniels was given ten and a half years and Wright, who also admitted an unrelated offence of taking a vehicle without consent, was jailed for 11 years.

Det Sgt Graham Clare from Wigan Police division, said: 'Thankfully the victim survived this horrendous, unprovoked attack.

'He has recovered enough for him to be able to return to work, but has been left with life-changing injuries which are a constant reminder of the terror he felt that morning.

'It is by chance and not design that his horrific injuries did not prove fatal. He was stabbed numerous times just so these would-be thieves could steal his car.

'His life has been irrevocably changed for the worse and there is no sentence that can alter that. I hope these men can now reflect on the long-term damage they have caused.'
