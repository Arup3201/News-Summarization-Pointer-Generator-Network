Christopher Murray, 48, (pictured in his mugshot on Sunday) confessed to killing his wife and mother of their two daughters, police said

A husband strangled his wife and dumped her body in a park after she accused him of cheating, police revealed on Sunday.

Christopher Murray, 48, confessed to killing Constance 'Connie' Murray, 46, at Pennypack Park close to their home in Philadelphia. 

Police said that the couple, who have two daughters, had ongoing marriage problems.

Mrs Murray was found dead on Tuesday morning after reportedly going for her routine jog in the park on Monday at 9pm.

However investigators later discovered that she left her home to go for a walk. Murray then trailed his wife in a car and the two argued.

Murray continued to follow her and the pair went to a bench at the park where they continued to fight.

'She went up there voluntarily to talk to him about whatever was going on and things went bad,' said Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Philip Riehl.

Christopher Murray strangled his wife and left her body near the bench, police said. He called police on Tuesday morning at 2am to report her missing after he told them he had been out searching for her for hours. 

A woman walking her dog found Connie Murray's body early the next morning in the park close to a cemetery. An autopsy revealed she had been strangled following a struggle. 

Police sources told NBC that Mrs Murray accused her husband of infidelity. Murray reportedly told police that his wife began to slap him and he snapped. 

Surveillance video showed Christopher Murray in his vehicle and he was taken in for questioning on Saturday night.

Aspects of his story didn't add up, police said. The 48-year-old had gone to hospitals checking for his wife and called police but didn't contact any family or friends to see if she had gone to see them. 

Murray failed a lie detector test and then confessed.

Murray confessed this weekend to strangling his wife Connie after an argument. Her body was found in a cemetery last Tuesday morning in a Philadelphia suburb

'The reality was he became a suspect early on and remained a suspect until he confessed,' Lt Riehl said.

Riehl said Murray has expressed remorse. 'I think it was more of a rage incident more than premeditated,' he added. 

Mrs Murray had been missing her headphones and smartphone. Police sources told NBC that her husband dumped them in a drain along the edge of a wooded area of Pennypack Park near Holme-Crisp Cemetery.

Murray has been charged with his wife's murder. He was arraigned on Sunday and was denied bail. He is due back in court for a hearing on August 27.   

Police said on Sunday that surveillance video showed Murray in his car following his wife along the road as she walked to the park

Mrs Murray's funeral will be held today at 11am. She leaves two daughters, aged 12 and 15. 

On Friday, a $36,000 reward was offered for information that would help catch her killer.

Earlier in the week, police had warned women in the area not to walk alone in the park until the killer was caught. 

In a phone interview with the Philadelphia Daily News last week, Christopher Murray described his wife's death as 'devastating' and said she was 'a beautiful woman, a loving, caring mother, a fabulous friend'.  

A large gathering of friends and family, including her two young daughters, were seen embracing each other outside the Murray home last Wednesday. 

Neighbor Jim Kowalski told NBC that he was shocked as Murray had seemed genuinely devastated by his wife's death. 

He told the TV station: 'He was just in disbelief, like he couldn't believe that it happened.'

Police said Christopher Murray, pictured with his wife  and the couple's two daughters, admitted to strangling her after she reportedly accused him of cheating on her

Police were initially baffled by the strangling and struggled to find a motive. They had warned women in the area to be on high alert because a killer was on the loose
