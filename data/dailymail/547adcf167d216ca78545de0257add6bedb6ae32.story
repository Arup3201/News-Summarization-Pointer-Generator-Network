She has no doubt already gone up a few dress sizes.

But that’s not the only change pregnant Martine McCutcheon, 38, has gone through as she waits to give birth to her baby next year.

Yesterday, the actress revealed she can no longer stand the smell and taste of meat now she’s pregnant - and is instead going vegetarian.

Tweeting to her 85,000 followers, she said: ‘Morning folks! How are we all today? I’m going to meet my friend for brunch/lunch - I fancy a veggie fry up! #goneoffmeat #pregnant’

Her sudden distaste for sausages and bacon is not uncommon for a mother-to-be, according to experts. Many find their senses dramatically change as their body accounts for another person inside.

Pregnancy expert Clare Byam-Cook said: ‘As soon as you get pregnant, your senses are hugely heightened. It’s totally normal to be repulsed by smells that you previously enjoyed and to crave things that you never ever thought of craving. It’s just the way the body works.’

The former midwife added: ‘It normally kicks in almost as soon as you get pregnant – that’s how a lot of people know they’re pregnant – and it usually remains throughout your pregnancy. Only for it to disappear the second you have the baby.’

The change in diet will only be a minor sacrifice though for the former EastEnders star, who recently said she had longed for nothing more than to start a family with her husband, musician Jay McManus, 30.

She admitted she had almost resigned herself to being childless – until she finally became pregnant in May.

Last month, she told a magazine: ‘We’d always said that if we were fortunate to be blessed with a child, that would be wonderful, but we were very aware that it’s not a given.

‘As a woman in her late 30s who’s experienced health problems, I thought I might have to accept that it wasn’t a path my life was going to take, but it would have been a great sadness in our lives if that had been the case.’

The baby - due on St Valentine’s Day next year - is welcome news after McCutcheon’s seven year fight against chronic fatigue syndrome and depression.

She did not appear in any film or television productions from Echo Beach in 2008 to Let’s Get Gold in 2012 – leading to her being declared bankrupt last year – after her poor health became so severe that she was unable to work.

She said: ‘It was a terrible time in our lives but you discover who your friends are and we found amazing support from people who really came through for us.

‘It’s like finally the tides have turned. Great things are starting to happen on the work front, but more than anything, expecting our baby boy has given us clarity about what matters.’

The NHS advises mums-to-be to avoid rare meat and to be cautious with cold cured meats, though pre-packed meat is safe to eat.

It adds that most fish is particularly good for the health of the unborn baby.

However, the health body also warns that pregnant mothers should avoid liver because it contains a lot of vitamin A, which can harm the baby.

The strong smell of coffee is one of the most common foodstuffs for pregnant mothers to go off, according to Mrs Byam-Cook. But mums-to-be can also crave bizarre flavours – such as charcoal or grass – because their bodies are low in certain vitamins and minerals.
