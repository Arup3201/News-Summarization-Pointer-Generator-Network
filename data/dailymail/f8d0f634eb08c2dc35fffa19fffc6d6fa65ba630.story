Young women in a village in India have been banned from wearing jeans and t-shirts because elders say they encourage rape.

Lawmakers in Khedar, in the Hisar region of northwest India, implemented the ban as part of a raft of measures designed to reduce sex attacks in the area.

Alcohol has also been outlawed while throwing a 'DJ party' will now carry a fine of 11,000 rupees (£125).

Trend setter? Khedar Village is in the north west of India. Alcohol has also been outlawed while throwing a 'DJ party' will now carry a fine of 11,000 rupees (£125).

Treatment of women in India has been 
thrust sharply under the spotlight in recent months, following the death of a 23-year-old medical student after she was gang raped on a bus in New Delhi.

There has been a groundswell protest in India ever since, with mass demonstrations for women's rights,
tougher rape laws and calls for sex attackers to be hanged.

Khedar village patriarch Sarpanch Shamsher Singh told the Times of India: 'We have decided to ban alcohol as it is the main reason behind rapes. We have also banned jeans and T-shirts for girl students as it is not a proper dress.'

Groundswell: Indian women march to mourn the death of a gang rape victim in New Delhi. The brutal case has caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged

Heavy security: The decision in Khedar comes as five men appeared in court today accused of gang-raping a 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi. She later died of her injuries

But while the decree may prove unpopular among young people in the town, it has been welcomed by older members of the village.

Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women.

So common, in fact, that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women.

In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers.

Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack.

Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack.

New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours.

Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011.

Shanti
Devi, a middle-aged woman present at the panchayat said, 'The decision 
of the panchayat is good and will check the harassment of girls. Poor 
dressing is the main reason behind rapes.'

Mahaveer Singh, a resident of the village, added: 'We welcome the decision of the panchayat and anyone organizing a DJ party in the village will be fined Rs 11,000. Our main purpose is to close the alcohol shops in the village as liquor is the main reason behind attacks on women.'

Meanwhile, a judge today ordered the trial of 
the five men accused of the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old 
student in Delhi be held 'in-camera' for the suspects' own safety after 
chaotic courtroom scenes.

More
than 150 people tried to cram into a courtroom meant to fit just 30 
people for the first hearing of the men charged with the abduction, gang
rape and murder of Jyoti Singh Pandey.

The
23-year-old physiotherapy student died in a Singapore hospital 13 days 
after being attacked as she made her way home from the cinema in New 
Delhi.

The woman - who 
has not been named for legal reasons - was thrown naked from the moving 
vehicle into the street where she lay for up to half an hour before 
anybody called emergency services. Days later she died from her 
injuries.

Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011.

And in New Delhi - known as the rape capital of India - one rape is reported every 18 hours.
