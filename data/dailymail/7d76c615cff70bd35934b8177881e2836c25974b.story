Darren Bent has had stolen two top-of-the-range cars worth £160,000 after burglars raided his home while he slept.

The Aston Villa striker, who is currently on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion, was targeted by the thieves last Saturday night at his Little Aston property, near Sutton Coldfield.

The burglars swiped keys to a high-spec Range Rover and a luxury Audi RS6, both worth around £80,000, before stealing them from the driveway.

Bent's home was targeted early last Saturday morning after thieves broke in through a window

Former England international Bent, signed by Villa for £18million in 2011, was shipped out on loan to Brighton last month. He has scored one goal in three games and had started for the struggling Championship side in their 1-0 defeat at home by Millwall the night before the burglary.

Staffordshire Police were called to the address at 3.15am and discovered locks on a uPVC window had been snapped.

Following an 'orderly' search, thieves had found car keys and driven off with the vehicles.

Despite his record-breaking move to the Midlands, Bent made only one start for Villa this season under manager Paul Lambert.Despite his record-breaking move to the Midlands, Bent made only one start for Villa this season under manager Paul Lambert.

Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said the break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows.

'Offenders have snapped the lock cylinder in two by applying force to the cylinder,' he said.

The method of 'lock snapping' is becoming more prevalent among thieves as it can be completed within a matter of seconds.

The crime caps a frustrating year for Bent, who has also played for Ipswich, Tottenham and Sunderland.

Bent said of his month-long stint at the Seagulls: 'I wasn't getting a lot of game time at Aston Villa and it doesn't bother me that I've had to drop down a division to play football.

'I've seen Brighton play and they play like a Premier League team. They play good football. That's why I wanted to come here and join them.' 

Bent's agent did not respond to a request for comment.

The striker joins a growing list of footballers who have been targeted by criminals.

Stoke striker Peter Crouch and his wife Abbey Clancy have also been the victims of two break-ins.

The couple were said to be 'distraught' after thieves broke into their Cheshire home and turned the house upside down looking for jewellery in 2011.

Entering through a kitchen window, the criminals made off with a number of rings, thought to belong to Clancy, as well as a watch and a laptop computer.

And in 2010, Martin Wilson, 22, admitted to his role in the burglary of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's home.

Gerrard's wife Alex Curran was home with the couple's children when Wilson and the gang smashed into their home, threatening to take her children if she did not hand over jewellery and cash.

Gerrard was in Marseille at the time playing in a Liverpool Champions League tie.

Former Scottish footballer Duncan Ferguson also famously detained a man who broke into his home in Rufford, near Liverpool.

Playing for Everton at the time, the striker confronted the pair of thieves. Although one managed to flee, his partner in crime spent three days in hospital after having been detained by Ferguson until police arrived.

Police are warning homes using cylinder locks, like those the thieves broke at Darren Bent's home, are extremely vulnerable to burglary.

A practice known as 'lock snapping' has been disseminated among criminals whereby  locks featuring a cylinder are able to be easily snapped. Once broken and removed, thieves can then manipulate the locking mechanism and open the door.

Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said Bent's break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows.

He said: 'Thieves have devised methods of snapping these types of cylinders locks in a matter of seconds while still being able to operate the lock to open the door.

'They’re then able to look for the keys to the cars they’ve seen outside and drive them away.

'This threat can be reduced simply by upgrading the cylinder to one that is specifically designed to prevent this method of attack. We recommend that all vulnerable doors using Euro-Profile cylinder locks be upgraded to incorporate ‘Break Secure’ cylinders.'
