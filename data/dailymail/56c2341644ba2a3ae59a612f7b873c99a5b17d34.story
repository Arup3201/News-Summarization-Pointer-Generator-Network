Formula One star Jenson Button finally tied the knot with lingerie model Jessica Michibata as the pair married at a lavish ceremony in Hawaii. 

The 34-year-old began dating the Argentine-Japanese model back in December 2008. 

While Michibata has always been happy for Button to put his career first, she made no secret of the fact that she had her eye on marriage.

As far back as 2009 she said: ‘He told me he wants to get married – he said he is the marrying type. If Jenson wins the title we will celebrate by him getting down on one knee. He told me I am the one for him. I hope he means it.’

While Button, worth a reported £63million, did win that season, an engagement was not forthcoming. 

However Michibata had her patience rewarded on Valentine’s Day this year, with a ring reported to be worth £250,000. And the couple walked down the aisle on Monday after a ten-month engagement.

Button had flings with a string of women including Prince Harry’s ex – 29-year-old model Florence Brudenell-Bruce – before meeting Miss Michibata in Tokyo through mutual friends.

But arm-in-arm and exchanging loving glances, the pair looked radiantly happy as they posed for photos and drove off into the sunset after the ceremony this week. The model has previously said: ‘Of course, I read about him being a playboy, but I don’t see that side of him. We spend nights watching films and making sushi rather than going out to nightclubs.’

Congratulations: Many fans took to Twitter to congratulate the couple on their wedding

Rocky start: The Japanese model first met Jenson in 2008 in a hotel bar in Tokyo and originally perceived him to be something of a womaniser, turning him down when he first asked her out

Winning: It wasn't until Button became Formula One World Champion in Brazil in 2009 that she realised just how strong his love for her was, when he dedicated his win to her, live on television
