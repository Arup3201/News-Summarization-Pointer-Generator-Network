The man whose car was hijacked by the Boston marathon bombers broke his silence in his first televised interview on Tuesday.

Danny, a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur, reveals his harrowing encounter when he life hung in the balance in his nearly two hour drive with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarneav.

The man, who is keeping his identify concealed and had his voice altered for the on-air interview, downplayed his brave reaction and said he only though about 'trying to save myself.'

Speaking out: The man who was hijacked 'Danny,' pictured, wishes to conceal his true identity and had his face concealed and his voice altered for his Tuesday interview with CBS News

Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, hijacked the driver's car in Boston on the evening of April 18 (the brothers pictured on April 15 just moments before the Marathon blast

The driver says he had pulled his car over to the side of the road to text when Tamerlan Tsarnaev approached his Mercedes at 11pm on April 18. The 26-year-old jumped in his car.

'I thought it was just a robbery, you 
know?' Danny told CBS. 'He took out his gun, pointed to me. He told me that "You now I am serious. Don't be stupid."'

'He asked me a question, like, "Do you 
know the Boston explosion on Monday?" I said, "yes." He said, you know, "I did that. And I just killed a policeman in Cambridge."'

To begin with Danny was driving his car with Tamerlan in the passenger seat beside him, while Dzhokhar following behind in a sedan.

Later the brother’s moved all the gear into Danny’s car and Tamerlan drove. The late-night drive lasted an hour and a half.

Frightening: The driver of the car Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar (right) spoke mainly in Russian but then switched to English when they asked the man, Danny, about getting to New York

Both brothers primarily spoke in Russian during the drive but Danny says that at one point they began to inquire about New York City.

'I only heard one word. It's Manhattan. It seemed like they were going to New York because they asked me a lot of questions,' he said.

Officials in New York confirmed the brothers had decided, after the FBI released photos of them on April 18, to drive to Manhattan and detonate more explosives in Times Square.

The plan was confirmed by law enforcement officials who have been interviewing the surviving suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar, in the aftermath of his capture on April 19.

During the terrifying experience, the driver said that his roommate became worried about him because he wasn't home yet and called Danny on his cell phone.

Danny told the men, 'if you don't want me to pick up the phone, I won't pick it up. I won't say anything.'

Tamerlan responded 'you have to answer the phone. But if you use any single world in Chinese, I will kill you,' the man remembers.

'I just told him I'm going to sleep over at a friend's place tonight,' Danny said. 'So after, I hang up the phone. Tamerlan was very happy. He said, "Good job. Good boy."'

Escape: The two bombing suspects pulled up at the Shell gas station to use a stolen ATM card from their hostage Danny. He managed to escape to the Mobil gas station across the street and call for help (right)

During the drive, Danny now reveals how he began to plan an escape.

He began plotting his exit, thinking through the steps of unlocking his door, unfastening his seat belt and pulling the handle of the door to open it.

The car ran out of gas so the trio had to stop at a gas station.

At that moment, he seized the opportunity to leave when Dzhokhar left the car to pay for the gasoline and Tamerlan was distracted as he tried to work the GPS.

'I was counting. I was counting. I was just, "one two, three, four." And I just do it. And I did it. I can feel Tamerlan trying to grab me ... I was just running as fast as I can and I never look back.'

He escaped across the street to the Mobil gas station and begged the clerk on duty to call police.

Hours later, the brothers were tracked by police and a shoot out began in a quiet neighborhood in Watertown, Mass.

His Mercedes SUV sustained 32 bullet holes during the gunfire.

Looking back, Danny thanks the brave law enforcement officers who worked tirelessly to track down the suspects.

'The police, they are the hero. They exchange gunfire with the bad guys. I think they are the heroes,' he said. 

During the ferocious gunbattle ensued, the older brother Tamerlan, 26, was killed but 19-year-old Dzhokhar managed to escape.

The entire city of Boston was on lockdown on April 19 while police frantically searched for Dzhokhar.

He was found that Friday evening, hiding under a tarp in a boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown.
