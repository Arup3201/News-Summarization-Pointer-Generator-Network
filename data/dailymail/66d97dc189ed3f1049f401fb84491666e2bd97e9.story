A footballer raped a girl with two of his friends after a night out clubbing, a court heard today.  

Cristian Montano, an Oldham Athletic midfielder, allegedly took the woman to a flat in Romford, Essex and attacked her while she was passed out.  

She told jurors that she woke up and pleaded with the men to stop, but they continued raping her.  

Montano, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court along with his friends Andres Hurtado, 23, and Camilo Valencia, 22. All three men deny rape.  

'Attack': Footballer Cristian Montano, right,  and his friend Andres Hurtado, left, are alleged to have raped a woman following a night out in July 2012

The woman said she woke up to find that she was naked and the Colombian footballer was having sex with her.  

The court heard that when he had finished Hurtado pulled his trousers down and had sex with the 22-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons.  

She claimed she repeatedly told the men to get off her, but she could not move as Valencia climbed on top of her and continued the attack.  

The woman met the men during a night out with a friend in Romford in July 2012, jurors were told.  

Gang: Camilo Valencia is also alleged to have taken part in the attack on a 22-year-old woman 

Giving evidence via video link, she told the court she remembered leaving the nightclub before losing her friend and blacking out.  

'My next memory was waking up in the bedroom, naked, with no clothes on,' she said.  

'I don't remember how I got there or taking my clothes off - I didn't know where I was and I hadn't been there before.  

'One of them was having sex with me and he said something in another language and then a couple of them came back into the room.  

'I was trying to push him off me but I couldn't, he was too strong but I was saying "Get off me." The others were just stood there watching.  

'Immediately after that another guy got into the bed and he penetrated me as well. I kept saying "No" but he didn't say anything and he just kept going.  

'I tried to get up and move off the bed but I couldn't, then another guy, he was already undressed, and it was all over quickly.  

'I went into the bathroom and sat there for a bit - I felt dirty.'  

The men called her a taxi, which took her to a friend's house, the court heard.  

She said that she was given her clothes and mobile phone back, but a clutch bag she had when she left the club was never returned.  

The woman told the court: 'They were saying to me like, "Don't worry it's not your fault," trying to act like I wanted it to happen and I consented.'  

Montano was playing for West Ham United at the time of the alleged attack, but later moved to League One club Oldham.  

He has also spent time on loan at Notts County, Swindon Town, Dagenham and Redbridge and Oxford United.  

The case continues.
