With their stubborn tempers and massive jaws, rottweilers haven't always had the best reputation.

But these dogs laid that ghost to rest by saving a shivering trapped pensioner - who they licked placidly until a human came to raise the alarm.

The 80-year-old woman had been stuck in a field for 15 hours following a fall, and would have remained there all night had Tillie, Billy, Gerrard and May not found her during a 1am walk.

Owner David Malt said the incident unfolded when his pets, aged eight, six, five and three, scampered off during the late-night walk next to Bournside School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

He followed the rottweiliers as they made a beeline for a bush in the school playing field - where he only walks the dogs when the field is deserted because of their fearsome reputation.

When he and his nephew Jack caught up with the pets, the pair discovered them sitting with an 80-year-old woman and licking her gently.

She was conscious and told Mr Malt she had been trapped in the bush since 10am the previous day after losing her footing.

He immediately called an ambulance following the incident, which happened in the early hours of January 3, and she was taken to hospital suffering from exposure. 

Jack's mother Lana Martenovic, who also owns a rottweiler from the same family, credits the gentle giants with saving the woman's life.

'They bounded over the field when they were let off the lead,' she said. 'The female dog started licking her and refused to leave her side until my son and his uncle arrived.

'The woman had been stuck there in the bushes all day, since about 10am, but she didn't make a sound when the dogs found her.

'She told the boys later that she got off the bus at the wrong stop.

'If my son and brother in law hadn't have walked their dogs at that time, it might have been a very different outcome for the lady. I don't think she would have survived.'

A spokesman for the South Western Ambulance Service said paramedics were called at 1.20am on January 3 to treat an 80-year-old woman who was suffering from exposure to the cold.

She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital for treatment. 

Used as guard dogs for centuries, rottweilers are known for their stubborn natures and strong jaws, which can refuse to let go of an object unless the dogs are taught the firm command 'drop it'.

But owners say the breed is unfairly maligned, and have set up a society called The Rottweilier Club to rehabilitate its image.

While club members admit the dogs can be 'strong, very demanding and somewhat arrogant', with a firm and sympathetic hand they can be loyal and gentle to almost anyone they encounter.

Ms Martenovic said: 'Rottweilers don't have a great reputation because they are perceived as aggressive, but they're really protective, and originally bred as working dogs.

'So it is good to hear some positive news about them.'
