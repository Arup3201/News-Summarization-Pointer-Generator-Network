A couple who made a harrowing video of their baby boy being taken away by social workers at six hours old yesterday backed a senior judge’s call to expose family courts to ‘the glare of publicity’.

The parents secretly filmed the moment council staff seized their fourth child after being told they were not capable of looking after his elder siblings. They then posted the clip online.

The footage shows the 36-year-old mother, who has learning difficulties, screaming ‘No!’ as social workers warn they will ‘get physical’ if the couple resist.

Yesterday her husband backed Sir James
 Munby’s attack on the secrecy which shrouds Britain’s family courts as 
he rejected the local council’s bid for an injunction to suppress the 
video.

The injunction 
was also designed to prevent anyone knowing the names of the social 
workers, or discovering the name of the local authority that applied for
 the order, Staffordshire County Council.

Sir
 James, president of the Family Division of the High Court, also 
rejected the council’s bid to bar the father from sharing information 
about the case.

And in a
 dramatic intervention, he said there was a ‘pressing need’ for more 
transparency in the family justice system as a whole.

Destroyed: The father says he was left feeling powerless and upset by the removal of his baby son

The
 41-year-old husband at the centre of the case said yesterday: ‘Taking 
our children away destroyed my life and my wife’s life. I posted the 
video to show how draconian the state can be even when social workers 
have accepted we would never have harmed our children.’

The
 father, whose comments could not be printed until the judge’s 
intervention, added: ‘Hopefully if there’s more openness in how these 
decisions are made it will prevent injustices.’

They
 claim social workers removed their baby because they decided the mother
 was incapable of bringing them up because of her learning disability.

The couple said it was only after they had a second daughter in 2008 they came ‘under the microscope’.

Sir James Munby said the baby's father should not be prevented from sharing information about the case after Staffordshire Council tried to gag him

Two
 years later, the mother was accused of pulling her elder daughter’s 
hair – which she denies – and after an investigation, both girls were 
taken away. The couple had a third daughter last year, but she was taken
 away aged six hours, the same fate that was to befall their baby son, 
known only as J.

Accompanied
 by police, social workers allegedly citing ‘risk of emotional harm’ 
took him away following his birth in April, unaware the father was 
filming on a computer webcam.

In
 the video, the mother is clearly distraught as her husband remonstrates
 with officers and council staff at their Staffordshire home. In June 
the father was given a suspended six-week prison sentence for refusing 
to co-operate in removing the video from internet sites.

An
 edited version of it plus the parents’ account can only now be 
published following Sir James’s ruling, although they still cannot be 
named in order to protect their children, three of whom have now been 
adopted.

The father said: 
‘The social workers said my wife and I were in a volatile relationship. 
There has never been violence. The court was told there was a risk the 
children would come to harm in the future. They were never harmed.’

He
 added: ‘The judge’s comments are a step in the right direction, but I’d
 like to see the Press allowed into all family courts to stop social 
workers getting away with telling lies.’

The
 father said that although social workers considered his wife disabled, 
her disability benefits were halted after intervention by council staff,
 and because neither work they had to be supported by family.

Staffordshire
 council said it had never tried to shield itself from scrutiny. ‘I 
believe any parent in this situation should be able to tell their story,
 but the prime interest of the local authority is that the child has to 
be protected,’ council leader Philip Atkins said.

Last
 night the British Association of Social Workers warned that encouraging
 aggrieved families to publicise their experiences risked ‘demonising’ 
their profession.

Chief
 executive Bridget Robb said: ‘Such images do not tell the whole story. 
If the public want children to be protected, they have to get behind 
social workers, understand that removal of a child is not a decision 
taken lightly by them alone.

Sire James Munby told his colleagues they must learn to deal with offensive and defamatory material on the internet, rather than ‘throw up their hands and moan’.

The country’s most senior family law judge said much of what is posted online about the courts is ‘highly objectionable’ but the law had to adapt to it and judges must stick to the ‘fundamentally important principles’ of free speech.

Sir James spoke during his High Court ‘Child J’ ruling this week, one of the first to advise judges on how to deal with material on the web and social media.

He said: ‘The internet allows anyone, effectively at the click of a mouse, to publish whatever they wish.

‘The consequence is that the internet is awash with material couched in the most exaggerated, extreme, offensive and often defamatory terms, much of which has only a tenuous connection with objectively verifiable truth.  

‘The law must develop and adapt, as it always has done down the years in response to other technologies. We must not simply throw up our hands in despair and moan that the internet is uncontrollable. Nor can we simply abandon basic legal principles.’
