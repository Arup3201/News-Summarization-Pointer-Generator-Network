A portrait of the cast for Downton Abbey's Christmas special has been released - and reveals a few clues about the much-anticipated storyline.

The picture features actress Shirley Maclaine, confirming that her character Martha Levinson will make a re-appearance for the one-off festive episode.

Oscar-nominated US actor Paul Giamatti, pictured in a tuxedo, will also make his Downton debut as Cora's 'maverick playboy' brother, Harold.

Festive special: A portrait of the cast of Downton's Christmas episode was released on Monday

The show's executives have revealed that he will play 'the rather free-spirited uncle to Mary and Edith' and that he and Maclaine will 'upset the Grantham's apple cart in this year's finale'.

Stood next to Giamatti in the formal photograph is veteran British actor James Fox.

Fox, who has starred in films such as Sherlock Holmes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, will play an unknown, but well-heeled character, in the Christmas special.

Meanwhile, Lady Edith, who discovered 
she was expecting a baby with Michael Gregson, her married editor, 
displays no signs of pregnancy in the picture.

Viewers
 will be left to speculate about whether the episode skips forward in 
time to after the birth of her child, or if she went ahead with the 
illegal abortion she contemplated in a past episode.

Downton
 fans will be relieved to see that key figures such as Lord and Lady 
Grantham, Lady Mary and the Dowager Countess, played by Dame Maggie 
Smith, will be starring in the episode.
