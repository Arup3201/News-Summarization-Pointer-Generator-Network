Accused: Nigel Evans, the Conservative MP, today denied nine sexual offence charges when he appeared before Preston Crown Court

The former deputy speaker Nigel Evans today denied nine sexual offence charges against seven men when he appeared before a judge.

The MP for Ribble Valley in Lancashire entered formal not guilty pleas during the pre-trial hearing at Preston Crown Court.

He stood in the dock, hands clasped at his front, to repeat 'not guilty' as each charge was put to him.

The 56-year-old is accused of two counts of indecent assault, six of sexual assault and one of rape.

The indictment includes an extra charge of sexual assault which was only added to the charge sheet today.

All of the offences are alleged to have taken place from 2002 to April 1, last year.

Evans resigned as Commons deputy speaker after he was charged on September 10.

The 10-minute hearing was taken up by legal argument as the court prepares for the forthcoming trial.

The judge, Mr Justice King, reminded the press none of the seven complainants, all adult males, must be publicly identified in their reports.

Evans was granted bail by the judge until his trial date, which has been set for March 10.

'Thank you, my lord,' he replied.

The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1 2002 and January 1 2004; the sexual assaults - said to be touching without consent - between January 1 2009 and April 1 last year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 last year.

Evans made a personal statement in the House the day after he was charged, claiming that facing the allegations was as hard as dealing with the deaths of his mother and brother in the past few years.

The Swansea-born MP, who lives in Pendleton, Lancashire, was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010.

Evans was a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001.

As deputy speaker, he sat as an independent MP but he will not take the Conservative whip and will sit as an independent MP for his constituency.
