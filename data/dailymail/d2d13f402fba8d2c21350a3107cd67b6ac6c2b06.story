Veteran TV weatherman Bill Giles has written a book accusing his fellow BBC forecasters of plotting to oust him from the team.

The retired 73-year-old, who led the BBC's team of on-screen forecasters for 17 years from 1983, accuses colleagues of plotting, back-stabbing and bitter rivalry in his book 'You Have Wives?', which is set to be published next year.

Giles claims Michael Fish - who he claims 'never did like me' - and John Kettley were behind a secret plot to overthrow him.

Revealing a lengthy feud with Fish, Giles said his rapid rise up the ranks of the Met Office upset his colleague.

‘Michael never did like me ever since I appeared on TV a year after him, got promotion, and in 1983 came back as his boss.’Fish will forever be famous for his television blunder hours before a devastating hurricane hit the country in October 1987. He said a woman had rung the BBC to say there was a hurricane on the way and he told viewers: ‘Don’t worry, there isn’t!’

And Giles, 73, has rubbed salt into his rival’s wounds by writing: ‘I understand it was to be put in the Guinness Book of Records as the worst forecast in the history of universe and if it wasn’t it should have been.’

He reportedly attacked Ian McCaskill - a
popular character famed for his eccentric and jovial manner - for once 
dismissing him as being like ‘a prefect at a minor public school.’

The book entitled ‘You Have Wives?’ is being co-written by John Teather, former editor at the BBC Weather Centre.

All the forecasters who appeared on the BBC were employed by the Met Office and there were constant problems between the two organisations, the book claims.

Giles alleges that John Kettley and Fish plotted to overthrow him. The book recalls a time when Giles was investigated and found guilty of harassment (although the decision was later overturned).

He claimed Fish emailed to his ‘fellow conspirators’ the message 'one down and one to go' and alleged there was a plot to get rid of him and Teather.Fish denied writing any email.

Mr Kettley told the Times he was neither aware of nor interested in Mr Giles' claims, 'because it is all the way back in history'.
