A puppy needed a three hour operation after swallowing a sewing needle which became lodged in her spinal cord.

Eight month old golden Labrador Fudge survived the operation unscathed and without any permanent damage despite the 1.5 inch needle piercing soft tissue and becoming lodged in the joint of her spine and skull.

The needle was only discovered after Fudge collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy's agony.

Lucky: Paul Manville, with Labrador puppy Fudge who survived swallowing a needle and it becoming lodged in her spine

Painful: An x-ray image shows a 1.5 inch needle lodged in Fudge's spinal cord

Owner Paul Manville, 45, said: 'Fudge had broken through the stair gate and demolished the bedroom - she played with a couple of plastic hairbrushes and had bitten them.

'Then three days later when I took her for a walk she dropped to the floor and screamed in pain.

'I thought she had swallowed something and had something in her stomach so I took her to the vets.

'She had an x-ray of her stomach but it didn't show anything so they decided to open her up and have a look at it anyway.

He added: 'But they still didn't find anything and her agony remained a mystery.

'It was really stressful as she was still having fits of pain and we thought we were going to have to put her down.

'The next day I took her back to the vets and they X-rayed her head and neck and that's when they found the needle lodged.'

Mystery: The needle was only discovered after Fudge collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy's agony

Agony: A scan picture shows the needle lodged in Fudge's spinal cord. She needed a three-hour operation to have it removed

Paul, who did not have pet insurance and had to fork out £4,500 pounds on vet bills for Fudge, took the dog 90 miles north to the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, to remove the needle.

Colin Driver, one of the vets who operated on Fudge, said: 'You don't expect to see a dog with a needle in their spinal cord so we were very shocked, it was quite extraordinary.

'We had to be extremely careful not to move the spinal cord when we removed the needle, as like in humans it is connected to all the nerve endings and could leave permanent damage.

Costly: Fudge's owner Paul had to shell out £4,500 on vets fees as he had no pet insurance

'Afterwards I had expected to see some swelling which might have made Fudge weak or have neurological problems.

'I told the owner not to expect her to walk the next day but she was up walking around with no problems and was back to her normal self.

'We were really pleased.'

Paul said Fudge is now fully recovered and has been playing with his other Labrador, Shadow, ten.
