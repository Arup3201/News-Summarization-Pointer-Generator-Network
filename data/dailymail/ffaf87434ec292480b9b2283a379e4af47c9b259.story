With players banned from wearing anything but white and visitors exhorted to dress smartly, Wimbledon's dress codes are almost as famous as its tennis.

But two fans decided to put neat dresses and tidy chinos to one side, and turned up wearing unusual bikini tops made from tennis balls instead.

Completing their unusual ensembles were novelty sunglasses, one pair topped with a model Big Ben and the other with a tropical palm tree.

Are you sure that's allowed? A pair of tennis fans brave the  weather at Wimbledon in tennis ball bikini tops

Despite the chilly weather - and the occasional shower that left other Wimbledon fans running for cover - the patriotic pair looked cheerful, perhaps helped along by their glasses of Pimms.

Although Wimbledon has no formal dress code, the official guide to the tennis tournament warns that 'the removal of shirts or [wearing] any clothing likely to cause offence' could result in ejection from the south London venue.

Members of the All England Lawn Tennis Club do, however, have to adhere to a strict set of rules about what they can wear, with distressed denim, midriff baring tops and leggings all outlawed.

Instead, the club asks guests to wear a 'lounge suit or tailored jacket, shirt, tie, trousers and dress shoes. Ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard.'

Brrr! Fans arriving at Wimbledon were forced to unfurl umbrellas and don their rain macs this morning

Chilly: A patriotic fan sits down to watch the tennis on Murray Mount safely beneath a huge umbrella

Although anything goes on Murray Mount, 
those watching from the Member's Enclosure are warned that rigid 
standards of dress will be 'strictly enforced'.

Players too have strict rules to follow, with many introduced following years of colourful, bottom-scraping tennis dresses and equally wacky men's shorts.

According to the latest set of rules, players must wear outfits that are 'almost entirely white', with large manufacturers’ logos 'not encouraged'.

Underwear must also be white, while caps, headbands, wristbands and socks must also be white, although coloured trims no wider than a centimetre are allowed.

On court: Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark was part of the crowd watching Danish Wozniaki beat Konjuh

Today sees Andy Murray back on court for the third time, with Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut providing the opposition.

Also on court today are Novac Djokovic and Venus Williams, while Danish star Caroline Wozniacki has already beaten Croatian challenger Ana Konjuh in straight sets.

Despite the big-hitters on the court, the crowds of tennis fans have garnered almost as much attention this time around - thanks in no small part to the celebrity quotient.

Today saw Carole and Michael Middleton join Terry Wogan in the Royal Box, as did Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Speaker of Parliament John Bercow.
