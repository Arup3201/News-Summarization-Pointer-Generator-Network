This contraption looks like something the Borg would use during a painful assimilation operation.

But despite its terrifying appearance, these strange goggles have been designed to help astronauts see better in space.

And it doesn’t need complicated cyborg technology to work – all that’s required is eyewash solution, a pump and a willing test subject.

Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst tests the space eyewash goggles at Nasa¿s Johnson Space Center in Houston

The goggles have been designed to clear flecks of dust and other particles from an astronaut’s vision while on board the International Space Station.

In zero gravity, all manner of substances could be found floating around in the air, from dust to chilli flakes and even sweat.

If something gets into an astronaut’s eye, it’s difficult to get it out because rinsing it under running water is impossible.

When firefighters want to extinguish a blaze, they often douse it with water.

Astronauts on board the ISS, however, are experimenting with a form of water that does the opposite.  Instead of stopping fire, this water helps start it.

'We call it ‘"supercritical water,"' said Mike Hicks of the Glenn Research Center in Ohio. 'And it has some interesting properties.'

Water becomes supercritical when it compressed to a pressure of 217 atmospheres and heated above 373°C.

Above that so-called critical point, ordinary H2O transforms into something that is neither solid, liquid, nor gas.  It's more of a 'liquid-like gas.'

'When supercritical water is mixed with organic material, a chemical reaction takes place—oxidation,' said Hicks. 'It's a form of burning without flames.'

The ISS doesn’t have running tap water, and if it did, the stream would float away in expanding bubbles of silvery liquid.

To combat the problem, engineers have come up with the space eye-wash googles, seen here on Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst at Nasa Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The goggles are connected to a specially-formulated solution that is pumped around the eyes.

Although the contraption might look painful, Gerst said: ‘It does not feel weird, but on the contrary it is good to know that we have these items onboard.

This medical refresher course is getting Gerst ready for his Blue Dot mission that begins 28 May.

Gerst will be leaving for space with cosmonaut Maxim Suraev and Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman for a six-month expedition on the International Space Station.

The geophysicist and volcanologist will become the third German to visit the ISS.
