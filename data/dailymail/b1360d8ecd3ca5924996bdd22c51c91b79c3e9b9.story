Manchester City were left stunned by referee Lee Mason’s failure to award a late penalty as Stoke City beat the reigning Premier League Champions 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

Yaya Toure appeared to be tripped in the penalty box by Stoke’s Erik Pieters as City searched for a late equaliser however Mason deemed that the Ivorian dived and booked the midfielder for simulation.

Remarkably City failed to find the net and a stunning solo goal from Mame Biram Diouf brought a first league win of the season for Stoke and a first defeat for Manuel Pellegrini’s side.

Heavy challenge: Yaya Toure powers past Stoke's Erik Pieters but was he tripped for a penalty?

Pellegrini was frustrated about the late penalty incident involving Toure but did not want to make a big issue of it.

He said: 'What I think doesn't matter. I don't talk about the referee. All of you know it was a clear penalty. It doesn't matter. I don't want to analyse the game.

‘The (Toure) penalty was just one play during the game. Everyone that saw it told me it was a clear penalty but it was one play in 90 minutes. I am more worried about the goal they scored because it was too easy.’
