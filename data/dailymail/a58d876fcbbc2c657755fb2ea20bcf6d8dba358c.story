If Uxizandre’s Ryanair Chase success on Thursday is to be AP McCoy’s last Festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory.

But, typically, at least for the time being, it will be confined to the recesses of the McCoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his Cheltenham career on Friday afternoon.

Over breakfast, he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction, you don’t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his Betfred Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm.

One thing is certain, the mood will be better at the McCoy table than it was 24 hours earlier.

AP McCoy rides Uxizandre to victory in Thursday’s Ryanair Chase for his 31st Cheltenham Festival win

McCoy celebrates with the trophy after his first Festival win of 2015 with his Peadar McCoy by his side

Wife Chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been ‘melancholy’ after two fruitless days amid, no doubt, a creeping fear that things were not going her husband’s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages.

McCoy's wife Chanelle admitted a ‘melancholy’ had come over AP after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16-1 shot

All that changed when 16-1 shot Uxizandre, not even the first string of his trainer Alan King in the Ryanair Chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor, galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of Ma Filleule.

Even the crowd seemed stunned at first. The roar took time to grow but by the time McCoy had returned to the winners’ enclosure, they were raising three cheers.

After being joined on the winner’s podium by Chanelle, his father Peadar and boss JP McManus, McCoy said: ‘Cheltenham is a very special place. It is where every jockey wants to win and I am no different. These are the days I am going to miss that’s for sure.

‘I had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers.

‘You have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins. That is how my life has normally been, so there is no point changing this week.

‘I was all right. You can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse — and this horse is very well.

‘I was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him.’

McManus, his ally for a decade, looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts.

He said: ‘It is great to have a man like AP on your side. I am just so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival and that we provided it for him makes it even better.

JP McManus, AP's ally for a decade, was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win

JP said: 'I am so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better'

‘I remember years ago Christy Roche rang me and said ‘‘Have you seen this young lad ride? He should be handicapped, not the horses’’.

‘I respect AP and love everything he does on and off the racecourse.’

McCoy will wear the green and gold McManus colours on John Kiely-trained Carlingford Lough, as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the Festival — Hargam, Princely Conn and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase which carries his own name.

McManus has not ruled out the dream Gold Cup ending

He said: ‘Carlingford Lough has a chance in a very open race. I was hoping he might be good enough.

‘He had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious. He improved from the run in the Lexus Chase at Christmas and has a good 10-1 chance of winning in an open Gold Cup.’

There are definitely plenty of dangers — about 17 of them — as few can be ruled out.

Defending champion Lord Windermere aims to win at his third consecutive Festival and provide his trainer, Jim Culloty, with a first win under rules since the week after last year’s Gold Cup. A win for last year’s fourth and the form horse of the race, favourite Silviniaco Conti, would also put his trainer Paul Nicholls, who additionally saddles Sam Winner, level with the late Tom Dreaper as a record five-time race winner.

McCoy stands with Carlingford Lough after their win in the Hennessey Gold Cup at Leopardstown on February 8. He'll be riding the same mount in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday shortly after 3.20pm

But his lack of course form is a worry and, the chaotic and close nature of last year’s finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners; horses like Noel Meade’s Road To Riches, Oliver Sherwood’s Many Clouds and Jonjo O’Neill’s Holywell, who at one point looked like being McCoy’s mount.

Also in that category is the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, behind whom there is growing confidence, and Carlingford Lough. But if McManus acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves, he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon- to-retire jockey.

‘We’ve had him cloned,’ he joked.
