The Obamas touched down in Berlin on Tuesday evening for a whirlwind 24-hour visit to Germany, the culmination of which will be the President's speech at the Brandenburg Gate.

The First Lady had made a quick change into a sleek black trouser-and-cardigan combo with studded belt while daughters Malia and Sasha were all smiles in short dresses and neon accessories.

The President left the plane holding his youngest daughter Sasha's hand, waving to the crowds gathered at Tegel Airport. Michelle followed with eldest daughter Malia who had styled her white lace dress with biker boots.

Mr Obama's speech today will inevitably be compared with JFK's 1963 address to the German capital in which he declared 'Ich bin ein Berliner' in solidarity with residents of West Berlin at the height of the Cold War.

During the brief trip, the President will hold meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other government officials but is likely to face some tough questions over his handling of the NSA surveillance scandal.

He arrived in Berlin following the two-day, G8 summit at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. There have already been tense moments on the trip, in particular during the President's discussions with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over the Syrian crisis.

During the summit, Michelle and daughters traveled to the Republic of Ireland to do some sightseeing. At points, Malia and Sasha had seem less than enthralled with the outings including a visit to the medieval Book of Kells in Trinity College, Dublin and the picturesque Glendalough.

The First Lady and her girls kept it casual for the short jaunt, spending Tuesday in jeans and sneakers and enjoying a pub lunch with rock star Bono.

It was all change when the family landed on the continent with Obama appearing to have found the tie he ditched during the summit while his wife and daughters ramped up their White House star quality.

The President's visit comes nearly 50 years to the day after John F. Kennedy's famous Cold War address in Berlin.

However compared to his last visit in
2008 - when then presidential candidate Obama received a rock-star 
welcome from 200,000 people - this trip is likely to be more 
uncomfortable visit for the U.S. leader who faces tough questions in 
Europe over the NSA surveillance of American citizens.

Protesters gathered on Tuesday at Checkpoint Charlie - the Berlin Wall crossing point 
between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War - to show their 
outrage at the Obama administration's surveillance of email and phone records.

Demonstrators
held up signs reading 'Yes We Scan' - playing on Obama's 2008 
presidential campaign slogan - along with the words 'Your privacy ends 
here'.

The U.S. leader was also likely to face tough questions from German officials over the NSA matter and leaks about the agency's secretive methods by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Germany's federal data protection commissioner, Peter Schaar, has already called the U.S.'s access of thousands of private social media and email accounts 'monstrous', according to the New York Times.

Obama will tomorrow set himself up as the heir to JFK when he makes a speech in Berlin in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

It
is almost exactly 50 years since JFK addressed a crowd of Germans at 
the height of the Cold War and declared: 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'

His
successor as U.S. President will attempt to channel the memory of that 
historic occasion when he delivers an address in the aftermath of the G8
summit in Northern Ireland.

Obama's speech on Wednesday will not be the first one he has given in Berlin.

Speech: Barack Obama, pictured today at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland with David Cameron and Francois Hollande, is set to give an address in Berlin on Wednesday

Parallels: John F. Kennedy delivered an iconic speech in Berlin on 26 June, 1963 - almost exactly 50 years ago

Five years ago, when he was still seeking election as President, Mr Obama received a rapturous reception on a brief tour of Europe where he was greeted as a leader who could give the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of George W. Bush.

Now he is a much more divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by most Europeans, recent revelations about his administration's spying on internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many.

Mr Obama's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with JFK's, which took place on June 26, 1963 at the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg, a few miles away from the Berlin Wall which had been under construction over the previous two years.

Kennedy's speech, considered one of his best, held up West Germany as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism.

It featured the famous line: 'All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, "Ich bin ein Berliner!"'

People have since suggested that the German quotation was in fact a mistranslation, meaning 'I am a jelly doughnut' rather than 'I am a Berliner', although no one appeared to comment on this at the time.

When Mr Obama, than a senator for Illinois, visited Berlin in 2008, he gave a speech to a crowd of more than 200,000 people, attracting headlines such as 'Germany meets the superstar'.

For his visit this week, by contrast, leading magazine Der Spiegel greeted him with the headline 'The Lost Friend'.

Although the President remains broadly popular among Germans, many are angry with his failure to close Guantanamo bay and the U.S. policy of targeting Islamic militants with drone attacks.

Moreover, recent revelations about the National Security Agency monitoring phone calls and internet use have further shaken his image.

'He is still popular but not like he was,' Henning Riecke, who heads the transatlantic relations programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, told Reuters.

'There's disappointment in Germany that he hasn't been able to close Guantanamo and there are concerns about his tactics in fighting terrorism. People have realised he's not a saint and he's not all-powerful.'

Meeting: The President is set to hold talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel; they are pictured in 2011

Mr Obama, who has not visited Germany since becoming President, is believed by many to have neglected Europe in favour of regions such as Asia and the Middle East.

He will give a speech to 4,000 invited guests on the eastern side of the Brandenburg Gate, in the Pariser Platz square - apparently chosen to avoid an embarrassing contrast with the turnout in 2008.

German chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to seek to take advantage of the meeting to boost her own chances of re-election ahead of the polls in September.

Talks between the two are likely to touch on issues including the ongoing eurozone crisis, the extent of the U.S. surveillance programme and the future of war-torn Syria.

Ms Merkel, who hails from the centre-Right, is sometimes said to have enjoyed better relations with George W. Bush, who invited her to his ranch in Texas and quizzed her about growing up in East Germany.
