Wingsuit enthusiast Brian Drake has been captured on film during a dangerous attempt to fly down a mountain just feet above the ground.

Together with and two other pilots Ellen Brennan and Ludovic Woerth, he got to the top of the famous Couloir l’Ensa in the French Alps and flew down the tight gully in his wingsuit.

The Couloir l’Ensa is considered the most difficult in the Le Brevent area in Chamonix, and is popular with off-piste skiers.
