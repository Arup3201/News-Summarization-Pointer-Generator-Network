Simone Buchanan was just a teenager when her Hey Dad! co-star Sarah Monahan first told her she was being sexually abused.

Robert Hughes' assault on young girls eventually became one of the most high profile cases of child sex abuse in Australian history, culminating in him being jailed for at least six years in May this year.

But back in the late 1980s when Ms Monahan first confided in Ms Buchanan about what he was doing, Ms Buchanan was just 17 and didn't know what to do.

'In the early days when it was just this and that I'd say just "Stay away from him", that's all I could do,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Buchanan, 46, tried to raise the issue with one of the show's producers, but says she was told to keep quiet about it.

'It was very, very grey,' she said.

'It was only later that it became more serious, and at my age it was not in my mind to go to police it was to go to my boss. I did what I thought was right.'

Now a Bravehearts ambassador, Ms Buchanan is speaking out ahead of White Balloon Day on Friday to encourage others to take action if they suspect a child they know is being abused.

'I think a lot of victims don't speak up until they're adults,' she said.

'What [Hughes] was doing to the others girl was worse but we didn't know about that.

'It was really when Sarah came forward all these year later that they finally spoke out.'

Hughes, 65, was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years and nine months in prison after he was found guilty of 10 child sex offences committed between 1983 and 1991, relating to four girls aged between seven and 15.

His victims included the daughter of a family friend, who he touched inappropriately in her family swimming pool, and two of his daughter's friends, whom he exposed himself to or sexually assaulted as they lay in bed during sleepovers.

Ms Buchanan is happy Hughes' trial is now behind her.

'It was a difficult time for everyone and I'm just glad that basically it is over,' she said.

'I think awareness has been raised through that particular time and I think it's just time that people realise just how prevalent [child sex abus] is and I think high profile cases like that help.

'What's come of this a lot of people have come forward, it has a ripple effect, and that's a positive thing.'

Ms Buchanan says she is still friends with Ms Monahan following the ordeal.

'She's doing well, she supports Bravehearts as well, and she's trying to move on with her life and make this a positive like everyone else,' she said.

Ms Buchanan said the whole experience has taught her how prevalent the issue of child sex abuse is.

'I had a lot of people write to me after the trial and tell me their stories,' she said.

'It's opened my eyes to how big the issue is and how massive the problem is globally, and it's been swept under the rug for so long.'

Her advice to people who suspect a child they know is being sexually abused is to talk to them, or involve a third party counsellor.

'They're one step removed and sometimes that's easier,' she said.

'It's a difficult one because often these kids are too scared to speak out because the perpetrator has threatened them and the safety of their family members.

'If you are someone whose noticing it I think most definitely speak to that child and try and help them to open up.'

White Balloon Day on Friday September 12 aims to raise awareness and funds for Australian children affected by sexual assault.

This year's #whoRUprotecting national campaign encourages Australians to act for the protection of the children in their lives.
