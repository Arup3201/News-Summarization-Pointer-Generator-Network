A shadowy Malaysia based company has applied to trade mark the word 'MH17' in what could be a sick attempt to profit from the tragic Malaysia Airlines disaster.

A business called Remit Now International Limited lodged an application with the Australian Trade Mark Office on July 18, just hours after 298 people were killed when their plane was shot out of the sky by a missile above eastern Ukraine.

Amongst the passengers on the doomed flight were 37 Australian citizens and residents.

The application on the Australian Trade Mark Office website, seen by Daily Mail Australia, shows that it is currently being examined by officials.

The company has applied for a Class 41 trade mark which includes entertainment, educational and cultural services which would cover film production, exhibition, curatorial and gallery services and live performances.

A person who owns a trade mark in Australia may be able to stop other people using the same or a similar trade mark in the country.

This means, for example, if someone wants to make a documentary about MH17 they may not be able to use the word 'MH17' or may have to pay the company for the right to use it.

The mysterious business is registered to an address in an apartment block in Kuala Lumpur but they also have a post office box at the Australia Fair shopping centre on Queensland's Gold Coast.

The people behind the company are not named, they do not have a website and no contact details are available for them.

A spokesperson for the Trade Mark Office, IP Australia, told Daily Mail Australia: 'The trade marks will be examined in due course'.

'Prior to that examination we are unable to say whether it will be accepted or not. However, there is provision within the Trade Marks Act to object to marks which are considered  "scandalous", they fall under s42(a) of the Trade Marks Act,' they said.

It typically takes approximately 4-8 weeks for a trade mark to be examined.

'If it were to be accepted for registration, any interested third party can oppose its acceptance. If a trade mark is registered it means that the registered owner of the mark has proprietary rights to use as a trade mark for the goods and or/services claimed, this does necessarily preclude others from using or referring to the term outside the parameters of the trade mark,' the spokesperson added.

Asked whether they often received applications for trade marks based around disaster events, they explained 'it is not a common occurrence for these types of marks to be filed, but it can occur'.

A Malaysia Airlines spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they are trying to block the application by also applying to trade mark the name.

'Malaysia Airlines has started the process of filing the trademark over "MH17". The purpose is to ensure no party takes advantage of the tragedy for their personal gains,' they said.

Sadly this is not the first trade mark application for the word 'MH17'.

A Belize based company named incorporated Seyefull Investments Ltd has applied to the European Trade Mark and Design Network website to trademark 'MH17' in Europe, Digital News Asia reports.

A corporate lawyer told the website that the most obvious reason why one would want to register 'MH17' is probably due to the potential of movies or books being made around the event.

'However, one should also question whether they infringe the rights owned by Malaysia Airlines in applying to register such a mark in the first place.

'Usually, the Registrar would not allow registration should it feel that this infringes the existing rights of another party. MAS still retains the common law proprietary rights in the mark,' she said.

A trade mark registration initially lasts 10 years from the date the application is filed. It can also be renewed indefinitely by paying renewal fees.

Earlier this week it was revealed the names and photos of Australian MH17 plane crash victims are being exploited by online scammers who have set up fake Facebook tribute pages to drive traffic to a dodgy external website.

The Facebook pages, created on the day the plane crashed, baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the MH17 disaster.

'Video Camera Caught the moment plane MH17 Crash over Ukraine.Watch here the video of Crash,' the link read.

Scammers have created fake Facebook accounts for MH17 victims, including the three young Perth children who died with their grandfather

Victims targeted by the scam include young Perth siblings Otis, Evie and Mo Maslin, Canberra woman Liliane Derden and Fatima Dyczynski, who was born in Germany but was on flight MH17 because she was moving to Perth.

The scam also exploited the names of victims from other countries, including Quinn Lucas Schansman from the US, British-born Kiwi Rob Ayley, Malaysia Airlines pilot Eugene Choo Jin Leong  and Richard Mayne, Ben Pocock and Liam Sweeney from the UK.

Facebook has taken down the pages but the external site goalshighlights.com remains live. It was registered in Bucharest, Romania in 2010 and the ISP address tracks back to the Netherlands.

Ken Gamble, chairman of the Australian chapter of the International Association of Cybercrime Prevention, said it looked like the website had been hacked in order to divert to adult hook up websites and others selling counterfeit drugs.

Online fraud experts said the pages were in poor taste but would only be forcibly removed by Facebook if they were criminal

'I've seen this quite a lot, hackers get in, take control of a site and they then divert to a stack of stuff and use the bandwidth of this guy's website sometimes for illegal purpose sometimes or for getting the hits up on certain sites,' Mr Gamble said.

He added that the websites that goalshighlights.com diverted to contained malicious files that would infect a user's computer if clicked on.

Mr Gamble added that fraudsters often capitalised on disasters like the MH17 crash.

'When a disaster like this happens it's a great opportunity for all sorts of scammers,' Mr Gamble told Daily Mail Australia.

'Everybody is out there looking for information at the moment, everyone wants to know more about what's happened.

'It's a great opportunity to prey on people's vulnerabilities and emotion is the greatest one.'

Scammers aim to lure a portion of the high amount of internet traffic going to websites with MH17 information, Mr Gamble said.

'Some people will be using it for an opportunity to market their sites, it's a good way to bring a massive amount of traffic to someone's site,' he said.

'Other offenders will be doing this for more sinister purposes.'

Before the Facebook pages were removed users expressed outrage, labelling them 'disgusting' and the person who created them a 'sicko'.

Others reported the pages to Facebook as spam in the hope of getting them taken down.

But some Facebook users did not realise the pages were fake, posting heartfelt messages to the page.

'Incredible, terrible...To lose your kids in this way...Such beautiful lovely children...no words...' one person wrote on the page of Mo Maslin.

'We pray for all the Australian people, especially the children god will take care of them in his safe hands let the stars shine bright for u so u know that ur not alone,' another person posted.

A spokesman for Facebook said: 'We are disabling these profiles as soon as we are made aware of them.

'We encourage people to block those responsible and report suspicious behaviour to our team of experts via our reporting buttons so that we can quickly take the appropriate action.'
