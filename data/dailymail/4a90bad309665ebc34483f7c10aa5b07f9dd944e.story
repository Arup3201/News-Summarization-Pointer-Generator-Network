Paul Lambert will not walk away from Aston Villa even if he is told to work within the same cash restrictions as the past two seasons.

American owner Randy Lerner is set to make a statement regarding his intentions for the club next week and that should clear up Lambert’s position as manager.

The Scot insists he is in the dark over his future, which would come under great scrutiny if a new owner arrived, and admitted it will be a ‘relief’ when Lerner clarifies matters.

Lambert has consistently said big money is required to lift Villa out of the doldrums but asked if he would resign in the face of further belt-tightening, he said: ‘No. It has never crossed my mind.

‘It probably will be a relief when Randy says what he is going to say. I think everything would become clear.

‘My job is to protect everything here and I’ve achieved that – nobody can take that away from me. It will catch you some time. Nobody wants be in that position.’
