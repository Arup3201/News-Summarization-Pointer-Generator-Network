Police are investigating after photos of New Year's Eve in Newcastle showed a woman being punched in the face by a violent yob.

The pictures, taken in the city's notorious Bigg Market area, show a row breaking out between revellers shortly after midnight on an evening in which drunken fun led to fighting in many towns and cities.

After the argument became  heated, a man in a suit throws a punch at one of the women, as another woman tries to hold him back. A later photo then shows the victim trying to find medical help as blood streams down her face.
