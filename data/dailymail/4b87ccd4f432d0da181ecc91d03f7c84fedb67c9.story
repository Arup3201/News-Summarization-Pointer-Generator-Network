It was a sight that must rank among the more unlikely in cricket history. There was Andrew Flintoff trotting out at the Gabba to join the England team for the first time since limping into Ashes immortality at the Oval almost six years ago.

Back then any thoughts of a comeback, let alone an appearance in an England shirt, were outlandish for an iconic figure whose body gave up on him during that 2009 summer when he left the field for the final time as an Ashes winner.

Yet there he was on Sunday, larger than life, back training among a new generation of England players, many of whom would have grown up watching him at his peak when the fabled 2005 Ashes gripped the nation.

It will not lead to a playing return for his country, of course, and Flintoff restricted himself to barely half an hour’s bowling at just Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes during his day back with the England team at Peter Moores invitation.

But if this is to be the end of Flintoff’s sojourn back into the game – and he has hinted that he may not return to Lancashire this summer after finishing his Big Bash stint with Brisbane – then it was not the worst way to bow out.

England intended Flintoff’s day among them to be a low-key affair and the first of a number of visits from past greats aimed, as is the wont of Australia under Darren Lehmann, at encouraging a bit of star dust to rub off on the team.

But such is the enduring appeal of the man known as Freddie that all eyes were on him as he donned mitts to assist with a boxing training exercise and then took up his position at the back of the nets, passing on advice to England’s bowlers.

‘I’m just here as a net bowler,’ said Flintoff, as he declined an invitation to talk about how he came to be back in England’s colours and it was left to Moores, who worked with Freddie during his first stint as England coach, to explain.

‘It’s nice to get players who have been brilliant with England back among the squad,’ said Moores. ‘The game has moved on but it has also stayed the same in many ways and it was just great to have Freddie around.

‘This squad are very keen to connect with some of those who have been there and done it with England because it can only help them.’

Flintoff restricted himself to chatting with the likes of Jordan and bowling coach David Saker at first during net practice while Jimmy Anderson went through an extended bowling session that appeared to confirm his fitness for Tuesday’s tri-series match here against India.

But the man who has made only a modest impact with a Brisbane Heat team who have now been knocked out of this year’s Big Bash could not resist a bit of a trundle after passing on some advice to Steven Finn, who looked a detached figure and seems sure to be the bowler to miss out when Anderson returns.

Flintoff beat the edge of Jordan’s bat a couple of times and was also respected by Woakes when he had a net before an extended England training session came to an end in Brisbane’s sweltering heat.

He joined the team at a barbeque here last night before rejoining his family on the Gold Coast where Flintoff has based himself while making a very positive impression – perhaps more off-field than on it – on the Big Bash.

The England players seemed to enjoy having Flintoff among them and Freddie certainly seemed to enjoy it himself. It was certainly nice for all concerned while it lasted.
