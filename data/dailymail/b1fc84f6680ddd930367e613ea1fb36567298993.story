The owners of Sammy The Cocker Spaniel whose hair was so matted he couldn't walk were sentenced to six months jail yesterday.

New Jersey's Keith Morgan, 56, and 
Shauna Ewing Morgan, 43, were also ordered to pay $13,500 in restitution and were banned from ever owning another pet.

The couple was charged with animal cruelty in March after Keith Morgan handed the severely abused 17-year-old dog to an animal shelter, saying he'd found him on the roadside. Police later learned the pair were the dog's owners.

Inhumane treatment: Sammy couldn't walk when he arrived at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital because his fur had become so matted

Neglect: Sammy, short for Samurai, had to be fed by the vets because he was so malnourished

Municipal Court Judge Robert M. LePore said he issued the maximum sentence to deter future animal abuse, according to Asbury Park Press.

'The lack of care in this case is inexcusable. There has to be a deterrent to animal cruelty,' he said.

'This court believes that a message 
needs to be sent not just to these defendants, but to all of society 
that animal cruelty is a national and global problem and must be 
addressed and deterred.'

On March 14, Keith Morgan took Sammy to the Associated Humane Societies in Tinton Falls, claiming he saw a driver dump the dog in a plastic bag on Wall Rd. 

Sammy was malnourished and he couldn't walk because his matted coat was covered in urine and feces.

For 24 hours, Keith Morgan was touted as a hero after giving a television interview about how he found the dog.

But the next day, police learned from a source the couple had owned Sammy for at least nine years.

They charged the Morgans with animal cruelty as Sammy recovered at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital in Tinton Falls. A foster family has cared for the poor pooch since April.

Animal lovers, who have been advocating for tougher sentences for animal abusers, cheered in court when the Morgans were sentenced for neglecting Sammy the dog

The tortured tale of Sammy, short for Samurai, attracted world-wide attention, with animal lovers setting up a Facebook page and Buzzfeed reporters creating a post in his honor.

An online petition calling on 
prosecutors to ask for the maximum sentence for the Brick couple 
received nearly 33,000 signatures.

More than 100 Sammy supporters, wearing T-shirts with the dog's picture, cheered in court when the couple were sentenced, even though the couple apologized for their actions.

Keith Morgan said his poor judgement stemmed from his health issues, which included diabetes, kidney disease and depression. He said he was suicidal at one point. 

'I
 was in a bad time in my life. I was depressed … because my wife left,'  
Keith Morgan said, according to NJ.com. 'I apologize, I didn’t mean for this to happen.'

Shauna Morgan said she wasn’t 
at the home for several months before the incident.

'I
 should have foreseen that Sammy wouldn’t have been safe with my 
husband, but I didn’t know he was going to get so sick. … If I had 
foreseen it I would have taken Sammy with me,' she said. 'I’m sorry it turned out the way it did.'

The couple had another dog named Ady who was reportedly in good condition. He is in a foster home.

The Morgans intend to appeal the sentence which included a $1,000 fine, $13,500 in restitution to Red Bank Veterinary Hospital, and 30 days community service, in addition to jail time.

The judge granted a motion for a stay to allow the Morgans to remain free for the appeal process.

'This is what we wanted, this is what
 was deserved and it was justified,' Monmouth County SPCA Chief Victor 
Amato said. 'This judge did the right thing.'

The
 high-profile case has sparked outrage in the small community who have 
called for 'stricter abuse laws in all states and a national registry so
 abusers can't get their hands on innocent animals,' according to the Facebook page.

When the Morgans were arraigned on May 20, more than 250 people packed the Brick municipal courtroom to watch.

A
 line stretched out the door of the courthouse with supporters wearing 
t-shirts and holding signs demanding justice, according to NJ.com.

During
 a July 15 hearing, which drew about 150 Sammy supporters, a New York 
woman yelled out 'Go kill yourself' and was escorted out of the 
courtroom.

The Morgans were escorted out of the courtroom by police yesterday.

Little Sammy has recovered fully and has been cared for by a foster family since April
