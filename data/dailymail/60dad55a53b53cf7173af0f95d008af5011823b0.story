Apple will never hit the heights it did under Steve Jobs and is set for a grim and steady decline says the man who knew him best.

Oracle CEO and America's third richest man, Larry Ellison told CBS News that without the guiding force of the mercurial Jobs, Apple will 'not be nearly so successful because he's gone.'

Best friends for a quarter of a century with Jobs, who passed away in October 2011, Ellison, who is worth $43 billion, said that ultimately the Apple chief was 'irreplaceable.'

Candid: Larry Ellison made it plain that Apple would struggle without Steve Jobs and he expected them to decline in an interview with CBS News

Labeling Jobs as an 'incredible inventor' and 'our Edison, our Picasso', Ellison, 68, said that despite the caliber of people still at the Cupertino, California firm, the company is still likely to decline without its co-founder.

'I'm not shorting Apple. I like Tim Cook. I think there are a lot of talented people there...but Steve is irreplaceable,' said Ellison to CBS News.

During the course of the wide ranging interview with Charlie Rose, Ellison described his friends battle with cancer.

'We'd always go for walks. And the walks just kept getting shorter,' said Ellison to CBS News.

'Until near the end we'd kind of walk around the block or maybe - maybe four blocks, something like that.

'And you just watched him getting weaker. And this is the strongest guy I knew. This was absolutely the strongest, most willful person I have ever met.'

Struggles Ahead: Larry Ellison said that current CEO Tim Cook is talented but unfortunately for him Steve Jobs was 'irreplaceable'

An emotional Ellison said that in the end 'the cancer wore him out' and after almost a decade battling the disease, Jobs made the decision to end his regime of medication.

'He was just tired of fighting, tired of the pain,' said Ellison.

'And he decided, shocked Lorraine (his wife), shocked everybody that the medication was gonna stop.

'He just pulled off the meds, I think on a Saturday or a Sunday. And by the following Wednesday he was gone.'

During the interview, Ellison turned his attention to Google CEO Larry Page, 'specifically' for what the Oracle CEO believes was his decision to 'take our stuff'.

Ellison's Oracle is currently involved in a bitter legal fight with Google over programming language for the Android operating system.

'We don't compete with Google,' said Ellison. 'We don't do anything Google does. We just think they took our stuff and that was wrong.

'That's a completely separate issue...I think what they did was - was - absolutely evil.

'Larry makes the decision over there. He runs that company. And they decided, let me be very clear. When you write a program for the Android phone, you write it.

'You use the Oracle tool, Oracle Java tools, for everything. And at the very end, you press a button and said, 'Covert this to android format.'

In light of his controversial comments, Ellison clarified that he did not believe that Larry Page, known for his 'Don't Be Evil' motto, 'slipped up this one time' and added that it was the actions and not Page that were evil.

'This really bothers me,' said Ellison. 'I don't know how he thinks you can just copy someone else's stuff. It really bothers me.'

When asked about whistleblower Edward Snowden and his online security and government surveillance revelations, Ellison said that these NSA programs were 'great' and 'essential'.

'By the way, President Obama thinks it's essential,' Ellison said to CBS News.

'It's essential if we want to minimize the kind of strikes that we just had in Boston. It's absolutely essential'.

Indeed, Ellison's comments on Apple came just three weeks after the Californian firm was overtaken by Samsung to become the world's most profitable mobile phone company.

Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lackluster’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts.

Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year.

The South Korea-based electronics giant, also the world’s biggest TV company, made 27.7 per cent of all phones sold during the quarter.

Apple’s iPhone was said to be ‘underperforming’ with an estimated operating profit of £3billion according to research firm Strategy Analytics.

In the past, while selling fewer phones, the more expensive iPhone has kept Apple’s profits ahead of competitors’.

But with no new products to do battle with Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S4, Apple finally lost its crown.

Neil Shah, of Strategy Analytics, said: ‘With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, Samsung has finally succeeded in becoming the handset industry’s largest and most profitable vendor.’

However, experts say Apple could overtake Samsung again when it launches its next iPhone model.
