A British accountant and internationally-known marathon runner was
battered with a brick during a mugging in New York that was a throwback to the
city’s violent past.

Andrew Billington was hit twice in the head by the attacker who
set upon him after a concert as he was walking with his girlfriend, who
witnessed the horror. The mugger then rifled through his pockets but fled empty handed.

Mr Billington, 37, was rushed to hospital in critical condition
but is now conscious and is recovering on an intensive care ward.

From his hospital bed he told the New York Daily News that he
could not remember anything about the attack on Saturday night.

He was extremely groggy and it may be months before he is able to
return to running, which is his passion and has taken him all over the world.

Mr Billington has two black eyes, his neck is in a brace, his head
is wrapped in bandages and he had an IV attached to his arm.

Michael Rabin, vice president of the New York Flyers running club,
of which Billington is a member, said: ‘I’m horrified to hear about this.

‘He’s an amazingly great guy, a wonderful person.

‘He’s an avid race runner, really speedy. He’s competed in
international marathons.’

Mr Billington is originally thought to have come from Harrogate
and attended Newcastle University.

He moved to New York in 2009, according to a post on his page for
Big Apple Brits, an ex-pat group.

He lives on the Upper West Side and is an accountant at media firm
Thomson Reuters.

Mr Billington was walking along W 58th St in New York when he was attacked in front of his girlfriend

Mr Billington is being treated at New York's Bellevue Hospital following the Saturday attack

On Saturday Mr Billington and his girlfriend, who has not been
named, went to see the Stereophonics at Terminal 5, a music venue in Manhattan.

The mugger, who is believed to be a homeless man, crept up from
behind the couple and hit Mr Billington with what appeared to be a brick
wrapped in cloth.

He then hit him again in the face, leaving him covered in blood,
and went through his pockets.

The attacker was wearing a baseball cap and a jacket or a hoodie.
Police have released a CCTV image of him and are appealing for witnesses.

Police in New York are still trying to find the attacker.

He is described as black or Hispanic and was wearing a hooded top and a baseball cap. He is believed to be homeless.

The accountant and his girlfriend had just watched Welsh rock band Sterophonics when he was attacked

Mr Billington’s recovery could prove the worst part of his ordeal
if it keeps him from competing in marathons.

On his Facebook page he has posted picture of him smiling with joy
as he runs in the snow in Central park, running in Tokyo and on holiday in Hong
Kong.

In May he finished an 18-mile race called the New York Road
Runners Marathon Tune-Up in a speedy 2 hours, 11 minutes and 19 seconds.

Mr Billington’s assault comes just weeks after a British tourist
lost a leg after being run over by a taxi in New York whilst on holiday.

Sian Green, 24, from Leicester, had her left leg was severed below
the knee as she sat eating a hot dog by the Rockefeller Centre when the cab
careered out of control.

A spokesman for Thomson Reuters would only confirm that Mr
Billington works at the company.
