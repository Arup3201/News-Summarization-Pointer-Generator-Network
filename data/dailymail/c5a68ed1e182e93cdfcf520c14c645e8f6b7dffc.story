Stuart Pearce was serenaded with a chorus of ‘Psycho’ from adoring Nottingham Forest fans as his return to the City Ground finished in a comfortable victory over ramshackle Blackpool.

Michail Antonio and Chris Burke scored the first-half goals that made this afternoon bathed in sunshine a walk in the park against a team able to name a squad of only 15 players.

In an humiliating indictment of all that is wrong at Blackpool, brought about by a chairman in Karl Oyston who appears averse to opening his wallet and a manager in Jose Riga who refused to budge on transfer targets, only one outfield player with senior experience was named on the bench.

Irate Blackpool fans chanted ‘We want Oyston out,’ before kick-off as his shambolic reign revealed its consequences with Riga’s team selection. The Belgian named only four substitutes, two of whom, in Mark Waddington and Dominic Telford, were teenagers promoted from the youth team with no senior matches.

Only Charles Dunne, a 21-year-old defender with 50 league games to his name at Wycombe, offered Riga an outfield option with any experience. In the end Telford did make his debut late on.

All this despite a flurry of transfer activity since it became clear a fortnight ago that having eight players on the books would be suicidal. Riga was hampered yesterday by having seven players out, two through work permit issues, while striker Ishmael Miller, released by Forest this summer, was not registered in time despite signing on Wednesday. Commendably, Miller decided to watch the match from the stands with his fans. It would be laughable were it not so serious.

It meant nine debutants for the visitors, all signed for nothing or on loan. Captain Tony McMahon is a player who only signed in January. The Seasiders are a club built on foundations of sand right now.

Pearce named six debutants himself, although these were players bought for significant fees with a tilt at promotion to the Premier League in mind. Britt Assombalonga cost a club-record £5million fee. It is doubtful that much has been spent by Oyston on recruitment since Blackpool fell from the top-flight in 2011, pocketing more than £70m in parachute payments in the process.

These clubs do share a common theme of course; Pearce has not seen eye-to-eye with his hierarchy either. The manager who runs a mile from a euphemism, went public when Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles were sold to Newcastle behind his back this week.

But he subsequently clarified that his issue was less with Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi and more the financial people for failing to keep him informed. Forest got £7m and both players loaned back for the season. ‘Very good business,’ Pearce concluded. Darlow started this match in goal. What Riga would do for such problems.

Amid such circumstances, a 2-0 defeat for Blackpool is not an embarrassment. They were surprisingly well-organised and stifled Forest for decent periods. Indeed, the first clear chance went their way when John Lundstram’s inswinging free-kick found the head of Nathan Delfouneso. But the former Aston Villa man put it wide with the goal at his mercy.

Forest’s quality and preparation told in the end, and Pearce will be warmed two of his summer signings scored the goals.

In the 25th minute Andy Reid advanced will the ball and unleashed a trademark strike from ards that clipped the inside of the post with Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis stranded. Antonio, signed for £1.5m this week from Sheffield Wednesday, arrived at the perfect moment to slot home the rebound. Pearce, a legendary figure here after 12 years as a player, celebrated with a fist-pump.

Five minutes later the tally was doubled. Burke, who moved from Birmingham on a free, cut in from the right and curled a delicious strike from the angle of the area that flew into the far corner.

‘Psycho, give us a wave,’ the jubilant home fans chanted. He duly obliged.

Antonio could have added another but his shot, after excellent work from Matty Fryatt, was held by Lewis and after the break Assombalonga did everything but score. His pace offered Forest an outlet from the back and his presence a focal point for crosses into the box.

Blackpool, an assorted bunch who were mostly strangers to each other before the past week, kept their shape admirably and Lundstram went close with a shot curled round the post.

But as the match ebbed away the travelling contingent once more chanted: ‘We want Oyston out’. The Blackpool chairman could not hear, he was not in attendance – rumoured to be abroad in even sunnier surroundings.
