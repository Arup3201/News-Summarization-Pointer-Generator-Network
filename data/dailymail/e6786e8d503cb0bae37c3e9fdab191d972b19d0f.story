The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association has submitted an application for snooker to be included as an Olympic sport in time for Tokyo 2022.

There is space for one new sport at the games in Japan, and WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson has cited snooker's wide-reaching appeal as the reason it should be added to the list of sports.

'It has been our belief for some time that we should be given our chance on the ultimate global platform for sport,' Ferguson told the BBC. 

Snooker bidding to become an approved Olympic sport in time for Tokyo 2022 games

'Snooker alone is watched by nearly half a billion people worldwide and played competitively in over 90 countries.' 

The International Olympic Committee has already agreed on the list of sports for the 2022 games, but there is room for one more.

However, due to its popularity in Japan, baseball is considered the favourite to take the final spot.
