The BBC has given Eurovision hopeful Engelbert Humperdinck another reason to worry about receiving nul points on Saturday night after 'ambushing' him for a news programme.

The crooner, who hopes to lead Britain to victory next weekend in the competition screened by the BBC, was furious after being confronted about host nation Azerbaijan's human rights record.

Mr Humperdinck, 76, was approached by Panorama's Paul Kenyon after an interview with Radio 2 in a BBC recording studio.

'Ambushed': Eurovision hopeful Engelbert Humperdinck was said to be incensed after being cornered by the BBC's Panorama over host nation Azerbijan

He was asked why he was taking part in the competition and what his views on human rights in the country.

Mr Kenyon then presented him with a T-shirt that bore the slogan: 'Please Release Them', a play on Mr Humperdinck's well known hit Please Release Me and political prisoners held in the Soviet state.

The singer, who will belt out Love Will Set You Free during the competition next weekend, stayed calm and smiled. But he and his entourage were said to be incensed by the incident.

In an email to Mr Kenyon seen by the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Humperdinck's agent Chris Hewlett said: 'I wanted to make very clear how surprised and disappointed we all were that Panorama felt it appropriate to ambush Engelbert on BBC property in order to force a reaction from him, without even giving him the courtesy of time to frame his thoughts.

'Mafia state': President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev is said to run a 'mafia state' in which journalists who go against the regime will be jailed or blackmailed

'Eurovision is a BBC show, and he was invited by the BBC to participate, and we feel that these actions by another BBC team were at best ill-judged.'

A Panorama spokesman said: 'We’re satisfied that we’ve acted fairly and followed our editorial guidelines.'

The scene will be shown in tonight's 'Eurovision’s Dirty Secret' episode despite pleas from inside the BBC to cut it out.

Mr Kenyon went undercover in Azerbaijan to uncover the corruption surrounding the singing contest in the Soviet state.

The programme tells of residents who were held and questioned after last year's show simply for voting for neighbouring country - and bitter rival - Armenia.

Mr Kenyon also found that blocks of flats, knocked down to make room for the impressive 20,000-seat Baku Crystal Hall where the event takes place, still had residents inside when the bulldozers rumbled in.

President Ilham Aliyev is said to run a 'mafia state' in which journalists who go against the regime will be jailed or blackmailed.
