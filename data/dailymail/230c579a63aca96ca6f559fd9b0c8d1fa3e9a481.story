Nintendo has unveiled a new 'Miiverse' social network which will work with its upcoming Wii U consoles - and revealed that the service will also work on mobiles.

The news marks a major turnaround for the company, which has never made games for devices from other companies in the past.

Nintendo has been slow to adopt online gaming, but is building the service into its upcoming Wii U to compete with rivals such as Apple.

The success of smartphones such as Apple's iPhone has been seen as key to Nintendo's declining profits - the company posted its first-ever annual loss this year.

Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops in Europe, Japan and America by the end of 2012.

The new Wii U console is said to be 
twice as powerful as Xbox 360, according to the latest rumours, and 
features a tablet-style controller with a built-in screen.

The new online 'world' Miiverse brings Nintendo into line with console rivals Sony and Microsoft, both of whom offer online services via their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.

‘Nintendo is falling behind its rivals in the online gaming
area. The idea of entering the field is good, but the question is whether the
company can generate profits,’ said Hajime Nakajima, a wholesale trader at Iwai
Cosmo Securities.             

Debuted a year ago, the much anticipated Wii U console has
so far received a frosty reception from investors worried that the hardware
will struggle to find buyers in a $78.5 billion industry that has become a
target for smartphone and tablet PC makers such as Apple.  

The new Nintendo Wii U gaming console is displayed on a video screen during a news conference at the E3 Gaming Convention in Los Angeles last year - full details are widely expected to be revealed at this year's show

The 'second screen' now also sports classic dual-joystick controls, hinting that Nintendo may be hunting the hardcore gamer market with their new console

Nintendo's hi-tech new Wii U console is likely to be much more expensive than the previous incarnation, say analysts - and many see the HD machine as a 'last chance'.

Nintendo may disclose the price
and launch date of the Wii U at the event.  

Nintendo may have to sell the new console for as much as
$350 to break even, reckons Nanako Imazu, an analyst for CLSA in Tokyo. That's
$100 more than it charged for the Wii in 2006 and would be more expensive than
both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which can be picked up for less than $300.      

Nintendo shares dropped by as much as 3.2 percent early on
Monday - to their lowest since November 2003. After revealing the Wii U a year ago, Nintendo stock has
more than halved, and is currently well below its level when the Wii was first
launched in 2006.   

‘The market has begun to discount the possibility that the
situation is going to get worse after this year's E3,’ Mizuho Securities
analyst Takeshi Koyama said before Iwata's broadcast.             

Nintendo, which last year launched the 3DS handheld games
machine, reported a first-ever operating loss, of 37.3 billion yen ($477
million), in the year to end-March - a reverse that Iwata in April admitted was
under par for Nintendo.             

‘Some people may wonder if Wii U is a simple evolution of
Wii or something completely different. I think maybe the best answer is both,’
Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said in a webcast ahead of the E3 videogame
industry trade show in Los Angeles where he will unveil the final version of
the Wii U.         

The addition of Miiverse suggests Nintendo - which started
out in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto before gaining
prominence as the creator of the ‘Super Mario’ franchise - may be relying on
online content delivery to underpin hardware sales through its new Nintendo
Network, a similar strategy to Sony and Apple.         

However, Iwata has been slower than others to take on online
social and content delivery platforms, and has a lot of ground to make up to
catch up with the millions of subscribers plugged into PlayStation 3's network,
iTunes and Microsoft's Xbox.   

In his webcast, Iwata showed off a video chat function and
functions to allow users to message and share pictures and other content. ‘Not
only can it connect people in a better way within the same living room, but it
also connects people (from) living room to living room in a much more
compelling way,’ he said.          

The Nintendo boss promised that Miiverse in the future would
be made available to subscribers on smartphones and other mobile devices, a
first tentative step by Nintendo to offer services on devices built by other
companies.              

In a more traditional hardware bid to attract consumers,
Iwata said the Wii U's tablet touchscreen controller would come with a built-in
joystick, called a GamePad, that would double as a TV remote, while a pro
controller for the games machine would be available for hardcore gamers.             

‘All these things sound like they're playing catch-up to the
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,’ Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities,
said after Iwata's webcast.
