A 20-foot-wide sinkhole has swallowed the driveway belonging to an elderly Florida woman - and neighbors fear it could take her house, too.

The elderly resident of the house in Pasco County was able to escape with her two cats, but her car is still trapped in the garage.

There's no way to get it out with a five-foot deep hole directly in front of the door.

WTSP-TV reports that firefighters evacuated several of the woman's neighbors - fearing the hole could grow and consume their homes as well.

In too deep: This poor Florida woman had to flee her home after her driveway was sucked in by a sinkhole

Firefighters evacuated her neighbors, as well, for fear that ground could be unstable at their homes, as well

In March, a 36-year-old man died outside Tampa when a sinkhole opened under his bed and sucked him under.

If the sinkhole doesn't grow and damaged her house, the woman will likely be stuck to foot the entire bill to repair her driveway.

A Florida law ensures that homeowners' insurance only covers damage to the home itself - not to the surrounding property damaged by sinkholes.

Sinkhole can be fairly common in the central parts of the Sunshine State.

'I could not believe it until I saw it with my own eyes,' neighbor Joy Zupancic told WTSP.

The woman's neighbors have returned - but not without their fair share of unease.

'If you had a sinkhole, you would be worried to. We don't want it to grow,' George Kimball, who lives next door to the hole, said.

Sinkholes like those often seen in Florida are caused by acidic water eroding the limestone be beneath the soil.

Because of the geological makeup of the Sunshine State, certain areas are more prone to this phenomenon.
