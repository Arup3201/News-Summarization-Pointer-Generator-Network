David Cameron has agreed to debate with Ukip leader Nigel Farage ahead of the general election.

The prime minister has been dogged by criticism for months as he repeatedly ignored calls to go head-to-head with his political rival.

Finally, he has conceded to one televised debate featuring Farage, as well as Labour leader Ed Miliband, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, and the Green party leader Natalie Bennett.

Conceded: David Cameron has finally accepted a potential debate format featuring Ukip leader Nigel Farage

But voters will have to wait until October, after party conference season, for his aides to decide on a satisfactory format, sources claim.

The revelation comes eight months after the Conservative leader told Andrew Marr he did not believe Nigel Farage should be allowed to join the three leaders' in a general election debate.

He told the BBC interviewer: 'I think the debates predominantly should be about people who have a prospect of becoming Prime Minister.'

Marr replied: 'And you think that Nigel Farage is not going to be our next Prime Minister?'

'I don't think so, no,' laughed Cameron.

As the least known leader at the three, Lib Dems' Mr Clegg was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates against Labour PM Gordon Brown and Cameron, with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels

His remarks sparked a wave of criticism, as Ukip gain momentum, swinging Tory voters with their stance on Europe.

Today, in a dramatic turnaround, sources close to the prime minister told The Sunday Times he will now 'consider' a format featuring the Ukip leader.

'We are prepared to consider a range of possible line-ups including Nigel Farage,' a source told the paper.

'We're open to debates. We're just not going to start negotiating now.'

Addition: Sources close to Cameron claim he will only face up to Nigel Farage in a televised debate if Green Party leader Natalie Bennett is also on the panel

Cameron notoriously lost out to his Coalition partner Nick Clegg in the first TV debates ahead of the 2010 general election.

As the least known leader at the three, Lib Dems' Mr Clegg was seen as the big 
winner of the first of the three debates against Labour PM Gordon Brown and Cameron, with his poll ratings 
rocketing to record levels.

Since taking office, the prime minister has made clear he found the debates to be a distraction to the election.

But in recent months, Cameron has come under increasing pressure to agree to a debate.

In
 January, Farage - who is wooing the Tory Right with his strict 
anti-immigration campaign - began threatening to broadcast a rival show 
to voters if Cameron excludes Ukip from the debates.

He
 told the BBC’s Daily Politics: ‘Politics has changed a lot since 2010. 
We’ve seen radical change in Scottish politics in the last decade, in 
Northern Irish politics and English politics is going through a big 
change.

‘I remember in 2009, when Ukip came second in the euro 
elections, being told it can never happen in domestic politics and in 
this year’s English county elections, we got nearly a quarter of the 
vote.

‘The point is, Ukip is now a significant force in British 
politics; we’re polling double what the Lib Dems are and I think 
frankly, to exclude Ukip from these debates would probably give us the 
benefit of the underdog because it would look like the political class 
closing ranks on itself.’
