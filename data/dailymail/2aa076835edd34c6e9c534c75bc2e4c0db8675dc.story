A newlywed was blinded when a piece of metal flew into his eye while watching a mock sword fight on his honeymoon, court papers claim.

Dustin Wiseman, 37, and his wife Melissa, 38, had front-row seats for a medieval show when a shard from a titanium sword allegedly struck him in the face.

The South Dakota couple have now filed a $10million lawsuit alleging that Buena Park dinner theatre company Medieval Times failed to take proper safety measures to protect its clients.

They also claim it ruined their honeymoon in April 2011 and had given them a difficult start to married life as Mrs Wisemen has now gone from newlywed to carer.

According to KTLA.com, their attorney, Jason Fowler, said: 'The only thing they actually did was go to the beach, then go to Medieval Times and go to the hospital.'

He said the couple had been persuaded to buy the VIP tickets and that they had not been reimbursed for any of Mr Wiseman's medical expenses.

He added: 'Heâ€™s undergone at least three surgeries and still is legally blind, essentially, in his left eye.'

According to the Medieval Times website, the one of its packages encourages customers to 'surrender to an age of bravery and honor and witness epic battles of steel and steed during our ALL-NEW SHOW.

'From ringside seats, discover a feast of the eyes and appetite with more action, more fun and more excitement than ever before.

'As you thrill to a rousing live jousting tournament, marvel at awe-inspiring horsemanship and falconry, Medieval Times serves a four-course meal fit for royalty.'

An attorney with Medieval Times said the law firm does not comment on pending litigation.
