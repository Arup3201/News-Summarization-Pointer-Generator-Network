From wonderful waterfalls to figures trudging through the snow this stunning collection of pictures show the beauty and ferocity of nature.

They were all finalists in the Great Outdoors photography competition, which was won with a shot of a camel herder entitled Homebound by Indian Times photographer Sudipto Das, from West Bengal.

It shows a camel seller leaving a fairground with unsold camels after the 
world's biggest camel fair is over at Pushkar in Rajasthan. Camel sellers
 from remote villages in Rajasthan gather at the fairground yearly to 
trade camels which continues for seven day.

Second prize went to Brit mountain guide Andy Teasdale, from Gwynedd, north-west Wales, for his picture of four skiers battling through the snow on Gran Paradiso in the Italian Alps.
