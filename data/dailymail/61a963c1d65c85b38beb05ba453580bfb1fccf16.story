Could be you: A lucky ticket holder won $105million in the Virginia Lottery, but has not yet come forward

Someone has won $105million, but they might not know it yet.

So if you bought a lotto ticket in Virginia recently, check those numbers!

Lottery officials say a single ticket matching all six numbers in this week's Mega Millions jackpot was purchased in Virginia, and is now worth a cool $105million.

Those winning numbers, from Friday's drawing, are: 12, 17, 30, 35, 47, and mega ball number 26.

The winning ticket was purchased at a Giant Food store in Herndon, Virginia, according to the Virginia Lottery's website.

That's good news for the store, which will get a $50,000 bonus, plus a boost in publicity.

The holder of the winning ticket - whoever he or she may be - could opt to take the jackpot in 26 annual payments or a single cash option of an estimated $68.1million.

In either case, it is one of the biggest lotto winnings in the U.S. this year.

Mega Millions is the biggest jackpot game in the country, and is played in 41 states plus Washington, D.C.

In March, several New York state government workers split a $319 Mega Millions payout.

In January, two ticket holders from Washington and Idaho split $380million.

The biggest Mega Millions jackpot ever won was $390million in March 2007.

Next Tuesday's drawing is estimated to be $12million, though it will roll over to the next drawing if there is no winner.

According to the lottery's posted rules, the winner must claim their prize within 180 days of the drawing.

The Virginia Lottery boasts that it has contributed more than $5billion to education in the state over its years of operation.
