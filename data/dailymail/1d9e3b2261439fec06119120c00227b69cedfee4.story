Ian Poulter has got links golf cracked. The way to win The Open at Hoylake this week is this: 'Just don't play bad. Simple as that.' 

If only it were that easy, England could gloss over a miserable sporting summer by celebrating a homegrown winner of the Claret Jug and anticipating another Poulter tour de force at the Ryder Cup in September.

In the pink: Ian Poulter believes that The Open and The Masters offers his best chance of winning a major

But Poulter knows links golf can be brutal. He went to the famed layout at Royal Aberdeen last week with the purpose of getting 'beaten up' to prepare himself for The Open. He got just that: a second-round knockout.

Still, Poulter will pick himself up off the canvas for his latest attempt at claiming that elusive maiden major championship. No matter the missed cut in Scotland, the 38-year-old will have more than a puncher's chance at claiming the game's ultimate prize this week.

Poulter is engaging in fighting talk already, insisting that The Open, along with The Masters, represents his best chance of winning a major at long last.

'I love links golf,' he says. 'I'm looking for a big finish. I want to get my hands on that illustrious piece of silverware.'

From the moment he dared to show up in that pair of Union Jack trousers at Troon a decade ago, Poulter has often been the talk of The Open.

But since that sartorial double bogey, Poulter has also proved that when it comes to links golf he truly can wear the trousers one day (just perhaps not that particular pair).

Two top 10s in his last two Opens suggests that the man who now calls Florida home has his best chance of landing one of the game's four big prizes back across the pond. Blistering late charges through the field at Birkdale in 2008 and Muirfield last summer have led to second and third place finishes. There is one obvious leap left to take.

But what about Aberdeen last week? Rounds of 73 and 74 suggested he had not yet regained his touch playing British seaside golf.

Poulter has been here before though. Not least at Hoylake in 2006 when he missed the cut by some margin while Woods gave his masterclass in strategic tee shots (or the 'stinger' in more animalistic parlance). The lessons learned that year, playing alongside Seve Ballesteros in his final Open, and a rather harsh reminder in Scotland last week are what gives Poulter confidence in such a simple outlook for this week.

'Links golf will highlight any error,' he
 admits. 'There's nothing more to learn than understanding if you hit a 
bad shot you will be punished severely.

'There's a lot of ways to see how to play Hoylake but you have to be on every aspect of your game to compete. It depends on the weather. If we get the same conditions as 2006 everyone will be playing it the same way as Tiger. 

'You have to stay out of the bunkers. You have to make sure you're not making silly mistakes. They come from being too aggressive off the tee. It's a strategy everybody will consider.

Given the big, flat-ish greens at Hoylake, this could be a tournament won by a man with a dead-eye on the greens – Poulter's most dangerous weapon.  But is the Postman – to use his Ryder Cup nickname – ready to deliver at last in a major? 'I feel very happy with my game. I feel fit and ready, refreshed and ready to go,' he calmly asserts.

But calm is not how most English golf fans want to see him this week. Could playing in front of home support be the key to unlocking that eyes-bulging, fist pumping, American-slaying maniac? 

'It's always good to play in front of home fans, they love their golf,' he says. 'They're very partisan and passionate and they get right behind you. It's great, you can't ask for more than that. 

'There's not enough events in the UK anymore to satisfy the fans. We have so many great fans and so few tournaments. But that means when The Open comes along they get right behind their players.' 

And if there's one more way to stir that inner Ryder Cup beast, being paired with two Americans on Thursday and Friday might just do the trick. Dustin Johnson and Jimmy Walker, who are both likely to be in Tom Watson's team in Perthshire, had better watch out. The Postman is on the prowl.
