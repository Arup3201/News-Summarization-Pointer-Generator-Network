Alastair Cook hailed a near-perfect performance from England as they recorded their first Test win in almost a year.

Victory by 266 runs over India in the third Investec Test at the Ageas Bowl ended a 10-Test run without a win - a run which featured only two draws.

Cook said: 'It was a good performance right from day one, I don't think we lost a session. Every single one of the XI has contributed to a great win.

'Getting 570 (in the first innings) was a great start, then we bowled them out, got runs quickly and put pressure on them then got them out again.'

In an inexperienced line-up, the likes of Moeen Ali, Sam Robson, Gary Ballance and Chris Woakes had not tasted Test victory before.

And Cook added: 'There was a bit of a scramble for the stumps for their first win, people will remember that for a long time.'

Cook's much-needed innings of 95 in the first innings not only set the tone for big hundreds from Ballance and Ian Bell and a rapid 85 from debutant wicketkeeper Jos Buttler but eased questions over his own form.

'I said at Lord's I thought my game was heading back in the right direction and to back it up, I'm incredibly pleased,' Cook added.

All smiles: Cook looked happy for the first time in a long time as England won for the first time this year

'I was frustrated I didn't get the hundred in the first innings but to get 160 runs (in the match), I'll certainly take that.'

James Anderson was named man of the match after taking five for 53 in the first innings and seven wickets in the match, while spinner Moeen wrapped up the Indian second innings with six for 67.

'His bowling has come on leaps and bounds from the beginning of the summer,' Cook said of the Worcestershire all-rounder.

'Credit to Mo, he's worked incredibly hard.

'He's a bit part-time backing up (Saeed) Ajmal at Worcestershire but he's bowled a huge amount in the nets with the guys here.'

Regarding Buttler, he added: 'It was a brilliant debut, he came in in a brilliant situation and was very attacking, it was good to watch.

'And the good thing is nobody is talking about his keeping, he had a good game all round.'
