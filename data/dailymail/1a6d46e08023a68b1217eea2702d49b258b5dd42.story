Judging by the passengers on board this plane, it must be heading over the Misty Mountains and straight for Middle Earth.

Hobbits and elves are squashed in next to Orcs and wizards on board the cramped flight - suggesting the latest movie adaptation of a J.R.R Tolkien classic has been given a modern twist.

But Lord Of The Rings fans can breathe a sign of relief, as the scene is taken from Air New Zealand's new in-flight safety video, which even features a cameo from director Sir Peter Jackson along with one of Tolkien's most famous characters - Gollum.

The safety video was inspired by the upcoming film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the first in a trilogy of movies from director Sir Peter Jackson, who was also behind the smash hit hugely successful The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.

The Oscar-winning director even agreed to appear in the safety video along with cast members, and Mike and Royd Tolkien, the great-great grandsons of the author of timeless masterpiece The Hobbit JRR Tolkien.

The airline's general manager of marketing and communications Mike Tod said the video - called An Unexpected Briefing - was representative of the hotbed of creative talent in New Zealand.

'To have Gollum step off the movie screen for the first time and into an Air New Zealand aircraft is incredibly special, and Sir Peter Jackson delivers a superb cameo,' Mr Tod said.

'He should come out from behind the camera more often,' he added.

Royd
Tolkien, who features in the video with prosthetic hairy Hobbit feet, 
said of Air New Zealand's video: 'They’ve done a great job of 
capturing the essence of The Hobbit films and it was a privilege to be 
invited to participate.'

New Zealander Dean O’Gorman, who plays the Dwarf Fili in the movie, can also be spotted 
among the passengers in the safety video, along with two super-Hobbit 
fans from TheOneRing.net – the largest online Tolkien fan site.

Mr
Tod said the release of ‘An Unexpected Briefing’ marks the official 
start of Air New Zealand’s two-year global marketing programme dedicated
to The Hobbit trilogy.

A
forthcoming feature of Air New Zealand’s support of The Hobbit trilogy 
will be a themed aircraft which will be unveiled prior to the movie’s 
global première in Wellington on November 28.
