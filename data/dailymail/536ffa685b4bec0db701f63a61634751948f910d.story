She's one of the most famous and successful magazine editors in the world, legendary for her frosty manner, trademark bob and wearing sunglasses at all times - even during the Oscars ceremony.

But what makes American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, 65, so successful?

In an interview with Alistair Campbell for his new book Winners And How They Succeed, she shared the secrets of her success.

Anna Wintour shares the traits that have taken her to the top including being decisive and resilient

In a book extract in the Sunday Times' Style magazine, Wintour, who became American Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, reveals that being decisive, delegating and recovering fast from setbacks have taken her to the top - and kept her there.

Having been fired from her role as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar after just nine months in 1975, she said: 'Everyone should be sacked at least once in their career because 'perfection doesn't exist'.

She added: 'It's important to have setbacks, because that is the reality of life.'

The most powerful woman in fashion and editor of Vogue for almost 30 years is rumoured to have been the model for Miranda Priestly, the terrifying magazine editor who hires Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada.

But her analysis of her own strengths is far more human and surprisingly humble than the film character as she asks whether 'journalist' is even the right word to describe what she does. 

Yet her most surprising trick is pretending to be sure of herself, even if she doesn't feel it.

She said: 'It makes it clearer for everyone else. Most people prevaricate. I decide fast.'

With the nickname 'Nuclear Wintour' owing to her frosty demeanour Wintour, was made artistic director of Conde Nast by her employer in 2013 and editorial director in July 2014.

She attributes being organised and a good delegator to her success, and says there's no need to double and triple check what her staff are doing. 

'People work better when they have responsibility,' she said. 

She also revealed that she has no idea how to make a dress, couldn't create an image from a photo shoot and can't write, and instead responds to other people's talents.

Her other tips for getting to the top include getting up early - she rises at 5am everyday - and 'turning off' at the weekend.
