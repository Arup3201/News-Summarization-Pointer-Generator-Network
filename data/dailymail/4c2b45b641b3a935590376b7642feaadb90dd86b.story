Tony Blair last night gave Ed Miliband his full backing – just hours after saying he expects the Labour leader to lose the election in May.

The former prime minister sparked a backlash after an interview in which he warned the party had been dragged to the Left and is on course for disaster at the polls.

But he was forced to issue a denial within hours, saying his comments had been ‘misinterpreted’.

He added on Twitter: ‘I fully support Ed and my party and expect a Labour victory in the election.’ Charlie Whelan, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown, responded: ‘Don’t be surprised if no one believes you.’

Mr Blair had angered Labour high command after telling The Economist that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’.

Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ But his intervention was a blow to the Labour leader, who is struggling to convince his own party that he can win the election.

In a further setback yesterday, a prominent Left-winger said the party’s ruling elite looked down on working class supporters in the North.

Wansbeck MP Ian Lavery, a former miner, said: ‘We’ve got an elite in Westminster which quite frankly frightens me.

‘They haven’t been anywhere or done anything, and when you’ve got an accent like mine they think, “well that man doesn’t really know too much”.’ A Blairite former minister yesterday said it was right to raise concerns about the direction Mr Miliband is taking the party.

David Lammy said Mr Blair’s comments should be taken ‘very seriously indeed’, adding: ‘Labour has to be the party of small business, we have to be the party of enterprise and we do have to be clear that we understand that it is actually industry that is the engine of our economy and not give the impression that we are solely focused on the public sector.’

Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s election chief, yesterday dismissed the warning that Labour’s lurch to the Left had left it vulnerable to defeat. Referring to Mr Blair, she said: ‘He has his experience from his era. That is not the era we now live in.’

In the interview, Mr Blair also argued that Britain has shifted to the Right in the wake of the economic crash and said Labour succeeds best when it is in the ‘centre ground’.

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, described his views as ‘sad and disappointing’.

He added: ‘Tony Blair is now a very wealthy person sitting on top of the pile and is disconnected from the lives of ordinary people.

‘Having lost touch with ordinary people it is hardly surprising that he labels promising a decent living wage, homes for rent, decent rights at work and making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes to be vote-losing policies.’

Veteran Labour MP David Winnick said Mr Blair should remember the Clement Attlee quip ‘a period of silence on your part would be welcome’.

A Labour victory in this year’s general election would spark economic ‘chaos’, David Cameron warns today.

The Prime Minister will use his New Year message to say Labour’s addiction to borrowing poses ‘huge risks’ to an economy that is now on the mend – as experts predict wages are finally set to outstrip inflation this year.

The Institute of Directors expects pay to rise by an average of 2 to 3 per cent in the next 12 months as company balance sheets improve. Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research will today forecast that average prices could start to fall for the first time since 1960 because of the impact of cheaper oil.

In his message, Mr Cameron will say Britain’s progress is at grave risk if Ed Miliband seizes power in May – either outright or as part of a coalition government.

In a plea for a second term, he will claim the UK is being ‘turned around’ by the Tories, adding: ‘Britain has a choice between the competence that has got us this far or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.’
