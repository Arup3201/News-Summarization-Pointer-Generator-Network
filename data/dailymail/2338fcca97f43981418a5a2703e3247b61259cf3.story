Star rating: Boot's Soltan brand of sun cream displaying five stars

After seven years of letting competitors use their UVA star rating system, Boots has now banned low-price rivals from putting the universally recognised protection markings on their own-brand sun creams.

But in the shock move, Britain’s biggest chemist chain is still allowing pricier makes like Nivea and Ambre Solaire to use the protection rating system on their bottles.

The chain is now being blasted for risking the health of holidaymakers by banning the cut-price rivals from using the system.

Boots, which owns the rights to the easily-understood and widely used star system has barred own-brand rivals including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Superdrug from printing it on their products.  

And cancer experts have hit out at the Boots' decision saying that the confusion could lead to customers failing to protect themselves from the dangers of skin dancer.

Dr Russell Emerson of Hove Skin Clinic said: ‘Protecting our skin from UVA rays is equally, if not more important than protecting it from UVB rays.

‘The removal of star rating from own- brand packs could result in confusion for shoppers and could mean that they end up spending more than is necessary on expensive branded sun care.

‘It is not necessary to spend a fortune to get the right protection.

‘At a time when skin cancer rates are on the rise, it's even more important for consumers to have more, rather than less information on how to stay safe in the sun.’

Industry insiders say the ban on using the seven-year-old star system is aimed at grabbing market share back from the lower-priced competitors - on the basis families will only buy products that have the star rating which shows sun lotion protection levels from cancer-causing UVA rays.

But there are fears it will confuse shoppers who may end up paying more because it will be harder to compare rival creams.

An Asda spokesman said: ‘What is 
telling is that Boots has only banned rival stores who undercut their 
prices from using the star rating.

‘Brands
such as Nivea, Ambre Solaire, Piz Buin and so on - who presumably Boots
do not see as a threat on price - are still able to use it.

‘The
only conclusion is that Boots are scared about the threat from the 
cheaper rivals. But the people who suffer are ordinary families.

The
supermarkets have fought hard in recent years to introduce cheap 
own-brand sun creams that undercut big names such as Nivea and also 
Boots' own Soltan range.

This
star rating is as important as the sun protection factor (SPF) score 
used to measure how a cream blocks out UVB rays, according to experts.

And it has been vital in battling skin cancer.

The star ratings system was developed by an academic at Newcastle University for Boots.

It became the standard method used by sun cream makers in the UK and Ireland in 2004.

The move by Boots comes as Cancer Research UK reveals skin cancer levels have tripled since the 1970s.

Boots made the shock decision last year but rivals hoped for a u-turn.

Retailers were able to use up stock already tested and bottled but new batches without the star rating are hitting stores now.

This system consists of five different ratings, with one star indicating low levels of protection against UVA radiation, and five stars indicating a high level.

Retailers and brands have traditionally paid Boots a token fee for use of the star logo and for testing.

Superdrug are calling for an independent standard, not one regulated by a retailer and in this case a competitor

Health bosses in the USA are so impressed by its effectiveness in raising awareness about UVA rays among consumers they have been considering implementing it there.

The Asda spokesman added: ‘Sun cream is a necessity - not a luxury - and everybody should be entitled to the best sun protection available no matter what their budget.

‘It is especially important when it comes to children and their health. It's unfortunate there is a burning ambition by some to make huge profits on what is essential skin care.

‘Our customers can have the confidence they won't get burned by the cost of cream, because they can buy Asda Protect sun cream from as little as £1.50.’ 

Andrew Groom, Superdrug's Own Brand Director, said: ‘With an issue as important as skin cancer, retailers and own brand manufacturers should be working together to help customers make an informed choice.

‘We are at a loss to understand why Boots has chosen to withdraw our license for the star rating system.

‘Our own brand suncare, Solait continues to conform to the 5 star standard, yet we can't reassure our customers by using the rating system.

We are calling for an independent standard, not one regulated by a retailer and in this case a competitor.’

A spokesperson for Boots told the Mail Online today: 'Boots introduced the UVA star rating system in 1992.

'We have updated it a number of times in line with technological developments because we know how important UVA protection and the star rating system is to all consumers.

'Following a review of the star rating system and conversations with leading experts, including Cancer Research UK, we have established more robust controls to deal with past issues of non-compliance to the star rating system, so that customers can be sure that any brand using this system is doing so correctly.

'Following these conversations in May 2011, revisions have been made enabling us to make new licences available to all sun care brands shortly.'
