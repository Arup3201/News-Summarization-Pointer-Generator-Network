Accused: Paul Orchard, 33, appeared confused when officers arrived Saturday, telling them, 'I killed my wife!'

A father charged with killing his mother-in-law in front of his six-year-old daughter was sexually assaulting the victim when officers arrived at their home, according to court documents.

Paul Orchard told his own mother during a phone call that he believed he was on a 'vapor high' from fumes made by the polyurethane he was using to seal the woman's floor in the town of Peru, Maine.

Orchard, 33, appeared confused when officers arrived Saturday, telling them, 'I killed my wife!' the documents said.

Police said Orchard sexually assaulted and strangled 57-year-old Paula Nuttall at their home late Saturday morning while his wife was at work. 

Court documents said during a 911 call for help, his daughter could be heard yelling, 'Daddy, please stop it; please stop it!'

Nuttall died of cardiac arrest during strangulation and sexual assault, according to the state medical examiner's office.

Orchard told his mother that he was refinishing his mother-in-law's floor, but wasn't wearing a mask to protect from the vapors, police said. He told police that he 'lost it.' 

Lt. Daniel Carrier of the Mexico Police Department reported that Orchard was naked and covered in polyurethane - a clear wood coating - when he arrived.

Orchard was taken to Rumford Hospital because police believed that he may have ingested some of the polyurethane.

A judge on Tuesday ordered Orchard not to have any contact with his wife and daughter, who are considered witnesses. 

Orchard also was ordered held without bail pending a hearing. A message left at his lawyer's office wasn't immediately returned.
