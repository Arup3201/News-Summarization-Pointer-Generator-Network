Tabasco is keeping a hot secret and it's their version of the popular Sriracha hot sauce which they've introduced as a limited edition product only available online at their 'Country Store.'

As Sriracha maker Huy Fong Foods fights with officials in Irwindale , California over 'spicy air' emanatingÂ  from the factory, competitors are taking an opportunity to create their own version of the chili sauce while the original company fights with their factory's local community.

Sriracha owner David Tran claims he's in Irwindale to stay and has no plans of moving his $40 million 655,000-square-foot corporate headquarters but Sriracha has been disappearing from supermarket shelves as the company has had to limit production.

The Huy Fong Foods factory, maker of Sriracha hot chili sauce, has recieved from complaints from residents in Irwindale , California who say the factory makes the air too spicy

Tran says the legal battle over the factory he calls his 'loved one' reminds him of living in Vietnam, from which he escaped 35 years ago.

'Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] USA, and my feeling, the government, not a big difference,' he says.

Time reports that companies like Tabasco have decided to create their own product at a time when Huy Fong Foods is at its weakest.

Grub Street reports that Tabasco has been hush-hush about their new sauce because the product is still in development and they aren't ready for the big reveal.

Currently one can purchase the product online at the Tabasco Country Store for $4.99 for a 15 ounce bottle, about twice the price of the original sauce but they've done almost nothing to publicize the sauce.

Owner of Huy Fong Foods David Tran says that Sriracha and his factory are here to stay

When Grub Street asked Sriracha why they are keeping their new product on the down low, they replied,

'Tabasco Sriracha Sauce is a limited edition product, currently only available through the Tabasco Country Store. As McIlhenny Company develops new products and innovations, occasionally they are shared with fans through the Country Store.'

'Tabasco Sriracha Sauce is made with red peppers and has the slightly sweet and garlicky taste of a traditional Sriracha sauce with the signature Tabasco Sauce balance of vinegar,' they added,

While Tabasco's response doesn't answer the question of why they aren't making the new sauce readily available, rumor is that Tabasco isn't happy with the product or packaging yet.

Tabasco isn't the first to copy the chili sauce and it probably wont be the last. Time reports that Trader Joes sells a version of the sauce and Subway has Sriracha flavored products.David Tran patented the look of his product characterized by a clear bottle and a green top however, he couldn't trademark the name because it's derived from a city in Thailand.Tran first built his factory because Sriracha was in such high demand and now that the demand is high but he's had to limit his own productions, it's the perfect time for competators to swoop in and attract buyers.
