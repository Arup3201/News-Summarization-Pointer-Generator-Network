Plastic manhole covers are being trialled in a drastic move by a local authority after scrap metal thieves stripped an area of the traditional road coverings.

Councillors in North Somerset have ordered the trial after scores of the covers were stolen earlier this year.

The move comes as scrap metal theft reaches almost epidemic proportions across the UK.

Plastic replacement: The cheaper covers are being tested in North Somerset following a spate of thefts

Nineteen manhole and drain covers, which are made out of wrought iron and cost an average £4000, were stolen in just 48 hours across North Somerset in March.

The new plastic replacements cost only £400 and are built to last for 15 years where their metal counterparts require replacement after five years.

North Somerset Council is now working with motorcyclists in the Nailsea area to determine whether the plastic anti-skid cover are a safe alternative.

North Somerset Council spokesman, Nick Yates, said: 'We are trialling a new type of cover in one location in Nailsea. It is made of plastic and is anti-skid.

'We are now working with a local motorcycle group to monitor and get feedback from the group into the performance of the cover over the coming months.

Metal target: Manhole and drain covers are being stolen countrywide as the cost of scrap metal rises

'The new covers are also less likely to be stolen as they have no scrap value. We are trialling one of the plastic covers and if this proves successful, we would hope to use them in other areas across the district.'

Local residents have also complained that the covers at Church Lane in Backwell have yet to be replaced despite them being stolen  nine months ago.

The council has cordoned off the area around the missing covers to warn drivers and pedestrians, but residents say work needs to be done urgently to replace them.

Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment.

Rail
companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily 
basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number 
of thefts 'is huge'.

As
police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the 
country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing 
pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act.

The
coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them 
from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders 
down. 

Ministers are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy.

It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year.

One resident said: 'There is no street lighting to speak of along Church Lane and to have these open manholes surrounded by barriers in the middle of the road is a safety hazard. One of the cordons is just around a blind bend and when you come around the corner you are on top of it before you have noticed.

'I wouldn’t have thought it would have taken more than six to eight weeks to order replacements and get them fitted.

'I believe there are some concerns about the fitting of these manholes because of the utilities which may be under the road.

'But other companies seem to manage to carry out work without these problems, so why can’t North Somerset Council. I am concerned that nine months on, these covers have not been replaced.'

Mr Yates said the covers were being replaced but there had been delays because surveys needed to be carried out first.

The metal covers need to be drilled into the road surface and sometimes cables and pipes lie underneath.

The council is also appealing to anyone who sees anything suspicious to report it immediately to the police.
