Ten former National Hockey League players, including All-Star forward Gary Leeman, claimed in a class-action lawsuit that the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions.

The lawsuit seeks damages and court-approved, NHL-sponsored medical monitoring for the players' brain trauma and/or injuries, which they blame on their NHL careers.

It was filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of players who retired on or before February 14 of this year and have suffered such injuries.

Ten ex-NHL players, including All-Star forward Gary Leeman, right, have claimed in a class-action lawsuit that the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions, allegations which Bill Daly, the league's Deputy Commissioner, left, has denied

The lawsuit seeks damages and court-approved, NHL-sponsored medical monitoring for the players' brain trauma and/or injuries, which they blame on their NHL careers

The suit comes just three months after the National Football League agreed to pay $765 million to settle lawsuits from thousands of former players who developed dementia or other concussion-related health problems - and in an era when more attention is being paid to the damages of head injuries sustained in sports.

'The NHL's active and purposeful concealment of the severe risks of brain injuries exposed players to unnecessary dangers they could have avoided had the NHL provided them with truthful and accurate information and taken appropriate action to prevent needless harm,' the lawsuit says.

'We are aware of the class-action lawsuit filed today in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of a group of former NHL players,' said Bill Daly, the league's Deputy Commissioner, on Monday.

'While the subject matter is very serious, we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the league and the players' association have managed player safety over time, including with respect to head injuries and concussions,' the statement said.

Ex-player Rick Vaive, right, said on Monday that ex-players are now suffering from debilitating head injuries, while NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, left, claimed that his body have taken the issue very seriously for years

The player's class-action lawsuit claims that:

'We intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time.'

The suit argues that the league continues to contribute to injuries today, by refusing to ban fighting and body-checking, and by employing 'enforcers' whose main job is to fight or violently body-check opponents.

And the lawsuit accuses the league of promoting a 'culture of violence,' in which players are praised for their fighting and 'head-hunting' skills.

Leeman, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadians, Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues from 1983-1996, suffered multiple concussions and sub-concussive impacts during his career, according to the lawsuit.

Since his retirement, he's suffered from post-traumatic head syndrome, headaches, memory loss and dizziness, the lawsuit says.

In addition to Leeman, the other ex-players on the lawsuit are: Bradley Aitken (Pittsburgh Penguins, Edmonton Oilers); Darren Banks (Boston Bruins); Curt Bennett (Blues, New York Rangers and Atlanta Flames); Richard Dunn (Buffalo Sabres and Calgary Flames); Warren Holmes, (Los Angeles Kings); Robert Manno, (Canucks, Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings); Blair James Stewart (Red Wings, Washington Capitals and Quebec Nordiques); Morris Titanic, (Sabres); and Rick Vaive (Canucks, Maple Leafs, Sabres, and Chicago Blackhawks).

In a statement, Vaive said players 'were kept in the dark about the risks of concussions and many of the former NHL players are now suffering from debilitating head injuries from their time in the league.

'Hopefully this lawsuit will shine a light on the problem and the players will get the help they deserve.'

Earlier this year, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, 'We have, on our own, a long history, going back to 1997, of taking concussions very seriously. We spend a lot of time, money and effort working with the players' association on player safety.'
