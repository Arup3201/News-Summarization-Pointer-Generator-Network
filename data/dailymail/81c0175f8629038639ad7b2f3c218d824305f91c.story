One child has died and another four fell seriously ill after drinking dangerous raw milk sold in health stores as 'cosmetic milk' for bathing in.

Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food.

A three-year-old, from Mornington Peninsula - south-east of Melbourne, allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk, the Herald Sun reports.

The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. 

Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones said the company always advised people not to drink the product.

'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said.

Ms Jones said the company labelled their milk with non-consumption warnings in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes.

'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said.

'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.'

Meanwhile, four children from Melbourne, aged one to four, have been struck down with serious illnesses such as gastroenteritis after drinking different brands of raw milk.

The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and it's packaging looks similar to that of regular milk.

There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier.

They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms.

Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester says raw milk, which is marketed as bath milk, can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea if consumed.

'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said.

She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people.

'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said.

'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.'

Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused.

Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law.

'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday.

An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging.

The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner.   

Dr Rosemary Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' 

She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea.

'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week.

'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.'

Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them.

Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only.

'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products.

'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'
