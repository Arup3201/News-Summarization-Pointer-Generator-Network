Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Liverpool did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at Anfield.

Brendan Rodgers took time out ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup third round tie at Wimbledon, to watch Fleetwood Town entertain Swindon on Saturday.

The Reds boss was spotted in the stands for the League One clash which saw the hosts held to a 2-2 draw - thanks to a late strike from the Robins' Louis Thompson.

The match at Highbury Stadium, would have proved a welcome distraction for the 41-year-old who is having to come to terms with losing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard at the end of this season.

Earlier on Saturday, Gerrard confirmed he will ply his trade in the MLS after deciding to call time on his glittering 17-year Anfield career when his contract expires.

The loss of the iconic midfielder, has been questioned by some who believe Liverpool could have done more to entice the 34-year-old to finish his playing days at his boyhood club.

Rodgers though insists the Merseysiders did everthing they could to keep Gerrard.

'I think if you look at Steven's statement then that makes it clear. He certainly knew my feelings on me wanting him to be here,' Rodgers said.

'He has been a brilliant captain for me in my time here. I naturally wanted him to stay here. His role is slightly different now, he still sees himself wanting to go on and play for a couple of years. Naturally at this level it was going to taper over the next couple years.

'He wasn't ready to go into coaching or anything like that yet. He sees himself very much as a player. When he finishes as a player then we can look at coaching then as he is someone who would be brilliant to come back as part of the staff. But his concentration at the moment is on his football.

'He said it himself he left here on great terms, both with myself and the owners. Anything else that is said beyond that would be wide of the mark.

'I've been in conversation for quite a while with Steven and had an idea of his feelings towards moving forward. He had always been really respectful in terms of once he made final decision that he wanted me to know first.

'In fairness to him we had a chat a few days before the announcement was made. I have been fully aware of things all the way along. He is someone who deserves fully that respect.

'What the guy has done in the game he deserves that time to make the decision. The decision is purely at this time for him and family. He is an iconic figure at this club and always will be.

'In time there will be an opportunity for him to come back here. At this moment in time in his life it was a chance to experience something different in his life.'

Gerrard took part in Liverpool's training session at Melwood on Saturday and will hope to feature in Monday night's FA Cup tie at Kingsmeadow.
