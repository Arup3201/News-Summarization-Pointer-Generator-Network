A newborn boy blinded by a hunter's stray bullet that shot through his living room window has returned home.

Shayne Iverson from Clarksburg, Pennsylvania, spent more than two months at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and underwent numerous surgeries following the near-fatal incident.

But on Wednesday, his mother Stefanie's 31st birthday, doctors gave him the all-clear.

Recovery: Shayne Iverson, who was blinded by a hunter's stray bullet that shot through his living room window at six days old, has returned home in time for his first Christmas

His father, 42-year-old Jeremie Iverson, told the The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the infant is doing well.

He and his wife haven't been able to work since the accident happened on September 25.

They have also been fitting in hospital visits around caring for their other two children, nine-year-old son Caden and Gabi, aged two. 

Shayne was six days old when he was accidentally shot in the head by a deer hunter in late September.

Touch and go: Doctors removed a blood clot to prevent his brain from swelling and battled to save his vision

At the time his father was cuddling him on the couch at home. It was around 7pm. 

After he was helicoptered to hospital, doctors removed a blood clot to prevent his brain from swelling and battled to save his vision with no joy. 

They said Shayne likely survived the shooting because the bullet that hit his head exited through his eye socket rather than hitting his brain.

Although the two-month-old no longer requires around the clock care he will need to return to hospital for future surgeries.

His father, who works as a carpenter, said their home is filled with medical equipment, medications and 'boxes and boxes of medical supplies.'

The Iverson family have set up a GoFundMe page where they released a picture of baby Shayne with his big brother Caden, nine, and two-year-old sister Gabi when he was a day old

Indiana County District Attorney Pat Dougherty has said the hunter had an agricultural deer control permit. 

No charges have been filed, though investigators have continued to review whether game regulations or other laws were violated. 

The hunter was reportedly 300 yards from the home and using a 308 hunting rifle on private farm opposite the Iversons' home.

Almost $18,000 dollars has  been donated by well-wishers towards the baby's medical costs after his aunt set up a GoFundMe page.

In a heartfelt note to The Ellen DeGeneres Show announcing Shayne's return home this week, his great uncle, Jim Coughlin, thanked people for their generosity.

He concluded: 'Although Shayne is no longer able to see with his eyes, he has reminded us that real sight comes from the heart.'
