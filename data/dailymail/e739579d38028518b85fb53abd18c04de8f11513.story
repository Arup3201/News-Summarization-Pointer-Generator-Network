The Department of Justice has 40 FBI agents canvassing Ferguson, Missouri to learn whether a white police officer should be charged with a 'civil rights' crime for shooting an unarmed black teen, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.

Reporters in Missouri have tallied up stories from at least 12 witnesses who back the account of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, 18, last week.

Still, a civil rights verdict against Wilson could subject him to execution under federal law.

The DOJ is conducting interviews with an eye toward determining if a federal case will be made of the shooting, regardless of whether the state of Missouri charges Wilson with murder or manslaughter.

It's conceivable that he might not be charged for killing the teen, but still face a trial in federal court for violating his civil rights.

Monday night mayhem: Law enforcement officers on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Missouri fired tear gas after shots rang out during another night of unrest just hours after Obama called for calm but hinted he won't show up there

Obama was asked directly on Monday if he's considered going to Ferguson, but he never answered the question

Americans who act 'under color of law' – including police officers – to deprive a person of his constitutional rights 'by reason of his color, or race' can be convicted of violating the civil rights law.

'And if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section,' the law reads, offenders can be 'imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.'

Attorney General Eric Holder will pay a visit to the Missouri flashpoint zone on Wednesday.

'I intend to meet with FBI investigators, and prosecutors on the ground from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s Office officials about the ongoing investigation,' Holder 
said Monday in a statement.

'As
 I informed the president this afternoon, the full resources of the Department of 
Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation 
into the death of Michael Brown.'

'During
 the day today,' he added, 'more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of 
the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot.'

Brown's 
grandfather also demanded on Monday that Barack Obama visit him there 
personally, but Obama had dodged a question hours earlier about whether 
he'll make the trip.

And 
Democrats in Congress are reluctant to ask the president to go – 
sticking with political loyalties instead of putting him on the hot 
seat.

Les McSpadden spoke to Al Sharpton on MSNBC
 Monday night, saying that Obama owes him a visit to calm the waters 
after his grandson met his end on a Ferguson street after an alleged 
strong-arm robbery.

'America
 is built on people coming together at times like this, and now is the 
time for my president to step forward,' McSpadden told the community 
organizer-turned-TV-host. 'I want to say this to my President: I voted 
for you, so you ought to be able to meet with me.'

So far, though, Obama's allies in the Congressional Black Caucus are declining the opportunity to pressure him into going.

Battle lines: Obama says he wants to be careful about weighing in on the controversy, but many in Ferguson are making their opinions known

Obama
 himself ducked the question on Monday during a press conference at the 
White House after a reporter asked him, 'Have you considered going 
yourself?'

He dodged by suggesting he didn't want to get directly involved when a federal investigation into the shooting is underway.

'I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,' the president said.

Instead, he said his role would be 'to get at those root causes' of race-based civil unrest – a nod to his 'My Brother's Keeper' initiative, aimed at black men.

Obama is sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson in his stead. The nation's top law enforcement official – also, like Obama, an African-American – will arrive Wednesday.

MailOnline reached out to a dozen members of the black caucus, all African-American federal lawmakers. None would offer even a hint of suggestion that Obama should make the trip himself, and none would speak on the record.

Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said Monday on MSNBC that 'I don't think the president needs to come to Ferguson. 'It adds another distortion. We don't need that now.'

But that has been the only weigh-in from a black member of Congress, even as the St. Louis suburb's streets have become a virtual war zone amid racial tensions.

All the 
chaos, one congressional aide to a Black Caucus member told MailOnline, 
is leading congressmen and women to keep their powder dry.

Standing room: Reporters crowded into the White House briefing room on Monday to hear a haggard and detached Obama call for peace

'No
 one wants to be the one who demands Obama come down there, and then 
things get worse. Everybody loses that way, and this is a killer 
election year,' the staffer said on condition of anonymity.

Four
 press secretaries said plainly, but only on background, that their 
bosses would be steering clear of the controversy entirely.

Brown, 18, was shot six times as he allegedly charged a white police officer, drawing riots from the black community in Ferguson – and an aggressive police reaction complete with military vehicles and arms provided by the federal government.

A tired-looking Obama said Monday that the law enforcement's paramilitary show of force could indicate that the Pentagon has gone too far in outfitting police forces with surplus gear.

'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,' the president said at the White House. 'That would be contrary to our tradition.'

But he has no plans to visit what has become the latest Ground Zero in America's continuing racial divide.

Protesters, police there have said, have come from as far away as New York and California to engage in angry demonstrations and confront police. As many as 31 were arrested Monday night, according to in-charge Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.
