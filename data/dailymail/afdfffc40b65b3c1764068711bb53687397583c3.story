Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 meeting in Brisbane where he can expect 'full and frank dialogue' over his country's actions in Ukraine, Joe Hockey says.

The treasurer spoke to Russia's finance minister in Washington over the weekend and confirmed Mr Putin will be at the leaders' summit in November.

'That has certainly been the consensus of other members of the G20 that President Putin should attend,' Mr Hockey told ABC television on Sunday.

'I think there will be some full and frank dialogue with President Putin at that meeting.'

Australia has faced calls to ban Mr Putin from the Brisbane summit after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 by Russian-backed rebels over Ukraine in July.

But Mr Hockey said the Russian leader's attendance was a matter for G20 members, not just Australia.

'We don't have any unilateral decision-making power in relation to that, and he will be attending,' Mr Hockey said.
