First up is Binky Felstead, who shares her favourite Tabata Wake Up Call Workout - a four-minute intense workout she promises is super fun whilst burning lots of calories.

Meanwhile, Spencer pretends he’s not in pain whilst working up an energising sweat with a 20-minute High Intensity Interval Training routine, also known as HIIT. 

This routine is designed to work on the abs, arms and legs by alternating periods of short, intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods. Clearly he abs-solutely loves it.

Britain's poshest workout? Proudlock and Binky have created workout with personal trainers they think will keep you fit whilst having fun

Despite Lucy’s claims she’s biologically incapable of sweating, she proves otherwise with her Beach Body Workout that uses just bodyweight without any equipment. 

It focuses on getting all the right bits toned before you put on that bikini or beachwear - something the actress-turned-model knows all about.

And then there's hipster Proudlock, who introduces a special yoga and Pilates-inspired workout called the Chelsea Morning Power Stretch. It not only works on your core but also helps with your recovery from the more strenuous routines, he assures. 

The Chelsea clan are currently filming for the latest series, which - quite fittingly - sees Binky dating a personal trainer, Proudlock rocking crucifix earrings, Spencer living up to his lothario status and Lucy getting up in everyone's grill.
