Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini would consider a move to Napoli, according to the Chilean's agent.

Pellegrini is coming under increasing pressure with his side five points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, in the Premier League.

City also face a tough task to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals after losing 2-1 to Barcelona at home in the first leg.

And Pellegrini's agent has revealed that Napoli would be considered if they came calling, with current manager Rafa Benitez out of contract this summer.

Jesus Martinez told Radio Crc: 'Manuel has another year on his contract, and he intends to respect it. I don't know, however, what the leadership's intentions are.

'Pellegrini has Italian roots, he's also been on holiday in Naples. He's a lover of language and culture. He greatly appreciates Italy and Neapolitan culture.

'You never know in football. Could he replace Benitez? Pellegrini does not allow me to talk about him in relation to a position at a club which already has a coach under contract.

'We have to wait a few more months, then if [Napoli President Aurelio] De Laurentiis calls, we'll discuss it.'
