Furious: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) has promised to retaliate against Syria after Assad's regime shot down one of its fighter jets

Turkey today branded its former ally Syria 'a clear and imminent threat' as its Prime Minister vented his fury over the downing of one of its fighter jets.

In his most outspoken criticism of the Damascus regime, Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to retaliate against the 'heinous act' and promised a change of military attitude to any Syrian officer approaching the common border.

'The rules of engagement of the Turkish Armed Forces have changed given this new development,' Erdogan told parliament following the shooting down of F-4 Phantom jet Friday. The two pilots are still missing.

His comments comes as Nato today condemned the shooting of the plane, but stopped short of threatening a military response.

Any risk posed by Syria on the Turkish border will be 'considered a threat and treated as a military target,' he said in a jam-packed room of lawmakers who frequently interrupted the address with applause.

Erdogan said his government would retaliate 'with determination' and take what he called the 'necessary steps by determining the time, place and method by itself'.

The prime minister said Turkey's military jet violated the Syrian airspace for a short time 'by mistake' and repeated that it was unarmed, flying solo when it was shot down by Syria 'without a single warning.'

'We did not receive a single warning, note from Syria (regarding airspace violation)...They acted without warning. This is a hostile act,' Erdogan said.

Erdogan said that Turkish airspace had been violated 114 times by military aircraft from different countries, including Syria, since January 1, 2012.

'Hostile act': Erdogan said the F-4 Phantom like the one pictured violated Syrian airspace for a short time 'by mistake' and was shot down 'without a single warning'

'Syrian helicopters violated our 
airspace five times'. These were short-term violations to which Turkey 
issued the necessary warnings, Erdogan noted.

'This latest development shows that the Assad regime has become a clear and imminent threat to the security of Turkey, as well as for its own people,' he added.

Erdogan broke with former friend and ally Assad, whom he called 'a bloody dictator' after unrest that erupted mid-March last year met a bloody response from Damascus, sending more than 33,000 refugees into Turkey.

'Turkey will support Syrian people in every way until they get rid of the bloody dictator and his gang,' he said on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Syrian government forces and rebels were locked in heavy fighting outside Damascus today, activists said, in the worst violence in the suburbs of the capital since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began 16 months ago.

Video published by activists recorded heavy gunfire and explosions. A thick trail of blood on a sidewalk in the suburb of Qudsiya led into a building where one casualty had been taken. A naked man writhed in agony, his body pierced by shrapnel.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported heavy fighting near the Republican Guard headquarters in Qudsiya, and in the suburbs of al-Hama and Mashrou' Dumar, just 9 km (6 miles) outside Damascus.

Samir al-Shami, an activist in Damascus, said tanks and armoured vehicles were also out on the streets of the suburbs and some activists reported that one tank had been blown up.

The British-based Observatory, which has a network of activists across Syria, said security forces and armoured vehicles stormed the neighbourhood of Barzeh, an opposition toehold inside Damascus, and there were sounds of heavy gunfire.

Video shot by anti-government activists in the city of Homs showed detonations from heavy weapons and plumes of black smoke rising over the rooftops of smashed and abandoned buildings.

Aid workers were on their way back to Homs to try to evacuate trapped civilians and wounded, but negotiations are still under way to secure safe access, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in Geneva.

Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said after an emergency meeting in Brussels of ambassadors from NATO's 28 member states that Turkey had the support of all its partners.

'The security of the alliance is indivisible, we stand together with Turkey in the spirit of strong solidarity,' Rasmussen said. 'We consider this act to be unacceptable and condemn it in the strongest terms.'

Ankara requested the meeting of NATO's North Atlantic Council to discuss the incident, which it has described as an act of aggression.

The meeting was only the second time in NATO's 63-year history that members have convened under Article 4 of its charter, which provides for consultations when a member state feels its territorial integrity, political independence or security is under threat.

While supporting one of its members, the alliance has tried to tread carefully, wary of aggravating a conflict which Western governments are reluctant to join in militarily out of fear of a regional sectarian war.

'There is very little appetite from the alliance to undertake what we call a discretionary war,' said Clara Marina O'Donnell, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Â
