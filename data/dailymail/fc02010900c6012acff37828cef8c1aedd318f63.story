Police have stepped up patrols around Kathryn Blair's £1million home the barrister (pictured at her brother's wedding) was mugged at gunpoint

Police have stepped up patrols on the streets around the £1million home of Tony Blair’s daughter after she was mugged at gunpoint.

Kathryn, a 25-year-old barrister, was confronted by two gunmen who demanded cash and jewellery as she walked her dog with her boyfriend.

Taxpayers have spent millions on armed bodyguards for Mr Blair as he tours the world  giving speeches, pursuing his business interests and working as a peace envoy.

And the home he shares with Cherie, which is close to Hyde Park, is protected around the clock by police marksmen.

However unlike her father, Kathryn – who qualified as a  barrister last year – does not receive specialist protection.

Scotland Yard said officers would now remain in the area around her west London home ‘for as long as they are needed’.

The attempted robbery took place at about 8.30pm on Monday as Kathryn returned to the flat she shares with friends.

She and her boyfriend were approached by two men, one wearing a bandana and holding a gun and the second covering his face with a scarf.

They told the couple to hand over their valuables, but ran off when they saw some of Kathryn’s friends approaching.

The mugging took place just metres from her home, which is secured by a reinforced door with three locks.

Detectives believe the men were also responsible for a second mugging just half an hour earlier in a nearby street.

Both crimes are being investigated by the most senior detectives in Westminster’s robbery and burglary squad.

Detective Inspector Chris Rhodes said the crimes were being taken extremely seriously.

‘Fortunately none of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen,’ he said.

‘However, being confronted by an armed
man is deeply distressing. We are now appealing for the public’s help 
to try and track down the man responsible and his accomplice.

‘If you were out and about around this area on Monday night and saw something then please get in touch.’

He added: ‘Detectives are in the process of tracking down CCTV from the surrounding area and our investigation is ongoing.

‘Extra patrols will be taking place in and around the area over the coming days.’

A spokesman for Tony Blair said: ‘Kathryn was with a group of friends. No one was hurt and nothing was stolen.’

Worried residents in the upmarket area said the crimes have left them too scared to leave their homes after dark.

And some claimed that their local council had tried to stop them upgrading their security arrangements – to prevent their homes turning into ‘fortresses’.

Marion Rowland, 68, said: ‘It is frightening to know that happened. I am going to take more care in future.’

Another resident said: ‘How terrifying for that poor girl – she must have been so scared when she saw the gun.

‘Some people will do anything for money. I’m living in fear, it’s scary to know people are carrying guns around here.’

She added: ‘I tried to get a strong gate for my door, but the council didn’t want “fortress London” outside our house.’

Westminster borough commanders have now tasked officers with patrolling the streets around Kathryn’s home.

Armed response teams, which constantly roam central London, have also been warned about the potential threat.

One neighbour said: ‘I have seen police a few times today, but it’s been quite low key.’

Blair’s eldest son, Euan, who married Suzanne Ashman at the weekend, was mugged by a gang of youths in 2001 when he was 17.

The teenager was left ‘shaken’ after the thugs told him to empty his pockets and tried to snatch a portable CD player as he was walking home one night.
