Six dogs have suffered chemical burns in what officials fear are deliberate attacks on the streets of two Atlanta counties.

The stray animals have been admitted to an animal hospital after being found with severe burns on their backs, thought to have been caused by caustic chemicals.

Veterinarians have been able to determine that at least three of the dogs were burned deliberately by someone pouring the chemicals over them.

Evil: Six stray dogs have been found on the streets of Atlanta with severe chemical burns on their backs

Two dogs have been found in Clayton County and four in nearby Foulton County and admitted to Fayetteville Animal Hospital, just south of Atlanta, Georgia, in the past six months,

One dog, a five-year-old Rottweiler called Tiberius was found next to the interstate with bad burns on his back.

'Someone is burning these dogs very badly,' Penny Furr, who is fostering Tiberius, told WSB-TV 2 Atlanta.

'We don't know who it is, but it has to be a horrible person who would do that.'

Erin Meurer of the Fayetteville Animal Hospital has been treating the dogs, one of them a young bulldog-mix puppy.

Pure torture: The dogs, such as puppy Angel, appear to have had caustic chemicals poured over them before they have been left to die

In recovery: One of the dogs slowly healing after she was fortunate enough to have been found alive

Deliberate injuries: Staff atÂ Fayetteville Animal Hospital say all dogs have suffered similar burns

Meurer told the TV station that although intention to cause harm could not be determined on all the dogs, the burns are similar.

'They tend to have burns running from about the back of the neck all the way down to their rear.

'The only other possibility that you could have would be like an over-the-counter flea preventative.'

Three of the dogs have been pit bull mixes and the other three have been Rottweilers.

Meurer says concern is growing among some animal rescue groups that these breeds are being targeted.

The Atlanta television station reports that at least two rescue groups, Rotts 'n Pups in Douglasville and Second Chance Rescue NYC, are offering $1,000 each for information in the case.
