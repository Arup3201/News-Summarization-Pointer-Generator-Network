A cat who vanished almost two years ago in South Carolina will finally be reunited with his owner after being identified more than two thousand miles away in Southern California.

Kevin the orange tabby was found inside a U-Haul trailer earlier this month by a transport inspector performing routine checks near the Arizona-California border.

The driver said they had no idea how the feline had got inside the carriage. After being coaxed out of his hiding place, the dehydrated animal was taken to a local shelter.

Luckily Kevin was micro-chipped, allowing vets to track down his shocked owner, 44-year-old Cheryl Walls. The Anderson, South Carolina, resident adopted the pet as a companion after her fiancé died in June 2013.

Far away from home: Kevin the orange tabby was found inside a U-Haul trailer earlier this month by a transport inspector performing routine checks near the Arizona-California border

Globetrotter: He had traveled more than 2,000 miles from home in South Carolina after going missing in 2013

By a weird stroke of fate, he had the same name as her deceased partner.

But not long after getting Kevin, Walls' four-legged friend went missing and never returned.

The kitty was but a distant memory before  suddenly turning up on the other side of the country two weeks ago.

Recalling the moment she heard Kevin had been found, a shocked Walls told ABC News: 'How in the God's name did he get to California? That was my first [thought].'

Overdue reunion: Luckily Kevin was micro-chipped, allowing vets (seen above) to track down his shocked owner, 44-year-old Cheryl Walls - the feline went missing almost two years ago

Happy surprise: The Anderson, South Carolina, resident adopted the pet as a companion after her fiancé died in June 2013 - she joked that he has now seen more of the world than her after his cross-country exploits

She later joked  that the creature has seen more of the world than she has in her lifetime.

Generous donations have been pouring in to allow Kevin to fly home. 

He is set to jet off from Palm Springs this week.

John Welsh from Riverside County Animal Services said it appeared Kevin had been cared for during the time he had been away.

But who - and how Kevin got into the trailer - are mysteries yet to be solved. 

Walls said she was looking forward to the feline's return and she would be at the airport to greet him.
