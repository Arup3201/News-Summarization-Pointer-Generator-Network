Oxfam was reprimanded by a watchdog yesterday over a poster apparently attacking the Coalition’s austerity programme.

Against a backdrop of dark clouds and stormy seas, the poster claimed the Government was creating a ‘perfect storm’ with zero-hours contracts, high prices, benefit cuts, unemployment and childcare costs.

It was posted on Twitter under the heading: ‘Lifting the lid on austerity Britain reveals a perfect storm – and it’s forcing more and more people into poverty’.

The advert was reported by Conservative MP Conor Burns, pictured, who accused Oxfam of using for political ends money the public had donated in good faith to relieve poverty and famine overseas

After a six-month investigation into whether laws had been broken, the Charity Commission concluded that the advert ‘could be misconstrued as party political campaigning’. It called on Oxfam to avoid giving the public the impression of political bias.

The advert was reported by Conservative MP Conor Burns who accused Oxfam of using for political ends money the public had donated in good faith to relieve poverty and famine overseas.

Mr Burns said yesterday: ‘The fact that the Commission have published this conclusion after a very long period of deliberation shows how seriously they took what was very clearly a breach by Oxfam.

‘I hope Oxfam and other charities will reflect very carefully on it, and make sure donations made in good faith to good causes are not spent on overtly partisan campaigning.’ 

Under charity law, charities have to refrain from political campaigning and remain neutral.

In a three-page report published yesterday, the Charity Commission said: ‘We considered that the text of the tweet and the embedded picture, gave rise to speculation and varying perceptions about the tweet’s purpose, leading to complaints.

‘We consequently considered that the tweet could have affected the view of those who received it and could be misconstrued by some as party political campaigning.’

Mark Goldring, Oxfam’s chief executive, said: ‘We have reviewed our social media procedures to reduce the risk of tweets being misconstrued in future.’
