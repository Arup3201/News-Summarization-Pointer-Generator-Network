Tiya Chauhan died aged 22 months after choking on a cube of jelly during a play session at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London

Staff at a nursery where a toddler choked to death on a cube of jelly were found to be 'grossly negligent' by failing to provide appropriate care, a coroner has ruled.

Tiya Chauhan, aged 22 months, fell unconscious during a ‘free flow’ play session at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London.

On the morning of Tiya's death in August 2012, 
there were 11 members of staff working at the nursery, supervising 30 
children aged up to four years old, Westminster Coroner's Court heard.

The rooms of the nursery were opened up allowing children of different groups to play in a 'free flow' session that encourages them to engage in a range of indoor and outdoor activities. One of the games was a sensory table that included cubes of jelly.

But no one saw Tiya pick up the jelly or put it in her mouth, the court was told.

Prashant Popat, representing Tiya's parents, Dipa and Chetan Chauhan, said: 'No adult in that nursery saw Tiya take jelly from the table.

'No adult saw or heard Tiya put jelly in her mouth. No adult saw or heard Tiya choke.

'If she coughed or struggled for breath or made noises, she was not seen or heard. No adult saw or heard Tiya fall to the ground.

'If children must be supervised at all times do you really think that there was adequate supervision?'

The nursery staff argued there was adequate supervision and they had no way of knowing the jelly was a choking hazard.

Today the jury delivered a verdict of 'accidental death with neglect' and said that the nursery staff had been 'grossly negligent' in supervising her.

Her parents, who described their daughter as 'happy' and 'bubbly' wept as the verdict was read out.

Coroner Fiona Wilcox said: 'The jury concluded there was a gross failure
 on the part of the nursery to provide appropriate care for Tiya.

'There was inadequate communication between all staff which was a gross failure.

Tiya's father Dipa and mother Chetan Chauhan, pictured court after an earlier hearing, described their daughter as 'bubbly' and 'happy' and wept as the verdict was delivered

'There was a significant failure to carry out adequate risk assessments relating to the jelly cube.

'The jury has ruled her death was accidental contributed to by neglect.'

The inquest previously heard claims the nursery’s operations manager Derek Hayes ‘deliberately minimised’ the incident in his formal report to Ofsted.

He also admitted picking out a member of staff, Natasha Collins, at random and suspending her following the death.

Mr Hayes said he had done so ‘because she had cold sores’ but Miss Collins ‘thought it was something to do with Tiya’s death’.

Dr Wilcox told the jury: ‘He stated there was no logic to this suspension’.

But Mr Hayes ‘specifically denied there had been a management cover-up of this incident’, Dr Wilcox added.

The coroner recalled how the toddler’s parents were first told that ‘an unknown medical condition had not been ruled out as the cause of Tiya’s death’.

Earlier, the inquest was told that a London Ambulance crew removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from Tiya’s airway. She was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital but died later the same day.

The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by a foreign body.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Chauhan said: 'We feel very satisfied the jury reached the correct verdict.

'Nothing
 we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter Tiya nor relieve
 the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our 
family.

'All our hopes and dreams for Tiya have been taken from us.

'This hearing, although hard to bear has helped us and we are grateful to the coroner for conducting a thorough inquest.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Chauhan said: 'Nothing we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter Tiya nor relieve the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our family'

'This has provided us with an opportunity to better understand the circumstances in which Tiya died.'

But he said that unanswered questions remained following the inquest.

He
 added: 'The nursery has continued to deny any responsibility or 
accountability for Tiya's death in the face of overwhelming evidence and
 even to this day continue to blame the jelly.

'We are absolutely 
disgusted by the behaviour of the nursery, they mislead Ofsted by 
suspending a junior member of staff who had nothing to do with her 
death.

'We hope Ofsted and Health and Safety fully investigate the matter.

'The
 nursery has shown no compassion or remorse and the manner in which the 
Dicky Birds Nursery has conducted itself has been regrettable and has 
added considerably to our pain.

'Our aim has always been to establish
 the truth of how Tiya died so that other nurseries and governing bodies
 may learn by the mistakes made here.

'We believe the Inquest has gone some way to achieving that.'

'At the time we did not 
appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be. Immediately after the 
tragedy, we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries' - Rachel Berry, owner of Dicky Birds Nurseries

Mr Chauhan told the hearing they had previously had concerns about the 
nursery after their daughter had been twice bitten on the face, and they
 had wanted to remove her from there.

He added: 'She was loud, she was only 22 months, she was forming her personality.

'She would pull her brother off toys, push him away.

'She was bubbly, she was loved by everyone. She was an infectious child.

'If she ever saw someone she would go up to anybody, she wasn't afraid of anybody. She loved to get out.'

Dicky Birds Nurseries is a family-owned business with other nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton.

Rachel Berry, owner of Dicky Birds Nurseries,
 said in a statement today: 'We would 
like to express our deepest sympathies to Tiya’s family.

'For
 the last 18 years we have always strived to provide the best possible 
childcare by exceeding all of the national standards set by Ofsted and 
other agencies including the quality of our buildings, resources, staff 
ratios and training.

'During the 
hearing the medical expert gave evidence that even a small piece of 
jelly, in particular, if inhaled, could pose a silent and rapid 
asphyxiation hazard, from which it is almost impossible to recover.

'In
 2012, as was nationally accepted best practice, we were operating free 
flow play at set times in our nursery. One of these activities was a 
sensory play table dressed with prehistoric animals in a spaghetti and 
jelly swamp.

'At the time we did not 
appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be. Immediately after the 
tragedy, we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries.

'Currently,
 we know that food and jelly play remains prevalent in many nurseries 
and we welcome that the coroner will be making a report regarding the 
danger of raw jelly in childcare settings.

'We remain devastated that the tragedy of this day two years ago cannot be undone and our thoughts remain with Tiya’s family.'
