An underage teenage prostitute who slept with football star Frank Ribery
‘was not a vulnerable person’, the player’s lawyer claimed today.

Carlo-Alberto Bruso was speaking on the first day of a criminal trial 
which could see Ribery and his France international teammate Karim 
Benzema jailed.

Both are accused of having slept with Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian 
call girl, between 2008 and 2009, when she was between 16 and 17 years 
old.

Trial: Both footballers are accused of having slept with Zahia Dehar, a French-Algerian call girl, between 2008 and 2009, when she was between 16 and 17 years old

At the opening of the men’s trial at Paris Correctional Court, Mr Bruso 
said that Ribery had ‘no idea’ that Dehar was underage during their 
relationship.

‘There was nothing about her which suggested a vulnerable person,’ said 
Mr Bruso. ‘She is a woman who is always made-up, with her hair done and 
well dressed.’

Mr Bruso questioned the law on underage sex, saying that it was too ‘imprecise’  to prosecute the players. 

The age of consent in France is 15, and prostitution is legal, but only if both parties are over the age of 18.

In the dock: Ribery, 30, is accused of flying Dehar, pictured, from Paris to Munich 'as a birthday present to himself'

If found guilty, Ribery and 25-year-old Benzema, who plays for Real 
Madrid, face a maximum jail sentence of three years and fines equivalent
to around £40,000.

Benzema denies having any sexual relationship with Dehar whatsoever, despite her telling police the opposite in 2010.

She was interviewed by detectives investigating a vice ring at the Zaman
Cafe, on the Champs Elysee, which has since been shut down.

Top footballers, including many playing for David Beckham’s old club 
Paris St Germain, were said to have used the club to pick up 
prostitutes.

Nine men have so far been charged with offences related to the enquiry, including Ribery’s brother-in-law.

Neither Ribery, Benzema nor prosecution witness Dehar appeared at 
today’s hearing, which heard that Dehar had been a prostitute since the 
age of 15, but always told clients she was 18.

Court documents reveal that she attended Ribery’s 26th birthday party in
a hotel in 2009, and afterwards he paid her the equivalent of £600 for sex, despite being a devout Muslim who is married.

Benzema is suspected of having paid the equivalent of some £400 for sex with Dehar in a Paris hotel suite in May 2008.

Dehar’s lawyer, Daniel Vaconsin, said she would only turn up in court if
asked. She is now a celebrity in France, having appeared on numerous 
reality TV shows and started her own lingerie range.

The trial was today adjourned until January next year to enable the law on underage prostitution to be reviewed.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
