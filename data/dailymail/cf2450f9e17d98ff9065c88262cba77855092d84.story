Pippa Middleton bundled up against the London wind today in an icy blue bloke coat accessorised with smart glasses and her favourite Milli Millu handbag.

The brunette is back in London following news that her U.S. TV career has faltered at the first hurdle as NBC decided not to continue with negotiations following a 'cringeworthy' pilot.

But the 31-year-old seemed to have put her any career troubles behind her today as she laughed and joked with a friend in London.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister is rarely seen in her glasses, but pulled off the smart black frames with aplomb

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister is rarely seen in her glasses, but pulled off the smart black frames with aplomb, teaming them with a felt coat with a pair of smart ballet pumps, a printed dress and the £475 handbag for a day out in the capital.

Pippa will be an aunt again soon, as her sister Kate is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William next month.

And the former party planner was hoping to have more to celebrate this summer as she tried out for a high profile role on American TV. 

She had been in talks to join American TV station NBC as a 'special correspondent', but negotiations for the £400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a 'breezy' enough manner

The Vanity Fair Contributing Editor and Ocado magazine columnist, who was catapulted to fame following her sister's wedding to Prince William in 2011, has long been keen to make a name for herself in the U.S.

But a source close to NBC says Pippa’s screen trial, which can be watched online, was a flop.

In the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for no ascertainable reason. And came across as ‘a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic’, according to one insider. ‘Cringe-worthy’ said another

Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery.

'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.'

Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing.

'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued.

On Friday Pippa entertained the locals in south-west London in a pair of skinny jeans

She might live in the constant shadow of her sister Catherine, but we think Pippa Middleton holds her own pretty well considering her sibling is a Duchess!

She manages to pull out all the stops when it comes to red-carpet appearances, recently stepping out in Hugo Boss and she's got her off-duty style nailed too.

Taking a stroll in Chelsea, Pippa looked super chic in her jeans and blazer combination that she topped off with a cute leopard scarf, blue pumps and a Miu Miu bag.

We were quite taken with the suede flats. As much as Fashion Finder loves our vertiginous heels, we all need our trusty flats to get us from day to day and these ones by Jemima Vine tick all the boxes.

The suede material give the pumps a luxe feel but unfortunately they're not available in the US.

Not to be discouraged, we've found plenty of other blue suede picks below so you can browse before you buy.

'But it turns out I have two left feet, at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned.' NBC apparently agreed.

Ultimately NBC, it is said, was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with Chelsea Clinton. They were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous-by-association personality with no apparent aptitude for TV presenting, they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings. 

Friends of Pippa say she didn’t want to move to the U.S. anyway as it would be too far away from Nico Jackson, the 37-year-old investment banker she’s been dating since 2012, who now lives in Geneva.

And earlier this week she was spotted shopping a pretty leopard print scarf.
