A Californian teenager who grew up in poverty after his father abandoned his mother and two siblings has been offered nearly $3 million from nine elite universities who want him to join.

Lloyd Chen, 17, has received full scholarships to Harvard, Yale, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego and UC Davis.

After graduating last week with a 4.79 GPA, he has decided to go to Harvard which has just a 6 per cent acceptance rate.

Remarkable: Lloyd Chen, 17, has been offered almost $3million of scholarships from nine elite universities

It is a remarkable feat for a young man who has had to endure a difficult childhood.

Shortly after he arrived in 
California from South Korea, his father abandoned the family leaving his
mother Susie Yun to bring up Lloyd and his two older sisters Jenny and 
Sally alone.

With his mother unable to work because of an autoimmune deficiency, money was extremely tight.

But
Lloyd did not let his hardships hold him back, transferring to Mira Loma High School, 20 miles from his home, so he could enter its 
intensive baccalaureate program.

Sometimes after dropping Lloyd off at school, Ms Yun would wait in the parking lot all day to save petrol money.

Support: Lloyd Chen's mother, Susie Yun, and sisters Jenny and Sally watch his valedictorian speech

Proud: Lloyd Chen did not tell his high school counselor about his troubles at home until his senior year

Dedication: Lloyd Chen graduated with a 4.79 GPA from Laguna Creek High School

The dedicated student buckled down 
with his studies and, after moving to Laguna Creek after his freshman 
year, Lloyd was made the school's valedictorian of the class of 2013.

In his valedictorian speech, he told his classmates: 'It is your choice to have a fulfilling life.'

His high school counselor Alycia Sato said Lloyd always came across as a mature student.

She told NBC Los Angeles: 'I’ve never met anyone who’s had so many things going against them, who’s risen above them all.'

She added that Lloyd never revealed the difficulties he faced until his senior year when he began

discussing college applications because 'he didn't want anyone to pity him'.

'I never felt like I had hardships until 
senior year when I reflected on my whole life and tried to figure out my
life story,' Lloyd told KCRA.

In a touching display of humility, after learning of his nine scholarship offers, Lloyd sent Ms Sato a message which read: 'This is our success.'

In his college applications, Lloyd wrote: 'Throughout my life, I've learned to grow up without luxuries.'

'I don't need fancy clothes. I don't need expensive SAT classes. I don't even need a father.'

'I have something more valuable than luxuries: the foundation to grow and prosper. My circumstances have not brought me down, but instead, have made me stronger.'

Being offered the opportunity to go to Harvard is the perfect reward for the 17-year-old.

'It's been my dream since I was 8 years old,' he told the Sacramento Bee.

After Harvard, Lloyd plans to go on 
and earn a masters degree. And, thanks to a Gates Millennium 
Scholarship, he won’t have to pay for tuition, room and board, or book 
fees throughout graduate school.

He says he is considering studying economics, psychology or engineering.

Praise: Lloyd's school counselor Alycia Sato says he overcame many challenges

Struggle: Susie Yun was left to bring up her three children alone after Lloyd's father left them

Achievement: After growing up penniless, Lloyd Chen has been offered a full scholarship to attend prestigious Harvard University next year
