Forget million pound shuttle launches - all you need to go into space is a balloon, 24 GoPro cameras and an Oculus Rift headset.

At least that’s the plan behind an ambitious project, dubbed ‘Virtual Ride to Space’, being developed by engineers in the UK.

The group hopes to use the equipment to give anyone a virtual ride into outer space for £40 ($67)

24 GoPro Hero3 cameras will be attached to a balloon and sent 12.5 miles (20km) into the air. At this height the balloon will burst, a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to Earth while filming

‘Only 530 people have ever travelled to space. Well, lucky them... but what about the rest of us?', the group wrote on their Kickstarter page.

‘This project is about enabling us, the remaining 99.999992 per cent, to get that experience.'

The plan by the team at Surrey University sounds relatively simple: 24 GoPro Hero3 cameras will be attached to a balloon around 12.5 miles (20km) into the air. 

The cameras will be encased in Styrofoam alongside sensors, an SD card to store the video and a battery pack.

If all goes to plan, at this height the balloon will burst, a parachute will open and the cameras will drift back to Earth while filming.

During its third test flight in California earlier this year, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, pictured, reached a top speed of Mach 1.4. This is approximately 767 mph at sea level, and helped the craft reach an altitude of 71,000ft above the Mojave Air and Space Port in California

This will provide a 360-degree video that can be viewed with Oculus Rift as if the user were in a vessel heading back down to Earth.

The software will allow anyone to speed up, slow down and reverse time, and even comes with its own musical soundtrack.

Lead researcher Dr Aaron Knoll from the University of Surrey said: ‘For this project the experience is everything, so we're going with the cutting edge of available technology.’

The Oculus Rift, developed by Oculus VR, is a virtual reality headset, which delivers a high definition 3D virtual environment for the user.

Versions of the software will also be available for smartphones and PCs, for those who don’t have access to an Oculus Rift.  

Smartphone users will be able to look around by tilting their devices, while the experience on PCs will be controlled via mouse.

The project is now on Kickstarter where £40 ($67) will secure you a ‘ride’ to space. The group hope to raise £30,000 ($50,100) to get the project off the ground.

Have you ever wanted to see the world through your partner’s eyes?

That's the concept behind BeAnotherLab’s Gender Swap experiment that uses Oculus Rift headsets to let wearers experience how other people see the world.

Through the use of the headset, and a series of first-person cameras, the system creates the illusion that partner A can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner B, and vice versa.

One member of the couple is called the user, while the other is the performer.

Through the Oculus Rift goggles, the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer's eyes.

Each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner's mirror each others hand gestures, and so on, while wearing the headsets.

By mimicking movements, it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing, is actually being seen through the eyes of the user.
