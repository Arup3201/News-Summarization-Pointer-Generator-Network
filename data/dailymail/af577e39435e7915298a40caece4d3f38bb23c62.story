Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has come under fire for calling the people in the electorate of Logan, south of Brisbane, 'bogans'.

The comment was made during a sitting of parliament on Wednesday, with Mr Newman interrupting a speech from one of his colleagues to refer to the people from Logan by the offensive term.

The premier took to the floor again today to say that he had been taken out of context, insisting he did not think that 'the people of Queensland, in any electorate, are bogans.'

Mr Newman insisted that he made the comments in reference to how he thought the people of Logan were perceived by Clive Palmer and the Palmer United member for Gaven, Alex Douglas.

'Let me be clear, the interjection I made was in reference to Mr Palmer and the member for Gaven's comments on what he thinks about his constituents,' Mr Newman told the parliament.

He also insisted that his comment was not correctly reported.

In the original Hansard transcript, which has been shared on social media, it is reported that the Member for Clayfield Tim Nicholls said: 'He [Alex Douglas] may have been doorknocking in the Rolls in Logan, which is yet another unusual way of connecting with the electorate.'

Mr Newman is recorded as interrupting and saying: 'The bogans who live in Logan.'

To which Mr Nicholls replied: 'Yes, indeed. We know what the member for Gaven thinks of his own electorate.'

The Hansard record has since been amended so that Mr Newman's interjection only reads: 'The bogans.'

Mr Newman told the parliament today: 'On examining the footage, it is evident that what I said was different to what was recorded in Hansard.'

'I understand the mayor of Logan, Pam Parker, has taken offence to what was reported in Hansard and again, I would like to set the record straight.

'My government has worked hard for the people and city of Logan since coming to government.

'I look forward to continuing working with the mayor in the future and for the people of Logan.'

Logan mayor Pam Parker acknowledge the town's reputation as 'Logan Bogan' in a Brisbane Times interview in 2012, but said that she planned to put that moniker behind them and work toward improving outsiders' perceptions of Logan.
