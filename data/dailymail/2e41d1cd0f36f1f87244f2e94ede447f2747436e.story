Ancient graffiti belonging to a relative of Walt Disney has been discovered etched into the wall of Warwick Castle's prison.

Experts believe the 372-year-old piece of writing scrawled on the walls by Edward Disney proves how close Mickey Mouse may have come to never being created if Walt Disney's relative had been executed.

Edward Disney was captured by the Parliamentarian Army after the Battle of Edgehill during the English Civil War and held prisoner at Warwick Castle in 1642.

The distant relative of Walt would have awaited execution in the castle’s Guy Tower but because he was a wealthy noble he narrowly avoided being beheaded.

Historians at Warwick Castle found the evidence of Edward’s capture last month in a hidden room within the 900-year-old tower.

The faded lettering simply states 'Edward Disney 1643' and is etched into an arrow slit within the prison’s living quarters. 

Experts say proof of the narrow escape shows how hundreds of iconic cartoons such Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Peter Pan and Snow White were almost never brought to life.

If Edward had been executed like most other prisoners the succession of the Disney line would never have existed.

Instead, it is believed Edward was sold back to his family for a hefty ransom to raise money for Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians.

Aaron Manning, head of historical interpretation at the castle, which was built by William the Conqueror in 1068, said: 'The name of Edward Disney first appears in a room that was used to house prisoners during the Civil War.

'Guy’s Tower is where only the most important visitors and prisoners were housed.

'We had known of one name written into the wall with 1642 next to it but for a while we thought it was a joke.

'But when we opened up the second room last month, which we think is a bedroom, as there was a second name of Edward with 1643 and one other name next to it we realised it was an authentic bit of graffiti.

'We have been looking into it and have confirmed it really was Edward by checking records.

'We think he was here at the castle for a least six months to a year.

'The names of other people with Edward in the tower certainly make it a very plausible case.

'In fact, we came across a second piece of graffiti bearing Edward’s name when we invited staff into some of the locked rooms for the first time so that they could have a look round.

'All that we have been able to find out about him for sure is that he was called to muster for the Bishops War under King Charles I and that he is thought to have been one of the Norton Disneys.

'Just think, had Edward been executed then it is a possibility that Mickey Mouse might never have been born.

'It is tremendously exciting when you make a find like this.

'The rooms in which Disney’s name 
have been found are securely locked, and will not be opened to the 
public in the foreseeable future, allowing for us to carry out more 
detective work.”

Mr 
Manning said that among the recently unearthed etchings on the tower’s 
walls included a Hail Mary which dates back to the 1400s.

He added: 'It was done about the time of the Hundred Years War and Agincourt.

'We have no indication of who did it, but the engraving was painstakingly done and must have taken a very long time to finish.

In 1642, civil war broke out between King and parliament and Royalist forces laid siege to Warwick Castle.

But its defences had already been enhanced from January to May 1642 in preparation for the attack.

The garden walls were raised, barricades mount artillery were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two cannons were obtained - Royalist forces failed in their attempt to take Warwick.

The Battle of Edgehill in 1642 was a bloody clash close to Warwick, which was a stronghold of Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians.

Following the first pitched battle of the English Civil War – prisoners were held in Caesar's and Guy's Towers.

This was not the first time that royalist prisoners had been held at Warwick. King Edward IV was incarcerated in the castle by Richard Neville in the fifteenth century.

During the Second English Civil War prisoners were again held at the castle, including those from the Battle of Worcester in 1651.

'Our best guess is that it was a guest of the Earl or a member of his family.

'This
 part of the tower was reserved for important visitors, and whoever did 
it didn’t just inscribe the words of the prayer but carved out the stone
 around each letter.

'It is a beautiful piece of work.

'The 13th Earl of Warwick, Richard Beauchamp, went out to France to fight for Henry V, and it was he was responsible for the execution of Joan of Arc.

'He was in charge of the occupation in Rouen.

'He put Joan on trial, signed her death warrant and arranged for her to be burned at the stake.'

Historical records show Edward had been fighting for ill-fated King Charles I but was captured after defeat at Edgehill.

The battle was a bloody clash close to Warwick, which was a stronghold of Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians.

It is believed Edward survived the Civil War as a letter dated in the 1660s between him and a lord has been found previously.

The first Disney to arrive in England was Robert d’Isigny, from Normandy in France, who came to the country with William the Conqueror in 1066.

The family’s surname became Anglicised into Disney and they settled in a Lincolnshire village which was named Norton Disney after them.

Walt’s great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, born in Ireland in 1801, was a descendant of Robert d’Isigny and the movie legend spent much of his life trying to trace his family, a recurrent theme in his films.

When Walt came to Britain in the late 1940s, trying to piece together his family tree, he headed straight to Norton Disney.

Fading photographs taken in the village show Walt absorbed in the search for facts about his family name.

He is pictured studying the tombs and gravestones and with the vicar, leafing through reams of ancient church registers.
