West Ham are not worried about any potential FIFA ramifications in their ongoing feud with Senegal over the availability of Diafra Sakho.

The striker pulled out of competing in the African Cup of Nations earlier this month on medical advice after sustaining a back injury - but co-owner David Sullivan insists they have done nothing wrong despite the 25-year-old’s involvement with the Hammers.

But Senegal coach Alain Giresse bemoaned Sakho’s absence on Monday night after he featured, and score, for West Ham against Bristol City in the FA Cup at the weekend.

Diafra Sakho's West Ham United team-mate Cheikhou Kouyate showed his support on Wednesday.

On his Instagram, alongside a picture of Sakho, he said (translated): "Ok we stop talking when you do not know the truth about the history of the injury Diafra Sakho ! Please! because enough is enough ! It was his dream to go to the can with Senegal but God decide otherwise , I was present when he was hurt ! Diafra and I had to take the same plane to join the group but unfortunately he could not fly for six weeks ! But could play in three weeks ! The problem is that the injury he had does not support the aircraft for six weeks !!! Want more explanation , or you want to still keep talking ? iamdiafrasakho big brother is coming soon insha allah I do not need t say Hahahaha be strong because I know you boy bandit doooryiiiii la. One love."

Senegal lodged an official complaint with FIFA - demanding that the game’s governing body take action.

But Sullivan has emphatically hit back.

‘A top back surgeon said Sakho can’t fly and he still can’t fly, he went by car to Bristol and is going by train to Liverpool,’ Sullivan told Sportsmail. ‘How can we go against medical advice?

‘We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred whilst playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.’

Sakho scored the winner at Ashton Gate on Sunday and is set to be included in Sam Allardyce’s squad to play Liverpool on Saturday.

The tournament in Equatorial Guinea runs until February 8, and although Senegal have already crashed out, FIFA can stop Sakho appearing for the Hammers for the duration of the competition.

That means he could miss the Premier League games against Liverpool and Manchester United, while they could issue a fine or an even longer ban.

Senegalese fans also want the Hammers booted out of the FA Cup. They travel to West Brom in the fifth round next month.

Giresse said earlier this week: ‘I’m very surprised to learn that he played. When you cannot fly for six weeks and then suddenly you’re playing a football game. There must be miraculous medicine in England.

‘This sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they cannot catch planes to Africa but who can still play football (for their clubs). It is a debate that deserves more discussion.’

Sakho has come in for criticism on social media after pulling out of the tournament, with one fan writing: ‘Congratulations on your goal, I hope you never play for Senegal again, the Senegalese people feel betrayed.’

Sakho responded: ‘I took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks. Very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger.

‘Sadness because some of your words touched me deep in my person and my heart and this, without you knowing what has really happened.

‘And great anger, because after all my struggles day after day, season after season to finally wear the jersey of my homeland, and my family, the only nation that matters to me - you doubt my love and my patriotism.

‘My absence at CAN 2015 (the African Nations Cup), my first CAN, was not painless.

‘The dream of contributing to the victory of my country got away from me this year, but it is not dead!

‘Never doubt the lion sleeping in me, as I never doubt the passion that burns within you.’
