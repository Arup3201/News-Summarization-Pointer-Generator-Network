Students at an Orthodox Jewish school in Brooklyn have been banned from wearing the thick-framed retro glasses that are currently very fashionable with celebrities and local hipsters alike.

Parents at the Bobover Yeshiva B’Nei Zion school in Borough Park, which caters to members of the Bobov sect, recently received a letter written in Yiddish from the school telling them about the new policy.

‘We are asking that everyone buy simple glasses,’ reads the letter. ‘The yeshiva will not tolerate thick plastic eye glasses.'

School children at the Bobover Yeshiva B'Nei Zion school in Brooklyn are now banned from wearing thick-framed retro glasses so beloved by hipsters

Thick frames are currently very trendy 
amongst people attempting to look 'nerdy' or seem more 'intelligent' 
than they really are. Celebrities who have been photographed wearing 
these glasses include LeBron James and Justin Timberlake.

But that hasn't impressed officials at Bobover Yeshiva B’Nei Zion. They believe the glasses 'give the child a very course look’ and represent the 'new modernism.'

'What we have to commit ourselves to is we have to stand on top of this and not tolerate the new modernism,' the letter reads.

'The good deed that accompanied the Jews in Egypt was that they didn’t change their names and clothes, and this same strength is still accompanying us and maintaining us in exile - in all generations.'

Other celebrities who wear the fashionable glasses include rapper T.I. and comedian Andy Samberg

'It doesn’t matter what age - a student cannot come to yeshiva with these glasses.'

Parents are asked to exchange the 'immodest' frames and told that the expense should be viewed as an 'educational boost.'

Lumiere Eyewear, a local optical shop, said it has already exchanged 30 pairs in just two weeks, reports the New York Post.

While school officials are also reported to have visited another local eye-wear shop, MS Optical, to decide which glasses are acceptable and which are not.
