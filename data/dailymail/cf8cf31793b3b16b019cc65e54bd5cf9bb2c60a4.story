Police were called to break up a girl’s 14th birthday party when a gang of knife-wielding teens torched a balcony and started a fight after finding out about the celebration on Facebook.

Mother-of-four Sue Sutheran, 46, was forced to dial 999 after more than 40 people turned up uninvited at her home for her daughter Keeley Lee's party.

Police sent five police cars and officers armed with Tasers to bring the half term party in Southend, Essex, under control.

Party horror: The half time event was being held for Keeley Lee, 14, left. Her sister Paige, second left, was also at the party which spiralled out of control after Sue Sutheran's (right) purse was stolen. Kaylee Gane, 22, (in the green) was allegedly told she would be killed

The trouble started after Mrs Sutheran, 46, realised her purse had been stolen and refused to let anybody leave her three-bedroom flat until they had been searched.

Although 24 people had been invited to the party, more than 40 turned up.

Some of the party-goers started making trouble, grabbed knives from the kitchen as weapons and summoned a gang of people via Facebook to join in.

A group of thugs kicked in a neighbour's front door and started a fire on a balcony at the property.

Mrs Sutheran then claimed she was pushed down some stairs and said her other daughter Paige, 16, was punched in the ribs during a fight.

She said: 'I told them no one was leaving until everyone's been searched. That's when they started kicking off.

'My daughter was screaming because I ended up in the street surrounded by these people who had nicked my carving knives.'

One of the yobs allegedly threatened to kill Mrs Sutheran's son's fiancee Kaylee Gane, 22, and said he would 'post her body parts to her boyfriend'.

The mother added: 'My neighbour's door
was kicked clean off it's hinges, I've got bruises on my arms and my 
daughter Paige has got a swollen side and swollen hand.

'One of them even squared up to my 
future daughter-in-law's face and said he was going to post her body 
parts to her boyfriend.'

Jewellery and £60 cash was also stolen from the property which was meant as a wedding fund for Mrs Sutheran's son Shane, 23.

She added that some baby photos went missing from a purse and she has got the locks changed because a set of keys went missing.

Police said they had initially been called at about 9.30pm last Friday by a concerned neighbour who thought a party was getting out of hand.

But as they were en route, they were told things had calmed down and there was no need for their help.

They eventually dispatched five police cars and a Taser unit just after midnight when they received a flurry of calls.

Inspector Matt Bennett, of Southend police, said they were trying to get to the bottom of what happened.

He said: 'We did attend and as a result there are numerous inquiries to follow up that will be quite time consuming.

'But nevertheless we will get to the bottom of what happened and deal appropriately with our findings.'

They managed to disperse the group but will now be taking statements and viewing CCTV, before arrests are made.

Mrs Sutheran has now been warned she faces
being thrown out of her Housing Association property if there is a 
repeat of the violence in her flat on the Woodrange Estate.
