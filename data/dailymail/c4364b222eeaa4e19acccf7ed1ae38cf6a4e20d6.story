A 67-year-old piano tuner who has worked for Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett is fighting to keep a beach house owned by his late parents against organizers of a major Atlantic City development who are trying to tear down.

Charlie Birnbaum has refused a buyout from the state agency in charge of redeveloping the ailing resort city's shrinking casino industry.

The 93-year-old home sits down the street from the failed $2.4 billion Revel Hotel Casino, which will close for good this weekend.

The state agency hope to transform the casino and its surrounds into a  a two-and-a-half-block tourism district, but need to purchase the properties currently sitting on the land, including Birnbaum's.

Not without a fight: Charlie Birnbaum, 67, who turned his love for the piano into a job tuning pianos in Atlantic City's casinos, is fighting the state's attempt to take his home in the shadows of the failed Revel Casino Hotel through eminent domain

Failed: Charlie Birnbaum on the roof of the home where he was raised in Atlantic City, N.J., near the Revel Casino Hotel, which will close this weekend

The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority wants to take the home where Birnbaum parents lived, and where his mother was killed, even though the Revel casino is closing next week

The three-story brick house belonged to his holocaust survivor parents and represents a great deal of family sentimentality.

'This building gave (my father) dignity. It was his refuge,' Birnbaum said.

'As it was for my mom when my dad passed away. Because of this building, my dad didn't die in a nursing home.'

Not even the killing of his mother there during a 1998 robbery diminished Birnbaum's beautiful memories of what the house meant for his family.

It's those memories that keep him from accepting a buyout.

Even with the hulking glass structure down the street preparing to sit empty after Revel closes this weekend, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority says it still wants to redevelop the nearby land where Birnbaum's house sits.

Birnbaum's lawyer and an attorney representing other tenants affected by the redevelopment plans met Thursday with a judge who is deciding whether the CRDA has the right to force them out through eminent domain.

The judge heard arguments from both sides in May and scheduled another hearing for October 6.

Though Birnbaum does not live at the house, he still goes there almost daily.

He uses the first floor for his business tuning pianos played in the city's casinos, and to play the piano still in the living room, which is surrounded by pictures of his family.

'The building has been my refuge in a similar way,' he said.

'I've been able to continue making a living and doing what I do.' 

Clientele: Charlie Birnbaum taught himself how to tune pianos as a child and went on to work with numerous stars in Atlantic City, including Frank Sinatra (pictured here in 1954)

The building is one of a few inhabited properties that dot the landscape, surrounded by patches of grass and undeveloped lots with for-sale signs.

His parents, Holocaust survivors, bought the house in 1969 for $13,000 when Birnbaum was in college, and he still rents out its two apartments.

According to The New York Times, Birnbaum's parents were Polish Jews who escaped the Nazis by hiding out in forests and joining the partisans.

His mother, Dora, lost her first husband and a three-year-old daughter to Nazi slaughter, and his father, Abe, lost his wife.

The pair married and in July 1944 Dora gave birth to the couple's first son, Sam, who she delivered herself during the war.

The family moved to San Francisco to live with a relative in 1952 before relocating to Philadelphia.

When Birnbaum suffered a psychotic breakdown while studying music at Temple University, his father decided to move the family to Atlantic City, buying the home at 311 Oriental Avenue in 1969 for $13,000.

Robert McNamara, an attorney representing Birnbaum from the Virginia-based Institute of Justice, said the CRDA doesn't have any concrete plans to redevelop the area and is out to 'destroy Charlie's family home'.

'They're just moving forward no matter what to create more vacant land in Atlantic City,' McNamara said.

Determined: Charlie Birnbaum said his commitment to keeping his Atlantic City house was to honor his parents

Elaine Zamansky, a spokeswoman for the redevelopment agency, said she couldn't comment on Birnbaum's case, but that the agency is 'accumulating land that makes it attractive for developers to buy'.

The opening of Revel two years ago had inspired plans for the surrounding South Inlet area, including a $75 million entertainment complex proposed by a group that includes former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal.

The CRDA had planned to use its share of revenue from Revel — 1.25 percent of gambling winnings — to pay for a $50 million bond to buy and clear several blocks.

But Revel's struggles led the agency to use a more modest $8.5 million to remake the neighborhood.

Birnbaum, who lives 30 miles inland in Hammonton and has made a living by tuning pianos at the casinos for Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and others, said he was offered fair market value for his family's house, about $240,000.

He said he would leave if he was given a detailed reason on what the city wants to do with the land.

'I was hoping that my parents would see some turnaround and some progress, and now I'm hoping and praying that I'll be the one that sees the turnaround and progress in spite of Revel and in spite of Showboat and (Trump) Plaza, because we've gone through some tough times,' he said.

'And if it means going through more tough times, so be it.'
