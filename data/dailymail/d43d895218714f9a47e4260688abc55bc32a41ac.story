She admits she used to get through bags of Haribo sweets while filming Big Brother and has even pinched chocolate from her children.

So TV presenter Davina McCall was perfectly placed to get on the sugar-free diet bandwagon, with a cookbook detailing how she eventually weaned herself off the sweet stuff.

But her book, Davina’s 5 weeks to Sugar-Free, has left readers feeling bitter after several of its recipes were found to be just as sweet as regular treats.

Bittersweet reaction: Davina McCall, above, released a cookbook detailing how she weaned herself off sugar

Diet experts say several are packed full of sugar – but in the form of natural ingredients such as honey. 

Reviews on the Amazon website criticised the title as ‘hugely misleading’ with some buyers demanding their money back. 

Experts at the British Dietetic Association said some of the recipes would warrant a high or a moderate sugar label if they were sold in supermarkets.

In the book Miss McCall, 47, advises readers to replace table sugar with honey and maple syrup. She also suggests reducing these over five weeks. 

One disgruntled buyer wrote on Amazon: ‘Sorry Davina, this is hugely misleading. I am returning this book today.’ 

Gemma Sampson, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘Some of these recipes are not sugar-free or even low in sugar.

Miss McCall’s spokesman said: ‘As the title suggests, Five Weeks To Sugar Free offers a 5 week programme to eliminate refined and processed sugar from your diet. 

'The book does not claim to only offer sugar free recipes, as the programme is a weaning exercise and as such it includes some recipes that contain natural sugars.
