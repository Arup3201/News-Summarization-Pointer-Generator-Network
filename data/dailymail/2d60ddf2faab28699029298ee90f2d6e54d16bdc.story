A Scottish estate has been sold for the first time in nearly 500 years after being listed at £1.5million. 

Dollerie House in Crieff, Perthshire, has belonged to the Murray family since they took ownership of its grounds in the mid 16th century. 

It has been sold for the first time in 500 years to a private buyer after spending two years on the market. 

Among its unique features is a crooked bridge designed to ward off witches and evil spirits and a plaque dating back to the mid 1700s. 

Dollerie House in Crieff, Perthshire, has been sold for the first time in 500 years after spending two years on the market at £1.5million

The property is spread over an annexe with its own entrance, a south wing and separate cottage. It was owned by the same family since the mid 1600s until being bought in January

One of the eight bedrooms spread across the property's three wings. It is not known how much the house has sold for after being purchased by a private buyer

The main house is thought to have been built in 1780 to replace the original tower house which lay 100 yards north. It was demolished and used for storage thereafter. 

The newer building features a plaque, brought from the old house and dated 1741, which reads: 'In humane life thers nothing stedfast stands youth riches glorie fades deaths sure att hand'. 

The inscription is signed AM (Anthony Murray), with a Murray star.

Five years later a son of the family was killed at the historic  battle of Culloden

Its most unique feature is a crooked bridge over a burn designed to thwart witches from approaching the house. At the time it was said supernatural spirits would not be able to make the crossing if they could not see the other side. 

The bridge bears a date stone of 1778 and has a heavily fortified gate which divides two parishes. 

In the house is a three-bedroom annexe with its own entrance, kitchen and living room. In the south wing are another three bedrooms, with two more sleeping quarters in the separate Dollerie Cottage. 

The property comes with stables and is set in 90 acres of parkland. 

It was sold in January for the first time by estate agent Savills. 

The crooked bridge at the property reportedly designed to ward off witches who, legend said, would make not a crossing over water if they could not see to the other side
