The big dash to the beaches of Europe – and Britain – is underway as schools across the country begin to break up for the summer.

This week marks the end of the academic year in many parts of the country – and parents are already eyeing the clock as a summer exodus begins.

Holiday carrier Thomson Airways is expecting a busy few days, and is expecting to fly more than 70,000 passengers off on summer breaks this weekend.

Let's get out of here: British travellers will be heading for Europe's beaches this weekend

Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have revealed that they are due to take one million people away on trips this summer.

It seems that British travellers will be keeping to familiar destinations in the next few weeks.

The Spanish island of Mallorca, Dalaman in Turkey, and the beaches of the Riviera Maya in Mexico are among the most popular destinations this summer – while bookings to Jamaica and Mauritius have also been going well.

Over the coming weeks, Thomson Airways will make more than 6,200 round trips to summer holiday destinations, while Thomson's four cruise ships will take 50,000 passengers to 128 ports of call.

While passengers will be hoping to avoid summer chaos at the airport, there may be delays for those expecting to travel within the UK.

The West Coast Main Line – the key rail route between London and Scotland – will be the subject of closures, with sections of the track due to be fenced off for three separate periods in August while maintenance work is conducted at Watford in Hertfordshire.

The closures, which will have a significant impact on travellers, including those on London Midland services, will come into effect on 9-11 August, 16-18 August and 23-26 August. Those last three days stretch across the August bank holiday weekend.

Work will also be ongoing on at the London terminal London Bridge.

Between Saturday 23 August and Sunday 31 August, part of the station will be closed – and First Capital Connect and Southern services will not stop there, although Southeastern services will be able to call as normal.

This will also affect Southern services to and from Victoria station in London, including the Gatwick Express, and some other Southern routes.

Engineering work means that there will be no Heathrow Express services on Saturday 23 August.
