He's a rap star with something of a bad boy reputation.

So these photographs of Rihanna cosying up to A$AP Rocky in New York should perhaps come as no surprise.

The megastar - who has previously dated Chris Brown and Drake - was snapped getting close with the 24-year-old both on and off camera as they filmed a music video in Manhattan.

The shots - taken in the early hours of Thursday morning - have fuelled speculation that the 25-year-old singer and the Harlem-born rapper - who supported her on part of her Diamonds world tour - are more than just friends.

In one, A$AP Rocky - real name Rakim Mayers - can be seen smiling down at Rihanna and leaning towards the star.

In another, the rapper has a hand on her shoulder and the pair appear to be kissing.

Rihanna and A$AP have been linked in the past, but both parties denied any romantic involvement.

Earlier that night the 25-year-old 
singer had stepped out in New York wearing a striking zebra print dress 
which covered her from neck to toe.

With it’s high neckline and long sleeves the frock was a far cry from Rihanna’s signature risque look.

The star was spotted heading for a night out in New York and by the looks of her dress it was set to be a glam affair.

Rihanna was hard to miss in her stand out dress which featured a bold zebra print and a bizarre feathered collar.

The only hint of skin came as the Diamonds singer walked, with a flash of skin glimpsed through a split in the skirt.

The star finished her look with a slick of bright red lipstick, some simple black heels, and a selection of sparkly rings on her fingers.

With her hair back to her short crop, Rihanna made sure her dress did all the talking, leaving the flashy accessories behind.

Rihanna's best pal Melissa Ford was spotted leaving the hotel with the chart-topper, in a decidedly more dressed down look of baseball cap and black sweater, as she helped her pal get through the crowd of photographers and fans.

Reports had swirled suggesting the star was filming into the small hours with A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg.

The trio were all spotted entering the same recording studio earlier in the day, before the group reportedly hit the streets of SoHo to shoot a joint music video.

RiRi's night-time look followed another covered up ensemble during the day, which saw the Stay songstress turn herself into a walking advertisement for her Rihanna For River Island line.

The star headed to a dentist appointment in a camouflage crop top from her new collection for the high street store.

Teaming the tummy baring top with a pair of dark denim boyfriend jeans, metallic stilettos, and a gold Chanel hat, Rihanna made sure her new range was getting a ton of exposure.

With her second collection for the high street store officially launching on September 12, Rihanna has been doing her best to drum up interest.

The star stepped out in a few casual pieces again on Tuesday, proving the collection's versatility.

Following her fashion show debut earlier this year, the star stated: 'I've wanted to design my own fashion line for a very long time.

'This is something I've wanted to do ever since I started loving fashion.

'I got passionate about it and every time I saw something on a rack there would be something I'd want to do to it to change it.

'So I felt like the only way I could do that would be to design the perfect thing for me.

'This is my way of doing that - teaming up with River Island and designing clothes for young women with young, sassy personalities.'
