Criminal gangs from Romania are responsible for a boom in cash machine card thefts.

Over the past year the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants.

There were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year, up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012.

Other card payment machines, such as railway station ticket machines, are also being targeted.

The techniques involved are crude yet they can generate huge windfalls, with card fraud for 2013 expected to reach £400million.

Gang members using distraction techniques have been behind the rise in cashpoint thefts.

The thieves will often crowd round ATMs and read PIN numbers before stealing the card.

They are then able to drain the victim's account. Often the elderly and the most vulnerable are the targets.

As the number of these distraction thefts has soared, thieves have started deploying the scam in shops, railway stations and cafes.

Other thieves use more sophisticated ATM scams - and will fit the machine with a 'skimming' device which will make a copy of the card's details.

A wide array of scams that have been deployed at cashpoints across the country include:

Spring traps - Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it.

Cash traps - Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'.

Jammers - An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction.

Skimmers - Thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash.

Transaction reversal fraud - Involves 'tricking' ATM into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the ATM to pay more than the balance available. Can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them.

Gang members will crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four-digit PIN, then distract them to steal the card. In some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user.

Someone reads the PIN over the victim’s shoulder and then, when they have moved away, retrieves the card. Once the thieves have the card and PIN they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim’s account.

Pensioner Jacqueline Fletcher was 
watched by two thieves while she withdrew cash from an ATM outside her 
local supermarket in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire.

When
 the 80-year-old emerged from the shop, one of the men asked her for 
change and stole her bank card while pretending to help her with her 
purse.

‘It frightened me and
 it gutted me to think that I’d been stupid enough and that they’d been 
attacking vulnerable people, young or old,’ she said.

‘It’s obvious that they’d seen me as an easy mark.’

Last month a woman in Cheltenham had 
her cards stolen in a supermarket car park as she was distracted by a 
man asking for directions. She believes the criminals, who siphoned 
£1,000 from her account, spotted her using her PIN at a store till.

Meanwhile, victims are finding it 
increasingly difficult to get their stolen cash refunded. A number of 
banks have introduced rules which means they can deny a refund if they 
believe the customer has failed to protect their PIN and card.

The theft figures were revealed by 
Financial Fraud Action, which is responsible for tackling plastic card 
fraud on behalf of banks. Chip and PIN cards were introduced by the 
industry in 2005 with the aim of reducing fraud.

The chip means the cards are difficult to copy, while a PIN is considered more secure than a signature.

Card skimming: This cash machine has been fitted with a skimming device which covers the whole right hand side of the machine and is very yard to spot. It reads information from the card's magnetic strip enabling thieves to steal. Card skimming is one of the more sophisticated techniques used by thieves

Initially
 there was a dip in card fraud, however this is now rising again. The 
total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last 
year, by £47million to £388million, Fraud is expected to top £400million
 this year.

The City of London Police’s dedicated
 cheque and plastic crime unit calculates that 92 per cent of all cash 
machine fraud is committed by Romanian nationals.

In March, authorities in Europe 
arrested 44 members of a global card fraud network in a joint operation 
against a criminal gang targeting victims in Britain and 15 other 
countries. The operation, dubbed Pandora Storm, shut down illegal 
workshops producing card machine theft devices and involved 82 house 
searches in Romania and the UK.

In 2008 Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, was 
jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 
cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million.

Police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash.

Speaking last year, Commander Steve Head, of City of London Police, said: ‘We can see quite clearly what they are doing with the money back in Romania. They are spending it on a lavish lifestyle, flash cars, flash houses.

‘What sits behind it all is the greed – the greed of the people who are organising it, the greed of the professionals along the way who are enabling it.’

Another scam used by the gangs see them calling people at home pretending to be from the security department of their bank.

They warn their card details have been stolen and run through a series of security questions, including asking their target to volunteer their PIN. They then send an apparently official courier to collect the card.

Financial Fraud Action said people need to protect themselves and their cards. The organisation advises standing close to the cash machine and shielding the keypad when entering a PIN.

A spokesman said: ‘If someone is crowding or watching you, cancel the transaction and go to another machine.  Do not accept help from seemingly well-meaning strangers and never allow yourself to be distracted.

‘If your card is retained by the machine for any reason, report it to your card company immediately.’

Scam: Leonid Rotaru avoided jail last December despite being involved in a £3m cash machine fraud

A Romanian man involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims walked free from court.

Leonid Rotaru helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them.

The scam was relatively sophisticated - and can be contrasted with other cash machine thefts where the thieves surreptitiously read the user's pin before stealing their card.

Police investigating Rotaru said they discovered 9,000 different card accounts on a computer they seized.

Detectives estimated that the network to which Rotaru belonged had access to at least £3 million, based on the average fraud per card for typical skimming offences.

But despite that the fraudster, 32, avoided a jail term when he appeared before Taunton Crown Court last December.

He was instead given a 18-month prison sentence which was suspended for two years.

Speaking outside the court, Avon and Somerset Police civilian investigator Barrie Douglas said: 'The potential in these cases is always for a lot of money to be made. Banks say the average (fraud) per card is around £460.'

Rotaru's role in the scam was to fit the discreet skimming device to a cash machine, which was later removed and used to download the card details relevant to each unwitting victim’s account.

Those details were then sent on an email to another man.

Rotaru, of Bridgwater, Somerset, told police he was 'at the bottom end' of the operation, and that the 'big boys operated out of London'.

He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours community service.
