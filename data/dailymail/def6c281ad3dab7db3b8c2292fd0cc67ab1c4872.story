A freakish accident in Pittsburgh on Thursday resulted in a car flipping over and landing on top of a fountain.

The driver was pulled from the wreck after the incident and was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital. His name and condition have not been released.

Witnesses say the car was not going very fast, about 30 or 40mph, when the crash happened.

Unbelievable: The car flipped onto its roof, landing right on top of the fountain

Flipped: The car landed upside down in the fountain just inside the entrance of Highland Park in Pittsburgh

Surrounded by water: Helicopter footage shows how the car landed in the fountain which is in the middle of a pool of water

The driver, whose name and condition is not known, was pulled from his car after the incident and was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital

Pittsburgh police Sgt. Mike Pilyih said the driver drove straight through the entrance area of the fountain before it hit a bench and knocked it into the pond, then hit the front of the fountain after which the car flipped and landed right on top of the fountain.

A witness, Willie Phifer, said the car went about 7 feet into the air before landed upside down on the fountain.

Sarah Hagerty, another witness, said she and other bystanders ran over to help the driver.

‘We kind of held his head out of the water and kept his spine stabilized and waited until the paramedics and firemen got there,’ she told Wpxi.

Normal day: This is what the Highland Park fountain looks like without a car in the middle of it

Busy area: Witnesses say there are normally a lot of people walking around the fountain area, which is why it is a miracle no one was hit

Rescue operation: A team of paramedics and rescue workers pulled the man from the car wreck

Stretcher: The driver was put on a stretcher and carried out of the car by the rescue team

Helping hand: The team helped each other to carry the driver to dry land where they put him in an ambulance

Hagerty, who lives in the neighbourhood, said the area was ‘pretty well populated’ with a lot of people walking about.

‘For him to not hit anyone in that front section is pretty amazing.’

Tow trucks were brought in to remove the car from the fountain.
