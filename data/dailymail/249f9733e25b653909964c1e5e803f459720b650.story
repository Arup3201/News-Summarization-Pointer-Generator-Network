The CIA's barrage of drones and operatives to take on al Qaeda in Pakistan also had a more novel tactic - a secret shipment of custom-made Osama bin Laden dolls with faces which melted into a demonic mask.

The agency secretly began developing the 12-inch doll in 2005 which had a painted face, made in a heat-dissolving material, designed to flake off and reveal a red-faced bin Laden with glowing green eyes and black facial stripes.

The plan had one aim - to frighten children and their parents into staying away from bin Laden and his terrorist network.

The project's code name was 'Devil Eyes', a source told The Washington Post.

The CIA worked with renowned toymaker Donald Levine to make the bin Laden doll. Mr Levine was the mastermind behind the beloved G.I. Joe which made more than $5billion for company Hasbro.

Mr Levine, who served in the Army in Korea, said he got the idea for the moveable G.I. Joe figure as a way to honor veterans.

According to The Post, the CIA turned to Mr Levine because he had a sprawling network of contacts in Chinese manufacturing where the dolls were to be made. He had the ability to have the dolls made in a discreet way, The Post reported. Mr Levine died last month aged 86 after a battle with cancer.

Three prototypes of the doll were made by superimposing bin Laden's head on a standard 12-inch doll figure that was already being made in the city of Dongguan.

Using widely-circulated images of bin Laden, a Chinese artist painted a doll face to look like the 9/11 perpetrator.

The doll was dressed in traditional robes and housed in a cheap cardboard box.

Prototypes of an Osama bin Laden action figure doll, seen here are two sample heads. The final version had an unusual feature. The faces of the figures were painted with a heat-dissolving material, designed to peel off and reveal a red-faced bin Laden who looked like a demon

It is unclear how many bin Laden 
dolls were finally made but one source said a shipment of hundreds had 
made it into Karachi, Pakistan's capital.

The project was finally shelved - but at least one of the dolls is believed to remain at CIA headquarters in Washington D.C.

In a statement to MailOnline, CIA spokesperson K. J. Caldwell said: 'The action figure idea was proposed
and rejected by CIA before it got past the prototype stage.

'To our
knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created and
these were merely to show what a final product might look like.

'After
being presented with these examples, the CIA declined to pursue this idea and
did not produce or distribute any of these action figures.Â 
Furthermore, CIA has no knowledge of these action figures being produced
or distributed by others.'

Hasbro executive Don Levine, who created the beloved G.I. Joe action figure, was called upon by the CIA to use his expertise when it came to making the Osama bin Laden doll. Mr Levine passed away last month aged 86
