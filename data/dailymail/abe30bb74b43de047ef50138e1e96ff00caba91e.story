It's no spring chicken!

McDonald's is bringing back a menu item it got rid of just two years ago.

The company has announced it is bringing back its chicken tenders, called Chicken Selects. 

Remember these? If you’ve been pining for McDonald’s Chicken Selects since they disappeared from the menu, the chain has great news for you this March as they will make a return in some cities out west 

Flavorful: McDonald's started testing flavors that customers can shake onto their nuggets including Zesty Ranch, Chipotle BBQ and Garlic Parmesan

'Chicken Selects will make a national return in early March and [will] be sold as an order with three pieces,' confirmed McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey. 

'We look forward to bringing back this customer favorite made with chicken tenderloin.'

Chicken Selects were on the menu for a decade but were cut after the fast food chain trimmed its menu. 

McDonald's began testing seasoning flavors that customers can shake on nuggets this week.

So far, only locations in Northern Nevada locations are part of the tryout.

The flavors include zesty ranch, chipotle BBQ and garlic Parmesan.

The new Shakin' Flavor offering will also be available in the San Francisco, Sacramento, Chico, and Fresno markets.

Tryout: The flavors are currently being tested in some branches in Northern Nevada

To be sold only in three-piece orders at a recommended price of $2.99, Chicken Selects are 'a premium chicken product made from whole pieces of chicken tenderloin that are breaded and fried'.

Chicken Selects were introduced in 1998 and added to the permanent menu in October 2003. They were sold in three-, five- and 10-piece orders and included several choices of dipping sauces. 

The return of the Chicken Selects comes at a good time for the poultry business.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recently reported a glut in chicken production.

McDonald's has continued to sell other chicken items, such as Chicken Nuggets, which it has vigorously defended against 'rumors' that it contained undesirable ingredients.

As beef and pork prices rise, both McDonald's and Burger King have rolled out price war campaigns over their respective chicken offerings to move inventory. 

McDonald's is offering 50 McNuggets for $9.99 at select locations, while Burger King is offering 15 cent nuggets—or 10 nuggets for $1.49.

Rebound: The fast food giant has recently taken steps to make its menu shorter and simpler. This has been due to slowing sales in the United States
