Shocking waiting lists in the Welsh NHS mean patients are dying before they can be treated, it emerged last night.

Others become too ill for doctors to save their lives because of the length of time before tests or surgery.

Faced with the potentially fatal delays, many Welsh patients end up raiding their life savings to pay for private treatment.

Fears: Jeremy Hunt demanded that international watchdogs be allowed into Wales to carry out a comparative study of healthcare around the UK amid fears over the quality of care 

Nearly 1,400 patients annually wait at least a year for an operation, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show. In England, which is 17 times larger, only 574 people suffer the same delay.

Kirsty Williams, Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: 'These figures are nothing short of a national disgrace. It is completely unacceptable that nearly 1,400 people are being forced to wait over a year before being treated.

'Month after month we see the Welsh Government's 36 week target being missed. However these figures show the problem is even worse than once thought.

'My concern is that the Welsh Labour Government seems entirely clueless on how to turn things around. Waiting lists are piling up and there is little sign of the situation improving.

'This is why we need to establish a Commission to secure a historic and long-term plan for health and social care in Wales. A Commission with cross-party, professional and patient representatives would be able to work together and deal with the strategic problems facing our NHS in Wales. By involving doctors, nurses and patients from the outset, we would ensure that the experiences of those using our front-line health services feed into the efforts to reform our NHS.

'Whether it is inadequate cancer care, poor ambulance response times or dire A&E waiting times, the Welsh Labour Government is failing to provide the health service that patients in Wales deserve.'

The figures emerged on the third day of a Daily Mail series exposing the inadequacies of the Labour-run health service in Wales – and prompting interventions both sides of the border:

* In London, Jeremy Hunt demanded that international watchdogs be allowed into Wales to carry out a comparative study of healthcare around the UK;

* The Health Secretary also said English hospitals were coming under 'intolerable pressures' from cross-border patients;

* In Cardiff, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said patients had 'genuine concerns' that had to be taken seriously.

In just five years, 99 heart disease victims have died while awaiting treatment at hospitals in Cardiff and Swansea.

The lengthy delays were a 'plausible explanation' for their deaths, the Royal College of Surgeons said.

Other patients deteriorate in the months before their operations, making it more difficult to treat them when they go under the knife. The college warned last year that cardiac patients were regularly dying on the waiting list for surgery at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Today's investigation has uncovered shocking stories including that of a retired businessman who expects to be dead by Christmas because delays in seeing a heart specialist have left him too ill to be treated.

Robin Williams, 69, had to wait three months to be referred to a consultant and it was another six months before he was given an appointment for an angiogram.

By this time his condition was so serious that the specialist told him there was nothing more they could do.

Official statistics show Welsh residents must wait much longer than their counterparts in England for essential diagnostic tests. Some 36.5 per cent wait more than six weeks for an MRI scan. Across the border the figure is just 1.2 per cent.

A shocking 46.3 per cent of patients in Wales face waits of over six weeks for a colonoscopy examination, which is used to look for signs of bowel cancer. In England only 3.5 per cent do.

Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, who has campaigned on failings in the Welsh NHS, said: 'You can't start to receive treatment until you've had your diagnosis.

'What I have been saying all along is that it's morally wrong for patients in Wales to wait such a lengthy time – in some cases it is the difference between life and death.

'Too many people now are paying for private diagnosis when they can't afford it.'

The Nuffield Trust warned recently that Wales's lengthening waiting times should 'set alarm bells ringing'.

The trust published an authoritative report in April which noted that Welsh patients were waiting on average about 170 days for a hip or knee replacement, compared with about 70 days in England and Scotland.

A fifth of patients in Wales who had hospital treatment in August after being referred by their GP or another medical practitioner had waited over six months.

The target set by the Welsh government is for 95 per cent of people to be treated within this timeframe. The waiting list problem is exacerbated by the fact that 37,396 NHS procedures in Wales were cancelled last year for 'non-clinical reasons' such as hospital bed shortages.

Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies, who obtained the statistics, said: 'To find that so many families are facing delays to their treatment is extremely worrying, but to find that some patients have lost their lives as a result of pressure on waiting lists is simply unacceptable.'

Miss Wood told the Welsh Assembly yesterday: 'Aren't we now at a point where as well as patients becoming increasingly concerned, health workers are becoming demoralised too?'

A Welsh government spokesman said the number of postponed operations fell by a quarter last year.

Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford yesterday wrote to all NHS staff in which he condemned 'political and media attacks' on the service.

A Welsh government spokesman said: 'Since devolution in 1999, there has been a 92 per cent reduction in the number of patients waiting more than a year from initial referral by their GP to treatment.

A shocking 46.3 per cent of patients in Wales face waits of over six weeks for a colonoscopy examination, which is used to look for signs of bowel cancer. In England only 3.5 per cent do

'More people are being treated in the Welsh NHS today than at any time since its creation. Last year, nearly five million patients were seen in a hospital setting.

'The latest figures show the vast majority of patients – nearly nine out of ten – are seen within target time.

'The number of people waiting for routine treatment in Wales has increased over recent months, just as waiting lists have increased in other parts of the UK.

'Rising waiting times and numbers is a symptom of rising demand on all health services across the UK against a backdrop of significant cuts to public spending.'

An urgent independent inquiry into the Welsh NHS is being demanded by the British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and Miss Clywd.

Ruth Walker, Director of Nursing for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'Whilst we are unable to respond with specific comments about a patient under our care, we are very surprised to hear of Mr Williams' concerns. We will be contacting him directly to better understand what has prompted them.'

'The health board has spoken openly and honestly over the last twelve months about the challenges it has been facing, along with the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee, the commissioner of cardiac services in Wales, in meeting the growing demand for this important, expert care.

'Thanks to the hard work of staff and their commitment to tackle this issue we can confirm that by the end of the month no patient will be waiting longer than the 36 week target.

'There are also plans for investing in the service to further expand the number of procedures provided each year.

'We would once again extend our sincere apologies to anyone who has been affected by the problems last year and would ask anyone who has any concerns over their health or care to contact their GP for a review or to contact the health board directly.

'We would also like to reassure the public that Cardiff and Vale has some of the best outcomes for cardiac patients in the UK and our efforts to improve the service have been independently endorsed by the Royal College of Surgeons. We will continue to work with all our partners to build on these improvements.'
