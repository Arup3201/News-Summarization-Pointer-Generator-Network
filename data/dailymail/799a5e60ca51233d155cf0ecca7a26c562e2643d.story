Landing in the UK by private jet is normally the preserve of the rich and famous.

But then six-week old Dax is used to making unusual entrances, having arrived prematurely while his parents were on a short break in New York.

Mum Katie Amos and dad Lee Johnston were overjoyed at his birth just after Christmas - but faced a £85,000 hospital bill while they waited until early March for their son to be well enough to travel.

Special delivery: Katie Amos, 30, at home with baby Dax who was born 11-weeks early, whilst his parents where on holiday in New York

Their travel insurance company has now confirmed all costs will be covered, however, and flown them home in a specially equipped medical jet, complete with a doctor and nurse.

'When we were finally given the all-clear to come home I broke down in tears. We were so happy, no words could describe it,' said Miss Amos, 30.

'It was such an incredible feeling to step off the Tarmac in the UK. It was such as relief.'

The couple had been told Dax, who weighed 3lb at birth, wasn't be able to travel home until his original due date of March 10 as he wouldn't be able to fly on a commercial plane.

But Lenox Hill Hospital in New York gave the go-ahead on Thursday after insurers Allianz said they were providing the private jet, which has an incubator.

They left on Friday and stopped briefly in Canada and Iceland before arriving East Midlands Airport the following day.

Miss Amos and her fiancé, also 30, flew to the U.S on Boxing Day for a last holiday together as a couple.

But she unexpectedly went into labour on the second day of the four-day break while on a movie tour in Central Park.

'I was in complete denial when I went into labour. I just kept saying to the nurses I wasn't having my baby I was going home,' she said.

'It wasn't until I was being told to push that it finally started to sink in.'

What should have been a joyous occasions was tarnished by the sickening realisation they might face a six-figure bill for the medical care they received if their insurers, Allianz, didn't cover the cost.

'When we arrived at the hospital one of the nurses asked Lee to sort out our medical insurance,' added Miss Amos, a fitness instructor.

'When he came back he was grey in the face. The woman he had spoken to said she wouldn't accept our insurance. It was so scary.

'There was a huge list – even the examination cost $500.'

After a nail-biting five-day wait the couple, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, were given the good news that they would not have to foot the bill.

But they still had to wait for doctors to approve the journey – and apply for a U.S passport.

'To get a UK passport it would have taken up to three months and we wanted to get him home as soon as we could so Dax has a U.S passport and birth certificate,' said Miss Amos.

'Just to get the photo we had to remove all of his vital tubes that helped him feed and breathe – it was really scary.

'Being born so prematurely Dax has had a few health problems but he's doing really well now.'

She added: 'He has reflux which is common for premature babies as his little body has had so much to contend with.

'He's still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus which means one of the main arteries from his heart isn't closed properly. It's looking positive though as doctors say this should close on its own.'

It had been feared the baby wouldn't be given the all-clear to fly until March 10 - his original due date

She added: 'We have cried, laughed and felt everything in between. It's been a really tough journey and we are over the moon that it's finally over.'

The couple were helped while abroad by donations of nearly £12,000 that flooded into a fundraising website and was used for clothes, food and other essentials.

Mr Johnston, who is also a fitness instructor, said all donations were now going towards a charity that provided them with cheap accommodation during their stay in the Big Apple.

He added: 'Being the man of the house it's my job to look after my family and take control but I was completely helpless over there. I just tried to do as much as I could for Katie and Dax.

'Luckily, we were very prepared and my dad is a painter and decorator so Dax's nursery was virtually finished before we went. We can't wait to get him home now.'
