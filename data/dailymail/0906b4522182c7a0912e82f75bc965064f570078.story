Huntress: Charisa Argys and the 175-pound male mountain lion she shot out of a tree while hunting in Colorado in February 2013

A Colorado mother is being cyber-bullied by animals rights activists after she posted a picture online of her posing with a mountain lion she had killed.

Beuna Vista resident, Charisa Argys uploaded the picture of her with the 175-pound male big cat in February - but one year later the photograph came back to bite her.

Respected German journalist and animals rights activist, Silvia Wadhwa commented on a mundane picture of Argys's daughter and housecat recently by linking to the picture of the mountain lion - sending the photograph viral and sparking the vitriol.

'I posted a photo of my daughter with her recently adopted housecat on our local Humane Society Facebook page,' said Argys.

'The
 next thing I knew, this Silvia person commented on and posted a link to
 my personal page with a photo of my mountain lion. I have no idea how 
she found me.'

Argys 
said that the comment in question referred to her mountain lion 
photograph she uploaded last year and said, 'Sadly, you don't love ALL 
cats, Madame.'

The 
photo was then reposted to animal rights groups and anti-hunting forums 
such as the International Animal Rescue Foundation World Action - where 
Argys received a barrage of criticism.

'I have never been called so many horrible, hateful names in my life.' said Argys.

'They even went as far as to post my full name, address and directions to my house.'

After this, Argys managed to get 
World Action to remove the photograph and directions to her house, 
however on forums across the Internet, the abuse remained.

'They
 were calling me horrible names. They were saying they wanted to kill 
me, they wanted to see me dead, they called me fat, they called me ugly,
 they called me the B-word, they called me the C-word,' said Argys to CBS.

'There really wasn’t anything they weren’t willing to call me and to say.

One comment reads, 'The only answer is to take out these psychopaths. Problem solved — animals saved.'

Another comment calls for 'an eye for an eye.'

And
 another, 'You are a disgrace to those of us who respect life, human and
 animal. I’d love to hunt YOU and hang YOUR head on my living room wall.

'You
 know it was definitely cyberbullying. These were not just threats but I
 would say they were terroristic threats,' said Argys.

Indeed,
 while World Action did remove the photograph, they did replace it with 
an article about women hunters on their sister website,

Threats: Charisa Argys spoke to CBS in Denver about the abuse she has been getting online for her February hunt

Viral: The campaign against Argys began when German financial journalist Silvia Wadhwa posted the picture to an animal rights forum

The article is specifically about women hunters and labels them as having 'antisocial personality disorder or sociopathology.'

Argys said that she was appalled at the level of abuse she was receiving.

Argys has been hunting since she was three and said that the hunt for the mountain lion that day was her best.

'I am very proud of what I had accomplished that day,' said Argys.

Despite doing nothing illegal that day, Argys has been unfairly targeted according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Mike Porras.

'You may not like hunting, we understand that. But there’s a right way and a wrong way to express your opinions,' said Porras to CBS.

Argys said that she contacted Wadhwa to let her know the stress she had caused her.

In reply, Wadhwa wrote that she cannot condone trophy killing, 'But I do not and will not ever condone or encourage insults, threats or death wishes.'

Argys added she will not be intimidated by the online threats.

'If I don’t stand up for myself and I don’t take a position on what I feel passionate about how can I expect my children to stand up if it happens to them?'

She also plans to keep hunting.

'It was an extreme hunt and it was well worth it,' said Argys.
