Murat Can Ertani, 22, said he has no regrets over running away with British schoolgirl Faye Jones

The Turkish waiter who ran away with British schoolgirl Faye Jones has boasted that he already has a new British girlfriend and said he has no regrets over the 16-year-old's disappearance.

Murat Can Ertani, 22, and Faye were found on Monday after four days on the run from the Turkish resort of Marmaris, where the teenager was holidaying with her mother Rhonda.

Ertani, who has been to prison six times, said English girls were 'easy' and claimed he would run away with Faye or another English girl, as long as they were over 18 - the Turkish age of consent.

He told the Daily Mirror that he had already moved on from Faye with another British girl who had seen him in the news.

'I am in love with the girl next to me,' he said. 'When she leaves there is always another one. Girls love a bad boy and that is me. Girls get boring and I cannot stay with just one for more than a few weeks.'

Ertani was arrested when the pair were found trying to hitchhike in Mugla, 35 miles from Marmaris, but released the next day after Faye refused to press charges against him.

She told Turkish police officers: 'He shouldn't go to jail. He did nothing wrong. It was my fault for running away.'

The convicted burglar, who had been chatting to Faye for a year through Facebook before they met, called their disappearance 'an adventure' in his 'boring' life and ungallantly said the 16-year-old was 'not so pretty really'.

He claimed that she told him she was 19 but found out she was underage by reading a newspaper.

He denied they had had sex, saying the situation was too stressful.

Ertani told the newspaper that Faye was angry at her mother for making her go back home to Cramlington, Northumberland, instead of staying on in Marmaris with her grandmother as planned.

Rhonda had seen Ertani slapping Faye's friend Georgina White, 15, during a night out.

He claimed she had called him a 'dirty Turk' while Georgina said he had tried to strangle Faye and called her a 'slag' for dancing with other boys.

'I told her to ring her mum. Let her know she is ok,' he told the Mirror. 'She didn't want to. She wasn't bothered her mum was upset. [...] She was strong. She was very calm. She wasn't crying or anything. I was more worried than she was.

Ertani was released on Tuesday after 16-year-old Faye Jones refused to press kidnap charges against him

Faye Jones was reunited with her mother Rhonda on Monday after four days missing

'She told me she had Â£400 and her iPhone in a safe at her nan's house. She told me because I used to rob houses, which room the safe was in but there were too many police around.'

Ertani said he enjoyed his time behind bars and had served one term for stabbing a man who 'looked at me funny'.

He said he was a 'regular customer' at Mugla prison and had fun there, though he missed girls and drinking.

Ertani, who has the name 'Hannah' tattooed on his arm from a drunken night out, even posed for a photograph holding up a newspaper story about Faye's disappearance.

While the pair were missing it emerged that Miss Jones was not the first British schoolgirl Ertani has allegedly seduced.

Faye Jones was reunited with her mother on Monday in Mugla but told police that she ran away of her own free will

Alanah Longshaw claims he groomed her via Facebook, told her 
he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him 
in Turkey three years ago.

Miss Longshaw was 16 when she decided to give up her life in Scotland to go and live 
with him and his family in the village of Adana just outside Marmaris in
January 2011.

But after she 
fell pregnant with his child - Aydin, now 18 months - Ertani told 
her 'I hope you and the baby die in labour'.

But in his interview he said he would like to see Aydin and promised he would not harm his son.

Speaking
from her home in Scotland, Miss Longshaw said: 'We lived in an empty apartment
block with no electricity. Can would lock me in at night and often come
back drunk in the early hours of the morning.

Ertani told a newspaper that Faye was angry at her mother for making her return home to Britain instead of staying on in Marmaris with her grandmother

Ertani has served six prison sentences - including one for stabbing a man who looked at him 'funny'

'If I dared to ask where he'd been he would often lose his temper and slap and punch me.

'I stayed because I believed I was in love with him - even in those dire conditions. I finally wised up and came home.

'I haven't seen him since and he's never seen his son and I doubt he ever will.

'The
last message I had from him was to say he'd washed his hands of our 
baby and wanted nothing to do with him as he had a s*** for a mother,' 
she added.
