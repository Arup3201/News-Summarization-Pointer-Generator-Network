A cataclysmic meteor impact in Canada that is linked to the death of many animals, including the woolly mammoth, may have also been the catalyst that triggered the start of civilisation as we know it, claims new research.

Evidence suggests a meteor struck Quebec around 12,900 years ago and scientists believe this impact caused the Earth's climate to become colder and drier - known as the Younger Dryas period.

These freezes and droughts led to some larger animals dying out which in turn forced humans to change their diet and develop agricultural methods to cultivate cereal, for example.

Evidence suggests a meteor struck Quebec around 12,900 years ago and scientists now think this impact caused the Earth's climate to become colder and drier - known as the Younger Dryas period. Previous theories thought the change was caused by an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the Atlantic

The Younger Dryas period is also known as the Big Freeze.

It was a period of cold climatic conditions
 and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 
years ago.

Scientists from New Hampshire believe this change in climate was caused by an meteor impact, but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the North American ice sheets.

During the period, forests in Scandinavia were replaced with a glacial tundra.

There was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in Asia.

The drier conditions caused drought in the Levant, known as the region of Syria or the Eastern Mediterranean, which led inhabitants to agriculture.

The change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation.

Fragments of rock from the meteor are also thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun, causing temperatures to plummet, plants to die and landscapes to alter forever.

In North America particularly, big animals including mastodons, camels, giant ground sloths and sabre-toothed cats all died out.

The meteor strike is also thought to have caused the demise of the Woolly mammoth.

Human hunters turned to a subsistence diet of roots, berries and smaller game to survive.

Meanwhile thousands of miles away in the eastern Mediterranean, the first farmers started growing cereals.

The scientists claim that this invention of agriculture was a pivotal step in the development of large settled communities and civilisation.

Experts agree on the climate change that marked the start of the Younger Dryas period, but are divided about its cause.

The new research is said to provide 'conclusive' evidence that the trigger was a meteor impact.

Before now, the most popular explanation has been an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the Atlantic.

This in turn was thought to have shut down ocean currents moving warm tropical water, resulting in colder conditions.

Scientists analysed spherules, droplets of solidified molten rock, deposited in Pennsylvania and New Jersey at the start of the Younger Dryas period.

They identified geochemical 'fingerprints' exactly matching the profiles of rock found in southern Quebec.

Although no 'smoking gun' crater had been found, this was a strong clue that the spherules had been created by the massive temperatures and pressures of a meteor impact in Canada.

The findings appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Professor Mukul Sharma, one of the study authors from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, US, said: 'The Younger Dryas cooling impacted human history in a profound manner.

'Environmental stresses may also have caused Natufians in the Near East to settle down for the first time and pursue agriculture.'

During the Younger Dryas period, also known as the Big Freeze, around 12,800 years ago a change in climate caused many large animals to die out. This forced humans to develop agricultural methods (modern farming pictured) to gather food and is thought to have led to a rise in communities and civilisation
