A cafe claims to be cooking the biggest breakfasts in Britain by serving customers seven-pound fry-ups consisting of four times the daily calorie intake.

Mark Winder's 'The Hibernator' weigh in at seven pounds each and diners have to sign a legal disclaimer before attempting to eat one as it adds up to 8,000 calories - four times the recommended daily intake.

The meal, named 'The Hibernator', consists of eight rashers of bacon, eight sausages, four hash browns, four fried eggs, a four egg cheese omelette, four waffles, four pieces of toast, four pieces of fried bread, four black pudding, two ladles of beans, two ladles of tomatoes, mushrooms, a portion of large chips, and a two pint milkshake to wash it all down.

The Man Vs Food inspired challenge, sold for £19.95, has only been attempted by 20 people since it was first added to the menu - and no one has since completed it.

At around 14 times more calorific than a regular fry-up, the big breakfast takes around 30 minutes to cook and a disclaimer must be signed before challengers can dig in.

Mr Winder, 39, who runs the Bear Grills cafe in Congleton, Cheshire said: 'I reckon with these ingredients you could feed a family for a week.

'The breakfast alone is around 6,000 calories and the 2,000 calorie milkshake just tops it off. We weighed all the cooked food and it came to a whopping seven pounds.

'That's the weight of a baby. It's called The Hibernator because if anyone completes it they'll have to sleep for a year.

'We have a disclaimer which says that no one under the age of 18 can take part and that they know about the very high calorific content and high fat content. We ask people to understand that they know what they are getting themselves into. They have to tick a box to say whether they have any underlying health conditions.'

The breakfast is brought out on a 4ft turkey platter because Mr Winder couldn't find any plates big enough.

Challengers have an hour to eat the entire breakfast, including the milkshake.

Those who do eat the whole breakfast win £100, get their name on the Wall of Fame, have the breakfast named after them and also get to add another ingredient to the challenge.

He added: 'We used to set the time limit as half-an-hour but we realised that no one was ever going to finish it. Although we did have one guy called James who nearly did it in half-an-hour but couldn't make it to the end.'

The Hibernator was named in honour of the Congleton Bear, a historical tale of the town's attempts to buy a new fiercer bear for bear baiting in the 1620s.

Mr Winder said: 'I came up with the breakfast to get youngsters to come in and get involved. 

'Most of my customers are in the 60s and 70s and the reason I came up with the Hibernator was to inject some youth into the place and I think it has.

'Younger guys come in, and it is all men who have tried the challenge, and they look at the ingredients up on the board and say: "I am going to smash that."

'But then they see it come out on the big platter all heaped high and start to cry on the phone to their friends. They give up after about twenty minutes.'

The cafe even has a 'green bucket' which is brought out when a challenger fails to clean up the carnage left on the plate.
