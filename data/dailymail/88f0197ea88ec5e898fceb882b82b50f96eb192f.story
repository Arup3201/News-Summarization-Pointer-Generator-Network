Mario Balotelli is the scapegoat for Liverpool’s problems and poor transfer dealings in the summer, according to former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes.

The Italian scored a crucial equaliser against Swansea in the Reds' Capital One Cup win on Tuesday but the volley was a first goal in his last nine appearances.

Scholes recognises the striker’s performances must improve, especially in the absence of Daniel Sturridge, but insists Liverpool’s other summer acquisitions haven’t fitted the bill and Balotelli can only be partly to blame.

‘Another week of Mario Balotelli stories and I cannot help thinking he is an easy target. There are some players at Liverpool getting away with murder while Balotelli cops a lot of the stick,’ Scholes told the Independent.

‘His name, his reputation, even his body language on the pitch, they all add up to the kind of player who attracts criticism.'

Scholes sees the expected return of Daniel Sturridge in mid-November, who hasn’t played for Liverpool since August, as key to Balotelli’s revival.

Never far from controversy, the Italian was also embroiled in a spat with former Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey

‘Sturridge is a top-quality player who can take defenders on and score. I also think he will make Balotelli look a better player.

‘I don’t think Balotelli scores highly when it comes to the basics you look for in a striker – movement, finishing, work rate – but his form, the goal against Swansea aside, is just part of the problem at Liverpool.'

Scholes has criticised Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers for his summer transfers, who like Balotelli have struggled to live up to their price tags at Anfield so far.

‘Balotelli has taken the spotlight off some of the other summer signings. Dejan Lovren has struggled. Lazar Markovic has not scored and he cost £20m. 

'Alberto Moreno is quick but is yet to convince as a defender. Adam Lallana is the only one who looks like he is comfortable with the shift, and at £25m he was overpriced.'

‘I recognise Brendan Rodgers needed a bigger squad, but they should have gone for fewer players and greater quality. Balotelli cannot take the blame for all of that.’
