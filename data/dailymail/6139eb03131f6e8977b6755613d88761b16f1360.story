A mother battered down a bathroom door and desperately battled to save her daughter after she collapsed and drowned while having a bath.

Gabrielle Smith, 12, who was described as fit and healthy, is believed to have suffered an unexplained seizure and fallen unconscious under the water.

Her 10-year-old best friend who was staying with Gabrielle, known as Gabi, for a sleepover raised the alarm.

Gabi had recently been given the all-clear by doctors after suffering a similar unexplained seizure last May

Gabi's mother Faye Smith broke down the bathroom door at their home in Ecclesall, Sheffield, and  attempted resuscitation as her 16-year-old brother Zach dialled 999 for help.

Gabi died just three weeks after being given the all clear by doctors after suffering a previous seizure in May last year.

Her death on Saturday came just days after the second anniversary of the death of her father.

A first responder and paramedics arrived within minutes but the schoolgirl was pronounced dead at Sheffield Children's Hospital, where Gabi had ambitions to one day work as a doctor.

Ms Smith said: 'Words cannot begin to express the 
devastation we feel losing out darling Gabi - the light of our lives, 
beautiful inside and out.'

Gabi, a student at Sheffield's Notre 
Dame School, had been taken to hospital unconscious in May but had not had a seizure since and was given the all-clear at a check-up the weeks ago.

Her mother said: 'She was released the following day, declared fit, and asked to come back for a check-up if there were no further episodes.

'There
had not been another fit, and at that check-up appointment three weeks 
ago she was given the full all-clear by a neurologist. It's just tragic.

'She
was the light of our lives, beautiful inside and out.She was a bright, 
cheerful, vivacious, fun-loving girl who loved shopping, adventures, 
swimming and spending time with her friends and family.

'She loved every single Jacqueline Wilson and Horrible History book, and at school she loved history and science.

'On
a recent trip with school, she had written down her dream of becoming a
doctor at Sheffield Children's Hospital. We cannot thank that hospital 
enough for trying so hard to bring her back to us, and for the caring 
attitude of its family liaison worker.'

'Words cannot begin to express the 
devastation we feel losing out darling Gabi - the light of our lives, 
beautiful inside and out.'

Zach, a Year 11 pupil at the 
city's Birkdale School, said: 'I love Gabi so much and my 
life will never be the same without her happiness and kindness. I can't 
wait to see her again.'

Ms Smith said the family were taking comfort in their Christian faith.

She said: 'We believe she has been reunited in heaven
with her father and her heavenly father, and that Gabi will be enjoying
the eternal party she loved here on earth so much.

'We also appreciate more than
we can say our church families at both St Thomas Philadelphia and All 
Saints.They have surrounded us with love and care and kept vigil with 
us.'

St Thomas Philadelphia Church leader Nick Allan said: 'We will miss Gabi's beautiful face and sensitive demeanour, her friendship and her faith.

'The death of a young child is one of the greatest of tragedies that can befall any family. Our hearts go out to the whole family and her many friends.

Jane Willis, Gabi's headteacher at Notre Dame, described schoolgirl as 'a valued and loved member of our school community, a lively and friendly academically-bright student who was a true all-rounder.

'She was thoughtful and generous and will be missed by everyone in school.'

An inquest into Gabi's death is due to be opened in Sheffield.
