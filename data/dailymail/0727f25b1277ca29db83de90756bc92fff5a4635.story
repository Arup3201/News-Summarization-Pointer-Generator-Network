Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne says they will look to exploit Chelsea's levels of fatigue when the two sides meet in the Premier League on Sunday.

Chelsea return to domestic action at the weekend against the Saints, after being dumped out of the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday night.

The Blues were knocked out on aggregate 3-3 via the away goals ruling by French giants Paris Saint-Germain - in a hotly-charged second leg that went to extra time.

And Clyne believes Jose Mourinho's side are there for the taking - with Ronald Koeman's men having had 12 days to prepare for the trip to Stamford Bridge come kick-off.

'We saw them play against PSG and thought they looked a bit tired. Hopefully, we can capitalise on that,' the 23-year-old told talkSPORT.

'We are fresh at the moment and, if we take the game to them, we can cause an upset.

'If we play the game we can play, it will be a good game, and hopefully we can get the points.

'It will be difficult - Chelsea are a good team with quality players, but we are up for the challenge.'
