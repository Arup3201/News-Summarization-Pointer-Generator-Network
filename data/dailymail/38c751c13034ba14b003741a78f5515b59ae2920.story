A body, believed to be missing diabetic Peter Henley, 50, has been found in Tenerife

Police searching for a missing British holidaymaker in Tenerife have found a body.

Peter Henley, 50, from Dover, Kent, flew to the Spanish island on December 6 and stayed in the resorts of Puerto de Santiago and Puerto de la Cruz.

The alarm was raised when the keen walker and photographer failed to return on a flight back to Britain on December 18.

Television and radio appeals were made on the island, and a Facebook 
group was set up in an effort to trace Mr Henley, regarded as an 
independent traveller.

Kent Police liaised with Interpol and a 
tour representative to aid the search but it emerged that a body 
believed to be diabetic Mr Henley has been found.

According to 
reports from the Canary Islands, the body was recovered from a popular 
hiking spot near the coast at Los Realejos on the north side of the 
island.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said: 'We are aware that a British national has died in Tenerife.

'We are unable to confirm details at the moment but we are providing consular assistance.'

Relatives
of Mr Henley, a long-term employee of the travel and insurance company 
Saga, had previously told reporters that he was not depressed and was 
looking forward to Christmas.

Last night, as confirmation of the 
identity of the body had not yet been made, his colleagues said they 
'hope for the best, though fear the worst'.

Paul Green, Saga's director of communications, said: 'As the producer of the company's staff magazine, Peter Henley is a well-known and well-liked figure within Saga.

'He has been with the company for nearly 28 years. Colleagues were concerned when Peter did not come into the office after a planned holiday to Tenerife.

'When they could not contact Peter on the phone our HR team contacted Peter's relatives who subsequently raised the alarm with the police.

'Although Peter, a keen walker and photographer, travelled independently we have used our rep in Tenerife to help make contact with the emergency services, hotels and hospitals in the area.

'We understand the FCO have confirmed the death of a British national in Tenerife. However, as yet there is not a confirmed identity, so we hope for the best, though fear the worst.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Peter and his family.'
