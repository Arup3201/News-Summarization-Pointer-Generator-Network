A father with a passion for rapping is using his musical abilities to help his heavily disabled son. 

Jayce Correia from Danbury, Connecticut, shows in a heartwarming video the rehabilitative effect his singing has on his eight-year-old son, Jared, who cannot stand, talk or see.

As he passionately raps lyrics to a beat, Jared suddenly becomes animated cracking a big smile and even attempting to sing at one point.

Jayce wrote the song for his son in a bid to communicate how proud he is of him. 

'What you must go through every hour . . . I mean next to you I feel like a coward. 

'To me I think you're stronger than I am. And they tell me you can't see but I am worried 'cos I can,' the doting father raps.

Jared appears to listen intently as he’s sung to at home while sat in his wheelchair. 

He suffered a stroke in the womb which caused a build up of fluid in the brain.

The bleed caused various complications including cerebral palsy and epilepsy.

To date, Jared has undergone seven brain surgeries to help remedy symptoms and more operations are expected in the future.

His father says although he cannot comprehend much, he can hear and feel rhythms.

The avid songwriter said that he wrote Jared's song one morning while they were waiting for the school bus and it proved to be an instant hit.

'He was a little tired that morning, but as soon as the music came on, and I started singing to him, he perked right up,' the dad told  The Huffington Post.

Clearly, Jared wasn't the only one who connected with the song.

Ok little man ain't no time to cry. Chin up, show that smile! 

Head high, show them that pride. Plus you look good in your brand new ride.

Man I couldn't be prouder. What you must go through every hour.

The height of your strength is as tall as a tower. I mean next to you I feel like a coward.

They put you in a chair but I can help you stand. Anytime that your reach out, I'll always grab your hand.

To me I think you're stronger than I am. And they tell me you can't see but I am worried cos I can.

And wait until your older cos I can be your wingman. We'll be chasing all the girls while they're working on their swing dance.

For you I got big plans and like the gym in the summer you got big fans.

But you wouldn't believe the way your momma loves you. We can all see how she holds and hugs you.

You shine so brightly, will you be up tonight? Yeah, almost likely.

Do I get frustrated? Yeah I might be. But I'll always be there to hold you tightly.

And as we look at our steps in the sand and they don't match up, it's cos every time you fell I picked you back up.

Since the video was posted online, Jayce and Jared's mother Shirley Ferreira, have received thousands of comments, many from parents who also have  children with special needs.

One commenter wrote: 'Hi I'm a stepfather of a 17-year-old daughter that is mentally disabled and that also has seizure disorder. 

'I want thank you. It is hard to put in words . . . the emotion that we feel as parents.'

Another added: 'Truly inspiring . . . I find myself complaining [about] a lot about things in my life. 

'After watching your video it has made me feel grateful for the things I do have!'

Treasured moments: Jared's father says 'anyone who is part of a special needs family knows the struggles and the blessings that come with it'

Jared's parents, who have another son named Bryce, have launched a page on the money sourcing website Go Fund Me in a bid to buy a van equipped with a handicap ramp.

The vehicle will be used to help get Jared to medical appointments and outings as his latest wheelchair weighs around 70 pounds.

Jared's father concludes: 'Anyone who is part of a special needs family knows the struggles and the blessings that come with it.

'I know as a parent the frustrations that come with it. I want people to know that they are not alone.

'Life is not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can be hit and keep on going.'
