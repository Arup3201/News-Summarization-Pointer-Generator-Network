It's not uncommon for the victim of a burglary to feel unhappy with a soft sentence.

But in this case it was the burglar himself who decided that justice had not been done.

James Greenwood, 43, had accidentally made off with a mahogany casket containing the ashes of a Second World War veteran as part of his haul, and dumped them in a wheelie bin in a panic.

Acknowledging the anguish this had caused the family of the deceased, he decided the 20-month jail sentence the court gave him was not enough – and wrote to them saying he would let them give him ‘a good beating’ when he got out of prison.

Greenwood took the ashes of Royal Navy veteran John Clarkson along with other sentimental items and some valuables.

When he realised what he had stolen he
 abandoned the remains and the casket ended up buried in a landfill 
site. Despite a desperate two-day search by council staff, the ashes are
 still missing.

Last night 
the former sailor’s family said they were ‘absolutely distraught’ by the
 theft. And they revealed that the burglar had even written to them to 
apologise, saying he deserved to be beaten when he was released from 
custody.

Granddaughter 
Claire Wynn, 37, said: ‘No court in the country would send him to prison
 for as long as he deserves – because what he did to my family was 
unforgivable.

‘It was a 
disgusting crime. For him to offer amends by taking a beating was the 
final insult. We don’t want to hear from him at all.

‘It
 has been an awful time for us. The sentencing was on Remembrance Day, 
which is also my mother’s birthday. It was so upsetting.’

Widower
 Mr Clarkson, a retired labourer who died two days after his 91st 
birthday in January, signed up to serve in the Royal Navy in 1940. He 
joined at the age of 18 despite being unable to swim and, after 
completing training, saw active service on board an aircraft carrier in 
the Pacific.

His ashes were
 kept in a specially-made casket which contained a plaque inscribed with
 Mr Clarkson’s name, age and date of death as well as a family 
photograph.

Burglars broke in through a kitchen window at the house in Burnley, Lancashire, when Mrs Wynn was on holiday.

As well as the ashes they stole an iPhone, an Xbox, a stereo system, a DVD player and a tablet computer.

They
 also took a gold masonic steward’s medal, which had been given to 
another relative, and a watch that had belonged to Mrs Wynn’s late 
grandmother.

She said: ‘The other things which were stolen can be 
replaced but not my granddad’s ashes.

‘He
 put them in the bin. They arrested him on a Wednesday but the bins are 
collected every Tuesday, which means they were too late by just a day.

‘We
 called the staff at the landfill site who were amazing and spent two 
days searching through the waste to find it, but it was no use.’

She added: ‘It is very upsetting to have been burgled anyway.

‘But to have something that is precious and meaningful stolen like a loved one’s ashes is both disgusting and heartbreaking.

‘When
 my grandfather was in my house we knew he was there and there was part 
of him left and still with us. This is worse because we don’t know where
 he is.’

As a result of the 
letter, Greenwood was also handed a restraining order preventing him 
from contacting the family for five years.

Jailing him last week, Recorder Geoffrey Lowe told him: ‘For those involved, the distress you have caused cannot be measured.’

PC Nicola Heap, of Lancashire Police, said: ‘This must be heartbreaking for the family.

‘Finding out you have been burgled is bad enough, but to have something of this sentimental value taken makes it so much worse.’
