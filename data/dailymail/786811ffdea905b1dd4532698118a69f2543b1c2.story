A couple was rescued on Saturday after they were stuck treading water for over 14 hours off the coast of Florida.

Sean McGovern, 50, and Mellisa Morris, 52, fell off their boat on Friday night in Key Largo and 'were treading water without any life vests or means to communicate with nearby boaters,' WSVN said.

The couple was rescued by four men - including a Broward Sheriff's Office firefighter and two detectives - who were on a fishing trip near Hallandale Beach, the station said.

The couple's rescuers described their experiences to WSVN.

'When we heard their story, it was pretty impressive,' firefighter Keith Silvis said. 'Very distraught, tired, you could tell they had been in the water a long time.'

Morris' legs were cramped at the time of the rescue, Steve Crouch told the station.

'We had to actually lift her out of the water,' he said.

'The male, Sean, said he ran into three or four [jellyfish] stings during the course of the evening,' Crouch also told WSVN.

'We originally thought they were fish,'BSO Detective Adam White said. 'We got up close, and once we realized that they were in trouble, we brought them on board,' White said.

The couple's boat later washed up in Fort Lauderdale.Â
