A six-year-old girl has become one of Britain's youngest businesswomen after she started her own dog biscuit business which has now gone global. 

Anya Solomon-James from St Ives, Cambridgeshire, wanted some pocket money to buy ice cream, so she started her own baking business and she has now been accepted to sell on shopping website Not On The High Street.

Since teaming up with the website two weeks ago, she has received hundreds of orders each day from all over the world, including America, Thailand and Spain.

The pint-sized entrepreneur, who loves Scooby Doo and has a pet Bassett Hound Henry, has been overwhelmed with orders over Christmas and her whole family now helps with her business.

Anya's mother Rebecca, 30, who is currently on maternity leave from her job as a multi-systemic therapist said: 'It has been absolutely insane and overwhelming. 

'Anya started by baking a few biscuits to earn some extra pocket money, now we are getting hundreds of orders a day.

'We have been baking non-stop and now everyone in the family does their bit to help Anya.

'Her dad is in charge of boxes and labels, I help with the extra baking and her younger brother and sister  help to roll out the biscuits.'

Anya, who has a younger sister Emme, two, and a brother Charlie, one, is in charge of deciding the flavours and shapes of the biscuits.

She also does a lot of the baking herself, makes local deliveries and helps to answer emails and update her Facebook site.

She uses some of her money to pay for horse riding lessons and is saving the rest to buy a house.

Rebecca said: 'She now has more money than the rest of us and even offered to take us all out to Frankie & Benny's the other day. But she is very good at saving.'

Anya has come up with lots of special dog treats for Christmas, including an advent calendar with biscuits in for each day, Christmas pudding cookies and stockings.

Rebecca said: 'The Christmas stock has sold amazingly well and the cookies have been flying out. 

'Anya is very creative and is really good at coming up with the different flavours. 

'We also have lots of ideas for the new year, such as tins of biscuits and maybe some two flavour swirls.'

Anya started the business in October after she wanted to start having her own money to buy treats.

Rebecca said: 'She is too young for a paper round so we came up with the idea of selling biscuits.

'She loved the idea and came up with the name and all the writing for her Facebook page.

'We never expected her business to attract so much attention.

'Anya's a very confident and bright kid and the business is really helping her with money managing and maths and she has done lots of writing on the Facebook site.

'We've had to give her some guidance as she wanted to charge £10 for a biscuit at first, but she is now doing amazingly well.'
