A homeless dog that was so hairy he looked like the Star Wars character Chewbacca has undergone a complete makeover in the hope of finding him a new owner.

Chewy, a six-year-old Lhasa Apso, arrived at the Blue Cross dog centre in Southampton, Hampshire after his owners' circumstances changed and they were no longer able to look after him.

However, thanks to his wildly overgrown coat, Chewy initially struggled to attract an adoptive family - so staff at the centre decided to give him a serious trim in order to make him look more appealing.

Cute: Chewy's oddball appearance - including a wildly overgrown coat and prominent under bite which left him resembling the Star Wars character Chewbacca - saw him initially struggle to attract an adoptive family

Uncanny: Chewy was so-named because of his resemblance to Chewbacca - the Star Wars character portrayed by Peter Mayhew (seen here in the film alongside Harrison Ford as Han Solo, right)

The makeover worked, and Chewy was adopted within days of having his overgrown coat cut.

Laura Boyle, rehoming supervisor at Blue Cross, said: 'Little Chewy was such a hairball when he arrived - he was well overdue for a bit of a trim.

'We got rid of so much hair, he looks almost half the size and I'm sure he's feeling a lot cooler too,' she added.

'He's such a sweet little dog and proved impossible to resist now he's smartened up. We're not surprised he got snapped up by his lucky new owners,' Ms Boyle went on.

Chewy is, of course, named after the hairy Star Wars character Chewbacca.

Although a sensitive skin condition means he has to stick to a special diet, staff at Blue Cross say he is an otherwise happy and friendly dog who loves going for walks.

Lhasa Apsos originate in Tibet and were once used in Buddhist monasteries to alert monks to intruders.

As they were traditionally bred for colder climates, the dogs need their long coats groomed regularly in order to avoid looking to Chewy did when he arrived at the centre.

Official advice says it is better to trim a Lhasa Apso's fur in summertime to avoid overheating.
