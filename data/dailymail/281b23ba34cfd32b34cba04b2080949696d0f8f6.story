A woman who spent a decade trying every diet under the sun has undergone a body transformation in just 12 weeks.

Lisa O'Daly, 33, from South East London, struggled with her shape since her early 20s and has never managed to shift excess weight, especially around her middle.

After giving everything from Weight Watchers to the Dukan diet a go over the last 10 years, she finally got the toned, taut body she dreamed of after discovering weightlifting, and pairing it with a healthy diet.

Lisa's body fat percentage went from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, and she lost 2.3kgs in just 12 weeks

While her weight only dropped 5lbs from 9st 12lbs to 9st 7lbs, her size changed dramatically. 

The former size 14 can now fit into size 8 clothes, and her body fat percentage has dropped from 24 to 19 per cent, showing off her toned muscles.

Lisa said: 'I've tried every diet you can think of but nothing really stuck. At first, it was bizarre muscling my way into the weights room at the gym.' 

Lisa had spent every year since she finished university trying two or three diets a year. 

Her eating plans included the Zone diet, the 5:2 diet, weight watchers, Carol Vorderman's 21 day detox, No carbs after 5pm, Low carb evenings, the Ducan diet, and juice fasting.

But Lisa yo-yoed and couldn't keep the weight off, ranging between a size 8 and 16 over 10 years.

As soon as she was under stress she would turn to doughnuts, chocolate and coffee and would skip the gym when her job in HR got busy.

She embarked on the USN fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training

All her eating and exercise habits have changed and she's clued up on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle

When her friend Tarryn suggested she try the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme Lisa never thought she would find herself at home with bench pressing in the weights section.

But in just 12 weeks of the fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training she lost 2.3kg and developed a six pack.

The free body transformation challenge is based around a five day programme with two rest days, booked online, but the optional USN supplements and shake powders are paid for, available through their website. 

Thanks to switching snacking on Ben and Jerry's and Dairy Milk to lean meat, veg and brown rice Lisa sent her body fat from 24 per cent down to 19 per cent.

She followed a plan of daily exercise to tone her abs, arms and legs and tried out protein supplements to help kick-start her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8.

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Three courses of soup with bread, cheesy pasta, and a cake for desert 

Dinner: Large spaghetti bolognese

Snack: Lots of full-fat milk coffees, doughnuts 

 

 

Pre and post-workout whey protein shake

Breakfast: Porridge 

Lunch: Salad with grilled chicken, brown rice  

Dinner: Fish with steamed vegetables

Snacks: Handful of nuts 

Pre-workout USN supplements: Xedra Cut Slim Pack and CLA Thermo 

She took protein supplements to help her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8

Day 1 – Legs and abs (squats, lunges, free weights)

Day 2 – Chest and triceps (flat bench dumbbell presses and overhead chest extensions)

Day 3 – Shoulders (overhead presses and raises)

Day 4 – Back and biceps (barbell rows, dead lifts and curls)

Day 5 – Circuit with plank and crunches

Lisa followed the USN programme pretty closely, working out for 45 minutes a day throughout the 12 weeks, for five days a week with two days off.

She gradually increased the weights as she got further through the programme.

Week 1 - arm curling 2kg, leg press 65kg

Week 12 - arm curling 8kg, leg press 200kg

Lisa said: 'I'd started loads of diets, and sometimes finished them, but it never worked. I'd fall back into my old eating habits and put it all back on.

'I thought I was eating healthily and even went to spin classes at the gym but I still had rolls around my stomach. I assumed food was good for me just because it says low carb and low fat on the label. I assumed it was good for me.

'I wasn't obese or and people didn't look at me and think I was fat, but I wasn't happy and I knew that I needed to lose a few pounds. When I hit 11 and a half stone I became officially classed as overweight and that shocked me into action. But I wanted to do something that was maintainable which USN is.

'The weight came off really quickly and after just six weeks people were noticing that I'd changed.

'But it's stayed off too. All my eating and exercise habits have changed and I've clued up on healthy eating.'
