A 20-year-old ex-college football player is facing a felony stalking charge for disobeying a court order to stay away from David Geffen.

Jamie Kuntz was arrested in October and is accused of following, harassing and making a 'credible threat' against the 71-year-old billionaire philanthropist and music mogul between September 14 and November 14.

But Kuntz's lawyer claims there was no stalking, just crossed wires after Geffen ended the affair with the upset younger man and then followed that up with a restraining order according to TMZ.

The one-time football hopeful is due in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday and made headlines in 2012 when he was taken off the North Dakota State College of Science team when he was caught on video kissing his then 65-year-old boyfriend in the press box during a game.

Court intervention: Billionaire David Geffen, 71, has filed a restraining order against 20-year-old ex-college football player Jamie Kuntz

Posing: Jamie Kuntz was a promising college football player in North Dakota before he allegedly became involved in an affair with David Geffen

Multi-billionaire Geffen has been single since he split with his 28-year-old lover, Jeremy Lingvall in February 2012.

Despite a six-year relationship that included public visits to the White House in 2009 to meet President Obama, the pair parted ways because, 'the relationship had simply run its course.'

When the two began dating, Lingvall was attacked by some gay commentators and blogs for using Geffen as a 'sugar daddy' - because of their 41-year age difference.

Lingvall, now 30, is a surfer and graduate of the University of California Santa Barbara, although on a social networking website he described it as ‘The University of Casual Sex and Booze’.

On his Friendster profile he also bragged about ‘making hot girls swoon just to piss off straight guys’.

Once in Geffen’s life, however, Lingvall became a indispensable part of it - and accompanied him everywhere.

He and Geffen would also spend days on the latter’s two yachts including the 453-foot yacht ‘Rising Sun’ he bought from Oracle founder Larry Ellison in 2010.

Worth $6.8 billion, Geffen owns $1 billion in Apple stock and made his money with Asylum Records and later Geffen Records, launching The Eagles, Aerosmoth and Guns N' Roses.

In 1990 he sold Asylum for $550 million and founded DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenbury, after raising $2 billion in capital in one week.

Geffen also owns the 377-foot ‘Pelorus’ he bought from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovitch for a reported $300 million.

During their six-year relationship Lingvall enjoyed a life of private planes, yachts, parties and mansions with David Geffen

Powerful: Jeremy Lingvall was treated to a trip to the White House in 2009 where he met President Barack Obama and posted the picture to Facebook

Investment: In 2011 Geffen added to his maritime collection when he reportedly purchased one of Roman Abramovich's yachts, the 377-foot Pelorus, for $300million

The Pelorus, or ‘vast’ in English, boasts two helicopter pads, a swimming pool, an owner’s suite with 180-degree panoramic views and a staff of around 40 on duty to cater to its owner’s whims.

Music industry legend Geffen is known for his passion for art and supposedly has one of the best collections of post-war American art in the world.

In 2006 he sold two of his paintings for $143.5million, one by Jasper Johns and another by De Kooning.

But it was back in September, 2012, Kuntz caused a minor national controversy when he was kicked off the team after his gay clinch.

Movers and shakers: Some of his enormous wealth came from Dreamworks, which Geffen co-founded in 1994 with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg

Geffen, here with Bill Clinton in 2000, is a longtime fundraising force for Democrats and is friends with the former president and his wife, Hilary

He ended up having to leave the college in Wahpeton, which he attended on a partial football scholarship.

At the the tiome, North Dakota State College of Sciences said he was disciplined and remove from the team but it was not because he was gay - it was because he lied about his gay kiss.

Kuntz and his 65-year-old boyfriend were in the press box at the game against Snow College in Pueblo, Colorado over the 2012 Labor Day weekend.

Kuntz was videotaping the game for the team when the 'the kiss just happened', he says.

'People around here aren't exposed to it,' Mr Kuntz said of homosexuality. 'People expect gays to be flamboyant, not football players.'

A teammate apparently saw the kiss and told coaches, Mr Kuntz said.

Dismissed: Jamie left North Dakota State College of Sciences in Wahpeton which he attended on a partial football scholarship

When Mr Parsons confronted Mr Kuntz on the bus ride back to North Dakota, he told him the man he kissed was his grandfather.

'I lied,' Mr Kuntz said.

Later, he felt guilty about lying and came clean to his coach.

In a September 3 dismissal letter Mr Parsons told Mr Kuntz he was being ousted from the team under the 'conduct deemed detrimental to the team' category outlined in guidelines in the team's player's manual.

Mr Parsons specifically noted the manual's section on 'lying to coaches, teachers or other school staff.'

'This decision was arrived at solely on the basis of your conduct during the football game; and because you chose not to be truthful with me when I confronted you about whom else was in the box with you,' Parsons wrote.

'Any conduct by any member of the program that would cause such a distraction during a game would warrant the same consequences.'

Mr Kuntz doesn't believe he was dismissed just for lying.

'I know if it was a girl in the press box, or even an older woman, nothing would have happened,' he said. 'If it was an older woman, I would have probably been congratulated for it from my teammates.'
