Alex Song has paid a glowing tribute to Thierry Henry, hailing his former Arsenal team-mate as 'The King' after the France legend announced his retirement from football.

World Cup winner Henry was a member of Arsenal's 'Invincible' Premier League-winning side in 2004 and won the Champions League with Barcelona as part of their treble-winning team in 2009 during his illustrious playing days.

And Song believes football will miss the 37-year-old as he embarks for life in the studio at Sky Sports.

'For me, I call him the King. He was unbelievable. An amazing player and a great man,' the on-loan West Ham midfielder, who played alongside Henry for two years at Arsenal, said.

'I knew him from when I was 17 and I learned a lot from him. Even know he'll say to me you need to this and do that.

'So today, we miss a very big player. Not just here in England but in the world. Everybody knows his face. The things is did for football were good. So I just like to say thank you to him for everything.

'I learned a lot from him, will always be his good friend and I am very happy for. I'd like to wish him all the best for 'the future in all that he wants to do.

'He achieved a lot of things in football. That's why I call him the King.'

Song was one of eight first-team West Ham players to pay a festive visit to Newham University Hospital's Rainbow Ward on Tuesday afternoon.

Captain Kevin Nolan, Stewart Downing, James Tomkins, James Collins, Mauro Zarate, Matt Jarvis and Diego Poyet were there with Song to hand out Hammers goodie bags to young patients before posing for photographs and signing autographs for hospital staff.

'It's always a pleasure to do this,' said Song, speaking at the event.

'If you can give something small to the youngsters and their families, I think that's very important.

'It's something more important when you see a small child so happy to see us. If you can give them warmth and make them feel very happy at Christmas time, then that is great.'
