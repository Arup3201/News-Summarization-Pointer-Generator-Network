On a list of things we never wanted to know about  celebrities, it probably ranks as number one.

Children’s TV entertainers The Krankies have revealed their sordid past as secret swingers.

The former stars of hit shows such as Crackerjack confessed they each had a string of lovers in their heyday.

Thumbs up: Ian and Janette Tough, who play Wee Jimmy and Ian Krankie, admitted in a radio interview they have both been openly unfaithful to each other

When innocent youngsters had finished chuckling at the on-stage antics of Scots-born comic Janette Tough impersonating a wee schoolboy, she and her husband Ian  went backstage for some Krankie hanky panky.

At one point Janette had an affair with a circus leopard tamer while Ian carried on with the act’s glamorous assistant.

Dancers, magicians and musicians were among their conquests; and at the height of their fame in the 1970s and 1980s, they said, they adopted an ‘anywhere, anytime’ attitude to sex, listing golf courses and a cross-Channel outing in a 12ft boat among their al fresco encounters.

True, a 4ft 5in cross-dressing comic and a bloke who plays her dad may not feature among the nation’s best-known sex gods.

But the 64-year-old couple’s disclosure of the debauched lifestyle they once led rocked the world of showbiz to its very foundations yesterday after a wincingly candid interview for Scottish radio. Janette, famous for her portrayal of Wee Jimmy Krankie as a pre-pubescent schoolboy in blazer and cap, told BBC Radio Scotland’s Stark Talk programme they were openly unfaithful with a succession of partners.

Krankies’ tours, they claimed, were ‘wilder than rock tours’.

Having a ‘ding-dong’ with someone, as they phrased it, was routine. They enjoyed ‘a very active and physical relationship’.

Once they trashed a coach loaned to them by rock group Status Quo. On another occasion, they had a ‘ding-dong’ at sea. ‘It was only a little 12ft boat,’ said Janette. ‘We went out for Sunday lunch one day and we thought we’d get a bit romantic. We nearly ended up in France. He said he couldn’t make it last that long now.’

Of their exploits with other partners, Janette said: ‘We weren’t behind each other’s back. We knew what each other was up to.’

Their dalliances were apparently revealed when Janette noticed glitter from the assistant’s leotard on her husband’s body – and  Ian complained his wife smelled  of leopards.

Of his philandering Ian said: ‘We were in our early thirties and we got fame and went a bit berserk. Luckily we didn’t get in to the drugs, but we were wild.’

The couple met at the age of 18 and married three years later.

At one point they were rated among the most sought after entertainers on children’s TV, appearing on Crackerjack before headlining in Krankies Klub and their own long-running show. They were effectively dumped by British TV in the 1990s.

Curiously (thankfully, even) their current website makes no mention of the period they call their ‘dirty thirties’.

But it does feature a snapshot of their 2004 autobiography ‘Fan-Dabi-Dozi – our amazing true story’, in which similar disclosures first surfaced. In the interview Ian also confirmed that he once punched TV magician Paul Daniels in a bar in Jersey, where the duo were performing, adding: ‘But that’s not really a bad thing is it?

‘I think he must have said something to contradict something I was saying. I’d likely had a drink and was talking rubbish and I just went “bang”.

‘He went off the chair and the whole bar all applauded and said “it’s time somebody did that”.’

Janette said she was aware their confessions would shock fans  but said she simply wanted to tell the truth.

She said they had never thought of leaving each other.

‘But that didn’t stop us having fun with other people,’ she said.

Why court publicity about it now after more than 40 years in showbiz? Ah yes. They’re appearing in panto. And Jimmy is releasing a five-track CD. It’s entitled Dirty Wee Boy.
