Two experienced pilots who were 
sacked after a having a furious row in the cockpit were rightly 
dismissed, a tribunal has ruled.

Captain Stephen Bird had referred to 
senior first officer Stephen Akers as his ‘bitch’ before their Flybe jet
took off from Exeter to Spain, the hearing was told.

But when they encountered turbulence just before landing at Malaga, Capt Bird ignored his co-pilot’s request to avoid bad weather and a heated argument ensued.

'Fairly dismissed': Captain Stephen Bird (left) and First Officer Stephen Akers (right) were sacked from FlyBe following an argument in the cockpit during a flight from Exeter to Malaga

Akers called Bird a ‘control freak’ 
and told him to ‘f*** off’ before refusing to shake his hand after they 
landed the aircraft, the Exeter tribunal heard.

An investigation was launched and both men, who are in their 50s, were sacked by the Exeter-based airline.

They claimed unfair dismissal and took
their case to an employment tribunal where once again they sat 
side-by-side during the three-day hearing.

Bird claimed banter was commonplace 
between colleagues, many of whom are ex-military, and said his ‘your my 
bitch’ remark was said in ‘jest and a clearly jovial manner’.

He said he did not realise ex-RAF squadraon leader Akers had ‘found it offensive’ and later offered him his sincere apologies.

Flybe found there had been a breakdown between the pilots that could have put passenger safety at risk

Akers said he had been concerned about
the weather around Malaga because two weeks earlier his plane had been 
struck by lightning and severe turbulence.

The cockpit row was not captured on the black box voice recorder because it had been wiped on the return flight.

Flybe said any breakdown in crew relationships caused a ‘potential risk to safety’ of passengers, crew and plane.

The firm’s investigators said the two pilots, who had clean disciplinary records, had been ‘yelling at each other’.

Captain Stan Wood, who led the inquiry
into the bust-up, said it was ‘completely inappropriate’ for the two 
pilots to fly back to England after such a heated row.

He said: 'In my view, Stephen Bird did
not act as a captain should have. As the captain and commander of the 
aircraft, he had ultimate control of the aircraft.

'Stephen Bird should have taken 
control of an aircraft on approach to landing. He chose to engage in the
argument with Mr Akers which exacerbated the situation. Swearing at your captain during the flight is completely unacceptable.'

The pair were on a flight from Exeter (pictured) to Malaga when the argument broke out

He said Akers should have asked for 
another pilot to take over for the return flight, saying: 'He chose to 
put safety of innocent passengers and crew members at risk by operating 
the return flight.'

A pilot said: 'They broke the golden rule. If there is any dispute in the cockpit then they should not fly back together.

“The plane should have been grounded and a relief crew flown to Malaga.”

The Exeter tribunal heard that Bird and Akers did fly back together ‘in virtual silence’ with Akers reading a newspaper.

Bird said he did not think the aircraft should have been grounded over ‘a relatively minor altercation’.

Bird, from North Devon, said he had 
not found any work since his dismissal and despite his flying skills, 
said his future may be as a handyman.

Akers, from Exeter, claimed that some people in Flybe hated ‘ex RAF people’ and ‘patronised and humiliated him’.

Employment Judge Christopher Carstairs said he would reveal the tribunal’s full reasons for their decision later.

But he said: 'The unanimous judgement of the tribunal is that the respondent (Flybe Ltd) fairly dismissed the claimants.'

Flybe reported £6.4 million loses in April.
