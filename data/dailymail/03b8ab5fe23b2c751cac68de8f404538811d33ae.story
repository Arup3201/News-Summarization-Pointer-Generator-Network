A four-year-old boy has been hailed a lifesaver after using an iPhone to save his grandfather who collapsed while walking in woods.

Kanden Jones was spending the day with diabetic grandfather Carl in Houston, Texas, when his elderly relative's blood sugar became low and he passed out.

With the pair alone on a walk together and Kanden's parents Christmas shopping, the youngster was the only one able to find help for his grandfather.

Quick-thinking: Young Kanden managed to use his grandfather's iPhone to call his parents

Thankfully, quick-witted Kanden managed to use Mr Jones's iPhone to call his parents and alert them to the emergency.

The toddler tried to make a call but at first accidentally shot a video, before finally managing to dial and tell his parents his grandfather was 'sleeping'.

Kanden said: 'I was just running back and forth. I wasn’t afraid of nothing. I was crying because I wanted my parents.'

Kanden's father recalled the moment his son managed to ring him to tell him of the scary turn Mr Jones had taken.

Jarrett Jones said: 'I said, he’s asleep? He said yeah and kept yelling to my dad, "Hey Paw Paw, Daddy wants to talk to you. Daddy wants to talk to you".

'And at that moment, with my dad being diabetic, I knew something was wrong.'

After the call Kanden's parents rushed to the deer lease where Mr Jones had collapsed, where it took two hours for them to locate the pair.

The family then called an ambulance and managed to get Mr Jones emergency treatment at a nearby hospital before he was sent home.

Carl Jones said: 'I just really think it wasn’t my time to go. I think the good Lord was telling me, ‘Carl, you need wake up".'
