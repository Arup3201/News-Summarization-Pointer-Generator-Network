An American veterinarian's trip of a lifetime was ruined in September when she was arrested in East Timor after sharing a cab with a stranger caught smuggling drugs.

Since then, 41-year-old Stacey Addison has been unable to leave the southeast Asian country, and is currently being held at a women's prison as the State Department and members of Congress fight for her release. 

'Just to think of it, to think that she's in a cell locked up, 18 hours a day, really it breaks my heart to think of it,' Addison's mother Bernadette Kero, of Klamath Falls, Oregon, told CBS.'I'm trying to write everybody I can. I'll write the Pope, Bill Clinton - someone's got to be out there that can resolve this.'

'I just want my daughter home, that's all, I just want my daughter to be freed, to come home,' Kero added.

Holiday from hell: Stacey Addison, 41 (pictured), is currently imprisoned in East Timor, where she is being held as a witness to a crime. The veterinarian from Portland, Oregon was arrested in September after sharing a cab with a stranger who was caught smuggling meth in the southeast Asian country 

Addison planned the solo-trip to see wildlife around the world for nearly two years, and had visited Antarctica and parts of Europe before she landed in southeast Asia in early September.

On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab with a complete stranger, en route to the capital city of Dili, when she first ran into trouble. 

'The other passenger said he wanted to pick up a package at DHL and when he came out, the police swarmed it and she was terrified,' Kero said.

Wrong place, wrong time: Addison crossed into East Timor on September 5, sharing a cab with a stranger who asked to stop at a DHL office to pick up a package. Police swarmed the vehicle and found the package contained meth. Addison pictured above stuck in East Timor on October 20 

That package contained meth, and everyone in the car was arrested. Addison spent the next four nights in jail, and when officials eventually released her, they took her passport leaving her unable to travel outside the country.

'Police searched me, they tested my urine. Everything was negative, so I thought its okay, it will be okay - but it's not,' Addison said.

She remained positive since her computer records turned up clean and she had no criminal record.

State Department spokesman Jen Psaki says it's believed Addison is being held as a witness to the crime, and that they are doing everything in their power to secure her release.

But since East Timor just gained independence in 2002, their justice system is still in development which has hindered the drug case, leaving Addison lonely, frightened and alone and in a strange country.

The case took yet another negative turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and put behind bars in a cell. She is currently incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shares a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars.

Addison's lawyer Paul Remedios says he still hasn't received an answer as to why his client was arrested again.

Last Friday, the National Parliament fired all foreign judges and advisers in the legal system, including the prosecutor who was handling Addison's case. Remedios says he does not even know who is handling the case now.

'I would not say she is happy,' Remedios told Fox News in a phone interview. 'She is not. But she's strong and knows we are doing all we can to help her.'

The lawyer now plans to file an appeal to have Addison released on grounds that her arrest was illegal. According to the law in East Timor, suspects and their lawyers are entitled to know when and why and arrest is imminent, but Remedios says he still hasn't received a copy of the arrest warrant.

Behind bars: Addison's passport was seized after her first stint in jail, leaving her unable to leave the country. Her case took yet another bad turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison (pictured above) where she remains today

'Her human rights were violated,' Remedios said. 'According to our national laws there is a miscarriage of justice in the making.'

U.S. Embassy workers and her lawyer visit Addison in jail regularly, bringing her books and even birthday cake.

Her cellmates helped her celebrate her birthday behind bars on November 5, and since they couldn't give her any gifts, vowed to pray for her swift release.

Several members of Congress have been working to secure Addison's release, including Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley.

'We are in continual communication with the State Department and they are taking all appropriate action to respond,' a spokesperson for the Democrat said in a statement. 'Senator Merkley and his staff will continue to do everything we can to assist Ms Addison and her family through this terrible situation.'

Sending their love: Addison's lawyers and U.S. Embassy workers regularly visit her behind bars. Above, a few treats and letters she recently received. On November 5, Addison celebrated her 41st birthday with her cell mates 

Champions: Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley and California Rep Darrell Issa have both fought for Addison's release. Pictured above at the hostel where she was staying before her second arrest 

Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, also spoke with East Timorese government officials about the case during a visit to the nation on October 7.

Another factor which may speed the process of Addison's release, is the appointment of Karen Stanton as U.S. Ambassador to East Timor.

'East Timor has not had an ambassador in well over a year,' said Kero. 'We were told that the highest level Timorese officials would be more likely to talk with a U.S. Ambassador in place.'

Addison is also scheduled to meet this week with the former president of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, who has been championing for her release.

For now, Addison communicates with her friends and family back home through Facebook.

Addison, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and UC Davis was living in Portland, Oregon before she set off on the second half of her trip earlier this year.
