A Labour candidate has called for Myleene Klass to leave the country after she criticised Ed Miliband’s proposal for a ‘mansion’ tax.

The former Hear’Say singer took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate and viewers praised her for ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with him.

But she has faced a string of increasingly hostile comments from Labour members and supporters, with some claiming she should leave Britain.

Labour candidate Paula Sherriff said Myleene Klass should emigrate to avoid the mansion tax

John Clarke, Labour's candidate in Witham, in Essex, said Labour should squeeze the rich until 'the pips squeak'

Paula Sherriff, Labour's parliamentary candidate for Dewsbury and Mirfield, West Yorkshire, tweeted: 'If multi-millionaire Myleene Klass doesn't like mansion tax perhaps she should emigrate with Sol Campbell and Griff Rhys Jones! Toodle pip!'

Labour campaigner Chris Michaels added: 'I wish Myleene Klass would leave the country.'

John Clarke, the party's candidate in Witham, in Essex, added: 'The more Myleene Klass whinges about tax, the more Ed goes up in people's admiration: squeeze 'em till the pips squeak!'

Miss Klass was born in the UK but her father is Austrian and her mother is from the Philippines.

Former England footballer Mr Campbell and comedian Mr Rhys Jones have both spoken out against the mansion tax in recent months.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said the reaction showed Labour 'really are the nasty party' and criticised its members for making 'knee-jerk personal attacks'.

Mr Miliband and Miss Klass clashed on ITV's The Agenda on Monday night, when she criticised his controversial proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million.

But after Miss Klass, 36, won widespread praise for her robust challenge, Mr Miliband, 44, sought his revenge on Twitter by joking about her with his 357,000 followers.

In a reference to Hear'Say's 2001 number one single Pure and Simple, he wrote: 'Here's why our NHS needs a mansion tax. It's Pure and Simple', adding a link to a blog post where Labour set out the arguments for its mansion tax.

Nick Clegg this morning leapt to Mr Miliband’s defence and argued that the former pop singer was ‘wrong’.

Speaking on his LBC phone-in he made light of her suggestion that she would only be able to buy a garage in London with £2m.

‘She’s wrong on that. That’s some garage, he said. ‘What we need to do is get rid of the emotion of claiming that one person’s home is a mansion: why don’t we treat higher value homes [fairly]?’

‘What is possibly fair about a family who lives in a family home in Lewisham that they pay the same an oligarch?’

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.'

Miss Klass, who is thought to be worth around £11million, has been accused of opposing the mansion tax only because she is wealthy.

Yesterday she ignored the trolls, but on the show, she told Mr Miliband: 'For me, it's so disturbing. The name in its own right - "mansion tax".

'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It's like a garage.' She said those hit hardest would be 'the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years'.

Mr Miliband responded: 'I totally understand that people don't like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.' But former British ambassador to the US Sir Christopher Meyer joined in the debate and angrily told Mr Miliband: 'You're going to screw me royally.'

Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: 'Ed's getting a bit isolated here.'

Miss Klass interrupted: 'Ed's getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work. You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can't just point at things and tax them. You need to have a better strategy and say why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?'

Ed Miliband admitted he has problems with photo opportunities, and suggested Kim Kardashian could help him improve his image.

The Labour leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester.

Appearing on ITV's Agenda on Monday night, Mr Miliband held up a spoof newspaper front page, with the headline: 'Em plays the Kim Kard.'

It was a reference to Kim Kardashian's expertise at the photo opportunity, and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of Paper magazine, under the headline 'Break the internet'. The images sparked countless spoofs online. 

Explaining his front page, Mr Miliband said: 'You'll know she ‘broke’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity. 

'Now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities, me more than most, so I have decided to hire Kim to help me with the photo opportunities.'

Mr Miliband was widely mocked after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich in May this year. He suggested he could learn from Kim Kardashian, who appeared on the front cover of Paper magazine last week under the headline: 'Break the internet'

Myleene says you can only buy a garage for £2million – in fact it's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive

Myleene Klass joked that in some parts of London buying a property for more than the  proposed £2million Mansion Tax threshold  would probably only stretch to a garage.

But  in fact it can secure a mansion in less fashionable parts of the capital and  something even grander outside London - usually with a swimming pool, huge drive and extensive grounds.

However, the singer is right about garages being expensive, because last month one in Chelsea sold for an eye-watering £550,000. 

Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. 

This is what £2million can buy you: 

Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million.

A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue.

In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value.

This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966.

A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost.

Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax.

A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry.

And for £550,000....

This dilapidated old shed, which doubled for a garage, in Chelsea, has been snapped up for £550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer
