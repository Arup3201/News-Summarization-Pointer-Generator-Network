Canadian 'cannibal' Luka Magnotta left behind an angle grinder and an ice pick inside his blood-soaked apartment where he killed and dismembered Chinese engineering student Jun Lin.

Police discovered blood inside the fridge and on a mattress while searching the Montreal apartment where Magnotta, 32, admitted killing his victim.

Jurors at his trial in Quebec were shown a series of grisly crime scene photographs from where Magnotta dismembered his victim, before sending parts of his victim's body across Canada by post.

Canadian Luka Magnotta, 32, has admitted killing and dismembering Jun Lin's body while filming the act before sending body parts in the post to schools and two political parties. He is pleading not guilty to murder due to mental illness.

Jurors were shown a series of graphic crime scene photographs as well as weapons used to dismember the victim's body. 

Magnotta also left behind a note taunting his victim: 'Roses are red. Violets are blue. The police will need dental records to identify you.' 

Police attending the crime scene in Montreal discovered an angle grinder and ice pick. Blood was found in the fridge, on a mattress, in cupboards and in the bath. 

Magnotta filmed the crime and uploaded it onto the internet before fleeing Montreal for Berlin. 

It is reported the video shows Magnotta eating Lin with a knife and fork.  

Investigators found part of the victim's body in a bin bag along with a dead dog. 

Magnotta used pink tissue paper to wrap up the body parts he sent to schools and even to the Canadian prime minister.  

A claw hammer, pictured,  was also recovered from the scene of the murder and shown to the jury 

The jury was also shown a heavily blood-stained mattress that was discovered at the crime scene 

The court was shown several interior photographs of the apartment where Jun Lin was killed in 2012

The prosecution claims Magnotta planned the killing for six months before the 2012 crime, emailing a British journalist in 2011 saying he was going to kill a human being and videotape the act.

Canadian cannibal victim Jun Lin, also known as Justin, broke up with his boyfriend Feng Lin just weeks before he was killed by Luka Magnotta, a court in Quebec has heard. 

Jun Lin, 33, told Feng Lin, 35, that he was being pressurised by his parents in China to settle down with a woman and get married.   

Feng Lin, speaking through an interpreter, told the court that despite breaking up with Jun Lin, the pair exchanged 40 to 50 text messages a day. 

The jury was also shown a photograph of a heavily stained white tee shirt found at the crime scene 

Police found a number of knives and protective Nitrile gloves while searching the crime scene 

Police investigating the murder discovered this note that they claim was written by Magnotta

He told the court that he had cut short a trip to Montreal when his former boyfriend stopped returning his texts when he received a phone call from a friend of Jun Lin's who told him about the murder.  

He said: 'It was only after my arrival in Montreal that I looked at the first part of the video. I don't know how long I watched, probably several minutes.

The prosecutor said the jury will see the video allegedly made by Magnotta that shows the killing taking place in Magnotta's apartment.

Another photograph of a knife was entered into evidence during the high profile Canadian murder trial 

Jurors were shown pieces of pink tissue paper which Magnotta used to wrap up Lin's body parts 

Feng Lin said he contacted the police because the man he saw in the video was not Jun Lin. The court has been told that an unidentified man appeared early in the video, alive but bound and naked on a bed in Magnotta's apartment. 

The rest of the video shows Lin's dead body on the same bed, the prosecutor said.

Magnotta's lawyer, Luc Leclair, says he is not criminally responsible for the crime because he is mentally ill. 

Feng Lin said he and Jun Lin met in Beijing in 2009 and became lovers in Shanghai and then in Montreal, where they both attended university, but the relationship ended in May 2012.

'He (Jun Lin) was facing some pressure from the family. His parents were not aware that he was gay. He was trying to date a girl,' Feng Lin told the court. 

Defense lawyer Luc Leclair said that his client is not guilty of murder and is instead suffering a mental illness 

The court heard from the victim's former lover Feng Lin who said they broke up a few weeks before the murder

Feng Lin said the Chinese engineering student moved out and was sharing an apartment with a male roommate after Feng Lin left for China. Feng Lin said he was not aware if Jun Lin - who called himself Justin in Canada - had a relationship with another man.

Leclair said: 'I am suggesting that there are many things you did not know about Justin.'

Earlier on Wednesday, Leclair showed jurors boxes that had been used to send gift-wrapped packages with parts of Jun Lin's body and menacing notes to two Vancouver elementary schools and two political parties in Ottawa. One of the boxes appeared to have a blood stain on it. 

The trial continues.
