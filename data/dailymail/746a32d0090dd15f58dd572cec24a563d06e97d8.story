Portugal has pulled out of the Eurovision Song Contest, blaming the economic crisis.

It follows Poland’s decision last week not to take part again.

Both countries said the financial situation meant they could not afford to join in next year’s event in Malmo, Sweden.

Riot police clashed with protesters outside the parliament building in Lisbon this month after the government announced new tax rises and spending cuts to meet its EU bailout targets.

Portugal, granted £63 billion by Brussels to deal with its deficit last year, has missed Eurovision only three times in the past 48 years, despite some mediocre results.

Just nine of its contestants have finished in the top ten and its best result was sixth position in 1996.

Poland took its best place – second – in 1994.

Poland also withdrew from the 2012 contest due to financial pressures.

The country co-hosted the 2012 European Football Championships, and covered the Olympics and Paralympics in London.

Their best result was in 1994 which was the first year they entered the competition.

In 2011, Poland's Magdelena Tul finished last in the first semi-final.

Portugal is the only country so far that took part in the 2012 contest in Baku to withdraw from the event in 2013.
