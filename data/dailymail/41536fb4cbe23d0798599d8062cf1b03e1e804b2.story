The cyclist whose collision with a Connecticut woman ultimately led to her death has finally broken his silence. 

Jason Marshall, 31, said in a statement released by his attorney just hours after the death of Jill Tarlov that he is 'utterly devastated' about what happened, calling the incident 'an unavoidable accident.'

He then added, 'I am deeply, deeply saddened about the accidental collision that I had with Ms. Jill Tarlov last week and her subsequent passing.'

Miss Tarlov, 59, of Fairfield was in New York City on Thursday to buy her daughter a gift, when she was hit by  Marshall while walking through Central Park.

The mother of two was rushed to New York Presbyterian hospital where she was put on life support.

On Monday, her husband, CBS executive Mike Wittman, released a statement saying she passed. 

'My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable,' Mr Wittman wrote.

'Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion, and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by. Everyone who had ever met her was somehow made better by her company.

'Even though she has been taken from us far too soon, her spirit will live on forever. On behalf of our family, I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and request privacy during the difficult times ahead,' Mr Wittman said.

It's unclear whether her family took her off life support.

Tarlov also used to work at CBS, and the company issued a statement following her death, saying they would work to help prevent similar tragedies in the future.

'We are heartsick over the passing of our dear friend and former 1010 WINS Radio colleague Jill Tarlov,' Anton Guitano, chief operating officer of CBS Local Media and Peter Dunn, presiden tof CBS television, said in a joint statement.

'As we mourn the loss of our friend and console Mike and his family, we are committed to doing what we can to bring greater public awareness of the perils of unsafe and distracted driving by motorists and cyclists that endangers pedestrians. Far too many people have been killed or seriously injured on our streets,' the statement read.

Cyclist Marshall has so far, not been charged in the deadly collision.

Police say the Harlem saxophonist was riding in the park's bike lane when he swerved to avoid other pedestrians and hit Tarlov.

Phillip Fenton, 21, who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the New York Post: 'It didn't look like he tried to stop.'

Another witness, Tom Longman, told the newspaper 'The right side of [Tarlov's] face looked really bad. There was blood all over her.'

Marshall remained at the scene and suffered minor injuries.

According to the New York Daily News, an online training log shows that Marshall had logged speeds above the 25 miles per hour limit.

Cyclists are also supposed to slow down at crosswalks and yield to pedestrian, the Parks Department website says.
