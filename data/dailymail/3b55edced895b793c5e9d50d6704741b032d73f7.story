A drab brick building on the side of the A40, you wouldn't guess this storage company is packed full of priceless war-era artefacts.

But observant drivers that look up will spot there's something unusual about Vanguard.

Whether it's an anti-aircraft gun or an RAF Spitfire, sometimes even a double-decker bus, one of the incredible items will be tantalisingly placed on the roof for all to see.

Artefact: The Hawker Hunter, perched on the roof of Vanguard in West London. It is one of the pieces of 'junk' Mac McCullagh collected in years of heavy-lifting

Unusual: The veteran soldier and storage company owner places items such as an RAF spitfire plane on his roof by the A40 to brighten the days of passing motorists

It is the only glimpse veteran soldier Mac McCullagh offers into his emporium of cast-offs, which is his own personal collection amidst his client's belongings. Outsiders are not permitted to tours.

One of the prized possessions is a 
Linotype printer. Designed in 1883 by German engineer Ottmar Mergenthaler, it was once the treasured machine used to create the nation's newspapers, magazines, and posters.

A 7.3” anti-aircraft gun, weighing 17 tonnes, has made an appearance on the roof, decades after its debut on the battlefield in 1937. The powerful weapon was known to fire a shell to a height of 59,300ft.

And sat amongst the machinery is an original London Routemaster bus, abandoned years ago by the government in a crackdown on road safety and pollution levels.

Mr McCullagh's now extensive stockpile started as a side project at the heavy-lifting business he founded exactly 50 years ago with two fellow servicemen, Eddie McCormack - an expert in moving machinery - and Ian Sandeberg.

Festive: A giant Father Christmas was placed on top of the building in December. Mr McCullagh still has cranes left over from their lifting work to put up his displays

Emporium: The proud businessman's collection of artefacts was built up over years of storage. This London Routemaster was one of the abandoned objects

Priceless: This 7.3" anti-aircraft gun weighing 17 tonnes was introduced by the British army in 1937 in preparation for WWII. It fired a shell to a height of 59,300ft

Enraptured by the machinery, he began to cumulate some of the abandoned 'junk' they had to move.

Together,
 the trio orchestrated the transport of historic monuments including the
 Trafalagar Square Christmas Tree for 30 years, the 486-tonne Daily Mail
 printing presses from Paris, and the Victorian Engines of Tower Bridge.

Within
 a few years the firm diversified into removals, storage, and tropical 
plant sellers - and started up setting offices across the country.

Despite selling off the crane business
 long ago to focus on storage, they still have some bits of equipment to
 shift about the artillery guns and fighter jets.

The Hawker Hunter that Mr McCullagh lifts
 up during the summer months was one of the first ever used by the RAF 
in 1953.

And the RAF Spitfire was given to the trio specifically for the roof after they helped move an exhibition-load of craft.

For the festive season, a giant blow-up Father Christmas overlooked the busy commuters passage.

And when it gets too cluttered, he can always lift his own car onto the roof to clear space.

'It's just a lot of fun,' Mr McCullagh said.

Make room: Using some of the cranes left over from the heavy-lifting business, before they moved into predominantly storage, Mr McCullagh sometimes has to move his car onto the roof for space

'We always tried to say yes to clients so we did end up doing some odd projects.

'Once we had to move a hippo from Madrid zoo to Chessington World of Adventures.

'My highlight was meeting the Queen when we went to move some aircraft off the roof.

'We also specialised in the careful movement and storage of 
expensive precision machinery throughout Europe and further afield for 
decades, and the Hawker Hunter is one of the pieces.

'Putting these planes, buses, dogs on the roof... It's like a taste of the 50 years gone by.'

The fascination began when Mr McCullagh was called up for National Service in 1959, one of the last intakes.

Commissioned
 in the 5th Royal Tank Regiment, he started off with a troop of 
Centurions Tanks followed by a troop of Conquer Tanks.

Shortly, the colonel asked him to take command of Reece Troop, eight Ferret armoured cars, and two three-tonne vehicles.

Mr McCullagh said: 'The first 6 weeks of square bashing wasn’t the most peaceful but thereafter it was fun.

'Reece Troop in an armoured regiment is an exciting job; they are the eyes and ears of the regiment.

'I would be the first to confess that National Service did me and my lasting friends the power of good!'

Returning to London five years later, he was one of the three founders of Vanguard which started on August 4, 1964.

The company, now headed by Mr McCullagh's son, William, is compiling a book to mark the 50-year anniversary.
