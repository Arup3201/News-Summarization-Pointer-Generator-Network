A British man who went missing on honeymoon in Malaysia for two days after having a row with his new bride has been found today.

Jonathan Kemp, 28, sparked a major police hunt on Friday when he walked out of the Kuala Lumpur hotel where he and his wife Alyson Jackson were staying. 

Officers are understood to be interviewing him about where he has been, for how long and what the row was about.

Found: Jonathan Kemp, from Maryport, Cumbria, walked out of the Kuala Lumpur hotel where he and his wife Alyson Jackson were staying on their honeymoon

Jonathan Kemp, 28, and Alyson Jackson, 24, have only been married a week

Mrs Jackson, 24, said her husband was hallucinating at the time he disappeared. 

She has told The Star newspaper that they had an argument at around 11pm  after which he walked out.

'I tried contacting him on his cellphone but could not reach him,' she said. 'He was hallucinating before he walked out after a row.

'He didn't think he was in Kuala Lumpur. He thought he was back home in Maryport. I had to remind him where we were.'

She said her husband, from Maryport, Cumbria, had been seeing people 'who were not there'.

Mr Kemp, who has short, dark hair and had ginger-coloured stubble, was last seen wearing black pants and a white shirt with purple stripes.

Appeal: Mr Kemp was found two days after he walked out of his honeymoon hotel 

The couple were staying in the Bukit Bintang area of Kuala Lumpur, close to the city's buzzing entertainment centre

The couple had stayed the luxury Jumeriah Beach Hotel in Dubai before travelling on to Malaysia.

They arrived at their hotel in the Bukit Bintang area of Kuala Lumpur just a day before his disappearance.

Their hotel is located close to the city's buzzing entertainment centre, with its clubs and bars. Married for just a week, the couple were due to travel to Bali tomorrow. 

Last month the body of Briton Gareth Huntley, 34, from Cricklewood, London, was found at a turtle conservation resort in Malaysia.

He disappeared during a trek to a waterfall on Tioman Island, off the south-eastern coast of the country's mainland.

His body was discovered in a pond just yards from a kayak storage shed at the Juara Turtle Project where he had been volunteering, adjacent to a row of cabins used by rescue teams during the search.

Mr Huntley, who is originally from the Leeds-Bradford border, was on a sabbatical from his job in the City.
