A pensioner who shouted 'die you b******' after slitting the throat of his son-in-law with a steak knife has been jailed for six years.

Rodney Cohen, 68, had flown over from New Zealand after learning his daughter Jane's marriage to her husband 'was on the rocks'. 

Victim Declan Campbell thought Cohen was 'joking' when he first approached him with the knife and it was only when blood poured out did he realise what had happened.

Mr Campbell said the amount of blood 'was like something out of a Halloween horror film' and had to hold his jugular together with his fingers to stay alive.

Mr Campbell was rushed to Luton and Dunstable hospital with two slashed veins and a gaping neck wound

The 41-year-old ran from the house to a nearby pub as a laughing Cohen shouted 'die you b******' from a balcony.

He was rushed to hospital with two slashed veins and a gaping neck wound and was unconscious for 24 hours.

St Albans Crown Court heard the attack happened on July 26 after Cohen flew over from New Zealand when his daughter Jane, 43, sent an email to her husband saying she wanted to end their marriage. 

The two men had been to Sainsbury's in the town to buy beer and were drinking on the balcony in Harpenden, St Albans, when Cohen suddenly crept up behind his son-in-law, pulled his head back and cut his neck with the knife.

He narrowly missed his jugular vein and left blood pouring from a 10cm wound. 

When Cohen was arrested he told the police: 'I am sorry. I saw the knife and picked it up and sliced it across his throat.' 

He told the police the pair had been arguing and accused Mr Campbell of making derogatory comments about his daughter, who was away at the time. 

Cohen, who has lived in New Zealand since he was 18, and pictured here with daugther Jane, admitted wounding with intent at St Albans Crown Court in September and was sentenced to six years in prison

The court heard the couple had only got married in July 2013 after meeting four months earlier

Prosecutor David Stanton said: 'The first thing Mr. Campbell knew about it was when the defendant pulled him by the neck.

'He pulled the skin so it was stretched and he was cutting Mr Campbell with a kitchen knife.

'At first he thought he was joking. It wasn't until blood started pouring from the wound that Mr Campbell realised what had happened and he was scared he was going to die.

'Mr Campbell ran from his house and heard Mr Cohen laughing as he left. He heard him shouting "die you b******"'.

When Cohen was arrested he told the police: 'I am sorry. I saw the knife and picked it up and sliced it across his throat'

Cohen, who has lived in New Zealand since he was 18, admitted wounding with intent at St Albans Crown Court in September and was sentenced to six years in prison. 

Judge Stephen Gullick told him: 'You came over to this country because your daughter's marriage was on the rocks. You came here with the intention to go and assist this couple.

'You and your son-in-law had been and bought some alcohol. You then got a hold of him by the head and effectively you slit his throat.

'You cut the skin of his throat but you did not cause any injury to the internal organs which is fortunate but a matter of luck rather than judgement.'

The court heard the couple had only got married in July 2013 after meeting four months earlier.

Mr Campbell was devastated in August this year when his wife sent him an email saying she wanted to end their relationship.

He desperately tried to change her mind but eventually gave up when she told him the marriage was beyond saving. 

Speaking outside court Mr Campbell said he has not seen his wife since the attack because she chose to stand by her father.

The engineer said he had the 'perfect life' with IT specialist Jane, 43, and rejected claims that her father had travelled to the country to help save their marriage.

He added that three days before the attack he and his wife had celebrated their first anniversary in a plush hotel.

Mr Campbell, who still lives in the house where the attack happened, said: 'Jane and I had resolved all our issues back in February. We were just a young married couple very much in love.

'He came in and poisoned our marriage. He has destroyed the whole lot and I think it is because he was jealous of us.

'Jane was the love of my life. She gave me butterflies and he took that away from me.

'We had some arguments but they were about hanging the towel up or about ordering her the wrong meal. There were never any big bust ups.'

He added that he felt the sentence handed down by Judge Gullick was an 'injustice' and said six years was not enough.

The father-of-one said: 'The sentence was not my decision to make, but it is not enough and doesn't reflect how this has affected me.

'It is a total injustice as far as I am concerned. I was expecting him to get a lot more. He was trying to kill me, he wanted to murder me.

'I have had nightmares and the attack will always be in the back of my mind. It has shattered my confidence and I will live with this for the rest of my life.

'The amount of blood was like something out of a Halloween horror film. I had to hold my jugular together with my fingers to keep me alive.

'After the attack I secluded myself, I was ashamed and I didn't want to talk to anybody. I have gone from sky high to rock bottom just like that.'
