The disappearance of MH370 has been described as ‘deliberate’ and ‘calculated’ in the latest book to be published on the tragedy.

New Zealand authors Ewan Wilson, a commercial pilot and Hamilton City Councillor, and Waikato Times journalist Geoff Taylor, said they used a process of elimination to lead readers to the revelation that the tragedy was no accident.

Wilson told stuff.co.nz that the conclusion of Good Night Malaysian 370: The truth behind the loss of Flight 370 will shock the travelling public.

‘For the first time we present a detailed analysis of the flight, the incredible route it took, and who we believe was in charge of the aircraft as it plunged into the Indian Ocean,’ Wilson said. 

The book begins at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8 and weaves in the lives of the 239 passengers and crew on board what was meant to be a short flight to Beijing. 

Wilson, a former CEO of two airlines and with qualifications in transport safety investigations, said the men investigated each piece of evidence and eliminated all the possible scenarios until the reader is left with 'one shocking and unbelievable conclusion'.

‘The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 captured the world's attention and shocked everyone - [the outcome] is gut-wrenching,’ he said.

The authors travelled to Malaysia to interview authorities and family members of MH370's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah.

Taylor said authorities were not willing to admit the truth.

‘For the sake of the relatives of those on the flight the truth needs to be out there,’ he said. ‘We visited the departure lounge where families sat full of excitement and anticipation waiting for their boarding call. Surely they deserve better than a cover up?'

During a late night visit to the departure lounge Taylor recalled the moment his conclusion swept over him. 

‘What happened to MH370 was no accident,’ he said. ‘It was deliberate and it was calculated and it should never have been allowed to happen.’

Wilson said the March 8 mystery could determine which airlines passengers choose in the future. 

The authors also recommend immediate changes to the management of flight crews and the introduction of tamper-proof technical systems to ensure the aircraft can be tracked at all times.

Meanwhile, Australia has chosen a state-of-the-art Dutch vessel to help map the Indian Ocean floor as the search for missing flight MH370 heads deeper under water.

The MV Fugro Equator will make its way to Australia to work with the Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhena in mapping the Indian Ocean floor for the next phase of the MH370 search

Netherlands-based Fugro Survey will assist a Chinese military vessel in surveying the ocean bed as part of the next stage of the quest for the Malaysia Airlines plane which vanished three months ago.

The MV Fugro Equator, which is equipped with a deep water multi-beam echo sounder system, will work with Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhen to complete the mapping ahead of the underwater search by an as-yet undetermined contractor.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is now planning to comb a 60,000 square-kilometre (24,000 square-mile) search zone based on the plane's last satellite communication.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) stated that the survey would provide crucial information to help plan the deep water search for MH370 which is scheduled to begin in August.

‘The bathymetric (ocean floor) survey will provide a map of the underwater search zone, charting the contours, depths and composition of the seafloor in water depths up to 6,000 metres,’ the JACC said.

Fugro said in a statement that it expected its vessel to start mapping in mid-June which was expected to take about three months.

Australia has set aside $90 million to find MH370 - expected to be the most the country has spent in aviation history 

The Malaysian government has revealed it has spent just a fraction of what Australia has paid in the search for missing flight MH370, as officials from both countries prepare to meet to discuss the next phase of the mission.

But Federal  Treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia will pay its fair share in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

'It is understood that the plane went down in waters that are our responsibility, and there is a cost to having responsibility and we don't shirk that,' he told reporters on Tuesday morning.

'We accept responsibility and will pay for it. We're not a country that begs others for money to do our job.'

The Australian government has set aside almost $90 million for the search - expected to be the most expensive in aviation history - but it's possible that figure could increase.

More than three months have passed since the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard - including six Australians.

The Boeing 777 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, but an extensive search has turned up no sign of wreckage.

The Australia Transport Safety Board last week issued a tender to continue the deep-water search for the ill-fated flight.
