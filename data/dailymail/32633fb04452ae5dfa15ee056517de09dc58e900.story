An episode of 'Jeopardy!' has been deemed the  most difficult to watch after only one contestant was left advancing to the final round. 

After contestants Stephanie Hull and Brad King were eliminated, Kristin Sausville was standing alone in the Final Jeopardy round on Thursday night, a sight which left viewers shocked.

However, this is not the first time a contestant was left alone, it was the second in the history of the show.

An episode of 'Jeopardy!' has been deemed the most difficult to watch after only one contestant was left advancing to the final round. After contestants Stephanie Hull and Brad King were eliminated, Kristin Sausville (above) was standing alone in the Final Jeopardy round on Thursday night, a sight which left viewers shocked

Following the two cringe-worthy rounds of contestants repeatedly answering the questions wrong, it proved to be possibly one of the worst in history of 'Jeopardy!' (above Sausville and Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek)

Previously, a contestant, who surprisingly competed against Sausville's husband in the Tournament of Champions, found themselves in a one-person round, according to People. 

At the end of the cringe-worthy second round, Hull and King did so terribly they were left with scores in the negatives - King with -200 and Hull with -$6,800, while Sausville had $8,400.

This left her in the winning spot after Hull and King were eliminated, and host Alex Trebek could not help but admit 'this is not one of our greatest days' (above Sausville in the one-woman Final Jeopardy round with top U.S. government

She was asked: 'On August 15, 1994, 59 years and one day after FDR signed the Original Act, Bill Clinton made this an agency'. To which she answered incorrectly with 'FDIC', and lost $1,600 (the correct answer was the Social Security Administration)

Viewers shared their thoughts on the show through Twitter posts with one writing 'it was a bad episode of Jeopardy'.

Sausville, 34, a stay-at-home mom from Delaware, has played Jeopardy as a child and had the guidance from her husband, Justin, who was a six-time champ and 2011 Tournament of Champions wild-card semifinalist. When the mother-of-two found herself alone on stage, she said she was really feeling her nerves

Sausville, 34, a stay-at-home mom from Delaware, has played Jeopardy as a child and had guidance from her husband, Justin, who was a six-time champ and 2011 Tournament of Champions wild-card semifinalist, according to Delaware Online. 

And when the mother-of-two found herself alone on stage, she said she was really feeling her nerves. 

'It was more nerve-racking to be the only person on stage,' said Sausville. 

'On the one hand, it was nice not to have to worry about what anyone else was wagering, but at the same time, it meant that all of the contestant coordinators, compliance people and stage crew were standing around me.'

During the one-person round, Trebek announced the final category, which was U.S. government.

Trebek then asked her the question: 'On August 15, 1994, 59 years and one day after FDR signed the Original Act, Bill Clinton made this an agency'. 

He gave her 30 seconds to deliberate before saying, 'Kristen we're going to start with you,' which was met with laughs from both the audience and her, as the podiums next to her remained empty.

Sausville went on to answer the question incorrectly with 'FDIC', and lost $1,600 (the correct answer was the Social Security Administration). In the end, her two-day total was $31,601.
