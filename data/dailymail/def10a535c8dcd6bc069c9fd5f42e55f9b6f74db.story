Wales have been forced to devise a contingency plan for Saturday's opening Test against South Africa as George North battles to overcome a virus.

The Northampton wing has been in isolation from his team-mates and head coach Warren Gatland is preparing to wait until the eleventh hour before making a call over his inclusion for the game at Durban's Kings Park Stadium.

Should North, 22, fail to recover then he will join fellow British and Irish Lions Leigh Halfpenny, Richard Hibbard, Justin Tipuric and Sam Warburton on the Welsh absentee list.

Doubt: Wales winger George North is suffering from a 'mild virus' and may miss the first Test with South Africa

'He is 
still struggling, to be honest,' said Gatland. 'He felt a bit nauseous 
on Tuesday and he's unfortunately had a bit of stomach trouble so he has
 been in his room and had food taken up to him.

'He's
 making some slow progress and we will make a decision on him on Friday,
 or even later. We are aware that even if he does take to the field he 
is probably going to struggle a bit for  80 minutes.

'I
 am taking the advice of the medics. They say he is improving and we are
 hopeful he will be a lot better. It would be a big loss if he doesn't 
make it but we don't want to jeopardise his wellbeing and we have got to
 make sure he is well enough to take the field in terms of giving a good
 performance, too.

'If he doesn't pull through,  it would be someone else's opportunity.'

Uncapped Scarlets winger Jordan Williams is favourite to fill the potential void on the left flank.

The
 20-year-old has lit up the RaboDirect Pro 12 and the Heineken Cup with 
his dazzling footwork and has the potential to become a long-term 
favourite among the Welsh ranks.

Gatland
 said: 'I know there has been a lot made of Jordan's resemblance to 
Shane Williams in terms of skill and ability. He is very talented and we
 have not seen his full range of skills yet. There was a lovely offload 
in the game against the Eastern Province Kings on Tuesday, he can kick 
off both feet and he has a hugely promising future ahead of him.

'Hopefully we will see a lot more of him.'

Headache: Wales head coach Warren Gatland (pictured) is already without several other key players

Daunting: Wales travel to face South Africa having never beaten the Springboks in their own back yard

'We
 have been running the other options in training in case George doesn't 
pull through. We will probably go with Jordan or there is an option with
 Liam Williams and playing Matthew Morgan at full back. Cory Allen could
 come on the bench as well.

'Obviously George covers midfield as well and we need to think of that in terms of who would cover that area.'

Elsewhere
 Gatland has stuck with the same backline that started the final Six 
Nations game against Scotland. The midfield combination of Jamie Roberts
 and Jonathan Davies should be one of the biggest weapons against a 
Springboks side that are without their five top-ranked centres.

'We
 have a settled backline with a lot of experience, from nine through to 
15,' said Roberts. 'We have to utilise that as it means a lot in 
international rugby and we need to use that factor for us against a team
 with fresh faces on the wing and in the centre.'

Adam
 Jones will make his 100th international appearance in the pack and the 
tighthead prop will be hoping to mark his century with a first Welsh 
victory over the Springboks on South African soil. The veteran is joined
 in the pack by Scarlets flanker Aaron Shingler, who takes over the 
openside duties in place of Warburton.

'Aaron
 is a different type of seven,' said Gatland. 'He has played other roles
 in the back row but what he does give us is another line-out option.

'He
 has been in the set-up on and off for the last couple of seasons and 
it's a big opportunity for him to go in there and make the most of this 
chance.'
