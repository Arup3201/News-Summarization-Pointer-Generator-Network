This group of excitable youngsters need to learn to pick their battles after they started a snowball fight with a group of firefighters and ended up completely soaked.

Footage has emerged online showing a gang during Britain's latest cold snap causing trouble in what is believed to be Leeds.

The video shows a firefighter standing on a boat about to use a giant hose when a cheeky teenager on a bridge above throws a snowball that hits him on the head.

Catalyst: A boy on the bridge (top left) throw as a snowball, which is just about to hit a firefighter directly on the head (bottom right)

Fired up: The man starts his high-pressure hose on the boat as the group of boys crowd together on the top left of the screen

Gotcha! The litres of water start flying over the bridge and on top of the culprits as a member of the public looks and laughs at what is happening

Drenching: In a fight that lasts almost a minute, a boy is forced to hide behind a pillar while water goes onto him and his friends

His friends then try to hit the member of the emergency services with even more snowballs. Â 

But within seconds the victim turns on the pump on his hose and starts shooting water up at the offenders, leaving them drenched through.

Meanwhile the video, taken by a bystander, captures the laughter of the crowd watching as the boys get their comeuppance.
