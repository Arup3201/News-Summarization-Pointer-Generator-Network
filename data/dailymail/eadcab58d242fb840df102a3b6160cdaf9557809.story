President Vladimir Putin is sending an aid convoy to eastern Ukraine in spite of a warning from the West not to use it as a pretext for invasion.

Ukraine has said that 45,000 Russian troops are on its border today and Nato has added that it thought that there was a 'high probability' that Moscow could intervene militarily in the east of the country where Kiev forces are closing in on pro-Russian separatists.

Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, rang President Putin today to 'warn against any unilateral military actions in Ukraine, under any pretext, including humanitarian.

The Kremlin said that Moscow would send help to largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.

UN agencies say that more than 1,100 people have been killed including government forces, rebels and civilians in the four months since rebels seized territory in the east and Kiev launched its crackdown.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that he was in favour of an aid mission as long as it was an international effort under the aegis of the Red Cross and involving the European Union as well as Russia.

Mr Poroshenko said US President Barack Obama had also backed the international plan when they spoke on the telephone today.

The International Committee of the Red Cross had no immediate comment, although last weekend it issued a statement acknowledging the receipt of an offer from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about aid convoys.

The stakes have risen this past week as Kiev and Western countries claim that Russia is planning an invasion. Western countries say Mr Putin - who has whipped up the passions of Russians with a relentless nationalist campaign in state-controlled media since annexing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March - could invade to head off a humiliating rebel defeat.

Kiev said it was in the 'final stages' of recapturing the eastern city of Donetsk - the main base of the separatist rebels - in a battle that could mark a turning point in the conflict.

Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said there was no sign that Russia had withdrawn the troops it had massed at the Ukrainian frontier.

Asked in a Reuters interview how he rated the chances of Russian military intervention, Secretary-General Rasmussen said: 'There is a high probability.

'We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation, and we see a military build-up that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine,' he said.

Nato believes that any Russian humanitarian mission would be used as a pretext to save the rebels, who are fighting for control of two provinces under the banner of 'New Russia', a term Putin has used for southern and eastern Ukraine, where mostly Russian is spoken.

Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its offensive, undeterred by the presence of what Nato says are about 20,000 Russian troops massed on the nearby border for a potential ground invasion.

Kiev put the size of the Russian forces much higher. 'As of 11 o'clock today, about 45,000 troops of the armed forces and internal forces of the Russian Federation are concentrated in border areas,' Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said.

He said they were supported by 160 tanks, 1,360 armoured vehicles, 390 artillery systems, up to 150 Grad missile launchers, 192 fighter aircraft and 137 attack helicopters.

The leader of the rebels in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, a local man who took over the leadership from a Russian citizen last week, said that the fighters were considering mounting a counter attack against government forces in the next two or three days.

Mr Lysenko said clashes took place in several parts of eastern Ukraine over the past 24 hours, with six Ukrainian service members killed and big losses to the rebel side. Rebel losses could not be independently confirmed.

Municipal authorities in Donetsk said artillery shelling knocked out power stations in the city and hit a high-security prison, killing one inmate and allowing more than 100 criminals to escape.
