The Dutch amateur leagues look a frightening place to play if the Topklasse game between Barendrecht and Scheveningen is anything to go buy.

During the latter stages of the clash, Barendrecht midfielder Mitchell van Gastel was stretchered off the pitch with a broken and bloody nose after suffering a nasty whack to the face.

However, the injury didn't come from a flailing arm from an opposition player, instead it came from referee Wim Bronsvoort.

Bronsvoort ruled out calls for a free-kick by stretching both arms out by his side during the match.

Unfortunately for the man in the middle, or rather unfortunately for Van Gastel, he caught the player square in the face, leaving him strewn in the middle of the pitch in visible pain.

The amateur league player was unsurprisingly substituted shortly after the incident, although it’s unknown why a broken nose required a stretcher to take him off the pitch…
