This stunning frosty dawn may be nature’s final curtain to the dismal winter endured across the country.

But the beautiful red skies that greeted early birds in Wiltshire yesterday also heralded weather to put a spring in your step – with temperatures set to soar to 18C (64F) in the next few days.

For the first time this year it will be ice cream weather, as parts of Britain will be warmer than Greece.A high pressure system dragging in winds from the southwest means  the mercury may climb to double the average March temperature of 9C (48F).

Chilly start: Some areas, including Malmesbury in Wiltshire, were covered in frost this morning, but the mercury is set to rise as the week goes on

Blossom: A squirrel picks a flower in London's Hyde Park where spring flowers are beginning to come through

The squirrel nibbles at a flower bud like it is a nut as the sunny spells descend on the capital, marking the start of a warm March

Family: A Mother and her daughter play in the grass. The weather is expected to remained settled for the next 24 hours before the temperature rises on Friday

Still: Crowds walking around the gardens of Sheffield Park in East Sussex enjoy the uncharacteristically warm weather

Forecasts for Sunday put Athens at 10C (50F), Ibiza at 16C (61F) and Istanbul at 7C (45F).

The Met Office said: ‘Warmer, drier weather is on the way for parts of the country.

‘In
 the South high pressure will dominate, bringing dry weather for the 
weekend, with the best of the weather in the South East.’

Northwest England and Scotland, however, will be cloudy with patchy showers.

Clear: People flock to Brighton Beach in Sussex and set up deckchairs to lie back and enjoy the blue skies

A crowd builds up along the promenade as the sun comes out  . Some had to wear sunglasses to shield their 
eyes from the rays while one man opted to sleep

Pier: A mother holds her child as they relax on the pebbled beach of Weston Super Mare. The conditions on the Somerset coast are a stark contrast to the gale-force winds and rain experienced in previous months

View: As the week progresses, the deck chairs are likely to fill up as the sunshine becomes permanent

Spring officially starts on March 20, but there are already abundant signs that winter is over.

Daffodils and crocuses are in full bloom and spring blossom is on trees across the country.

Temperatures
 reached 12C (54F) in Bournemouth, Dorset, yesterday, where people took 
advantage of clear skies to head to the seafront. The seven-mile 
promenade was busy with people enjoying the warm weather.

John
 Lee, forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘The weather will be getting 
much better into the weekend. The south of England will be somewhat 
drier than we’ve  had recently.

‘High pressure is expected to dominate through the start of next week, with sunshine around and light winds.’

After
 the wettest winter in 250 years, flood water levels that have 
devastated large parts of the country are gradually easing, the 
Environment Agency said last night.

A
 severe flood warning for part of the Somerset Levels, in place since 
February 5, was downgraded by the agency yesterday after flood waters in
 the area dropped.

Just one severe flood warning remains in place, near Burrowbridge in Somerset.

A huge pumping operation continues, but drier weather means flood levels are expected to fall even further over the week.

Improvement: The Met Office has predicted the weather will be exceptionally mild for this time of year as the storms look set to be swept aside

Small
 businesses are being blacklisted by insurance companies because they 
are not covered by the Government’s agreement with the industry to help 
flood-prone areas.

The 
Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said its members are being hit by 
‘outrageous’ quotes for renewal of insurance policies – with some being 
turned away.

The FSB is 
calling on the Government and the insurance industry to ‘look again’ at 
the exclusion of small firms from the Flood Re agreement, which only 
covers domestic insurance.
