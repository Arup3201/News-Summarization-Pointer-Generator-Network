A young mother whose struggle with anorexia caused doctors to fear she would die just two days before her wedding says her recovery should give hope to young people suffering with the condition.

Kelly Furlonger, 31, obsessively tracked her food intake and became addicted to calorie-burning exercise, causing her to lose more than four stone in just five months.

She credits her partner Rhi, 31, and the arrival of their nine-month-old daughter Jasmine with helping her to keep her eating disorder in check.

Kelly Furlonger's struggle with anorexia caused doctors to fear she would die just two days before her wedding. She says her recovery should give hope to young people suffering with the condition

She said: 'At my worst, my doctor was monitoring my weight constantly. She noticed things weren’t functioning properly. A couple days before our wedding I collapsed while I was out running and didn’t bounce back. I felt terrible.

'I was taken by ambulance to hospital, and I was warned that unless I started getting food inside of me, I might not live to see my wedding day because my heart wasn’t functioning as it should be. Their main concern was that my pulse was extremely low.'

As a teenager Kelly, of Godalming, Surrey, struggled with alcohol abuse but found peace of mind through physical exercise.

She said: 'Sport was my sanity. If I was frustrated in class, the teachers would encourage me to do something sport-related, like making me run round the field until I calmed down.

'I was captain of all the sports teams at school and felt pressured to excel. If I scored three goals in a game of football, I asked myself why I hadn’t scored four.

'My best friend died when I was 13 years old. It was a very confusing and upsetting time. I always strived for approval and never felt as if I had it.'

Then, in January 2009, two years into her relationship with Rhi, her parents told her they were divorcing.

She said: 'I felt as if I was losing my family. I had bent over backwards to try and keep my parents happy over the years and it hadn’t made any difference, apparently.

'I’m close to my mum now but at the time I reasoned that if my parents didn’t like me for who I was, I shouldn’t like myself. That very evening, I stopped eating properly.

'I started obsessively logging what I was eating. I would make sure I marked down the tiniest morsel. I would get up at 4am and measure out, gram for gram, every single meal. I would cut slices of tomatoes down to the tiniest sliver. I cut pieces of ham until they were the size of my fingernail.'

By the time of her wedding to Rhi in July 2009, Kelly’s weight hovered around 7st, well down from the 11st 7lb she was just five months earlier.

She said: 'I was running and circuit training constantly. On the one hand I thought, "why am I wasting my life doing this?" But on the other, the fear of not doing it and getting fat was terrifying.

She said the arrival of her daughter Jasmine, pictured here at 9 months, who was carried by Rhi after the couple found a sperm donor, has placed a new emphasis on her future

'It wasn’t about appearance - it was about control. I felt as if I didn’t have control over anything else, but eating was one area where I was in charge.'

Her wedding day was blighted by her fixation on the amount of food she was expected to eat, and the couple’s honeymoon the following summer was marked by compulsive exercise.

She said: 'It’s quite sad that my thoughts on the day were centred around the wedding cake. I kept asking Rhi to not let me overeat. I obsessed over the wedding menu, counting the calories.'

But as the couple grew into their married life, Rhi’s support helped to turn Kelly’s thoughts to improving her health in a lasting and meaningful way.

She said: 'I looked in the mirror and realised that I looked gaunt and unhappy. At the gym I spent a lot of time talking to people about how to eat well and build muscle tone, and I realised it was time I followed my own advice.

'I had to become my own personal trainer. To build muscle, I needed to ingest more food. So threw away my food diary and started eating properly and forcing myself to eat square meals which included protein.'

Today Kelly, who owns a cleaning company and is studying a degree in sports science, is roughly 9st, and stays ever wary of backsliding into her eating disorder.

She said the arrival of her daughter Jasmine, who was carried by Rhi after the couple found a sperm donor, has placed a new emphasis on her future.

She said: 'At Christmas I wobbled with obsessing over how much food I was eating, but I’m able to vocalise those anxieties now.

'I’m happier in myself. I still struggle with confidence, but I’m much calmer than I was. Now I don’t let things throw me. Being mum for Jasmine makes me think about the need to keep healthy for her.

'I need to think about her view of things when she grows up. She needs to see me eating and being happy. I would hate it if she went through the same experience as I did.'

She encouraged other people who are suffering with eating disorders to remember their inner strength.

She said: 'I tell people not to be afraid to talk about what you’re feeling and how they might be struggling. I know I have to be vigilant. No-one’s going to be able to get better for me. I have to do it myself.

'I was determined when I was suffering with anorexia - I worked amazingly hard and went to incredible lengths to harm myself. But I discovered I could turn that energy around into a determination to get better and healthier.'
