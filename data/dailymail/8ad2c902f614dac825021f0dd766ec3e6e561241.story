Guilty: Thomas Dunkley has been found guilty of murdering ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer Shaun Cummins

A carer who murdered a former boxing champion and dismembered his body with a chainsaw before storing the parts in freezers at his home, was today sentenced to life in prison.

Thomas Dunkley, 29, killed Shaun Cummins, 45, before stealing more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight and storing his body parts in freezers at his bungalow.

Mr Cummins who was nicknamed ‘The Guvnor’ had received a £400,000 payout in 2004 following a road accident that left him paralysed from the waist down.

Leicester Crown Court heard 
debt-ridden Dunkley had given up his job to look after Mr Cummins - but,
 after two years, still hadn’t received a penny in return.

Jurors were told he spent over 
£10,000 of Mr Cummins’ cash after the killing ‘without a care in the 
world’, splashing out on a new car and clothes.

He also transferred £15,000 from a trust fund set up for the former sportsman.

But Dunkley was arrested when a 
suspicious nurse who used to visit Mr Cummins at his home told police 
she hadn’t seen him for days - and officers forced their way in before 
making the grim discovery.

Mr Cummins’ body had been cut into 
ten pieces and wrapped in binliners sealed with duct tape, then stored 
in three separate freezers - one of which Dunkley had bought 
specifically for the task.

The court heard that when interviewed
 by detectives, he claimed Mr Cummins had died of natural causes and 
admitted cutting up his body - but said he could not explain why.

Dunkley was told he must serve a least 34 years before he can apply for parole.

Judge Mrs Justice Dobbs told him: 'In
 my judgement this was a murder for gain. The dismemberment of the body 
was a grotesque act, violating Mr Cummins as a person, and his dignity 
in death.'

Death: Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins, 
45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight 
boxer and stored his body parts at his bungalow

Gruesome: The dismembered body of Shaun Cummin was found by police at his home in Saffron Lance, Leicestershire

The court heard that because of the dismemberment, it was impossible to say how he had died.

Dunkley, of no fixed address, denied murder but admitted preventing a lawful burial by cutting Mr Cummins’ body up.

He has also pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud, relating to accessing Mr Cummins’ funds after his death.

Mr Cummins, who also worked as a 
bodyguard for the boyband Blue before his accident, retired from boxing 
in 1995 with a record of 22 wins, six defeats and a draw.

He became the Inter-continental Light
 Middleweight champion in 1992 by defeating Steve Foster, then 
successfully defended his title a year later against Mickey Hughes.

William Harbage QC, prosecuting, said Dunkley, 29, and Mr Cummins met in 2007 through a mutual friend who ran a boxing club.

He told the hearing that initially, Dunkley was simply ‘someone for MrCummins to play computer games with’.

But Mr Harbage added: 'In the last 
two years of his life, Thomas Dunkley effectively became his full-time 
carer. By August 2012, he was a continuous presence at his home.'

The court heard Mr Cummins, who was virtually bed-ridden, received daily visits from community nurses.

But Mr Harbage said Dunkley was 
constantly on standby with to change the bedsheets, take delivery of 
medication, and run other errands.

He was also trusted to deal with 
financial transactions, as well as the handling of blank cheques from a 
trust fund set up after Mr Cummins’ accident. It still held a balance of
 £44,000 at the time of his death.

Mr Harbage told the jury: “It appears no payment was made to Thomas Dunkley for his time.

'He owed £16,500 to creditors, and at
 the time, his personal debts were increasing. It appears he had been 
hoping there would be some financial recompense, either through a direct
 payment or a share in the profits of a business venture Mr Cummins had 
embarked on.”

However, Mr Harbage said it was 
accepted Mr Cummins could be ‘strong-willed and overbearing’, and ‘took 
advantage’ of Dunkley, who felt ‘bullied’.

The court heard that in the days 
before the alleged killing, Dunkley told a mutual friend that he ‘had 
had enough of Mr Cummins and was getting away from him because he had 
wrecked his life over the past couple of years.’

He said: “In this case, we point to 
the background of bullying, the attraction of the defendant in helping 
himself to the remaining financial resources of Mr Cummins, and the 
desire to break free from the man who had made his life a misery.

'It may be any one of these motives or a combination that caused Thomas Dunkley to act as he did.'

Mr Harbage said that apart from 
Dunkley, the last person to see Mr Cummins alive was a community nurse 
on September 1 last year.

He added that it was impossible to 
say when he died - but it was ‘most likely’ to have been either later 
that day, or the following day.

The jury heard that on September 1, 
Dunkley carried out a number of internet searches including ‘what 
happens when you are stabbed in the stomach’, ‘how long does it take to 
die after being stabbed’, and ‘what is the fastest way for a human to bleed to death’.

And 24 hours later, Mr Harbage said 
he ‘intercepted’ community nurses outside the bungalow, falsely telling 
them Mr Cummins had been admitted to hospital.

The court heard that by September 4, 
Dunkley began using Mr Cummins’ bank accounts. In total, he either spent
 or withdrew a total of £10,819.

It was claimed that by September 6, 
Dunkley had decided to cut up Mr Cummins’ body, which had started to 
decompose, and store it in freezers ‘while he worked out what to do’.

Mr Harbage said he bought a chainsaw 
and incinerator, as well as overalls, dust sheets, binliners, duct tape,
 a face mask and goggles.

The prosecutor added that neighbours 
saw smoke and noticed a ‘horrible smell’ in the air as Dunkley burned 
items in the back garden.

He also bought a chest freezer as the
 two already in the house weren’t big enough to store Mr Cummins’ body -
 a fact he later admitted to the police.

Jurors were told Dunkley was then 
seen over the next few days by a several witnesses ‘without a care in 
the world’ as he shopped for clothes.

But by September 12 a community nurse
 realised she hadn’t seen Mr Cummins for days - and, after quizzing 
Dunkley about his whereabouts, alerted the police.

Mr Harbage said Dunkley watched from a parked car as officers arrived to search the bungalow - then ‘fled’ Leicester.

He was arrested at Wooley Edge services on the M1 near Wakefield in Yorkshire the next day.

Dunkley denied murder between September 1 and 9 last year.

He was also convicted of using Mr Cummins credit card and taking out a payday loan in his name in the months before his death.
