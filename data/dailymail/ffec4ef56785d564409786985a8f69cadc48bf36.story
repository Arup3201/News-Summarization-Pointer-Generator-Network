Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's old flight suit turned up in a Toronto thrift shop, but how it ended up on sale for $40, not even the former commander of the International Space Station knows.

'That's a mystery to me as to how it got there,' Hadfield wrote to the woman who discovered the suit, Dr Julielynn Wong, CBC reports.

Wong says she was browsing a vintage clothing store on Queen Street West in the Parkdale neighborhood of Toronto when she came upon a true gem.

'I thought, wow, what is a flight suit like that doing up there?' she told the CBC, but when she read the name , she got a shock.

'My jaw just dropped. I said, "I can't believe it."'

In the universe of modern space exploration celebrity - if such a thing exists - Chris Hadfield's star shines the brightest.

The first Canadian to command the International Space Station, Hadfield racked up over  1million Twitter followers with breathtaking photos shot from space of the planet below.

He also shot to viral fame through short videos filmed on the space station, including a cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity.

Wong bought the flight suit for $40, a markdown from $80, and wrote Hadfield on Facebook, having trained  in space medicine at the same Texas facility where Hadfield worked in 2012.

'He started asking questions,' Wong said, such as 'Well, does it have a puncture marks in the badge?'

After Wong said the suit matched several detailed descriptions that Hadfield offered of the suit, he declared it the real deal, though he couldn't explain how it had wound up in a Toronto thrift shop.

'Maybe it inadvertently got put in a donations bag or something. I’ll ask my family and staff,' he wrote to her, according to the Toronto Star. 'Glad you ended up with it — especially on sale.'

Wong, who has her own flight suit from the Ontario Science Centre Challenger Learning Centre, where she once worked running Mars mission simulations, is thrilled to have a piece of history.

'I can bring it out and share it with people. They can touch it and take "selfies" with it,' she told the Star. 'It’s nice to be able to inspire the next generation of space pioneers.'
