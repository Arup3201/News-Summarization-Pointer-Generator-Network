Oliver Kirk had to wear a bicycle helmet to protect his exposed brain from injury

A boy had half of his skull removed because of a simple sinus infection but didn't let it get in the way of his schoolwork.

Despite undergoing extreme surgery to halt the spread of the infection, Oliver Kirk, nine, from Abingdon in Oxfordshire, still attended school and protected his vulnerable brain by wearing a bicycle helmet.

The operation left half his brain covered only by a thin layer of skin and, as a result, he had to wear the helmet for five months.

However, two weeks ago he had surgery to place a ceramic skull replacement over the gap.

He is now free of the helmet and looking forward to playing sport again.

Oliver's initial infection was common - sinusitis causes the chambers above the nose to swell and become painful.

It typically causes a high temperature, pain and tenderness in the face, and a blocked or runny nose.

The majority of people take over-the-counter medications and the infection clears up on its own.

When the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone.

However,
in very rare cases  - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the
area surrounding the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain.

His mother, Liz, and father, David, first noticed something was wrong in February when Oliver's eyes began to droop and he suffered headaches. This was because his brain was beginning to swell and push against his eyes.

His condition rapidly deteriorated and surgeons were forced to painstakingly cut away the entire left side of his skull.

Doctors 'cleaned' his brain of infection but were concerned that potentially 
fatal bacteria had spread into his skull bone, so decided not to replace 
it after surgery.

Oliver underwent surgery to remove half his skull because a usually harmless sinus infection spread to the bone in his skull, and to his brain

Oliver was back on his 
feet within weeks, but with only his skin covering his brain he had to 
wear a helmet to protect his 'squidgy' head.

Two weeks ago he went under the knife again to allow doctors to fit a new custom-made ceramic skull implant.

Oliver said: 'An infection went
up my nose and under my skull so they had to take the skull out, and 
they then stitched the skin back over so you couldn't see the inside.

'At first I thought "Where has it gone?"
and then my mum told me and I was really shocked. It felt really weird.
It was really squidgy and jelly.'

Sinusitis is inflammation of the lining of the sinuses, caused by a viral or bacterial infection.

The sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind the cheekbones and forehead.

Sinusitis typically causes a high temperature, pain and tenderness in the face, and a blocked or runny nose.

It is a common, usually harmless, condition and can affect people of any age

Complications of sinusitis are more common in children than in adults.

If a child has sinusitis and swelling around the cheekbone or eyelid, it may be a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue or an infection of the tissue surrounding the eye. 

When the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone.

However, in very rare cases - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the area surrounding the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain. This can be fatal unless treated quickly.

He added: 'When the skull wasn't there it was like a blancmange, because it was all squidgy, and there was only fluid there, and it wasn't symmetrical like heads sould be.'

Oliver was on holiday with his parents, and brother Christian, 14, in February, when he developed a temperature.

Surgeons at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford discovered an infection had moved from his sinuses to his brain and was putting pressure on his skull.

He was rushed into surgery and doctors worked against the clock to catch the infection before it permanently damaged his brain.

He was in an induced coma for three days, but after a few weeks in bed he was back on his feet.

His mother said: 'He went back to school and he could do anything apart from sport.

'He had to wear his protective helmet right up until two weeks ago.

'He then underwent surgery to have a "ceramic" skull replacement fitted. The material, which is similar in tecture to coral, is porous.

'This means that as Ollie’s skull grows it will fuse with the synthetic bone, healing over the hole.

'Because the skull implant will be able to grow with Ollie, it will not restrict the growth of his brain and affect his development.

'He was really good about it and got 
used to it. His attitude and his positive approach over the last few 
months has been a lesson to us all really.'

Surgeons believe it is the first time the operation has been carried out in the UK in response to an infection, instead of trauma.

They hope it will eventually fuse with his remaining bits of skull.

Neurosurgeon Dr Shailendra Magdum said: 'Ollie's case is, I think, the first case in this country to use this material.'

Oliver Kirk, from Oxfordshire, developed sinusitis that spread to his brain

Surgeons 'cleaned' his brain but were concerned his skull remained infected so left one side of his brain without bone covering it

Because this left only a thin layer of skin over his brain, he wore a bicycle helmet to prevent his 'squidgy head' being knocked and damaged
