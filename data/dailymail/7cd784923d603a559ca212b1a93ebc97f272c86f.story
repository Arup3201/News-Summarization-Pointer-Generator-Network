A mansion near San Diego where millionaire Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend and six-year-old son died in 2011 is about to go on sale for $16.9 million, it has emerged.

The 10-bedroom oceanfront home in Coronado will reportedly be listed in the next four to six weeks.

Shacknai, the CEO and founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., owns the historic house known as Spreckels Mansion, and has carried out extensive renovations since the tragedies.

In July 2011, Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau was found bound and hanging from the mansion's balcony two days after Shacknai's son Max was fatally injured after falling down the stairs.

Investigators called Max's death an accident and Zahau's a suicide, but Max's mother and Zahau's family have both called the deaths suspicious.

Scott Aurich, of Pacific Sothebyâ€™s International Realty, told U-T San Diego the home has received a top-to-bottom renovation, but no changes have been made to the balcony where Zahau was found.

The renovations were carried out after Shacknai entered into a deal with a group of investors, but Aurich would not disclose the nature of the deal or the people involved.

The updates include a new roof, refurbished wood flooring and improvements to several rooms, including the master bedroom and the kitchen, U-T San Diego reported.

Tragic: Max Shacknai, six, died after he fell down the stairs at the home. Days later, Rebecca Zahau, the girlfriend of Max's father, was found bound and hanged from an outside balcony at the mansion

Lavish: The oceanfront, historic home near San Diego has 10 bedrooms and 9-and-a-half bathrooms

Shacknai bought the 10-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom home for $12.75 million in March 2007.

The listing describes the property as 'one of the premier oceanfront beach 
compounds in all of Southern California... overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches in the world!'

The home gets its name from John D. Spreckels, a sugar baron who was once the wealthiest man in San Diego and who financed the home more than a century ago.

The mansion hit headlines two years ago for the deaths, which have been deemed suspicious by family members of the deceased.

Max Shacknai's mother Dina Shacknai, who had a turbulent relationship with his father, was so unconvinced that her son's death was an accident that she hired her own team of investigators.

They reported that her son's death was not an accident.

'He was a victim of assault and a victim of homicide,' Dina Shacknai told NBC News last August. 'Even though nothing will bring my only child Maxie back, I owe it to him, as his mother, to make sure the true facts of his death are known.'

The official police investigation into the death of Max found that the boy tumbled over a railing and fell down the stairs.

The little boy is said to have hit the carpeted floor face first which fractured his forehead and when paramedics arrived he was not breathing and did not have a pulse.

Questions: Max's mother, Dina Shacknai, hired investigators who said he had been assaulted and killed

He died one week later at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.

Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death, but her family members said it was 'preposterous' she would be involved in his death.

Zahau was found by Jonah Shacknai hanging from an outside balcony at the home days after Max's tragic fall. She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound.

Zahau's family has also commissioned their own private investigation. Her sister said she spoke with her the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life.
