Chilling: Rick J. Jones is accused of stabbing his friend several times after an argument 

This terrifying mugshot shows the man accused of stabbing his friend multiple times and leaving him covered in blood as he went on the run in West Virginia last week.

Rick J. Jones, 33, of the Frog Level Section of Coalwood, McDowell County, was snapped peering into the camera with just one eye open, the rest of his face appearing bruised, scabbed and contorted.

He is said to have launched the brutal attack following a verbal altercation while at his friend's house on Friday night.

The victim, Kevin Ross, suffered lacerations to his lower torso, his left side, his back and the lower part of his right arm and 'had blood covering most of his body.

Police found the victim in the seriously injured state, accompanied by his wife, after they were called out at 11pm.    

After allegedly stabbing his friend several times, Jones made his way to a house belonging to his father, Rick L Jones, before leaving the property armed with a .40 caliber handgun - just minutes before police arrived.

Following a manhunt which went on throughout the night, Jones returned to his father's house on Saturday morning - where he was arrested by police, The Register Herald reports. 

He has been charged with malicious wounding, domestic assault, domestic battery and brandishing and is currently in custody at the McDowell County holding facility.

He appeared for his arraignment on Saturday before McDowell County Magistrate, Steve Cox, who set his bond at $25,000 cash and property.  

The McDowell County EMS Authority took Mr Ross to Welch Community Hospital where he received initial treatment, before being transported to Charleston Area Medical Center.

Troopers R.W. Justus and C.A. Dunn, both of the Welch Detachment of the West Virginia State Police, were the police officers on call.

The say they have heard several possible motives for the savage attack, but are not yet speculating as to what may have prompted the alleged stabbing.
