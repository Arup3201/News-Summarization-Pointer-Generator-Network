An 87-year-old Maryland man has been killed by his pit bull at home as he took down the family Christmas tree, according to police in Frederick County.

Police and animal control were called to the home of Eugene Smith on Wednesday last week and found the 84-pound rescue dog still mauling him.

They managed to pull the dog off from the attack but it was too late for Smith, who was taken to hospital where he he later succumbed to his injuries.

The dog was taken to an animal shelter where it was later destroyed.

The Frederick County Sheriff's Office said that Smith was lying on the ground taking the tree down when the dog attacked him. 

Deputies said that the dog was a stray who Smith had taken in to his rural home, where he lived with his son and his son's fianceé.

Smith, who still worked as a milk delivery truck driver, was said to love his canine companion and his friends told WJLA that it would sometimes sleep in the same bed as him.

Sgt. David Luckenbaugh with Frederick County Animal Control said that they had no complaints from neighbors about the dog.

'We had no call history to that address, no complaints involving that dog and the dog didn't come in through our shelter,' said Luckenbaugh to the Frederick News Post.

'Our initial indications are that the attack was unprovoked, the victim didn't do any specific thing to cause that to happen.'

His colleagues said that Smith, or Smitty had worked for more than 60 years and that the animal lover would keep a stash of biscuits for all the cats and dogs that lived along his route from Maryland to Wisconsin.

Medical examiners said that Smith suffered severe injuries to his head and upper body.

Luckenbaugh told the Frederick News Post that his officers were working to discover where Smith took the dog in from and who previously owned it, but said that there would be no charges.

According to Opposing Views, pit bulls are more than six times as likely to attack their owner as any other breed.

This is known as Pit Disloyalty Phenomenon (PDP) and has been known about by the canine lobby for 25 years.

However, the pro-pit bull lobby has said that this is nonsense and the breed suffers from poor PR.
