The family of a U.S. Open tennis referee charged with killing her husband of nearly 50 years with a coffee mug is lashing out against investigators' claims that she was having an affair.

The daughter of 70-year-old Lois Goodman was quick to her mother's defense on Tuesday, days after her attorney reported Goodman passing a polygraph test questioning her in her husband’s death last April in Los Angeles, California.

'There was no affair. It was completely made up,' her daughter Allison Goodman Rogers told ABC on Tuesday night.

Speaking out: Allison Goodman Rogers, the daughter of Lois Goodman was quick to defend her mother on allegations she was having an affair at the time of her husband's bizarre death

Accused: Lois Ann Goodman, seen after her arrest in New York, denies killing her elderly husband at their home in Los Angeles, California in April

'She has a huge heart, and everything that's been in the press has been very negative. It's not her,' she said.

Admittedly the question on Goodman's fidelity is one her attorney says wasn't asked during her polygraph test.

Defense Attorney Alison Triessl instead described it as 'non-essential.'

'The question was whether or not she murdered her husband and the answer was no,' Mrs Triessl told ABC.

On April 17, 80-year-old Alan Goodman
as found dead in the couple's home after what authorities first 
believed was him falling down the stairs.

They
began to suspect foul play after a mortuary reported suspicious 
injuries on Mr Goodman's head, including glass fragments with a 
blood-covered coffee mug found nearby.

Passed the test: Seen left of Goodman's daughter and her son-in-law, defense attorney Alison Triessl said her client passed a lie detector test but admitted she wasn't asked about her fidelity

Unrelated: Mrs Triessl said the question of whether or not Goodman was having an affair at the time of her husband's death has no relation to her alleged crimes

'She surmised that he must have had a heart attack and fallen down the stairs,' Lt David Storaker of the Los Angeles Police Department told ABC.

The claims of the tennis referee
having an affair allegedly started after police found emails and handwritten letters to 
another man during a search of the house.

'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said
of an interview four days after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to
what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a 
grieving spouse.'

On August 2, Mr Goodman's death was ruled a homicide by the Los Angeles County Coroner.

'They've been depicting my mom as this cold-blooded person, and it couldn't be further from the truth,' Goodman's daughter said.

Goodman's
lawyers sent the results of the lie detector test to the district 
attorney's office in the hope that prosecutors will re-evaluate the case
and consider dismissing the charges against the 70-year-old.

The
referee initially refused to undertake a lie detector test following 
her husband's death on the advice of her former counsel, according to 
attorneys Alison Triessl and Robert Sheahen.

They added that she has now fulfilled the request and passed 'with flying colours'.

'I'm hopeful that they are going to reassess their case,' Ms Triessl told the Associated Press.

'The results of the polygraph prove Lois Goodman did not kill her husband, he died in a freak accident.'

The district attorney's office said it would not comment before the material is brought up in court.

Goodman
was arrested in New York on August 21 shortly before she was due to 
referee at a U.S. Open tennis match.

Goodman, 70, was released to home confinement in California after her attorneys successfully argued for a bail reduction

Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A.

She
was released to home confinement in California after paying bail of 
$500,000. The security had been reduced from $1million. The commissioner 
cited Goodman's lack of criminal record and strong ties to her community
in making the decision.

Goodman's daughter has described the allegations against her mother as 'completely ridiculous'.

The
prosecution has claimed Mr Goodman was struck 10 times on the head, and
argued there was evidence of his wife's pre-meditation and lack of 
remorse.

Prosecutor Sharon 
Ransom previously told a judge that Goodman went to get a manicure while
her husband lay dying.

But defence attorney Alison Triessl has claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, 
hearing loss and constant spinal pain that's controlled by an electronic
device implanted in her spine.

Scene: Alan Goodman was found dead at the couple's condominium on April 17 in Woodland Hills, pictured

She 
had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading 
upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood.

She followed the blood to her
bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the 
affidavit. She then dialled 911.

Investigators
also believed a large bloodstain near the stairs suggested he had 
suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said.

When
she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had 
been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, 
Goodman has protested her innocence.

She
has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years and has umpired
with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with 
Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.

In
a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is
my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best 
players. There's no real way to describe it.'
