After a solitary year at Liverpool ended with just eight appearances, it's safe to say that not many fans would have been expecting Gabriel Paletta to star at a World Cup.

But eight years after his fateful season on Merseyside, the Argentine-born defender could be tasked with stopping his former team-mates with in Brazil.

England take on Italy in their first group game in Manaus, and will be wary of the presence of Mario Balotelli and the guile of Andrea Pirlo. But what about another man included in the 30-man provisional squad, Paletta?

Surprise: Gabriel Paletta was included in Italy's 30-man provisional World Cup squad

Eight years ago: And Paletta was signing on the dotted line at Liverpool, as a 20-year-old hopeful

Aged just 20, Paletta made the brave decision to join Liverpool in a £2million move from hometown club Banfield. Labelled as one for the future after starring in the Under 20 World Championships alongside Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, the South American signed a four-year contract.

'Paletta is very tough and he's exactly the sort of player we need who will suit the Premiership,' Rafael Benitez said back in the summer of 2006.

'If you're talking about Liverpool, he's more like 'Carra' (Jamie Carragher) than Sami Hyypia.'

Unfortunately for Paletta, he struggled to settle in England and played just three times in the Premier League, though he did manage to score in a League Cup game.

A return to Argentina followed with domestic giants Boca Juniors benefitting from some solid displays, but it was Paletta's next move that has seen him thrust back into the English spotlight.

Parma snapped up the 6'3" defender, and he flourished working in a back three.

Due to his Italian ancesstors in Crotone, Paletta was deemed eligible for the national side - but only made his debut in March this year.

Despite the 28-year-old's international inexperience, Cesare Prandelli had seen enough to warrant Paletta with a spot in his World Cup squad, and an opportunity to help the four-time champions conquer once again.

Can he stop Daniel Sturridge, Steven Gerrard and Co?

Will he make it? Paletta is hoping to make the 23-man final squad so he can take on England in Manaus
