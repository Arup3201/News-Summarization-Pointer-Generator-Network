She's famous for her impeccable sense of style and Spain's Queen Letizia didn't disappoint as she joined forces with King Felipe for an audience at the Zarzuela Palace.

The royal couple were hosting a discussion on the regularisation of Spanish train timetables as well as meeting charity bosses at the palace.

But while the subject matter might have been dull, Letizia's ensemble certainly wasn't with her businesslike black trousers given a pop of cheerful colour with the help of a pretty cerise top.

Chic: She added a pop of colour to her otherwise sensible ensemble and chose her favourite purple

The colour is one of the 42-year-old's favourites and she is often seen sporting it - or variations on it - at official events.

One that she didn't wear purple for was Monday's Epiphany Day celebrations, which see parades take place up and down the country. 

Known in Spain as El Día de los Reyes (Day of the Kings), it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades, the oldest of which takes place in Valencia.

The biggest and most important, however, is Madrid's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession.

Felipe was making his first appearance at an Epiphany Day parade since becoming king in June 2014 and follows a turbulent Christmas period for the Spanish royals.

On the 20th December, it was announced that Felipe's older sister Infanta Cristina, 49, would go on trial for tax crimes.  

Important: The audience at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid included a discussion on train timetables

Pleased: The assembled dignitaries looked delighted to be included in a photo with the royal couple

New rules: King Felipe hopes to regain the respect of the Spanish people following a series of scandals

Glamorous: Letizia began the new year in style and wore a floor-length teal dress for the occasion

Along with her husband, former handball player, Iñaki Urdangarín, the 49-year-old princess is one of 17 people charged with misusing funds donated to Mr Urdangardin's charity, the Noos Foundation.

As a result, Cristina has been asked to keep a low profile, has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at Felipe's coronation.

If convicted, which would be a first for Spain's royal family, she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine. 

While Felipe and Letizia remain popular, the incident has led to the introduction of new rules designed to prevent a repeat of both the current scandal and the last two to affect his family - King Juan-Carlos' love of a freebie and the infamous 2009 photo in which he was pictured standing over an elephant he had shot.

The rules, which also apply to Letizia and his two daughters, came into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'.

Along with banning freebies, royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.'
