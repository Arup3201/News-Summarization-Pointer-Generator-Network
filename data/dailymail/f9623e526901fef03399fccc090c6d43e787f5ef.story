Phil Taylor blamed missed doubles for his 7-6 defeat against Gary Anderson in the World Darts Championship final on Sunday night.

The Power was denied a 17th crown by the Flying Scotsman at the Alexandra Palace, where Anderson got rid of his reputation as the greatest darts player to never become world champion.

The statistics showed Taylor missed an incredible 55 darts at doubles, and the 54-year-old feels it was that which cost him the title and the £250,000 prize.

At one point Taylor had three darts to make it 5-3 and put daylight between him and Anderson. The 16-time champion took aim for double 12 but they all missed, allowing Anderson to make it 4-4.

He went one away from a nine darter, too, but again his love affair with double 12 continued and it wasn't to be.

Taylor reckons it is the clinical finishing of Anderson that his game was lacking in the end.

'If I didn't miss my doubles I would have won. Gary was the better player because he took his finishes,' said Taylor.

'My double 16 and double eight were awful, and Gary didn't miss. When I went to 6-6 I thought: "I have got you now."

'I wanted it to go to 5-5 (and sudden death) because I have been there three or four times and he hasn't.

'But he did a job on me in the last set. He beat me up.'

Anderson, too, set aside praise for his opponent.

Anderson said: 'Phil is the best and always will be. In a hundred years, it will still be all about Phil and that makes this even more special.

'I can't wait for Phil to retire and do us all a favour. There have been a lot of great dart players over the last 30 years and Phil has ruined them.'
