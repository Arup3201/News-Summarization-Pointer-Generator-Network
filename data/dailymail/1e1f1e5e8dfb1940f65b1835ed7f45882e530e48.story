When mother-of-three Charlotte Pittuck crossed the finish line of the 2012 London Marathon her real challenge was only just beginning.

Little more than a year later after completing the 26.2mile course, the 31-year-old would undergo a preventative double mastectomy - spending eight hours in surgery in order to drastically cut her chances of getting breast cancer.

Mrs Pittuck was just 26, and a new mother to her eldest son Harry, when she discovered she carried the Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene - a genetic mutation that meant she had an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 40 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer.

Now, just nine-months after the potentially life-saving operation, Mrs Pittuck is preparing to take on the marathon for a second time - despite fearing that she would never run again after the drastic surgery, having struggled to walk or even sit in a chair.

Mrs Pittuck, from Essex, was 10 weeks pregnant with Harry when she learned that the BRCA2 gene was present in her family.

As an expectant mother, she was forced to wait to be tested until after the birth of her first child while one by one her loved ones underwent the test, each one coming back positive.

'It was heartbreaking,' she said.

'Next up was me and I just wanted to know one way or the other I already knew that if I had the gene I would opt for a double mastectomy, luckily I had time on my hands.'

Her aunt, uncle, father, sister and brother all carried the gene, and Harry, now four, and her twins Samuel and Edith, three, each have a 50 per cent chance of being BRCA2 positive.

Having given birth to her twins in January 2011, Mrs Pittuck began her marathon training as a means to get fit before the operation.

In July last year surgeons carried out the operation, while tissue and fat were taken from the top of both her legs and used to 'build' her new breasts.

Her journey to recovery did not go smoothly. Mrs Pittuck suffered some serious complications and within just six weeks had gone under the knife three times.

Complication: Mrs Pittuck was rushed  back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size

She was rushed back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size and needed the fluid flushed out, leaving her a further eight weeks from being able to do any exercise.

She now has a 12inch scar on each leg, while her original bruising from the surgery ran from her shoulders to her knees.

But following the surgery her chances of developing breast cancer were slashed to just six per cent, and she is now embarking on her second marathon.

She is determined to show other women that even following such major surgery anything is possible.

'Following my double mastectomy I felt like I would never run again,' she said.

'I
 struggled to sit in a chair and even to walk. Running a marathon seemed
 impossible then but, as I embark on my training again I want to show 
the world anything is possible.'

She added: 'Running doesn't come naturally to me, 
far from it.

'The thought of a long run makes me want to cry and the 
thought of doing the marathon again and the training it entails fills me
 with fear but I feel like it would be the ultimate comeback and will 
hopefully show other women with breast cancer or having preventative 
surgery that pain is temporary and your body will get stronger.'

Mrs Pittuck is running the gruelling 26.2 miles to raise funds for breast cancer research charity Breast Cancer Campaign, for whom she has written a blog documenting her BRCA2 journey - from finding out she carried the gene, to the recovery from her operation as well as her marathon training.

'This is my second London Marathon, but that doesn’t make it any easier,' she said.

Support: Mrs Pittuck with her husband Paul, and with her mother Sonia Clark

'For me, it’s all about raising money, raising awareness and just generally "campaigning" against breast cancer.

'I have met so many amazing women (and men) since I found I had a mutation of the BRCA2 gene and they inspire me to be better and to be grateful.

'The marathon is my way of giving back to them and giving back to the charity and to show to myself how strong I can be.

'It feels tougher than before and it feels harder than I expected it to but that makes me all the more determined.

Worry: Mrs Pittuck's children each have a 50 per cent chance of carrying the BRCA2 gene. Mrs Pittuck found out she had the gene after she gave birth to Harry, now four

'All I ask for is no snow or rain between now and April.'

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and accounts for nearly one in three of all cancers in women.

In the UK, around 50,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year - around 138 a day.

There has been an increasing awareness of faulty BRCA genes in the last few years, particularly since actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy after discovering that she carried the BRCA1 gene.

This spring EastEnders viewers will watch as popular character Carol Jackson, played by Lindsey Coulson, discovers that she has the BRCA2 gene, which will have implication for daughters Bianca and Sonia.

Ground-breaking: Carol's upcoming storyline, which started earlier this month as the Jackson matriarch decided to be tested for the gene, is the first time a soap opera has focused on BRCA

Carol's upcoming storyline, which started earlier this month as the Jackson matriarch decided to be tested for the gene, is the first time a UK soap opera has focused on BRCA.

Through running the Marathon, Mrs Pittuck hopes to raise £2,000 for Breast Cancer Campaign - which will help fund research into the disease, and the BRCA genes.

'Without research into the BRCA2 gene, I wouldn’t have been able to make the decisions I have been able to make,' she said.

'That is why I have chosen to run the Virgin Money London Marathon once again for Breast Cancer Campaign, so I can raise more money to help the charity continue to fund vital research into breast cancer.'
