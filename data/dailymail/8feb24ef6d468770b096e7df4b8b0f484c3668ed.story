A woman who caused the deaths of a 16-year-old girl and her father after stopping on a highway to help ducklings cross the road has been jailed for 90 days.

Emma Czornobaj, 25, had pulled her car over into the left-hand lane of a provincial highway in Candiac, south of Montreal, in 2010 to rescue the animals.

Moments later a motorcycle slammed into the back of the parked vehicle. 

André Roy, 50, who was driving and his 16-year-old daughter, Jessie, who was riding on the back, were killed in the process. 

In court the animal lover said she had not seen the ducks' mother anywhere and planned to pick them up and take them home. 

Czornobaj was found guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing death, a charge and two counts of dangerous driving causing death.

The Crown had reportedly sought a sentence of nine months in jail and 240 hours of community service. 

As she was jailed during a hearing on Thursday, a judge also banned Czornobaj from the road for 10 years and told her she must perform 250 hours of community service.

According to CBC Pauline Volikakis, the wife and mother of the two victims, had said she wanted Czornobaj to get a sentence that reflects the seriousness of her actions.

After the hearing she said the sentence was enough for her to try and move on with her life.  

She was riding on her own motorbike behind her husband daughter when she say the horrific events unfold. 

Czornobaj had three years driving experience at the time of the accident and had no criminal record. 

A  police officer testified at the trial that Roy, whose speed was estimated to be from 113 km/h to 129 km/h when he applied his brakes, collided with the car at between 105 km/h and 121 km/h.

The jury was told the speed was higher than the prescribed 90 km/h limit on the road.

During the trial, witness Martine Tessier testified that she noticed parked car didn't have its hazards on and that the driver's door was open.

She also said she saw Czornobaj motioning to some ducks on the side of the road.

'I shouted to my [three] children: ‘What is she doing there? She’s going to get killed',' Tessier said, according to National Post.

'I saw a body go over the car. It looked like a rag doll. I shouted to my daughter to call 911.'

Prosecutor Annie-Claude Chasse had a message for motorists.

'What we hope is that a clear message is sent to society that we do not stop on the highway for animals. It's not worth it,' she said.

Czornobaj left the courthouse without commenting.

According to National Post, she is a financial analyst who graduated from Concordia’s John Molson School of Business where she made the dean’s list.
