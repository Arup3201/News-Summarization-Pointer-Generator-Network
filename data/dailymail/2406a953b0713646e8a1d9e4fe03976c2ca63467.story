A knife-wielding man hijacked a bus in rural Norway and killed the driver and two passengers before 
he was detained by authorities, officials have said.

Police
 in Sogn and Fjordane county in western Norway gave few details about 
the suspect, but said he had lived close to the scene of the attack, and
 was originally from South Sudan.

Police attorney Trine Erdal said the suspect was in his early 30s, not in his 50s as police had earlier reported.

Police said that the motive for the stabbing rampage was not clear.

The
 victims were two men in their 50s, the Norwegian bus driver and a 
Swedish passenger, and a 19-year-old Norwegian woman, the attorney 
said.

All had been 
stabbed. There were no other passengers on the bus, which was believed 
to have been travelling on a remote rural road near the town of Ardal, 
around 135 miles from Oslo.

The
 suspect was initially apprehended by rescuers from the fire department 
who were the first to arrive at what they thought was the scene of an accident at around 5.30pm local time.

He was 
later arrested by police and taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts, 
but was not seriously injured, Norwegian news agency NTB reported.

Oslo
 police said they called off the deployment of an anti-terror unit after
 receiving reports that the suspect had been arrested. 

The same bus route was attacked in 2003 when an Ethiopian man stabbed a bus driver to death, NTB said.

He had earlier that day killed a Congolese asylum seeker at a refugee center. 

Multiple
 killings are rare in Norway, although the country was shocked by its 
worst peacetime massacre two years ago when Anders Behring Breivik, a 
Norwegian right-wing extremist, killed 77 people in a bomb and gun 
rampage.
