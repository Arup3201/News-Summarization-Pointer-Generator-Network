Considering Russell Slade is on the verge of making history at Leyton Orient, he is in a remarkably jovial and relaxed mood.

Slade’s side face Rotherham in the League One play-off final on Sunday, when he will attempt to lead the club into the second tier of English football for the first time in 32 years.

His four years and 49 days spent in charge of the little east London club have seen barely any money spent on transfers and make him the fourth-longest serving manager in the Football League.

Keeping calm: Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade could help his side reach the Championship if they can beat Rotherham at Wembley in the play-off final

‘Stop making me feel old!’ Slade jokes when this is put to him.

‘Am I proud? Yeah I’m proud that I’ve been at this football club for four years, I’m proud that I’ve been able to manage it for four years the way I wanted to do it.

‘We’ve missed out on the play-offs twice, we’ve finished seventh twice.

‘Now we hope this is our moment to get out of League One and give this club a little bit of a shot in the arm and have some fun in the Championship.’

There is something about Slade which is infectious.

Even when the pressure is on and he is 
just moments away from the biggest match of his life, in front of more 
than 50,000 fans at Wembley, he keeps breaking out into a huge, genuine 
smile.

We’re looking out over Orient’s small Brisbane Road stadium, with room for only 9,271 fans but that number added to by the blocks of new-build flats which punctuate the four corners and overlook the smaller stands.

It’s put to Slade that getting the club into the Championship will boost this tiny East End community and those flats will soar in value.

He breaks out into an enormous chuckle when he says: ‘I’ve got one of them, why do you think I’m working so hard?’

It is another joke, he actually rents one from his chairman Barry Hearn. ‘I’m doing him another favour,’ he adds, still laughing. ‘I think it’s great for the community, I really do.

‘There was a pop-up pub during the 2012 Olympics, it’s called the Leyton Technical Pub now, it’s come to life a little bit in the years I’ve been here.

‘The Olympics was great for it and if the football club get into the Championship that’ll be great for it and the rest of the community too.’

Perhaps Slade’s down-to-Earth persona, his appreciation of how his work really impacts on others, comes from his unorthodox route in to football.

As a player he was a defender, not tall enough at 16 but when he shot up at 18 he had the chance to play for Notts County.

Slade, 53, instead choose to go to Edge Hill University to study a four-year degree in physical education.

When he finished there he went to Nottingham where he got his first job at Frank Wheldon school, but six months in he was already taking time off to coach and play reserve matches for Notts County.

‘I took the under 15s for six months, then I was taking the under 16s, and that second year I was still teaching I was playing in the reserves,’ he explains.
