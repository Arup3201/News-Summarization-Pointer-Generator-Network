She may have been sunning herself in Hawaii in recent weeks but it was business as usual for Abbey Clancy today as she unveiled her latest range for Matalan.

The model and Strictly Come Dancing winner has today revealed her new designs for the high street store - and models them all herself, of course.

Proving that she is more than just a pretty face, the mother-of-one, whose last range for the store was a success, designed the range from scratch based on her personal style.

First look: Abbey Clancy, the model and Strictly Come Dancing winner, has today unveiled her new designs for Matalan in all their black and white glory

The new transitional collection comprises 23 party pieces including dresses and co-ords all in a black and whte colour palette creating what she hopes to be one of her most flattering collections to date.

The range, which combines fun minis with mesh inserts and contrasting details, structured statement skirt co-ords and figure hugging long-sleeved midis, claims to reflect Abbey’s classic feminine style.

Reflecting her style: The mother-of-one, who is married to footballer Peter Crouch, designed the range from scratch based on her personal style

What she wears: The new transitional collection comprises of 23 party pieces including dresses and co-ords all in a monochrome colour palette that Abbey loves to wear herself

All white: The range combines fun minis with mesh inserts and contrasting details and lots of structured statement skirts designed to flatter the female figure

Speaking about her new range, she said: 'I am so excited about my new collection. They are statement, standout pieces bound to get anyone noticed. I love the peek-a-boo trend at the moment, I think showing a subtle amount of skin is really flattering, which is why I wanted to incorporate this into my current collection. 

'Black and white are always key colours in my wardrobe, and I think they work perfectly for day or night - particularly the white stripy co-ord set, that is one of my favourite pieces.'

Flasher: Abbey says her new range is full of statement, standout pieces bound to get anyone noticed and she's included lots of cut-outs because she thinks showing a subtle amount of skin is really flattering

The ‘Abbey by Abbey Clancy’ collection will be available online from August 29 and in selected stores nationwide from the 3rd September.

Strictly winner Abbey has seen her working life go from strength-to-strength in recent months.

Abbey previously said: ‘I haven't really had a plan with my career, I've just done whatever's come my way and enjoyed it.'

It's a blackout! Abbey has only designed cothes in black and white because, she says, they are always key colours in her wardrobe, and she believes they work perfectly for day or night

Hard worker: Abbey's last range for Matalan sold exceptionally well and no doubt she will be preparing for fashion month, where she'll hold up the front row 

It's a sell out! Abbey's last range for the high street store did so well that the star is back for round two
