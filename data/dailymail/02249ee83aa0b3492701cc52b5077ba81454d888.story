A nine-year-old cagefighter has appealed for the chance to carry on taking part in the contests claiming he enjoys the cheering crowds and insists 'it's good fun.'

Kian Makinson was filmed taking part in a fight with an eight-year-old boy whose father has requested he remain anonymous, kicking, shoving and grappling in front of baying adults at a social club in Preston.

His opponent, who has not been named, was left in tears, and the video footage has sparked outrage among child and medical experts, who called for a police and social services investigation.

However, Kian hit back last night, telling the Daily Star: 'I like the atmosphere when fighting. It's exciting. The crowd cheering is really loud.

'It is good fun. I enjoy it and I am quite good at it. I am more confident when I'm wrestling.'

Meanwhile, his father Nick Hartley, 33, a breakdown recovery driver, claimed the discipline of the sport helped his son, who used to be naughty, learn respect.

He said there was no 
harm in the sport adding: 'If he wasn't cage fighting he would probably
be chucking stones at buses and giving people grief.'

Last night, legal experts warned parents who encourage their young children to take part in cage fighting contests could be jailed for child cruelty.

They face sentences of up to six months 
for allowing a boy or girl of primary school age to take part in the 
sport – described as  ‘barbaric’ by the Culture Secretary.

Officials also said the Greenlands New Labour Club in 
Preston, Lancashire, is to be investigated over whether it broke its 
licence conditions.

Upsetting: The young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight, and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a Preston working club

A source at the Crown Prosecution 
Service said: ‘A young child being forced to take part in any violent 
sport could constitute child cruelty.

As such, a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12-week sentence or a maximum 26-week sentence.’

Social
services bosses in Lancashire confirmed they had launched an inquiry 
into the cage fighting, which is also known as mixed martial arts, to 
‘consider any child safety concerns’.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘barbaric’.

‘Getting more young people doing sport is great but I do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage,’ he said.

‘It feels very barbaric and I know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that.’

He added he was ‘shocked and surprised’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments.

His comments came after the British Medical Association, the NSPCC and 
Safechild branded child cage fighting ‘disturbing and sick’. A British 
Association of Martial Arts spokesman insisted: ‘Children this young 
shouldn’t be involved in cage fighting.’

Lancashire Police officers have decided to take no further action either on a child safety level or licensing of the premises.

Professional appearance: Just like in an adult event, the tiny fighters have an entourage.

Grappling: The pair begin their fight slowly, testing out the space between them as they start their bout

It emerged last night, however, that council chiefs have ordered a 
licence review for the Greenlands Labour Club and will ask the venue not
to put on any similar events involving juveniles.

JAMES SLACK: 'This was about giving grown-ups, swigging lager, an evening of blood-thirsty excitement, to match that of adult cage fighting. In Britain, we have long had laws which ban dog fighting. Rightly, it is believed that inciting animals to hurt each other for the entertainment of their human masters is barbaric. Which rather begs the question: in what sort of country do the police pursue with the full force of the law those who encourage dogs to fight one another, but turn a blind eye when adults do the same with children?'

The deputy leader of Preston City Council, John Swindells, said: ‘I am 
appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking 
place in Preston.

‘Having checked the club’s licence there is a condition that children 
should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and I think it 
needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached.

‘As such, I have now made a request for the licence at Greenlands Labour Club to be reviewed. A formal licensing review process will now follow.’

That could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter.

A similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say.

The shocking video that emerged on Wednesday shows Kian and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear.

One of them is shown apparently receiving medical attention for a leg injury and bursting into tears.

The event was held almost a fortnight 
ago with about 250 adults paying £25 a ticket to watch 14 fights. The 
other clashes involved semi-professional adults.

Sources said the night was a boisterous alcohol-fuelled affair.

Sharefight, the company commissioned to 
film the event, said the video had been removed from the internet ‘out 
of respect’ for parents and others who had shown concern.

Fight: Before long, they have hit the canvas and take turns in pinning each other down

Young fighters: The children wear no padding or headguards for the ten minute bout in Preston

The event took place in a ‘safe environment’, a spokesman added.

Greenlands Labour Club has also defended its decision to hold the event.

Time out: Scantily clad ring girls parade on the canvas in between rounds

Victory: The fight ends to cheers from the adoring crowd
