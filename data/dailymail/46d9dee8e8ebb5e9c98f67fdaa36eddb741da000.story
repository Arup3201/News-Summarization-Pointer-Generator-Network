A man who calls himself 'Mule' has been riding through towns and cities in the U.S. for nearly 30 years with three real mules carrying his rather more high-tech possessions.

The 65-year-old man describes himself - on his Facebook page - with the words: 'We are mules. We are from the outside. We live outside all day, every day.'

He has been spotted by people in locations including outside the Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley and walking across the Golden Gate Bridge with his three-animal pack and saddlebags - which admittedly contain three mobiles, two voice recorders, a digital camera and a Samsung tablet computer which he uses to update his website.

Master: 'Mule' - he has no other name - has ridden across American with his three-mule team

Mule, whose real name is John Sears, grew up in suburbia, just South of San Francisco, near Los Altos, according to The Atlantic,

A nomad by choice, he apparently bought his first mule 10 years ago in Spokane, Washington, so he could carry more supplies with him into the bush and visit towns less often.

Mule says he works menial jobs in the winter months in order to buy what he needs.

He travels during the summer, walking by day and sleeping in public spaces or on grass beside the road at night.

While no details are known about why 
Mule started his wandering, in recent years he has become a campaigner 
against urban development in California which, he warns, is gradually being subsumed into a 'megatropolis'.

'The space is continually shrinking,' he told the Press Democrat. 'We have to bring the man-made world into balance.'

Team: Two of the Mules that have walked across the cities and countryside of the U.S.

Back and forth: Mule has been walking across the American West for the past 29 years

Diary: Mule carries three mobiles, two voice recorders, a camera and a computer to document his travels on Facebook and his website

According to his website, his nomadic lifestyle made him notice 'an ever increasing urban sprawl' and that 'as the urban environment exploded, natural habitats have vanished'.

He claims to have made the decision to start speaking out two years ago on the 295 mile walk from Las Vegas to Ely, Nevada.

He charges his computer in Starbucks and uses it to document his travels and update his website and Facebook page.

He explained: 'I needed a website so that when I got to California, I would have a voice.

'I'm nothing. I'm uneducated, I'm a weak little man, I'm the low man on the totem pole and I've been there my whole life. But a website would be my voice.'

Defiant: Mule has frequent run-ins with the police for offences such as sleeping rough

Wanderer: Mule rides between cities such as San Diego, left, to more equine-friendly communities

Ride-thru: The Mules' owner first turned to the animals to help him carry supplies on his nomadic wanderings - here shown outside a burger joint in Corona, California and in the town of Westwood, Massachusetts

Broadwalk: The Mules take a trip down the road in the city of Moonpark, California

Old ways: The Mules take a trip past the San Mateo County History Museum

He also has a lawyer, Sharon Sherman, to help him deal with his frequent run-ins with the police. She has taken on the work free of charge because she is fascinated by the legal questions Mule raises.

She said: 'I've been in practice for 35 years, but Mule really made me stop and think about issues that I've never considered before.

'We have a countervailing balance between public space, private space, and what access do we really have to public space.

'Sure, I can walk down a street, but which street? What's the difference in using a road in a car, than with mules? Why do you have more rights in a car, than if you are walking, and walking with animals?'

Outsider: Mule has a lawyer who represents him free of charge, and he has been jailed in the past and sent to a mental facility

Traffic: The Mules make the most of a multi-use bikeway in an industrial area

Mule is currently fighting a $485 charge
 for sleeping in the entrance to Torrey Pines State Reserve and a court 
date was originally set for August 2013, but had to be pushed back until
 2014 because Mule travels with the sun and seasons.

In another episode he was arrested at
 the side of the 101 highway last month, jailed, and then sent to a 
metal facility before eventually being released.

He
 is also being followed by an American film maker John McDonald who is 
making a documentary about him and helping him with his gadgets.

Like
 many who cross his path, McDonald has been charmed by Mule and his 
simple way of life and has become a supporter of his campaign.

Controversial: The court date that had been set for Mule's $485 charge for sleeping rough had to be pushed back as he travels with the seasons

Nature: The 65-year-old sleeps on the grass by the side of the road or in public spaces
