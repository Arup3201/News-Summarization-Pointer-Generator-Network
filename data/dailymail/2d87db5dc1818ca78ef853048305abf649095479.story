Nasa has returned some of the most stunning true-colour images of Saturn, showing the planet suspended in eternal beauty alongside its largest moon.

The crystal-clear images were produced by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which has been circling Saturn for the last eight years.

Titan is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the solar system and, even if it is 'just' a moon, it is bigger than the planet Mercury.

The images also capture the changing hues of Saturn's northern and southern hemispheres as they pass from one season to the next.

In many respects, Saturn's largest 
moon, Titan, is one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date.

With
 its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a 
frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began 
pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

Amazing images: Titan, Saturn's largest moon, measures 3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers, across and is larger than the planet Mercury

Artist's concept: What Titan might look like from the surface - a rocky world with liquid lakes

Titan is of great interest to
 scientists because it has a substantial, active atmosphere and complex,
 Earth-like processes that shape its surface.

The moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini's arrival.

Since 2004, the spacecraft's observations have taken the study of this unique world into a whole new dimension.

Cassini has revealed that Titan's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the main component of natural gas), which forms clouds and occasionally rains from the sky as water does on Earth.

Winds sculpt vast regions of dark, hydrocarbon-rich dunes that girdle the moon's equator and low latitudes.

Volcanism may occur as well, but with liquid water as the lava.

On its journey to Saturn, Cassini 
carried the European-built Huygens probe. On Jan. 14, 2005, Huygens 
achieved humankind's first landing on a body in the Outer Solar System 
when it parachuted through Titan's murky skies.

Huygens took measurements of 
atmospheric composition and wind speeds during its decent, along with an
 incredible series of images showing telltale patterns of erosion by 
flowing liquid.

The probe came to rest on what appeared to be a 
floodplain, surrounded by rounded cobbles of water ice.

As the Cassini Mission progresses, the
 spacecraft will monitor Titan's atmosphere and surface for signs of 
seasonal change.

The spacecraft's radar and camera systems will continue
 to peer through the haze, expanding our high resolution maps of the 
surface.

And scientists will eagerly await new data that could confirm 
the presence of a liquid ocean beneath the giant moon's surface.

The exploration of this amazing place 
is just beginning. Frigid and alien, yet also remarkably similar to our 
own planet, Titan is a new world – revealed before our very eyes by the 
Cassini and Huygens spacecraft.

Some of these views, such as those of the polar vortex, are only 
possible because Cassini's newly inclined - or tilted - orbits allow 
more direct viewing of the polar regions of Saturn and its moons.

Upon Cassini's arrival at Saturn eight years ago, Saturn's northern winter hemisphere was an azure blue.

Now
 that winter is encroaching on the planet's southern hemisphere and 
summer on the north, the color scheme is reversing: blue is tinting the 
southern atmosphere and is fading from the north.

Other images depict the newly discovered south polar vortex in the atmosphere of Titan, reported recently by Cassini scientists.

Saturn in all its glory: This image, taken in October 2004, shows the full scale of the planet, including its shadow stretching across the rings

Cassini's
 visible-light cameras have seen a concentration of yellowish haze in 
the detached haze layer at the south pole of Titan since March 
27.

Cassini's visual and 
infrared mapping spectrometer spotted the massing of clouds around the 
south pole as early as May 22 in infrared wavelengths.

After
 a June 27 flyby of the moon, Cassini released a dramatic image and 
movie showing the vortex rotating faster than the moon's rotation 
period. The four images being released today were acquired in May, June 
and July of 2012.

Scientists
 are looking forward to seeing more of the same - new phenomena like 
Titan's south polar vortex and changes wrought by the passage of time 
and seasons - during the remainder of Cassini's mission.

Carolyn
 Porco, imaging team lead based at the Space Science Institute in 
Boulder, Colo, said: 'Cassini has been in orbit now for the last eight 
years, and despite the fact that we can't know exactly what the next 
five years will show us, we can be certain that whatever it is will be 
wondrous.'

Amanda Hendrix, 
deputy project scientist, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, California, said: 'It is so fantastic to experience, through 
the instruments of Cassini, seasonal changes in the Saturn system.

'Some
 of the changes we see in the data are completely unexpected, while some
 occur like clockwork on a seasonal timescale. It's an exciting time to 
be at Saturn.'

Saturn's rings obscure part of Titan's colorful visage in this image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft

Saturn's rings obscure part of the moon Titan's colorful visage in this image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft..

If you look at the south pole, you can see a vortex - a mass of swirling gas around the pole in the atmosphere - that first appeared in Titan's atmosphere in 2012.

The
 northern part of the moon's atmosphere visible here includes the north 
polar hood, a cap of haze looking slightly darker than the rest of the 
atmosphere and seen near the top of the moon.

Parts of the rings appear dark near
 the center of this view because of the shadow cast by the planet.

However, a sliver of illuminated Titan can be seen through the Cassini 
Division in the rings near the middle of this darkness.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ring plane.

Images
 taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view.

The images were obtained with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 16, 2012, at a distance of
 approximately 1.9 million miles (3 million kilometers) from Titan. 
Image scale is 11 miles (18 kilometers) per pixel on Titan.

In many respects, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date.

With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

The moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini's arrival.

Here, Cassini spacecraft looks toward the 
night side of Titan and sees sunlight scattering through
 the periphery of the moon's atmosphere and forming a ring of color.

Titan's
 north polar hood can be seen at the top of this view, and a hint of the
 south polar vortex can be detected at the bottom.

This view looks toward the 
Saturn-facing side of Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across). 
North on Titan is up and rotated 9 degrees to the right.

The images were acquired with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 6, 2012, at a distance of 
approximately 134,000 miles (216,000 kilometers) from Titan. Image scale
 is 8 miles (13 kilometers) per pixel.

Again, images were filtered to produce a natural colour look.

Saturn has countless moons - at least 24, with dozens if not a couple of hundred smaller bodies in orbit. Seven of the moons are substantial, and in this image three of them can be spotted
