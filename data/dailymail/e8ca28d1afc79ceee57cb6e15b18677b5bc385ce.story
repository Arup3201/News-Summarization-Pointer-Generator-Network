One month after his owner died and willed him to be killed and buried with her, Bela the German shepherd had a new home where he can live out the rest of his life in peace.  

Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah this weekend after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio.

Bela was rescued after animal lovers rallied to his defense and got a stay of execution for him early this month.

Saved: Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Society in Utah this weekend after making the 1,700-mile cross-country journey from southern Indiana

Bela will be allowed to live out the rest of his life at the shelter, where he will be given special care and attention by the Best Friends handlers

Best Friends says Bela has a history of 'intermittent aggression,' but that he is otherwise a sweet, friendly dog 

When his owner, Connie Lay, died on November 25, she said that he should be either sent to the Best Friends shelter or put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers. 

Ms Lay's attorney, Doug Denmure, said Ms Lay didn't have enough money to send her pet to Utah - so the only option was to euthanize him. 

News of Bela's fate was widely reported and sparked a #saveBela campaign on social media. Following outrage from the community, Best Friends stepped in and said the shelter would take Bela and have him transported to Utah. 

Mr Denmure now claims it was never his intention to have the dog put down. 

'It was this lack of information and the unfounded social media backlash about Connie Ley, myself, and the provisions in her will about her pets, that caused the delay in resolving Bela’s future,' he said, according to a blog post from Best Friends. 

Bela was scheduled to be euthanized early this month but got a stay of execution following an outcry from animal lovers

Under Indiana law, Bela is considered property and his fate was entirely up to his owner Connie Lay

Bela was picked up by Best Friends and driven 1,700 miles to Utah after Christmas

However, Mr  Denmure never contacted Best Friends and the shelter learned about Bela's fate from media reports. 

Mr Denmure had previously told WCPO-TV that Bela was Ms Lay's property and was hers to 'dispose of' as she wished. 

'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' he said. 

'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.' 

Best Friends say Bela has a history of 'intermittent aggressiveness' and will need some special care. 

'Bela’s situation is a poignant reminder that our animals are our family, and families need to plan for their pets who survive them,' the shelter's co-founder Francis Battista said.
