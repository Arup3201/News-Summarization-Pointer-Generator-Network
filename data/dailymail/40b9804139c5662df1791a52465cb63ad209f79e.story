A woman who believed her cat had drowned in a flash food outside her home in Victoria's southwest four-and-a-half-years-ago was reunited with her pet this week by a woman who claimed she could no longer afford to feed him.

The woman finally contacted the local council to track down the cat's real owner, Dhenai Veale, through his micro-chip - three years after she originally found Barnie and decided to keep him.

Ms Veale first lost her 'beautiful' Barnie after he disappeared while playing in a gutter with her other cat in October 2009. She spent months desperately driving around her neighbourhood every night, calling out his name, in the hope of finding him.

The 30-year-old mother 'put up flyers everywhere' and 'always had that horrible feeling that he had drowned' since Barnie vanished.

'I had two cats and they were both playing in the gutter. They used to play there every morning,' she told MailOnline.

'It was on one of those days that there was a flash flood. I never saw him come out of the drain,' she recalled on Friday after being reunited with her missing pet.

Ms Veale who lives in Bellbrae, on the Great Ocean Road, in Victoria southwest, only just discovered her cat has been living at a woman's home in Heidelberg - over an hour's drive away in Melbourne's northeast  - for the last three years.

'I'm not sure how far he travelled down the drain ... and I'm not sure where they found him. But they live about an hour away and said they found him three years ago,' Ms Veale explained.

Amazed: 'I'm just happy to have him back,' Ms Veale, pictured here with her son Dyllon, told MailOnline. Three-year-old Dyllon wasn't even born when Barnie went missing in 2009

Barnie's whereabouts remains unaccounted for from the time he went missing to the time the woman, who is in her fifties, and her daughter decided to claim him as their own pet.

'There is an 18 month time gap between when I lost him and they found him,' Ms Veale said.

Ms Veale was reunited with the black and white cat after receiving a phone call from the council ranger in Heidelberg once the woman finally decided to see if the cat had a real owner.

'I was quite shocked. It was quite strange getting the voicemail to say he's been living with a family,' she said

'They just decided they were going to get him scanned to see if he had an owner.

'I went and got him a few nights ago. She was a lovely lady, she said she had six cats and her partner had passed away and she just couldn't afford to keep them anymore so she rang the council,' a forgiving Ms Veale explained.

Besotted: Barnie, seen here being checked over by the vet upon his return, is already loved by Ms Veale's son Dyllon

Check up: The vet told Ms Veale Barnie is facing dental surgery as his teeth are now in a bad condition

'I went and got my beautiful cat and was thrilled. It's amazing,' she added.

Asked what she said to the woman who took her cat, Ms Veale remarked on all of the woman's six cats.

'I just said "oh wow that's a lot of cats" and she just said "yeah I couldn't feed them all".'

Ms Veale did not leave the woman empty handed, in return for giving Barnie back she gave the woman a bottle of champagne.

'I was there for about 15 minutes. I didn't want to just grab him and take him out of that enivornment. I gave her a bottle of champagne and took Barnie away with me,' she said.

Ms Veale has now reunited Barnie with her other cat and her three-year-old son Dyllon who wasn't even born when Barnie went missing.

Friends: Ms Veale's two cats, seen here one month before Barnie went missing, used to play together in the gutter outside her home every day

'Today is the first day that they've been together. I wanted to wait until I'd taken Barnie to the vet and make sure he was OK. I also have a three-year-old son now so I wanted to make sure he was healthy.'

And the former family member has slotted right back into Ms Veale's home as she explained 'my son absolutely loves him'.

As for Barnie's health, the vet has told Ms Veale her cat is 'quite overweight' after his four-and-a-half-years away.

'We will have to put him on a strict diet and his dental is not that great. He needs surgery to clear up his mouth,' she said.

Ms Veale won't be taking any action against the woman who took her cat as she believes there isn't 'much you can do'.

'They should have got him scanned when they first found him not now. But everyone is different. I'm just happy to have him back,' Ms Veale said.
