It seems most Aussies are a bit chicken when it comes to eating spicy foods.

A new study has found that fewer than 10 per cent of Australians enjoy extra spicy flavours, despite 46 per cent of people describing themselves as having adventurous taste buds.

The research by Portuguese restaurant Nando's, surveyed over 1000 Australians to gauge how often they eat fiery foods.

The research also explored how taste buds influence self-perception. 

According to the study, chilli lovers see themselves as smarter than those who opt for 'milder' flavours, with 60 per cent of chilli lovers describing themselves as intelligent, and only 40 per cent of mild flavour fans doing likewise 

While 49% of those who opt for mild flavours classify themselves as confident, 60 per cent of hot heads saw themselves as self- assured.

Chilli lovers were also more likely to participate in high adrenaline activities, with 10 per cent having sky dived against the three per cent of mild eaters.

Nando's also examined data from thousands of their own customers, revealing that only 22 per cent of Australians seek out intense flavours.

Jude Leon of Nando's said that 'despite considering ourselves a nation of adventurous...most Aussies tend to stick with mild, rather than wild, options when it comes to flavours.'

So what actually happens to us when we eat fiery foods?

Accredited  Dietician Geraldine Georgeou from Designer Diets Sydney explained that 'it can feel like our tummy and mouth is burning but actually it's not.'

'In chillies there is a substance called capsaicin, which activates and releases a compound called Substance P. This substance transmits the pain and burning sensation that we feel when we eat chilli.'

Nandos, the restaurant which conducted the study, says that despite Australians considering adventurous when it comes for food, most Australians stick to 'mild' flavours

Dietician Geraldine Georgeou recommends building up your tolerance to spice by slowly introducing it into your diet

Ms Georgeou explained that the age people are introduced to chilli can affect how well they can handle it. 

'The younger your exposure the higher your tolerance as nerve endings can be desensitized, due to the regular consumption of spicy foods.'

She said that an immunity to spice can still be built up, though: 'your tolerance for spicy food can be built up by slowly introducing foods that are initially low to medium and finally to hot. Try adding extra black pepper on your food or you can spice your tomato sauce with Tabasco.'

'Once you have acclimatised you can increase the intensity by adding seeded chopped chillies to your favourite dish to increase your tolerance to the next level.'
