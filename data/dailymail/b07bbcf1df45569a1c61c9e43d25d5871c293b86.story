David Cameron was at war with his own senior law officer last night after insisting that prisoners would not be given the vote.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve was said to be ‘furious’ with the Prime Minister’s stance.

Last night there was speculation that Mr Grieve could even resign his Government role if the Prime Minister fails to respect the ‘rule of law’ and do as he wishes.

The Prime Minister told MPs that Britain would not capitulate to demands by the European Court of Human Rights for inmates to be enfranchised.

He told MPs: ‘No one should be in any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.’

His comments were seen as a swift slap-down for Mr Grieve, the Cabinet’s most senior legal adviser.

Only minutes earlier Mr Grieve had claimed that Britain’s reputation would be damaged if it did not adhere to the ruling by Strasbourg, which dates back to 2005.

Mr Grieve, who claimed it was technically possible for Britain to be booted out of the Council of Europe, said: ‘The United Kingdom has an enviable reputation in relation to human rights standards and adherence.

‘I have no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws.’

Mr Grieve argued that refusing 
inmates the vote ‘would be costly to the United Kingdom’ as Strasbourg 
would almost certainly award them compensation worth tens of millions of
pounds.

Mr Grieve added that, while the Government could choose not to pay, that ‘would be a further breach of the obligations’.

He
added: ‘The issue is whether the United Kingdom wishes to be in breach 
of its international obligations and what that does to the reputation of
the United Kingdom.’

The remarks by Mr Grieve infuriated backbench Tory MPs.

They
insist it is nonsense to suggest  Britain could be thrown out of the 
Council of Europe, which has failed to suspend the membership of 
countries such as Russia and Turkey which are guilty of flagrant abuses 
of human rights.

MPs also 
point out that the overwhelming majority of MPs voted last year  to 
maintain the UK’s historic ban on prisoner voting and say Strasbourg 
must respect the sovereignty of Parliament.

The
latest day of drama over prisoner voting was prompted by claims that 
the Government was prepared finally to reach a settlement with 
Strasbourg.

To the anger of
Tory MPs, it was reported that Mr Grieve had persuaded Mr Cameron of 
the need to introduce a Bill giving at least a limited number of 
convicts the vote.

But the claims were immediately rejected by Number Ten and insiders at the Ministry of Justice.

Later,
at Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t
want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not have the vote.

‘If
it helps by having another vote in Parliament on another resolution to 
make absolutely clear, to help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am
very happy to do that.’

A 
Tory source said Mr Grieve had gone public with his concerns after 
becoming frustrated with Mr  Cameron’s refusal to accept his advice on 
prisoner voting.

He is backed in the Cabinet by former Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke.

Opposition: David Cameron (left) has said the vote idea makes him feel 'physically sick', while UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (right) was shocked by ministers even considering giving concessions to the court

The
source said: ‘For Dominic the rule of law is the key issue. The legal 
advice is very clear that the UK has to abide by the court’s ruling. 
There are different ways of doing it, but we cannot just say no – it may
be popular politically in the short term, but legally it is madness and
even the popularity of it may fade when we start having to pay 
compensation to murderers.’

A senior Government source insisted that Mr Cameron’s stance did not conflict with the Government’s legal advice.

The source said: ‘The Attorney General’s arguments are slightly difficult to penetrate – he says lots of different things.

‘The focus has been on his concerns, but he does point out that parliament is sovereign and that there is flexibility in this.’
