A former volunteer firefighter already charged with arson faces new allegations that he lured children with toys, money and pornography and sexually assaulted them.

Twenty-year-old John Corcoran IV of Glenolden, Pennsylvania, molested more than a dozen children over two years.

The attacks took place at his home, as well as in the showers of a YMCA locker room, and on bonfires outside a local historical site, the Lower Swedish Cabin in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, authorities said.

Corcoran (pictured center) is now charged with luring and raping 14 children aged between eight and 14 over a two-year period, including while he was out on bail for earlier arson charges

"(He) lured these vulnerable children under the guise of his friendship and then exploited them with the promise of gifts only to then sexually exploit and abuse them," Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said.

Corcoran has been in jail since August on the arson charges, in which he's accused of torching three abandoned buildings before arriving on the scene to help fight them.

The new allegations surfaced after a mother found her child in possession of pornography.

Her child said it came from Corcoran and accused him of sexual abuse.

The investigation led to 13 other children, aged eight to 14, who said they were also abused.

Prosecutors said the grooming and sexual assaults happened over the last two years, some occurred even while he was out on bail for the arson charges NBC 10 Philadelphia reports.

District Attorney Jack Whelan said one of Corcoran's victims including a girl with mental disabilities who he filmed.

Corcoran was arraigned Friday on 161 new charges, including felony rape of a child, according to the Delaware Country District Attorney's office.

It was unclear if he entered a plea.

Michael Ranck, president of the Community YMCA of Eastern Delaware County, said Corcoran was a member of the Ridley facility but did not work there.

He said his staff was cooperating in the investigation and voiced concern for the victims' well-being.

Corcoran had volunteered with Glenolden's Goodwill Fire Department. The arson case, one of 78 charges, is set for trial next month.

He could not be reached for comment on Friday, and a defense lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

Corcoran first came to the attention of authorities after a suspicious fire back in July at an address across the street from the volunteer firehouse.

Glenolden's Goodwill Fire Department where Corcoran was a vounteer when he helped a 17-year-old set fire to three vacant homes before helping put out the fires shortly afterwards

He allegedly admitted to helping a 17-year-old Tinicum Township boy set fire to the vacant home in Delmar Drive on July 20.

He also allegedly admitted to helping the teen light two other homes on fire in the Briarcliff section of Darby Township.

In his role as a volunteer firefighter, Corcoran responded to both of those fires and helped put them out.
