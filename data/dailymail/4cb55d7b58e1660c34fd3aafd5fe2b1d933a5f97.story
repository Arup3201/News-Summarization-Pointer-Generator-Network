A driver's dash cam has captured a heart-stopping moment when his vehicle slammed into a head-on collision with a truck.

The footage shows a red Mazda hatchback driving along Kingsford Smith Drive in Brisbane when a truck turned onto the Gateway Motorway at a red arrow and onto oncoming traffic.

The black ute on the right lane  can be seen stopping at the intersection in time to avoid a near-miss collision as the truck made its turn.

But it appears the driver of the red vehicle, known only as Brad, did not attempt to brake or swerve at the time.
