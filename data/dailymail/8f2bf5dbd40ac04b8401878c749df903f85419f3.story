Samuel See, 34, died of a drug overdose, a medical examiner confirmed today

A Yale University professor found dead in a prison cell overdosed on meth, the medical examiner's office said on Monday.

Samuel See, 34, suffered acute methamphetamine and amphetamine intoxication with recent myocardial infarction on November 24 last year, according to courant.com.

Mr See died at the Union Avenue detention
 facility in Connecticut just hours after he was arrested following a 
domestic dispute with his estranged husband Sunder Ganglani, 32.

Mr See's death was ruled an accident 
after he was found alone by police in his cell around 6am.

He was 
pronounced dead following attempts to revive him.

The rising academic star, who taught literature, was on leave from the Ivy League school at the time of his death.

Police are now investigating Mr See's death.

On the evening of November 23, Mr See was arrested at his home in New Haven, Connecticut after the professor's sister called the police.

According
 to detectives, Mr See's estranged husband Mr Ganglani had dropped by to pick up his belongings and stayed there for 
more than two hours in violation of an order of protection.

When Mr See asked police to remove his spouse from his residence, officers told him that Mr Ganglani also had an order of protection against
 him.

Police said Mr See then 'became enraged,' yelling that he should not be arrested because it was his house.

See allegedly put up a fight as the officers tried to handcuff him.

As
 he was being led to the police cruiser waiting outside, See allegedly screamed at one of the cops: 'I will kill you... I will destroy 
you.’

Mr Ganglani was also arrested. The Yale professor was taken to a hospital to be treated for a cut above his eye. He was taken to the Union Avenue facility about 9pm and charged with 
violating a protective order, interfering with police and threatening.

The young educator had previously had run-ins with police.

On September 18, See and Ganglani - who married last May after meeting at Yale - were 
arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace and third-degree assault, 
in what court records indicate was a domestic dispute.

The two were 
issued orders of protection by the court, ordering the couple to avoid 
close contact.

See, who obtained his PhD from
 UCLA in 2009, was an assistant professor of English and American 
studies at Yale.  His work centered around themes of sexual orientation in modern literature.

‘The University community is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Samuel See. Our condolences go out to his family, faculty colleagues, and students, and his friends at Yale and elsewhere,’ the administration of Yale said in a statement.

Shortly after his tragic death, it emerged that See's personal details were posted on various male escort websites. 

New Haven Register 
 reported that the website Ryan Cochran Escort Services included See's 
phone number which was listed on an order of protection filed against 
him in September.

A profile photo on the same site allegedly also matches See's profile photograph on a LinkedIn account.

A Facebook page with pictures resembling See and listed under the name Ryan Cochran includes See’s home address. The website contains a cache of sexually explicit pictures.
