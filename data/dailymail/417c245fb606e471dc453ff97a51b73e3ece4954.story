A snowboarder was killed in an avalanche on Thursday close to the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort.

Michael Kazanjy, 29, was swept down a steep slope by a rushing wall of snow more than 50 yards wide.

Mr Kazanjy, who is originally from California, was buried under up to 6 feet of snow shortly before 1pm. He was quickly found and given CPR by a doctor but pronounced dead at 1.30pm.

The cause of death is so far unclear although trauma or suffocation are suspected.

The 29-year-old was a lifelong skier but had ventured off the Jackson Hole resort slopes with two friends into the back country of Wyoming. He had recently moved to Jackson Hole from the Bay Area where he attended UC Berkley. 

The group had taken the train to the top of Rendezvous Mountain before opening a gate into an area which had several warning signs.

Mr Kazanjy's two friends escaped the avalanche uninjured. They are believed to have been visiting from California.

Director of the Bridger Teton Avalanche Center Bob Comey told ABC: 'It's kind of like Russian roulette when you get on this slope.

'If six 
people do it and no one dies, then 50 people do it and no one dies, 
people get kind of complacent.'

Mr Kazanjy was the first down the slope known as Pucker Face which has an angle greater that 45 degrees. He is believed to have triggered the avalanche.

The 29-year-old's family paid tribute to him today, saying: 'Mike lived life with a full heart. He loved his family, his Cal Bears, his skiing buddies and San Francisco.'

On average, 28 people are killed in avalanches each year.
