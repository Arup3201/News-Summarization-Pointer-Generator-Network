Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini have extended their contracts with Juventus, keeping them at the Serie A club through 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Buffon, who is the captain of Juventus and the Italian national team, will be 39 when his new deal expires and will have spent 16 years as the club's goalkeeper.

'As both parties wished to continue, it was the natural choice to extend my contract for another two years,' said Buffon.

Giorgio Chiellini, who joined the reigning Serie A champions in 2005, is set to stay at the Turin club until 2018

'The fact that it could be my last contract should be taken into consideration, but it doesn't worry me. I think about the present and then we'll see if the future will give me something unexpected.

'I need energy and courage to make my career last even longer. The praise from the club makes me proud of the choices I made 14 years ago.'

Juventus is sure to keep hold of Chiellini at least until the Italy defender is 33, at which time he will have been with the club for 13 years.

'Being here makes me emotional,' Chiellini said. 'It makes me think back to all the people who helped me grow and become a man in Turin.

'It makes me proud to know that, in years to come, when people talk about Gigi and Giorgio, they'll think of Juventus.'

Both players stayed with the club when it was relegated to Serie B for match-fixing and have been a key part of its resurgence, helping it to three straight Serie A titles.

The duo have won almost every honor in club football together, with Buffon also winning the World Cup in 2006, but a Champions League winners medal is still missing from their trophy collection.

'Winning the Champions League is not just a personal dream,' Buffon said. 'The best thing would be lifting it and celebrating together.

'We don't set limits on ourselves but we know it's a big target that's difficult to achieve.'
