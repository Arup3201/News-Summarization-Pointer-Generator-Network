A surfer who was injured in a suspected shark attack says he thought the creature was a dolphin before he realised he was hurt.

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales’ north coast.

Mr Reitman claims the shark was two to three metres long.

The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News.

‘I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,’ he told Seven.

‘I didn’t realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.’

The keen swimmer says he is not deterred by the suspected shark attack and is keenly awaiting his return to the water. 

The Byron Bay surfer says he is looking forward to swimming in the ocean again, despite his run in with one of the sea's deadliest creatures
