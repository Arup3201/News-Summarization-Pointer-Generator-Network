West Ham have confirmed that Joe Cole, Jack Collison and George McCartney will all leave the club when their contracts expire next month.

Former Chelsea star Cole made 25 appearances for the club during his second spell in east London after signing an 18-month contract in 2013.

The 32-year-old struggled to nail down a place of Sam Allardyce's first team and start just six matches last season.

On the way: West Ham have confirmed that Joe Cole will leave the club

Cole recently revealed in April that he would leave West Ham in search of first team football.

He told Sky Sports: 'If I could stay and play then that would be ideal but that doesn't look like I'm the manager's first choice.'

The Hammers also revealed that discussion were 'ongoing' with Jussi Jaaskelainen and Matt Taylor before wishing the departing trio the best of luck.       

The West Ham statement read: 'The Hammers can confirm that Joe Cole, George McCartney and Jack Collison will be given free transfers when their contracts expire on 30 June.

'West Ham United would like to thank Joe, George and Jack for their considerable efforts and contribution to the success of the Club in recent seasons and wish them well in their future careers.'
