Thomas Rady, 26, was arrested Wednesday on manslaughter charges after he accidentally shot and killed his friend, Donnie McLendon. Rady previously told police McClendon was killed during a game of 'Russian Roulette.'

A Florida man who told police his friend was killed during a game of 'Russian Roulette' actually shot his friend dead by mistake.

Police say that Thomas Rady, 29, accidentally shot his friend in the head Saturday night at a Tampa Bay residence.

The victim died from his injury on Wednesday.

Rady was arrested Thursday by Tampa Bay Police and charged with manslaughter.

Donnie McLendon, 26, died Wednesday at Tampa General Hospital after he was 
shot in the head Saturday night at a St. Petersburg home, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Police say that Thomas Wane Rady, 29, and David McKee, 22, originally reported they 
had been drinking and smoking pot with McLendon when an armed man busted in and blasted McLendon in a botched robbery.

The two then changed their 
story, telling police that the gun went off during McClendon's turn to pull the trigger while playing 'Russian Roulette.'

Rady
and McKee said McLendon was the third player to hold a 44-caliber 
handgun to his head loaded with one bullet, as the game's rules go 
taking a chance that the shot fired would not be the one filled.

However, an autopsy revealed inconsistencies in the story, police said.

Changing stories: Witnesses first told police that McLendon, pictured, was the victim of a home invasion, but later admitted to playing the deadly game 'Russian Roulette.'

A police investigation later found that the group had not been 
playing 'Russian Roulette' at all, and that Rady was holding a gun when he accidentally 
fired a shot that hit McLendon.

Rady turned himself in Thursday night at the Pinellas County 
Jail.

Surprisingly, 'Russian Roulette,' once memorably captured in the film Deer Hunter starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, has recently gained popularity.

In June, a 17-year-old died while playing the game with three other teens at his Largo, Florida home.

In September, a 35-year-old man was killed in San Bernardino, California after shooting himself while playing the game with friends.
