Style diva: Elocution lessons lowered Margaret Thatcher's 'too feminine' voice and power suits helped give her an authoritative edge

Elocution lessons lowered her 'too feminine' voice and power suits gave her an authoritative edge.

And research shows that women are emulating some of Margaret Thatcher's most well-known traits, in a bid to get ahead in the workplace.

Looking to the 1980s Prime Minister, whose tough image earned her the nickname the 'Iron Lady', females are adopting throatier voices, wearing longer hemlines and displaying less cleavage.

Findings suggest that 56.7 per cent 
dress more conservatively to boost their careers while almost have half 
perfect a more masculine tone.

Now
the trend is set to grow thanks to Phyllida Lloyd's biopic, in which 
Meryl Streep replicates Thatcher's iconic look and mannerisms on the big
screen.

Commenting on the survey carried out by One Poll for Business Environment, company CEO David Saul said: 'As the first major female leader of our 
times, it’s not completely unexpected that today’s women should want to 
emulate her in various ways – intentionally or not.

'Whilst it is still widely reported that
women still have some way to go in terms of boardroom equality, 
evidence suggests they are well on their way to the dizzy heights of 
‘Thatcherdom’ once again.'

In preparation for the film Iron Lady, costume designer Consolata Boyle,
describes Thatcher's 
image as 'fascinating'.

Boyle studied patterns and pieces from some of the former Prime Minister's favourite designers including Aquascutum and Jean Muir, before designing Streep's costumes.

As
the story unfolds we learn that Thatcher's style didn't emerge fully 
formed, but was gradually refined by image consultants, including 
television producer Gordon Reece, who trained her for the camera in 
1974.

Following his advice,
she refrained from wearing hats - although she refused to give up her 
pearls, a gift from her husband, Denis, when their twins were born in 
1953.

Taking inspiration from Thatcher, millionaire handbag entrepreneur Anya Hindmarch told Vogue: 'I am a lifelong fan of Margaret Thatcher.

'She was very much part of the get-up-and-go spirit and was a big influence on me and many others at the time I started my business.

'She is a strong and charismatic woman and was apparently a terrible flirt which I admire.

'Margaret Thatcher dressed as a strong woman and developed a style that was very much her own brand. The hair, the bow, the pearls and the handbag all became iconic.'

Despite flaunting more masculine characteristics, findings also suggest that 
modern businesswomen don't forget the power of the feminine touch.

Leading the way: Meryl Streep playing Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady dressed in one of many power suits

More than two thirds of the 2,000 surveyed (64.3 per cent) confessed to wearing 
more-make up to the office, perhaps an indication that whilst they value
the ‘power effect’, they 
realise the female touch can bring about success in other ways.

Mr Saul added: 'Although she’s widely
known for ruling with an iron fist, Margaret Thatcher actually 
revolutionised the way Britain does business. 

'She paved the way for the likes of 
Richard Branson and all the other entrepreneurs out there to think big 
and live their dreams.'

The Iron Lady is now showing at cinemas across the UK.
