A photographer fascinated by rural history has spent ten years touring the UK taking pictures of more than 170 shepherds' huts.

Agricultural expert David Morris, 50, has travelled thousands of miles indulging his passion for the countryside.

Shepherds' huts - or shepherds' wagons - were used for centuries by cattle herders during sheep raising and lambing.

David Morris has spent 10 years touring Britain to take pictures of shepherd's huts such as this Howcroft showman's van from the late 1890s, which is believed to be one of the finest examples in existence

As well as British huts, Mr Morris has sourced pictures from abroad such as this American sheep wagon

Mr Morris has now gathered so many images he has created a book ‘Shepherds’ Huts & Living Vans’ celebrating the humble farming beginnings.

The pictures feature huts of all shapes, sizes and designs from across the UK, as well as a number from France and America.

Mr Morris, of Somerton, Somerset, said: 'I have always been fascinated [by] rural history. It is something I understand because I grew up in the heart of a rural community.

'I used to restore huts myself and inevitably the historian in me just wanted to look for more. Soon I had so much information I wasn’t sure what to do with it.

'It was only when the shepherds' huts started becoming popular that I decided to make a book out of them.'

Mr Morris said his passion for shepherd's huts came from growing up in a rural community

The comfortable shepherds' huts are now making a comeback and are being used by campers

The curator of Aircraft, at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, Somerset, added that he had found records of shepherds' huts dating back to 1467.

In the 1800s, a shepherds' hut or living van would have been an unremarkable sight in many regions of rural Britain.

But by the 1970s most lay abandoned as farming methods and industry left them behind.

Today the humble shepherd’s hut is making a comeback and these quirky collectors' items are fast developing a cult status of their own.

Replica huts such as this one by Roundhill are being built in high numbers to satisfy increasing demand

They have seen a huge boom in popularity and are now widely used as alternative camping and garden offices.

Original huts and living vans command high sums and replica huts are being built in high numbers to satisfy demand.

Mr Morris' book includes a guide for people who want to renovate shepherds’ huts.
