Peter Clague, newly appointed headmaster at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire, has dismissed claims that he attacked his ex-wife

A newly appointed headmaster at one of Britain's leading public schools has been accused of brutally assaulting his ex-wife.

Peter Clague, 48, is due to move from New Zealand to take up the position as head of Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire on September 1.

A court hearing will take place later this month concerning the alleged attack, which is said to have taken place in September 2010.

His ex-wife, Jeanne Jackman, claims Mr Clague ran at her, shook her by the shoulders and pushed her on to the stairs, causing her to fracture her tailbone.

The incident, said to have taken place at the couple's former home in Greenhithe, Auckland, was not reported to police by Ms Jackman for more than two years.

The time lapse meant authorities could only issue Mr Clague with a warning under New Zealand law, without pursuing criminal charges.

Speaking in 2010, Ms Jackman heavily criticised the police's decision. 

She said: 'I believe this makes a mockery of calls to address domestic violence.

'Either we take the issue of domestic violence seriously in New Zealand, or we don't.'

Following her statement, Ms Jackman decided to seek justice for the alleged assault by launching a private prosecution case against her ex-husband. 

The Massey University psychology lecturer also claims that Mr Clague was psychologically abusive towards her.

But her ex-husband has dismissed the allegations, arguing that Ms Jackman invented them because she was 'angry over a break-up.' 

Mr Clague has already pleaded not guilty to the assault. 

Speaking two years ago, after court papers were submitted, he said: 'My career is on the whim of a woman who is angry over a break-up. 

'Principals don't come back from false allegations like this.'

Leading public school: The establishment charges £31,000 a year in fees and caters for 1,260 pupils

Bromsgrove School is a £31,000-a-year boarding school which caters for 1,260 pupils in its senior and preparatory school, pre-preparatory and nursery - with children aged between 2-18.

In 2010, it was rated as 'outstanding' in an Ofsted report. 

The school's governing body has vowed to stand by Mr Clague.

The Chairman of Governors, Stewart Towe, said: 'Bromsgrove School governors are wholly satisfied with the integrity of Peter Clague and followed due diligence in the appointment process.

'The governors are very much looking forward to welcoming the new headmaster and working with him to further develop the school's success.'

When  Mr Clague landed the job in the UK, Philippa Fee, Chairman of the Board at Kristin School, where he was working, paid tribute to his contribution.

Speaking from the school in Auckland, she said he was 'pivotal in establishing a positive and happy culture'.

After being unveiled as Bromsgrove's new headmaster last year, a school spokesman said: 'Peter Clague's appointment was the unanimous choice of the selection panel and the governing body are thrilled that he has accepted.'
