Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has projected that Argentina will be the most likely opponent if the hosts can make it all the way to the World Cup final.

Scolari says he and his staff analysed the tournament's bracket and predicted the two South American powers will meet in the July 13 final.

While Argentina is one of the chief threats to Brazil winning the tournament, Scolari wants them to do well, as a final between them would match 'great players' and two teams with 'a lot of quality' against each other.

Scolari said: 'Argentina I believe are the most likely to reach the final.

'I hope that, just by looking at the trip we have in front of us to the end, the final could be Brazil, and for the characteristics that I see in a team, by looking at various factors, it could be Argentina.

'I hope we can make it a Brazil-Argentina final, a South American final, with players that have great technical ability.

'I don't want Argentina to drop out beforehand. I want them to play their best football. If they lose, it's not my problem.

'My problem is Brazil. I have to take Brazil to the final, taking on whoever stands in our way.'

The rivals cannot meet at the World Cup until at least the semi-finals. If both teams finish first in their groups, they can only face each other in the final at the Maracana Stadium.

Brazil play their final World Cup warm-up match on Friday in Rio De Janeiro before the hosts gets their campaign underway next Thursday against Croatia.
