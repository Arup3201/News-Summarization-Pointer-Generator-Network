Australian TV presenter Laura Csortan has previously been accused of altering her Instagram photos

Further to this almost two thirds of women surveyed force friends to show them photos for approval before they're posted online, and 60 per cent untag themselves from images they aren't happy with.

Editing images before posting them on social media has become somewhat of a trend with celebrities, with everyone from Beyonce and Kim Kardashian to Aussie TV presenter Laura Csortan accused of altering their pictures.

Most Australian women are taking three or more selfies to make sure they've got the perfect angle before sharing it with others, while just over ten per cent snap more than ten pictures to ensure they've got the best shot.

'It seems there are double standards when it comes to photo editing,' Carli Alman, Editor of beautyheaven said of the research.

'Aussie women want it to stop in magazines but many are editing their own pics. 

 Despite editing their own images, over two thirds of Australian women say they are against magazines photoshopping pictures

'They've seen celebs like Beyoncé and Miranda Kerr looking perfect in their social media snaps, knowing many of these images have been edited and now there is a copycat effect.' Carli added. 

With the rise of apps such as the ModiFace Photo Editor, Photowonder and Perfect365, photo editing is becoming more and more common, as these are all accessible on a smart phone.

In line with Beyonce apparently editing her thighs in a number of her Instagram pictures, thighs are one of the body parts Australian women want to change most.

Stomachs and skin are also among the most commonly edited features, while one in five women just want to look slimmer all over.

Meantime 18 per cent of the ladies surveyed admitted that the profile picture on their social media page is so heavily edited it's a not a realistic representation of them.

Kris Jenner has also been accused of editing images: on the left is a photo posted by Gordon Ramsay, while the right image was later posted by Kris

Clinical Physcologist Dr Vivienne Lewis said body image dissatisfaction is 'becoming more and more of a problem for women'

Dr Vivienne Lewis, a Clinical Pyshcologist at University of Canberra, who specialises in body image issues, said body image dissatisfaction is 'becoming more and more of a problem for women'.

'The thing is they're constantly having to meet unrealistic standers of beauty,' Dr Lewis told Daily Mail Australia.

She said there is pressure to be slim, with clear skin, have a perfect facial structure, and just be traditionally beautiful, and social media can exacerbate this pressure.

'Women in particular who are very concerned about their bodies can spend hours editing photos,' Dr Lewis revealed.

'Social media is certainly putting us under more and more pressure to look our very best, and that often falls in line with the sort of ideals we see elsewhere.'

Dr Lewis said social media can exacerbate the desire to be traditionally beautiful

'It's all about celebrating body diversity and embracing your own uniqueness' Dr Lewis said

The body image expert added that because there is access to photo editing apps, there is an expectation to use them. But she said women need to embrace the way they - and those around them - look. 

'It's the judgement of others that women get concerned about and comparisons to other women.

'It's all about celebrating body diversity and embracing your own uniqueness. The more and more people who are able to accept others for what they look like.. the more likely we are to do it to ourselves', Dr Lewis said.

Carli from beautyheaven echoed these sentiments, saying: 'It’s normal to want to look good in pictures but it’s important we are having fun with our social media images and not taking it too far.'

'Look to beauty products to enhance things like your skin and fun poses to make you look slimmer before you turn to major editing tools. 

'And remember it’s you who your social media friends want to see!' she added.
