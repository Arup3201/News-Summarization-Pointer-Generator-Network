Archaeologists in the Netherlands claim to have found the world’s oldest telescope.

Dating back to the 17th century, it could predate any other telescope known to be in existence.

The find was made during digging works for a railway tunnel in the city of Delft in South Holland.

Astronomers in the Netherlands claim to have found the oldest working telsecope in the world. It will be on display in the city of Delft's Prinsenhof museum, which is being reopened by King Willem-Alexander on 23 May

The small, cylindrical tin tube doesn’t look like much at first glance.

1608 - German spectacle maker Hans Lipperhey’s patent application heralds the invention of the telescope.

1609 - Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei is the first to use a telescope for astronomy.

1670 - Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius creates a large refracting telescope that is 150 feet long and hangs from ropes on a pole.

1781 - Astronomer Sir William Herschel from Britain discovers Uranus with a hand-made reflecting telescope.

1897 - A 40-inch (one metre) telescope is built at Yerkes Observatory, Wisconsin. It remains the largest refracting telescope ever built.

1917 - The 100-inch (2.5 metres) Hooker telescope is built in California, and was later used in 1924 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble to determine that our Milky Way was just one of many galaxies.

1990 - Nasa launches the Hubble Space Telescope, which has since observed our universe in unprecedented detail.

In fact, experts initially thought it might simply be a bullet chamber.

But specialists from Museum Boerhaave in Leiden confirmed it is indeed a telescope, if a little rusty.

It was not, however, the finest piece of work at the time.

The lenses inside were found to be of poor quality with a lot of unevenness.

Nonetheless the pocket-sized device, about four inches (10cm) long, could still magnify objects by up to five times.

‘Especially the frontmost glass is so primitive that it was hardly recognizable as a lens,' curator Tiemen Cocquyt of Boerhaven told NL Times.

‘But after cleaning, the telescope really works again.’

The discovery is significant as it comes from the Dutch Golden Age, a period during the 17th century when Dutch trade, science, military and art were the most prestigious in the world.

In the early 17th century the city of Delft was apparently a well-known producer of lens viewers.

However,
 no telescopes are thought to have survived from that period - only some
 from the second half of the century have been found.

But this telescope, discovered in a submerged ditch, could be the oldest yet.

The reason experts think it is from the first half of the century is that it is a primitive tin scope of unknown origin.

By 1650, tin was no longer used for telescopes and much better glass was available.

This suggests it was merely a gadget owned by an affluent citizen of Delft.

‘The
 tin looks gilded in places, which points to the fact that it was a 
serious and valuable instrument, only in a time when the technique was 
not very advanced,’ said Cocquyt.

The telescope, dating back to the first half of the 17th century is about four inches (10 centimetres) long and is made of tin. Although it has undergone rusting it is still able to magnify distant objects five times

The telescope was believed to have been invented by German spectacle maker Hans Lipperhey in 1608, but it was not used for astronomy until Galileo (artist's illustration shown) in 1609
