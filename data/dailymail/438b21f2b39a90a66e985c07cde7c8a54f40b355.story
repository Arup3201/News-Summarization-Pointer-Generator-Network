If she was expecting a moment's peace, this mother panda bear was sadly mistaken.

For not long after she had clambered into her custom made swing for a well-earned afternoon nap - she was joined by her energetic young cub.

The adorable pair were captured cuddling and playfully nibbling at each other in the suspended net at Vienna Zoo in Austria.

Exasperating: The mother panda had been hoping for an afternoon nap before being joined by her adorable and playful young cub 

Austrian wildlife photographer Josef Gelernter, 33, took the heartwarming photographs while crowds of visitors watched.

He said: 'They were definitely enjoying themselves and it was obvious they were having a great time playing and cuddling together.

'They spent about ten minutes playing in the swing before the mother decided to call it a day, I imagine looking after a panda cub is hard work.

'My heart melted when I saw them in the swing together - the keepers said it was rare for them to use the swing let alone get in there together.

I can't stay mad at you! The mother panda appears to relent and embraces her young cub

'I don't think they were actually swinging in it but when the cub tried to climb in, it made the whole thing move, which made it even funnier.

'There were many people watching, I think it's because there is something special about watching mother and child interact together, especially animals as cute as these two.'

The mother panda finally cut her losses and left the swing - leaving her baby to clamber around on the hanging net alone.

The cute cub was pictured clinging on to the edge of the swing as he struggled to get back on.
