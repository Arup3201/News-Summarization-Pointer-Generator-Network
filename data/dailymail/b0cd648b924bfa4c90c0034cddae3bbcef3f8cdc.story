Australia's newest online streaming service, billed as a rival to US giant Netflix, has officially launched on Australia Day.

Stan, built in partnership between Fairfax and Nine Entertainment, costs $10 per month and promises just over 750 TV shows, films and documentaries for online viewing.

It comes ahead of the launch of Netflix Down Under, and after Foxtel's new streaming service launched earlier this month, as the video on demand revolution heats up in Australia.

Stan subscribers will be able to watch the Breaking Bad spin-off series Better Call Saul first when it premiers online on Monday, February 9.

The service also has exclusive rights to shows such as Mozart In The Jungle and American comedy-drama television series and Golden Globe winner Transparent. 

Joining the lineup of exclusives - thanks to deals signed with Sony, BBC Worldwide, ABC, SBS, and Viacom - will be shows including Masters of Sex, Hannibal, Ray Donovan, Californication, The Good Wife, Sherlock, Call the Midwife, Top Gear and Doctor Who.

A selection of Australian programming will also be available on Stan, such as Ja'mie Private School Girl, Redfern Now and Rake, plus all seasons of Underbelly, House Husbands and Love Child.

Mike Sneesby, CEO of Stan, said: 'We know there's been some speculation around Stan's launch date, and while we've had to keep it under wraps we're really proud to be able to announce that Australia's new streaming service will launch on Australia Day.' 

Netflix is due to kick off in March but the big question still remains unanswered... 

Will Australian Netflix subscribers be able to watch its original award-winning shows House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black?

American Golden Globe Award-winning show Transparent is also available for viewing on Stan

Netflix Australia won't confirm if the two popular shows will be available and it's believed to be because of licensing agreements already in place with pay TV operator Foxtel.

They are reportedly now scrambling for deals to try and salvage the rights from Foxtel. 

The new trailer for House Of Cards has been released advertising that season three will air via Netflix in the United States from February 27.

But when the Australian branch Netflix launches on its rumoured March 31 date, the show will already be a month behind.
