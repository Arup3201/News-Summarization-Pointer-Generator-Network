Google has become so much a part of everyday life many people now use the brand name as a verb for searching, but a new map highlights exactly how far and wide the site spreads across the globe. 

The map, created by researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute, used data from millions of people's browsing history worldwide and shows Google as the most popular site, in 62 countries.

Facebook was the second most visited site globally, in 50 countries, while the third place site - China's Baidu search engine, was popular in just two countries.

The map, pictured, was created by researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute. It used data from millions of people's browsing history worldwide and shows Google as the most popular site, in 62 countries, shown in red. Facebook, shown in blue, was the second most visited site globally, in 50 countries

To work out the number of visitors, 
Dr Mark Graham and Stefano De Sabbata from the institute combined the 
number of estimated average daily unique visitors, with the estimated 
number of page views for that site from users in a particular country, 
for the previous month.

The
 data shown in the map covers the period of July and August this year 
and uses information collected by website analytics firm Alexa, through 
browser extensions.

Each colour represents that most visited website in the country and each three block represents around one million users.

Each colour represents that most visited website in that country and each three individual blocks represent around one million users. 

The countries are unusual sizes as the 
map effectively exaggerates countries that almost exclusively use one 
type of search engine.

Google is shown in red, Facebook is blue. Yahoo is shown in purple and has a stronghold over Japan, while China's favourite site is the search engine Baidu.

Baidu is also popular in Korea, ahead of the country's own search engine Naver.

The majority of most-visited sites 
were search engines, but Facebook was also popular.

Although Facebook was predominantly popular in the west, it was also the most visited site in Nepal and Mongolia.

The Al-Watan Voice newspaper was 
the most visited website in the Palestinian Territories, the email 
service Mail.ru is the most visited site in Kazakhstan, the social network VK
 was the most visited in Belarus, and the search engine Yandex was the most popular site in Russia.

The researchers said: 'The
 supremacy of Google and Facebook over any other site on the Web is 
clearly apparent. We also see an interesting geographical continuity of 
these two 'empires'.

'The situation is more complex in Asia, as local competitors have been able to resist the two large American empires.

'At the same time, we see a puzzling fact that Baidu is also listed as the most visited website in South Korea - ahead of the popular search engine Naver.

'We speculate that the raw data that we are using here are skewed. However, we may also be seeing the Baidu empire in the process of expanding beyond its traditional home territory.'

Areas in sub-saharan Africa aren't covered by Alexa, yet Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, and South Africa are within the sphere of Google’s empire. Whereas Ghana, Senegal, and Sudan prefer Facebook.

On this map the countries bathed in blue are used to depict the global spread of Facebook, as of September 2013. The map shows a rising popularity in Africa, South America, and India - as also highlighted in the Oxford Institute map

Among the 50 countries where Facebook was listed as the most visited visited website, 36 of them had Google as the second most visited, with the remaining 14 countries listing YouTube, the Google-owned video site. 

The countries where Google is the most visited website account for half of the entire internet population - over one billion people.

A large proportion of the population in China and South Korea use the internet, giving Baidu second place overall in terms of visitors.

The 50 Facebook countries account for about 280 million users, placing the social network in third.

'We are likely still in the very beginning of the Age of Internet Empires,' the researchers conclude.

'But, it may well be that the territories carved out now will have important implications for which companies end up controlling how we communicate and access information for many years to come.'
