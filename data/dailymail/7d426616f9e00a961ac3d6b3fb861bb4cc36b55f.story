Andy Murray’s hometown today sent their congratulations to their local hero after he announced his engagement to long-term love Kim Sears.

Children made colourful cards congratulating the tennis ace on his love game, while the local butchers created a message in sausage.

And Murray’s beaming gran joked: 'It’s about time'.

Shirley Erskine, 83, said she was delighted to reveal her good news after being initially sworn to secrecy.

Celebrations commence: Dunblane business's and residents congratulated their local hero Andy Murray today on his engagement to Kim Sears. Andy's granny Shirley Erskine is pictured here with congratulation cards  made by kids at the Dunblane Centre.

Speaking at her Dunblane home, she said: 'We’re delighted. Kim is a lovely girl. Andy phoned and said "just to tell you, I proposed to Kim today". His grandpa Roy and I were thrilled.

'Roy told him "I hope she said yes". I asked, "can I give my congratulations to Kim", and he said "she’s right here".

'He passed the phone to Kim. She was very excited - we all were. I’m told it’s a lovely ring. Kim has been such a great support to Andy through all his highs and lows.

'We couldn’t be happier for them both.'

Mrs Erskine agreed to deliver to her grandson handmade cards created by local children at the Dunblane Centre, adding: 'They’re brilliant. He’ll love them.'

Marco McCool, 10, whose card read 'Andy + Kim 4 ever', said: 'Andy’s an amazing tennis player – and now he’s a very lucky guy.'

Katie Wales, aged eight, added: 'I want to say well done – Kim’s lovely.'

Thrilled: Speaking at her Dunblane home, Shirley said: 'We're delighted. Kim is a lovely girl. His grandpa Roy and I were thrilled'

Gemma Greer, centre manager, said: 'Everyone is really excited. We watch all Andy’s games and have gone through all his ups and downs.

'Everyone’s hoping they will be married at Andy’s hotel, Cromlix House. It would be lovely if Dunblane was able to give them a good send off for married life.

'It will be the event of the year.'

One person posted a congratulations message, complete with love hearts, on the City of Dunblane sign welcoming visitors to Murray’s home.

Even the Dunblane butcher was celebrating – with a congratulatory message reading 'Andy and Kim', with a love-heart all made out of sausage.

Butcher Connor Wilson, 22, of Bennett’s of Dunblane, said: 'It’s our way of saying congratulations and all the best.

'Hopefully the wedding will be in Dunblane and we can treat Andy and Kim to a nice big steak.'

Andy’s old school pal, Stewart McClymont, 27, said: 'When we were kids all we talked about was football and wrestling, but we’ve all grown up and I couldn’t be more pleased for him.

'Kim’s a lovely girl. She’s down to earth, easy going and obviously exactly what Andy needs. They seem perfectly suited.'

Pub landlord Alan Duncan, 48, who has shown all of Andy’s big matches at the Dunblane Hotel in recent years, said: 'We all wish Andy and Kim many more happy years together. It’s not been his best year on the court but he’s still managed to end the season on a high note.' 

Andy proposed to Kim Sears, 26, last week with a diamond ring he chose himself and she immediately said ‘yes’.

Sources said the couple had hoped to keep their engagement secret for some time and have not yet made plans for their wedding.

Murray, 27, who flew to the Philippines for a tennis tournament yesterday, had not even shared his happy news with some of his closest family members.

The sportsman’s mother Judy said last night that she was ‘thrilled’, but his grandmother said she had heard only ‘rumours’.

Since last year becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title since 1936, Murray has repeatedly batted off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him.

But he popped the question last Wednesday, placing a painstakingly selected engagement ring on her finger.

Miss Sears was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005.

Murray wooed her with phone calls and flowers. But she did not allow their burgeoning romance to affect her schoolwork, and she achieved straight As in her exams. The couple managed to keep their relationship quiet – until Murray won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to give his girlfriend a kiss.

They separated briefly in 2009, reportedly because of the sports star’s video games obsession, but rekindled their romance after six months and have stayed together since. She has been credited with improving the tennis player’s scruffy appearance and helping him to control his fiery temper on court.

Murray, who grew up in Dunblane in Scotland, has spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11. ‘I work better in a relationship. At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,’ he said in 2009.

The couple live in a £5.6million house in Oxshott, Surrey, with their two Border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May. There had been a series of rumours that Murray was about to propose to Miss Sears before their engagement was officially confirmed yesterday.

In January he jokingly tweeted: ‘We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.’ The message prompted Twitter users to offer their congratulations, until he admitted that it was just ‘tongue-in-cheek’. Murray has already spoken of how he would like to have children with Miss Sears.

In his 2013 memoir Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, he wrote: ‘I would like to start a family and try to be a good father. That’s important to me. It’s something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’

Last night Mrs Murray, 55, who was recently voted off Strictly Come Dancing, said simply: ‘I’m thrilled.’

The sports star’s grandmother Shirley Erskine added: ‘I know there have been rumours but that’s as much as we know. It would be nice, without a doubt.’

A spokesman for Murray confirmed that the star had become engaged but declined to give any further details.
