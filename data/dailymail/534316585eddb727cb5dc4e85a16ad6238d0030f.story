Labour MP Diane Abbott was today forced to defend her decision to publicly question the outcome of the Mark Duggan inquest.

The former frontbencher said she was ‘baffled’ and ‘startled’ by the jury’s ruling that Mr Duggan’s killing was lawful.

But she faced criticism for appearing to second guess the jury, which spent months examining the evidence of what happened in the moments before the police shot Mr Duggan dead in August 2011.

Armed police will be given body-worn video cameras to try and restore public trust following the shooting of Mark Duggan.

Police marksman were criticised for their accounts of the incident which differed from members of the public.

Equipping officers with video cameras would help cut out 'opinions and conjecture' similar to those that have plagued the Duggan investigation.

The central question raised by the disputed evidence was whether Duggan, a known drug dealer and member of the notorious Tottenham Mandem, was armed as he emerged from a taxi before being shot.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: 'Is it possible to rule out a situation where it turns out the person wasn't holding a lethal weapon? No it's not.'

He explained that that issues from imitation firearms to poor lighting mean mistakes are inevitable.

He said: 'You can't avoid that, but the officer by law has to justify that they reasonably believed that there was such imminent risk of lethal force being used against them or some other person that they had no choice but to pull the trigger. It's a very high bar.'

The killing of the 29-year-old gangster in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011 sparked the outbreak of 
rioting and looting across the country.

Amid fears of a fresh outbreak of violence following the inquest, riot police have been put on standby across the capital.

The
 father-of-six's aunt Carole defiantly raised her fist outside court 
yesterday and vowed 'no justice, no peace' and said that police had 
'executed' her nephew.

But 
in an about turn this morning, she called for 'no more violence' and 
said they would seek justice through the courts - rather than on the 
streets.

However, the family plan to hold a 
vigil in Tottenham at the weekend and there are concerns that the event 
could spark unrest in a repeat of what happened immediately after he was
 killed in 2011.

Today 
David Cameron appealed for a calm response to the verdict that Mr Duggan
 was lawfully killed by a police marksman despite being unarmed.

The Prime Minister said he hoped people would respect the 'proper judicial process'.

Speaking to BBC London, he said: 
'I very much respect Mark Duggan's aunt for saying they want to pursue 
their case through the courts rather than on the streets, I think that's
 absolutely right.

'These
 issues raise very strong emotions but I hope people can react calmly 
and recognise that we have proper judicial processes in this country and
 they are the ones that must be followed and respected.'

Miss
 Abbott, who was in Ed Miliband’s frontbench team until last October, 
sparked controversy when she tweeted after the inquest: ‘If the Duggan 
jury believe that he did not have a gun in his hand when he was shot, 
how can they find it was a lawful killing?’

She later said there would be ‘questions to be asked’.

Tory MP Henry Smith condemned the 
remarks: ‘We have a system of courts in this country. I don’t think it’s
 appropriate for people to second guess the verdict of a court that has 
followed due process.

‘Given
 the events of the summer of 2011 community leaders and politicians need
 to be very careful of their language and not say things that inflame 
matters.’

Miss Abbott was repeatedly challenged live on air today about whether an elected politician should appear to question the outcome of a British court.

She accused Sky News presenter Kay Burley of not doing their viewers a ‘service’ by focusing on her comments instead of the wider issues the case raised.

Under pressure, she said: ‘I am not second guessing the jury today but I was taken aback but that’s different from saying I am in some way trying to challenge the jury.

‘But what I am challenging is you harping on about this issue rather than the issues facing the area of Tottenham.’

Nick Clegg said there are 'questions 
to be asked' about how investigations into police shootings are handled 
after an inquest found Mark Duggan was lawfully killed despite being 
unarmed.

The Deputy 
Prime Minister said he 'totally understood' the angry reaction to the 
finding in some quarters, but stressed the case had been considered by a
 jury.

Tensions 
appeared to have been heightened because communications between officers
 and local people broke down during the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC) probe, he said.

Commissioner
 Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will meet political representatives from the 
capital and prominent figures from Tottenham today to discuss how the 
police can improve relationships. He said he is 'open to ideas and 
advice'.

Speaking on his 
weekly LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: 'I can totally understand and I
 think the commissioner is quite right to say this morning that he also 
understands why that has caused as much anxiety, concern, in some cases 
outright anger among members of the community, his family and friends.

'I am sure there are questions that need to be asked, not only about how some of these investigations are conducted.'

The Liberal Democrat leader went on: 'At the end of the day in this case, this is a jury. This is a jury just like a court jury.'

Mr Clegg backed a move to equip all armed police with cameras so such events are recorded.

He added: 'This is really, really difficult, it is a very, very difficult time. It is a time of great anxiety in Tottenham.

David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham said parts of the verdict were ‘perplexing and seemingly contradictory’.

But he added: ‘This was a ten-person jury that heard over three months of evidence, testimonies and expert accounts and took seven days to reach a decision.

‘The issues have been thoroughly discussed and debated, and the jury’s findings should be respected.’

Today the Metropolitan Police continued efforts to rebuild trust over the controversial killing, which sparked a wave of rioting and looting across the country.

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe met political representatives from the capital and prominent figures from Tottenham to discuss how the police can improve relationships.

Speaking after meeting Britain's most senior police officer, the Rev Nims Obunge, who buried Mr Duggan, said: 'We had an interesting meeting with the commissioner and he has clearly expressed concern about what would happen in Tottenham.

'We've just looked at the best way forward to ensure that the concerns that the family genuinely have about the verdict can be expressed in an effective fashion at the vigil this weekend, and we also want to ensure that policing within our community is done in a healthy fashion.

'The message from the family is that this vigil is intended to be a very peaceful vigil. We expect that anybody who would come would stand with the family. It is a vigil in remembrance and respecting the life and death of Mark Duggan. His children will be there, and we don't expect anybody to come to where Mark Duggan's children are to create unrest or anarchy.'

The 29-year-old's family reacted furiously yesterday as jurors concluded that he was lawfully killed by police.

Mr Nims, who was with them at the Royal Courts of Justice as the conclusions were revealed, said: 'They are hurting. It was a very challenging verdict. Hearing that your son was unarmed at the time he was shot, that the jury believed he was unarmed at the time he was shot, that was challenging for the family.'
