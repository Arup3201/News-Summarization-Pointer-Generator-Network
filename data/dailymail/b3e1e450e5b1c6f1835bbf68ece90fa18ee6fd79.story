A 22-year-old climber fell over 300 feet to his death yesterday while scaling a ridge on Britain's highest mountain.

Ben St Jospeh, from Essex, was climbing Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis when he fell into the gully below.

Two fellow climbers saw the man fall at 11am and Lochaber Mountain Rescue were called out and a Royal Navy helicopter from Prestwick was also dispatched.

The man, who is in his 20s or early 30s, was about 2,800 feet up the 4,409 feet mountain when he dropped.

John Stevenson, team leader of 
Lochaber Mountain Rescue, said it 'did not look good' when the man was found.

He said: 'We
think he was climbing on his own. We do not know which part of the 
Tower he fell from - but he was seen by two other climbers fall a long 
way.

'He must have fallen at least 400 feet. It is a long fall from where we think he was.'

Police at Fort William confirmed the man had 'sustained fatal injuries'.

An investigation has been launched and a report is being prepared.

The ridge, which is popular with climbers, is almost 3,000 feet long and has almost 2,000 feet of ascent.

Tower Ridge is one of several rocky ridges protruding north west from the summit plateau.

His death came just one week after four climbers were killed in an avalanche in Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.

On Saturday the avalanche risk was 'high' - the second highest category - but Mr Stevenson said he did not think an avalanche caused the man to fall.

He said: 'It is just one of those tragic things - it is one of the risks that climbers take.

'The Tower Ridge is probably the most popular climbing route - both in summer and winter - on the Ben. The conditions were pretty good. He was just on the verge of cloud level.'

The previous Saturday Tom Chesters, 28, from Leeds, his girlfriend Dr Rachel Majumdar, 29, who was working at Harrogate District Hospital in Yorkshire, junior doctor Una Rachel Finnegan, 25, from County Antrim, Northern Ireland and Christopher Bell, from Blackburn all died after the 1000-feet fall descending Glencoe.

A 24-year-old woman remains in hospital - having been transferred from the Belford Hospital in Fort William to the Southern General in Glasgow - and a sixth climber survived.

Meanwhile, emergency services were called to hills near Roybridge, north of Fort William, on Saturday evening after reports that two walkers had got lost in bad weather.
