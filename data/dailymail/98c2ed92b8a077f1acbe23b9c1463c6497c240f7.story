A bog in Birmingham might not be the most obvious choice for a beauty spot but it is one of the unexpected delights listed in the new top 50 most inspiring hidden urban gems in the UK.

Alongside the bog, other secret top spots included are a former custard factory, a concrete tower block and a brewery.

The unusual list has been created in a bid to reconnect people with their home cities and discover new places of inspiration.

Life on the water: Houseboats in Little Venice on the Regent's Canal, London make the Top 50

Brewing up a storm: The centre for contemporary art and learning in the HQ of the former Tetley Brewery makes the grade

Blue green dream: The Science Garden outside the Think Tank Science Museum at Millennium Point, Birmingham

Research shows 87 per cent of people admit not taking advantage of what is around them in their home town or city, with a further 43 per cent acknowledging they are missing out on what their cities have to offer.

In response to the study, American Express compile the list of hidden gems in 
partnership with a collective of some of the nation's most influential 
bloggers and their communities.

Melissa Weber at American Express said: 'The cities we live in are brimming with potential, but we only appreciate a fraction of what they have to offer.

'That's why we've called on people to share their personal places, hideaways and havens in the city to create maps of the UK's most inspirational spaces, so that everyone can discover something new to love about their city.'
