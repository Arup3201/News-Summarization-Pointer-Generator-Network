Rangers have problems that run much deeper than a Scottish Cup defeat to a team from the same division. But there was something about Sunday's loss to Raith Rovers — exactly the kind of side you don’t want encounter in the middle of a crisis — that felt particularly damning. And historic.

This was Raith’s first win against Rangers at Ibrox since 1959, when a lad by the name of Jim Baxter scored in their 3-2 triumph. If none of the current Rovers squad appears destined to achieve the same kind of mythical status as Baxer, the same — and more — could be said of the hopeless bunch now representing the ‘other’ club he went on to serve with such elegant ease.

Whoever would have thought Richard Gough was being kind when he branded this lot the worst Rangers team in history? They would have to improve to be mediocre. They are hanging on to miserable by their fingertips.

Raith won this game, securing themselves a place in today’s quarter-final draw, with something to spare. In Grant Anderson, they had the best player on the park, while Christian Nade spent the entire afternoon buying time and space for his team-mates, holding the ball up and bringing others into play.

A beautiful Ryan Conroy free-kick and a Nade tap-in — following another horrible howler involving Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen and his defenders — came either side of a debut goal from Haris Vuckic, who at least justified his inclusion in the team.

Which is more than could be said for some of his more established team-mates.

Seriously, Ian Black? If there is an example of a player’s career going from zenith to nadir in a more spectacular fashion, somebody should turn it into a book. Misery memoirs are always best sellers. The only time he earned a cheer was when the board went up for his substitution.

Even then, he was immediately booed for appearing to dawdle off the park. It’s hard to see a way back for him now the fans have so unanimously turned against him.

The way things are going at Rangers, of course, he and some of his under-performing team-mates could soon lose their places to a five-a-side unit of new loan signings, the first two of whom began their controversial Ibrox careers yesterday.

The order to field all fit on-loan Newcastle United players saw centre-half Remie Streete replace Darren McGregor, while Fraser Aird lost his place on the wing to Vuckic.

Streete limped off injured just before half-time. But the 20-year-old did a few decent things in his 43 minutes on the park.

Vuckic got his goal and showed promise in flashes. To say he was one of the better Rangers players on the day may damn him with faint praise but, given time and a guaranteed run in the team, he should improve.

As for what the imposition of him and his Newcastle mates does to the rest of the team, well, the early signs are not good.

Fans who had gathered for a muted protest before the game — their impact deadened by the Easdale brothers and chief executive Derek Llambias staying away — clearly don’t like anything spawned by the partnership between the current board and Newcastle owner Mike Ashley.

There was widespread applause when a group of fans unfurled a banner showing a trainer stamping on two rats with pound signs in their eyes, one representing McGill’s Buses, the other Sports Direct.

There wasn’t much else for the home crowd to cheer in a first half that saw Raith come closer to scoring than their hosts.

Paul Watson thought he had broken the deadlock when his glancing header from a Conroy corner went fizzing towards the back post — only to strike the upright and bounce straight into the grateful arms of Simonsen.

That was a let-off for Rangers, who looked bogged down in midfield, sluggish up front and far too open to the counter-attack and could not complain about being booed off at half-time.

Raith? With Anderson a genuine threat on the flank, Kevin Moon adding energy to midfield and the redoubtable Dougie Hill leading the back line, they looked comfortable.

The second half began with Nade robbing the hapless Black before charging into the box and setting up a decent spell of pressure.

They took the lead with 54 minutes gone, Conroy curling and dipping his left-footed free-kick over the wall and inside the post, a just punishment for Kyle Hutton diving in illegally to prevent Ross Callachan getting a shot on target from the edge of the box.

When Vuckic equalised eight minutes later, well, there once was a time when that would have been the signal for a Rangers onslaught. Not here. Not now.

Instead, it was Raith who grew stronger. The visitors stretched the opposition defence with surging runs and daring dashes. One of which produced the winner.

Anderson was again involved, driving down the right wing and laying the ball off to captain Jason Thomson, whose fiery low cross should have been held by Simonsen — but was spilled under pressure from Raith sub Mark Stewart and at least two home defenders. Nade charged in to bury the loose ball.

Raith deserved their win. Rangers deserved the chorus of boos and insults flung in their direction as they traipsed off the field, victims of a defeat that — given the ‘upsets’ suffered by the Ibrox club in recent seasons — qualifies as a Cup shock only on a technicality.
