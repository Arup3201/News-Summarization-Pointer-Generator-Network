It's the question on every traveller's lips: 'When is the best time to book cheap flights?'

And now, thanks to the people at CheapAir and Skyscanner, there's finally an answer.

After analysing data from more than four million airline trips over the past year, US-based CheapAir has devised a scientific formula to help holidaymakers secure bargain prices.

Happy holidays: Booking five weeks in advance is the optimal time for cheap flights, says the study

The answer is - domestic flights are at their cheapest 54 days before takeoff, which could save travellers up to £190. While the worst time to book a cheap flight is last minute - with the day before departure the most expensive.

The next biggest mistake travellers make when looking to book cheap flights, is buying them too far in advance, according to the findings based on travel throughout the US.

CheapAir said airlines usually open domestic flights for sale 331 days in advance, with fares in the first four months 'pretty steady, and pretty high'. 

The cheap flights formula advises 
holidaymakers to book between 225 days and 104 before flying when prices
fall to within $10 (£6) of their lowest point.

Prime booking window: The CheapAir research indicates booking flights between 29-104 days in advance

Flight prices continue to fall until reaching their cheapest at 54 days before takeoff, remaining to within $10 of their low until 29 days before departure, when they start to increase again.

CheapAir said: 'We found that each 
individual trip had an average of 92 fare changes between the time 
fights opened for sale and the time they departed. 

'For
domestic flights, the average difference between buying a ticket on the
best possible day to buy and the worst was $312 (£190).

'The
$312 difference between buying at the right time and the wrong time 
drives home the point that the decision of when to buy really does make a
huge impact on what you end up paying.'

Big savings: Skyscanner research shows US flights can cost up to £764 less by booking at a certain time

The
findings back research by travel comparison site Skyscanner today, 
which says the ideal time to bag the best-price flights is about five 
weeks in advance.

For UK holidaymakers heading to 
Cyprus, flights are at their cheapest four weeks before takeoff (saving 
£251); for Croatia it's six weeks (saving £195); for Germany it's nine 
weeks (saving £185); for Turkey it's 13 weeks (saving £256); and for the
States it's 21 weeks (saving £764).

Skyscanner’s
Mary Porter said: 'We analysed three years’ worth of data, representing
200 million searches, in order to be able to provide some clarity to 
the question of when is the best time to book. 

Cheap flights: The most expensive plane trips are booked last minute, according to the findings

'We found five weeks is the best time to book on average, however it is very much dependent on destination.

'Of course, many people will be more comfortable booking further in advance, especially as prices close to departure can be quite volatile. 

'Therefore if customers really want to get the very best deal for them our advice would be not to stick to a rigid five week rule, but instead to research prices and track fares for that route by signing up for price alerts, allowing you to see when low fares become available.'
