Deserving: Alan Yentob defended his £330,000 salary while complaining about the amount of money the BBC pay top stars

With several lucrative BBC salaries to his name, he is known to envious colleagues as ‘Two-Jobs’.

But it seems even fat cat Alan Yentob feels hard done by compared with some of the corporation’s biggest stars.

The 66-year-old executive -  who is paid around £333,000 a year as the BBC’s creative director and arts presenter – has admitted he feels  uneasy with the amount its top talent is paid.

Appearing in a panel discussion at the Radio Academy’s festival in Salford yesterday, Yentob agreed the ‘huge amounts of money’ thrown at presenters such as Graham Norton and Gary Lineker were unfair.

During the question and answer session – which was aired on Radio 5 Live – he responded to angry comments made by radio listener Chris Jones, who complained he felt ‘betrayed’ by high levels of BBC pay.

He also objected more generally to the huge salaries earned by top Premiership footballers such as Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.

Mr Jones said: ‘A lot of stars are paid huge amounts of money, and yet you’ve got Joe Public who earns around £25,000 a year, which to a lot of these people is nothing.

'Wayne Rooney plays football for a week, and I have to work 35 years to make what he earns for a week. How’s that fair? You’ve got the likes of Graham Norton and Gary Lineker [at the BBC].’

It is thought Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC.

Wayne Rooney – who does not earn a BBC salary – earns an estimated £15.6million a year from Manchester United and commercial endorsements.

Mr Yentob attempted to defend BBC salaries by saying they were lower than those earned at its commercial rival ITV, but admitted: ‘I agree with you about what Wayne Rooney earns. I agree with you about what presenters of all kinds earn, including [5 Live presenter] Richard [Bacon] and I and others.’

Double dip: Alan Yentob is paid both for his job as an editor for Imagine, pictured presenting with singer Emeli Sande, as well as the position of creative director of the BBC

However, Yentob justified his own pay by saying he was ‘valuable’ to the BBC because of his ‘relationship with talent’ and ‘understanding of the networks and the schedules’.

The arts ‘supremo’ is paid one salary of £183,300 as BBC creative director, and another as editor and presenter of arts series Imagine.

He has refused to reveal how much this extra income is, and it is not declared on the BBC’s official register. But BBC insiders say it is ‘easily’ in the region of £150,000 a year.

The executive is also understood to have accrued a pension pot worth £6million during his decades of working at the Corporation.

Yentob also defended the huge earnings of Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson, who raked in £13.3million by selling his production company to the BBC last year and also earns a salary of around £1million paid out of the licence fee.

Yentob said: ‘Jeremy does make a lot of money. However, the franchise of Top Gear is the most successful factual programme in the world. So a large amount of money comes in, significantly more than anything Jeremy gets, into the BBC, and goes back into the licence fee through BBC Worldwide. There are in any society, any environment some people who do  particularly well but he is making money, and that format is making money, for the BBC.’

Salary: Helen Boaden, the head of BBC radio and the former head of news, takes home £340,000 a year

The BBC has been heavily criticsed for spending millions on salaries for executive and senior staff.

Last month, MPs grilled seven managers, past and present, who earned a staggering £1.6million a year between them.

The top earner was ex-director general Mark Thompson, who raked in £670,000 a year while Lucy Adams, human resources director, enjoyed a salary of £320,000.

Last month it was also revealed that the
broadcasters had hired a string of executives on salaries of more than 
£200,000 in the past 12 months.

The BBC Trust commissioned a study of basic salaries in 2009 and found many were on a par with the those at top FTSE 100 companies.

What the bosses are paid:

Tony Hall, director general: £450,000

Anne Bulford, managing director of BBC operations and finance: £395,000

Helen Boaden, director of radio and former head of news: £340,000

James Harding, director of news and current affairs: £340,000

Danny Cohen, director, BBC television: £327,800

James Purnell, director of strategy and digital: £295,000

Lord Patten, BBC Trust Chairman: £110,000
