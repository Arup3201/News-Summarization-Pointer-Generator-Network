Liberace is heading back to the stage 28 years after his death thanks to some technological tricks.

The flamboyant performer, who passed away in 1987, will be projected on stage as a hologram at some point this year - first in Las Vegas and then during a tour across the U.S.

It comes after the late Michael Jackson appeared on stage at last year's Billboard Music Awards. In 2012, Tupac also returned to the stage at Coachella Music Festival.

Hologram USA - the team behind Tupac's act - are now plotting Liberace's return, and hope that he will be able to interact with members of the audience, Forbes reported.

Coming to a stage near you: Liberace, who passed away in 1987, is touring the U.S. this year - but it'll be thanks to tricks involving light and glass, which will make him appear on stage as a sort of hologram

Jonathan Warren, the chairman of the Liberace Foundation, said in a statement last year that the audience will 'feel the warmth from his heart, the sparkle of his eye and the pure lightening from his fingertips'.

'In the end, history is to be re-lived, not rewritten, a legend never dies,' he said. 

The foundation has supplied Hologram USA with footage and artifacts for the full-length show, but it is not yet known when the show will begin or what songs he will perform.

'This is a major step in the evolution of this medium for entertainment,' Hologram USA CEO Alki David said in a statement last year.

'With our partners at the Liberace Foundation we'll be able to stage a show so lifelike - the room will be filled with all of the great singer's charm and charisma.'

While the word 'hologram' is used, the shows more typically use reflections on glass with a technique called 'Pepper's Ghost', named after 19th century optics researcher John Pepper.

The technique projects an image onto stage by placing a piece of glass between the original image of the performer and the audience. With lighting, the image of the performer is then projected towards the audience.

In Tupac's case, the show did not use old footage but was created by CGI, which cost between $100,000 and $400,000, Gizmodo reported. 

At the Billboard Music Awards last May, the Jackson hologram performed Slave To The Rhythm, which is from his posthumous album Xscape, and it even moonwalked across the stage.

The performance, which lasted 14 minutes, had a reported cost of millions.

The show went ahead amid legal wrangling after the owner of Hologram USA insisted that his holographic technology was stolen by organizers Pulse Entertainment - which the company denied.
