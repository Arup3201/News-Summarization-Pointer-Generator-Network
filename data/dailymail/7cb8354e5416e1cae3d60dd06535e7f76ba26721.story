Police in New Hampshire have the released pictures of the clothing Abigail Hernandez was wearing Sunday when she mysteriously reappeared nine months after she disappeared, though they have failed to shed any light on the strange case.

The 15-year-old returned safely to her family after vanishing on the way home from school on October 9. Townspeople who searched and prayed that she would return are relieved but also looking for answers about where she's been and how she got home.

State Attorney General Joseph Foster said Abigail Hernandez was reunited with her family Sunday.

Authorities Tuesday released pictures of a striped sweater and black pants and a camouflage backpack, as well as a still from security footage showing the moment the teen returned to a train station this weekend.

So far, her return is cloaked in just as much mystery as her disappearance after she left Kennett High School in Conway.

The family has asked for privacy, but 
in a brief statement, Foster quoted Abigail's mother, Zenya Hernandez, 
as saying, 'today we are the happiest people on earth.'

'I'm
 glad to see she's home in one piece,' he said. 'Hopefully, her life 
gets back to normal, she goes back to school and everything's good.'

Police said Abigail left school at the normal time and walked the usual route toward her house that October day, sending several texts between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. But she never made it home.

Police revealed several months ago that she had written home to her mother.

When the letter surfaced, FBI agent Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility that Abigail, who turned 15 a week after disappearing, had run away but that someone could be coercing her into staying away.

Police have not revealed the contents of the letter.

Foster said the criminal investigation into Abigail's disappearance continues. After she vanished, police said they had no evidence to suggest anything suspicious and were treating her disappearance as a missing-person's case.

In Conway, rescuers fanned out for days over the heavily forested terrain that surrounds the town house where Hernandez lives with her mother. Police also searched by air, stopped traffic and handed out fliers, and used boats on the Saco River and Pudding Pond.

Investigators are now checking surveillance video from local businesses and asking residents if they saw Abigail or a woman wearing a striped sweater between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Sunday.

They said Tuesday that they, too, have many questions surrounding the disappearance and return of Hernandez.

When questioned over the months about the scope of the search, law enforcement said it was appropriate to try to recover a missing child.

Andrew Berg, 18, who works at a sporting goods store in North Conway, said he drove past a billboard bearing Abigail's picture and the word 'missing' on his way into Conway on Monday and lamented how discussion of her disappearance had 'blown over.'

'They I got a text from my mother saying, "Oh my God, Abby's home!"'

Berg's co-worker, Jameson Proko, said he has kept in his wallet a business card an FBI agent gave him ever since Abigail's disappearance.

'I want answers,' Proko said. 'The truth often clarifies a lot of things. And will prevent rumors.'

Downs remembers the effect the disappearance had on the community.

The thought that someone could snatch a child sent shudders down the spines of people in the northern New Hampshire town that relies heavily on family-oriented tourism.

'I don't know how much this cost the town but somebody should come clean about what happened,' he said of the heavy law enforcement effort.

'They didn't find her; she came home on her own, from what I know.'

Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teenager, has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing ten months ago

'I want to know where she was, where 
she's been for nine months,' Downs said. 'It should have been figured 
out. Everybody wants to know the truth.'

Police
 Chief Edward Wagner said the search cost his department more than 
$20,000, a third of his annual overtime budget, and that didn't include 
hours worked by ranking officers who don't get overtime.

At the school on Tuesday, Principal Neal Moylan pulled together summer school students to see how they were handling the news.

'These are young people who've gone through a whole range of emotions this past year,' Moylan said.

'Everybody
 wonders what's going on,' Moylan said. 'We're patient. We're going to 
stay out of the way and let the professionals do their job and when it's
 time for us to do our job, we'll be here.'

The family had received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her October 9 disappearance.

Authorities
 revealed few details about the letter at the time out of fear copycats could hamper
 the investigation and asked the family to do the same.

Investigators had given no updates as to whether the letter has produced any leads.

Mrs Hernandez told ABC in December that she believed her daughter was still alive.

She said: 'If Abby comes back, she won't be the ''missing girl''. We can get our lives back to normal.

'I
 would meet her anywhere she needs me to. She needs to know she is not 
in trouble with anyone. I just love her and want her home safe.'

Zenya Hernandez posted this heartbreaking letter begging her daughter to come for the holidays after she has been missing since October 9

Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya (pictured left) with the teenager's sister Sarah wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned

In a heartbreaking open letter with a
 little sketch of a Christmas tree, the distraught mother wrote: 'I 
thank God every day that you are alive!

'I miss hearing your voice and your sense of humor. Please let me know what I can do to help you.

'Please come home for Christmas.'

Earlier
 on December 12, she wrote on the family's site: 'I will ALWAYS love 
you. I will ALWAYS have hope. i will NEVER stop looking. Love, MOM.'

Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6.

Officials
 delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed
 in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager.

Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety.

One
 FBI investigator had suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to 
the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten 
years by Ariel Castro.

Authorities
 also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along 
with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the 
hope of jogging someone's memory.

The missing girl has no source of income, so someone was 
helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe,' police said at the time.

FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated.

Since
 her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public 
pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that 
they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is 
in serious trouble.

The last call
 made on a missing New Hampshire girlâ€™s cellphone was October 9 about 
four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

The
 last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and
 was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.
