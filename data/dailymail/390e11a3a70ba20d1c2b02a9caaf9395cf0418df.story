BT Sport have announced that they will be showing Bradford's FA Cup quarter-final clash against Reading for free after the BBC snubbed the League One club for a second time.

The last-eight tie will be played on Saturday March 7 and will be available for everyone to watch on btsport.com and on the Sky TV platform.

The BBC again rejected the opportunity to show Bradford live on TV despite coming in for criticism after they did not air the Bantams giant killing over Premier League opposition Sunderland.

Bradford vs Reading - March 7, 12:45 Kick-off live on BT Sport 1

Aston Villa v West Bromwich Albion - March 7, 17.30 kick-off live on BBC1

Liverpool v Blackburn Rovers - March 8, 16.00 kick-off live on BT Sport 1

Manchester United v Arsenal - March 9, 19.45 kick-off live on BBC1

Simon Green, head of BT Sport, said: 'The excitement of the FA Cup continues on BT Sport and we have two fantastic quarter-finals on the channel.

'This will be the second time that BT Sport have shown Bradford City in this year's FA Cup and because Bradford City Football Club have been very passionate about the UK seeing their amazing club run, BT Sport have decided to make the game against Reading available to everyone to watch, online, via BT TV and Sky.'

The BBC had first and third pick of the last-eight matches and understandably plumped for Manchester United's clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford as first choice.

BT Sport, who are sharing FA Cup coverage with the BBC, opted to show Liverpool against Blackburn as their first pick, and the BBC have ignored Bradford's match in favour of the Midlands derby between Aston Villa and West Brom.

The decision not to show Braford's fifth-round tie led to supporters chanting 'are you watching BBC?' and goalscorer Jon Stead even joked that the game 'should have been on TV' during his post-match interview, and the BBC risked further backlash by ignoring the club once more.

Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's win over Sunderland.

'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: "They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldnâ€™t be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it".'

The BBC's football editor later released a statement explaining how selections for FA Cup matches are made.

The TV match selections for the 5th round of the FA Cup caused a bit of a reaction yesterday, so I wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works. You still might not agree with our picks, particularly if you're from Bradford, but hopefully you'll see there's a bit of logic to what we try to do.

As Gary Lineker mentioned yesterday, the hardest thing is that both the BBC and BT have to make our selections before the outcome of replays. That's the only reason why Phil Parkinson's side didn't get a live match this time round. We had to weigh up the options and given Sunderland's recent form, thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being League One against a Championship side. In this case it wouldn't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live Quarter-Final, as Reading have done by progressing at Derby.

If Bradford definitely had a home tie against Premier League opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on BBC One. That has been a big part of our policy so far, showing AFC Wimbledon, Cambridge, Bristol City and tonight Preston, all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight.

As the game unfolded yesterday at Valley Parade, we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live. It's everything the FA Cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about. We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it's tricky for them. Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections. But we hope there's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday.

Of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight. We have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks. Warrington from the eighth tier overcoming Exeter City, Blyth Spartans winning in dramatic fashion at Hartlepool, AFC Wimbledon running Liverpool close and Cambridge holding Manchester United under the Abbey Stadium lights. It's also great to see the difference the TV money can make to these clubs, as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in.

Our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these David vs. Goliath matches and games involving Premier League sides. For those who can't afford subscription to sports channels, it's been great to be able to see live international stars like Alexis Sanchez, Angel Di Maria, Steven Gerrard, Ron Vlaar and Alex Song, all as part of the licence fee. While the Aston Villa vs. Leicester game wasn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a hotly contested Midlands derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million.

Of course, we would have loved to have been live at Chelsea in the 4th round and Bradford in the 5th, but the good news for fans is that even when a game isn't shown live there's always comprehensive Match of the Day highlights available. There's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the FA Cup on the BBC, with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it. After the 4th round, 26 million people had watched the coverage on the BBC, that's 8 million more than on terrestrial TV this time last season. It's not all about viewing figures and ratings, but it's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience.

Despite some of the criticism coming out of Bradford, a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick, and I hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the Premier League. I'm a Bristol Rovers fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite.

When we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the Quarter-Final we will take all I've discussed into consideration, but the good news is that all four matches will be live on TV. That means Bradford's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money-spinning Quarter-Final game and boy do Bantams fans deserve it!
