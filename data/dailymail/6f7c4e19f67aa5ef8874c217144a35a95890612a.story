Islamic State militants have seized a major Syrian air base, wiping out the last government stronghold in a province dominated by jihadists.

The extremists won a week-long battle today to capture the sprawling Tabqa base 25 miles from their stronghold in Raqqa, reportedly killing dozens of soldiers in the process.

The base was reportedly one of the military's largest  facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. 

Dubious celebration: Islamic State extremists smiled broadly and embraced today after they won a bloody battle to seize the Tabqa air base, the last surviving government outpost in Syria's Raqqa province

Damage: The capture followed several days of fighting between Islamic State militants and Syrian government forces. Pictured, A man inspects damage at the entrance of a Tabqa hospital after a government air strike

Its capture is a huge blow to President Assad's regime and will spark concern over the treatment of any survivors.

Militants beheaded Syrian soldiers and impaled their heads on fence posts when they captured similar bases, including the sprawling Division 17 base in Raqqa.

There were several failed efforts to breach the facility's walls in recent days but the facility was captured today, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Despite government airstrikes to try to beat back the attack, the jihadis quickly quashed the remaining pockets of resistance, killing dozens of soldiers.

Spies are close to identifying the hooded jihadist dubbed Jailer John who beheaded the journalist James Foley, Britain's ambassador to the U.S. revealed today.

'I can't say more than this but I know from my colleagues at home that we are close,' Peter Westmacott told CNN. 

'We're putting a lot into it and there are sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on which people can use to check who these people are'.

A 'significant force' of SAS soldiers and signallers have deployed to northern Iraq in the hunt for the extremists, who spoke with British accents and callously boasted of making personal fortunes from ransoms paid for other released hostages.

The gang openly talked of making so much money they could ‘retire to Kuwait or Qatar’, according to testimonies by former hostages obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

'Some of the Syrian regime troops pulled 
out and now the Islamic State is in full control of Tabqa,' said 
Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman.

'This makes Raqqa province the first to fully fall out of government hands.'

Another activist group, the Local Coordination Committees, also said the extremist group was in control.

The SANA state news agency confirmed that the government had lost the air base, saying troops 'are successfully reassembling after evacuating the airport.' 

Fighters have swept through a huge tract of northeastern Syria after seizing control of much of northern and western Iraq in June.

From their Syrian stronghold in Raqqa they have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of Sharia law.

It has opened up three fronts in the fighting in Syria, which is already home to a bloody and long-running civil war between President Assad's forces and anti-government rebels.

Islamist militants have fought soldiers from both sides of the previous conflict making large parts of the country unstable.

Key target: The extremists won a week-long battle to capture the sprawling Tabqa base 25 miles from their stronghold in Raqqa, reportedly killing dozens of soldiers in the process

Taking opponents at first by surprise and building a reputation for callous ruthlessness, militants have  overwhelmed outposts held by rival rebels in Deir el-Zour province, which borders Iraq,

But the have also systematically picked off isolated government bases in the northeast, decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen and putting their heads on display.

Last month Islamic State fighters overran the sprawling Division 17 military base in Raqqa, killing at least 85 soldiers.

Two weeks later, the extremists seized the nearby Brigade 93 base after days of heavy fighting.

 across Iraq killed at least 35 people on Saturday in apparent revenge 
attacks after Shi'ite militiamen machine-gunned a Sunni Muslim mosque in
 Diyala province on Friday, killing 68 worshippers and deepening the

The
 violence continued on Sunday, when a car bomb killed seven people in a 
mostly Shi'ite area of Baghdad, police and medical sources said.

government,' a spokesman said.

CCTV footage has emerged reportedly showing the moment five separate British jihadis strolled through the departure lounge of Gatwick Airport on their way to fight in Syria. 

They are all among more than 500 Britons who have enlisted with jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, prompting warnings of new terror laws from the Home Secretary. 

The Gatwick video, which emerged today, purports to show a group of five British jihadis from Portsmouth leaving the airport for Turkey early on October 8 last year.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, the men booked a return journey but instead used an intermediary to cross the border into Syria where they joined militants.

One of the men is said to be 31-year-old Mashadur Choudhury, who returned just weeks later and in May became the first Briton to be convicted of a terror offence in relation to the current conflict.

His 12-day trial at Kingston Crown Court saw social media evidence of him talking about dying a martyr's death and setting up a group called the al-Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys.

The trial also heard how he went on a spending spree with £35,000 which he had borrowed from his family, including a £17,000 Audi A6 and £200 prostitutes.

Toll: At least one of the men who is reportedly pictured in the footage has since been killed, said his father

Another of the men was reportedly fellow Portsmouth resident Muhammad Hamidur Rahman.

The 25-year-old was sacked from his job as a Primark store supervisor a month before he left for Syria last October.

His time as an Islamist fighter was short-lived, as his father said earlier this month that he had been killed during the conflict.

The ease with which the men left the country comes despite promises of new laws to crack down on British extremists by the Home Secretary Theresa May.

Yesterday she insisted authorities had already excluded more than 150 people from Britain.

But she was also widely mocked by Labour, a Muslim MP and outspoken Tory David Davis over proposed new laws to stop radical preachers when they were likened to 'Asbos for terrorists'.
