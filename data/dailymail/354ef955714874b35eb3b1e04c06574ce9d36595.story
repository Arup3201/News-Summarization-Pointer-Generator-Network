Eggs belonging to an ancient flying reptile that could grow to the size of a small aircraft have been discovered in China.

It is the first time eggs laid by a pterosaur have been found fully intact, and palaeontologists claim they could shed new light on a mysterious, previously unknown species.

The fossils were discovered in the Xinjiang Province, and suggest that at least some of the animals lived in large nesting colonies, much like modern birds.

Discovered: Palaeontologists have found eggs laid by a pterosaur for the first time and they say that the discovery could shed new light on the mysterious ancient reptiles

The previously unknown pterosaur species, Hamipterus tianshanensis, is thought to have had a wingspan of between five and 11 feet.

The Hamipterus eggs were not soft and leathery, such as those of most reptiles, nor were they hard like a bird’s. Instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane.

The modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg, according to the scientists.

A total of five intact fossil eggs were found at the site in Xinjiang Province in north west China, along with the bones of 40 adults.

They all belong to a previously unknown pterosaur species named Hamipterus tianshanensis, which had a wingspan of between 5ft (1.5 metres) and 11ft (3.4 metres).

Scientists believe the thin-shelled eggs, which show signs of cracking and crazing, were not part of the same clutch.

‘The combination of many pterosaurs and eggs indicates the presence of a nesting site nearby and suggests that this species developed gregarious behaviour,’ said lead researcher Dr Xiaolin Wang, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.

‘Hamipterus likely made its nesting grounds on the shores of freshwater lakes or rivers and buried its eggs in sand along the shore, preventing them from being desiccated.’

Previously the only pterosaur eggs known to science were four poorly preserved and flattened specimens, three of which were discovered in China, and one Argentina.

Based on skulls recovered, experts think that the ancient reptiles had head crests (illustrated) which differed in size and shape between the sexes

The Hamipterus eggs were not soft and leathery like those of most reptiles, nor were they hard like a bird’s.

Instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane, according to the study published in the journal Current Biology.

The modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg, the scientists explained.

‘We regard the eggshell structure found in Hamipterus as a general trend for pterosaurs,’ they said.

The pterosaurs are thought to have died in a large storm that hit their colony in the Turpan-Hami Basin, south of the Tian Shan Mountains, around 120 million years ago.

Male and female skulls were recovered as well as vertebrae and limbs. Both sexes of the reptile had head crests, but the males’ were larger and a different shape than the females’.

They palaeontologists said: ‘Sites like the one reported here provide further evidence regarding the behaviour and biology of this amazing group of flying reptiles that has no parallel in modern time.’

Pterosaurs are often confused with dinosaurs but belonged to a distinct reptilian group. Much less is known about them than the dinosaurs.

They were the first vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight and showed enormous diversity.

Species ranged from creatures the size of a sparrow to the monstrous Quetzalcoatlusa, which had a wingspan of 40ft (12 metres).

Towards the end of their time on Earth, only the larger species remained as the smaller ones were out-competed by early birds.
