There's bad news for the entire female cast of TOWIE.

When it comes to attracting men, less is more where makeup is concerned.

Almost three-quarters of British men say they prefer women to wear very little make-up - in the style of the Duchess of Cambridge rather than that of former TOWIE star Amy Childs - according to a poll.

Almost three-quarters of British men say 
they prefer women to wear very little make-up, in the style of the 
Duchess of Cambridge, right, rather than former TOWIE girl Amy Childs, left.

Although 93 per cent of men surveyed agreed a small amount of make-up could improve a woman's look, just a quarter (27 per cent) said they preferred the caked-on TOWIE image to the demure tones of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Female stars including Holly Willoughby, Amanda Holden, Fearne Cotton 
and Jools Oliver were highlighted as being particularly attractive in a 
natural way.

And Amy Childs, Lady Gaga, Tulisa and Carol Vorderman were deemed too heavily made-up by the majority of males polled.

Interestingly men from the south were found to be the biggest advocates of the subtle look, while northern males confessed to being more attracted to women who liked wearing substantial makeup.

Too much foundation was viewed as the biggest turn off, closely followed by streaky fake tan, ridiculous false lashes and tiger-like false nails.

Ironically, nearly half of the men polled (48 per cent) said they used beauty products including moisturiser, eye-rollers and teeth whitener in a bid to look their best for the ladies.

A spokesman from RoxyPalace, the online casiono that conducted the survey of 800 men, said the results may show men to be less cynical than first thought.

He said: 'Men are often accused of 
preferring women who apply bold, eye-catching make-up, yet what our poll
has found is that for most too much slap is a reason to take a step 
back.

'While nearly all 
agreed that applying a little makeup could help accentuate a woman's 
best features, the vast majority believed that less was more when it 
came to presentation â€“ which may be bad news for makeup manufacturers.'

Most men surveyed felt Lady Gaga, left, wears too much make up, and that the understated style of Jamie Oliver's wife Jools is more attractive

He concluded: 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and there is no right or wrong amount of make-up to wear, but if you're out on the pull, particularly in the south of England, you may wish to ditch the make-up in the hunt for the dream man.'

Natural? Pah! Looking this 'natural' takes just as long as looking 'unnatural', says Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon.

But what men think of as 'natural' actually takes a lot of effort, according to one make-up expert.

Lisa Potter-Dixon, Benefit's Head Makeup And Trend Artist, told MailOnline: 'So, boys, you may think my flawless skin and rosy cheeks were a gift from god....well, you are very, very wrong!

'The "natural" look takes just as long as the "unnatural look".

'You see, to get this face, we have prepped using a moisturiser, primed, using a primer and then perfected with a foundation, concealer, highlighter and powder!

'It's the precise and timely application of these products that creates our flawless looking skin. Then there's the blush.

'Getting this natural glow takes military application!

'It's all about the positioning of where you apply it; not too high, not too low. Not too round, not too angled!

'And did I mention that if you get your blusher wrong, you can't just rub it off, you have to take your entire face of make-up off and start again!

'I haven't even mentioned the monthly tinting, waxing and threading that our facial hair goes through to finish our looks. But that's another story!

'So boys, the truth is, being beautiful takes time. It's just a good job us girls have got it down to a tee.'
