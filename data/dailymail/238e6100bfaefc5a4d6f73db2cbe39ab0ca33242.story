Author Cheryl Strayed's best-selling travel memoir about her cathartic, 1,100-mile walk along the Pacific Crest Trail has become a literary phenomenon - but little did she imagine that the journey would bring her in touch with a sister she had never known.

In 1995, when she was 26 and a first-time hiker, Strayed spent three months on the arduous trail as she sought a way to come to terms with her mother's sudden death from cancer, her own battle with drugs and a painful divorce.

The experience gave Strayed the material to write the 2012 memoir Wild: A Journey From Lost to Found. The book became a New York Times bestseller and number one choice of the lucrative Oprah Winfrey Book Club.

Strayed, now a 44-year-old married mother-of-two in Portland, Oregon, has become a sounding board for many readers who have faced painful challenges in their own lives.

She receives hundreds of emails from those who have found solace in her words - but, the writer told NPR, one message leapt out from all the others.

One correspondent gave Strayed the startling news that she believed they had the same father.

Coincidence: The author was emailed by her half-sister after she picked up her book in the library by chance and realized they had the same father

The woman was in fact the author's half-sister and had only discovered the fact by chance.

She had been browsing the travel section at her local library when the cover of Wild - with its hiking boot on the cover -  had drawn her to pick it up and check it out. 

Later, just pages into the memoir at home, she realized her connection with the author. 

She recognized that Strayed was her half-sibling purely from the description of their father.

Strayed told NPR that in the past she had tried to track her sister down by searching on her name a few times online.

The author was aware that her half-sister knew her first name and that their father had another family with older children before she was born.

Neither Strayed nor her half-sister have relationships with their father.

Strayed told NPR that their bonding 
experience has been an interesting journey for both women but that they 
have yet to meet or speak on the phone.

The best-selling author told NPR: 'I think that the trick to 
writing a memoir and the trick to writing fiction is always to have this
 consciousness of what it really means to be human, and what the human 
experience is.

'And the human experience is full of serendipity and 
surprise and situations taking a turn that you didn't expect.'

Strayed's literary gold came when she found a way to deal with devastating situations in her own life.

In 1995, she embarked on the thousand-mile trek from the Mojave Desert in Nevada, through California and Oregon to Washington State, a feat that would have cowed even the most experienced hiker.

Her decision to carry out the dangerous trek followed several painful years. Strayed had lost her mother to cancer at the age of 22. Her marriage crumbled as she dissolved in grief and dabbled in drugs.

For weeks on end, she walked the trail in the same clothes, leaving herself bloodied, bruised and hungry but completed the journey with a new found sense of self.

Wild is expected to be turned into a movie after actress Reese Witherspoon bought the film rights to star as Strayed, while author Nick Hornby is adapting it for the big screen.
