A Park Avenue-raised heroin addict who went into labour while she was being handcuffed for allegedly keeping explosives in her upscale apartment has not seen her daughter since the birth, her friends have revealed.

Morgan Gliedman, 27, delivered a healthy, drug-free daughter named Melody Sunshine following the arrest at her Manhattan home last week, and the child is now being looked after by her parents.

On Tuesday, Gliedman was granted $150,000 bail and, wearing an ankle-monitoring bracelet, was taken to a mandatory 30-day treatment program, the New York Post reported.

The wealthy doctor's daughter emerged from Manhattan Criminal Court looking pale and disheveled - and with a small bump on show beneath her winter coat - after the judge granted her bail.

Last week, the well-to-do addict was charged with keeping high-powered explosives and illegal firearms in her 
Greenwich Village apartment, and was already a suspect in a robbery.

She lived at the home with the father of her child, Aaron Greene, 31, who is reportedly also an addict.

Inside the apartment, officers found 
seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the 
substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings.

The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive.

Police
also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting 
shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a 
replica of an M203 grenade launcher.

Several disturbing items were seized, 
including: 'The Terroristâ€™s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and 
Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself 
Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby 
traps and explosives.

Officers
were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and 
Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to 
their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported.

The
apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street is near the apartment where
two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb 
for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970.

Greene
and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are 
just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' 
according to the Daily Beast.

Friends revealed to the New York Post that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony weapons charges to his name.

She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing.

'She comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the Post.

They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free.

The newborn is now being cared for by
Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a broker, and father, Dr. 
Paul Gliedman, head of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Brooklyn.

When she is released from the treatment program, she will allowed to travel throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, said celebrity bail bondsman Ira Judelson, who posted Gliedman's bail.

'She wants to get clean. She wants to address this legal issue. She wants to raise her daughter,' he added.

Gliedman will be back in court on January 29 on the weapons charges and unrelated theft charges.

Following
the arrest, it emerged that the 27-year-old was already a suspect in a 
robbery - and already on probation for drug possession.

On February 17, Gliedman met a man at
Johnny's Bar in the Village and went to his Midtown apartment where she
allegedly took off with a backpack containing his laptop, cellphone, 
wallet and credit cards, which she used to make purchases.

Five days after the robbery, on 
February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, Greene, were 
arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle.

The
couple were spotted with another woman in a car and Greene was seen 
injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal 
complaint said.

Police 
officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital 
scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to 
The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun.

'I have a... rifle in the trunk,' he told officers, according to the complaint.

He was sentenced to five months in 
jail. Gliedman was due to complete pre-trial probation for drug 
possession this week, but that case now could be reopened because of the latest explosive find.

Greene's
father is the head of a top art restoration firm. He was also arrested 
in the apartment on Saturday and is being held without bail on Rikers 
Island.

Greene claims he went to Harvard University for his undergraduate degree and did graduate work at the Kennedy School of Government there.
