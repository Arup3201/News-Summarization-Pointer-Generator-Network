The Bolshoi ballet director partially blinded an acid attack has spoken of his determination to return to the stage 'as soon as' he can see again.

Sergei Filin appeared at a press conference at the German hospital where doctors are trying to save his eyesight, saying he is ‘full of strength and faith’ that he will work again.

The artistic director at the famous Moscow theater was attacked outside his home in January by a masked man who threw sulfuric acid in his face, leaving him with severe damage to his eyes and skin.

Attacked: Sergei Filin dries his eyes during the press conference at the university hospital in Aachen, Germany, as he speaks about his determination to return to the Bolshoi when his sight returns

Swathed in a scarf and hat to cover his burns, he sat next to his doctors at Aachen University Clinic as they said they remain hopeful Mr Filin would recover useful 
vision.

‘I am full of strength and faith that I will recover what has been unjustly taken from me,’ Mr Filin said.

He said he was not afraid of returning to the theater despite reports of murky rivalries at the ballet that might have been behind the attack.

Top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko is accused of masterminding the acid attack, and has admitted to a court that he ordered a physical attack on Mr Filin, but that he never 
expected the perpetrator to use acid.

Mr Dmitrichenko has been refused bail and will remain in custody until April 18 as the investigation is carried out.

An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Mr Filin.

Meanwhile doctors at Aachen University Clinic said one of Mr Filin's badly damaged eyes has already shown 
some improvement.

Dressed head to toe in black and 
wearing large dark glasses, Mr Filin sat 
quietly as doctors discussed his treatment, before addressing the audience.

He said he was in daily telephone contact with his 
deputy at the theater and had no fear about going back to 
work.

‘As soon as I can see, I will go back and do the same work. I am 
not afraid.’

Confession: Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko, pictured in court last week, has admitted to 'giving his blessing' to a physical attack on Filin but not that the perpetrator would use acid

Dr. Martin Hermel, an eye specialist, 
said that Mr Filin suffered damage to the surface and inner parts of both 
eyes and had undergone several surgeries.

He cautioned that Filin faces 
‘complex and long-term treatment’ that could take months rather than 
weeks.

Dr Hermel said that he held out hope that Filin would ‘recover useable vision’ to allow him to return to his professional duties.

While his
left eye had shown some improvement, Dr Hermel said his team 'cannot at this point make a 
statement about the prognosis for vision in this eye.'

The Bolshoi Theater's general director, Anatoly Iksanov, has accused veteran principal dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze of inciting tensions in the theater that led to the attack.

Tsiskaridze, a long-time fierce critic of Iksanov who is reported to aspire to his job, has rejected the allegation.
