A grandmother and two tiny children were car-jacked in a terrifying roadside robbery after three thieves climbed into their car and stole the vehicle.

The woman and her grandchildren - described as a baby boy and a three-year-old girl - had just pulled up at road work traffic lights when the trio of men, all dressed in black, pulled open the doors of the Vauxhall Astra.

The men then yanked out the car seats with the children still strapped in and dumped them and the youngsters on the roadside. 

A grandmother and two tiny children were car-jacked in a terrifying robbery on Farm Road (pictured), in Maidenhead, after three thieves climbed into their car and stole the vehicle

The 77-year-old woman was then ordered out of the car and all three men clambered in and sped off.

Just minutes earlier the same men had crashed another stolen car into a tree and had unsuccessfully tried to hijack a workman's van.

The drama happened in darkness in Maidenhead, Berkshire last night after the men arrived at a house in the town's Highway Avenue in a Skoda car they had earlier stolen in London.

Police said that they broke into a house in the road but were disturbed by the occupants and returned to the Skoda which then sped off.

However, the driver lost control as he tried to accelerate out of sight and crashed the car into a tree in nearby Birdwood Road.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that all three men abandoned the stolen Skoda and ran towards Farm Road in Maidenhead.

'The offenders then tried to steal a van but were chased off by workmen,' said the spokesman.

'A female driver was travelling along Farm Road, when she stopped briefly at a set of traffic lights next to roadworks.

'The three men entered the car and forced the occupants, the woman and the two young children she was with, to exit the vehicle with the children still in their car seats.

'The victim and the children were helped by people from nearby public house who took them in and called the police.'

Neither the grandmother nor the children - who all live in Maidenhead - were injured in the incident although the woman was said to have been very badly shaken by the experience.

The spokesman said that the three men were white and were dressed in black clothing.

'The car, a silver Astra, has not yet been located,' she added.

Investigating officer Detective constable Reese Williams from Maidenhead local CID said: 'The victims of these incidents, particularly the robbery, were obviously left very shaken by what happened to them last night.

'There would have been a lot of people in the area at this time and, although we have already spoken to a number of witnesses, we would like to hear from you if you were in the area and saw anything which may be connected.

'If you saw a silver Astra leaving the scene, or have located this car, then please contact us immediately,' he added.
