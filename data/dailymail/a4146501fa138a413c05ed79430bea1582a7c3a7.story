Harper Lee's biographer, who suggested the novelist had been coerced into releasing a To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, has changed his mind. 

Charles J Shields was among a throng of literary figures to suggest the reclusive 88-year-old may not have the capacity to make the decision herself. 

But today, after Lee released a statement to say she is 'happy as hell' about the release, Shields backed down.

However, doubts remain as a number of Lee's hometown friends maintain the novelist, who has been left blind after suffering a stroke, was 'manipulated'.   

'I'm happy as hell': Harper Lee's publisher has released a statement slamming claims she has been coerced into publishing Go Set A Watchman, the sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, 60 years after it was written

Explaining his u-turn, Shields told DailyMail.com: 'You know what, I've decided I'm happy as hell too now.

'I believe that statement was genuine and, really, this can only be a good thing for the industry.'

Shields initially said Lee was vulnerable to manipulation after her sister and lawyer, Alice Lee, died. 

Alice, who died in November 2014 at the age of 103, was 'Harper Lee's buffer against the publicity hungry world,' he told the International Business Times.

Today, however, he told DailyMail.com: 'I expressed concerns about the book, the process, and the fact that it is unedited.

'But this is good news for booksellers. I hope we will all be reading the same book this summer and I hope it is Go Set A Watchman. 

'At the end of the day, people are really looking forward to another story about Scout, and so am I.' 

Addressing his fellow critics, Shields said: 'I think the tide is turning.' 

Unaware? Harper Lee, pictured with Gregory Peck, who starred in the movie version of To Kill A Mockingbird, allegedly did not know the manuscript for her original version - Go Set A Watchman - survived 60 years

However, that sea change has yet to reach Monroeville, where Lee grew up.

Janet Sawyer, owner of the Courthouse Café and childhood friend of the Lee sisters, told AL.com: 'I don't think she agreed to do it. I think it's her attorney being greedy, because Ms. Lee was a very private person who didn't like a lot of publicity.

'She had a stroke several years ago and her mind is not in a condition to make these decisions, I don't think, personally. 

'Tonja Carter [Lee's attorney] doesn't allow her to see her friends anymore. She's isolated her from the world in order to manipulate her.' 

Lee previously said she had not realized the manuscript of her new book had survived and that she was 'humbled and amazed' it was going to be published now.

Best-seller: After the publication of To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee did not publish again

Adding to the outcry, Marja Mills, a friend of the Lee family and author of a Harper Lee memoir, told the New York Times: 'I have some concerns about statements that have been attributed to her.'

She said  Alice Lee, told her that Harper 'can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.'

Furthermore, publisher Jonathan Burnham acknowledged that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with Harper Lee, but communicated through her Monroeville attorney, Tonja Carter, and literary agent Andrew Nurnburg. 

However, slamming the allegations of coercion, a spokesman for the publishing house claims Lee said: 'I'm alive and kicking and happy as hell with the reactions to Watchman.'

The novel, called Go Set A Watchman, was written before To Kill A Mockingbird but was rejected by publishers who set her to work on the novel that made her famous. 

To Kill A Mockingbird, set around a rape trial in the racially-divided Deep South of the US, has sold more than 40 million copies since it was published in 1960. 

Its central characters, Scout, her brother Jem and their lawyer father Atticus, were brought to life in a 1962 film starring Gregory Peck.

The new book revolves around the now-adult Scout's return to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father.

A spokesman for her publisher said: 'Harper Lee still enjoys reading and uses a magnifying machine from the New York Institute for the Blind to read books, newspapers and documents.' 

Go Set A Watchman will be published on July 14 by William Heinemann, which was the original UK publisher of To Kill A Mockingbird.

The publisher says Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.

Burnham said during a telephone interview that he had known both Carter and Nurnburg for years and was 'completely confident' Lee was fully involved in the decision to release the book.

'We've had a great deal of communication with Andrew and Tonja,' said Burnham, adding that Nurnburg had met with her recently and found her 'feisty and in very fine spirits.
