There’s not much glamour for Rebecca Hall’s character Dr Maya Hansen in Iron Man 3.

So it’s no surprise that British actress decided to pull out all the stops on the fashion front for the premiere on her home turf on Thursday evening.

The 30-year-old pulled off a tricky plunging jumpsuit and managed to remain looking the picture of elegance despite offering waiting fans a cheeky glimpse of side-boob.

Glamour: Rebecca Hall looks incredible in a black jumpsuit at the Iron Man 3 premiere in London on Thursday evening

Rebecca, who is often conservative when it comes to dressing, made the most of the slightly warmer weather with the racy outfit.

While from the front the her breasts were concealed by the pieces of fabric when she turned to the side a large amount could be seen.

She accessorised with a pair of strappy black heels and a small black clutch bag with a wood detailing on it.

Plunging: Although the jumpsuit was as low-cut as her navel Rebecca still managed to look sophisticated

Making sure the stunning piece of clothing took centre stage she wore her hair sleeked off her face in a low bun.

Her beautiful look was completed with a dash of red lipstick which helped turn her into a vampy screen siren and the final touch came from beautiful earrings and a ring from De Beers.

Rebecca didn’t need to worry about anyone stealing her thunder as Gwyneth Paltrow chose to forgo the premiere, despite attending many others around the world.

Instead, the actress made an appearance at the star-studded Tiffany and Co. Blue Book Ball in New York.

No wonder they want a picture! Both photographers and fans couldn't get enough of the actress on the red carpet

Rebecca is a new addition to the popular franchise and staying true to her roots, she confirmed that her character is a ‘strong female character.’

Speaking about taking part in the film, she said: ‘I decided to do Iron Man 3 because I've never done the 'hurry up and wait' movie before. 

‘Even the studio movies I've done have been small studio movies, or indie films that we made on a wing and a prayer.

her role, she revealed that her character has a flashback scene to where
 she first met Tony Stark in 1993.

The scene in question takes place on 
New Year's Eve in a hotel room with Tony Stark and Happy Hogan  but it

The latest installment in the Iron Man franchise will see Gwyneth's character Pepper step out of the boardroom and into heavy action to help her love fight a formidable nemesis called the Mandarin.

The film, which also stars Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce and Stephanie Szostak is set after the events that occurred in The Avengers.

10 Rings that grant him immense power. At the beginning of the movie, he
 launches an attack at the Stark Expo where Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's 
bodyguard, is injured.

Meanwhile, the US Government is 
receiving evidence of people disappearing. Using his computer tracking 
equipment, Stark realizes that the Mandarin has been kidnapping citizens
 of the US and turning them into super soldiers with the new Extremis 
Virus.

spend to go to see at a theatre,' he said.

The premiere was forced to be delayed due to the Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday.
