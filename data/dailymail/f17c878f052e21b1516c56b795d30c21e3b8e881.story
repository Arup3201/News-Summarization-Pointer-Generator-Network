Rafael Nadal jinked and jumped around Centre Court, his fist shaking in relief. He had been rocked by the sheer ferocity of a Czech beast called Lukas Rosol but now he was being applauded by a crowd on its feet, a champion restored.

For a few nervous, late-lunchtime moments it looked as if history might just repeat itself. It was Rosol, tall and strong, who had caused an earthquake around this part of south-west London two years ago when his powerful serve and bold shots sent Nadal out in the second round.

Wimbledon had rarely witnessed a bigger shock, a 33-minute final-set dismantling under the roof by the then world No 100 of the great Rafa.

The Centre Court auditorium can make men shrivel or make them grow like giants, and we wondered for a set and a half on Thursday whether the air — the roof was down this time — might inspire Rosol again.

Now ranked 52nd in the world, Rosol took the first set and carried the momentum into the second, when he broke Nadal early and took a 4-2 lead.

The Spaniard was wobbling (as well as twitching and towelling and tarrying, to Rosol’s displeasure, as the Czech made clear on court with the odd disapproving stare and afterwards in his claim that Nadal is given special treatment by officialdom).

Would Rosol’s feat of 2012 play tricks with the minds of the players? After all, it was the biggest moment in one man’s career and presaged a long downturn in the fortunes of the other.

There was the murmur that rustles around the court at such moments of tension. But Nadal’s forehand, whippy and powerful and trusty, combined with his warrior spirit to fight back to 4-4. The set went to a tiebreak, which the double Wimbledon champion won 8-6.

We did not know it for certain yet but the outcome of the match was swinging Nadal’s way here and now. His uncle and coach, Toni, grasped some of the significance of it, though, and celebrated animatedly. Pippa Middleton, whose derriere graced a seat in the second row of the Royal Box, contented herself with a more regal clap.

Rosol’s first serve — an Exocet missile — was less reliable in the third set, his confidence dwindling as Nadal’s grew.  The one slight black mark against the match was the speed of Nadal’s play, about which Rosol made a few reasonable points.

‘All the players should have the same time between points,’ he said. ‘The best players are taking more than the normal players and nobody is telling them anything. I don’t know why.’

Most observers thought he was lumping Nadal and Novak Djokovic together as Alphas who please themselves.

Rosol added: ‘He was taking a long time between serves. He was doing all his rituals. I just asked the referee if it was OK and he said it was fine. This is not why I lost today, but the referee was not going with the rules.’

Nadal was unconcerned about the issue, happy just to have come through a tough match. Revenge was not in his vocabulary.

VIDEO Wimbledon: Day 4 review

John Isner reached the third round of the Championships for the first time.

The American No 9 seed, who is famous here for his 70-68 fifth-set win over Nicolas Mahut in 2010 — the longest match to ever be played  at Wimbledon — defeated Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen in straight sets.

Isner did show his love of long sets though, taking the opening set tie-break 19-17, the  second longest tie-break in  the history of the men’s competition.

‘What happened happened,’ he said of his defeat in 2012. ‘That’s it. We had already congratulated him for that. Today (Thursday) is another story. I need to find the solution. Finally, I did.

‘I had a good answer after being in a bit of trouble.

‘I played with fantastic energy in the last three sets. Very positive. Very quick with my legs. Very quick mentally. I was returning well. So I am very pleased with the way I played.

'After winning at Roland Garros I feel less pressure this year. I am more confident and better physically. I am practising with a different energy from the last two years because my knees work better.’

Next up is
 Mikhail Kukushkin, the Kazakh ranked 63 in the world and now playing 
freely after a shoulder injury. Ahead of that match, Nadal went back to 
his house to put his feet up, watch the USA vs Germany World Cup game 
and get some supper.

‘We go to restaurants every single day of the rest of the year so when we are here I like to cook,’ he said.

The world number one maintained his momentum to break to love in the first game of set four, soon surging 3-1 up.

After saving a break chance when serving for the match, Nadal eventually claimed victory at the third time of asking when Rosol's return was long.

Next for him will be Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in round three after he beat lucky loser Frank Dancevic in straight sets.
