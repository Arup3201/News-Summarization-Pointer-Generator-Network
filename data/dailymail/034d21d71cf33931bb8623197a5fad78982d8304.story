A family claim their home has been left looking 'like war-torn Syria' after a can of hairspray that was left next to a hot hairdryer exploded and a fire ripped through their house.

Kristel George, 35, left the appliance in a wicker basket just after using it and went downstairs to make breakfast for her sons Patrick, 12, and five-year-old Edenn.

The mother-of-two heard a massive bang, and rushed upstairs where she was met with a wall of flames.

A family say their home has been left looking 'like war-torn Syria' after a can of hairspray that was left next to a hot hairdryer exploded and a fire ripped through their house.  Kristel George and her son Edenn, five, outside their fire damaged home

After trying to tackle the fire with two buckets of water Ms George grabbed her children and their five-month-old bulldog George and ran from the rented terraced house in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire.

Seconds after she fled the force of the blaze blew the window out of the front bedroom. 

Ms George who is studying access to social sciences at Nottingham Central College, said the blaze left her home looking like 'war-torn Syria'.

She added: 'I was getting the kids ready for school and I had turned the hairdryer off.

'But there was a can of hairspray in the basket it was in so that caused the explosion.

'As I walked out of the door, the window went bang and exploded.

Charred possessions, including a cabinet and wicker basket, could be seen scattered outside the home after the blaze over the weekend

'If I'd gone back in the room I would have gone up with it. It was terrifying how close I was to being in the middle of that fire.

'People have said to me 'at the end of the day you and the kids are alive - you can replace everything else'.

'It did make me think though, how many women have got these hairdryers?

'I'm still in shock now. I've lost everything, all my children's keepsakes, photos, letters and Mother's Day presents were in my room.

'All the kid's clothes was black so we had to throw it out as well.

'The bedroom is completely wrecked, if you are standing in my room it looks like you're in war-torn Syria.

'The upstairs is completely black and downstairs is wet everywhere, it is just ruined.'

The fire quickly spread, destroying the bedroom and the furniture inside and blew out a top floor window 

Ms George, who moved into the rented property last month, has now been forced into temporary accommodation with her young sons, one of whom has mild cerebral palsy

Firefighters believe the blaze was sparked by the £20 Braun hairdryer which was left in a wicker basket next to a can of hairspray.

The fire quickly spread, destroying the bedroom and the furniture inside and blew out a top floor window.

Charred possessions, including a cabinet and wicker basket, could be seen scattered outside the home after the blaze over the weekend.

Ms George, who moved into the rented property last month, has now been forced into temporary accommodation with her young sons, one of whom has mild cerebral palsy.

She added: 'When I went back to the house it hit me, I think I have been in shock.

'I have only been renting the house for five months but I think it is going to take some time to repair.

'Luckily the landlord was okay about it. I would like to go back there but I just want to find a new home for the boys as quickly as possible.'

Her son Patrick said: 'I'm feeling okay but I'm a bit sad about the house. I'm just glad we got out.'

Watch manager Paul Meadows, of Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The bedroom is totally gutted - part of the ceiling is damaged and the floorboards, as well as the hallway.

'There's smoke damage to the rest of the house and downstairs is damaged by water we used.'
