After the cull of judges and presenters from the X Factor USA, it's hardly surprising that Simon Cowell wants a world-class diva sitting on that panel this year.

But even he might have set his sights somewhat high after it was reported that the music mogul is after Mariah Carey.

Cowell is believed to be trying to convince the singer to be one of the judges on the second series of the show after she was unable to take part last year having just given birth to her twins.

In high demand: Simon Cowell, seen here arriving at the Britain's Got Talent auditions in Manchester last week,  has set his sights on Mariah Carey to join the new judging panel on the next series of X Factor USA

A source told The Mirror: 'Simon wants nothing but the best for the X Factor - and Mariah is the best.'

But her husband Nick Cannon is believed to not be very keen on the idea and indicated that she will turn down the role.

He is reported as saying: 'Why would my wife want to be on a show like that? For somebody who has a legendary career, I don't know why they would.'

Yesterday it was revealed that Nicole Scherzinger and host Steve Jones have been unceremoniously dumped from the X Factor USA after just one season.

Reports today have suggested that Katy 
Perry and Nicki Minaj are also in Cowell's sights to join Mariah on the 
panel for the new series - and Dermot O'Leary, who presents the Uk 
version, has an outside chance of taking over from Steve Jones.

Cowell also recently admitted that despite axing her from the show last May, he would take Cheryl Cole back on board.

He
said: 'I regret what happened because Cheryl was a close friend. I've 
always believed we'll end up doing something together again.'

Humble pie: Simon said he regretted sacking Cheryl Cole from last year's show and she would be very welcome to come back this year

'She could be a panellist again if she wanted to - 100 per cent. I don't know if she would. I think she probably misses me.'

His former darling Paula Abdul confirmed yesterday she had also been fired from the panel in a desperate shake-up by the mogul and the show's producers.

'Yes, it’s true; I won’t be returning to The X Factor next season,' Abdul said in a statement today.

'I’ve learned through my longevity in this industry that business decisions often times override personal considerations.

She continued: 'Simon is, and will 
remain a dear friend of mine and I’ve treasured my experience working 
this past season. I want nothing more than for The X Factor to exceed 
ALL of their wildest dreams. This truly has been a blessing and I am 
most grateful.'

Cowell, who first worked with Abdul on 
American Idol, wants to re-boot the show after its ratings fell short of
expectations when it was launched last year. 

The decision to dismiss Abdul has surprised many, given how hard Cowell worked to secure her on the panel.

 'I want to say a massive thank you to Paula, Nicole and Steve for being part of The X Factor last year.

'We had a lot of fun making the show together and importantly, we found some real talent and stars.

'You do develop friendships with the people you work with and Paula, in particular, is a very close friend and I expect to be working with her on another project in the near future.

'I'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year.'

It took several months for her contract to negotiated and she only closed her deal hours before the first televised audition.

'You just have to get that chemistry, and she’s right,' he said at the time. 'I’ve never found anyone better than her.'

Both Abdul and Scherzinger were 
embroiled in the controversy surrounding the shock elimination of 
13-year-old frontrunner Rachel Crow.

Cowell hinted at a major changes on the show last month when he was 
quoted as saying: 'We change these shows all the time.' 

And he said in a statement today: 'I want to say a massive thank you to Paula, Nicole and Steve for being part of The X Factor last year.  I'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year.'

Although the X Factor performed solidly 
in the ratings, hovering around the 12 million mark, it did not attract the same kind of huge viewing figures
regularly attained by Cowell's former show American Idol.

Cowell had also recently 
admitted that that he may have been overconfident when it came to the 
American version of his hit show, after ratings did not reach his 20 million prediction.

He said he became ‘a bit too cocky' last year and admitted the slumping viewing figures had 'put my ego in check'.

Record executive L.A. Reid, who has previously worked with Mariah Carey, Pink, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, survived the cut.
