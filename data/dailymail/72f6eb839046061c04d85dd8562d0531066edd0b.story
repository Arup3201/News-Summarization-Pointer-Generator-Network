Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has expressed delight at regaining his fitness and revealed he is eager to make up for lost time and form a partnership with Alexis Sanchez.

Walcott was handed his first start of the season as the Gunners beat Hull 2-0 in their FA Cup clash courtesy of goals from Per Mertesacker and former Barcelona star Sanchez.

The 25-year-old has been watching his new team-mate from the sideline this season and admitted he was pleased to finally link up with him on the pitch.

'He's a special player,' Walcott told the BBC. 'It's great to finally get on the pitch with him and I'm sure there's going to be a lot more appearances of me and him together.

'It's amazing (to be back). It's been a year now, it was good to blow cobwebs away. I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. It was nice to get a start and as long as I'm getting in those chances I'm pleased.'

The England forward is no stranger to lengthy spells out injured and stressed the separation from his team-mates was the most difficult aspect. 

He said: 'Mentally the main target is to see how you can cope with your team-mates going out to training and your the only one in the rehab room its difficult like that but I had a lot of personal things in my life that took my mind off it.' 

Manager Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, was pleased with Walcott's return, even if he didn't convert the chances presented to him. 

He said: 'There were some positive signs - you could see he has not lost the timing of his runs. It will come.'
