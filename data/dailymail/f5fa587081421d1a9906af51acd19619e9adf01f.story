Tragedy: Police searching for Dylan Cecil, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, have found a body in the sea at Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset

The parents of four-year-old Dylan Cecil today said they were 'completely elated' after police searching for the boy found a body.

Rachel McCollum, 27, and Darren Cecil, 30, said the discovery would bring them 'closure' after days of looking for their son, who slipped into the sea off a jetty while on holiday with his family in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset.

The body was discovered at 12.30pm today under a floating jetty at the mouth of the River Brue, near Burnham-on-Sea Yacht Club - half a mile from where Dylan went missing.

Ms McCollum said: 'As daft as it seems we feel elated - completely elated. We've got our boy back and he's not out there anymore - he's not lost at sea.

'We can put a closure on it now, move on and carry on with what we need to do.

'I know I look like I'm smiling but inside I am devastated.'

Mr Cecil said: 'The thing we were worried about was him never coming back. Now we've found him we can get closure.

'Hopefully, we can get to see him again one last time.'

Dylan was dragged beneath the waves after toppling off a slipway in the resort at 6pm on Sunday evening.

Superintendent Keith McCoubrey, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'I can confirm today at approximately 12.30pm we recovered the body of a small boy from the banks of the estuary.

'Although there has been no formal identification as yet, we strongly believe it to be the body of Dylan Cecil - the little four-year-old boy who was tragically lost on Sunday.

'Dylan's parents have been informed 
and asked me to pass on their sincere gratitude to all members of the 
local community for their services since Sunday night.

'In particular they would like to 
pass on thanks to all members of the search and rescue teams involved in
the search for Dylan since Sunday.

'I'm sure you will understand that 
his parents are still extremely upset by what has gone on - but they are
very grateful to have Dylan's body returned to them.'

The body was found at the high tide mark on the mudflats by a member of the public who wanted to remain anonymous, police said.

Following the discovery of the body, 
Dylan’s family said in a statement: 'We would like to thank everyone for
their help and support during this difficult time.

'We would like to express our 
gratitude for all the messages of sympathy and support from both the 
local community and wider public across the nation.

'In particular we would like to thank
the people involved in the search - the police, RNLI, HM Coastguard and
the Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat (BARB). We are still extremely 
traumatised but very grateful that it appears Dylan has been returned to allow us to bury our son.'

Ms McCollum and Mr Cecil were at the scene this afternoon and laid flowers at a sea wall after learning of the body's discovery.

Dylan’s grandfather David Cecil said 
he felt an 'immeasurable' sense of relief that it appeared his 
grandson's body had been found.

Fighting back tears as a group of a

relief I am feeling right now.

'People asked me whether I was sad 
and I said no. I was sad on Sunday. Now I’m happy. It sounds strange but
we just wanted him back.

'I’m so relieved, I’m no longer in limbo. All I wanted was a body and now I’ve got that.

'I just wanted to bury him, we can do that now - our sense of relief is immeasurable.'

Dylan's maternal grandparents, David and 
Jackie McCollum, visited the place where his body was found and quietly 
placed a rose on the ground.

They remained at the scene for a few minutes before walking away without comment.

The family later issued a statement, 
which read: 'We would like to thank everyone for their help and support 
during this difficult time.

'We would like to express our 
gratitude for all the messages of sympathy and support from both the 
local community and wider public across the nation.

'In particular we would like to thank

and the Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat (BARB).

'We are still extremely traumatised but very grateful that it appears Dylan has been returned to allow us to bury our son.'

Dylan, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, was visiting his grandparents with Ms McCollum, Mr Cecil, and two younger sisters, aged one and three.

He had wanted to get a closer look at the sea when he slipped off the side of the jetty and disappeared beneath the water.

His
parents desperately tried to rescue him, but were unable to reach their
son and had to be pulled from the water by passers-by.

The
Coastguard and police launched a large search and rescue operation 
after a member of the public saw Dylan's parents attempting to rescue 
him.

The search for Dylan, 
who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, was called off at 4.30pm on Monday
but volunteers have continued to look for him to bring closure to his 
family.

Pete Shipley, a friend of Dylan's family, said: 'From what I have heard it was someone with binoculars that saw him.

'It was all over within five minutes. Police and ambulances screamed down here and then left very quickly.

'I'm just relieved he has been found. At last they can put him to rest.'

A
friend of the family, who did not wish to be named, said Ms McCollum 
had slept for just four hours in the last three days and had only eaten 
her first proper meal on Wednesday.

Yesterday the UK underwater rescue 
organisation SARbot used specialist sonar equipment to scour the water 
for Dylan's body but was unable to find him.

Dylan's family have remained in Burnham-on-Sea since Sunday and have been updated about the recovery operation.

Ms
McCollum told the BBC: 'He (Dylan) was literally not even a metre away 
from me and he was jumping and slipped and I watched him fall in.

'I jumped in straight after him - what more could I do? He went. I knew as soon as I jumped in I was not getting him back.'

A police and RAF helicopter were also 
involved in the search and rescue operation and further teams were 
helping with the frantic hunt at first light

She thanked everyone who had searched
for his body and implored people not to give up looking for her 
'gorgeous' and 'bubbly' little boy.

'I just want my son back,' she added.

The water off Burnham-on-Sea has one 
of the highest tidal rise and fall ranges in the world and the shoreline
is notorious for its dangerous mudflats.

The local authority, Sedgemoor 
District Council, said it was satisfied all its procedures were followed
correctly and there are many warning signs along the beach, esplanade 
and on the jetty hut.

But it said it is also carrying out an internal review 'to establish all relevant information'.
