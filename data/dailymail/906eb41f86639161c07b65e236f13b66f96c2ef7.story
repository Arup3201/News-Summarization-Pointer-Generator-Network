Campaigners fighting for a French-owned beach to be reopened to the public have held a protest picnic in a bid to reclaim part of their beloved coastline.

Around 300 people stormed the fence surrounding West Beach at Newhaven in Sussex today, which has been sealed off since 2007 because of 'absurd' health and safety.

The group gathered as the low tide made way for the sand, before useing ladders to climb over the barricade. They then ran onto the beach to spread out Union Jack flags and write messages in the sand, including: 'Give us our surf beach back.'

People young and hold who jumped the fence even scratched out messages in the sand with sticks

The stretch of coast has been the subject of a ongoing legal battle with the French-controlled company Newhaven Port and Properties who claim it is not a sandy beach 

The Court of Appeal has ruled the beach can be listed as a village green, giving residents the right to use it. 

But the French owners Newhaven Port and Properties is appealing against the ruling to the Supreme Court, and has said the beach remains closed for safety reasons. A final decision is set to be made during a hearing in November.  

Helen McLean, who runs the Facebook page We Love Newhaven and organises the annual demonstration, told Mail Online: 'This is the only sandy beach for miles. The South East coast is actually known for its hard, pebbly beaches.

'People still look to buy a house down here just because of the sandy beach, even though it is closed off.

The locals stretch a Union Jack out across the French-owned beach as part of the annual protest 

'We initially told the council that the stairs, which have been there since around 1860, were rickety. They shut the beach and we thought they were doing maintenance, but it has remained closed ever since.

'It is a clean beach, because the tide completely covers it twice a day, and British families have been enjoying it for generations.' 

Newhaven Village Green Preservation Society organised the picnic - which included entertainment, banners and bunting.

The group said campaigners young and old covered the gates to scale the barriers to retake the beach. 

In recent years, the gates have been vandalised, allowing residents to use the beach, but the action has not prompted the French firm to change their mind.  

Police were at the scene casting a 'passing eye' on the demonstrator's behaviour, but no arrests were made  

Objects were passed through the gaps in the barricade while others used ladders to jump over the top 

Even children were carried over the metal fence to join in the picnic at the once-popular tourist beach - which has been used by British residents for around 150 years
