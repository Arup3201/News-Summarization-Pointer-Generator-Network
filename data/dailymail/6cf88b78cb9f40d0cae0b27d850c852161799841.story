With abandoned beds, decaying equipment and graffiti strewn across the walls, these are the chilling images inside a deserted mental asylum where patients were subjected to electric shocks and lobotomies.

The Forest Haven asylum in Laurel, Maryland was renowned for its abuse of patients and was closed down in 1991.

When it opened in 1925, it was used as a children's development centre as well as a mental institution.

Inside the abandoned Forest Haven Asylum in Laurel, Maryland which was closed down in 1991 after allegations of abuse of patients 

A medical chair lies abandoned in the corner of a room at the asylum, where treatment included electric shocks and lobotomies 

At one time this room would have been full with patients receiving treatment, but now it is abandoned and the beds have been left to decay 

A broken cot lies in a doorway of the abandoned asylum. The facility is often considered as one of the top 10 most haunted locations in Maryland 

A children's cot stands next to a wall with the words 'lost souls' daubed on it in graffiti. When the facility opened, it was also a children's development centre as well as a mental institution 

The asylum faced a number of lawsuits before it was closed down in 1991, leaving all of the equipment inside, including this medical chair 

No only was furniture and equipment left abandoned, medication including test tubes were also left in among the rubble inside 

Some of the abuse that is said to have occurred at the facility included electric shock therapy, hydrotherapy and lobotomies.

It faced a number of lawsuits before closing and is regularly rated as one of the top 10 haunted locations in Maryland.

The facility also had its own cemetery and from 1928 to 1982, patients who died at the there would be buried in an unmarked grave in the grounds. 

The facility offered treatment to a wide range of patients suffering from mental health problems. Pictured are some of the broken sit in showers which still remain in the asylum 

Photographer Darryl Morgan who captured these images after recently visiting the asylum described the buildings as a 'crumbling time capsule' 

The facility also had its own cemetery and from 1928 to 1982 to bury patients who died there. Pictured is one of the former common rooms, which is filled with old, decaying furniture 

Not only were furniture and equipment left behind in the asylum, patients were also moved out to different facilities quickly, meaning some of their belonging were left behind 

The chapel inside the asylum, which has now been left to ruin and has graffiti strewn across the pews and mould coming out of the floor tiles  

Photographer Darryl Morgan visited the 22-building centre recently to see what it looked like inside.

And when the 49-year-old entered the facility, he was greeted with rotting equipment and abandoned personal belongings.

He explained: 'The place was surreal - like a crumbling time capsule.

The mental institution was spread out over 22 buildings in the town of Laurel, Maryland in the U.S. housing many patients 

Abandoned tables and chairs are left in the asylum's courtyard, where patients would have been taken to get fresh air 

Since closing almost 24 years ago, the entrance to the facility has almost been blocked by rubble and growing trees and plants 

'It was a rare look into the dark past of mental health care.

'This asylum had an extra creep factor because everything was left behind from when the doors closed for the last time.

'I'll never for the state of decay - seeing patient records and their personal belongings left in exactly the same place all those years ago.'
