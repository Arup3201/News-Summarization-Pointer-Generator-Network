Chunky men everywhere will be delighted to hear that British women have redefined the classic 'hunk', with recent research revealing they prefer their men 'real' - with a little more wobble than muscle.

Now Amanda Holden is heading up a campaign to find the UK's tastiest real-life hunk - and, if the research is to be believed, they might not be your stereotypical Adonis.

The study reveals that one in five UK women actively lust after cuddly men with a little extra padding around the middle. In fact, contrary to popular belief, just 10 per cent of women like their men broad and muscular.

Clean shaven and muscly isn't most British women's cup of tea - one in five likes extra padding

As well as cuddly love handles, more than third of women (33 per cent) prefer men with hairy chests.

And less than 10 per cent of British women like the clean-shaven look.

Four in ten devoted ladies said their own man possesses the ideal body.

Yoghurt brand Oykos worked with psychologists to measure the fluttering heart rates and clammy palms of women when shown a variety of hunky male body types.

Dr Simon Moore, Chartered Psychologist says: 'Body types traditionally viewed as "ideal" rated more attractive for short-term relationships.

But the research revealed that men with cuddly bodies rated most attractive to women seeking long-term relationships, due to their perceived 'humour, intelligence, honesty and kind-nature.'

Having
 searched the country high and low for special people on Britain's Got Talent, Amanda 
Holden now partners with Oykos to judge the real-life hunk competition. It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it, eh Amanda?

Slightly surreally, Oykos plan to immortalise winners as 
dessert spoon sculptures.

Amanda
 Holden says: 'I'm used to looking for talent, but searching the nation 
for hunks is a whole new ballgame! I need you, the women of the UK, to 
nominate your man, whatever his shape or size!

'And I’ll turn his torso 
into a tasty spoon, so you can dunk your hunk whenever you fancy!'

An Oykos spokesperson said: 'It’s wonderful to see women across the UK are redefining ’hunk’ as real-life men at home, not just the celebrities and models we so often see in the media.

'It’s great that 40 per cent of women believe their man represents their ideal body type and we would like to encourage women to celebrate their hunks at home by nominating them to be immortalised as a delicious dessert spoon.'
