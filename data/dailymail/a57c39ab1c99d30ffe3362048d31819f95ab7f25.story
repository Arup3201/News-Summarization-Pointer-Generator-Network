A former showjumper is lucky to be alive after she was brutally attacked with an ice skate, leaving fragments of skull in her brain.

Jemma Fitzgerald, 20, was left with blood gushing out of her head after being hit with the blade while walking alone in Shotton, near Chester.

Her injuries were so severe she was immediately transferred from the Countess of Chester Hospital to the intensive care unit at Walton Centre in Liverpool, a hospital specialising in brain injuries, where surgeons had to remove fragments of her skull from her brain.

Jemma said she had been out walking alone one evening when the attack came 'completely out of the blue'

Two weeks on from her ordeal, doctors have told Ms Fitzgerald they are unsure if she will ever fully recover from her injuries.

Ms Fitzgerald said: 'I was on my way to meet some people about a charity event for Cancer Research when I was hit in the head with an ice skate completely out of the blue. I actually didn't feel anything and only realised what had happened when I felt blood running down my face.

'I wasn't really sure what to do and didn't realise how serious it was at the time, to be honest.'

She paid tribute to a teenage boy and his dad who helped her after the attack until an ambulance and police arrived.

Jemma shows her deep scars and says she has no memory of the trip to the hospital after being bludgeoned

Ms Fitzgerald says she has no memory of her trip to hospital and it was only the next day that she learned just how serious her injuries were.

She said: 'Apparently I was in intensive care up until my operation where doctors found I had a depressed skull and fragments of bone in my brain which they had to remove. The surgeon told me that realistically I shouldn't be alive.'

The former showjumper and steeplechase rider is still struggling to carry out everyday tasks and fears she may never ride a horse again.

'I'm suffering from memory loss and have difficulty speaking as the words just sometimes won't come. I've also been left with weakness in my left arm and leg.

'It's really scary as I've always ridden horses and to think that I may never even be able to get on a horse again terrifies me.'

She added: 'I don't think it has really sunk in as I'm still running on adrenaline and on medication.'

Ms Fitzgerald, who lives in Chester, is alleged to have been assaulted at a junction in Shotton, near Chester, a short distance from Deeside Ice Rink, at about 7.20pm on Wednesday, September 17.

A 27-year-old woman from Merseyside was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released on police bail pending further investigations.

Det Insp Tim Evans of North Wales Police said: 'I would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or who may have information which may assist the police to call us.'
