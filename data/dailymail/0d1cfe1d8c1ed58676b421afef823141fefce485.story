The aunt of convicted rapist Ched Evans has criticised the footballer for not showing any remorse.

Nina Evans, 56, urged her disgraced nephew - who has always maintained his innocence - to apologise to his victim.

The addiction counsellor from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’

No remorse: Ched Evans (left) broke his silence this week to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right)

She told The Sun journalist Ruth Warrander: ‘Ched won’t grasp or listen. He won’t admit he’s done wrong. He’ll never show remorse.’

Ched Evans, 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of rape and spending two and a half years in jail.

The angry attack by his aunt comes just days after he broke his silence for the first time this week to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25.

But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result. Ched Evans has always claimed it was ‘consensual and not rape’.

In response to the video published on his website, Nina Evans, who sometimes works with rape victims, said: ‘It cut me like a knife. I hoped he’d come to his senses and say the right thing.

Playing for Sheffield United: Ched Evans, 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of rape

'What about his poor victim? It’s a massive insult to her.’

Chiefs at Ched Evans’s former football club have banned sales of shirts with his name printed on the back, it was claimed today.

The store at Sheffield United’s ground Bramall Lane is allegedly refusing requests from fans for the number 9 and his surname on newly-purchased £45 replica kits.

Speaking to Daily Mirror reporters Jeremy Armstrong and Paul Byrne, a club spokesman said: ‘We will not print shirts with his name on if we believe it is in connection with him.’

Sheffield United, who are in League One, have denied offering the player a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again.

Nina Evans added that he had complained about his jail release terms that stopped him from going on holiday with Natasha.

She said: ‘He cried like a baby to his mum. He thinks Natasha’s the victim.’

Meanwhile, it was claimed that Ched Evans is writing a book which he plans to publish if he wins an appeal to overturn his rape conviction.

The former Wales striker reportedly began his autobiography after being jailed. As a convicted prisoner he cannot profit from any book sales, but could donate them to a charity.

A source close to Ched Evans told Daily Star reporter Jerry Lawton: ‘Ched reckons his story would make a very powerful book. 

'The court case, conviction, being sent down and how his girlfriend has stuck by him is explosive material. But he realises that the book would only work if he is eventually cleared.’
