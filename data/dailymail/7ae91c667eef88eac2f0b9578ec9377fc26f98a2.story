Three to five years into a marriage is the most common time for the man or woman to have an affair, a new survey has claimed.

According to research by AshleyMadison.com, the most commonly-used extra-marital dating website in the world, the ‘seven-year itch’ is a thing of the past.

Not only does infidelity start much sooner than this, the site also concluded that a couple’s first pregnancy is likely to prompt an affair.

We won't tell: AshleyMadison.com is the biggest extra-marital dating website in the world, with over 25million users from 35 countries, including the U.S.

Interestingly, the research showed that it is equally both men and women who are likely to cheat at this time.

AshleyMadison has 25 million members in 35 countries around the world.

It's founder, Noel Biderman, says the 
time when a couple first have a child is so difficult, it can prompt one
 of the spouses to cheat.

‘Sexual desires and attractiveness may decrease during and after the birth of a first child and trigger affairs,’ he says.

‘Often women no longer feel attractive, or are physically impaired by their pregnancy, whilst men can find sex in close proximity to their child problematic.

‘Therefore people find themselves searching for someone outside the marriage to help them meet needs that aren’t being met at home.'

The average age of AshleyMadison members is 30-40, with an equal amount of men and women seeking affairs.

AshleyMadison also recently surveyed 74, 6000 of its members from 26 countries - 33,500 from the U.S. - asking about how often they have sex with their spouses.

U.S. women topped the list when it came to sexless marriages, with 22 per cent of American women questioned, admitting to having no sex with their husbands at all.
