Cops are hunting for the driver of a red Ferrari that slammed into a car carrying two retirees, killing one of them and leaving his long-time partner heartbroken.

The owner of the 2009 Ferrari Scuderia, Radomin Delgado, is considered ‘a person of interest’ and is being sought after by the Florida Highway Patrol, but has not been named a suspect in the death of retired postal worker Jorge Arrojas, 60 – the driver of the car smashed into by the super car at over 100mph.

It is not known if Delgado was driving the car, but the well-known amateur race car driver has been ticketed driving at excessive speeds in the past, according to reports.

Arrojas and partner Miguel Larrieu, partners for over four decades and best friends since childhood, were in a 2012 Hyundai Sonata and had just merged onto a highway when they were rear-ended by the Ferrari, which officers told NBC Miami was traveling at a high rate of speed.

‘It was like an explosion,’ Larrieu told the Sun-Sentinal.

The Hyundai was sent tumbling through the air and over the guardrail, end over end until coming to a rest with Arrojas slumped over, his head on Larrieu’s chest. Larrieu frantically tried to wake his dead best friend, ‘in 10 seconds, my life as it was came to an end,’ he told the Sun-Sentinal.

‘Please Jorge breathe,' I must have said it 100 times,’ Larrieu told NBC Miami between tears.

A person of interest: Radomin Delgado, the owner of the Ferrari, is being sought by authorities for questioning

The driver of the car fled the scene and was not found by baffled FHP officers.

‘We don't know how he left the scene. Whether he may have been picked up by someone else, or called someone. Witnesses say when they went down to the Ferrari, they could not find the driver,’ FHP spokesman Joe Sanchez told NBC Miami.

Authorities know the car belongs to Delgado, but have not spoken to him since the horrific collision. Visits to his gated home by both the FHP and local media have been met with silence.

A lawyer hired by Delgado sent an email to the FHP saying that his client is invoking his right to be silent, according to officials.

‘The lawyer told us he had advised his clients not to speak about the case without him being present,’ FHP spokesperson Joe Sanchez told the Miami Herald. ‘He said his clients have invoked their right to remain silent’

Authorities want to meet with Delgado because they would easily be able to determine if he was in the car or not based on injuries or bruising he would have.

‘It's important that we see the owner of 
the vehicle because if he was driving the Ferrari, he's going to have 
some injuries and based on that injury, due to the airbag explosion or 
the impact itself, then we can go ahead and seek a warrant,’ Sanchez 
told NBC Miami.

Gone, but not forgotten: Arrojas lifelong partner said 'his absence will be missed forever'

Delgado was ticketed last year for driving over 100mph on a local highway, according to NBC Miami, he has not yet been charged in this collision.

Finding Arrojas' killer may be of some consolation to Larrieu, but it will not replace his life-long partner.

‘All I feel now is a big void, like I'm in a nightmare,’ Larrieu told the Sun-Sentinal.

‘Someone in a 20-second interval completely took (him) from me,’ Larrieu told NBC Miami, ‘his absence will be missed forever.’
