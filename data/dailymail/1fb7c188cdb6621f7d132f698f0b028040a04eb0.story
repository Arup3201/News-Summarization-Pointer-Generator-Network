Most of us hit our thirties and begin to fret about the onset of the signs of aging: the wrinkles, the greying hair, the cellulite, the saggy bottoms.

But grandmother Anne Bolton is already 47 and none of these predictable side effects have happened. And she really wishes they would.

The mother-of-four says she is constantly being mistaken for a woman half her age, and Anne, a market stall worker from Bristol, says looking like a 20-year-old is actually ruining her life - and now she's thinking about having cosmetic surgery to make herself look older.

Anne Bolton, 47, hates being mistaken for a woman half her age and wishes she looked the same age as her friends

'Everyone wants to look younger but I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say looking young is ruining my life'

Anne says that her youthful looks have ruined a marriage and two long-term relationships, as younger
men constantly chat her up. She also believes jealous friends have abandoned her because she makes them look older.

Her eldest son, who has recently become a father, hates being seen with her
after being mistaken for her boyfriend.

Now size eight Anne fears her youthful looks will mean a lifetime of loneliness
because she only ever gets chatted up by toyboys she has nothing in common
with.

She says: 'Everyone wants to look younger but I'm not joking or exaggerating
when I say looking young is ruining my life. I would do anything for a few wrinkles to look my age.

'Why I have none is a mystery to me but the older I get, the bigger the problem
becomes for me. I need someone to invent the reverse of Botox because I'm
desperate to look older.'

Anne married her first husband at the age of 24, but within a few years
they were bickering over her looks.

She said: 'I was in my late twenties but my
husband noticed much younger men looking at me and he started to get jealous.

'I wasn't interested, but as the years passed I remained looking the same age
and he looked older, which led to even more rows.

'We were the same age but he hated people thinking he'd married a younger
woman so I did my best to dress older.'

Anne - second from right, on a night out with friends - says she is forced to socialise with people in their twenties so she looks the same age as them

Anne used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son Arthur, left with his baby, but he got fed up of
his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend

Eventually it drove them apart. And despite having two sons together - Arthur,
now 25, and 19-year-old Kevin - they got divorced when Anne, who also does some
work as a TV extra, was 32.

Four years later, she embarked on a long-term relationship with her second
partner, who worked for the Royal Mail.

He was just two years older than Anne who, at 36, was often taken for a
twenty-something.

She says: 'At first he loved it and complimented me on my appearance. He said
he was proud to be with me.

'But soon the looks from younger guys triggered arguments. But what could I do
about it?'

The couple had two sons - Joshua, now 13, and seven-year-old Jacob - yet even
being a busy mother-of-four took no toll on Anne's looks.

She reveals: 'When he
was 42 I still looked 22. People didn't believe I had four children.

'He hated people asking if he was my dad or brother. I could see the way things
were going again.
I would have changed it if I could, only there is no operation to make you look
older.'

After five years together, the couple split up and Anne feared she would never
find love again.

She says: 'I was only chatted up by young guys. At first it was flattering but
then it got boring.

'They want to talk about cars and nightclubs but I needed something more. There's no way I would date someone the same age as my son. Toyboys do not
interest me at all.'

Eventually, aged 42, Anne met a 32-year-old.

He was mature enough for her yet, she hoped, young enough not to be concerned
over her looks. But she soon faced exactly the same problems.

She said: 'People would stare at us as if we shouldn’t be together. He even got
called a dirty old man. Nobody would believe I was a decade older than him and men would approach me
to chat me up when I was with him because they thought he couldn't possibly be
my partner.

'It became a nightmare. I was even accused of being a gold-digger because it looked like I was with a
much older man. It was driving us both mad. It led to rows. It was like history repeating
itself.'

Earlier this year, after five years together, they split up. Anne revealed: 'Once
again I found myself alone. I was heartbroken that my life was being so badly
affected by the way I looked.'

She has since struggled to meet any men her own age but has no shortage of
offers from men 20 years younger.

She says 'People think that must be great but I am a grown woman with four
sons. I don't want to date a kid. I want a real man, but men my age don't want to
date me because it makes them look like perverts. I feel caught in a trap and I don’t know what to do.'

It's not just her love life that has suffered because of her youthful
appearance. Anne used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son Arthur, but he got fed up of
his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend - making it impossible for him to
meet anyone either.

Anne says: 'Girls just assumed he was taken. He found it embarrassing to have
to explain to them I was his mother.

'I couldn’t believe that me looking young was stopping both me and my son from
meeting anyone.'

Friendships have 
also been wrecked by jealousy over her looks. She says: 'As they started
 to look older and I just looked younger, my friends saw me as
a threat to them.

'Their husbands would tell me how young I looked and it annoyed them so they
stopped inviting me out. It wasn't my fault but what could I do?

'Women my own age think standing next to me makes them look old. I can see them
looking me up and down - I've even been called a bitch.

'So I have to hang
around with much younger women. They are good fun but deep down we're not into
the same things. Some are younger than my son but what choice do I have?

'Because of the way I look I don’t feel I fit in anywhere - with young people,
or those my own age. I bring out the bitchy side in women so I'm scared to try to make new
friends.'

Anne, who uses just soap and water and Palmer's face cream, has even started
examining her face in the mirror in the hope of finding a wrinkle.

She admits: 'Most women dread them while I am desperate to find just one. But
my face and body are totally smooth.

'I’ve lost count of the times people have asked me if I could bottle my secret
and sell it - I'd be a millionaire if I could.'
