The amphibian-version of Nigella Kitchen appears to be a hit with these leopard frogs.

A recent video shows the creatures in a frenzy after discovering an iPhone at the back of a shed.

Footage of wiggling worms is then played to the crowd of hungry frogs who leap, pounce and hurl themselves at the glass.

The video (grab pictured) was uploaded to the YouTube by user Joe Myers. It shows an iPhone placed behind a sheet of glass. A clip of worms is then played on the device to a crowd of frogs

Throughout the video, the crowd increases in size and at one point there are more than 17 frogs all scrambling to get the best view.

And it’s lucky the phone is shielded, because frogs have been known to pull three times their own body weight using just their tongue.

While worms are part of their staple diet, leopard frog have also been known to eat other small frogs, and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes.

The video, which already has 12,000 hits on YouTube, was uploaded four days ago by Ohio-based Joe Myers.

'Quite a crowd gathers only moments after I put it on their favorite channel!' Mr Myers wrote on his Facebook page. 'I had to put the glass cover over it or they kept changing the channel.'

The leopard frog is most often recognised as the specimen used in science classes for dissection.

Their name comes from the pattern of irregularly shaped dark spots that cover their backs and legs. They are greenish-brown in colour with a white underside and light-coloured ridges on either side of their backs. 

The frogs can reach lengths of three to five inches (7.6 to 12.7cm) with the males slightly larger than females. 

While worms are part of their staple diet, leopard frog have also been known to other small frogs, and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes. 

It isn't the first time the animal kingdom has become engrossed in video footage.

A recent study found monkeys in the wild not only love watching videos, but they also tend to copy the behaviour seen on screen.

When scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana, they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves.

The study, undertaken in Pernambuco, Brazil, revealed new insights into how monkeys learn from each other in the wild, according to Austrian and Scottish researchers.  

While leopard frogs may be more enticed by flickering lights than footage of worms, scientists believe wild monkeys could prove that 'how-to' videos work just as well in the wild.  

‘How-to’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity, but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild

Twelve of the marmosets were able to open the box, 11 of which had seen it done first in a video. One monkey could do it after just seeing the still image
