If you think your dog is out of this world, just take a look at these.

Based on the characters of Star Wars, these adorable outfits mean dog owners can now dress their pets up as their favourite characters from the epic space movies.

Costume designers Rubies Costumes came up with the idea as part of its collection of outfits for dogs.

Star Paws: A range of costumes have been created to allow dog owners to dress their pets as Star Wars characters, including Princess Leia (left) and Yoda (right)

The Bark Side: The black helmet and sweeping black cape of Darth Vader will give any canine a makeover into George Lucas's ultimate villain

Among those the company has created is the long white robe and iconic head buns that make up Princess Leia's famous outfit from the first Star Wars film.

Alternatively, a brown tunic and giant green ears and matching paws will transform any dog into your very own Yoda.

The black helmet and sweeping black cape of Darth Vader meanwhile will give any canine a makeover into George Lucas's famous villain.

For the ultimate cyber-dog however, owners can transform their pet into an AT-AT, or All Terrain Armoured Transport, as first featured in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.
