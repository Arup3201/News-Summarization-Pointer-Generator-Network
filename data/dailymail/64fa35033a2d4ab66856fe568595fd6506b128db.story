A manhunt was underway on Monday after an armed fugitive abducted a woman from a Wisconsin hospital and fled in an exchange of gunfire.

Stantavious Armond Sillas, 20, of Racine County was named as the man on the run, according to the local sheriff's office. He was described as 5'11, 185lb and wearing dark clothing. He should be considered armed and dangerous, authorities said, urging residents not to approach him and instead call 911. 

Several schools in Racine County canceled classes  as authorities searched for the man they said abducted a female employee at Lakeview Specialty Hospital and Rehab near Rochester about 3pm on Sunday. 

Stantavious Armond Sillas, 20, was to be considered armed and dangerous , police said, as they continued to hunt on Monday for the armed fugitive in Wisconsin 

Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said deputies had a description of the man's vehicle and it was spotted about an hour later at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in nearby Union Grove. 

As a squad car approached, the 20-year-old man fired several rounds, even with shoppers in the parking lot, Schmaling said. No one was shot.

'The suspect was located, he pulled a gun on my criminal investigator and shot at him,' Schmaling said. 'My investigator returned fire and the suspect fled.'

As the man fled, he left the woman he had abducted in the parking lot. She was shaken, but unharmed, Schmaling said.

Officers from Racine, Caledonia, Mount Pleasant, Kenosha County and the Wisconsin State Patrol joined the manhunt in Union Grove, along with a helicopter from the police department in Winthrop Harbor, Illinois.

Lakeview Specialty administrator Billy Blasingame told The Journal Times that the hospital was locked down for about an hour Sunday while investigators interviewed employees.

Schmaling urged Union Grove residents to stay home on Sunday night.

Union Grove High School and the elementary school, Raymond School District, Yorkville Elementary and Kansasville Elementary canceled classes Monday because of the manhunt.
