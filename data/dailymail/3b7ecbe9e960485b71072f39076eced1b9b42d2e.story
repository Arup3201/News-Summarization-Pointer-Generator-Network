Three teenage high school students have been charged with a sex attack during a post-prom party during which a girl sustained 'substantial' injuries. 

Andrew Haynes, Fields Chapman and Damon 'Avery' Johnson, who are all 18 and were students at Calhoun High School in Ellijay, Georgia, could face 25 years to a life in prison if they are convicted. 

Gilmer County Sheriff Stacy Nicholson said police did not have enough evidence to charge the men with rape because a foreign object was allegedly used to assault the victim.

No further details of the alleged attack have been released. 

During a press conference Nicholson said: 'At this point we cannot say a true rape, as described in the Code section - intercourse - occurred.

'They are all being charged because we contend they were all three taking part.'

According to police the victim was hospitalised for several hours the next day.

Nicholson described her injuries as 'substantial'. 

More than 50 interviews have been conducted and evidence has been forensically studied before any arrests were made.

Experts were also called in to listen to feedback.

Nicholson said: 'About three days into the investigation we kind of knew where we were heading with this, but we wanted to make sure we got all the information before we put people in jail.' 

According to the agency, other people at the party who are under 21 will be charge for drinking alcohol underage. 

It is believed someone else witnessed the attack which no-one attempted to stop, Nicholson said. 

Christina Lewis, a Calhoun resident, told Calhoun Times: 'It breaks my heart that so many good people’s lives were destroyed beyond repair, and my heart breaks for the parents of these boys.' 

'My heart breaks for the poor girl in this situation, and I commend her bravery for not letting this alleged crime go unpunished.'

The three suspects were not allowed to attend their graduation ceremony on Friday. 

They have been charged with aggravated sexual battery and underage consumption.
