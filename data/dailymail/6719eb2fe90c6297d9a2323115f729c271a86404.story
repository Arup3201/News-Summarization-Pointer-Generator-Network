Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about unfair and extortionate penalty notices.

Complaints to the offices of Citizens Advice are up by 41 per cent in a year, while the number of people seeking advice via the charity’s website has tripled to 155,000.

The parking cowboys, which operate everywhere from hospitals and railway stations to supermarkets, are aided in a multi-million pound rip-off by a sweetheart deal with the government’s DVLA.

Complaints: Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about penalty notices. This is a file picture of a car park sign, with no suggestion that complaints have been made about this company

The DVLA has pocketed almost £25million in five years by selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to the firms without making sure they are operating within the law.

The firms are able to capture the details of vehicles by using number plate recognition cameras of the type used by the police to identify and track criminals.

Private parking firms requested driver details from the DVLA 2.5million times in the year ending March 2014, which was up by almost a third from 1.9million in the year before.

A Daily Mail campaign turned the spotlight on parking cowboys earlier this year and identified a number of horror stories, particularly involving hospital car parks where firms targeted cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment had over-run.

Subsequently, the local government Secretary Eric Pickles announced an investigation and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt introduced new guidelines for hospitals designed to end huge fines for trivial infringements.

Complaints to Citizens Advice (CA) included one from a pregnant mother who needed urgent hospital treatment but has hit with a fine that spiralled to £140 when her partner parked up and walked her in to the building.

A woman in Cambridgeshire was hit by an all-day fine after she dropped her son off at a retail park for his job and then picked him up again at the end of the day.

She was fined her for a six-hour stay because the firm’s number cameras failed to pick up that she left in the morning and came back in the afternoon.

In Greater Manchester, one man paid and displayed his ticket but the machine would not let him put in the vehicle registration. The firm charged him on this technicality.

In theory, civil law states that penalties for parking on private land without permission or for too long should reflect the loss suffered by the owner, however the penalties are often £100, which can be reduced to £50 if people pay up quickly.

CA analysed over 700 calls made to its consumer service July and September this year and found the average private parking charge was £83 but some people have been hit by demands for as much as £300.

One in six callers complaining about parking penalties on private land were hit with a charge even though they had bought a ticket.

Other problems included signs that were too small, too few or hidden away. There were also faults with ticket machines and number plate recognition cameras.

The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year how  MET Parking, which worked for McDonald’s, was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading

People complained about being targeted with a charge when they only stopped briefly, while many people found it difficult to get through to the company involved to pay the penalty.

This makes a bad situation worse because the charge is higher if it is not paid quickly.

* you followed the parking rules;

* you parked in the right place;

* you only stayed for the time you paid for;

* you bought a ticket and displayed it correctly;

* the parking company wasn’t responsible for looking after the land you parked on;

* there were no signs about the parking rules or to tell you not to park on the land;

* the signs were unclear or obscured;

* the place you parked in wasn’t clearly marked as being a restricted area;

* you didn’t own the car when the parking ticket was issued;

* your car broke down;

* the payment machines were out of order;

* there were compassionate reasons for not paying, such as illness or bereavement or another emergency;

* the parking charge is for the wrong amount, is too high or you have already paid it; or

* you have been discriminated against under equality law, because you are older, pregnant or have a very young baby and were hindered getting a ticket or abiding by the time limit. 

The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year how at least one major firm, MET Parking, which worked for McDonald’s, was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading and a firm of solicitors that was shut down last year because of staff ‘dishonesty’.

Some 155,260 people got online help around parking on private land from the CA website in the period October 2013-September 2014. That was up from 69,374 the year before.

Its offices helped people with 914 problems with parking on private land between July and September 2014 - up from 646 problems in the equivalent period the year before.

Industry codes firms are required to give people a ‘reasonable’ grace period for stopping but not parking, but this is not defined.

CA is calling on the British Parking Association (BPA), which represents the firms, and the Independent Parking Commission (IPC) to set out a clear grace period for all providers to abide by.

CA’s chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘The public is paying for parking firms’ errors.

‘Broken ticket machines, hidden signs, contact numbers that just ring out, and charges that fail to take into account emergency situations are leading to unfair charges. The sharp rise in parking problems reveals an industry that is letting drivers down.

‘Parking charges should be a deterrent but should also reflect the actual loss rather than just the whim of the firm.

‘We’re concerned firms are chasing drivers for fees entirely disproportionate to the length of time that a car overstays.’

She added: ‘Bogus and unfair fines from private parking firms are causing misery for motorists. We want parking companies to help drivers understand their rights.

‘A clear grace period should be agreed and stuck to so this there is consistency for drivers. Firms must also make sure their contact details are readily available and calls made to them don’t go unanswered.’

The BPA did not respond to a request for a comment on the increase in complaints. 

Previously, it defended its members’ activities, saying: ‘We want to make certain that parking enforcement is undertaken fairly, reasonably and responsibly. The practice of rogue ticketing on private land causes distress to motorists and small businesses alike and should be properly regulated.’

It said an appeals system exists for drivers who feel a penalty notice has been issued unfairly.
