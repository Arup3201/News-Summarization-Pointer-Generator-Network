It's like a scene from a movie.

This classic log cabin could easily be crowned the best in the world as it looks like something straight from a nostalgic family film.

The traditional wooden hut ticks all the boxes with its quaint characteristics and idyllic surroundings, cloaked in a glowing magical mist.

The idyllic Headwaters Camp Guest Cabin looks as though it belongs in a nostalgic family film

Designed by architect Daniel Turvey, the wooden hut is a five-bedroom dwelling with traditional interiors

The Headwaters Camp Guest Cabin's natural features include a stair bannister created from elk horns, furniture crafted from locally-sourced wood, and beams made from entire timber logs.

And in a stark visual contrast to the traditional interior, a pool table sits proud of place in the cabin's living area, bringing a touch of the modern world.

The hidden gem in the Yellowstone Park in Big Sky, Montana, US, is a five-bedroom yesteryear dwelling, which gives guests the opportunity to relax among exquisite surroundings, deep within the Madison Mountain Range.

The premium cabins at Headwater from from $270 (£171) a night and are the perfect spot to get away from it all. 

Decor accents have been crafted from elk horns and furniture was built from locally sourced wood

The fully-insulated cabin, which has a floor space of 1800 square feet, has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open kitchen and dining area as well as a coat and boat room for coming in from the great outdoors.

Inside, the walls disappear seamlessly into a structure that appears to be built 100 years earlier, with reclaimed finishes of dove-tailed timber planks and dry stacked stone - completed by talent sourced from artisans and craftsman who live throughout the region.

Four ponds each connected by man-made streams, accommodate heat exchange plates that serve the heating of the cabin, while Lone Mountain looms overhead, sheltering those inside from visual and weather extremes.

The 1800 square foot home is the perfect for any season - from a festive holiday house to a summer getaway

'Really what makes this project so special was the commitment on behalf of all the parties to push Headwaters Camp to a level that currently has no equal,' architect Daniel Turvey wrote on his website.

'In the big picture of things, the end product is a reflection of an owner’s exceptional vision and directive.'

The low-energy design has resulted in a unique, sustainable and one-of-a-kind LEED Platinum dwelling - the third home in the State to receive any form of certification.

The guest cabin has won an array of awards, including Mountain Livings 'Most Responsible Project of the Year' award in 12 US states, Respect for Cultural Heritage, Utilization of Historic Architecture, Natural Beauty and the incorporation of Sustainable Design Principals.
