Rio Ferdinand insists that he wants to continue ‘living the dream’ at Manchester United beyond this summer, but admitted that his future may lie elsewhere.

The central defender is out of contract at the end of the season; there had been talk that he was ready to retire, but the 35-year-old wants to carry on playing.

Whether that will be at Old Trafford remains to be seen, however.

Heading for the exit: Rio Ferdinand has admitted his future may lie away from Manchester United

Pundit: Ferdinand was part of the BT Sport team during Hull and Sheffield United's FA Cup semi-final

Ferdinand has only started nine Premier League games under David Moyes, and just three since the end of September.

United tend to negotiate new deals for players over 30 at the end of campaigns.

Ferdinand said it would be no different this time around but is unsure whether he’ll be at the club for much longer.

‘I want to continue playing - that’s the aim,’ he told BT Sport. ‘The legs haven’t given way yet. 

‘Whether that’s at Manchester United or somewhere else depends on what the club want to do.

‘We’ll have to wait and see at the end of the season. We’ll do what we did last season - speak and see where we’re at.’

Dream: Ferdinand says he wants to keep 'living the dream' and stay at the club

Out of favour: Ferdinand has started just nine Premier League games this campaign

Asked whether his preference would be to stay at United beyond his current deal, Ferdinand said: ‘Of course. That’s the dream.

'I’m living the dream and want that to continue.’

The former England centre half has suffered with niggly injuries, while Moyes is yet to settle on a defensive pairing.

Chief
 executive Ed Woodward is set to sanction huge pre-season spending that 
will see the manager attempt to lure reinforcements in the hope to 
arrest the chronic slide during his first year in charge.

First choice? Moyes preferred Chris Smalling to Ferdinand in the matches at Newcastle and Bayern Munich

Waiting game: Ferdinand will have to wait until the end of the season for a decision
