Primary schools were yesterday urged to bring Shakespeare’s plays to pupils as young as five in the hope they will ‘catch the bug’ early.

Gregory Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said that children should see historical dramas as well as works such as Romeo and Juliet, often seen as more accessible.

He believes the language should not be simplified for younger audiences.

Wide-eyed faces: The RSC has said Shakespeare in its original form, such as the recent Richard II starring David Tennant, can connect with primary school children

However, he admitted Education Secretary Michael Gove will ‘probably guffaw’ at the idea.

The national curriculum states that pupils should study two Shakespeare plays between the ages of 11 and 14, but makes no mention of primary schools.

Mr Doran said children could be captivated by abridged versions of Shakespeare long before they start secondary school, when they may come to regard them as difficult or boring.

He is due to meet education secretary Michael Gove to talk about the RSC’s work in primary schools, but predicted Mr Gove would ‘probably guffaw’.

‘You have to let the bug bite before kids get cynical,’ Mr Doran said.

‘Letting them get involved when they are 13 is much harder than getting to kids earlier, without all the prejudices and stresses and strains of the idea that Shakespeare is somehow difficult or boring or academic.

‘What Shakespeare is brilliant at is speaking to a lot of audiences at the same time and we can appreciate it on many different levels. And it doesn’t just have to be A Midsummer Night’s Dream or Romeo and Juliet.’

Mr Doran told the Sunday Telegraph he recalled being ‘grabbed by the stories’ as a child before becoming engaged by Shakespeare’s language as he grew up.

Reaction: The RSC said that even abridged versions of Shakespeare in schools produced 'dramatic' results

‘But it’s more than just good stories and nice language,’ he added. ‘It’s about ethics and morality.’

The education secretary has pledged to extend the study of Shakespeare’s works in state schools as part of an ‘unashamedly elitist’ approach.

Mr Gove has said keeping the ‘amazing intellectual achievements of our ancestors’ from children amounts to ‘stealing from their rightful inheritance, condemning them to a future poorer than they deserve’.

But while he has backed a scheme to introduce young children to Shakespeare, it focuses on Elizabethan themes in other areas of the curriculum rather than the plays themselves.

But Mr Doran said exposing younger children to the plays would capture a new generation of converts.

The RSC said it saw dramatic results when it performed abridged versions of plays in Shakespeare’s original language in primary schools.

Recently its production of Richard II, starring David Tennant, was streamed to more than 7,000 primary school children around the country.

At a school in Bolton where it was shown to a class of seven-year-olds, the teacher wrote: ‘About 20 minutes into the performance, as I looked around at all the wide-eyed little faces looking up toward the screen, I thought I was going to cry.

‘As one child in Year 3 said, “Miss, is this for real?” ’

Jacqui O’Hanlon, director of education at the RSC, said: ‘Even for the youngest children, it is all Shakespeare’s language.

‘They are never, ever working with translation. They don’t want to be patronised.

‘When you’re at primary school, nobody has told you Shakespeare is difficult. The earlier we start with children, the more is possible.

‘And there isn’t a play that you can’t do.’
