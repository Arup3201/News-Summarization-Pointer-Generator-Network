A family feud over a farmhouse that once belonged to Thomas Cromwell has become almost as bitter and complex as any that divided the Tudor court of Henry VIII’s chief minister.

The listed building – part of an estate bought by Cromwell when he was at the height of his power in 1538 – is crumbling following the fierce dispute, a court heard yesterday.

School governor Emma Stephens-Dunn, 36, and husband Nick, 42, planned to renovate Manor Farm to turn it into a family home. But they put the wrong type of tiles on the roof and were left with a £100,000 bill after planners ordered them to replace them with traditional ‘Collyweston’ tiles.

Manor Farm in Lower Benefield, Northamptonshire, which has attracted the ire of local planners after the owners used the wrong type of tiles on the roof 

When the couple replaced the roof's traditional Collyweston slates with conservation slates, planning chiefs demanded the roof be restored with the Collyweston tiles - a job which would cost at least £100,000

Desperate to rid themselves of this burden, the couple decided to sell up – but met opposition from Mrs Stephens-Dunn’s uncle, Michael Cawthorne, 69. 

His timber firm has operated on the site for 39 years and would have to move in the event of a sale. 

Mr Cawthorne, fiercely objected to being driven out of the converted barn where he lives because of the couple’s ‘irresponsible actions’, the court heard.

At a hearing last week Judge Patrick Talbot QC ordered the sale of the entire estate after concluding family relations had broken down. The judge added: ‘There is no real hope of the parties all living at the property together again.’

Mr Cawthorne told the court he could see no good reason why he should be forced to move and suggested dividing up the estate in order to let him remain at the home he shares with long-term partner Irene Barnes, 72.

But the judge said partition of the estate – the farmhouse, two barns and other outbuildings – was banned by a restriction in the title deeds. 

The property has been in Mrs Stephens-Dunn's family for years, and she and her husband had hoped to renovate it - only to run out of money after a row with council planners over the roof tiles

Manor Farm and its surrounding land - which includes ancient monument, Benefield Castle - was bought by Mrs Stephens-Dunn's father and stepmother in the 1970s

The farmhouse is part of a manor at Lower Benefield, near Oundle in Northamptonshire, which was recorded as having been bought by Cromwell in 1538, two years before his death. The statesman is the principal character in the BBC’s adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Booker Prize-winning novel, Wolf Hall.

Central London County Court heard the estate was bought by Mrs Stephens-Dunn’s father, John Cawthorne, and step-mother, Rachel, in the 1970s.

After Mr Cawthorne’s death in 2002, Mrs Stephens-Dunn and her growing family moved in to the property, with her stepmother living in another converted barn. 

Planners objected to the family’s attempts to replace the roof of the five-bedroom farmhouse in 2010, the court heard, and Mr and Mrs Stephens-Dunn ended up sleeping in the cellar with their one-year-old son.

Their other children, aged 13 to seven, had to share one room on the ground floor as the two top storeys were uninhabitable.

They moved out in September last year and are now living in Stamford, Lincolnshire, but remain saddled with a costly mortgage.

Mr Cawthorne yesterday said the roof was only part-finished when council planners halted renovation work. It has not been touched since. 

He added: ‘They [the Stephens-Dunns] have completely devalued the property. It is not just the roof, they demolished interior walls and installed dormer windows.

‘It is just so unjust. This has destroyed our lives.’

Under a family trust, the Stephens-Dunns will receive 60 per cent of the proceeds when the property is sold.

Rachel Cawthorne – who had no objection to the sale – will receive 20 per cent, as will Michael Cawthorne.

He said the estate had been valued as worth up to £1.3million in good condition, but estimated it was now worth about £800,000.

Mrs Stephens-Dunn could not be contacted yesterday. 

Thomas Cromwell, who is played by actor Mark Rylance in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, was one of Henry VIII's most trusted advisors

The son of a blacksmith, Thomas Cromwell was born around 1485, in Putney, and rose from humble origins to become a successful lawyer and politician - and one of Henry VIII's most trusted advisers.

As a young man, Cromwell, who is played by actor Mark Rylance in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, travelled to Europe, and is thought to have fought as a mercenary in the French army in Italy.

Cromwell had married Elizabeth Wyckes in 1515 and the couple had three children - Gregory, Anne and Grace.

But his daughters did not survive childhood, and Elizabeth died in 1528 - during an epidemic of sweating sickness. 

He rose to prominence after becoming an MP for Taunton, Somerset, and serving in the household of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, and played a key role in helping arrange the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine Aragon, enabling the monarch to marry Anne Boleyn. 

He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the King’s reform of the Church.

Anne had been one of Cromwell's strongest allies, but in 1536, the pair clashed over plans for the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries following reformation of the church.

The Queen instructed her chaplains to preach against Cromwell, leading to one - John Skip - to be called before the Privy Council and accused of various crimes including malice, slander,  lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, and inviting anarchy.

Anne had failed to produce a male heir, and was not popular at court, or among the people. 

She was accused of adultery with musician Mark Smeaton, Henry Norris, the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton and even her own brother, George, Viscount Rochford.

In a letter to  Charles V, ambassador Eustace Chapuys, wrote that 'he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble ... He set himself to devise and conspire the said affair'.

Cromwell, as depicted by Hans Holbein the Younger, was executed for treason and herecy in 1540 - which Henry later came to regret

Anne's marriage to Henry was deemed invalid, their daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate, and on May 28, 1536, Anne was executed - with the King marrying Jane Seymour two days later.

During his career, Cromwell served England's monarch Henry VIII in a number of roles, including the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Chamberlain, Master of the Rolls, Secretary of State, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Earl of Essex.

But Cromwell fell from Henry's favour after arranging the monarch's marriage to Anne of Cleves - which was annulled just six months after they married in January 1540.

He was beheaded for treason and herecy at Tower Hill on July 28, 1540 - the same day that Henry married Catherine Howard, but the King later came to regret Cromwell's execution, and accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell's downfall by false charges. 

Oliver Cromwell, who after the English civil war ruled as Lord Protector, was descended from Thomas’s sister, Katherine.
