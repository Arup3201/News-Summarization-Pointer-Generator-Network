Newcastle's top goalscorer Papiss Cisse is a doubt for Sunday's trip to Tottenham – but Ryan Taylor is back in the squad after two years out injured.

Senegal forward Cisse has not trained since last weekend's 1-0 victory over Leicester because of a knee problem.

He has scored four times in as many games since returning from a broken kneecap and his goals have helped ease the pressure on manager Alan Pardew.

But the Newcastle boss, who is also sweating on the fitness of calf victim Cheick Tiote, said: 'We have not got a crisis, but we have one or two we are kind of waiting for. Papiss, Cheick - I'm not really going to be clear on any of that until Friday. But we have got players in the group to cope if they don't make it.'

Without Cisse, Pardew could be forced to hand Spanish rookie Ayoze Perez his first Premier League start.

Meanwhile, Taylor is included in the Newcastle squad for the first time since August 2012.

The 30-year-old midfielder has suffered successive cruciate knee ligament injuries in that time, and Pardew said: 'Ryan should return this week and I think that's an inspirational story to everybody here and everybody in football, because this is a guy who has had terrible, terrible bad luck with cruciate injuries and he has come back again.

'It was so pleasing to put his name on the team-sheet this week to travel. That's good news for us, because he is a very, very liked guy here.

'He's just a good person to have at the training ground. There's been a lot of talk this week about professionalism at training grounds and what people bring.

'What Ryan brings is a real good knowledge and a good understanding, and also professionalism to the training ground that can inspire others.'
