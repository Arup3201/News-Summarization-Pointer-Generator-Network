Tragic: Bradford grandmother Joyce Moulson was adored by those who knew her'

The family of an 84-year-old widow who died minutes after yobs hurled stones and smashed a window at her house have today paid tribute to her.

Joyce Moulson's family said in a statement that she was a 'much loved mother', 'adored by those who knew her' and was best known locally for her 'glamorous blonde hair and dress style'.

Four schoolboys were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter last night. One of the 13-year-old boys has been released without charge.

Another 13-year-old and two 12-year-old boys were released on bail pending further inquiries.

Mrs Moulson had been plagued by anti-social youths hanging around on the street outside her home.

Mrs Moulson, from Bradford, fell ill at home ten minutes after a window pane on her door had been smashed at her terraced home early on Tuesday evening.

She had been having dinner with one of her grandchildren when she collapsed at about 6pm and phoned 999.

Neighbours said that the pensioner had been ‘targeted’ by troublemakers.

A post mortem conducted on Wednesday night established the cause of death as heart-related illness and further tests are being carried out.

Today a statement released by her family told how she was born in Liverpool in 1928 and moved to Bradford when she was a child.

The statement read: 'Later marrying her childhood sweetheart John, she began married life in the house where she was to live happily for the rest of her life.

'She was a much loved mother and was adored by those who knew her, both family and friends.

'Generally mum enjoyed good health and for an 84-year-old grandmother she lived an independent life with support from her immediate family.

'She was perhaps best known locally for her glamorous blonde hair and dress style. She would always dress smartly, even if only going across the road for a pint of milk.

'On Tuesday evening, she was having dinner with one of her grandchildren when a pane of glass was broken in her front door. Whilst the debris was being cleared she collapsed on the kitchen floor.'

She was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary but pronounced dead after arrival.

The statement went on to say that Joyce and her neighbours 'have seen intrusions into gardens and broken windows in greenhouses.

'The many high garden walls in the area appear to be an attraction for youths attempting to participate in "free running".'

Shocked neighbours described Mrs Moulson, who was a grandmother, as a popular figure in the area.

They also said that incidents of trouble had become all too common in the neighbourhood.

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said today: 'This area has really gone downhill. On a weekend there are dozens of kids congregating outside the shop just over the road.'

Another neighbour said: ‘I was just sat in my living room when I heard the kids outside.

‘But I didn’t think anything of it as I’m just so used to them congregating near our houses.

‘We’ve all had trouble with them in the past and I know this isn’t the first time they’ve targeted Joyce.’

The neighbour added: ‘She was an 
absolutely lovely old lady – a really happy, helpful person – a great 
neighbour. It’s just a tragedy.’

Tom Butler, 81, who has lived opposite
Mrs Moulson for more than 40 years, said: ‘She was a lovely woman. I 
just can’t believe that this has happened.

‘Something needs to be done about the yobs around here.

‘I’ve had a brick put through my window before and I’ve never done anything to anybody. How could this have happened?’

Julie Taylor, who owns a shop near Mrs
Moulson’s house, said: ‘Youths are always jumping on the wall outside 
her house and in the garden. Some of them have no respect.’

Mrs Moulson was well known in the 
local launderette, where she used to take her clothes once a fortnight. 
One worker said: ‘She’s really popular around here.

'She used to own a 
bit of land to the side of her house with her husband John who died some
years ago.

‘They sold it to a developer and they 
built houses on it and called it Moulson Close so I guess that she’ll 
always be remembered.

‘You do see gangs of kids round here but nothing like this has ever happened. It’s heartbreaking.’

Senior investigating officer Detective
Chief Inspector Simon Atkinson earlier said: ‘We received reports that three 
male youths had thrown stones at the address, which had smashed a glass 
door panel.'

The incident took place outside Joyce Moulson's home on Fair Road, Bradford
