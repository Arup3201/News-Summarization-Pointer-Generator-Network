This is the dramatic moment an amateur photographer captured a Kingfisher almost dropping its fish supper before swallowing the minnow in one gulp.

David Renney was in Gosforth Park Nature Reserve in Tyne and Wear with his camera when he spotted the colourful bird.

He said: 'It was over in a flash. I was lucky to be there at the right time with my camera ready.'

Seconds later, the Kingfisher has the doomed fish firmly within its beak as it prepares to swallow.

Mr Renney, 54,Â  from Washington, near Teesside said: 'That poor fish's face is so expressive - it's as if he really can't believe his luck.

'Kingfishers are beautiful creatures and very skilled hunters. It was a joy to photograph one in its element. It really lived up to its name.'

Kingfishers normally eat their own bodyweight in fish each day

A Kingfisher typically eats its own bodyweight in fish each day.

The common Kingfisher is regarded as the most colourful bird in the UK.

There are up to 350,000 individual Kingfishers in Europe alone.

According to ornithologists, Kingfishers usually perch above rivers scouring the water below waiting to pounce on any passing fish.

Mike Toms of the British Trust for Ornithology said: 'The bird is juggling the minnow so that it can swallow it head first.

'Kingfishers find swallowing fish easier this way as gill covers, fins and any spines should be flush against the body.'
