Customers who ordered a £20 computer game only to be sent a £170 PlayStation console by mistake have received a second, less welcome surprise - an email threatening them with legal action. 

The customers had pre-ordered a £19.99 copy of the game Tearaway from online retailer Zavvi, but instead received the game in a bundle with a brand new PlayStation Vita console, which sells for £169.99.

Now Zavvi has written to demand that they return the devices or face legal action. 

Online store Zavvi has written to shoppers after it sent brand new Playstation Vita consoles to customers that had pre-ordered a £19.99 copy of the game Tearaway

According to gaming website Darkzero, the email said: 'We are very sorry to inform you that due to an error in our warehouse we have dispatched the incorrect product.

'We are contacting you in order for us to arrange a collection of the incorrect item which is on the way to you. If possible, please keep the parcel in its original packaging ready to hand back to the courier.'

The email gave a deadline of 5pm on Tuesday, December 10 with a 'final notice' telling people they would face legal action if they tried to keep the console.

'This is our final notice to politely remind you that you did not order, or pay for, a PS Vita and if you fail to contact us by 5pm (UK time) on 10th December 2013 to arrange a convenient time for the PS Vita to be collected we reserve the right to enforce any and/or all legal remedies available to us,' the company added.

After realising the error, Zavvi emailed the unknown number of customers and threatened them with legal action unless they hand them back

'Please email feedback@thehutgroup.com with the correct collection details. We look forward to hearing from you shortly.'

It is unclear how many, if any, of the consoles have been returned by the deadline and Which? told Eurogamer it believes customers will have to return them.

'If a consumer has received goods by mistake then they are not legally entitled to keep them,' the consumer watchdog said.

'In any legal action the ruling is likely to be that the item should be returned because it was sent in error,' it added.

A spokeswoman for Zavvi said the letter was genuine. She highlighted advice from the Citizens Advice Bureau which states: 'Distance Selling Regulations do cover receipt of goods not ordered, but here the clients have ordered goods from Zavvi and are expecting to receive those.

'Upon receipt of the extra item(s) the client should contact the seller and inform them of the mistake.'

Zavvi declined to comment further.
