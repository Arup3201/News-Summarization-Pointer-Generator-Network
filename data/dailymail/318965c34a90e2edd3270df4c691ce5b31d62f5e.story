A young man has died of stab wounds after crashing his car following a fight outside a McDonald's restaurant.

Ayfon Saint-Hilaire, who is in his twenties, was allegedly stabbed outside the fast food outlet in Bromley Hill in Bromley, London, last night.

'This guy had crashed his car. He got out of his car and collapsed and died,' he said. 'We walked up the road to see what had happened and by that time all the police had arrived.

'The guy's family turned up as well, somehow they knew about it, so it got quite hysterical.
