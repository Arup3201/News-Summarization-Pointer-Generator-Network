Retired Marine Eddie Routh, the man accused of murdering famed sniper Chris Kyle and his friend, confessed to police officers on camera that he had 'taken a couple of souls' and had more to take, it was revealed during his trial Thursday.

The body camera footage shows officers in Lancaster, near Dallas, trying to coax Routh from a pickup truck in the hours after Kyle and Chad Littlefield were found dead at a shooting range in February 2013.

The video played Thursday in Routh's murder trial shows him negotiating with police while making comments like, 'Anarchy has been killing the world.'

The 27-year-old also talked about voodoo, hell, and the apocalypse, and wondered aloud to the cops, ' I don't know if I'm going insane.'

Routh eventually sped away from officers, who pursued and rammed the pickup before the suspect surrendered. 

It also emerged on Day 2 of the trial that two hours after the alleged shooting, Routh drove Kyle's pickup truck to a Taco Bell drive-through where he bought two burritos for $2.36. Prosecutors say the stop for a meal proves Routh was mentally competent when he killed Kyle and his friend.

Routh has pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charges on the basis that he is mentally ill, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Lancaster police later intercepted Routh parked outside a home where they had a 30-minute standoff, trying to convince him to exit the car.

Instead, Routh sped off and it wasn't until another car rammed into him that the chase was brought to an end and he exited the truck with his arms up in surrender.

Prosecutor Jane Nelson acknowledged in court that Routh made some 'odd statements' to police, but suggested that his reference to the apocalypse could have been a metaphor for world problems, reported the Dallas Morning News. 

Routh's defense attorney R. Shay Isham argued that his client's ravings served as proof that he was out of touch with reality that night.

'If it's voodoo that's upon us, is the apocalypse upon us right now?' Isham quoted his client as asking Detective Jesse Chevara.

The lawyer also quoted his client as saying: 'I can feel everybody feeding on my soul.'

Chevara, who was Routh's neighbor, tried to calm him down by telling him, 'You will defeat that evil.'

But the ex-Marine replied that the feeling he has is not going to go away. 

Routh is heard in the police video asking for his parents. Police eventually get them on the phone and he briefly talks to them.

At different points in the video, Routh made comments including, 'I didn't sleep a wink last night at all,' 'I don't know if I'm going insane,' and, 'Is this about hell walking on earth right now?'

Kyle's widow Taya Kyle is escorted from the courtroom on Thursday during a break in proceedings

The widowed Mrs Kyle sat in court this morning and listened to the testimonies of officers who arrested her husband's suspected killer

Texas Ranger Michael Adcock was one of the law enforcement officials to testify Thursday, and said that Kyle and Chad Littlefield were both armed when they were shot to death.

He said it didn't appear the weapons carried by Kyle and Littlefield were ever removed from their holsters. Their wounds included multiple gunshots to the back.

The case has drawn intense interest, largely because of Kyle's memoir about being a sniper who served four tours in Iraq. The Oscar-nominated film based on the book has grossed nearly $300 million.

Other police officers testified in court about the intense 30-minute standoff they had with Routh after he allegedly killed Kyle and his friend. 

While Routh was parked outside a home, an officer approached and spoke with the clearly distraught man about the shooting. 

'Eddie we all grew up together here. This will be best for everybody if you do as I ask you,' the officer coaxed Routh through a cracked window. 

A Lt Michael Smith testified that Routh said something to the nature of: 'He had taken a couple souls and he had some more souls to take.'

At one point, Routh's mother called and asked if he was ok.  Cops say Routh shouted back: 'I don't know!'

'Everything's just happening so fast...I don't know if I'm going insane,' he told the police officer. 

'That's what we need to figure out,' the officer responded. 'We need to figure out what you're thinking and then see if it's right or wrong.'

But instead of peacefully getting out of the car, Routh sped off as officers topped 100 mph through neighborhoods, school and construction zones in order to catch up with him. 

The chase was brought to an end when another car slammed into Kyle's pickup truck that Routh was driving and he came out of the vehicle with his hands held up.

Defense attorneys for 27-year-old Routh have said he was insane when Kyle and Littlefield took him to a shooting range in February 2013 to provide support and camaraderie. Routh faces life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder.

Routh's mother had asked Kyle, whose wartime exploits were depicted in his memoir, to help her son overcome personal troubles.

Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, had testified a day earlier, clutching military dog tags as she told jurors about her final moments with her husband, just hours before he and Littlefield were slain at the range.

Reliving the agony: On Wednesday, Taya Kyle told the court that her husband had never met Eddie Ray Routh before and only wanted to help a fellow veteran struggling to readjust to civilian life

Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash described Routh as 'a troubled young man' who on the morning of the killings numbed himself with marijuana and whiskey. He said a history of mental illness should not absolve Routh in the deaths.

During opening statements, a defense attorney had revealed a text message exchange between Chris Kyle and Littlefield as they drove to the lodge with Routh, whom Kyle had picked up at his house.

Kyle texted Littlefield: 'This dude is straight-up nuts.'

'He's (sitting) right behind me, watch my six,' Littlefield texted back, using a military term for watching one's back.

Tim Moore, an attorney for Routh, said Kyle and Littlefield's text exchange shows how Routh was spiraling out of control. He told jurors that Routh was suffering from severe mental strain that day and thought he needed to kill the two or they would turn on him.

Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010. Authorities say that after the shootings, Routh drove to his sister's house in Kyle's truck, admitted to the killings and told his sister 'people were sucking his soul.'

Routh's case has drawn national attention because a movie on Kyle's life, American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper (right), is currently in wide-release and has been nominated in the Academy Awards
