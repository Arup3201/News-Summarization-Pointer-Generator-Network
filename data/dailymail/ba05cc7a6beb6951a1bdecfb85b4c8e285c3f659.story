When millions of viewers turned on the TV in France, they were expecting to a see a weathergirl stick to her word and give a forecast naked.

Doria Tillier, 27, had boldly vowed to strip 
off if the France national football 
team managed to qualify for the World Cup finals.

With Les Bleus 2-0 down after the first leg of their play-off qualifier against Ukraine, she was confident they would lose in Paris on Tuesday.

But they didn't - and ended up winning 3-0 on the night, 3-2 on aggregate.

Predictably, the ratings went through the roof on Canal+ as millions wanted to see Doria stick to her word.

And she did... although not in the way viewers may have expected.

Instead of taking her clothes off 
on-screen, she made a series of jokes and allowed a long-distance back 
shot of her running across a field.

Doria said she would be 'a poil' - 
French for naked - but in fact presented the weather from Poil, which is
a village near Paris.

'It was a pathetic stunt - not funny 
at all,' said disappointed Canal+ viewer Remy Jacob. 'Everyone was 
hoping Doria would be a good sport, but it was all nonsense.'

Earlier Antoine de Caunes, who became 
famous in Britain as the Eurotrash presenter on Channel 4, and now 
fronts Le Grand Journal in France had said: 'You will be seeing Doria in
all her gloria!'

Doria, a former model and actress, has been presenting the weather on the nightly news and talk show since August 2012.

After France scored their second goal to draw level on Tuesday, she had tweeted: 'F***. 2-0 for France. I'm starting to stress.'

De Caunes, 60, presented most of the Grand Journal in English as his forfeit for also failing to predict the France result.

France last won the World Cup in 1998,
and were runners up as recently as 2006, and have some of the best 
English Premier League players in their ranks, including Mamadou Sakho 
of Liverpool and Patrice Evra of Manchester United.

De Caunes said: 'Some of you 
will see us as patriots, some of you will see us as idiots. Frankly I 
don't f***ing care. France have qualified.'
