As this old photograph from Somerset shows, it used to be water under the bridge.

But that was in the 1960s, when the river was regularly dredged.

Now, as the residents of Burrowbridge are all too aware, the width of this stretch of the River Parrett has practically halved.

The way we were: In the 1960s, a wide expanse flowed along the River Parrett in Burrowbridge, Somerset

Ticking clock: But as this recent photo shows, years of poor dredging caused earth to build up on the banks

Doom: So when the rains kept coming, the water had no way out other than to burst the banks

As a result it regularly bursts its banks, flowing over and around the bridge instead.

In startling contrast to today's scenario, the picture, taken five decades ago, shows a wide expanse of water passing through Burrowbridge with plenty of room for water levels to rise.

A matching image taken shortly before the recent floods reveals how silt and debris have gradually built up and extended towards the centre of the river.

The overflow holes in the sides of the bridge which were once above the water line now sit redundantly in the side of the banks, surrounded by grass and mud.

Critics blame the Environment Agency - which took over responsibility for river maintenance around 20 years ago - for failing to dredge regularly.

Bryony Sadler, 38, a founding member of the Flooding on the Somerset Levels Action Group (FLAG), from the drenched village of Moorland, said: 'The photo speaks for itself really.

End of the line: Some of the overspill from the River Parrett on the Somerset Levels, causing mayhem

'It shows the massive build-up that you get when you don't dredge .

'Looking at that photo is looking right at the problem.

'It shows perfectly the scale of neglect by the Environment Agency, and shows what we have been saying all along.'

The mother-of-two added: 'We have got to have dredging and it has got to be done properly. No half measures. No sorry excuses.'

Parts of Burrowbridge and its surrounding villages have been under water since the start of the year.

The rivers were once managed by the National Rivers Authority who regularly cleared silt and debris from the waterways, until responsibility passed to the Environment Agency.

Torrent: Pumps are in full flow at Dunball, Somerset, removing water from the King Sedgemoor drain and back into the River Parrett, but there are still millions of litres to clear as the risk of disease grows

Hard at work: Dutch engineers install the remaining pumps at Dunball, near Bridgewater in Somerset

The FLAG group has obtained rainfall records for the area around the Parrett and Tone for the last 20 years.

They reveal between December 1993 and February 1994 around 20 inches of rain fell - five inches less than during the same time this year.

A spokesman for the group said: 'So roughly the same rainfall but far more flooding now.

'What has changed? Dredging seems to be the biggest obvious difference between then and now.'
