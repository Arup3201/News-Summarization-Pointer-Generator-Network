Unscrupulous coffee producers are bulking out ground beans with lumps of earth and bits of wood, researchers have found.

Ground coffee is being supplemented with cheaper ‘filler’ ingredients including the likes of corn, barley, wheat, soya beans and rice.

The likes of acai seed, brown sugar and starch syrup are also reported to have been found in the product before it reaches supermarket shelves and restaurants.

A coffee to kick-start the day: But scientists say unscrupulous producers are supplementing ground beans with fillers ranging from corn and rice to twigs and mud

Cases of unwanted ingredients in the drink come amid growing coffee shortages in regions, such as Brazil, where droughts and plant diseases have dramatically cut back supplies.

But scientist Suzana Lucy Nixdorf and her team at State University of Londrina in Brazil say they have developed a way to nip coffee counterfeiting in the bud.

Her findings are due to be presented at the American Chemical Society National meeting today exposition in San Francisco today.

‘With a lower supply of coffee in the market, prices rise, and that favors fraud because of the economic gain,’ she said in a press release.

‘With our test, it is now possible to know with 95 percent accuracy if coffee is pure or has been tampered with.

‘After roasting and grinding the raw material, it becomes impossible to see any difference between grains of lower cost incorporated into the coffee, especially because of the dark colour and oily texture of coffee.’

The team is analysing a number of fillers considered impurities that can even be parts of the coffee plants, introduced at harvest, that are not supposed to be in the final product.

Wood, twigs, sticks, parchment, husks, whole coffee berries or even clumps of earth that are almost the same colour as coffee have been found.

Currently, tests include looking at the coffee under a microscope or identifying unwanted additions simply by tasting the coffee.

But the new test uses liquid chromatography – a sensitive analytical technique - allowing a closer look at the product ‘in an unbiased way,’ according to Ms Nixdorf.

This gives her team a much closer look at the ingredients in an unbiased way, according to Nixdorf. Chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is very sensitive and highly selective.

researchers claim

Martin Wattam, the executive director of the British Coffee Association, told The Times that he welcomed the new test – but added there was no evidence ground and roast coffee on offer in Britain had been bulked up with other ingredients.

He told the newspaper: ‘The Quality of coffee products varies internationally and some countries may not maintain equivalent standards of coffee enjoyed by many customers in the United Kingdom.’
