Faked? A woman calling herself Laura Crawford Buckley claimed she was dangled over the Thames

BBC radio presenter James Naughtie’s claim to have witnessed one of the most notorious, debauched Commons scandals of all time sparked a fresh controversy last night – nearly 30 years after it happened.

A host of political celebrities, including George Osborne and Jeffrey Archer, last week attended the launch party of Naughtie’s highly regarded political thriller, The Madness Of July.

The title is inspired by an incident, described in the book, that allegedly took place on the Commons terrace on a hot July night three decades ago when Naughtie was a young political scribe. It is Westminster’s equivalent of the ‘headless man’ photograph riddle in the Duchess of Argyll’s divorce in 1963.

According to banner headlines in 1985, a ‘topless woman’ was dangled over the Thames by Labour MPs during an all-night parliamentary sitting after a riverboat trip.

She later posed for risque photos and told how her ‘boobs popped out when tipsy Labour MPs dangled her over the Thames’.

Writing in The Mail on Sunday today, Naughtie says that he saw  it happen.

He states: ‘A favourite story in  the book is based on an incident I witnessed when a girl was dangled over the terrace of the Commons late at night by boisterous backbenchers and seemed likely to drop into the Thames.’

But a Mail on Sunday investigation into the real ‘mad night in July’ has finally uncovered what truly happened – and it is not quite as stated by the respected Mr Naughtie.

And for the first time, we can reveal the full cast of famous names involved. They include John Prescott; Mr Prescott’s close friend and confidante Rosie Winterton – now Ed Miliband’s Chief Whip; lobbying guru Matthew Freud – the future son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch; Guardian writer and media ethics expert Roy Greenslade and Labour peer Peter Snape .  .  . plus a topless model and a hellraising 1980s DJ.

According to accounts at the time, recounted by Mr Naughtie, Labour MPs were drinking on the terrace when an unnamed woman was dangled over the river, causing her breasts to be exposed, setting off the security alarm and resulting in anti-terrorist police being called to the scene. One report had the SAS leaping into action.

The late Tory MP, Geoffrey Dickens, claimed to have seen it and denounced the Labour high jinks.

Terrace: The incident was said to have taken place at the Commons Terrace bar, but it is in doubt

Days later, out of the blue, ‘busty kissogram Laura Crawford-Buckley’ claimed to be the topless woman and gave an interview to The Sun, posing with the Commons terrace behind and then stripping off for the defunct News of the World. Laura claimed she went to the Commons with ‘DJ friend’ Robert Pereno. She was plied with drink by Labour MPs who dangled her over the terrace and ‘fell out of the top’ of her dress.

However, Labour’s Lord Peter Snape, who was there, says it is ‘total nonsense’. Snape won £10,000 damages after a newspaper blamed him for the ‘scandal’.

Claims: James Naughtie, who presents Radio 4's Today programme, relives the account in the MoS

He claims Dickens lied – there was no topless woman, the kissogram  ‘made it all up’ in a public relations stunt, Naughtie got it wrong and wasn’t even there.

Speaking publicly for the first time about the incident, Lord Snape said the mad night on the Commons terrace started innocently when Ms Winterton, secretary to Snape and Prescott, then a rising Labour star, organised a boat trip for a group of Labour-supporting cyclists.

‘A dozen or so Labour MPs were on board – it became known as “the ship of shame” – though it was no stag-do, there were women MPs there too,’ Lord Snape chuckled.

‘It was a lovely summer evening and some of the guests joined us on the terrace for a drink. One of the blokes caused trouble and was asked to leave. One of the girls had too much to drink and was sick over the terrace. That is all.

'The stuff about a naked woman dangled over the terrace was fiction. I tracked down Dickens and he confessed he had two halves of lager and left the bar early. He was put up to it. Then some dolly bird claimed she was the topless woman. It was all a fake.’

Lord Snape also questioned Naughtie’s account. ‘I’ve been a regular at the terrace bar for 40 years and have seen Jim at The Savoy and even The White House, but never at the terrace bar. He’s too grand to socialise with the likes of me.’

Rumours that the ‘topless woman’ story was not all it seemed, surfaced weeks after the first headlines. Journalists’ trade magazine Press Gazette claimed the ‘kissogram’ and her friend Mr  Pereno had ‘hoaxed’ the News of the World.

It said Matthew Freud, at the start of his career as a celebrated public relations fixer, was involved.

Press Gazette later apologised, saying the paper had shown it ‘statutory declarations made by Freud and the lady in question reaffirming the truth of the story’.

A source close to Mr Freud told the MoS yesterday that ‘kissogram Laura’ had not been on the Commons terrace.

The source said Mr Freud helped Mr Pereno contact The Sun by giving him the phone number of Mr Greenslade, then assistant editor of the newspaper. 

Mr Freud, who was 21 at the time, has never lived it down. When  he married Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth in 2001, it was the  highlight of one of the wedding speeches.

The Mail on Sunday can find no trace of ‘kissogram’ Ms Crawford-Buckley. Actor, DJ, singer and ‘hellraiser’ Mr Pereno hit the headlines again, later in the 1980s, when he married 15-year-old ‘wild child’ Emma Ridley in Las Vegas.

A low-budget film about his life was made last year.

A friend of Mr Pereno said: ‘He has gone AWOL at the moment.’

Mr Greenslade said last night: ‘I was very close to Matthew Freud at the time but I don’t recall this story. The 1980s are a bit of a blur.’
