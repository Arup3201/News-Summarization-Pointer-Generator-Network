I’m in the middle of a beautiful dream. In this vision, I am lying on a wide, deserted beach. The Velvet Underground is ringing through my headphones (‘Oh, sweet nothing!’) and the afternoon sun is warming the backs of my arms and legs.

‘Perhaps I'll swim in the ocean, I think to myself. Or fish around in my bag for a book. Or maybe I should go inside and fetch a cold beer from the fridge.’

I smile inwardly with a sort of zen-like smugness. I have come to an important decision: I'm going to do nothing. Nothing seems by far the best option.

And then we can play Batman: Palm Beach is a splendid spot for a family holiday

I am rudely awoken by a four-year-old boy pulling violently on my thumb.

‘Can we play Batman now?’ he asks me.

I glance at my phone. It is 2.37am.

Suddenly, I cannot seem to remember: a) who I am b) where I am or c) why I’m here.

After some soul-searching, I come up with: a) a middle-aged man from South London b) Palm Beach, Florida c) on a family holiday with my wife and two kids.

After I have grasped these three salient facts, things begin to fall into place again, and I’m able to distract my youngest son with a box of apple juice.

Within a minute or two of playing Robin to his Bruce Wayne, we both fall asleep again - and I’m back on my fantasy sun lounger.

If you are planning on doing nothing - or at least trying to - Palm Beach could well be your dream destination. In this sleepy, prosperous corner of southern Florida, nothing is on the menu every day - and it is invariably delicious.

This is where Rod Stewart comes to do nothing. Where Donald Trump comes to do nothing. Where John Lennon and Yoko Ono came to do nothing.

It is where infamous stockbroker and conman Bernie Madoff convinced his victims to part with their life savings. And in return, he offered them, well, nothing, as it turns out.

A place for relaxation: Palm Beach offers white sands and sunshine 70 miles north of Miami

It is also extremely expensive.

Palm Beach is one of the richest towns in the United States, which goes some way to explaining why the guests at our hotel (we’re staying at The Four Seasons) don’t seem in the slightest bit phased by the $25 (£15) cost of the cocktails.

Still, there really is no arguing with the beauty of the hotel’s private beach.

On our first morning, I am gripped with a giddy euphoria. It is as though all this white sand were a drug entering my system through the pores of my pallid, city-dweller's skin.

The sky is perfect, the sand is perfect, the temperature of the sea, perfect. My shoulders drop about three inches from their default, hunched-up, hassled parent position, and any trace of angst seems to wash away in the broad, clean waves of the Atlantic.

The kids are having a ball, too. We spend hours switching from ocean to pool, then pool to ocean. There is a wonderful, lolling rhythm to it all, and as smiling hostesses unfurl umbrellas and serve ice-cold lemonade to our ocean-view table, I feel no pain.

To top it all, there is hot and cold running childcare.

The boys fall instantly in love with our 19-year-old babysitter Lisa. And as my wife and I head out of the door later that evening, they seem positively delighted to see the back of us.

We take a taxi along eight miles of winding coastal road, spotting John Lennon’s ex-pad and Donald Trump’s private club along the way. I wonder if Trump is familiar with Groucho Marx’s old adage: 'I don’t care to belong to any club that would have me as a member.'

A magnet for celebrities through the ages: Former American president John F Kennedy (left) used to bring his young family to Palm Beach for holidays; John Lennon and Yoko Ono (right) also had a holiday home in the area

Arriving in the centre of town, we feast on fire-roasted pizza at the posh but relaxed Buccan, then head out onto the street in search of adventure.

Presumably the real parties happen behind the high walls of celebrity mansions, because the place is dead by 10pm. Not that I’m complaining. It’s a beautiful, balmy evening, and we take a stroll through the wide streets, wandering into a restaurant-bar called Café L’Europe.

In the corner, a pianist is murdering Whitney Houston (not literally), while the immaculately dressed clientele sits in virtual silence. It feels like a Beverly Hills retirement home.

We are on the verge of giving up when a smiley lady approaches us. She introduces herself as Danielle and begins to talk animatedly about turtles.

‘You must visit the sanctuary,’ she insists. ‘Your boys will love it!’

Danielle introduces us to her husband, Bill, an eyewear mogul from Minnesota. We make small talk for a while as they settle down at the bar to eat dinner.

‘You’re not in Wall Street, right?’ Bill asks, suddenly suspicious.

‘God forbid,’ I reply.

He seems somewhat placated and very nearly smiles at me. ‘Those hedge fund guys keep coming down here,’ he offers, and returns to his smoked salmon without further comment.

On the money: Palm Beach exudes an affluent vibe, with sports cars and palatial homes

The following morning, the four of us manage to tear ourselves away from the beach for a few hours to explore the local area. After a stop-off at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center (Danielle was right. It’s fantastic) we take a short drive to the marina for a dolphin-spotting trip on a catamaran.

The kids are overjoyed - it’s their first time on a boat. And as if on cue, a group of five or six dolphins pop up from the waves directly in front of us.

'They’re a little late,' says Larry, our captain for the day. 'We’re gonna have to dock their wages.'

When the dolphins have disappeared into the deep, Larry fills us in on some local history.

‘See that?’ he says, pointing to a creamy white mansion house by the water. ‘That’s the old Kennedy estate. JFK would come down here twice a year with the whole family.’

‘I remember once when I was just out of college, they closed up the roads and he came tearing through town with his motorcade. They must’ve been doing eighty miles an hour. I mean he was hauling ass!’

‘As a matter of fact,’ says Larry ‘he spent his last weekend down here in Palm Beach. Just before he was assassinated in Dallas.”

I feel a sudden stab of pity for Kennedy – and also for his kids. Millions of Americans may have mourned the death of their president, but only two children mourned the death of their dad.

Tempting: Palm Beach's monied vibe is visible in the boutique shops of Worth Avenue

Watching my own boys kicking their feet in the surf, I’m acutely aware of how lucky I am. I don’t mean that I’m lucky to be in sunny Florida, or even to be staying in a fancy hotel - although I’m grateful for both those things. No. More than anything, I feel lucky to be right here in this moment with the people I love the most.

I don’t go with all that rubbish about the devil and idle hands. Do nothing, I say. Do it while you can.
