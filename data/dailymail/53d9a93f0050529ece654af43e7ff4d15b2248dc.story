It's 'same old Arsenal' after another under-par defensive display in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Sunday, according to Jamie Carragher.

The former Liverpool defender was scathing in his analysis of Arsene Wenger's tactics, even referencing his summer business in the transfer market as a reason why the club are struggling.

Arsenal threw away a goal lead with 16 minutes remaining at the Liberty, with the Welsh side scoring through Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis.

Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports 1, said: 'I've said it a million times in the last 12 months, same things, nothing new.

'Before the game Wenger was laughing, I don't think he'll be laughing now. He said he's getting the balance right between attacking and defending.

'For the equaliser he's got seven or eight players ahead of the ball with 15 minutes to go.

'How do you get counter-attacked when you're 1-0 up with 15 minutes to go? 

'The one opportunity when Swansea put quality in the box, [Nacho] Monreal was beaten, as we all knew he would be.'

Carragher believes Wenger's failures in autumn have stemmed from a poor transfer window and not addressing the issues from last season.

With Chelsea now 12 points ahead of Wenger's side, Carragher claims the club have gone backwards, and the Frenchman should have taken a leaf out of Jose Mourinho's book.

He added: 'Chelsea and Arsenal seem miles apart - and that's just because Mourinho identified what he needed. His team now look unstoppable as a result.

'They let (Thomas) Vermaelen go and they didn't replace him, these small details always cost Arsenal at the top.

'This stage last year they were top of the league with a healthy lead. The problem for Arsenal, and any team, is that you want to feel like you're making progress.

'They won the FA Cup. The next level, having won a trophy, they should make two or three big signings.

'But with Arsenal you never feel they're going to make those big signings to take you there.'

Arsenal finished three points behind Chelsea but won the FA Cup last season. Mourinho bought Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Filipe Luis, Didier Drogba and Loic Remy, while letting go of unwanted players for hefty sums.

Wenger brought in Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck, Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy, but Carragher feels it wasn't enough.

'They had a better season than Chelsea, but now they feel miles apart,' he said.

'Mourinho saw areas they needed to improve and signed in those areas. Even from last season [Arsenal] look like they've gone backwards.'
