A British-born man and his wife have been told by authorities in Iceland they will not renew their 10-year-old daughter's passport on the grounds that she is called Harriet – which is not on a government approved list of names.

Tristan Cardew and his Icelandic wife Kristin are appealing against the Reykjavik National Registry's decision, which also does not recognise the name of Harriet's 12-year-old brother Duncan either.

The couple, from Kópavogur, have for years travelled with their children using passports featuring the names 'Girl' and 'Boy' because neither of their names are recognised by the country's strict list of permissible names.

But when they came to renew Harriet's passport ahead of a planned family holiday to France, authorities decided to enforce a law banning the issue of any official document to people who do not have an 'approved Icelandic name'.

The couple have appealed the decision.

'They have deprived our daughter of freedom of movement,' said Mrs Cardew reported visir.is.

For parents in Iceland there is a list of 1,853 female names, and 1,712 male ones, and parents must pick from these lists or seek permission from a special committee.

All the names fit Icelandic grammar and pronunciation rules and officials claim they will protect children from embarrassment.

Parents can take from the list or apply to a committee with alternative ideas.  

This means in Iceland, which has a population of 320,000, you are allowed to name your baby Elvis, Viking, Frigg or Horn, but not Ben, Dominic, Jennifer, Liam or Yasmin. 

Although the law has become more relaxed in recent years choices such as Cara, Carolina, Cesil, and Christa have been rejected outright because the letter 'c' is not part of Iceland's 32-letter alphabet.

For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half. 

Harriet was rejected on the grounds that 'It can't be conjugated in Icelandic,' said according to Mr Cardew. 

Given names are even more significant in tiny Iceland than in many other countries - everyone is listed in the phone book by their first names, while surnames are based on a parent's given name. 

Last year a 15-year-old Icelandic girl has won the right to keep her first name, despite it being 'unapproved' by the state.

Bjork Eidsdottir did not know when she named her newborn girl Blaer 15 years ago, she was breaking the law.

In the eyes of the authorities Blaer, which means 'light breeze', was a male name and therefore not approved. 

It meant that for her entire childhood, Blaer was known simply as 'Girl' on official documents.

But Reykjavik District Court eventually ruled that it could indeed be a feminine name.

'Finally I'll have the name Blaer in my passport,' she said after the ruling.

The Cardew family have now successfully applied for an emergency UK passport from the British embassy. 

A handful of other states, including Germany and Denmark, also have this rule.
