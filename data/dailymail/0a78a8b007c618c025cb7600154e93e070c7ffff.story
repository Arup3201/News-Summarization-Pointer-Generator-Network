Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel says his city will offer food and housing to as many as 1,000 undocumented young children picked up at the US-Mexico border.

'The influx of unaccompanied child migrants is a growing humanitarian crisis that we can no longer ignore,' the mayor told the Chicago Tribune on Sunday.

Emanuel will use federal funds to build new shelters in addition to nine others in Chicago that already house some 500 migrant children.

He will also push for a  'broad based pro-bono campaign' to expand legal services offered to the minors.

Shelter: Emanuel will use federal funds to triple the number of beds his city currently offers to undocumented children

'While we have our own challenges at home, we cannot turn our backs on children that are fleeing dangerous conditions,' said Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama.

'We will do our part to ensure that these children are given access to services and treated fairly and humanely.'

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has also vowed to shelter some of the tens of thousands of children apprehended at the border.

Details are still being ironed out, but the city will likely use federal funds to shelter the children and offer them legal advice, the Los Angeles Times reported. Nonprofits are expected to find them more permanent accommodations.

'Before you get partisan, before you tell me where you are on immigration: these are children,' Garcetti told reporters recently, according to the paper.

'As a father, who are we as Americans if we don’t step forward first and say: these kids who are isolated, alone … let’s get them someplace safe and secure.'

The mayors are responding to the growing crisis in the US border, where more than 57,500 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended since October, according to US Customs and Border Protection.

The Obama administration is studying a pilot program that would grant refugee status to young immigrants even before they arrive in the US.

The 
program, which would begin with Honduras, would screen youths in their 
home country to determine if they qualify for refugee status.

Officials
 say no decision has been made and the plan is part of a wide range of 
ideas being considered to slow the influx of unaccompanied minors 
arriving at the US-Mexico border.
