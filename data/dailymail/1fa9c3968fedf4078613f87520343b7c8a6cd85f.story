The hospital on Ellis Island where thousands of immigrants had their hopes of reaching the United States cut short by tuberculosis and scarlet fever will open in October for tours and an art installation.

1.2million immigrants entered the hospital between 1901 and 1954, heading into the United States if they were healthy enough, dying in the complex if they weren't.

'If you found yourself in this room, you were either too sick to survive or too sick to stay,' tour guide Jessica Cameron-Bush told the Associated Press. 'And this was your last view — the Statue of Liberty.'

Unrestored: Organizers decided to test the facility for safety - but not restore it - after Hurricane Sandy hit in order to draw attention to the need to perform upkeep on historic buildings

The facility is still the biggest ever endeavor of the U.S. Public Health Service, designed to screen out immigrants that were deemed too sick to enter the country and treat those that could be helped.

The 29-building complex housed rooms to treat contagious diseases, assess mental conditions and provide obstetric care for pregnant women.

It also includes a morgue. Not every person that entered the facility made it out, and 3,500 people died on Ellis Island and a little less than half of them were children.

Immigrants were sometimes treated to the injustice of racism, as the mental health examination at the time included eugenics testing, which tested mental capacity through physical measurements.

Still, only 1 percent of the immigrants at Ellis were sent back due to health reasons, according to the New York Times, though the threat of deportation terrified many.

The hospital was previously home to an exhibit for schoolchildren, but the buildings were partially destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.

Frozen: The hospital remains in mostly the same condition it was in back in 1954 before it was closed along with the other immigration facilities on Ellis Island

Abandoned: A volunteer with Save Ellis Island takes a peek at a contagious disease ward (right) where patients hoped to survive and enter the U.S.

The nonprofit Save Ellis Island decided to open the facility and give guided tours, which will be offered beginning October 1.

Visitors will also see an experimental photo exhibit entitled 'Unframed - Ellis Island,' designed by the French artist JR.  

Indefinite wait: The morgue in the Ellis Island hospital features stadium-style seating for visiting doctors to come and watch as autopsies were conducted on patients that had died while in the hospital

Attention: A file photo shows an immigrant receive medical attention from a medical official while passing through Ellis Island

Screening: This file photo shows Jewish immigrants being screened after arriving at Ellis Island, with a test in Hebrew hung on the wall

Haunting: The faces of immigrant children look back at visitors to the facility, which will open with the photo exhibit October 1

Ghostly: A volunteer from Save Ellis Island wanders the halls of the hospital, checking in doorways. The institution was abandoned in 1954 as Ellis Island closed to immigration

Grounds: National Parks Service employee Dennis Mulligan pauses in front of one of French artist JR's wheat-pasted archive photographs, which are designed to fade away with time

Rooms in the hospital have pictures wheat-pasted on walls, doors and windows, archival photos of the institution that show the immigrants who awaited care and the doctors in surgical dress prepared to operate on them.

In one room, an immigrant family clinging to a broken glass window looks out onto the Statue of Liberty, just as those receiving care in the facility did a century ago. 

Screening: Lines of immigrants coming in through Ellis Island await a preliminary health screening, which was administered to decide who needed to be quarantined and treated and who was healthy enough to pass into the United States

Contagion: Docots at the communicable disease center screen patients to detect contagious illness that would need to be quarantined and treated by staff on Ellis Island
