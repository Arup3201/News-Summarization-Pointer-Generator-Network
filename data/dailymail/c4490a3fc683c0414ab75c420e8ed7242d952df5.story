A stunning luxury island which comes with six beaches, four houses and its own private runway is going up for sale for a staggering £6million.

At 681 acres, Innocence Island is the largest private island in the Exuma area of the Bahamas, meaning it has plenty of space for a six-bed house complete with 360 degree panoramic views and a giant swimming pool.

Wealthy jet-setters will even be able to charter flights from Miami, Atlanta and Toronto airports to the private runway, which comes with its own airport code - MYEY - and can handle small jets.

The stunning main building has a giant swimming pool, along with various sun decks, lookout points and outdoor dining areas

Innocence, the largest private island in the Exuma region of the Bahamas, also has pontoons jutting out into the sea which provide the perfect relaxation spot

Out on the pontoon guests can enjoy a bite to eat at the dining table or take a cocktail with them and lean against the bar looking out into the ocean

And if the owners decided to fly some friends out to the island with them and there isn't enough room left in the 3,000sq ft main house, then they can always put them up in a separate bungalow, which comes with its own meditation and yoga deck, alongside a gym.

If that wasn't enough, there is another four-bedroom property on the island, which should leave plenty of room for the island's caretakers to sleep in a fourth two-bedroom home.

Once there, guests will be able to chose between six gorgeous beaches to visit, along with a variety of lookout posts, sun decks, and idyllic pontoons jutting out into the sea.

Guests to the island will be able to feast on some home-grown produce as tomatoes, lemons, guava and mangoes all growing wild

With 681 acres to cover visitor's legs may get tired, so they could always take a golf buggy down to one of the six beaches instead

There are six beaches dotted around Innocence Island, ensuring that any guests that get flown there will have plenty of space to relax

There will also be plenty of space for the guests to sleep. As well as the main house, there is another bungalow complete with a gym and meditation deck

And when it comes to eating, why not try some of the island's own produce, with tomatoes, mango, guava and lemons all growing wild across the landscape.

Exuma is a district of the Bahamas which contains 360 islands. Since the native population were enslaved in the 16th century, the islands were completely uninhabited until the 18th century and provided a hideout and stash point for many pirates and thieves, including Captain Kidd.

Innocence Island is being auctioned for a staggering £6million by Concierge Auctions, USA in New York on the 15th May 2014.

There is another four-bedroom property for guests to use, which will leave plenty of space for the island's caretakers in the fourth two-bedroom bungalow

The main house has incredible 360 views out across the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas and the rest of the island

Whoever buys the island can charter flight to it from Toronto, Miami, and Atlanta, and the airstrip even has its own code - MYEY

The idyllic island measures a staggering 681 acres, which is roughly the same size as 520 American football fields
