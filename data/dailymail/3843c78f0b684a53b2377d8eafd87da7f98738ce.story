Roy Hodgson managed to put on a brave face on Saturday as he took charge of England's penultimate World Cup training session at the Urca military base in Rio de Janeiro.Â 

The England players were in front of the cameras for the first time since being eliminated from the summer tournament after two defeats in as many games.

Wayne Rooney cut a somber figure as he warmed up ahead of the training session.

'Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better...gutted!'
