Right Adam Rickitt is back in the spotlight as part of the pop group 5th Story, put together by TV show The Big Reunion.

Before that it's fair to say he had a roller-coaster ride of fame and fortune, including stints on Coronation Street and his time as a pop pin up in the late 90s.

But despite all that, perhaps it is the star's experience of bulimia that has most shaped him as a person.

Adam Rickett, currently starring in The Big Reunion, recounted his harrowing experience of bulimia onThis Morning and told how he had suicidal thoughts

Those who remember Adam's pop career will be familiar with images of his rippling six-pack and half naked dance routines.

However, the TV star revealed on This Morning that the catalyst for his bulimia was nothing to do with a desire to look good, but all started when he was injured during a rugby game at school.

'It all started in 1994 with a rugby match,' he explained. 'All I wanted was to be a rugby player and was under pressure through school.

'Then during one match I dislocated both shoulders and in hospital I picked up a virus that made me lose weight'

Adam went on to explain that the injury meant his rugby career was over and he became depressed, finding himself trying to figure out who he was.

'Looking back it went much deeper,' he said.

'I didn't know myself, I didn't fit in, I was so scared so I had fixated on rugby.

'Through the virus I picked up in hospital I lost so much weight so had been eating a lot to try to put it back on.

'One
 day I was sitting eating a big bowl of cereal and had been so focused 
on just eating and thinking about nothing else, that when I stood up I 
was accidentally, physically sick.

'I
 hadn't meant to be, but it made me realise I had wasted an hour and a 
half away, where I didn't have to think about anything so I did it again
 straight away.'

At his worst Adam admits to being sick up to 30 times a day and dropping to around 6st in weight.

He
 is keen to spread awareness of the illness as 11 per cent of sufferers 
are men and Adam stresses that eating disorders are the same as any 
other mental illness and the that the driving force is not always about 
physical appearance.

Adam Rickitt ,35, suffered from bulimia and wants people to treat eating disorders just like any other mental illness, adding they are not about vanity

'I'm trying to make people realise that an eating disorder is like any other mental illness.

'It's about focusing on one thing.'

Adam
 says if someone is suffering an eating disorder there is more than 
likely an under lying issue, which goes deeper than how they feel about 
the way they look and that that is simply something to focus on as a 
distraction.

'If someone doesn't love themselves, it's about asking why don't they?' He said.

Of his own illness Adam revealed that he was so unwell he was bringing up blood and that those around him knew but had no idea how to help.

'I was throwing up blood, I knew everybody knew, I was acting different.

'Everybody knew but didn't know how to help and I was so embarrassed.

'I would go to bed every night praying not to wake up but I couldn't [do anything like that] because I knew my mum knew I had bulimia and she would blame herself.'

Adam described the horrible side effects of making himself sick such as 'always being cold' and often passing out and explained how it was a chance comment from his mother that began his turn around.

'It was Christmas 1995 and mum had just done a big weekly shop.

'She just said 'if you throw all this up I'll never speak to you again - it was like a cricket bat across the face.'

Slowly Adam began to try to change his ways. He tried various therapies that didn't work and in the end worked hard to make himself better.

'I did it methodically,' he said 'I checked my temperature each day [to see if he was getting better]

'I weaned myself off being sick. I had to calm my body down because it was so tuned to being sick and getting rid of whatever I put in it.

'Quitting an addiction to something that involves food is very hard because you still have to eat.

'Getting
 over the physical side took around 18 months but the mental side is 
much harder and it took me until I was about 30 to be able to look in 
the mirror and know who I was'

This Morning's resident GP Dr Chris Steele urged anyone suffering from an eating disorder to visit a GP where they can be referred to a specialist and added 'there is no quick fix, it takes time.'

Adam Meanwhile, is performing as part of the man-band 5th Story - made up of other previous pop stars including Another Level's Dane Bowers, Kavana, Gareth Gates and Kenzie.
