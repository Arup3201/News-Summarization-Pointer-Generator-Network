An elderly couple, including a World War II veteran, have died in 'unexplained' circumstances as police officers await the results of post-mortem examinations to help them find out what happened.

The body of 89-year-old Maria Ziemba and her 94-year-old husband Jan was found in the house, suffering from multiple injuries.

Police broke into the property in Berkeley Road, Newbury, yesterday shortly before 10am after neighbours, worried they had not seen the couple since Friday, raised the alarm.

Detectives immediately called in scenes of crime specialists, and said that they were unsure whether anyone else was involved in the couple's deaths as all the doors to their home were locked.

A spokesman said that police were treating the deaths as 'unexplained' as they could not be sure whether whether they died accidentally, from natural causes or as the result of a crime.

Mr Ziemba was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for his injuries but died last night, Thames Valley Police said.

Police are investigating how the the elderly couple came to suffer multiple injuries in the property in Newbury

Post-mortem examinations are expected to be carried out today.

The couple had lived in the property for more than 30 years.

Detective Chief Inspector Gill Wootton, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'Both the man and woman were found in the property in Berkeley Road and early indications suggest there were no signs of a forced entry.

'We are still investigating this incident and are yet to determine the circumstances of the woman's death and the man's injuries.'

Next of kin have been informed but formal identification has yet to take place.

Retired shop worker Pam Cooper, who lives opposite the couple's home, said she thought Mr Ziemba had a Polish background and had served on destroyer ships during the Second World War.

Mrs Cooper, 65, added that she understood Mrs Ziemba had been unwell recently. 'They have got family and quite a lot of friends, there are often people in and out of there.

'They are very well-liked. When he was about he was always chatty.'

Builder David Yates, a neighbour of the couple, said he would occasionally help Mr Ziemba with odd jobs around the home.

Mr Yates, 50, said Mr Ziemba had been torpedoed three times as he sailed with the Merchant Navy in the Atlantic convoys during the Second World War.

'He was very jolly and always happy to say hello. Jan was boisterous. Maria would come out fairly regularly and wander into town up until a few weeks ago but it's probably a good few weeks since I saw her in the road.'
