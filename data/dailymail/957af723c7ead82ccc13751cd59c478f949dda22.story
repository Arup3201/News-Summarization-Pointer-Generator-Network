A man and woman who were found dead in their New Jersey home this week may have died in a murder-suicide, police said.

The bodies of John Sykes, 47, and Felicia Hunt, 23, were discovered by police on Friday night. 

Essex County prosecutors told NJ.com. that officers had gone to their Belleville home around 6:30 p.m. to check on Sykes after he failed to show up for work.

Death: Police sai officers peered in the window of a house, not pictured here, and observed a male and female lying dead

'As the officers peered in a window they observed a male and female lying dead,' the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.

Anthony Ambrose, the chief of detectives for the prosecutor's office, said it appeared Sykes killed Hunt before taking his own life. 

Authorities said the two lived together at the house and 'appeared' to be involved in a relationship. 

Autopsies are currently pending and the Essex County Homicide Task Force is investigating the case.
