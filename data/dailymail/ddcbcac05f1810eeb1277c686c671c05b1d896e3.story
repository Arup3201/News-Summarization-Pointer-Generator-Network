If you've ever wanted to recreate a cinema in your living room, or turn your bedroom into a karaoke bar, Microsoft has the answer.

Its SurroundWeb prototype beams screens from a computer on to the walls of a room, including browser tabs, maps, documents, videos and photos.

The system uses small projectors and sensors to scan the layout of a room, including furniture, objects and people, to make sure the web pages aren't distorted.

Microsoft didn't reveal exactly how the 
system works, but said: 'After a one-time setup procedure that scans a 
room for projectable surfaces in about a minute, our prototype can 
render immersive multi-display web rooms at greater than 30 frames per 
second with up to 25 screens and up to a 1440x720 display.'

This creates what the firm calls the Room Skeleton.

This skeleton is created using a series of sensors that scan the layout of a room, including 
furniture, objects and people, to make sure the web pages aren't 
distorted.

It also 
uses a Kinect camera to map mouse clicks to hand gestures.

This means 
users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and if
 they mimic pushing it, the SurroundWeb system recognises it as mouse click.

Examples given in the research paper include videos being projected from a PC onto a large wall, karaoke lyrics displayed above a music video playing on a TV screen, or a photo of a window being used in place of a wall.

SurroundWeb is similar to Microsoft's Illumiroom technology it announced in January last year.

The difference is that Illumiroom used the sensors and camera to beam images from games onto the wall and immerse gamers in fantasy lands.

At the moment, the technology is just a proof-of-concept designed and tested by Microsoft Research, and the firm has not announced plans to release it to the public.

The designers also stress that the system is secure and can't detect faces or read documents in a room, such as bills on a table for example.

When the firm announced the Illumiroom last year, it said the system 'augments the area surrounding a television screen with projected visualisations to enhance the traditional living room entertainment experience.'

SurroundWeb uses the Kinect camera in a similar way to 'blur the lines between on-screen content and the environment we live in allowing us to combine our virtual and physical worlds.'

The Kinect sensor, and Kinect Fusion software, can track force and movement in highly accurate detail.

It can also be used in the SurroundWeb technology to 
recognise furniture and either incorporate chairs and 
tables directly into the browser, or mask them by adapting the video 
output to make the items appear invisible.

Microsoft said: 'Our system can change the 
appearance of the room, induce apparent motion, extend the field of 
view, and enable entirely new experiences.

'Our
 system uses the appearance and the geometry of the room (captured by 
Kinect) to adapt the projected visuals in real-time without any need to 
custom pre-process the graphics.'

In
 conclusion, the SurroundWeb research team added: 'Our [work] enables 
the implementation of previously proposed applications and novel 
applications while preserving user privacy.

'SurroundWeb balances privacy and functionality for immersive room experiences.'
