Read MARTIN SAMUEL's expert view on what the future holds for Hatem Ben Arfa

French Ligue 1 side Nice want to sign Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle.

Hull City are cutting short the France international's loan and he is surplus to requirements at St James' Park.

Greek champions Olympiakos have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. 

Ben Arfa joined Hull on a season-long loan after being criticised for a lack of professionalism by Newcastle boss Alan Pardew.

The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club

The Frenchman played just nine games for Hull and Bruce told BBC last week: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal.

'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match.

'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing.

'I hope Hatem takes in what I've had to say to him because his talent is there for all to see. But talent without hard work means you won't live up to your potential," said Bruce.

'To play for me you have to know you are playing for the team. To be a great you have to be a team player.' 

Ben Arfa, who has 13 caps for France, scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but had a strained relationship with the manager, with Pardew saying: 'He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say.'
