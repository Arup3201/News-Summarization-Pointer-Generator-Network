Dame Judi Dench and Helen Mirren have conquered the world of entertainment with their desire to play tough, uncompromising characters.

But the actresses have now been voted the most spirited and inspiring women of all time - beating icons Emmeline Pankhurst, Florence Nightingale, Princess Diana and Mother Theresa.

Dame Judi, 78, star of Bond film, Skyfall, heads the list of top 100 women which also includes Margaret Thatcher, Michelle Obama, Hilary Clinton, the Queen  and Cleopatra.

She beats Prime Suspect actress, 67-year-old Miss Mirren, who won an Oscar for her performance in The Queen, into second place.

Other veteran British actresses, Absolutely Fabulous star, Joanna Lumley, and Downton Abbey’s Dame Maggie Smith make it into the top ten.

They are ranked fifth and eighth respectively, ahead of Harry Potter creator, J.K.Rowling, in ninth position.

The survey shows that contemporary women are taking inspiration from modern day celebrities, heroines of the past and even fictional characters.

The list features singers Beyonce in 21st position; Adele (23rd); Madonna (42nd) and Rihanna (61st) as well as US actresses, Angelina Jolie (35th); Anne Hathaway (66th); Gwyneth Paltrow (94th) and Reese Witherspoon (97th).

Fictional characters which inspire women include Elizabeth Bennett from Jane Austen novel Pride and Prejudice (11th); Scarlett O’Hara, Gone With the Wind (14th); Bridget Jones, Bridget Jones’ Diary (15th); Jane Eyre (20th) and Clarice Starling, Silence of the Lambs (39th).

Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mocking Bird, rounds off the list in 100th position, behind British Olympic medallist Jessica Ennis (33rd); feminist Germaine Greer (38th), Kate Middleton (49th); Mary Berry (51st) and Victoria Beckham (75th).

Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst was ranked third, according to the survey of 4,000 women commissioned by Baileys.

But one in ten women surveyed claimed that social media such as Twitter and Facebook were as major a milestone for women as getting the vote.

More than half (54 per cent) believe the freedom to wear what they want was a turning point for modern women - from trousers becoming commonplace in the late 20th century to the miniskirt in the 1960s.

Other major breakthroughs for women in the last 50 years include improved better representation in the media (26 per cent) and more roles in the entertainment industry (23 per cent).

Half were inspired by the freedom to ‘behave as we choose’.

Tessa Dunlop, cultural historian and writer, said: ‘Over the last 60 years women have seen their roles expand unrecognisably from the traditional stay-at-home figure.

‘More money in women’s pockets and an increased degree of independence has provided them with more options, as both professionals and consumers. The female character has been revolutionised.

‘Women are embracing more roles than ever before – from Adele effortlessly juggling her singer/songwriter persona with that of being a new mother, businesswomen and partner to the increasingly successful Lena Dunham as US filmmaker, actress, comedienne and New Yorker.’

Researchers found that modern women are embracing more responsibilities than at any other time in history.

The average British women juggles 14 different roles such as wife, mother, worker, homeowner and handyman.

One in six women surveyed said they had more than 20 public faces as they lead ever more varied lives.

But just three per cent say they reveal their real personality to their bosses and only seven per cent open up with their colleagues - almost on par with strangers at six per cent.

Women said 35 was the age at which they begin to feel free to show their character and personality.

Strong: Joanna Lumley, left, and Margaret Thatcher, right, came in at number five and number six in the poll respectively

Meanwhile confidence (63 per cent); intelligence (56 per cent) and strength of character (47 per cent) were top of the list when it came to defining today’s spirited women, according to the survey.

This was in favour of the more divisive attributes such as being dominating (three per cent); edgy (seven per cent) and controversial (four per cent).

Michelle Obama, Adele, Dame Judy Dench, Dame Helen Mirren and Scarlet O’Hara are being immortalised in ice by Baileys, to mark the launch of a new bottle design for the liquer.

Bryony Stickells, Baileys marketing manager, said: ‘It’s no wonder that iconic women are inspiring us to succeed every day but also, most importantly to be ourselves and be proud of that.’
