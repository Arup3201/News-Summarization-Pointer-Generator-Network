The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria has been given the all-clear after an investigation into higher-than-normal radiation readings detected at a perimeter fence.

The monitoring system picked up 'elevated' levels of radioactivity overnight, leading to workers and contractors being told to stay away.

But following an analysis by safety staff, Sellafield said the levels were 'naturally occurring background radon'.

Evacuation: All non-essential staff were warned to stay away from Sellafield today because of 'elevated' radiation levels but have since returned to work

The company is still trying to establish exactly why the alarm was sounded even though it has now established the cause.

A
 statement said: 'Sellafield Ltd can confirm that the radioactivity 
detected by one of our in-air monitors overnight is not attributable to 
any issue or problem with any of our operations on site.

'Our
 in-air monitors are extremely sensitive and pick up on any abnormality.
 Overnight the monitoring system initially indicated elevated levels of 
activity. Following investigation and analysis, we can now confirm these
 levels to be naturally occurring background radon.

'The
 number one priority for us is, at all times, safe secure stewardship of
 the Sellafield site, which is the most complex and challenging nuclear 
site in Europe.

'As such we 
act in a safety conscious manner, and take cautious, conservative 
decisions, such as the one taken overnight to ask non-safety essential 
staff to stay at home this morning, rather than come to the site.

Message: Staff were told to stay away from the site in rural Cumbria unless 'requested to attend' work

'All
 of our plants and storage facilities were quickly confirmed as 
operating normally, and we were always confident that the issue posed no
 risk to the workforce or public because the levels being detected, 
whilst above background radiation levels, were still low.

'This
 view was reinforced by the fact that none of our other installed 
monitors were picking up any kind of increased levels. However, we take 
such issues so seriously that we investigated fully to confirm that 
everything was okay.

'Standard weekend working operations will continue, with day staff due back in on Monday as normal.

'We
 would like to thank our staff and the wider West Cumbrian community for
 their calm and mature response to events this morning.'

The
 Prospect union, which represents 5,000 nuclear specialists at 
Sellafield, said the elevated radiation readings were within acceptable 
limits and were not a danger to human health or to the plant.

National
 officer Gill Wood said: 'Higher than normal radiation readings have 
been detected at one monitor at a perimeter fence. As a precaution, 
non-essential staff have been advised to stay at home today while the 
relevant specialist team investigates.

'The
 company's decision to partially close some areas at the site is a 
precautionary and measured decision and a safety measure that is 
recognised worldwide.'

Controls: Workers in protective overalls in 1957 after the Windscale fire - Britain's worst nuclear disaster

Sellafield was the world’s first commercial nuclear station, and has suffered 21 'leaks' in 60 years.

The giant facility opened under the name of Windscale to produce plutonium for Britain’s H-bomb.

In 1957, a fire broke out in No 1 of the twin ‘piles’ or reactors, which became the worst nuclear disaster in British history.

It was only discovered 50 hours later, and took three days to bring under control.

The blaze was caused by heat building up in the reactor after a series of safety blunders. As the fire raged, workers at the plant used hoses to try to cool the reactor.

However, contaminated air escaped through the 400ft-high chimney and rose over the Lake District in a long grey plume.

Eventually, radioactive particles fell on to the local countryside or were caught in a changing wind, which blew them further inland towards Wales and over the sea to Ireland.

In 1982, the British National Radiological Protection Board issued a report estimating that 32 deaths and at least 260 cases of cancer could be attributed to the fire. But there are widespread concerns that this figure was much too low.

There have also been several other leaks.

In 1983 there was a notorious 'discharge incidents' where radioactive material was leaked, shutting a 10-mile stretch of beach and sea.

In 2005 it emerged there was waste leaking from a cracked chamber, which may have been undiscovered for eight months.

Bosses have been fined heavily after the incidents.

It is also claimed by groups like Greenpeace that various leaks while it was being built means that the Irish Sea is one of the most contaminated stretches of water in the world because waste was diluted and dumped into it.
