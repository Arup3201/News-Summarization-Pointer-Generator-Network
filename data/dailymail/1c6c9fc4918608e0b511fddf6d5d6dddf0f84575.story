A man was brutally attacked by the family members of a pedestrian he hit and killed with his SUV in Lakewood, New Jersey and a witness managed to capture footage of the incident with a cell-phone camera.

Juan Gregoria-Chacon, 26, was driving his SUV without a license on August 9 when he hit and killed Chandra Martin, 41, who appeared to have been crossing the street on Ocean Avenue.

NBC reports that Martin suffered head trauma and later died at the hospital.

Dead: Chandra Martin, 41, died after 'walking in the path of an SUV'

After Chacon got out of his vehicle to check on Martin, angry relatives and friends of the pedestrian began brutally beating Chacon until the cops arrived, reports NBC.

Investigators say they don't believe that Chacon was speeding nor was he under the influence. It appears as though Martin walked into the path of the moving SUV.

Cell phone footage of the dreadful event shows people punching Cachon until he was badly injured and on the ground.

Footage also shows a few bystanders trying to pull people off of Chacon until the police arrived.

Chacon suffered several injuries to his face and was taken to the hospital where he underwent surgery on Monday.

The driver's uncle Jose Chacon told reporters he doesn't think that two wrongs make a right.

'They punched him in the head,” said Chacon’s uncle, Jose Chacon. “For what? I know they were angry but that doesn’t fix the problem.'

'I know it’s not right,' Jose Chacon said. 'I know my nephew makes mistakes.'

This isn't the first time Chacon has gotten into driving trouble. He was cited twice for driving without his license and even though he was eligible for reinstatement in December he failed to pay the $100 fee.

Anthony Campbell who lived with Martin was later arrested for aggravated assault in connection to the attack.

Chacon has been charged with causing a death while driving without a license.
