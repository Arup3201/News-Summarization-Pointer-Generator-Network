Kim Jong-Un's recent weight loss came in handy at his latest public appearance, allowing him to squeeze into the cockpit of a fighter jet.

The North Korean dictator was pictured being shown the controls of the aircraft during an air force drill at an undisclosed location.

The tyrant was then pictured laughing jovially with officials, with the plane and a camouflaged military vehicle in the background.

The images mark a return to normal for North Korea's popaganda machine, which routinely features the despot visiting sporting and cultural events around the country and military and government installations meant to underscore the leader's control and show the country as prosperous and happy.

Kim disappeared from the country's official media for about six weeks, triggering a frenzy of speculation among North Korea watchers who analyse the tiniest details for clues to what is going on in the isolationist state.

South Korea's sky agency unveiled its theory for Kim's absence this week.

The National Intelligence Service told legislators on Tuesday a foreign doctor had operated on Kim in September or October to remove a cyst from his left ankle, lawmaker Shin Kyung-min said. He said the agency also told lawmakers the cyst could recur because of Kim's obesity, smoking and heavy public schedule.

After last being seen in state media on September 3, Kim reappeared on October 14 hobbling with a cane, but smiling and looking thinner.

The speculation about Kim's absence was particularly intense because of the potential implications for the long-running standoff between the international community and North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. 

Meanwhile, it emerged that ten senior members of North Korea’s ruling party have been executed after they were caught watching soap operas.

The officials were killed on the order of Kim, taking the number of senior government and military members executed this year to 50, South Korea's intelligence agency have said.

The ten were ‘executed by firing squad for watching South Korean soap operas, bribery or womanising,' the agency said.

The latest photo-op came as reports emerged of 10 ruling party members being executed for watching South Korean soap operas 

Pirate copies of South Korean and Chinese television programmes are widely available and traded on the black market in North Korea, The Telegraph reports.

Details on the executions were provided by the intelligence service in a report to the South Korean parliament on Tuesday, Yonhap News told the paper.

Kim Jong-Un’s father, Kim Jong-Il and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, fiercely protected the population of North Korea from any foreign or modern influences. The family has ruled the country since it was formed in 1948 at the inconclusive end to the Korean War.

However, Kim has struggled to shield the North Koreans as mobile phones and the internet has blurred borders.

Last week, South Korean media reported that six officials - including the minister of mail and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months.

An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'.

If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim assumed power in 2011.

This comes a day after North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years.

UN human rights chief Marzuki Darusman said he was surprised and gratified that North Korean officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting.

But he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader Kim Jong Un was insisting that he drop moves in a UN resolution to prosecute the country at the International Criminal Court.over its human rights record.

A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, published in February, detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.
