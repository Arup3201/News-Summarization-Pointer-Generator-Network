Following almost a year of rumours, Apple is said to be gearing up to finally launch its iPhone 6 at an event on 9 September.

Reports claim the Californian tech giant has scheduled a ‘big media event’ for this date - and is expected to use it to unveil its next-generation of iPhones.

The date ties in closely to previous events, which typically occur the second week of September.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres).

Last year, Apple announced its iPhone 5S and 5C at an event on 10 September, before revealing its updated iPad range a month later.

The claims were made by tech site Recode, but no official invites have been issued yet, and Apple has not confirmed the date.

However, sources speaking to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal have also quoted the 9 September as the day Apple chief executive Tim Cook will unveil the new devices. 

Apple is expected to reveal a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model at the event, which is said to include a thinner, case - similar to that seen on last year’s iPad Air - an improved camera and a faster processor.

It is likely to retain the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S.

The event may also see the debut of a 5.5-inch ‘phablet’ handset.

And if Apple follows suit from last year’s event, the rumoured iPad Air 2 could launch in the last week of October, alongside a watch.

Earlier this week Apple filed for Healthkit trademarks in the US and Europe ahead of iOS 8 being officially launched, said to be next month.

The software could be launched at the same media event on the 9 September.

While the US filing covered software, the latest European paperwork makes references to health, fitness, exercise sensors, medical devices, and watches.

In particular, it references ‘horological and chronometric instruments; watches; clocks; timepieces; chronographs for use as timepieces.'

This adds weight to the rumours the watch is imminent.

Speculation
 around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release 
date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate. It could launch at an event in October, alongside Apple's next iPad range
