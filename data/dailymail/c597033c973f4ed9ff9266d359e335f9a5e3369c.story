The minister who married Robin Williams and his third wife Susan Schneider today relived their wedding day and said his heart went out to the woman who was the star's 'soulmate.'

In an interview with MailOnline, Rev Peader Dalton reveals the Hollywood superstar - found by his assistant after hanging himself at his home earlier this week - was so in love with his bride, that the star was involved in every detail of the February 2011 wedding to make it perfect.

He recalls
 how the comedian made a bee-line for him after he'd given a sermon at a memorial service for the parents of one of his staff, and Robin told him he took great comfort from the minister's analogy of death
 being the same as birth.

Sacred vows: Robin and Susan wrote their own vows for the October 2011 nuptials. Rev. Dalton officiated at the ceremony and tells MailOnline there were around 120 guests at the low-key affair, mostly family, close friends and neighbors

Keeping the faith: Rev Peade Dalton was asked by Robin to perform his wedding ceremony after he heard the minister at a memorial service. Rev Dalton says the actor was quite taken by the idea that dying was merely a journey towards a 'fuller experience of life and love'

It
 was after this powerful first meeting that Robin decided he wanted the 
Irish minister – who is not affiliated to any particular faith – to 
officiate at his wedding to graphic designer Susan in October 2011.

The
 reverend, a former Catholic priest originally from Roscommon in 
Ireland, told MailOnline: 'Robin and his lovely wife Susan first came 
into my life about seven years ago.

‘The
 parents of a young man who worked for Robin on his properties had both 
died in a tragic car accident and I was officiating the memorial 
service.

‘Afterwards I remember that he came up to me and said he very much liked the service and found it very consoling.

'He said he was particularly touched with my analogy of death being similar to birth. I
 had said that when a baby is born they don't know what they are being 
born into - but they are being born into a fuller experience of life and
 love with their families.

'Death is the same - in my opinion we are not dying - we're born into another experience that is greater than ourselves and that is an extension of what it is to love and be loved.

Napa nuptials: Robin and Susan's wedding was held at the magnificent Meadowood luxury resort in St. Helena, California.

'He was very taken by this analogy and we talked about it for about 10 minutes – just the two of us.'

Robin's father was Episcopalian and his mother a Christian Scientist, but it is believed that Robin did not follow either path, although he embraced Christianity.

'You get a real strong sense of God when you go through rehab,' he said.

Rev Dalton says that Robin was a very 'nice, humble, appreciative man.'

‘He was very generous of spirit and this his death is truly a tragedy for the whole world,’ he said.It was some years later in 2011 that Robin asked the reverend to officiate at  his wedding to third wife Susan at the posh Meadowood luxury resort in Napa Valley, California.

Rev Dalton remembers with great fondness how happy and in love the couple were on their ‘beautiful’ wedding day and believes Susan will now be struggling to cope with losing her soul mate,' Rev Dalton said.

'The wedding day was very beautiful - they were very much in love and very quiet. Both Robin and Susan were very actively involved with the preparation of the ceremony.

'I like couples to be in the driving seat when it comes to the ceremony and I encourage them to write their own vows and decide how they want the ceremony to be. I remember that Robin was very involved - he didn't just sit there and nod his head.

'He had a special request to honor his mother and brother, who had passed away, by having a beautiful prayer - the prayer of St Francis read out.

'They both wanted to make sure their children were involved too - Robin's three children and Susan's two young boys, and were very appreciative that I made that happen.'

Say yes to the dress: Susan's stunning strapless gown was designed by Lily Sammii, a couture designer based in San Francisco.

Rev Dalton said around 120 guests attended the modest wedding - mostly family, close friends and neighbors.

There was no Hollywood glitz and glamor attached to it and the reverend says he doesn't recall seeing any of the big name stars who starred alongside Robin over the years.

'Robin and Susan created their own vows,' he recalls. 'It was a lovely gathering with people mingling and jingling with each other.

‘They also invited my wife and I to stay for the wedding dinner which was very lovely of them. Usually we just leave 20 minutes or so after the ceremony.’

The reverend, who lives in Sonoma, California with wife Margarita, said he was hit with a 'bolt of sadness' when he first heard Robin had died and was equally shocked to hear about Robin's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

He pointed out he was keen to avoid using the term suicide and urged people not to judge the Oscar-winning star’s actions.

‘I know that for me and rest of the community round here it came as a shock,' he said.

‘I have no idea how Robin responded to being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

‘I know it can mean having a horrible last 15 to 20 years of life and if you have other things going on in your life such as depression it may be harder to process it.

‘It could have been an exacerbating factor in his death but we’ll never know.

'I personally believe Robin has died as a result of depression.'

Rev Dalton, who conducts weddings and other services for an organization called Your Ceremony Matters as well as offering support and counseling, kept in touch with Robin and his wife after they got married.

He said he has reached out to them several times since their wedding to offer them his prayers and support – including in July when Robin entered a rehab facility in Minnesota.

And Rev Dalton sent his condolences to Susan as soon as he found out about Robin's untimely death.

He now believes that Robin’s passing leaves many unanswered and uncomfortable questions.

He said: ‘The great puzzle with the tragic way in which Robin died is how can a person do that to their wife and children? This was a couple that were absolutely in tune with each other - not in a mushy way - just in a very lovely way.

‘But you have to remember that depression hits the inner layer of our hearts. When someone is in that world – it’s difficult to see out.

‘People describe it as feeling imprisoned in a dark room with no switch – and in that situation it's so difficult to think of others. It’s legitimate for his wife and family and indeed others to ask why he did this.'

Wife Susan has released two moving statements since her husband’s death on Monday.

Remembrance: Rev Dalton tells MailOnline that Robin requested that the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi be included in the wedding service to honor his mother and brother, who had passed away

In the last one, issued yesterday, emotional Susan told how Robin’s legacy was the ‘joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles’.

She added: 'Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson’s Disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly.

'It is our hope in the wake of Robin’s tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid.'

Rev Dalton supported Susan's tragic plea that those who need help should seek it and said she was very selfless for thinking of others at this time.

‘It is touching that she is thinking of others who are hurting when she is hurting herself,' he said.‘I truly believe Robin Williams' tragic passing has impacted the spirit of humanity. Hopefully people will now seek the help they need.’

Rev Dalton added that he had not been approached to officiate Robin’s funeral or memorial service but believed like their wedding it would be a private, low-key affair.

He said: ‘It would be a great honor to officiate the funeral - it would be a profound privilege after having officiated Robin’s wedding and hearing the vows and prayers. 

‘Of course I would love to and I would like to respond in any way I can to help the family at this incredibly sad time.’
