These dramatic pictures show the moment a student was nearly swept out to sea after he defied warnings to walk out on a pier in stormy weather.

The RNLI were called to rescue Edward Laxton at 10am this morning who was spotted taking photographs on a jetty in Aberystwyth, Wales.

As the weather raged around him, waves lashed against the pier and swamped the 21-year-old.

Stranded! Dramatic rescue of student cut off by waves

RNLI crews were forced to rescue a man who had ventured to the end of a jetty in Aberystwyth today. First year university student Edward Laxton was taking pictures as the storm battered the harbour

The RNLI teams brought Mr Laxton aboard the dinghy in a lifejacket and took him ashore to safety

Fearing for his safety, the RNLI inshore rescue team launched and rescued the first year Aberystwyth University student from the end of the platform.

Pictures show the solitary figure standing at the far end of the pier as the water threatens to engulf him.

Video taken by a passer-buy shows the waves have cut the man off from the shore and he is stranded at the end of the jetty.

Rescue crews used their dinghy to get close to the him then strapped a lifejacket on him and brought him ashore. 

The RNLI says for the past 24 hours, the coastline and promenade at Aberystwyth has experienced significant damage caused from the strong winds and high tides, resulting in the Environment Agency issuing a severe flood warning and emergency services evacuating residents from properties on the sea front.

Despite repeated warnings to the public to stay away from the coastline, the man had walked to the end of the wooden jetty taking photographs of the huge waves breaking against the jetty and across the road at South Marine Terrace.

Such was the ferocity of the breaking waves, the man became trapped on the jetty resulting in several 999 calls by members of the public concerned that the manâ€™s life was in danger.

Police and coastguard teams were unable to reach the man, and the Aberystwyth RNLI 85 Class lifeboat 'Spirit of Friendship' was launched to assist, reaching the man from the sheltered lee of the harbour.

One volunteer crew member climbed up a 
ladder at the end of the jetty, securing the man in a lifejacket before bringing him back down the ladder to the waiting lifeboat.

The man was returned safely to the RNLI boathouse, where police were waiting to provide advice.

A
 spokesperson for Aberystwyth RNLI Lifeboat said: 'Whilst the extreme 
sea conditions are attracting people to the coastline, we repeat our 
warning to the public stay safe and to keep away from the shore line and
 dangerous waves.

'This incident highlights the dangers posed not only to
 the man taking photos, but also the danger that our volunteer crew 
members and other emergency services have been placed in rescuing this 
man.'

Police have been 
forced to step in and move foolhardy weather-watchers away from the 
shore across the country amidst fears that people were endangering themselves by getting 
too close to giant waves during a day of stormy weather.

A man had to be pulled from the sea 
to safety in the early hours today, after ignoring warnings about the 
dangers posed by the fierce storm.

Rescuers in Newquay, north Cornwall, plucked the man to safety after he went for a swim at around 4.30am.

He
 was spotted in waist high water by police and was dragged from the sea 
by Sergeant Reggie Butler and other officers and taken to hospital.

Officers
 secured a line to Sgt Butler, who waded out to pull the man to shore at
 Towan Beach, because there was no time to wait for other emergency 
services to get there.

Mr Butler tweeted: 'Great teamwork by my team again tonight rescuing male from sea. All played vital role, speed was essential.

'Not enough time for other emergency rescue services to get there, casualty was in danger, we had chance to rescue him.'

The officer added: 'Not heroes, just cops doing what cops do. Was an 'interesting' few minutes.'

A family in Cornwall narrowly escaped being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were walking along a sea wall.

A group of young men in Shoreham, Sussex risked their lives by playing around on the narrow ledge of a wall as waves crashed around them.

And in Devon, missing 18-year-old photographer was last seen heading towards the coastline with his camera.

Harry Martin was seen walking to the shore just as the worst storm for nearly 20 years approached.

Air, sea and land 
searches are under way along the coast and police say they are 
â€˜extremely concernedâ€™ for the safety of the teenager.
