Decision: Bruce Davis, a former Charles Manson follower who has spent more than 40 years in prison

The Los Angeles district attorney 
says she is opposing the impending release of Charles Manson’s right hand man who has spent more than 40 years behind bars.

Now 70-years-old, Bruce Davis was 30 when he was 
sentenced to life in prison in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to 
Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the 
Manson family.

Last year a recommendation to parole Davis came after the double-murderer’s 27th appearance before the board.

But District Attorney Jackie Lacey sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown last week urging him to reverse a parole panel's decision to grant Davis freedom, reported Fox News.

Lacey says Davis still lacks insight and genuine remorse for his crimes.

Davis was not involved in the infamous 
Sharon Tate murders in 1969, but he was convicted with Manson and 
another man in the killings of a musician and a stuntman.

Davis long maintained he was a 
bystander in the killings of the two men but in recent years he 
acknowledged his shared responsibility because he was present.

When the news of his possible release surfaced Manson family prosecutor Stephen Kay said he was alarmed at the prospect of Davis being allowed back on the streets.

Insisting Davis should die in prison, Mr Kay added: ‘Would you want to wake up and find Bruce Davis next door? I think not.’

Three years ago, then Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger blocked Davis’s release, saying he ‘would pose an 
unreasonable risk of danger to society.’

The parole bid was opposed by a former Manson family member, Barbara Hoyt, as well as Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate.

Davis has been in prison since being 
convicted with Manson and another follower Steve Grogan in the murders 
of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea, who worked at
the ranch where Manson and his followers lived.

Davis became a born-again Christian 
in prison and ministered to other inmates, married and divorced a woman 
he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter.

Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion.

Few followers of the infamous Manson 
cult have been released from prison. Grogan was freed in 1985 after he 
led police to Shea's buried body.

Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme was released
from prison in 2009 after serving time for the attempted assassination 
of President Gerald Ford.

Manson and two of his followers, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings.

Their
co-defendant, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009. Another
of the Tate killers, Charles 'Tex' Watson, is still in prison.

Monday will be the end of a 120-day review period by the entire parole board.

If they uphold Davis' parole recommendation, Brown then has 30 days to review the decision and either approve or reject it.
