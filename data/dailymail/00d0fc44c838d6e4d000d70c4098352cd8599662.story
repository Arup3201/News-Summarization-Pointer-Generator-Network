And breathe. But not for long. The football season is over, long live the football season.

Like a crown being passed from one monarch to the next, this moment when the World Cup and its inevitable period of discourse ends is the precise point attention switches to the new campaign.

The English football season begins in earnest in just 24 days. The Sky Bet Championship’s opening match, between Blackburn Rovers and Cardiff City, kicks off on Friday August 8 at 7.45pm. The Barclays Premier League follows a week later. Countdown commences.

Teams have already played pre-season friendlies, some have jetted abroad for tours, players have been signed and negotiations for more will step up an octave.

That saying about rats in London can be applied to games of football all year round: you are never very far from one. On Tuesday night, for example, Celtic get their Champions League campaign under way.

KR Reykjavik provide opposition in Iceland at 8pm. The Scottish champions have already played four warm-up friendlies since new manager Ronny Deila was appointed.

Also in continental action before sun sets on Tuesday night are The New Saints of Oswestry Town & Llansantffraid (TNS to you and I) away to Slovakian champions SK Slovan Bratislava.

On these shores West Bromwich Albion travel to Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday night for a pre-season friendly. Further afield, Manchester United fly to the United States on Friday for their American tour.

Dutch of class: Louis van Gaal has taken over as Manchester United manager ahead of the new season

VIDEO Van Gaal to start work straight away at United

The first match of Louis van Gaal’s reign will be against LA Galaxy on Wednesday, July 23 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. He has forgone a holiday despite taking Holland to the World Cup semi-finals. Wayne Rooney will be there, too, as he was allowed a holiday by England’s early exit.

In around 24 hours Van Gaal arrives in Manchester to meet his squad, which includes Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, bought for a combined £60million.

In less than 36 hours Liverpool are in Denmark to play Brondby, minus a certain Luis Suarez. The PFA and FWA player of the year has taken his gnashers to Barcelona. Defenders beware.

Brendan Rodgers seems in a rush to spend the £75m banked by the Uruguayan’s sale. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can have joined, Lazar Markovic is imminent, while efforts are being made for Dejan Lovren, Divock Origi and Wilfried Bony.

How many of them take the field against Manchester City on July 30 at New York’s Yankee Stadium remains to be seen. That fixture is perhaps the most intriguing before the real business starts – the Premier League’s No 1 and No 2 sides last season testing each other out in a ‘friendly’ scenario.

Arsenal are travelling across the Atlantic for one match, against Thierry Henry’s New York Red Bulls. New boy Alexis Sanchez, secured for £30m from Barcelona, is an exciting buy by Arsene Wenger but will be resting following World Cup exertions with Chile.

Tottenham, West Brom, Swansea, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa are among others visiting America. Newcastle and West Ham, who already have a 2-2 draw with Stevenage to look back on, will go to New Zealand.

Chelsea are staying in Europe and have their first friendly against Wycombe Wanderers in around 32 hours. You imagine Jose Mourinho is glad for an absence of long-haul flights.

Everton and Leicester are playing in Bangkok in 12 days, ahead of a repeat on the opening day of the Premier League season 20 days later.

The Sunday before the top-flight begins, Manchester City and Arsenal contest the first silverware of the season in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 10.

That traditional curtain raiser will focus minds to the 10 months of club football ahead. And there will still be three weeks before the transfer window shuts. Deep breath.
