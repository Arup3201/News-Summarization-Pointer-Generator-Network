'Nasty Nick' tried to poison Dot in EastEnders to take her pension money, and a Labour MP has warned that new pension rules could mean similar fraud becomes much more common

Ed Miliband faced anger last night after Labour officially backed George Osborne’s pensions revolution.

Labour rebels claimed letting the elderly cash in big pension pots instead of buying annuities – incomes for life – could lead to some running out of money.

And senior Labour MP Austin Mitchell said he feared it could see unscrupulous relatives or fraudsters preying on those who cash in pensions.

Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried it could result in threats similar to the EastEnders storyline in which ‘Nasty Nick’Cotton tried to poison his mother Dot to get her money.

The row erupted after Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves announced Labour would not reverse the pensions shake-up.

But Labour sources claimed a ‘substantial number’ of its MPs, including Shadow Ministers, were opposed to the decision.

‘This is a mistake and I’m sure many Labour colleagues share that view,’ said Great Grimsby MP Mr Mitchell.

‘The Government shouldn’t have done it and we shouldn’t be supporting them. It could open the way to more old people facing attempts to con them – just like Dot Cotton.’

A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday showed voters have similar concerns. Six out of ten are worried it could increase the risk of fraudsters preying on the elderly.

However, there is strong overall support for letting people cash in pensions. More than one in three Tories said they are more likely to vote for Mr Cameron as a consequence.

And they backed Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb in the so-called ‘Lamborghini dilemma’.

Mr Webb came under fire for saying people who picked up a pension windfall were entitled to ‘blow it’ on a Lamborghini.

Approval: More than one in three Tories are more likely to vote for David Cameron because of the policy, and backed Steve Webb MP who said pensioners should be able to blow their savings however they wanted

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was concerned about pensioners misusing their funds.

Asked who they backed, half supported Mr Webb and a third agreed with Mr Balls.

On pension pot priorities, personal investment came top, followed by paying off home loans and debts; helping children and grandchildren with house deposits or student fees; dream holidays and cars, with annuities in last place.

Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said the pensions reforms could store up problems, warning that many people could end up in ‘relative penury’.

One Shadow Minister said: ‘There’s been no consultation – just a surprise announcement from Rachel Reeves on the radio. The Tory plan is just a tax avoidance scheme for the wealthy, but why is Labour charging down that path?’

The row came as the Prime Minister hailed the ‘success’ of the Government’s Help to Buy’ scheme, which allows people to buy a home with as little as a five per cent deposit.

The scheme, extended to 2020 in last week’s Budget, has so far helped 17,000 buy a home.
