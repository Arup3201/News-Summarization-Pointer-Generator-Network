The first predators to walk on land were not afraid to bite off more than they could chew.

These creatures had teeth like steak knives that let them 'rip and dismember' larger prey, according to a new study.

New research claims the Dimetrodon, which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago, was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile-like teeth.

Research found that the Dimetrodon, which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago, was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile-like teeth

And it is thought that the so-called ziphodont teeth produced a more efficient bite allowing the Dimetrodon to prey on larger creatures.

Although most carnivorous dinosaurs had ziphodont teeth, researchers believe that serrated teeth first evolved in Dimetrodon around 40 million years earlier than theropods, a type of bipedal dinosaur.

Dr Robert Reisz, from the University of Toronto Mississauga said: 'The steak knife configuration of these teeth and the architecture of the skull suggest Dimetrodon was able to grab and rip and dismember large prey.'

The Dimetrodon lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago, during the Permian period

The Dimetrodon lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago, during the Permian period.

It is an example of a pelycosaur--one of the first families of reptiles to live entirely on land--and went extinct about 250 million years ago.

One of its most prominent features was its large sail, which ran along the entire length of its back.

Paleontologists speculate that the main purpose of this sail was temperature regulation or to help attract a mate.

Kirstin Brink, a graduate student from the University of Toronto Mississauga added: 'Technologies such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and histology allowed us to examine these teeth in detail to reveal previously unknown patterns in the evolutionary history of Dimetrodon.'

The study, published in Nature Communications, found that the four-metre-long creature was at the top of the food chain in the early Permian Period and is the forerunner of all mammals.

The Permian Period lasted from 299 to 251 million years ago and was the last period of the Paleozoic Era.

According to the research, Dimetrodon had a group of previously unknown tooth structures and were also the first vertebrate to develop cusps, teeth with raised points on the crown.

These are common in mammals.

The study also suggests ziphodont teeth were confined to later species of Dimetrodon, indicating a gradual change in feeding habits.

Dr Reisz said: 'This research is an important step in reconstructing the structure of ancient complex communities.

'Teeth tell us a lot more about the ecology of animals than just looking at the skeleton.

'We already know from fossil evidence which animals existed at that time but now with this type of research we are starting to piece together how the members of these communities interacted.'

Researchers looked at the changes in Dimetrodon teeth across 25 million years of evolution and found that skull shapes did not change even though tooth shape did.

'Teeth fossils have attracted a lot of attention in dinosaurs but much less is known about the animals that lived during this first chapter in terrestrial evolution,' added Dr Reisz.
