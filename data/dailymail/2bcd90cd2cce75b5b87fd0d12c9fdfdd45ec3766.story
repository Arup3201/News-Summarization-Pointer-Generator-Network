Murder trial: Gemma McCluskie's body was found in a canal and her brother Tony, 35, will stand trial over her death

The brother of a former EastEnders actress whose 'headless and limbless' body was found in a canal will stand trial later this year, accused of her murder.

Tony McCluskie, 35, appeared at the Old Bailey today charged with causing the death of actress Gemma McCluskie, 29.

He was remanded in custody to face over the death trial on November 12. A further hearing will take place in October.

Miss McCluskie’s headless and limbless body was discovered floating in the Regent’s Canal in Hackney, east London, in March.

She had been missing for a week after attending the £650million opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London

Miss McCluskie was last seen returning to her home that she shared with her brother.

Appearing in custody, McMcluskie spoke only to confirm his identity during a brief hearing at the Old Bailey today.

He did not enter a plea to the murder charge and his barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, did not make an application for bail.

She appeared in more than 30 episodes of the BBC soap opera as teenage temptress Kerry Skinner in 2001

Friends
 launched extensive searches across east London in a bid to find her, 
and former EastEnders co-stars Natalie Cassidy and Brooke Kinsella both 
appealed for help on Twitter.

The part was her only high-profile acting role and it is thought more recently she may have been acting as a carer for her elderly mother, who lived with her and her ex-builder brother.

Her body was found when a member of 
the public reported a suspicious object floating close to Hackney's 
famous Broadway Market near her home.

A distinctive tattoo led detectives to believe the body might be that of the former soap star.
