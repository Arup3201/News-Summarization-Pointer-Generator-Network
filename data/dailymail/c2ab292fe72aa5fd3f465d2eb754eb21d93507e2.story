The daughter of former boxing manager Kellie Maloney has said she refused to take counsellor’s advice to grieve for her father ‘as if he were dead’ after he revealed he is undergoing a sex change.

Emma Young, 36, believed her father – better known as Frank Maloney – was slowly dying after he refused to reveal he secretly wanted to become a woman.

The mother-of-two, who was extremely close to Maloney, has struggled to come to terms with the revelations that her father is transsexual.

She admitted that as she drove to meet Kellie for the first time she stopped twice and threw up, before driving round the same roundabout 10 times.

Speaking to the The Mirror she said: ‘I just couldn’t face it. I needed to do it for my dad’.

Mrs Young visited a counsellor to help her come to terms with her his transition and was advise she would need to grieve for him as if he was dead before she could welcome Kellie.

‘Whatever happens he will always be my dad. He has not changed inside,’ she added.

When Maloney separated from his first wife, Mrs Young went to live with her father while his boxing-promoting career took off.

She also worked alongside him as he managed his last high-profile fighter David Price two years ago.

She had grown concerned for her father’s health after he suffered a heart attack and bouts of depression, telling family it was ‘personal issues’ that were affecting his well-being.

The family watched as the 61-year-old was torn apart and Mrs Young worried they were going to lose him.

He had been living apart from his wife Tracey and had been spending more time in a flat on the South East coast, without letting anyone visit.

On Christmas Day 2012 he attempted to end his life after a family reunion he hoped for with Tracey ended badly.

Mrs Young found him behind the wheel of his car on the driveway of her home groggy and distraught.

He refused to go to hospital and it was the next day that he broke down and told his daughter the feelings that had tormented him since he was a child. She was only the second person he had told after his wife.

Mrs Young admitted she could not take it in at first but was relieved that he wasn’t ill.

‘All I thought was that if I had to choose whether I wanted to see him in a coffin or a dress, there was no choice,’ she said.

They spent the subsequent days talking about the full details of what her father had been dealing with.

Maloney revealed himself to the world as Kellie last week.

Mrs Young says she is proud of her father who is happier now he is not living his life in the shadows.
