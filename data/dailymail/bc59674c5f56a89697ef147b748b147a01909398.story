Italy's footballers may be preparing for one of the biggest games of the year against Uruguay - but their wives and girlfriends have already been putting on a good show in the stands pre-match.

Fanny Neguesha, Mario Balotelli's fiancee who he proposed to just before the World Cup, was in attendance as most of the Italians' biggest supporters wore replica shirts to back their men.

Italy need to secure a win or draw against Uruguay to progress to the World Cup's round of 16 but a defeat to Luis Suarez and co would leave them dumped out of Group D along with England.

Backing: Mario Balotelli's girlfriend Fanny Neguesha certainly isn't hiding her allegiances in Natal for Italy's game

The wives of coach Cesare Prandelli, right back Ignazio Abate, winger Lorenzo Insigne, striker Ciro Immobile, and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon were all present in the stands, along with Alessio Cerci's girlfriend.

Balotelli's fiancee showed off a shirt branded 'Fanny, 9' ahead of the game - and Valentina Abate, Jessica Immobile, Jenny Darone (Insigne's wife) and Federica Riccardi (Cerci's wife) all showed off their replica kit.

However, Buffon's wife Alena Seredova chose a Boy London vest to wear at the game, leaving Italy's women one player short of an impressive five-a-side team.
