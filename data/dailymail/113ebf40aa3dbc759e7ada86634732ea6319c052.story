A dopey criminal was caught on three colour CCTV cameras as he tried to force his way into a house with a screwdriver - before giving up after 30 seconds.

Police are now hunting the man in Rothwell, Northamptonshire, and they hope the resident's crystal-clear footage means it won't be long before someone identifies him.

The bungling would-be burglar was seen strolling through a side gate and into the back garden of the house at 5.50am on August 20.

Bungling: This would-be burglar made a failed attempt to break into a house in Rothwell, Northamptonshire, with a screwdriver - all while being captured on three full colour CCTV cameras. Police are now hunting him

He wandered up to a black van and tried to open the driver’s side door - which was locked - before attempting to break into a garage.

Undeterred by his failure, the man wandered to the back door and tried the handle without any success.

He then disappeared off-camera but returned seconds later with a screwdriver, which he used to try and force open the double-glazed kitchen window.

His tool, however, was no match for the window frame - which kept bending the screwdriver out of shape until he had to give up after 30 seconds and leave empty-handed.

CAMERA 1: First the would-be thief was captured on a CCTV camera at the side of the house, strolling through the back gate. The incident happened just before 6am on August 20, said police, who released the footage

CAMERA 2: The man then walked over to a black van belonging to the house's resident - and tried the door

CAMERA 3: In the clearest image of all, the crook is seen approaching the kitchen door in his bid to get inside

The resident's CCTV caught him once more ambling around the side of the house, out of the gate and into the road to make his escape.

Northamptonshire Police released the video today in a bid to catch the man.

The skinny crook is believed to be aged between 20 and 26, with sandy-coloured hair and a blue checked jacket with a hood, blue jeans and white trainers.

He was also carrying a black JD sports bag.

Anyone who recognises him should Northamptonshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

Casing the joint: Still being recorded on the third camera, he looks around before trying the double-glazed door

No match: The man is seen using a screwdriver to try and force open the tiny window - but it does not work

Battle for another day: Feeling defeated, the man then walks away from the back door and out the gate. The skinny crook is believed to be aged between 20 and 26, with sandy-coloured hair and a blue checked jacket
