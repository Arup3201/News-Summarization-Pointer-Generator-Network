A Southport man has been charged over a sickening crime where a cat's blood was smeared on a garage door of a Gold Coast home and a car set alight during an early morning attack.

The 19-year-old man will appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Wednesday charged with injuring animals by night, wilful damage and arson.

It is alleged he killed a cat during the incident as well as setting a car on fire and damaging the garage door of the home.

The owner of the cat that was slaughtered in the June 17 attack, Mady White, told Daily Mail Australia she had no idea how Moo - a black and white feline - became entangled in the Arundel crime.

Ms White said she had not noticed her cat was missing from her Bundall home - about 10km away from the Hazel Court address where the crime took place - until Gold Coast police officers showed up at her door.

'I knew of the threatening stuff from the news but I didn’t know it was my cat until the police came,' the 20-year-old said.

'It didn’t feel real. I thought I had seen her that day, but I had been unwell that day and the day before so I was unsure when I had last seen her.

'I was asleep when I suspected she was taken by one of my friends, which would have been Monday night.'

A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of last Tuesday while a resident's car was set on fire

'I never expected someone to do this to me and for no apparent reason to me. It wasn’t a threat to me.

'Pretty much it was my cat being at the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Ms White's other cat, Sylvester, is also mourning the loss of his playmate.

'They used to hide together and play together – they were always together,' Ms White said.

The cat's head was left on the front door of the Arundel home on Hazel Court in Queensland

The moment when the crime happened was captured on a fixed CCTV camera across the road and emerged last Wednesday.

Despite it's poor quality and a lack of light, the video manages to show at least two people loitering at the front of a garage door presumably scribbling the message: 'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!' in cat's blood.

The silhouetted figures make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are in the footage, but police have previously confirmed it was more than one.

The culprits can then be seen moving towards the car holding a flame fueled by an accelerant, before throwing it inside. The car is quickly engulfed in flames before the footage ends with it still burning.

In the rear of the image, at least two people can be spotted loitering in front of the garage door where it is presumed a message is being scrawled in cat's blood.

A Queensland police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia last week the pivotal moments of the film were at 2.17am and 2.19am in real time where the footage starts and car was set alight.

'At 2.17am you can clearly see people in front of the double garage door, and to the right you can see the small black square which is the car later set set alight,' the spokesperson said.

Detectives described the grisly slaughter of the cat, and the message which it was used to write, as 'abhorrent.' The RSPCA also offered a $5000 reward to anyone who had information that led to an arrest.

During initial investigations, a 19-year-old man was taken into police custody but was released without charge.

A Queensland Police spokeswoman said the man charged on Tuesday was not the same one.

'There have been a number of people questioned by police since the event occurred as part of the investigations,' she said.

Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told MailOnline last week the incident was likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants.

'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically,' he said.

The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', Senior Sergeant Lithgow said.

Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion at 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle.

The cat's head was left at the front door of the house.

People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning.

Detective acting inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message.

But he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links.
