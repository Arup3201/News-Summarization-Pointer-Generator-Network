A stunning racehorse has become the most expensive filly in British auction history after being sold for a staggering £4.7million.

Just The Judge won the Irish 1,000 Guineas in 2013 and the Grade 1 EP Taylor Stakes in October.

She was the first Classic-winning filly to be offered at a Tattersalls bloodstock auction in 20 years and bidding started at 500,000 guineas (£525,000).

There was a fierce bidding war for the four-year-old, with Sheikh Fahad al-Thani eventually paying 4.5m guineas (£4.72m) for the filly which he will own in partnership with The China Horse Club.

The £4.72 million smashes the previous record of £3.57 million paid for a horse in training in 2007.

Sheikh Fahad had joined the Sangster Family as a part-owner of Just The Judge towards the end of her juvenile season. She went onto prove a clever purchase, winning the Rockfel Stakes at the end of her two-year-old campaign and clinching Classic glory as a three-year-old with a her victory in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. 

Fahad has now bought out the Sangster Family, but has gained a new partner in The China Horse Club.

 Born in 2010, Just The Judge was bought as a yearling in Ireland for 50,000 euros. In her 14 races, she has picked up 5 wins and a further six places.

The Charlie Hills-trained filly's finest moment came at the Curragh last year where she produced a devastating turn of foot to win last year's Irish 1,000 Guineas.

Sheikh Fahad owns the most expensive filly in Britihs auction history

Sheikh Fahad bin Abdullah Al Thani is first cousin to the Emir of the state of Qatar, while his father Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani was prime minister  between 1996 and 2007.  

He is a director of Qatar Investments & Projects Development Holding ( QIPCO), one of the world’s leading private investment companies.

Sheikh Fahad is also a major player in Qatar horse racing.

Having only watched his first horse race on TV in 2008, and  first live race in the beginning of 2010, he had started buying horses in April of that year.

In his first year of racing, his horses won an impressive 26 per cent of the races he entered.

Sheikh Fahad now oversees the running of Qatar Racing and Qatar Bloodstock, both subsidiaries of QIPCO Holding, along with Pearl Bloodstock, which is solely his.

Combined, they have over 200 horses in training in seven different countries. 

Sheikh Fahad's brothers also share his passion for racing.  

His brother Joann has  enjoyed widespread success as an owner over the past 18 months with victories  including Olympic Glory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot as well as Toronado in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. 

David Redvers, from Tweenhill Farm and Studs, in Gloucestershire, entered Just The Judge on behalf of its owners.

He said: 'If anyone wanted a template for a racehorse, they just need to look at her - she is athletic and beautiful and has a fantastic temperament.

'This is a new, one-off tie-up with The China Horse Club. This has allowed us to race another year with her and keep her - as she was our first Classic winner, we were not going to give her up easily. This fits the Club's aims too.

'She will come back to Tweenhills for holiday and then go back to trainer Charlie Hills. She is healthy and well and running as well as ever - she won the EP Taylor only a month ago.

'We will campaign in the best races, get the best possible opportunities, and then she will retire to Tweenhills and visit the best stallions in the world.'

Born in 2010, Just The Judge was bought as a yearling in Ireland for around £40,000
