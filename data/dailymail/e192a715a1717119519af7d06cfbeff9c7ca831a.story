New dad Danny Care dedicated his match-winning try to his new son Blake as Conor O’Shea’s men began their European campaign with a comprehensive win at the Twickenham Stoop.

Nick Evans produced a faultless kicking display and set up Care’s second-half try in a game that struggled to catch fire but was lit up briefly by the Harlequins half-backs’ second-half combination play. With Castres’ defence charging up, former All Black fly-half Evans chipped deftly over the top before gathering his own kick and grubbering the ball through for Care to chase.

The England scrum-half, who is expected to start across the road against the All Blacks on November 8, showed he still possesses electric pace to outstrip the Castres defence before gathering and touching down.

Care, whose partner Jodie gave birth to the couple’s first child a week ago, celebrated in style by rocking his arms in cradle fashion in dedication to his new son as O’Shea’s men delivered an all-important Pool 2 win.

‘I presume the baby celebration came out in force,’ said O’Shea after the game. ‘I went up to Danny before the game and asked him if he was going to do what Romario did for Brazil during a World Cup when he celebrated in style. He duly delivered. I was delighted for Danny. He’s had a few sleepless nights but he’s loving every minute.’

At 34, Evans is entering the twilight of his career. But he combined brilliantly with Care and kicked seven from seven attempts for a personal haul of 20 points. He went past 400 European points for Quins in the process, while his 66th-minute double kick for Care was a rare moment of brilliance in an otherwise attritional game.

‘Our accuracy has been a big thing for us and something we’ve worked really hard on,’ said an elated Care. ‘We knew if we kept hold of the ball we could give anyone a game and that happened tonight. We’ve come out of it with four points and we’re very happy.

‘Nick Evans is pretty mature these days. He’s a wonderful player, one of the best I’ve ever played with. We’re lucky to have him in our side.’

O’Shea went into the game admitting his side’s Aviva Premiership form — they lie seventh with three wins from six matches — has been below par this season. But he was delighted with this gutsy display.

‘We’re really happy,’ he said. ‘We had 77 per cent possession in the first half. Our set-piece was outstanding. It’s a building block, a start. They are a good, physical side and we’re delighted to take four points to none. When you haven’t had a start to the season you’d like, you need guys to put their hand up. That’s what happened.’

Friday night’s display was still nowhere near as fluent as Quins would have liked but the West London outfit will take enormous confidence from a highly professional performance against a typically physical French side.

Castres’ South Africa-born scrum-half Rory Kockoff, who qualifies for France next week, kicked all his side’s points but was unable to inspire them to victory as Quins squeezed the life out of them with some intelligent kicking.

‘They just played a simpler game,’ said Kockoff. ‘They put a lot of pressure on us and I don’t think we took the right choices in trying to transfer that pressure. They deserved the win.’

Chris Robshaw gave a typically workmanlike display on one Quins flank while Luke Wallace was named man of the match on the other.

O’Shea’s men still gave away too many penalties, but the win gives their campaign lift-off.

Quins fans will also be hugely encouraged by the display of centre George Lowe, who produced a more than tidy performance on his return to action more than a year after a serious neck injury.

‘It’s incredible,’ O’Shea added. ‘To be out for 14 months with a career-threatening injury and to get through like that was superb. He epitomises what you need to make it in professional sport.’

Quins will take three days off before returning on Tuesday to prepare for next Sunday’s clash with Pool 2 rivals Wasps at Adams Park.
