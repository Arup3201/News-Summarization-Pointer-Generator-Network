She is one of the most iconic characters in video games. Her first outing on the PlayStation signalling the beginning of a new generation of gaming. Now, as the life of current gen starts to fade, who better than Lara Croft to celebrate the end of an era and offer us a glimpse of what's to come.

But this is no 'normal' Tomb Raider, and Crystal Dynamics have worked tirelessly to reboot the series. Perhaps their biggest statement of intent is getting Terry Pratchett's daughter, Rhianna, to pen the story.

Birth of an icon: All alone and battling the elements, Lara is ambushed by wolves early on in the game

As such, Lara is part of a team of archeologists that washes up on an island after a storm destroys their ship.

Isolated and all alone, it's not long before Lara bumps into a bunch of crazed Sun God-worshipping locals called the Solari who are killing any 'outsiders' in an attempt to bring their deity back.

How Lara deals with these obstacles help mould her from from naive, timid archeologist to gun-wielding femme fatale.

It's a breathless ride from start to finish, broken up with set pieces that give the Uncharted games a run for their money. However, some may feel the whole 'you can do it, Lara' theme (primarily from Lara's mentor, Roth) and constant sign-posting is a tad strong.

Still, this feels like a Tomb Raider game, albeit with a few welcome modifications. As the game progresses, Lara can upgrade her equipment and skills.

These range from combat upgrades such as the ability to throw dirt in enemies' eyes, to enhanced survival instincts that improve salvage and hunting ability.

Levels are well deigned, too, offering a surprising level of freedom in some parts. Often venturing off the beaten track rewards you with a secret tomb which can be explored for ancient treasures. It's a living, breathing island too.

Hungry wolves roam the forest at night, while timid rabbits and deer can be seen grazing on the island's lush greenery. The game lets you hunt all of these, but it feels more like an optional extra than something necessary for her survival.

Shine a light: When exploring dark caves and tombs, Lara can light a torch to help illuminate her path. When climbing ladders, though, Lara does not extinguish the torch and flames cover her face. Thankfully, this amusing feature does not cause her any damage

Combat is fast and frantic and the formidable enemy AI is a challenge whatever the difficulty. Lara has a variety of weapons available to her ranging from shotguns to assault rifles and pistols.

By far the most fun to use is the bow (later modifications make it even better). It's brilliantly rewarding watching a well-placed arrow hit a foe - a grisly death animation shortly following.

But the graphic deaths are not just for your foes, and - in similar vein to the previous games - Lara can meet her end in a number of gruesome ways.

Whether it's being crushed by a rock, impaled on a spike or eaten by wolves, all are particularly disturbing given how realistically Lara is portrayed.

This is thanks to actress Camilla Luddington, who conveys Lara's transformation brilliantly. She's sobbing her eyes out one minute, then boisterously taunting her foes the next.

The developers have mentioned their admiration of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, and this influence is clear throughout - both in the in-game cinematography and the dark, tense orchestral score.

Some gameplay decisions, however, may jar with fans. Although Crystal Dynamics have placed the odd puzzle here and there, this is very much an action game.

Indeed, Lara's kill count by the end of the game reaches genocidal proportions, which may make her 'transformation' feel less believable.

Run and gun: In fire fights, it pays to keep moving. If you stay in one place, enemies will throw firebombs and dynamite to flush you out from cover

Graphically, the game is strong - with impressive detail on even the most distant environmental features. Pop up is negligible and there's enough variation (although earlier levels are perhaps too dark) to keep the adventure from feeling stale. But it's Lara's animation that steals the show.

What starts as cautious footsteps and clumsy clambering soon turns into graceful rock climbing and death-defying leaps.

Not all of it is silky smooth, but more often than not it looks fantastic. Lara's facial animations, too, capture every drop of her initial doubt and anxiety, only to subtly become more confident and aggressive as the game goes on.

Naturally, the game looks its best on PC. On 'Ultimate' settings, textures are eye-poppingly realistic, and draw distances put consoles to shame. Most notable, though, is Lara's hair. Gone are her blocky locks, replaced by a free-flowing, insanely realistic head of hair made possible by TressFx.

The campaign offers between 8-10 hours or gameplay, and multiplayer adds some more longevity. However, although competent, multiplayer is not why you buy a Tomb Raider game.

You buy it for the story and in that respect, Tomb Raider delivers in almost every way.

Tomb Raider is out now.
