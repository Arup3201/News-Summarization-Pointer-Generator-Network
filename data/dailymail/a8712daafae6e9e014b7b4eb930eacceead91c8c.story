Swansea manager Garry Monk has labelled Aston Villa's in-form striker Christian Benteke a Boxing Day threat - but has hinted he would not swap him for his own powerhouse forward Wilfried Bony.

Belgian powerhouse Benteke has been back to his best in recent weeks following injury and suspension, grabbing a superb solo winner in Villa's victory at Crystal Palace before scoring possibly an even better goal in the 1-1 draw against Manchester United last weekend.

It has been a long road back for Benteke who missed six months and the World Cup after rupturing an Achilles tendon last March, but Ivory Coast striker Bony has had a profitable 2014, with his 20 goals making him the top scorer in the Barclays Premier League in the calendar year.

'They're both very powerful but have different types of game,' Monk said ahead of Villa's Boxing Day visit to the Liberty Stadium.

'I would say Benteke is more mobile, a run-the-channels type and probably covers more yards than Bony. But Bony is more effective in what he does.

'They're very much quality players and Benteke's coming into a bit of form now, but I always knew he would.

'He's always been a good player, he had that serious injury and it always takes a little bit of time to get back that sharpness.

'That only comes with games but he's looking sharp now.

Swansea manager Garry Monk said that while Christian Benteke is in impressive form, Bony is more effective

'He's a big threat to us and we're going to have to deal with it.'

Benteke's return following his dismissal against Tottenham at the start of November has coincided with an upturn in Villa fortunes, Paul Lambert's side taking seven points from the last 12 on offer.

Gabriel Agbonlahor is available after having his red card against United rescinded on Tuesday and Monk is wary of the visitors even though eighth-placed Swansea are four places and five points better off than Villa.

'They've got good players all over the pitch attacking-wise and it's a game where we have to be very much on our toes,' Monk said.

'Look at their last performance against Man United and I thought they probably deserved to win the game.

Monk was full of praise for Benteke but insisted that Bony was more effective at what he did 

'They've got a good squad and good players and they will be very dangerous, it's one we've got to be wary of.

'But the way we've played at home we've got to be confident of getting on the front foot and try to impose ourself on Aston Villa.

'There will be periods in the game where they will test us and we have to be ready for that, but confidence-wise we should be on all cylinders.'

Monk made seven changes for last weekend's 1-0 win at Hull and Leon Britton, Jefferson Montero and Gylfi Sigurdsson could all return after niggles but the Swansea boss admits there will be plenty of squad rotation over the festive programme.

Swansea hit the road after the Villa game with league trips to Liverpool and QPR preceding an FA Cup third-round tie at League Two strugglers Tranmere on January 3.

'Three away games over this period is a tough ask but that's why the squad is there,' Monk said.

'We have to be very strong mentally but I think mentally we're in a very good place - not just the games but between games and preparation-wise.

'You've got to be prepared for everything but the players know what's coming up, they've all been through it and realise what it takes.

'The result at Hull is a good start coming into these games and hopefully we'll get that performance level and some points over this period.'
