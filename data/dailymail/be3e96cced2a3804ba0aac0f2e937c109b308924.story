Whether it's sparked by a suspicious text messages on a partner's phone or a glance in a bar, we have all been struck by the green-eyed monster.

Scientists even discovered that the area of the brain which controls jealousy is the same part which detects real physical pain - perhaps 
explaining why feeling envious of your lover's philandering ways hurts 
so much.

But one doctor and his team think they have found the answer to this common woe in the form of  £6.65 mouth drops that claim to keep feelings of envy and jealousy at bay.

Green-eyed monster: Most people have experienced feelings of jealousy, spite and suspicion, and one doctor thinks he has the answer

Bach Original Flower Remedy Holly claims to help to manage negative emotions, so that you are able to 'focus on the future, rather than on your jealousy'.

The new product comes from the makers of Rescue Remedy, who use a system of flower essences which, they say, can help us rediscover the positive side of ourselves and lead emotionally healthy lives.

The key ingredient in their latest product is Holly, which the makers say is ideal for those who have feelings of extreme jealousy and/or are envious and suspicious, feel wounded, or want revenge.

The product, which is available in Boots and most health stores, claims that Holly is actually the remedy for very negative, aggressive feelings directed at others - feelings such as hatred, suspicion, envy, spite.

The basic problem is an absence of 
love, and the remedy apparently works to encourage our generosity of spirit and an 
openness towards others and is ideal for those who are sometimes attacked by thoughts of such kind as jealousy, envy, revenge, suspicion.

Dr
 Bach advises people who are suffering jealousy to place two drops 
directly on the tongue when they feel negative emotions arise.

His
 herbal remedy methods date back over 75 years, and many of the plants 
used originate from the Bach Centre garden in rural Oxfordshire.

Speaking about the product, Elouise Bauskis, Naturopath, Herbalist & Nutritional Therapist at The NutriCentre, said: Although we cannot give any assurance of jealously and envy disappearing, it is worth trying out flower essences for a gentle way to work through emotional "issues".

'Flower essences have been used for centuries to address emotional "issues" with much success.

'Many flower essences have been used the world over, from the Bach Flowers, to the essences made by Australian Aboriginals, who were among the first to discover the therapeutic value of flower essences as effective emotional "healers".

'Holly is a Bach flower essence that is specific for feelings of the green-eyed monster, and all kinds of strongly negative emotions such as hatred, revenge and suspicion. You may need to take this essence for a while to work through it, though it’s also worthwhile to look deeper as to why these feelings exist in the first place, maybe from a lack of confidence or self-love.

'Another alternative is the Confidence Boost by Flower Essences of Australia from The NutriCentre to enhance your confidence and courage, especially if you’ve had feelings of low self-esteem or lack of self-worth.'

Place two drops on your tongue (it can be diluted with water if you prefer)

Ideal to use if you experience pangs of jealously or spite

Holly works to calm us down and uplift our mood making us more open to others
