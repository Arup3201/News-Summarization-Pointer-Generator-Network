'Irresistible': Sex offender Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25, allegedly had trysts with two civilian workers at the Hillsboro, Oregon, jail identified as Brett Robinson, 32, and 38-year-old Jill Curry

The Washington County Sheriff's Office has now named the inmate who allegedly had sex with two female jail employees, as more details are beginning to emerge about the lovers' illicit encounters.

Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25, has been linked to two civilian jail services workers at the Hillsboro jail identified as Brett Robinson, 32, and 38-year-old Jill Curry.

The inmate's name was first made public Thursday by the station KPTV.  

Robinson was arrested earlier this week on multiple counts of custodial sexual misconduct after officials learned of her alleged affair with the inmate while investigating Jill Curry.

The 38-year-old veteran jail worker, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, was arrested last month on similar charges stemming from her alleged tryst with Mr Delgado-Galban.

According to court documents released to The Oregonian Wednesday, Mrs Curry repeatedly released the inmate out of his cell inside the jail's maximum security unit, walked him to a supply closet and had sex with him.

Investigators said they have obtained videos showing the married woman entering the closet with Delgado-Galban on several occasions.

It remains unknown at this time whether Ms Robinson also used the same closet for her sexual encounters with Delgado-Galban.

An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her.

The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped.

In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release.

But according to sheriff's officials, the man failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Robinson and Curry.

On Wednesday, Sheriff Pat Garrett had some harsh words for his two former staffers.

‘They didn't cross the line; they torched it,’ Garrett said.

In the wake of the scandal, Garrett said his department has added surveillance cameras inside the jail and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.

Brett Robinson, 32, was arrested Tuesday after a grand jury indicted her on charges of custodial sexual misconduct. She was later released after posting $12,000 bail.

The revelation comes about a month after Jill Curry's arraignment on similar charges.

The Oregonian reported that both women worked as civilian jail service technicians whose duties included booking and control room operations.

The Washington County sheriff's office said it is reviewing jail operations in light of the allegations against its staff.

A spokesman, Sgt. Bob Ray, said Curry and Robinson did not know about one another's contact with the inmate.

The jail holds 572 inmates and has a staff of 180 corrections deputies and civilian workers.

Jill Curry, 38, was arrested July 16 on charges of first-degree custodial misconduct with an inmate.

During her arraignment three weeks later, the long-time jail employee was charged with more than two dozen criminal counts, including identity theft. She pleaded not guilty and is due back in court next Monday, reported Hillsboro Tribune.

The 38-year-old woman has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004. Curry's indictment stated that the jail staffer had sex numerous time with the inmate in question between May 25 and July 3.

Mrs Curry is married to a sheriff's deputy, who has since filed for divorce.

According to officials, the allegations against Brett Robinson came to light as a result of the Curry investigation. 

‘I consider allegations that involve a second Jail staff member in this case extraordinarily serious,’ said Sheriff Garrett. ‘Addressing these issues demands immediate changes and a thorough, holistic review of protocols within the jail. Both efforts are under way. ‘

Robinson, who has been working at the jail since January 2013, was placed on administrative leave July 30. The following day, she was placed on unpaid leave based on the facts of the case.

The sheriff's office has been tight-lipped about the details of the investigations concerning Curry and Robinson, declining to specify where and under what circumstances the alleged sexual encounters took place.

The name of the inmate at the center of the controversy has not been released, but sheriff's officials revealed that he is facing a slew of charges in connection to four separate cases.

The unidentified suspect, who is listed as a victim in the probes of the two jail employees, is accused of failing to register as a sex offender; tempering with a witness; sexual harassment and second-degree assault.
