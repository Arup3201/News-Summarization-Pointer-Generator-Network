When a high school senior from Flourton, Philadelphia asked Shaun White to prom she never thought her wish would come true. Not only did the Olympic snowboarder attend her prom, he played a live show at the event with his band Bad Things.

Carly Monzo, a student at an all-girls Catholic school called Mount St. Joseph Academy learned that Shaun White had never attended his own prom before and therefore decided to make an epic video to ask him to hers.

Using a camera by GoPro, one of White's Sponsors, she filmed herself reading a witty poem and then posted the clip on Vimeo.

The poem read, 'Roses are red, violets are blue, My name is Carly Monzo, but I'm sure you had no clue. I'm currently a senior @ an all girls school. So when it comes to dates there's no boy pool.'

'I have a six-foot rule & I know you're 5'9" but I can overlook that 'cuz DAMN you're FINE.'

After seeing the video, White decided he'd be Monzo's date but he kept his prom appearance a secret with some help from the school who fully supported his attendance.

'I didn't know that Shaun would be there until they dropped the curtain on the stage,' Monzo told The Philadelphia Daily News about her surprise.

'The dean of students called my name and I thought, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' I mean, I've spent time in her office, but it's usually for uniforms things.'

Monzo had a wonderful time with her dream-come-true prom sate snowboarder Shaun White

When asked if Shaun was a good prom date, Monzo told reporters that he went beyond her expectations.

'He just pulled out the dance moves,' Monzo said.

'I thought he was going to have trouble keeping up with me but I was like, 'I can't keep up with this.'

Monzo even got a kiss on the cheek from her favorite celebrity and danced on stage behind him while he played with his band.Monzo originally had another date lined up for the prom but he didn't mind when she ditched him for White as his band's performance was mind-blowing for the entire school.

Like Shaun White, Monzo is also an athlete. She will be attending Loyola University Maryland to play basketball and she'll definitely have a good story to tell her teammates.
