A pediatrician who is an eminent researcher in near-death experiences in children has been accused of 'waterboarding' his 11-year-old daughter as punishment while his wife stood by and watched.

Dr Melvin Morse, a published author who has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King, allegedly held the girl's face under a running faucet on four occasions for as long as five minutes.

Authorities were alerted to the alleged abuse at the Sussex, Delaware home after a neighbour called police to say Morse had dragged the girl by her ankles across their driveway and spanked her.

Officials arrested Morse, 58, after the incident on July 12 but he was released on $750 bail.

On August 6, the girl was interviewed at the Child Advocacy Center and talked about a punishment her father called 'waterboarding', the Delaware State Police told The News Journal in Delaware.

She said he held her under faucets in the kitchen, bathroom and bathtub so the water would shoot up her nose, in a known torture tactic that simulates the sensation of drowning.

Her mother, Pauline Morse, 40, watched but did nothing to help, she said.

Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over someone's face, simulating the sensation of drowning. A cloth is often placed over the captive's face so their breathing is restricted for up to 40 seconds as water is continually poured onto them.

It dates back to the Spanish Inquisition, when it was a preferred interrogation technique as it leaves no marks on the person's body.

The practice can cause extreme pain and distress, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, long-lasting psychological damage and death. It can also cause broken bones as the captive attempts to escape.

In 2007, it emerged that the CIA had waterboarded three Al-Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003. The Bush administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of torture.

In 2009, President Obama banned its use, but the Department of Defense has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops.

Once, her
father said he 'was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so 
that she could not move', she said. Another time he allegedly told her 
she 'could go five minutes without brain damage'.

The girl added that Morse would 
'sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he 
would lose track of time and she would die'.

After the alleged torture, she would 'go outside and cry', but Morse would come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand, according to court documents.

'He would tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape,' police noted. 'He would not let go until she lost feeling and 
collapsed to the ground.'

The girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened.

Her five-year-old sister was also interviewed and said that, although she witnessed the abuse to her sister, she was never targeted 'because she is too young for it', The News Journal reported.

The abuse allegedly took place between 2009 and 2011.

Morse and his wife were arrested for the second time on August 7 and both face charges of reckless endangerment, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child.

Morse was being held in the Sussex Correctional Institution on $14,500 bail, while Pauline Morse was released on the same amount.

Both have been ordered to have no contact with their two children, who are being cared for by the local Division of Family Services.

The
state Attorney General’s Office filed a motion on Wednesday for the 
emergency suspension of Morse’s medical license. He works at a private pediatric practice in Milton.

He also specialises in near-death 
experiences in children and has co-authored a handful of books on the 
subject including Closer to the Light in 1991 and Transformed by the 
Light in 1992.

'In
hundreds of interviews with children who had once been declared 
clinically dead, Dr. Morse found that children too young to have 
absorbed our adult views and ideas of death, share first-hand accounts 
of out-of-body travel, telepathic communication and encounters with dead
friends and relatives,' one book review reads.

Research: He has written the above books after interviewing children declared clinically dead

Morse was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and
Larry King about the subject, as well as on radio shows and ABC's 20/20.

He runs a nonprofit organization 
called The Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness.

Pauline Morse lists herself as a researcher and the treasurer at the institute on her Facebook page.

On her page on Wednesday, she wrote: 'I do not wish to talk. I am extremely shy and I'm very upset and want to just be alone so I can gather myself together. Thank you for understanding.'
