Wealthy residents on the millionaire's row of Sandbanks were today planning to boycott a Tesco store which is set to open in the high-class neighbourhood.

The supermarket giant unveiled its plans to turn a pub on the sandy peninsula in Poole Harbour, Dorset, into a store last year, which sparked uproar from horrified locals.

Aghast residents said the store would look 'like a filling in a set of teeth' and thought a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be more suited to the affluent area.

Change: The supermarket chain is able to convert the Sandacres pub into a shop without planning permission

A petition was started in a bid to stop the convenience shop opening in Sandbanks, which is the fourth most expensive area in the world to live.

But Tesco have now revealed that they are continuing with the controversial plans, and the store is expected to open in July.

Under development rights regulations, the supermarket chain is able to convert the Sandacres pub into a shop without planning permission.

It did submit four applications for minor changes, which include a cash point, shop frontage, cycle stands, 6ft fencing, new windows and air conditioning units.

Around 425 people have signed the 
campaign against the shop, which states that residents are 'far from 
happy to be next to and/or looking out on to a Tesco Express’.

Some of the well-heeled residents think 
the blue and red logo will be too garish for the upmarket location and 
others are concerned about additional noise and traffic.

Peter Oliver, the manager of the Cafe 
Shore eatery on Sandbanks, said: ‘Having a Tesco here with their bright 
logo is going to be a real eyesore.

‘It's going to look like a filling in a
set of teeth. A Marks and Spencer would have been much better suited to
the area and would have blended in well.

‘I don't drive so the store would be useful but I'd rather have something that looked nice instead of a logo that stands out from a mile away.

‘Everyone is saying the same thing and I don't think many people will be happy about it.’

Ross Stallion, a 36-year-old sales 
director from neighbouring Canford Cliffs, said: ‘The area could do with
a convenience store but a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be better
suited.’

The petition was started by Karen Denham who owns nearby newsagent Sandbanks Stores and believes resident's views have been 'totally ignored'.

She said: ‘I believe local people will boycott it, a lot of my regulars here have already said they will not use it.’

A spokesman for Tesco said: ‘We think it will be really handy for people who are looking for a sandwich, are looking to add something extra to their picnic and for those who need to top up their weekly shop with a few extra essentials.’

Sandbanks is known for its multi-million pound harbour-front mansions. Its high profile residents include Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden.
