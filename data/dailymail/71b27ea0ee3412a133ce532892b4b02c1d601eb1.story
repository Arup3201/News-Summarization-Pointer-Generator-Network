A mother has been left devastated after a 12-week scan revealed her unborn baby already faces a fight for survival - because his heart is growing outside of his body.

Samantha Kerr, 33, was delighted when she became pregnant just months after a miscarriage.

But the excitement soon turned to worry after her 12 week scan showed the baby boy's heart protruding from his chest.

The baby has been diagnosed with ectopia cordis, an extremely rare condition which affects just eight in one million births. 

Mrs Kerr was devastated when her 12 week scan revealed her baby was growing with his heart protruding from his chest. She has decided not to have an abortion and has named her son Gabriel, which means 'miracle'

The baby has been diagnosed with ectopia cordis, an extremely rare condition which affects just eight in one million births. The condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen, although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a fracture in the breastbone

Despite the problems ahead Mrs Kerr and husband Dennis, 34, of Maidstone, Kent, have rejected an abortion and Mrs Kerr is determined to have her son.

A mother-of-two already, she  has already named the child Gabriel, as it means miracle.

But doctors have warned his chances of survival are slim, with 90 per cent of babies with the condition are stillborn or die within three days.

Even if Gabriel does survive he faces dozens of operations to rebuild his chest, which have only proved successful for a few babies in the past.

Mrs Kerr, a teaching assistant, said: 'We were given the decision to terminate the pregnancy or continue with it, whatever we decided it was going to be heart-breaking.

'He is moving around and is as alive as he can be and for that reason I didn't want to take a decision on his future into my own hands. We just wanted to give him the chance.

'We were told it is a very high risk pregnancy and there are concerns as to whether the baby will make it.

'There are not that many success stories and that's why we are praying for a miracle.'

Mrs Kerr and binman Dennis, who married last Saturday, are nervously anticipating the due date of April 17 but have been told they need to wait to see how the baby develops in the coming weeks.

In the 12 week scan Gabriel's arms, legs and head can be clearly seen - alongside a heart protruding from his chest.

Mrs Kerr, who has two teenage children with a previous partner, now has a string of appointments at her local hospital and with specialists at King's College Hospital in London.

Ectopia cordis is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside the chest.

The condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen, although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a fracture in the breastbone.

Incredibly rare, the condition affects only eight in every one million births, with 90 per cent of these babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days - usually through infection, hypoxemia (an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood), or cardiac failure.

Although the exact cause is unknown, ectopia cordis is thought to be related to problems with the development of the baby's 'lateral plate mesoderm', the middle layer of the embryo, in early pregnancy.

The development of the muscles that hold the baby's organs in place fails, leading to them bursting through barely developed muscle and bone, and continuing to grow outside the skin.

She said: 'He is our little miracle and we are willing him to survive.

'We love him already and we will pray for a miracle. That is all we can do.

'I would give my life for him to be healthy. I think that is what a mother would do for her children.'

She added: 'We were told because of our age there was a high chance we could terminate and have a healthy child in the future.

'But we have not just signed up for a healthy child, we have signed up for a baby and this is what we have been given.'

Mr and Mrs Kerr are now trying to find other families who have had babies with the condition.

Mrs Kerr said: 'We have found a family in Texas online who have had a success story and have contacted them on Facebook but have not heard back from them.'

A King's College Hospital NHS Trust spokesman said: 'Ectopia cordis is a rare and extremely serious condition.

'We have discussed the various treatment options with Samantha, and we are providing her with all the information, help and support she needs.

'Whichever choice she makes, we have said we will support her decision, and provide all the appropriate care and treatment.'

Dr Gurleen Sharland, a consultant in foetal cardiology at Evelina London hospital, said: 'Ectopia cordis is caused by a defect in the chest wall which can lead to the heart being completely or partially outside the body.

'Sometimes babies suffering from the complication may also be born with other external organs which makes survival more unlikely.

'The condition requires surgery if the baby is to survive but sometimes this is difficult as the heart has developed so long outside the body that the chest is too small to accommodate it.'
