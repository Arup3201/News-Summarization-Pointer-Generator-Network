As we all sat eagerly awaiting the Premier League’s big-hitters to make their moves on Deadline Day there was a flurry of activity in the Football League, as is always the case.

For all 72 clubs January is anxious time as managers wait to see whether their star names will be plucked by the big boys in the top flight - every player has their price.

The roles will reverse next month when sides in the Championship, League One and League Two will do battle to feed off the scraps of Premier League squads.

With the 25-man squad ruling in place dozens of quality players will be available on loan and managers and chairmen know that to acquire their services on a temporary basis could be the difference between mid-table and promotion, relegation and safety.

But as focus switches abruptly away from the transfer market and to this weekend's fixtures, who were the major winners and losers during the January window? 

It is increasingly looking like a four-horse race for the two automatic promotion places in the Championship and, despite Jordon Ibe’s recall by Liverpool early last month, Derby have stolen a march on Bournemouth, Middlesbrough and Ipswich during the transfer window.

Steve McClaren has added experience and depth to his squad in the form of England internationals Darren Bent and Stephen Warnock while the Deadline Day loan additions of wingers Tom Ince and Jesse Lingard should more than cover for the loss of Ibe.

League leaders Bournemouth failed in their month-long chase of Birmingham’s highly-rated winger Demarai Gray, with a final £5million bid turned down on Monday, but manager Eddie Howe will be pleased to have not lost any of his talented young squad to Premier League poachers and has extended the loan deal of Southampton goalkeeper Artur Boruc to the end of the season.

Boro boss Aitor Karanka, Jose Mourinho's former No 2 at Real Madrid, used his strong relationship with the Chelsea boss to his club's advantage again by bringing in Czech international defender Tomas Kalas on loan. Kalas makes it three Stamford Bridge loanees at the Riverside, with forward Patrick Bamford and defender Kenneth Omeruo having joined on season-long deals in the summer.

Adam Forshaw has also arrived from Wigan and will link up with Lee Tomlin in Karanka's midfield - Tomlin remaining on Teesside despite teasing Boro fans on Deadline Day on Twitter by suggesting he was off to Leicester, before revealing it was all a joke.

It was a quiet month for Ipswich but again Mick McCarthy will be pleased to have kept his promotion-chasing squad together, while improving it with the relatively low-key additions of veteran goalkeeper Paddy Kenny and former West Ham forward Freddie Sears.

Wolves, seventh in the Championship, deserve a special mention. Just 18 months after inheriting a bloated and disillusioned squad in utter disarray, Kenny Jackett has managed to move on several more of his outcasts while continuing to develop a talented young squad with the addition of Benik Afobe. They will be quietly confident of reaching the play-offs.

In League One, it looks like three will go in to two for the automatic promotion places with Bristol City leading the way from MK Dons and Swindon.

MK Dons had a mixed window with Dele Alli's £5m move to Tottenham and subsequent loaning back for the rest of the season summing it up rather nicely. They lost Afobe, who had been on loan from Arsenal, to Wolves, but Devante Cole's two goals in the 5-0 over Crewe last weekend suggest the Manchester City loanee, son of former Manchester United striker Andrew, can fill the void.

Jonson Clarke-Harris also boosts their striking options while Keith Andrews returns to stadium:MK to add some experience for their promotion chase.

Swindon, one of the stories of the season, will be delighted to have had none of their youngsters poached by bigger clubs. There was little activity coming in at the County Ground in January but a squad whose oldest player (by a long way) is only 28 can only get better.

Bristol City have made a few shrewd loan signings but will lose striker Matt Smith back to Fulham in March. They will be hoping his goals will have promotion all but sewn up by then.

In League Two, leaders Shrewsbury have made a statement of intent by bringing in Tyrone Barnett on a two-and-a-half year deal from Peterborough, while Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink has used his European contacts to improve second-placed Burton's squad.

You can expect those two to continue to set the pace but all that can change, as in the Championship and League One too, when loans are allowed again next month.

Window open or closed, the transfer market never sleeps.

Talent scout: Sheyi Ojo (Wigan, on loan from Liverpool)

With so many youngsters making temporary moves from the Premier League to the Football League it really is a case of ‘take your pick’, but it will be interesting to follow Ojo’s progress over the next few months. 

The England youth winger made headlines in 2011 after a protracted transfer saga saw him move to Anfield from MK Dons, whose academy have also produced new Spurs signing Delle Alli. 

Chelsea were also said to be interested in Ojo before that move and it looks as though the 17-year-old will be given his chance to shine by Latics manager Malky Mackay, who has waxed lyrical about the latest addition to his squad.
