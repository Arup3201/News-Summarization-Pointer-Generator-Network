Inter Milan loan signing Lukas Podolski has revealed that he doesn't care about the criticism that has been directed at him regarding his recent performances, insisting it is part and parcel of the game.

The 29-year-old has flattered to deceive since joining the Italian giants from Arsenal, most recently being named the second-worst Serie A capture of January in a poll conducted by Gazzetta dello Sport.

The Germany international is yet to open his account for Roberto Mancini's side either - despite making nine appearances in all - although he is not phased about the criticism he has been receiving as a result of that.

He told Sport1: You need to swallow [criticism] in professional football. There is always another direction, meaning a positive one.

'I don't care for media or people being critical of me. I know that this is part of the business. It's important to know what you have to do to be better.

'The folks always want to see you hit rock bottom though.'

The former Bayern Munich forward has also come under pressure from the Inter fans, who booed him after he was substituted in the 1-0 defeat against Fiorentina on Sunday.

Inter boss Mancini has also had his say recently commenting on the German: 'Podolski must do more. What he's doing is not enough and he's the first to recognise that.'
