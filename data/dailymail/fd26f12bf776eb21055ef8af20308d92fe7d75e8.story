A mother is desperately battling to raise the $60,000 needed to fly her and her premature daughter home to Australia from Fiji, after she unexpectedly gave birth in the back of a taxi on a street in Nadi, last week.

Jayne and Ashley Wren weren't expecting to be parents until July, so they did not have travel insurance that covered their baby being born while they were on holiday.

Maddison Jayne Cazna Wren arrived early at 33 weeks at 1.7kg and remains in an incubator at Nadi Hospital.

The couple flew to Fiji for a wedding after being granted full permission by doctors in Sydney.

An online campaign has been launched to help bring baby Maddi home and cover the medical expenses for the newborn.

The night after the wedding, Mrs Wren was on her way to a check up at a local private clinic in Nadi but her destination quickly changed to Nadi Hospital when she went into labour in the taxi.

The new parents now have growing financial concerns but are being helped significantly by the online campaign set up through fund-raising website mycause.

'Jay was carried from the taxi her baby was born, on a local street in Nadi,' wrote Angela Allison who is running the campaign.

The father of Maddison, Ashley Wren, was a groomsman at his friend's wedding in Nadi and wasn't expecting to be a father so soon

'Conditions [at the hospital] are far from the standards we are used to here in Australia,' said Ms Allison.

'With not even a blanket for Maddi or clothes for her to wear, Jay and Ash are beside themselves with worry and stress.'

Ms Allison told Daily Mail Australia, however, that they have been overwhelmed by support from friends, family and strangers.

'Now that a few Aussie celebs have retweeted we are gaining donations from strangers,' she said.

'Initially it was just friends and family of Ash and Jay and people who read about it via the shared Facebook link. It's so exciting to watch the amount raise and to think about how much this is going to mean for them.'

An online campaign was launched to pay the $60,000 to bring Maddi home

Medical expenses, accommodation and flights for the baby won't be covered by travel insurance. The campaign has raised $26,000 but needs to raise $60,000
