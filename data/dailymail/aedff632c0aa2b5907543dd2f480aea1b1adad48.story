Alastair Cook faces D-Day over his future as England captain this week, with calls growing for him to resign before he is sacked.

The 29-year-old has endured a torrid time with the bat in recent months, is without a Test hundred in 26 innings and has averaged less than 24 over the past year. His captaincy style has also been heavily criticised as England have slumped to a string of humiliating defeats.

Insiders insist that the captain retains the support of the dressing room, and senior ECB figures have much to lose if he flops after they backed him following this winter’s Ashes debacle while sacking Kevin Pietersen. But with his batting technique in disarray and his leadership style under intense scrutiny, Cook must decide this week if he wants to carry on.

D-Day: England captain Alastair Cook must lead his side to victory with a big score against India to keep his job

Woes: Cook has struggled with the bat for more than a year and needs to find form in the second Test at Lord's

‘The worst thing he could do is drag his heels and be stubborn,’ one former England captain told Sportsmail on Saturday.

‘Sometimes in life you just have to accept something is not for you. It’s not looking good for him.’

Cook is likely to have to bat at some point on Sunday in England’s second innings in the Lord’s Test against India. An unlikely victory, with runs from the left-handed opener, would probably buy Cook some time, but defeat and another low score would make his position almost untenable following the 5-0 Ashes humiliation and last month’s home series defeat by Sri Lanka.

Huge questions would also need to be asked of Peter Moores, who has so far failed to make a visible impact on England’s performances in his second incarnation as head coach. But for the time being the focus remains on Cook.

Alastair Cook will be glad to see the back of 2014, a year which has seen his England captaincy called into serious question. The opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and, as his team toils against India at Lord’s, Sportsmail takes a look at where it all went wrong:

January

Questions begin to be asked over Cook’s captaincy as England lose the Ashes series in Australia 5-0.

January

Cook captains England in the ODI series but is unable to make a big contribution as England lose 4-1.

January

England coach Andy Flower resigns but under-fire Cook vows to continue as captain and is backed by the ECB.

February

Fall-out from Ashes continues as the ECB axe batsman Kevin Pietersen effectively ending his England career.

May

Cook’s mentor Graham Gooch is sacked as England batting coach — on the captain’s advice.

June

More doubts are raised over Cook’s captaincy as the opener is dismissed for just 17 in the first Test against Sri Lanka. He scores only 28 in the second innings, before making just 17 and 16 in the second Test.

July

Dismissed for just five runs in the first Test against India at Trent Bridge, before getting out for only 10 in the first innings of secondTest.

Nervous times: Cook could find his position untenable if England continue their poor form against India

Pondering: England coach Peter Moores stuck with Cook when he took over but must make a decision now

Looking behind: Cook must find his form again if he is to retain his captaincy - and his place in the England side

One England team insider told Sportsmail on Saturday that the Essex opener remains in good spirits around the dressing room, refusing to allow his own struggles outwardly to affect his mood. It is understood he went out of his way to take newcomer Gary Ballance out for dinner last Wednesday in an effort to reassure him about his future after pictures emerged of the 24-year-old cavorting drunkenly in a Nottingham nightclub upon the conclusion of last week’s Trent Bridge Test.

‘Gary’s a very sensitive young man and he was extremely worried about the implications of the pictures being publicised,’ the insider said.

‘Cooky made it his priority to make sure Gary didn’t have dinner on his own the night the pictures came out. He has not got to the stage where he’s so worried about his own form that he’s stopped thinking about his players.’

But although Cook retains the support of the dressing room and those close to it, there are worrying signs that senior figures at the ECB are beginning to distance themselves from him.

On Saturday, England team managing director Paul Downton, the man responsible for sacking Pietersen after taking over from Hugh Morris, declined to support Cook publicly, and ECB chairman Giles Clarke reacted angrily when approached by journalists.

The ECB do not have a track record of sacking captains, with Alec Stewart being the last to lose his job for on-field reasons in 1999 (although Pietersen was sacked following a behind-the-scenes fall out with Moores in 2009), but defeat at Lord’s would leave Cook facing the axe.

‘It’s a position I recognise,’ said former England captain Mike Brearley on Friday. ‘My record was rather like Alastair Cook’s since he got the last of his 25 hundreds. You feel awful, you begin to doubt and need a lot of support around you.’

No doubt Cook has that support, but he also has his detractors and those who fear the end is nigh. One of those is his former team-mate and close friend Graeme Swann, whose resignation mid-series against Australia arguably did more damage to Cook’s long-term captaincy ambitions than his lack of creativity over field positions or predictable bowling changes.

‘I feel very deflated for Cook,’ said Swann. ‘I feel for him as a mate. Hopefully he’ll get a second chance in the match. I hope nothing crazy happens but I think everything is coming to a head.’

Cook was adamant he would not resign after defeat at Headingley last month saw England lose a home series to Sri Lanka for the first time. Friends at Essex also insist he is ‘not the resigning type’.

But defeat at Lord’s on Sunday, and a failure to score runs, would leave Cook with nowhere to turn.
