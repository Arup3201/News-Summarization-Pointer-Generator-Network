A married father of two-year-old twin boys that collapsed and died while playing cricket at Lord's, tragically died of natural causes.

Philip Standing, 30, had just bowled his second over at the seven-a-side team-building session with colleagues from Lloyds Bank and LPG law firm when he sat down, feeling unwell.

Moments later the accountant from Caterham, Surrey fell off his chair face first and began convulsing on June 28 at the indoor centre at the famous cricket grounds in St John's Wood, London.

Family left behind: Philip Standing, right, died of natural causes at Lord's indoor cricket centre, leaving behind his wife Kate Standing, left, and two-year-old twin boys Ben and Oliver, centre

Despite being treated by paramedics, doctors and friends he died in hospital just over an hour later.

A post-mortem found that Mr Standing, who was largely healthy and loved sport, suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and had a history of high cholesterol.

At Westminster Coroner’s Court, colleague Brenda Fleming said in her witness statement that the match had been ‘light-heated,’ and ‘not very energetic.’

She said: ‘Philip had recently bowled his second over and moved around the field to change position before he left the field to sit down.

‘Although the hall was very warm this seemed unusual because the game was not very energetic.

'Only moments before leaving the field he was chatting and joking and had not shown any signs of feeling unwell.

‘Someone gave him a bottle of water 
but before he managed to drink it he dropped it and fell face-first off 
the chair he was sitting on. He fell face-first and did not use his arms
to stop him.

‘He was convulsing... he was breathing and groaning at this point.’

At the hearing: Mr Standing's family, including his wife, second from left, and his mother Sue Standing, third from left, heard how his post-mortem revealed he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and had a history of high cholesterol levels

His teammates put him in the recovery position and called 999 while one attempted CPR.

Ms Fleming said blood was on his lips and that he improved slightly after chest compressions were performed but ‘zoned out’ shortly afterwards.

Paramedic James Chapman said Mr Standing had no pulse and was not breathing. He and colleagues performed CPR and used a defibrillator on him as they drove to St Mary’s Hospital, West London.

His teammates followed in a taxi, but Mr Standing died before they arrived at the hospital.

Accident and Emergency Doctor Julian Redhead said a team of medics treated Mr Standing who was suffering a heart attack when he arrived at hospital.

He said: ‘Unfortunately the attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was declared to have died at 7:55pm.’

Coroner Jean Harkin ruled a verdict of 
death by natural causes. She paid tribute to Mr Standing, describing him
as ‘a young, well-liked, very sporty man who loved sport and was 
playing it when he had a cardiac event’.

Bonding session: Mr Standing was rushed to St Mary's Hospital after the 'light-hearted' cricket game at the indoor centre at Lord's Cricket Ground, pictured, but died just over an hour after he collapsed

She said: ‘It is a very tragic loss of life. The cause of death given is heart disease, as a result of (a coronary artery problem) and hypercholesterolemia.’

His GP, a Dr Corey described Mr Standing as ‘slightly overweight’ and that his cholesterol was slightly higher than average at 7.1 in January this year but that he had declined drugs to treat it and brought it down to 6.04 by May.

A microscopic examination of his heart during the post-mortem showed that showed areas of inflammation and a plaque build-up.

A report by pathologist Dr Michael Osborn described Mr Standing as suffering from a ‘sudden cardiac death due to coronary artery disease’.

He said: ‘He has a history of hypercholesterolemia, which is significant.’

Westminster coroner’s officer, Kim Bedwell, said Mr Standing met wife Kate while studying at Warwickshire University in Coventry, where he obtained a first class degree in maths.

The pair married in 2007 and Mrs Standing gave birth to twin boys in 2010.

Ms Bedwell said: ‘From an early age he developed a love of all sport. He was a good all-rounder but his favourite sport was football, something which played a very big part in his life.

‘Philip achieved a lot in his short life and will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, innate modesty and sense of style.’

He then climbed the corporate ladder at top firms KPMG and Ernst and Young, before being seconded to Lloyds banking group in 2012.
