Chelsea stars Willian and Filipe Luis celebrated their birthdays on board an airplane as the club jetted to Hungary as part of their pre-season preparations.

In a gesture that would no doubt be appreciated by Yaya Toure, the Blues posted happy birthday messages accompanied by pictures of the pair on their Twitter account.

Other players also joined in the celebrations with Cesc Fabregas posting a birthday selfie with Luis and Diego Costa, while Willian's Brazil teammate Fernandinho sent a Facebook picture of the pair with the message: 'Happy birthday brow (sic),God bless you on this special day...health, happiness and much peace to your life.'

Willian, 26, and new signing Luis, 29, are part of the squad travelling to face Ferencvaros in Budapest on Sunday before returning to Stamford Bridge for a final pre-sesaon game against Real Sociedad. 

Jose Mourinho's side had mixed success in their last pre-season outing - an Istanbul  tournament in memory of the Soma mining disaster - where they beat Fenerbahce before losing late on to Besiktas in two 45-minute matches.

Costa started both games and the £32million hitman scored a brilliant goal against Fenerbahce, beating four defenders to open the scoring before Branislav Ivanovic added a second.

A defeat to Besiktas through Ersan Gulum's late goal denied them the title though as Besiktas came out on top.
