Actress and comedienne Betty White has opened up on the subject of romance in an interview with New You Magazine.

The 92-year-old Golden Girls star, who has been married three times in total, was asked if there was anything she would change about her life.

'To bring Allen [Ludden] back,' she says. 'And I wish I didn't have two bad marriages. They were probably my fault.'

Oops: Comedienne Betty White, 92, has admitted that her first two failed marriages were 'probably' her fault, largely because she chose the wrong men, she theorizes

Ms White, who lost her last husband Allen Ludden to stomach cancer in 1981, added: 'I had lovely relationships, but not anything in the league of Allen.'

She attributed her previous failed marriages to not marrying 'the right men'; namely U.S. Army pilot Dick Barker in 1945 and then Hollywood agent Lane Allen in 1947.

In 1961, the legendary comic, who spoofed Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball video last year at the age of 91, finally found the man of her dreams in Mr Ludden, who she would stay married to for almost 20 years

Third time lucky: Ms White (left, in 1962) turned down at least two marriage proposals from Mr Ludden (right) before marrying him in 1963 and staying with him until his death almost 20 years later

Enduring love: Following his death from stomach cancer in 1981, Ms White (right) implied she would never marry again, saying to Larry King that 'once you've had the best, who needs the rest?'

The couple met when Ms White appeared on Mr Allen's game show as a celebrity guest, and, after two years of dating and two rejected marriage proposals, Ms White finally accepted and the pair were married.

Following her husband's tragic death, the star admitted to Larry King that she wouldn't remarry. 'Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?' she said.

Asked by New You magazine what she thought of women dating much younger men, and whether she might consider it herself, she joked:

'If they want to be a cougar that’s fine by me. I’m an animal lover.

'But I would always feel so insecure if I was with a much younger man. I would think, "I’m getting older and he’s not!"'

Wendie Malick, her co-star in hit TV series Hot in Cleveland, indicated in a separate interview that Ms White was in fact far from insecure about her age.

'She has taught us all that when you turn 60 you’re starting your third act', she attests.

'[Betty] always comes in with a smile, is always ready to go, and gives it her all with grace and humor.'

And according to a report today from Styleite, even the late Queen Elizabeth was a fan of her work. So much so that the Queen Mother, who died in 2002, requested a live performance of Golden Girls in 1988.

'It was very exciting. The Queen was lovely,' Ms White said on Reddit. 'We were told not to address her unless we were addressed. She was up in a box and she came down on stage after with Princess Anne.'
