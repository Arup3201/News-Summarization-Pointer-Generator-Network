Three hundred passengers and crew were still on the sinking cruise ship Concordia as its captain made his escape, the official report on the tragedy has revealed.

Among other damning revelations in the 176-page dossier is that the coastguard were not alerted to the incident until they were phoned by a passenger’s mother.

Half an hour after the collision, Captain Francesco Schettino had yet to put out a distress signal.

Captain Francesco Schettino was at the command of the cruise liner in January 2012 when it hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany and sank, killing 32 people

But by this time a mother of one of 
the passengers had informed police of an accident, after receiving a 
call saying that the ship was in blackout, a ceiling had collapsed and 
those on board were putting on their life jackets.

Some 32 people died when the Costa 
Cruises liner ran aground off the Italian island of Giglio in January 
last year, hours after leaving Civitavecchia on the first leg of a 
cruise round the Mediterranean.

A catalogue of errors by 53-year-old 
Schettino are documented in the dossier into the disaster by the Italian
 maritime authorities.

The captain caused the collision by 
sailing too fast, too close to shore, and he was distracted by people 
who had no business on the bridge, it found.

He had failed to consult large-scale 
maps, and used the wrong landmark on the island to turn the ship. He 
then delayed sounding the general alarm, and when he did eventually 
speak to the coastguard, downplayed the seriousness of  the incident.

Passengers and crew were left to their fate by the captain of the cruise ship Concordia, the official report on the tragedy has revealed, while 80 were still fighting for their lives as the sea-master stood safely on shore

The report appears to demolish 
Schettino’s claim that he saved thousands of lives by steering the ship 
into shore, saying the crash caused the rudder to fail. Instead, a 
detailed chronology reveals how he left his 4,228 passengers to fend for
 themselves.

At 9.45pm, the ship ran aground at a 
rate of 16 knots. As the rocks tore a 150ft gash in the ship’s  belly, 
the loud scrape and subsequent blackout made it obvious to everyone on 
board that something was very wrong. Five watertight compartments were 
immediately submerged, meaning the ship was doomed.

But it took another 31 minutes for 
Schettino to alert the authorities and it was not until an hour after 
impact that the order to abandon ship was given. At 11.19pm, with 300 
passengers and crew still on board, the captain and officers abandoned 
the bridge.

Shortly afterwards, when coastguard officials called Schettino’s mobile phone, he had already slipped onto a lifeboat.

Schettino (centre) faces 20 years in prison for his part in the maritime disaster off the island off Giglio. Others were also at fault, the report found

He was ordered to return to his 
vessel but continued towards shore. By the time he reached Giglio, 80 
passengers and crew were still struggling to stay alive on the sinking 
vessel.

Human error is ‘the root cause  of 
the Costa Concordia casualty’, the report concludes, much of  it the 
‘inadequacy’ of the ship’s command and Schettino’s ‘unconventional 
behaviour’.

But others were also at fault, the 
report found. Members of the bridge team are said to have been 
‘passive’, neglecting to question the captain’s actions and warn him of 
the impending impact.

The report is not intended to be used in judicial proceedings but comes just in time for Schettino’s trial in July.

The former seaman faces 20 years in 
prison for his part in the maritime disaster, considered Italy’s worst 
since the Second World War.
