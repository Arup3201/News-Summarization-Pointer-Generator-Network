In a statement that should be of interest to Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard has claimed Liverpool's famous 4-0 win against Real Madrid in 2009 was due to the aggression showed by their outstanding centre-forward on the night, Fernando Torres.

Although current Champions League holders Real are favourites at Anfield on Wednesday night, one factor in Liverpool's favour is their last European clash – which The Reds won 5-0 on aggregate in the last-16 of the competition.

Gerrard scored twice in the Anfield romp and Torres and Andrea Dossena were also on target for Rafa Benitez's side in a humiliation for the Spanish side that prompted them to go out and spend £80million on Cristiano Ronaldo the following summer.

Gerrard said the win was all thanks to the aggression shown by their outstanding centre-forward on the night

'The reason we came out on top that night was because we were very aggressive with and without the ball,' said Gerrard.

'We pressed from the front and had a world-class talent there in Fernando Torres. He set the tempo up front and we all came behind him. We forced Real Madrid into mistakes.'

His comments will surely interest Balotelli who has struck a lethargic figure in a disappointing start to his Anfield career.

Manager Brendan Rodgers has a big choice whether to stick with the Italian after he fluffed more chances at QPR on Sunday but for now the Liverpool boss is trying to encourage his £16million striker, who is needed with Luis Suarez gone and Daniel Sturridge injured for a further month.

'Mario was of course disappointed at the weekend. He is a goalscorer and wants to score. But I have highlighted to him he is getting into the positions. As long as he is in there with the possibility to score, I have every confidence he will score.

'Of course he has scored important goals in big games in his career so I am sure if selected he will have a good chance of doing that for us.'

Gerrard isn't expecting a repeat of the 4-0 scoreline on one of Anfield's great European nights.

'With all respect to their 2009 team, Real Madrid have progressed and improved since then. We have huge respect for the new Real Madrid.

'I can't give out any of our tactical secrets but we will have to be at our best individually and collectively.

'We are now back in the Champions League so I am not sure Real Madrid will come in with any fear. They will come in with confidence - I don't think there are many they worry about facing.

The Liverpool striker missed a golden opportunity during Sunday's narrow victory at Loftus Road on Sunday

Despite fluffing his lines on numerous occasions this season, Gerrard is confident goals will come for Balotelli

'But for us this is a fantastic challenge. We are trying to improve, it is almost like a bonus game for us. But I know you only enjoy nights like this if we put in a good performance. We'd like to shock a few people tomorrow night.

'Everyone knows what this club is about and the history. It is very important to keep Champions League football here for as long as we can.

'It was a wonderful evening for myself and the team in 2009. We are looking for a similar level of performance tomororow night. Nights like that live with you forever. When giants come into town like Real Madrid and you get the result, it makes for fantastic memories.'
