While Australians may have earned a reputation as avid travellers, staggering figures show we are a nation of hard workers with millions of accrued annual leave days.

As a result, this impacts mental health of employees which costs Australian workplaces nearly $11 billion every year.

The Happiness Institute CEO Dr Timothy Sharp, or as he likes to call himself - 'the chief happiness officer', says not taking frequent holidays can have serious negative consequences on one's overall well-being.

Research released by Fiji Airways revealed half a million Australians haven't left the country in recent years while 10 million don't even own a passport

'The bottom line is that we need to rest,' Dr Sharp told Daily Mail Australia.

'Otherwise we will burn out which in technical terms can cause depression, exhaustion or anxiety - that's in a worse case scenario.

'Taking a break can be a powerful source of happiness.'

Research released by Fiji Airways suggests that Australians are not taking the time to simply 'switch off'. 

Consequently, the yearly impact of untreated depression in the workplace includes over 6 million working days in Australia and 12 million days of reduced productivity.

The effect of not addressing mental health in the workplace is costing $4.7 billion in absenteeism, $6.1 billion in presenteeism and $145.9 million in compensation claims. This is a total of $10.9 billion a year.  

Research also found about 470,000 Australians choose to stay home instead of exploring the wonders of the world while Australian workers have 128 million days of annual built up and 10 million people don't have passports.

Among those Australians include 23-year-old Jordan Pedron, who's never left the country.

The Newcastle resident, northeast of Sydney, was only 19 when she boarded her first domestic flight.

The Happiness Institute's CEO Dr Timothy Sharp says it's important that we take frequent breaks from work

Ms Pedron says she'd love to travel but she just hasn't had the time and money for it.

'Mum was a single parent and always drummed into me and my two older sisters that family was important,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'So family has always been priority for me and the last few years I've used my holidays to visit them for weddings, birthdays or other important events.

'That's why I guess I put everything on the back pedal, including travelling overseas.'

CEO of The Happiness Institute Dr Timothy Sharp says the key to a happy life is to maintain quality, deep and meaningful relationships.

'Undoubtedly, at any age of life it is important that we maintain good relationships that will help enhance long jeopardy and health,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I'm not talking about have hundreds of Facebook friends or hundreds of Instagram followers. It's about keeping in touch with our loved ones and having quality relationships that's worth putting time and effort into.

'This will give us a meaning and purpose to our life.' 

Other ways to keep a happy life-style include:

Ms Pedron, who's originally from Dubbo - northwest of Sydney, doesn't regret spending time with her family but she hopes to take some time for herself sooner rather than later.

'I haven't been able to go away for ages so I'd love to be on an island, or even experience running with the bulls or a white Christmas,' she said.

'But I'll have to save for that and hope that one day it happens.'

While Dr Sharp acknowledges that money can't buy happiness, he says it's important that Australians invest in positive experiences which will help create long-term happiness.

'Of course it depends on person to person but leaving the country will help refresh us, break the routine which will stimulate our minds,' he said.

'It's also important to take regular short breaks throughout the year instead of taking a good long break at once a year.' 

In light of the research, Fiji Airways has launched a world wide search for people who have not yet had a chance to expand their horizons overseas.
