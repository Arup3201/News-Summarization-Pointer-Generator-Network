Mauricio Pochettino will leave no room for sentiment when solving his goalkeeping dilemma for Tottenham's Capital One Cup final against Chelsea.

Michael Vorm has started all of Tottenham's games on their charge to Wembley, but Pochettino must balance that loyalty against the risks of leaving Hugo Lloris, one of the world's finest goalkeepers, on the bench.

Pochettino promised that only cold judgement would be applied in his selection, which he claimed would not be known by the players until Saturday or Sunday morning before heading to the stadium.

But the former Swansea keeper may be dropped for the final against Chelsea on Sunday 

He said: 'In each game and every game I take a decision and analyse which is the best side to pick.

'Those who get left out need to be kept on board for the rest of the season though. The players know that only 18 players can be in the squad and only 11 can start. It's not a different rule for the final.

'The players, like on the first day, need to understand that I am the boss. I decide the squad, I decide the starting XI and I decide who plays and who does not.

Tottenham manager Maurico Pochettino could opt to start his first-choice keeper Hugo Lloris instead 

Pochettino said the players had to understand that he was the manager and he picks the team

'It is true that it is a final and an important game but the players need to accept my decision.'

Pochettino's selection in Thursday's Europa League exit against Fiorentina saw Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Ryan Mason left on the bench. All are understood to be in line to start against Chelsea.

Pochettino, who was on Espanyol's bench for their 2006 Copa del Rey final win, added: 'When you are in football and you are a player, when you sign the contract it is for training, for your best in that and after you have to wait for the decision of the manager.'
