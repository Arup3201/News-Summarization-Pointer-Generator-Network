After a few washout summers, this year saw a settled June followed by a July heatwave and a sunny August.

So it comes as no surprise that the summer of 2013 has been our warmest, driest and sunniest for seven years, according to the Met Office.

And as the season draws to a close today, the good news is that the balmy weather looks set to continue into autumn.

autumn, according to forecasters

Hot stuff: While the 19-day July heatwave stood 
out as the most striking weather event of the season, a Met Office 
report said it was 'more notable for its duration than the actual 
temperatures recorded'

Although temperatures will cool down over the weekend, the mercury could rise to as high as 28C (82.4F) in the South East and East Anglia next week.

The Met Office has revealed that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK was 15.2C (59F) – just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006.

A total of 189mm of rainfall was measured, 78 per cent of the UK average and half last summer’s total of 379mm.

In 2006, 188.3mm of rain was recorded, along with 601.5 hours of clear sunshine that was not blocked by any cloud.

That compares to 588 hours this summer, making it the seventh sunniest summertime since 1929.

was 15.2C (59F) - just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006

But in a statement released yesterday, the Met Office said: ‘While this summer is warmer, drier and sunnier than the long-term average, it hasn’t been exceptional.

‘It stands out because the last six summers have been wetter than average, with 2012 and 2007 both being in the top five wettest, and 2008 and 2009 also in the top ten wettest in records from 1910.’

And while the 19-day July heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season, the report said it was ‘more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded’.

The summer’s highest temperature was not during the heatwave but on August 1, when the mercury reached 34.1C (93F) at Heathrow – the highest in the UK since July 2006.

Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: ‘We’ve had the kind of summer we should have had, rather than the wet and cooler summers we have suffered in recent years.

‘There will be plenty of fine, dry weather for the south and South East next week - certainly warmer than normal for this time of the year. It could reach around 25C (77F)early in the week and perhaps a little warmer later next week.

'But it will only be a brief sunny interlude, with conditions becoming more unsettled and temperatures back to normal by the end of the week.’

The unseasonal temperatures will be caused by an area of high pressure dominating England and Wales which will draw in warmer air from the continent.

MeteoGroup forecaster Alexi Boothman predicted temperatures of 27C (80.6F) in the South East on Wednesday, with the possibility it could go higher the following day.

She added: ‘The average temperature for the start of autumn in the South is 20C-21C (68F-69.8F) so it will be a good few degrees higher than average. But in the north temperatures could be up to ten degrees lower, much closer to the seasonal average in that part of the country.’

The Met Office said this summer was likely to finish around eighth to tenth warmest since 1910.
