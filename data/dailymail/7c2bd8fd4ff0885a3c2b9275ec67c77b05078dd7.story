An elderly couple have been left seriously injured after a vicious attack by a suspected burglar in their quiet, cul-de-sac home. 

Eric and Joyce Davey remain in hospital with throat and head injuries respectively after being attacked in their home in Scunthorpe, north Lincolnshire, yesterday afternoon.

The couple, aged 90 and 86, were discovered after neighbours saw a man fleeing their property in a white van. 

A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

'This was a vicious attack on two elderly and vulnerable members of the community in their own home,' said Detective Inspector Jon Cross.

While it is believed the couple were assaulted by the man attempting to burgle them, it is not known whether or not the man stole anything from the property.  

'It is believed they were assaulted by the man who was attempting to burgle them,' a Humberside Police spokesman said. 

'At this time it is not known whether anything was stolen.' 

Neighbours described their shock that such a violent attack could take place in such a quiet area. 

'It’s just a small community street. When things like this happen, you just can’t believe it,' said Martin Sloan.

'I hope all the best for them. I hope everything’s OK.' 

Officers were called to the home in Scunthorpe following reports of a man fleeing the property in a white van

Mr Sloan added the couple do not interact with neighbours much, but had lots of security installed at their house. 

'I thought it was a car alarm further down the street but, as it progressed, we understand that it was the alarm on his house.

'We saw them come out. It didn’t look very good. 

'It’s unbelievable. You wouldn’t think something like this would happen on this street. Definitely not.

'I know everybody on this street. It’s quite a shock really to find out that something like this has happened.'

'They kept themselves to themselves, basically. We keep ourselves to ourselves. But we still look out for people.

'He’s got CCTV all over the place and I don’t really know what’s happened.

'It’s a very, very quiet street. It’s a very quiet area. It’s a good area. It’s quite shocking to hear what’s gone on.'  

Another neighbour, Suzanne Cowling, said: 'Nobody deserves that in their own home. It’s not right.'
