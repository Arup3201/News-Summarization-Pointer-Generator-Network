The Kate effect has struck again as the Topshop dress she wore today quickly became a sell out.

The dress was available to buy from the High Street chain's online store this morning, but within an hour of the Duchess of Cambridge stepping out in the polka dot garment it was out of stock.

Bargain hunting fashionistas rushed to buy the £38 dress that fits Kate even though she's currently six months pregnant.

Baby on board: At six months pregnant, Kate's baby bump is obvious but she doesn't have to wear maternity clothes yet

The Duchess teamed the black and white dress with a black Ralph Lauren jacket as she toured the Warner Bros film studios with Princes William and Harry.

Kate, 31, has long been a fan of Topshop and has been seen in clothes from the British brand on numerous previous occasions.

Just last month, Kate wore a £46 black shift dress from the store with a white Peter Pan collar as she attended the headquarters of Child Bereavement UK with her husband.

The Duchess, who is due to give birth in July, was spotted browsing the rails of one of the store's London branches at the beginning of March.

On that occasion, she was rumoured to 
have bought a short floral print dress called 'Deirdre' that she has yet
to be seen wearing in public.

Today isn't the first time Kate has caused a spike in sales at Topshop. Back in 2007, long before she was the Duchess, she was still making her mark as a style icon.

When she was pictured out in a black and white patterned tunic from the store it flew off the shelves.

Her sister, Pippa, is well-known for sharing her sense of style and she's also regularly seen in Topshop garments. While another high profile fan of the brand is Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears.

But Topshop isn't the only High Street store Kate champions. She also regularly wears clothes from Reiss, LK Bennett and Zara.
