Police officers in a California town recently had to smash a car window to free a black bear that had locked itself into a Honda SUV and ruined the inside.

But it's far from the only trapped-bear incident that's taken place in Truckee, near Lake Tahoe.

More pictures have emerged of bears that have managed to climb inside cars and the subsequent damage they've caused.

It’s thought that the creatures climb inside the cars to look for food.

Local police are urging residents to be more careful about locking their cars to prevent further cases of this happening.

'Bears can and do open unlocked car doors,' police said. 'Never leave food or anything smelly in your car.'

No injuries have been reported to either animals or humans, but considerable damage has been cause to the vehicles. While the police freed the bear that had climbed into the Honda, in other cases the vehicle owners had to free the bears themselves.

In all cases the bears ran off into the woods around Truckee, a small community of about 16,000 people close to the Nevada city of Reno.

Meanwhile, in Russian, hungry bears have become a motorway hazard for drivers along a stretch of road where the animals are begging for food.

While the bears approach cars and wait for their next drive-by meal, motorists are throwing out treats to the animals along the highway which links the oil-rich cities of Khanty-Mansiysk to Tyumen in the remote region of Uvatsky.

But police are warning people not to feed the brown bears because they are at risk of being attacked when they unwind their car windows. 

Sergey Zaitsev, head of the village Gornopravdinsk, which is close to the spot where the animals gather to grab their grub, said it is sometimes impossible for drivers to pass because there are so many animals on the road.

He said: 'Bears are attracted by the easy food, which the truck drivers share with them.

'Just yesterday I threw cans of sweet condensed milk and tins of meat to a bear with cubs.'

Locals have even started naming the animals and the fastest cub has become known as Piston.
