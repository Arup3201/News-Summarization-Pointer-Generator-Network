An alleged car thief faces further charges after trying to escape police custody through a hospital ceiling tile.

The Albuquerque Journal reports that 34-year-old Shylen Salazar from New Mexico received medical attention after  swallowing a batch of drugs on her original arrest last Tuesday.

During her hospital stay she apparently got into the roof and crawled 75 feet from her bed before being discovered.

It took police around an hour to locate her.

Salazar is now facing charges for possessing a stolen vehicle, possessing drugs and escaping from police custody. 

She was arrested last week along with another man when they were found near a stolen car.

When she was put in a holding cell, Salazar started hyperventilating and paramedics were called.

She told officers she had swallowed drugs, and a pipe was found in her bra, according to the court documents. 

It was while she was being treated at Presbyterian Hospital that she decided to make a bid for freedom.

It wasn't known if she had an attorney.
