A football mad father-of-one who underwent a sex change following an attempt to cut off his own penis with a Stanley knife has said that he now appreciates football for an entirely different reason! 

Kirsty Cass, 51, used to be a Manchester United-obsessed macho man called Andy who enjoyed nothing better than watching a game with a few beers.

However following a bungled DIY sex operation - where Andy tried to cut his own penis off - she is now a woman following a successful procedure on the NHS in 2011.

Kirsty, of Crawley, West Sussex, admits her transformation had a strange side effect, reporting she doesn’t enjoy football anymore but instead fancies the players - with her favourite pin up Manchester United's star Robin Van Persie.

Kirsty said: 'I used to go to Old Trafford all the time. Being a football fan and going to matches was part of trying to be one of the boys.

'The other day at work I had to ask a colleague what the match result was from the night before - back then I would have known exactly what it was.

Kristy says now rather than enjoying the game of football, she is more interested in Robin Van Persie (right)

'I don’t have even a ladies Manchester United shirt - I buy blouses in shops like Jane Norman now.

'I follow them casually, but I am more interested in the good looking players like Robin Van Persie - he’s a bit of alright.

'I used to be all Manu - but there is only one Persie I’m interested in now.'

Kirsty is now successfully living as a woman after her sex change and says she has never been happier- but has no idea what is going on with Man United

Nowadays Kristy is more likely to be seen in a  Jane Norman blouse or mini skirt than a football shirt

Kirsty once almost died after drunkenly trying to chop-off Andy's manhood off with a craft knife.She
recalled: 'The pain was unbelievable. It took a couple of minutes 
before I quickly sobered-up. I grabbed a hankie and tried to stem to 
stem the bleeding and dialed 999.

'I
don’t remember what happened next, just waking up in hospital and 
realising my penis was still there. Doctors explained they had to 
reattach it.'

Kirsty wore women’s clothes for years to prove she was serious about the £12,000 operation and changed her name by deed poll.

Kristy says even as a child she knew something was different

Following surgery earlier this year at a clinic in Charing Cross, central London, Kirsty has started dating men.

She said: 'I always tried to be one of the boys, but I knew from a young age I had been born in the wrong body.

'At primary school there were two sheds that the kids used to play in. There was one for the girls and one for the boys and I would always be in the girls one.

'I used to have girlfriends - but only because that is what the other boys did. I would drink pints and look at girls to fit in.

'The other boys would be looking at girls in a sexual way but I would be thinking about how their outfits would look on me.'

Kirsty was married to Linda Woodhouse, 45, and they had a daughter Jodie, now 23, but realised she was living a lie just six years after she was born.

She said: 'Now, I feel fantastic. It feels so natural. I ooze confidence - I am so happy with how I look.

'I have lost some friends on the way, but I have gained better ones. I am taking an optimistic view of life.'
