Two shoplifters have been arrested after they allegedly stole items from a Home Goods store ... before immediately trying to exchange them for store credit.

Dominika Johnson, 25, and Kendra Hill, 28, were arrested in Moraga, San Francisco, are accused of taking their haul straight to the customer service desk and demanding an in-store gift card in return for the goods which they'd pinched moments earlier.

But their plan was allegedly foiled when an eagle-eyed staff member recognised Johnson for having pulled the exact same stunt twice in the past two weeks.

Officers were called to the store and Johnson was arrested on suspicion of burglary, conspiracy, receiving stolen property, probation violation and outstanding arrest warrants for grand theft and traffic violations.

Hill was also arrested on suspicion of burglary and conspiracy, as well as child endangerment after officers found children in her car outside.

Police said the children were unharmed and released to a relative's 
custody. Police did not say how many children were there, how old they 
are or what their relation to the two women was.

Johnson had been identified as doing the same thing on March 31, April 3 and again on April 5, police added.

Both were booked into the County Jail in Martinez.
