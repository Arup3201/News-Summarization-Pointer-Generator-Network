When Wing Commander Paul Bingham Elwell spotted five German planes flying over the French coastline in he must have feared the worst.

But the brave RAF pilot gave chase and opened fire on the enemy Focke-Wulf aircraft as they desperately tried to flee in 1944.

Despite being heavily outnumbered, the 34-year-old managed to shoot down one of the planes and probably a second one.

Wing Commander Elwell only abandoned his onslaught over the Cherbourg peninsula in northern France when his Mosquito ran out of ammunition.

He had been sent to investigate flares and flak in a routine operation when he spotted the enemy planes.

In recognition of his valour, the skilled aviator was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

A local newspaper report in the 
Swindon Advertiser at the time of the incident noted Wing Commander 
Elwell’s bravery under the headline ‘Fought Five Planes - Highworth 
Pilot Gets One’.

The report 
said: 'Investigating flares and heavy flak east of the Cherbourg 
Peninsula, a 34-year-old Mosquito pilot, Squadron Leader P B Elwell, 
Highworth, noticed five FW-190s climbing steeply.

'He raced in and fought the planes until his ammunition was exhausted. He destroyed one FW for certain, and probably another, before returning home safely.'

Although he survived the war, Wing Commander Elwell tragically died aged 52 when he crashed his de Havilland Dragon Rapide  at Entebbe Airport in Uganda in October 1962.

He suffered a heart attack as he came in to land.

Now, more than 40 years later, his son John Elwell, 64, has taken the difficult decision to sell his father's medals at auction to support his own son.

The money will be used to buy land in Australia.

The set, which also included the
39-45 War medal, 39-45 Star, Atlantic Star and Africa Star, sold for 
£6,566 at auction to a private British collector.

The
sale also included a medallion awarded by the Belgian government, 
epaulettes and cloth wings, flight logs, newspaper cuttings and a 
personal diary.

Following the war Wing Commander Elwell continued flying and in 1960 was made an MBE for helping evacuate European refugees from the Belgian Congo during the country’s revolution.

Philip Allwood, from auctioneers Moore Allen and Innocent in Cirenester, Glos, said: 'Wing Commander Elwell served throughout the Second World War with distinction.

'After the war he carried on being very couragous, airlifting people out of the Congo.

'Sadly he died shortly after at the controls of a plane.

'Auctions like these just go to highlight the incredible stories of bravery and valour that would otherwise remain unknown.'

Born in 1910 in Highworth near Swindon, Wg Cdr Elwell began flying in 1932 following an apprenticeship as an engineer at the Great Western Railway Works.

He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1939, continuing to fly fighter planes until the end of the war 1945. After the war he continued to fly for commercial carriers in Africa.

Between 1955 and 1960 Wg Cdr Elwell worked in Kenya where he was the second mayor of Eldoret, a town in the west of the country.

He then moved to Uganda where, while working for Caspair Air Charters, he trained the first ever African pilot.

War effort: Wing Commander Paul Bingham Elwell was flying a Royal Air Force De Havilland Mosquito like this one in 1944 when he spotted five German Focke-Wulf planes and gave chase

Wing Commander Paul Bingham Elwell was at the controls of a de Hallivand Mosquito when he bravely chased five German bombers over France in 1944.

The plane - dubbed The Wooden Wonder because it was made almost entirely from wood - was one of the fastest aircraft in the world when it was first manufactured in 1941.

It was used to intercept Luftwaffe planes launching night raids on Britain. They were also used to drop 4,000lb bombs on Germany which the Nazis were unable to prevent because of the speed of the planes.

In total, 7,781 of the planes were manufactured. They were also used by the Australian, US and Canadian Air Forces. The Mosquito could fly at over 400mph.
