Four Sri Lankan athletes were stopped by police after cycling down the M74 motorway on Wednesday.

The cyclists were pulled over near the exit for Motherwell and Hamilton and advised to ‘get off the road’.

A similar episode occurred in Manchester in 2002 when two Kenyans cycled 17 miles down the M61 before being stopped by police near Bolton.

Sally Pearson is set to pull out of the 100 metres as she does not want to risk her fitness for her specialist event, the 100m hurdles.

The Australian, the Olympic and Commonwealth champion over the hurdles, has recovered from a hamstring problem and will focus on defending her title. ‘It’s probably more likely that I am going to pull out,’ she said.

Three-time world champion Wendy Houvenaghel has retired from cycling and fired a parting shot at the sport.

The 39-year-old, who misses the Commonwealths through injury, was controversially left out of Britain’s team pursuit line up at the London Olympic Games and will now work as a dentist. ‘It is a profession where, as a woman in my thirties, I’ll be treated as equal,’ she said.

Harry Aikines-Aryeetey is confident there will be three Englishmen in the 100 metres final at the Commonwealth Games — and all have a medal chance. The absence of Usain Bolt is set to make for a more open field and Aikines-Aryeetey believes he and team-mates Adam Gemili and Richard Kilty can challenge for the podium.

Aikines-Aryeetey said: ‘I’d like to say that we’re going to have three in the final.

‘Myself, Richard and Adam are definitely good enough.’

Canada’s Nic Hamilton has been forced out of the Commonwealth Games track cycling events after crashing into an official. Hamilton suffered concussion while the Glasgow 2014 official suffered a suspected broken collarbone.

The velodrome had to be closed for 30 minutes, delaying a visit from the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. A Team Canada statement read: ‘Nic does not have any serious injuries other than his concussion.’
