Five of the BBC's most senior bosses were handed jobs with pay totalling £1.8million-a-year without  the roles ever being advertised, it was revealed today.

Lord Hall, who earns £450,000-a-year as Director General, did not have to apply for his job and then brought in several other executives in the same way.

The majority of his senior management team are also graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, with critics saying it shows the BBC is run by 'an old boys' network'.

Lord Hall was parachuted in after the Jimmy Savile scandal shook the corporation in 2012 but the Director General job was not advertised.

As a result of the Savile scandal, Helen Boaden was forced out of her previous job, head of BBC news because she dumped the Newsnight investigation into his abuse. She was appointed BBC radio chief instead on £352,900.

Lord Hall's former Royal Opera House colleague Anne Bulford was given the managing director for finance and operations on £395,000 without the job being advertised.

British employment law does not insist that businesses advertise jobs when they become available.

But critics believe this can end up discriminating against those who may be suitable. 

Or meaning that jobs can be handed out to friends or people from a particular group or background. 

The Equality and Human Rights Commission says: 'If an employer doesn’t advertise at all or advertises in a way that won’t reach people with a particular protected characteristic, this might in some situations lead to indirect discrimination, unless the employer can objectively justify their approach. 

'This is because not advertising or only advertising in a very limited way may stop people with a particular protected characteristic finding out about a job, which could count as worse treatment'.

And former cabinet minister James Purnell was offered the £295,000 job of director of strategy and digital have previously worked at the BBC as head of corporate planning from 1995 to 1997 under former director general Lord Birt, a friend of Lord Hall.

Tim Davie was acting director general during the Savile crisis and was then became CEO of BBC Worldwide and Director Global, on £400,000, earning £670,000 in total last year.

It came after it emerged the BBC pays 11 of its most senior bosses twice as much as the Prime Minister and a further 80 executives take home more than David Cameron’s £142,500-a-year salary. 

Conservative MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: 'The BBC is a self-serving old boys' network.

'The BBC has recently said they have cut their senior management to the bone and there are no more savings to be made there but it’s only at the BBC where you could cut senior management to the bone and end up with more people paid more than the Prime Minister than before you started.

‘It’s just extraordinary and goes to show how much fat there is.

‘What the BBC should do is be cutting out all of these managers, most of who if they disappeared no one would notice, and start delivering some value for money to the licence fee payer.’

Bosses: Helen Boaden was moved to Director of radio in the fallout of the Savile scandal while former Labour MP James Purnell was offered an unadvertised role

The BBC said today that it does sometimes not advertise posts to avoid expensive recruitment processes.

The spokesman added that one in three of all executives are Oxford or Cambridge graduates, which is lower than some other sectors.
