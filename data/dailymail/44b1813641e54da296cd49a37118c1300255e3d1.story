A reality TV star has spoken for the first time about terrifying encounter in a hotel room where she sexually assaulted by a stranger.

Tanya Bardsley, 33, who appears in ITVBe's The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and is married to Stoke City footballer Phil Bardsley, said she woke up to find a man touching her - and had no idea whether or not she had been raped.

The incident happened in March 2013 when the couple stayed in a hotel after attending a family birthday party. Tanya went to bed early leaving her husband to carrying on partying with his friends. 

The WAG said her husband, Stoke City footballer Phil Bardsley, pictured, has helped her come to terms with the incident which happened in March 2013

Ordeal: Real Housewives star Tanya said she woke up in a hotel room to find a strange man touching her

'Phil left the hotel room leaving me there in a drunken, comatose sleep. I woke up in a hazy state to find a strange man at the side of the bed touching me,' she told The Sun.

'I screamed for him to get out. I then rang Phil, who quickly came with a car full of friends and he rang the police. I was badly shaken up.'

Wigan-born Tanya was taken to hospital where she had a number of 'distressing' examinations to find out if she had been raped.

She said: 'Lucky for me, the tests came back that I hadn't been raped, just sexually assaulted. Thoughts kept going through my head - how many other girls might have been targeted?'

These thoughts led to mother-of-three Tanya to waive her right to anonymity as a victim of sexual assault by sharing her ordeal in her self-published book, Just A Girl Who Got It All.

Tanya, second from left with her Real Housewives of Cheshire co-stars, said she was 'badly shaken up' by the sexual assault which took place in 2013

The 33-year-old said she's angry and disgusted that there was not enough evidence to prosecute her attacker

She also worked with the police to have her attacker prosecuted - but nobody has been brought to justice due to a lack of evidence.

A man who worked at the hotel admitted he had been in Tanya's room while there was a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door.

Tanya said she felt 'sick' when she heard he had 'admitted to coming over and moving my sleeping naked body' during a police interview. But he denied committing sexual assault.

'Months went by waiting for the police to get forensics back and for the case to go to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if there was enough evidence to go to court,' Tanya explains.

'After five months of it hanging over my head, the CPS came back and said there wasn't enough evidence.'

Rags to riches: Tanya went from being a single mother working in a call centre to living in a £2.7million mansion after winning a modelling competition and marrying a footballer

Tanya said the decision left her feeling 'angry and disgusted that this man would get away scot-free.'

The mother-of-three, who has a daughter from a previous relationship and two sons with Phil, said her husband has been 'her rock' helping her come to terms with what happened. But she said it has taken time to move on. 

'At first I was angry and bitter... I had to keep reminding myself that my being angry was only harming me and those close to me... so I just had to let it go,' she said. 

Tanya's book reveals her rags to riches tale, going from being a was a single mother working in a call centre to a WAG living in a £2.7million mansion in Cheshire's affluent 'Golden Triangle.'

Cover girl: When Tanya appeared on the front of FHM magazine, her edition outsold Jennifer Lopez's

Reality TV: Tanya is one of the stars of ITVBe's new show about the women living in Cheshire's affluent 'Golden Triangle'

She met Scotland international Phil after becoming an FHM model - a role she won after submitting a picture of herself to their 'High Street Honeys' competition.

She writes in her book: 'I had always wanted to be a model travelling the world and being on the front cover of magazines, earning lots of money for my daughter Gabriella to have a nice life.'

She added:' I never believe I could become a model as I was 5ft 3 and I was sure there were millions of girls better looking.'

But after winning the FHM competition, her front cover outsold Jennifer Lopez's and she's regularly appeared in the magazine's 100 sexist women in the world list.

Now she's set to find greater fame on TV show The Real Housewives Of Cheshire, which started this week on ITVBe.
