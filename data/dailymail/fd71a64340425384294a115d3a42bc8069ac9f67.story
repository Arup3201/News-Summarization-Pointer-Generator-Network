If we believe what we're told by these broadcasting veterans, 'radio for grown-ups' is the way forward.

Former BBC Radio 1 host David Hamilton and Graham Dene, said to be Princess Diana’s favourite DJ when he was at Capital Radio, are behind a new service for the over-50s from charity Age UK.

The Wireless launched online in May but yesterday started broadcasting on DAB digital radio in London and Yorkshire, aiming to provide classic hits and advice on improving life for the elderly.

It aims to fill the gaps left by radio stations aimed at the elderly - such as SAGA Radio, which became Smooth Radio in 2007, and a predecessor, Melody Radio, which became Magic in 1998.

British stations aimed at the elderly are very rare, with Havant-based community station Angel Radio being one of the few examples, broadcasting to South Hampshire, reported Radio Today.

The Wireless broadcasts music from the Fifties to Eighties along with features, discussions and documentaries on issues such as sleep and blood pressure - and even genealogy research.

The station, which can now reach 12million people on DAB, has specialist programmes on genres including jazz, country, folk and classical, and gives advice on topics like saving energy and money.

Hamilton, who started his career for ABC TV in Manchester and later had a daily afternoon show simulcast on Radio 1 and Radio 2, is also the Fulham Football Club matchday host and announcer.

He said: ‘I’m really excited to be involved with The Wireless. It’s a brilliant new radio station that offers a unique selection of great music, interesting features and expert advice.

‘There’s a great selection of music from across the decades, some of which I remember better than others, so it really has something for everyone.’

Dene presented the breakfast show on Capital - when Princess Diana was said to have secretly joined him in the studio on one occasion in the Eighties - and he later worked for Virgin, Magic and Smooth Radio.

Age UK group chief executive Tom Wright CBE said at the station’s launch that people over 55 years old listen to radio more than any other age group, so the charity wanted to target this audience.

He added: ‘We are thrilled to launch an entertaining and informative new radio station that provides the UK’s older demographic with more choice about what they want to listen to.

‘The Wireless will provide an entertaining outlet that helps us to share some of our extensive information and advice on improving later life, as well as encouraging our supporters to get involved in our campaigning and fundraising.

‘We also want to hand the microphone over to people in later life, providing a platform for listeners to express their own views and help shape what content we produce and air.'
