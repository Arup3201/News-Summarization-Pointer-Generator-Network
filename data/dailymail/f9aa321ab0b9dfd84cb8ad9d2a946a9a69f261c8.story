Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino will not panic if there are no major additions to his squad during the January transfer window.

The Argentinian arrived at White Hart Lane in the summer following a successful stint as Southampton boss - with six new players also joining Spurs as Pochettino, as well as chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini, acquired the talent they felt could help them return to the Champions League.

After a shaky start to the campaign, Pochettino now has his side playing some good football and, with a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United and a Europa League tie against Fiorentina on the horizon, Spurs sit just four points outside the Barclays Premier League's top four.

United States international DeAndre Yedlin will link up with the squad in the new year after a deal was originally struck with his current club Seattle Sounders in August.

But the 21-year-old is likely to be one for the future and, although Pochettino has been linked with a string of central defenders, he insists he would be happy if he is left with his current crop come February 1.

'We have a lot of chats and have I told him all my thoughts,' Pochettino said of transfer window discussions with Levy.

'We have common sense, when the window opens in January we will start to decide but so far we are very happy with our squad.

'I am happy, it's not about if you sign or not. I'm happy here and I'm happy with our squad. I never put pressure (on the chairman).

Pochettino brought in six signings over the summer, including Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli

'We need to understand in football, when you are a head coach you need to try to explain to the chairman, sporting director, my thoughts and advice and then decide the best for the team.'

Pochettino's squad will certainly come under scrutiny in the days leading up to the opening of the transfer window with home games against Manchester United and Chelsea following a Boxing Day trip to bottom side Leicester.

But, with the potential of a fully-fit squad, it will be a good chance for the coach to show what strength he already has at his disposal - or indeed show the weaknesses that need improving with a dip into the transfer market.
