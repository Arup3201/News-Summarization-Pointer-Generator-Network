Child Protective Services removed the two older brothers of missing six-year-old Tuscon girl Isabel Celis from the care of their father Sergio on Friday after a consultation with police.

Julian and Sergio, aged 10 and 14 respectively, are now in the exclusive custody of their mother Becky, who does not live with their father.

Isabel was at her father's house on the night she disappeared last month.

Gone: Isabel Celis, 6, was reported missing by her father on the morning on April 21 after she was not found in her bed

'We just wanted CPS to come in and perform an assessment based on 
information from detectives,' Tuscon police lieutenant Fabian Pacheco told the
Arizona Daily Star.

Police have declined to provide any further details as to what brought them to this decision.

in a statement released on Friday, police emphasized that it 'is common practice for CPS to become involved in investigations regarding missing children.'

On Thursday, CPS personnel met with detectives and the family at 
police headquarters.

The state agency decided to put in place 'certain 
measures to ensure the continued welfare of the Celis children,' the 
news release states.

Hope: Investigators have said it is still possible that little Isabel will be found alive and brought home safely

Isabel Celis was reported missing by her father on the morning of April 21 after he went to wake her up for school, but did not find the girl in her bed.

According to police, a bedroom window was open and the screen was removed. The 6-year-old was last seen at around 11pm the night before when she was put to bed.

Investigators have not taken anyone in the Celis family off the suspect list. They also have not eliminated the possibility that the girl will eventually be found alive and brought home safely.

Isabel's parents have taken a lie detector test, but its results have not been made public.

After Isabel was reported missing, police interviewed 15 registered sex offenders in the neighbourhood.

Distraught: Isabel's parents, Sergio and Becky Celis, have made several emotional pleas for their daughter's safe return

Hunt: The investigation into Isabel's disappearance so far has cost the Tucson Police Department more than $1million

Acting on some of the 1,000 tips they have received so far, police have also searched homes in the family's neighbourhood, dug through a nearby landfill and scoured waterways and drainage systems in Tucson.

So far, the investigation that has involved 20 detectives and 30 staffers has cost the Tucson Police Department more than $1million, Gather has reported.

In the days after the disappearance, Isabel's parents have publicly spoken out several times, making emotional pleas for the safe return of the little girl.

â€˜Just please, please, to the person or persons who have Isabel, tell us what you want. We will do anything for her. We're looking for you, Isa,â€™ Sergio Celis said tearfully on one occasion.

Friends and co-workers of Becky Celis, who is a nurse, have distributed more than 250,000 fliers in the Tucson area and in Nogales, Arizona, in an effort to find the missing girl.

Sought: Isabel is 4 feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes, weighing about 44lbs

The search for Isabel has extended into the Mexican state of Sonora, where authorities have been circulating her photos

The
 search for Isabel has also extended into Mexico, where authorities in 
the state of Sonora have been circulating photos of the first-grader.

Police
began looking at the possibility that Isabel could have been taken 
there because of Tucson's close proximity to the border, Lieutenant Fabian 
Pacheco told ABC News last month.

Isabel is 4ft tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes. She weighs approximately 44lbs. She was last seen with her hair in two long braids. She is missing one front tooth and one bottom tooth.

In late April, police released surveillance video showing five men leaving a Tucson nightclub and walking past the Celis home on the 
night when Isabel vanished. Later, however, police determined that the footage was not connected to the case.

Now, authorities say they are reviewing hours of new footage that they have obtained in hopes that it will lead them to new clues.

Meanwhile, the 911 call that was made the day Isabel disappeared 
continues to be withheld from the public. It will be released after 
police remove some of the information in the call, according to the Arizona Daily Star.
