Apple has sent out invitations for a media event in San Francisco on March 9, about one month before the much-anticipated launch of the new Apple Watch.

The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time.

Chief Executive Tim Cook said last month that the company plans to launch the smartwatch in April.

The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time.

The watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple's first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad.

The firm is expected to overhaul its stores in order to show off the various combinations of watch available. 

Shares of Apple were up 88 cents at $129.67 on Thursday.

Earlier this month Tim Cook hit out at the sedentary lifestyle of many people, claiming that sitting is terrible for your health -and that the upcoming Apple Watch can help.

While addressing a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco, the Apple CEO said 'a lot of doctors believe sitting is the new cancer.'

Cook revealed he's been using his Apple smartwatch to remind him to get up and move every hour.

'If I sit for too long, it will actually tap me on the wrist to remind me to get up and move, because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer,' said Cook.

'Ten minutes before the hour, it will remind you to move. We have a lot of people using the Apple Watch at Apple, and ten minutes before the hour, suddenly they all get up and move. 

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list.

The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. 

Siri is also built into the Apple Watch.

'It took a little to get used to, but it's great.'

The $349 must-have gadget starts shipping in April. 

According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin'.

The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn.

Cook made the announcement just as Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion.

Shares rose 1.9 percent to close at $122.02, lifting Apple's market value to $710 billion, and making it the first company to hit the $700 billion milestone.

Cook, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, said Apple was hitting its stride.

'We've taken (the mobile operating system) iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life,' Cook said.

'We want one seamless kind of life.

'And so, I think that is huge for our future...We also did a lot of things to further our global footprint. And so, if you look at what we've done in China, we've opened more stores there.

'We've opened a lot more distribution there. Through the world, we've opened almost 20,000 new points of sale.

The widely anticipated first Apple 'wearable' will likely start shipping in April, Cook said

The U.S. tech giant recently posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark.

Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service.

Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. 

'We've opened 27 new Apple Stores, lot of flagship stores.'

Cook said Apple took some $50 billion in revenue in emerging markets over the past calendar year.

Brian White, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the leading tech company has even more room to grow.

'Given Apple's powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,' he said in a note to clients. 

'At the same time, we believe Apple's valuation has room to expand from depressed levels.'

Apple shares remain valued at reasonable levels, according to analysts, because of the whopping $18 billion quarterly profit reported recently by the iPhone and iPad maker.

Using the price-earnings ratio favored by Wall Street, Apple is valued at around 16 times its annual earnings, but Fitzgerald said the value was only around 10 times the projected earnings for the next fiscal year.

Apple is far ahead in market value from the number two company, oil giant Exxon Mobil, worth some $382 billion at the market close.

The record Apple quarterly profit -- on unprecedented revenue of $74.6 billion -- was driven by the sale of 74.5 million iPhones, well ahead of most analysts' expectations.

Analysts are also seeing expanded adoption of the Apple Pay system that enables customers to purchase items with a tap of their iPhone, and many predict strong demand for the Apple Watch set for release in April.

Separately, Apple agreed to commit $848 million for solar energy to power its data centers, according to a statement from First Solar, Inc.

Cook called the effort 'our biggest, boldest, and most ambitious project ever' and said it was part of Apple's commitment on clean energy and corporate responsibility.
