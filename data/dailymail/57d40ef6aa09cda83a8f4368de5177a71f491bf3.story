A former male teacher at the elite Miss Porter's school has been charged with sexual assault after alleged inappropriate contact with a female student.

Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 42, was arrested on Monday and charged with two counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of fourth-degree sexual assault in connection with one student. It is unclear if others were involved.

The physics teacher and track coach was arraigned on 
Tuesday at the Superior Court in Hartford.

Bail was set at half a million 
dollars and he remains in custody until his next court appearance which has been scheduled for April 9.

According to the police report, the charge relates to a school employee who has engaged in sexual conduct with a student.

Police have refused to reveal details about the nature of Rajkumar's arrest as the investigation is ongoing.

The offenses allegedly took place in May 2010, December 2011 and February last year.

In a statement to MailOnline, Miss Porter's School said that Joseph Rajkumar had been employed as a science teacher from August 2009 until March 4 this year.

Miss Porter's day and boarding school
was established in 1843 and is a small, private establishment with 306 
girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on 
the campus.

It takes pride in a vast array of 
extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater 
programs, pottery, painting and textile classes.

Tuition for this year costs $48,510 for boarding students and $38,510 for girls who attend day classes.

Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography.

The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens.

'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.'

Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947.

Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper.

Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include social Lilly Pulitzer and Dorothy Walker Bush - mother and grandmother to presidents George H.W. and George W Bush.
