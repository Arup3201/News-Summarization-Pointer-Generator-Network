The parents of a five-year-old Calgary boy who went missing with his grandparents more than a week ago insisted during a Thursday night vigil that there will be a positive outcome.

Nathan O’Brien and grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes were reported missing June 30 by Rod and Jennifer O'Brien - they have not been heard from since, but the parents will not give up hope.

'We’re very hopeful that they’re out there. There’s no doubt in our mind,' Jennifer O'Brien said between tears, according to the National Post.

Keeping hope: Rod O'Brien, and Jennifer O'Brien attend a candlelight vigil for Nathan O'Brien, 5, and his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes in Calgary, Alberta, Canada,  Thursday, July 10

'We’ve just got to find them and the police are doing everything they can do,' she continued. 'I’m hopeful in every way and we all are. I hope this turns out to be a happy story and I think it’s going to.'

About 500 people gathered for the vigil, according to the paper, They wore green ribbons, held candles and fought back tears during prayers and a moment of silence.

'I like to think of this whole thing as just a way to keep the flame going,' Jeff Liknes, Kathryn and Alvin’s son, told the assembled mass. 'I don’t want to think of this like a funeral because I know it’s not one. I’d love to see them again.'

The gathering came only days after police raided the suburban Alberfa farm of 54-year-old Douglas Garland and took him into custody for questioning.

He is believed to have been driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared - the one found by cops in his driveway when they arrived at his farm.

Police are said to be looking into a 
dispute over a business deal several years ago between Garland - who is 
related to the missing trio through a sister's comnon-law marriage - and
 Mr Alvin, according to the National Post.

Officers focused their hunt for the missing family members at three Airdrie locations on Monday.

One centered around a slough and a field near the home of Mr Garland's parents, Archie and Doreen Garland.

Garland once operated a drugs lab at the property which police searched over the weekend, court records showed.

After being questioned by police Garland was released the following day.

He
 was then remanded in custody for two days for possessing the 
identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car 
crash in 1980. He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment.

Garland
 made a brief appearance in court on Monday, via closed circuit 
television, and was remanded in custody for an additional 48 hours, in 
which time police could continue to interview him.

Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product.

Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years.

He
 was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the
 dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges.

Garland
 had used the fake identity to gain employment as a chemical mixer, but 
that ended in 1997 after a promotion led to him suffering a nervous 
breakdown.

He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed.

Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won.

His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009.

Monday's search involved forensics investigators and fire personnel who scoured a waterway in a rapid deployment craft.

Green
 ribbons have now appeared around the close-knit Airdire community, a 
symbol of hope that the trio will return home safe and sound.

On
 Friday Calgary police Staff Sgt. Doug Andrus spoke about the 
significance of locating the truck seen near Liknes family home on the 
night they disappeared.

Police swarmed on the Garland family farm after neighbours reported seeing the Ford F-150 there

He
 said: 'We just believe given the area the vehicle was in, and the fact 
that it was the night of the incident and that it drove in the area 
several times, that there's a good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have information.'

At
 the press conference police confirmed a 'violent crime happened in that
 residence', but said they remained hopeful 'we will find them alive'.

The
 missing boy's grandparents are not considered suspects as investigators
 found evidence that all three left the home against their will.

Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke of his beloved son last week.

He
 said: 'To whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off 
our little angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his 
brothers and his family.'

Jennifer O'Brien told her son to have courage.

She said: 'Stay strong, Nathan. We know you are our superhero and I just need you to stay strong and we are going to see you.

'We can't be with you right now, but the best people who can be with you other than us are your grandparents.

'I know Grandma is holding you so tight right now, and they are doing everything in their power to keep you safe.'

Mrs O'Brien last saw her son Sunday night, after helping her parents all day with a garage sale.

She left her parents home around 10pm and Nathan stayed behind to have a sleepover. When she returned 12 hours later in the morning, all three were gone.

An Amber Alert was issued for Nathan later that evening.

Investigators
 have not said much about what they found in the home, but there is a 
visible 8-meter-long drag mark of what looks to be recently cleaned up dark liquid that runs from the home's side door to the driveway.

Inspector Keith Cain said: 'We have a big mystery on our hands right now, we don’t know where these people are.'
