She may have just played an all-powerful matriarch, but Helen McCrory isn't about to get hung up on how old she is.

The 45-year-old star of the gangland drama Peaky Blinders says women who worry too much about their age and appearance have too much time on their hands.

In an interview yesterday, the wife of Homeland actor Damian Lewis, 43, said many women were 'obsessed' with their weight and changing looks.

Instead, McCrory, who has also appeared in The Queen, Harry Potter and Skyfall, praised her parents for bringing her up with a sense that 'things like that just don't matter' and that her looks should never determine her self-worth.

The mother-of-two, who lives in north London, told The Sunday Times Magazine: 'My attitude to ageing is all down to them. Never once did my mother comment on how another woman looked; she never said I was too skinny or too fat.

'Things like that just didn't matter! So many women are obsessed with their age and how they look. I just think: "Sorry love, but you've obviously got too much time on your hands".

'Thanks to mum and dad, my self-worth is not tied up with how old I am or how much I weigh.'

Speaking last year, the London-born star admitted she started taking riskier roles once she hit her forties.

She said: 'People go on about me getting these Mrs Robinson parts I keep saying to Damian, you're cast with a woman half your age, and nobody mentions it in the script.

'I only have to look at a younger man and the whole f***ing drama is about it. 'My god, there's a woman with a job and she's looking at a man half her age.'Â
