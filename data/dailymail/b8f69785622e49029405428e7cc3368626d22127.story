A bodybuilder threatened to kill is weightlifting ex-girlfriend after she posted pictures online with her new flame, court papers show.

Shadie Assad, 29, was so enraged when he saw photos of bodybuilding former girlfriend Jill Livoti and her new beau Capriese Murray, that he contacted her with hostile text messages.

'Not once did you post pics of me and you,' Assad said to Livoti, 43, in a text message from September, court papers show.

Livoti had posted pictures of herself and Capriese Murray online, and Assad was upset because she had never posted pictures of the two of them together

Livoti took out an order of protection against Assad in Manhattan Family Court when the couple, pictured here in May 2014, broke up

He threatened that the couple should 'enjoy it while it lasts' because he planned on 'ending it one way or another', according to the New York Post. 

'I swear don't let me catch you in the street. I'll bust your face wide open!' Assad said in another text. 

'Dead you and Capriese are dead,' he wrote. 

Assad left Murray a racist voice mail in addition to the messages, court papers show.

He also 'stated that she better leave New York because the defendant was going to come for her and said if the cops are there, they're going to need the SWAT team,' according to court complaint records.

Assad was arraigned on September 6 on felony criminal-contempt and other charges after being busted for the threatening messages. 

Capriese Murray, Livoti's new flame, also received a racist voicemail from Assad, court records show

Assad was given a no-jail plea deal in court on March 18 and agreed to take the New Start stalker program. The judge ordered a full order of protection against Livoti and Murray

His lawyer, however, argued that Assad was the real victim, because he had 'been subject to harassment on Facebook and other social media by the complaining witness'. 

All three involved are personal trainers in the body building world. 

Assad took first place in the Steve Stone Metropolitan Championships in 2013. Livoti won first place for Best Physique at the 2014 NPC Universe competition in New Jersey. 

When the couple broke up, Livoti took out an order of protection against the bodybuilder in Manhattan Family Court.

Assad's top charge in the March 18 court appearance was reduced to a misdemeanor and he admitted to criminal contempt as a part of a no-jail plea deal.

The judge ordered a full and final order of protection for Livoti and Murray and Assad agreed to complete the New Start stalker program.
