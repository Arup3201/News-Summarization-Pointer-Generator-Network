Hugh Dennis has all the appearance of a grown-up: greying hair, deep and commanding voice, successful job.

But there's more than a little bit of the child in the 52-year-old comedian and star of Outnumbered. 'I love rolling down hills,' he confesses.

'I do it whenever I can - though preferably not when people are watching. There's a bank in my garden on the South Downs that's very good for rolling down.' 

Hugh Dennis has launched a National Trust campaign to get 200,000 kids playing outside this summer

We're talking about the great outdoors because Hugh has just been unveiled as the new face of the National Trust's campaign to get children to enjoy the countryside more - and he's on a roll, as it were.

'There's another game I like to play where I pretend to be a stuntman. It's best if you're on a sand dune. You run along a sand dune, then pretend you've been hit by an arrow and tumble down the dune. You can't possibly hurt yourself - it's great.

'Oh, and I love trees too. We shot a film for the campaign the other day and I had to hide in a hollow tree. I could have stayed there for ages but the crew made me come out. I know I'm much happier outdoors than in. I like nothing more than standing on a hill in the middle of a gale. I love it.'

The campaign, called 50 Things To Do Before You're 11¾, aims to get children playing outside after research suggested the time they spend outdoors has halved in a generation.

Some 50 per cent of today's children spend less than an hour outside each day, compared to their parents' childhood average of 2½ hours. Among the activities on the list are flying kites, climbing trees and hunting for bugs, and the Trust is organising 1,000 events at its venues over the summer to get children connecting with nature.

Unlike many proponents of the campaign, Hugh, who has a son Freddie, 17, and daughter Meg, 15, with his garden designer second wife Kate Abbot-Anderson, is no zealot.

Hugh says he is far more fun than his on screen character Pete in Outnumbered

Ever reasonable, as you might expect from the man who played modern dad Pete Brockman to perfection in Outnumbered, he's realistic about the temptations of computer games that keep children indoors.

'The danger is you can get very negative about technology, but I wish I'd had an iPad when I was a kid. You need a balance. You don't want your children to be on their computers all the time just because you can't be bothered to take them somewhere interesting. They learn things by seeing what's out there. I've always tried to get my kids to enjoy nature, but I don't think I've been any more successful than anyone else.'

Hugh had an idyllic if eccentric childhood growing up in east London, the son of a vicar (later a bishop) and a teacher.

Although he was desperate for a dog, his parents bought a cat instead - but he insisted on pretending it was a dog and even took it for walks using a washing line as a lead. He remembers, more than anything, the freedom he had as a child.

'I was getting the bus to school from the age of five with my brother, who's two years older than me,' he recalls. 'I never had to tell my parents what time I was going to be home. I loved having time to wander about and nobody would worry.

'Our home was a big, dilapidated Victorian house. At the end of the garden was a bombsite and I remember digging for snails... actually I have great trouble resisting that kind of thing now. My parents were always very reasonable.

Hugh first found fame with the BBC comedy, My Hero

'When I was growing up there were discussions about whether certain things were good or bad, but I don't remember being told off. That's why I'm such a reasonable person. I try to be like my parents and I have these great waves of guilt when I don't quite manage it. It's very difficult, bringing up children.'

He says he tries to be a different sort of dad from the ultimately self-defeating Pete in Outnumbered. 'I'd like to think I command a lot more respect than Pete,' he laughs.

'But I'm not sure that's true. Whenever I watch Outnumbered I do think Pete often behaves in exactly the opposite way to how I would.'

Unusually - perhaps uniquely - for a celebrity, Hugh has no stories of angst, bullying or depression. The one regret in his life is that he wasn't able to make his first marriage - to childhood sweetheart Miranda Carroll - work, but then he's never been happier than he is with Kate and their children.

He never harboured dreams of fame and fortune; although naturally witty, he only ever saw comedy as a hobby until it started taking over his life. Educated at the private University College School in London and then Cambridge, where he read geography, he only joined the Footlights drama club because it seemed like the thing to do.

'I'd only ever appeared in one play before and when I joined the Footlights it was never with the idea of making a career out of it,' he recalls.

When he left Cambridge with a First MI5 tried to recruit him, but he turned them down because he 'didn't want to do people over'.

Instead he worked in Unilever's marketing department and carried on with the comedy with writing partner Steve Punt, yet still saw it as a sideline when the pair started appearing on Jasper Carrott's BBC1 comedy shows.

'But then Steve and I were offered The Mary Whitehouse Experience and I knew I wouldn't be able to combine it with work,' he says. 'So I said to my boss, "I don't know what to do. I've been offered this show on BBC2 and you're about to send me to Milan."

He said, "What do mean you don't know what to do? Just go and do that." They gave me a sabbatical so I could see how it worked out, but I never went back. 

'My career was never a deliberate, terribly focused thing, I've just been tremendously lucky. I'm doing something I love and I'm lucky that my hobby - though I hate that word because it sounds like I'm doing miniature ship building - became my job.'

Hugh regularly appears on the panel of Mock the Week

Fame came slowly, first with BBC1 comedy My Hero, then with Mock The Week and Outnumbered. The last series of Outnumbered finished earlier this year, though the hope is there'll be more stand-alone episodes.

'We're still all in touch and we're told there'll be specials,' he says. 'I don't think it ended because the kids are grown up and the stories aren't there. It's more because they're appearing in their own things. Trying to get everyone together is like trying to organise a family holiday when your children have left home.'

He laughs about the fact that his fame has reached around the world. 'A man recently stopped me and said, "Sir, you are a very big star in Zimbabwe," as My Hero is still being shown in his country. I still can't fathom it,' he shrugs. 'But I'm pleased people know my name rather than asking, "You're, erm, erm, what's your name again?" like they used to.'

He says he regularly gets asked for his autograph in the street now - something that causes great embarrassment to his children.

'Oh, I embarrass them all the time,' he guffaws. 'Sometimes I'll find myself dancing in the kitchen and then I see them standing there with this very stern "What are you doing?" look on their faces.

Kids are never gentle. They never take you in a corner and say, "We'd prefer it if you didn't do that." They just say, "Dad, don't ever do that again." But if you can't embarrass your children, what's the point of having them?'  

And then off this lovely, unassuming man skips - presumably looking for a hill to roll down.
