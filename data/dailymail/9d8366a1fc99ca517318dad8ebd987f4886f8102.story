Forget the likes of Mercedes, BMW or Jaguar. Britain’s favourite car is a Skoda.

The Skoda Yeti came top in a national satisfaction survey, with two other Skoda models also making the top ten.

The flagship Skoda Superb was second and the Skoda Octavia sixth – not at all bad for a car which was once known for the comedy it produced, not its quality.

More than 46,000 car owners took part in this year’s survey, for Auto Express. The Yeti, which costs from £14,945 to £26,400 for a top of the range model, achieved a top score of 92.65 per cent in overall satisfaction ratings.

According to the magazine, the Yeti is a ‘compact sports utility vehicle offering multi-purpose practicality, hatchback handling and genuine off-road ability in a great value package’.

Britain’s Jaguar XF saloon took third spot in the survey followed by the Renault Scenic, Mazda CX-5, Skoda Octavia, Alfa Romeo Giulietta, Land Rover Discovery, BMW 3 series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.

Editor-in-chief of Auto Express, Steve Fowler, said: ‘We’ve always liked the Yeti – it’s a former Auto Express Car of the Year – so it’s great to see so many owners agreeing with us. They like its practicality, the tech on board and how easy and enjoyable it is to drive.’ 

Newcomers to the top ten list were the British-built Land Rover Discovery and the multi-purpose Renault Scenic. Mr Fowler said: ‘For the British company especially, it’s great news given the recent launch of premium new models like the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport – they’re clearly moving in the right direction.’

Czech car-maker Skoda has undergone a huge image change since it was taken over by German car giant Volkswagen in the early 1990s. Before that, its unreliable reputation made it the butt of countless jokes, such as  ‘how do you double the value of a Skoda? Fill it with petrol’.

But last month sales of new Skodas hit an all-time high in Britain, with car registrations breaking the 9,000 barrier for the first time.

A total of 9,711 customers bought a 13-plate Skoda in March, up 14.2 per cent on last year.
