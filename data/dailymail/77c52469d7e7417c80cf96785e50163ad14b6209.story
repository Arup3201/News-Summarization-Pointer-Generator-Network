A veteran federal agent and his school teacher wife were found dead in their Virginia home early Wednesday morning after gun shots were heard by their two daughters.

Paul Parisi, 46, and Jannine Parisi, 47, were found at about 5am by officers called to the home after their two daughters fled to a neighbor’s house to call for help. The two girls were unharmed.

Police have ruled out a third person being the shooter and are investigating the twin killing as a 'domestic situation,' officials told local media.

Investigators haven’t detailed who the aggressor was, or any other details surrounding the shooting, but have said there is no threat to the public.

‘At this point, we are investigating this as a domestic situation,’ an official told WTOP.

Mr Parisi was an arson and explosives agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said reports. He had been with the agency for two decades.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family members who have suffered a tremendous loss today,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘We request that the family’s privacy be respected so that they can grieve in private.’

Mrs Parisi was a physical education teacher at a local middle school who was beloved by her grief-stricken students.

‘You could come to her for anything,’ one of her former students told the Washington Post. ‘She was more than a teacher, we were all her children.’

Mr Parisi had been with the ATF since 1993, his wife a teacher at the school since 2005.

Students were sent home with a note written by the school’s principal.

‘Today has been a very emotional day at Franklin as we learned of this tragedy... Our thoughts are with Jannine's family and friends during this extremely difficult time.’

Relatives were mortified by the sudden death of the outwardly happy couple.

‘Jannine was the sweetest person in the world,’ her brother-in-law told the Post. ‘You couldn’t have picked a worse person for something like this to happen to.’

The Parisis were married for two decades, he added.

Shocked neighbors spoke of how the family was always outside running, playing basketball or spending time together.

One neighbor called the Parisis were 'a wonderful family' when speaking to WTOP. 'We socialized with them - just all-around nice people. It's a shame,' the neighbor added.

‘It's a little shocking to think it happened right around the corner,’ neighbor Bob Young told the Post.

‘It's pretty tough. Hopefully the kids are OK. I'm not sure what's going on in the house.’

‘My girls played basketball with their youngest daughter,’ another neighbor told NBC Washington.

One neighbor sang a different tune to CBS Washington, one that painted a much darker picture of the family.

‘I didn’t know there was any problems going on in that house until a couple of months ago when there was an ambulance and police officers,’ said Jinnie Maluff.

‘I feel really bad about it because maybe we could have done something to be of more support, she added.

Another neighbor told the Post of how despite living next door to the Parisis, he had no idea the family was unhappy.

‘You are so busy in your own life that you don’t find out about your neighbor’s issues, you just wave and say ‘Hi.’
