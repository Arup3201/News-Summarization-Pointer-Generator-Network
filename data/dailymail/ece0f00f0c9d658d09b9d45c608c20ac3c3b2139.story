A woman leapt to her death from a City rooftop restaurant after a Facebook stalker exposed her westernised lifestyle to her Muslim parents.

Rema Begum, 29, plunged 80ft from the terrace of Coq d’Argent after sipping a glass of wine and climbing on to a ledge.

She landed in front of horrified workers outside Bank Tube station and died instantly. Once the ‘life and soul of the party’, she had been plagued by an internet stalker who used information from her Facebook profile to send poison pen letters to her and her parents.

She was also suffering depression 
after losing her manager’s job at the British Library following a row 
with her bosses, an inquest at City of London coroner’s court was told 
yesterday.

Miss Begum feared she was living an 
impure life and as punishment was worried she would not be allowed into 
paradise. On September 4, she went to Sir Terence Conran’s Coq d’Argent 
and ordered a glass of wine.

At about 6.30pm, she put down her 
handbag and glass, with a note underneath it, and diners saw her climb 
onto a ledge and fall eight storeys.

Including Miss Begum, four people have plunged to their deaths from the building since 2007.

A post-mortem revealed she was not drunk, and the court heard she had left a string of suicide notes dating back four months.

In her handbag, police found anti-depressants, a bottle of vodka and a note containing contact details for her next of kin.

In the days before her death, Miss 
Begum, who had lived alone in Islington, North London, confided how she 
was ‘struggling’ to reconcile her Muslim faith and her lifestyle. The 
day before she died, Miss Begum had been to her local hospital with her 
parents after she tried to hang herself – but insisted it was a cry for 
attention and promised she would not do it again.

Her university friend Avril Atkins 
said she had been a ‘very happy, very bubbly’ woman ‘like the life and 
soul of the party’, but had become reclusive. Although she came from a 
‘traditional Muslim family’ and followed some practices including 
fasting, she lived a ‘western life’ independently and had non-Muslim 
partners which her family had found out about, Mrs Atkins said.

‘She had some problems with Facebook. 
Somebody – she didn’t know who – had been sending letters to her parents
about her lifestyle and relationships.’ Miss Begum reported the abuse 
to the police, before deleting her Facebook account and replacing it 
with one using a different name, the inquest heard.

Miss Begum, who was also grieving for a
relative, had her British Library contract terminated after falling out
with management last Christmas, the coroner was told. Her depression 
began shortly after that.

Mrs Atkins told the inquest: ‘Towards 
the end she was having issues with one of her managers. It was causing 
her a lot of stress.

‘One thing that did really worry me 
was she did say to me she hadn’t been living a good Muslim life and that
she wouldn’t go to paradise and I was saying to her that she had done 
nothing wrong with the way she lived her life, her family should be 
proud of her.’

Miss Begum’s parents Abdul and Rufia Hakim did not attend the inquest.

Coroner Paul Matthews recorded a suicide verdict. He said there was no doubt Miss Begum was suffering from depression.
