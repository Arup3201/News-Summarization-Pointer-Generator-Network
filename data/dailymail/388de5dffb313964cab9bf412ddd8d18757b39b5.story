The CIA is paying AT&T more than $10million a year to provide phone records for overseas counter-terrorism investigations adding another agency to the list of government offices tapping into citizen's phone logs.

The New York Times quoted government officials confirming that the second-biggest American mobile service provider is cooperating under a voluntary contract.

That means that this partnership is a financial one, and AT&T is not under subpoenas or court orders compelling the company to participate.

Paying customers: The CIA pays AT&T $10million to hand over information about potential terrorists, and the financial deal proves that the partnership between the phone company and the agency is not forced

AT&T did not confirm or deny the report but said payments from governments were routine for lawful data.

The report comes amid widespread political uproar after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents describing how the U.S. government collects far more internet and telephone data than previously known.

Under the AT&T arrangement, the CIA supplies phone numbers of overseas terrorism suspects and AT&T searches its database to provide call records that may help identify foreign associates, the paper said.

Most of the call logs provided by AT&T involve foreign-to-foreign calls, the paper said.

AT&T does not disclose the identity of the Americans calling from the United States, and masks their phone numbers when it produces the records, the paper said, quoting the officials.

That does little to block the CIA from finding out the Americans involved, however, as it just means that they have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops first.

Another agency: Previous phone tapping revelations concerned the NSA, and now this proves that the CIA (pictured) is involved in very similar operations with the help of the FBI

The CIA is tasked with handling security threats abroad and does not have the rights to obtain certain information about domestic citizens- which is left for the FBI.

To get the information that AT&T obstructs, The Times says that the CIA asks the FBI to order an administrative subpoena to AT&T, forcing the company to hand over the personal data of the phone number in question. The FBI then shares that information with the CIA.

AT&T said all government data requests were handled in a lawful and proper manner.

'We ensure that we maintain customer information in compliance with the laws of the United States and other countries where information may be maintained,' AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said in an emailed statement.

'Like all telecom providers, we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided.'
