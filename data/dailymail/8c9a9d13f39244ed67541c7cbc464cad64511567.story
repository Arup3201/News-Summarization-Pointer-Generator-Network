With painful looking black eyes and blood dripping from their noses, these cartoons show iconic animated characters shockingly reimagined as victims of domestic violence.

Disney princesses such as The Little Mermaid's Ariel and Snow White feature in the collection, as do TV favourites including Marge Simpson and Olive Oyl.

Marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which takes place on the 25th November, AleXsandro Palombo, a contemporary artist and activist, decided to create the striking art to raise awareness.

Let down by their leading men: The characters all hold the sign 'coward' to show how there is nothing heroic about domestic absue

Calling the collection 'Coward'  Palombo depicts each woman holding a picture of their partner with the word stamped across his head in red. 

Run by the United Nations, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women marks 16 days of activism, culminating on December 10 - Human Rights Day. 

According to the UN, 35 per cent of women and girls globally experience some form of physical and or sexual violence in their lifetime with up to seven in 10 women facing this abuse in some countries.

Rocky road: According to the UN 35 per cent of women and girls globally experience some form of physical and or sexual violence in their lifetime. This picture imagines Wilma Flintstone as one such victim 

Famous for his striking and satirical art, Palombo has used characters from popular children's cartoons to highlight domestic abuse on previous occasions.

He said of the current campaign: 'Thousands of women are killed every year all over the world. Femicide is an unacceptable social issue.

The 25th of November was the date chosen for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to commemorate the Mirabal sisters. 

They were three political activists from the Dominican Republic, who were brutally assassinated in 1960 during the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship (1930-1961)

'As a man, I feel ashamed of the behaviours of those who use violence against women. These beings are not men but cowards. 

'It's up to real men to persecute and fight these cowards'

The UN are encouraging people to 'Orange YOUR Neighbourhood' to support the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

The website urges: 'Reach out to your neighbours, local stores, food-sellers on the corner of your street, gas stations, local cinemas, barbers, schools, libraries and post offices! Project orange lights and hang orange flags onto local landmarks, tie orange ribbons where you are allowed, and organize local ‘orange marches’ on 25 November to raise awareness about violence against women and discuss solutions that would work for your community.'
