Teenage tennis wonder Nick Kyrgios is back on home soil following his Wimbledon heroics and he flew straight into his waiting mother's arms at Canberra airport.

Wimbledon wildcard Kyrgios became a worldwide tennis sensation when he toppled world No.1 Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals last week.

But the 19-year-old made a low-key arrival at Canberra on Sunday morning, signing autographs for a handful of die-hard young tennis fans.

'There's no better feeling than being home,' Kyrgios told reporters at the airport.

His mother Norlaila and brother Christos met him at the arrival terminal.

He said he was looking forward to sleeping in his own bed and tasting his mum's cooking after 12 weeks on the road.

Kyrgios played down the hip injury incurred during Wimbledon after pulling out of this week's grass court tournament in Newport, Rhode Island.

He said his hip was feeling all right and the extra leg room of business class helped.

'I'm just feeling really exhausted,' he said.

'I'm just going to relax and not think too far ahead.'

Kyrgios said he was conscious of the sudden and intense public spotlight.

'It's something I'm going to have to get used to if I keep having the same level of success that I've had. I'm just going to have to deal with it... in the right way,' he said.

His mother said his family will keep him grounded.

'The difference is he has an elder brother who is eight years older than him and an elder sister,' Norlaila told AAP.

'They'll keep him in line... They'll keep him humble and tell him to behave himself.'

The family had dinner reservations tonight for a celebratory welcome home meal.

The teenager was unable to reproduce his sensational upset over Nadal and lost the quarter final to eight seed Milos Raonic. 

Kyrgios will soon head back to Melbourne to train before flying off for his US hardcourt campaign in the lead up to the US Open.
