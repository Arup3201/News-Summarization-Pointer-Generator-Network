A bitter husband posted pictures of his estranged wife on an adult website with a message declaring she would 'do anything for £40'.

Michael Anderson, 49, posted holiday snaps of his wife Michelle - with whom he has two children - in a bikini on a website called Hot Mums and MILFs.

Anderson, who pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment without violence yesterday, added a comment which said his estranged wife of 22 years could 'go to the highest bidder', a court heard.

Harassment: Michael Anderson, seen left outside court  yesterday, posted holiday pictures of his estranged wife Michelle, right, in a bikini on an adult website

Anderson posted a link to the adult webpage on Facebook after adding the holiday photographs.

'Devastated' Mrs Anderson, 42, called the police when friends called her to tell her what he had done, and her estranged husband was arrested.

Anderson was given a three-month community order at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday, and made the subject of an indefinite restraining order banning him from making contact with his ex.

Mrs Anderson said in an interview after the hearing that the former couple, who have two sons, split in October when she learned he had cheated on her with one of her close friends.

But Anderson embarked on a campaign of harassment after she left him, Mrs Anderson said.

'He did not take the news well, bombarding me with texts and phone calls and even threatening to kill himself,' she said.

'In January he put the pictures on the Hot Mums and MILFs website and then posted a link to the page on Facebook.

'My friends started texting me and calling me to let me know what he had done.

'I wasn't friends with Michael on Facebook anymore, but my mates sent me the link.

'I was devastated when I saw the pictures and what he had written, it was horrific.

'I was so embarrassed,' said Mrs Anderson, who added that her ex had written that she would 'do anything for £40'.

'There were photos taken of me on holiday and I was wearing a bikini.'

Mrs Anderson said the pictures were taken down after she called the police.

'They were online for about three hours altogether, but it was long enough,' said the mother-of-two, who said she wants to 'put him behind me and concentrate on my two children'.

At yesterday's court hearing Paul Doney, prosecuting, told the court that the harassment all took place between the beginning of January and early February this year.

'The victim said he had been very controlling,' he said.

'On January 4 she was in the Chichester Arms in South Shields with one of their sons, who was playing in a poker tournament.

'At one point he went up to their son and said he was going to knock her head off.

'Later that day he turned up at her house and started shouting before trying to open the kitchen window.'

Anderson was warned by the police to keep away from his former wife, but later in January he turned up at the house demanding a computer from her that he claimed was his. Mr Doney added: 'She then found out that he had posted holiday photographs of her in a bikini on this site, saying she would do anything for £40 and could go to the highest bidder.'

A statement from Mrs Anderson read out in court said he had been making her life 'hell'.

It said: 'I was scared of physical and emotional violence and feel like I am being stalked.

'He is making my life hell and he knows it.'

Charlton James Carr, defending, said: 'It all happened in the aftermath of Christmas, a particularly emotional time for families.

'But since this happened there have been no more problems and everyone has got back on with their lives.'

Magistrates read a report about Anderson from the probation service before sentencing him.

Chairman of the bench Gordon Minto said: 'You appear to have a complete lack of acknowledgement that there was anything untoward about your behaviour.

'We don't see any evidence that you understand what you did was wrong - which makes this particularly unpleasant.

'The only saving grace is that this seems to have stopped.'

Anderson was given a three-month community order with an electronically-tagged curfew between 7pm and 7am and made the subject of a restraining order.

He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
