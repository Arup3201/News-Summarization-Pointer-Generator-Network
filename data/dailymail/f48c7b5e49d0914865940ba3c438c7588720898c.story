The men accused of killing three children and their mother after crashing a stolen SUV onto a Philadelphia sidewalk in July also kidnapped the owner of the vehicle and sexually assaulted her, according to new charges revealed today.

A 45-year-old real estate agent testified on Tuesday that the men held a cell phone to her head and told her it was a gun then forced her to drive to an alley.  

The victim identified 23-year-old Cornelius Crawford and 19-year-old Jonathan Rosa as the attackers who forced her to perform sex acts.

'You want to live? Or you want to die?' the woman, 45, says Crawford asked her as he held up 19-year-old co-defendant Jonathan Rosa's cellphone wrapped in a T-shirt.

She described how Crawford struck her in the temple in order to make her speed up behind the wheel of her 2005 Toyota 4Runner as he barked directions.

'He just gave me orders, to make turns, or keep the speed,' she said.

Eventually, he ordered her to park her car on a quiet street where she was told to perform sexual acts on the two carjackers before Crawford crawled into the driver's seat.

'He was driving crazy,' the woman said, and moments later he drove through a crowd gathered for a church fundraiser, killing a mother and her three children.

The youngest of whom, seven-year-old Terrance Moore Jr, was dead before bystanders could reach him.

In addition to the four dead, the car clipped 65-year-old Thelma Brown, leaving her in a wheelchair with a broken foot and ankle.

'I only moved an inch. I thought I moved faster. All I could see was the guys jumping out of the car, running,' Brown said. 'And then this lady crawled out of the car.' 

Crawford's lawyer, C.P. Mirarchi III, delicately asked why the woman did not mention the sexual assault in her original statement to police after being hospitalized with bruises and broken bones.

'I (thought) they're never going to catch those two guys, and I (didn't) know what happened to the family. I just (kept) it to myself. I (felt) embarrassed,' said the woman, who had a Cantonese translator with her in court. 

The crash immediately claimed the life of the youngest victim, seven-year-old Terrance Moore Jr, who was selling bananas by the bunch to passing cars in support of Eagles Wings Evangelistic Church.

'The little boy, I knew, was dead already,' said bystander Renae Cureton, 55, who watched him make a sale before he and his mother were struck and flipped into the air. 

The boy's 10-year-old brother, Thomas Joseph Reed, and 15-year-old sister, Keiearra Williams were also hit and died later on the day of the crash.

Their mother, Keisha Williams, 34, was hospitalized in critical condition with multiple fractures, before passing away two weeks after the crash. 

Williams and her children often set up a stand to sell fruit near that intersection and hoped to use the money to turn a vacant lot into a playground.

The little boy's father, Terrance Moore, said he 'was starting to learn how to earn a dollar, by selling fruit,' thanks to the boy's mother.

Police say the car likely blew a tire as Crawford went into a high-speed turn, causing him to lose control.

The car was later found in the woods about a mile from where it was originally stolen, the wreck mangled after striking a stand of trees. 

There police recovered the cellphone that had been the decoy gun and which lead to the arrests of the suspects.

Blood on a T-shirt left behind matched with Crawford's, prosecutors said at the hearing. 

Crawford's relatives have insisted 'he's not (a) monster,' and he had been out on parole and working after being incarcerated at 16 for robbery.

Rosa had waived his right to a hearing in August, but told the court then 'I want to ask for forgiveness from the family,' according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 

The second-degree murder charges carry a maximum life sentence.
