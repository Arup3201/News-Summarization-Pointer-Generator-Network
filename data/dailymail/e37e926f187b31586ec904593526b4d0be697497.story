Imtiaz Shah was jailed for 30 months and given a three-year driving ban after crashing into a motorcyclist when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car

A motorist with a health condition which made him fall asleep at the wheel left a motorcyclist paralysed in a 'sickening' head-on crash after ignoring doctors' guidance not to drive. 

Imtiaz Shah ploughed his 4x4 into Steven Hayes's motorbike in April last year, leaving the former mechanic unable to walk or talk. 

The 42-year-old from Nelson, Lancashire, was jailed for 30 months at Preston Crown Court and banned from driving for three years, but is likely to be released from prison after half that time. 

Mr Hayes, 48, is now permanently confined to a wheelchair and requires round-the-clock nursing in a care home. 

His horrified family have spoken of their outrage at Shah's sentence, saying: 'That is not justice'.

'He condemned my dad to a life sentence dealing with those injuries yet he'll be out of prison in a little more than a year,' Mr Hayes's 21-year-old daughter, Jenny, said.

'This incident has had a devastating impact on my dad and our entire family.

'In a split second, my dad was robbed of his independence, much of his ability to communicate and to enjoy his life and his hobbies.

'He will need the support of carers every hour of every day for the rest of his life.' 

The mechanic's wife, Linda, said she was 'grieving' for the loss of her husband's former-self.

'He'll never be the Steven I fell in love with. We are grieving for the Steven we lost that day.'

The court heard how Shah, a former council worker, had been told by doctors to refrain from driving after complaining of sleep apnoea - a condition which causes throat muscles to relax and narrow, putting sufferers into a deep sleep. 

Despite doctors' advice, Shah continued to drive for months, and had clocked up 200miles on the day of the crash. 

Mr Hayes is confined to a wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care. His daughter Jenny, 21, criticised Shah's sentence saying: 'That is not justice'

The 48-year-old was 'deeply unconscious' for months before being released from hospital to a care home

He had fallen asleep at the wheel when driving in Blackburn, Lancashire, while negotiating a roundabout. 

His Honda CRV narrowly avoided crashing into a Range Rover before he crashed into Mr Hayes, throwing his body into the air 'like a rag doll', the court heard. 

The vehicle was eventually stopped when it crashed into a wall. 

Mr Hayes's daughter said he had been 'robbed of his independence' 

'You were falling asleep at the wheel and losing control, narrowly missing a black car as you were veering towards the centre line,'  Recorder Simon Earlam told him. 

'You continued to veer over the centre line. The driver of a Range Rover realised you were not going to straighten up.

'He and his passenger described how your head was down. I find you were probably asleep at this stage.

'It was a sickening collision head on. He was thrown into the air like a rag doll by the force. 

'The impact was such that his helmet came off. Mr Hayes hit your windscreen leaving hair and flesh where he struck. He then hit the road surface leaving a trail of blood on the ground.

'The injuries to Mr Hayes have been most serious and permanently life-changing. They have ruined his life and that of his immediate family.'

Mr Hayes was in a 'deeply unconscious' state for months before being released from hospital and admitted to a care home. 

The 48-year-old needed surgery to have part of skull removed. 

His family plan to launch a civil case against Shah.
