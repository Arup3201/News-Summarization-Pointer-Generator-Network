He may be under pressure following an indifferent start to the season with Manchester City, but Yaya Toure heads up a five-man shortlist for 2014 BBC African Footballer of the Year.

Toure, who won the Premier League this year with Manchester City, is joined by Ivory Coast team-mate and former Arsenal attacker Gervinho.

Now at Roma, Gervinho has become an integral part of Rudi Garcia's team, regularly showing an assured touch in front of goal that deserted him in Arsenal colours.

The duo will face strong competition from Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who enjoyed an exceptional first year at Borussia Dortmund.

Goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept an astonishing 21 clean sheets for Lille last season, while Yacine Brahimi was Algeria's stand-out player at the World Cup in Brazil.

Toure, who took the award in 2013, won the Premier League with Manchester City as well as the Capital One Cup.

He featured at the World Cup for the Ivory Coast, but they failed to make it out of their group.

2. GERVINHO, ROMA AND IVORY COAST

Roma were expected to struggle in Serie A in 2013-14 following a number of high-profile departures. 

But  Gervinho was a pivtoal part of their squyad that surprised everyone by finishing runners-up.

He scored 12 goals as Roma secured a Champions League return after a four-year absence.

 3. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG, BORUSSIA DORTMUND AND GABON

Aubameyang is the only nomination who did not feature at the World Cup in Brazil, and that is testament to his impressive debut season with Dortmund. 

The speedy attacker scored 13 goals as Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga and has been one of the positives for Jurgen Klopp's team in a difficult start this season.

4. VINCENT ENYEAMA, LILLE AND NIGERIA

He even managed to keep out the opponents for an astonishing run of 11 straight games.

5. YACINE BRAHIMI, PORTO AND ALGERIA
