At May’s Football Writers’ Association dinner held in honour of 2014 winner Luis Suarez, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told an audience that he had been privileged to work with the Uruguayan and spoke of the lengths the player had reached to improve his behaviour.

What we know now, as many of us suspected back then, was that Suarez had merely been fooling us all along. Inside this gifted footballer’s head is a brain that simply cannot be rewired.

Towards the end of this awful game in the stifling heat of Natal on Tuesday afternoon, I had found my mind wandering to the next steps in this competition. Thoughts of Thursday’s Germany-USA game and Saturday’s knockout tie between Brazil and Chile had begun to occupy me.

FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings, to which Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence.

A statement on FIFA's website said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of art. 48 and/or art. 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

'The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide with their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.

'According to art. 77 lit. a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), the FIFA Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials' attention.

'Furthermore, according to art. 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).'

There was just not enough to hold the attention at the Arena das Dunas two-thirds of the way through what had pretty quickly established itself as the worst game of this brilliant World Cup.

Suarez, though, changed all that and, just as it had been at Anfield on April 22 2013, he did so with absolutely no prior warning.

This is the thing about the 27-year-old that is so disconcerting.

He doesn’t do vicious, stupid things at the culmination of a festering dispute with opponents.

'He doesn’t do them as acts of retaliation. He just does them instinctively. For reasons that he probably doesn’t even recognise himself, he just does them.

I was at Anfield 14 months ago when Suarez sank his teeth in to the arm of Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea. My experience then ran parallel to my experience on Monday.

First of all, I missed it with my naked eye as I followed the ball elsewhere. Then I saw the replays and suspected a head butt. Then the astounding reality of the actual events became apparent.

Watch 
enough football and you will see just about everything eventually. There
 are only so many possible stories, after all. It’s just the names that 
change.

You become accustomed to the cheating, the sly violence, the 
diving, the moaning and the carping.

Controversy: Luis Suarez is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2012

Bite night! Ivanovic explains what happened to the referee before Luis Suarez received a 10-game ban

'These situations happen on the field.

'I had contact with his shoulder, nothing more, things like that happen all the time.

'I don't know anything, if FIFA analyse each case separately it's going to be complicated.

'I'm very happy to qualify against a European team, after the first match against Costa Rica it was difficult to reverse the situation but we played an incredible match today.'

You think nothing shocks you but then something like this comes along and all that changes. This just doesn’t happen in football. Does it?

Suarez, of course, now has a culinary crime sheet with three items on it. To the names of PSV’s Otman Bakkal (November 2010) and Ivanovic we can now add Italy’s hulking great defender Giorgio Chiellini. This time, Suarez has sinned on the greatest stage of them all.

Prior to 
this game on the north-east coast of Brazil, Suarez had chosen to take 
on the British media again. The sense of persecution he was encouraged 
to feel during his failed attempt to prove he did not racially abuse 
Manchester United’s Patrice Evra back in 2011 had clearly not gone away.

It
 was this warped sense of reality that Suarez took with him in to this 
game. No matter what Rodgers has said to him – no matter the sessions he
 has had with Liverpool’s psychologist Steve Peters – Suarez has still 
not fundamentally accepted his role in the two major controversies that 
have coloured his time in the Barclays Premier League.

Suarez is an angry, self-pitying delusionist lashing out, in word and deed.

On Monday he reacted to his assault on Chiellini by throwing himself to the ground. It was an act of inescapable guilt. Holding his mouth immediately afterwards won’t help his cause when FIFA investigate today either.  

After the final whistle, meanwhile, he hid his face with his shirt. It could have been emotion. It could have been relief at his side’s qualification. It may just have been shame but I doubt it.

Already, of course, the cover-up has begun. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez began it immediately after the game.

'This is all a conspiracy,' he said, rather preposterously.

'People hide behind trees looking for a story.

'Those people know who they are.'

This, of course, is one of Suarez’s major problems in life. There are simply too many people looking to make excuses for him.

Conspiracy theories: Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez believes people 'hide behind trees looking for a story'

I do not include Rodgers in this. The Liverpool manager has done all he can to educate and improve Suarez. Rodgers is rarely critical of his players in public but at the club’s Melwood training base he has not spared last season’s player of the year. To call it tough love is to understate it.

Some people don’t learn though and maybe Rodgers knows this now. If he doesn’t then he surely will when Suarez inevitably cites his ‘troubles’ as reason enough to ask out of Liverpool  once more after this World Cup.

Suarez’s gifts as a footballer are beyond question. Already he has left us with two of the truly great and memorable goals of this tournament. The fact they both came against England doesn’t really matter.

However deep his river of talent ever runs, though, it will never fully submerge or drown his dark side.

Italian machismo may prevent them complaining formally to FIFA today. Indeed that was the indication on Monday night. FIFA should proceed hastily, though. They have to for the good of their sport.

As sad as it sounds, we must now place this episode in the same folder as Zinedine Zidane’s headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and Frank Rijkaard’s spit at Rudi Voller in 1990. That is where it belongs.

After 13 glorious days, this fantasy World Cup of our dreams now has its first very real stain.
