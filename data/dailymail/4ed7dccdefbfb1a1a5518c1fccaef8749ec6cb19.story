It seems man's best friend has fallen out with his master. 

Men today prefer cats as pets, while dogs are more popular among women, a survey of 1,685 pet owners in the UK has suggested. 

The poll, conducted by bed retailer Time4Sleep, found that 34 per cent of men owned a cat, with 33 per cent owning a dog.

A total of 36 per cent of women, however, owned a dog, with just 33 per cent having a cat - making dogs ‘woman’s best friend’.

The poll also found that 25 per cent of pet owners allow their pets to sleep on their beds at night.

Cats, however, are more welcome as sleeping partners than dogs, with 28 per cent of cat owners saying their moggy curled up with them every night, compared to 22 per cent of dog owners.

The earliest use of the phrase ‘man’s best friend’ came in 1821 in a poem in the The New-York Literary Journal which read: The faithful dog - why should I striveTo speak his merits, while they liveIn every breast, and man’s best friendDoes often at his heels attend

A total of 48 per cent of those polled said that rather than share a bed with their pet, they made them a comfy bed of their own elsewhere in their home.

The research also found that Facebook users are more likely to own a dog (50 per cent), whereas Twitter users favour cats (51 per cent).

Jonathan Warren, managing director of Time4Sleep, said today yesterday: 'While we had initially set out to explore the sleeping habits of pets and their owners, we stumbled across research that defied the long held stereotypes of which gender was most likely to own a certain pet.

'Pets are frequently seen as an integral part of the family, so it is not surprising that over half of the population are sharing their bed and letting them enjoy a comfortable, if slobbery, night of sleep.'
