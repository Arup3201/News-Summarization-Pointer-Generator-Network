Wish you had seen more of the world, exercised more or worked harder at school? You’re far from alone.

It seems most of us carry around a few regrets – and we spend more than two hours a week dwelling on them.

A study has found that we typically have six things we would love to change, with the most common cause of remorse being not having travelled enough.

Regrets: One in 20 people think they should have married an ex-partner and 16 per cent feel they wasted years with the wrong partner

More than half of those surveyed 
admitted wishing they had made a different life choice at some point, 
such as having a different career, living somewhere else or marrying 
someone different.

A fifth of women regretted wasting 
time with the wrong partner, compared to 10 per cent of men.

But a 
quarter of the 2,000 participants said they did not believe it was 
possible to live a life without regrets, perhaps explaining why, on 
average, we spend 19 minutes per day – or more than two hours a week – 
thinking about things we could have done differently.

1. Not travelling more and seeing more of the world

2. Not keeping in touch with more friends from the past

3. Taking too little exercise

4. Not saving enough money

5. Taking up smoking

6. Not working harder at school

7. Choice of career

8. Wasting years with the wrong partner

9. Eating unhealthily

10. Not asking grandparents more about their lives before they died

11. Not learning to speak a foreign language properly

12. Not spending enough time with family and friends

13. Not telling a relative who’s now dead that I loved them

14. Drinking too much alcohol

15. Not undertaking a once in a lifetime challenge

16. Not learning to play a musical instrument properly

17. Falling out with a friend and not patching things up

18. Choosing the wrong subjects at school or university

19. Not standing up to a bully

20. Not taking a gap year 

More than a third of us blame a lack 
of cash for preventing us  from fulfilling our dreams, while 25 per cent
think loved ones held us back. But 32 per cent admitted that the blame 
lay with their own lack of courage, according to the research by the 
British Heart Foundation.

Dr Gayle Brewer, senior lecturer at 
the University of Central Lancashire School of Psychology, said: ‘There 
seems to be a certain air of resignation amongst us that living out our 
dreams may simply not be possible for a variety of reasons.’

But perhaps in an effort to ensure we
have fewer regrets to dwell on in future, the survey also revealed that
we have a rather ambitious ‘to do’ list – with winning the lottery our 
number one goal.

1. Win the Lottery

2. Travel the world

3. See the Northern Lights

4. Experience a once-in-a lifetime challenge

5. See world famous landmarks such as the Taj Mahal or the Egyptian Pyramids

6. Swim with dolphins or sharks

7. Live and work abroad

8. Build your own house

9. Go on an African Safari

10. Start up a dream business and run it
