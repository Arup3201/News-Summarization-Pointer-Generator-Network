A Massachusetts woman was arrested last month after police say some pills fell from her pant leg during a traffic stop, but police soon discovered she had more to hide beneath her hard posterior.

Jill Roy, 33, was stopped in Buzzard's Bay on September 16 when the drugs allegedly tumbled to the ground near a squad car.

When she was searched at the station, police say they found Roy was wearing stiff plastic underwear. Underneath those, they say, was a $350 bag of heroin and 13 oxycodone pills. 

Before police found the hidden drugs, they say they first asked Roy what the plastic derriere was all about.

'I don’t have a butt so I wear these and another pair of underwear under it,' the mother of three explained, according to a police report obtained by the Smoking Gun.

Underneath, police spotted a 'large bulge,' which they say turned out to be the opiates.

Roy, who police described as 'skinny,' has an extensive criminal record according to the Smoking Gun. Previous arrests have seen Roy charged with 'possession and distribution of illegal narcotics.'

Police most recently charged Roy with felony and misdemeanor drug possession.

She was held in lieu of $5,000 bail.
