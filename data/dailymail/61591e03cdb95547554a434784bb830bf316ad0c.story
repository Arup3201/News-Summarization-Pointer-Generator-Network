The BBC must change the way it funds itself to secure its future, the director-general warns today.

In a speech to staff, Tony Hall will say he backs plans to overhaul the licence fee ‘to reflect changing times’.

Lord Hall reveals he is open to a new universal levy on every household in the country – even those that do not own a television set or only watch programmes online or on catch-up services.

This would lead to an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free.

The director-general’s speech at Broadcasting House in London comes just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced.

The debate has stepped up a gear as negotiations on renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter in 2016 get under way.

Expressing the BBC’s view, Lord Hall is expected to say: ‘We’ve always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times.

‘I welcome the committee’s endorsement of our proposal to make people pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television.

‘The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee – a universal household levy. Both proposals have the same goal in mind: adapting the licence fee for the internet age.

‘I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee – in whatever form – makes happen more than ever.’

A universal tax would remove the need for the BBC to pursue those who do not pay the licence fee – a costly system that leads to a loss of between £196million - £235million a year.

But ministers say the earliest it could be introduced would be 2026.

A subscription system advocated by the select committee, is opposed by Lord Hall as ‘poor value’.

He will warn that it could fatally diminish the BBC’s ability to compete on digital platforms with other providers such as Netflix, Google and Apple.
