Pop star Rihanna opened herself up to criticism after tweeting her support for a teenage fan who was suspended from lessons for dying her hair the same shade as the singer.

Terri Bancroft, 15, described as an A-grade star pupil, was banned from the classroom for her 'Rhianna Red' hair and was told she would not be allowed back until she returned to a more natural colour.

But the chart-topping  R’n’B singer - who has often been seen 
with her trademark red hair took to her Twitter page to show her support for the schoolgirl.

Star support: Terri Bancroft, 15, left, was excluded from classes for her 'Rhianna Red' hair, but the chart-topping R’n’B singer, right, wrote a message of support which was seen by her 18 million Twitter followers

The message, seen 
by her 18 million worldwide followers on the social networking website, read:

'U are my hero Terry Bancroft!!!!! The color of your hair doesn’t change who u are, you are an A grade student £1love.'

She even linked to a photo of the flame-haired schoolgirl.

Fortunately her encouragement came too late to jeopardise Terri's return to education - she has already dyed her back to brown so she can continue with her exams.

Terri, from Rhyl, north Wales, was excluded from classes at Blessed Edward Jones RC school for a week when the school deemed her hair to be too red.

Her mother Anne-Marie said they were stunned by the tweet.

'I’m a little bit in shock, we never 
sort of expected it. Terri has been a little bit shocked and a little 
bit embarrassed. She found out from a phone call minutes after the tweet
went up.

'She is a fan but she didn’t do it to copy her, it's amazing that she found out about it and tweeted about it.'

Back to school: Terri Bancroft after her red hair was dyed back to brown with hairdressers Jacky Ellis and Marianne Jackson - she is now allowed back in the classroom

'The school put her in consequences 
because of her hair. It’s the room where they put naughty kids. She 
wasn’t allowed out on breaks, she had to be escorted to the dining room 
and was segregated from her friends. She wasn’t allowed the usual amount
of work, so she has been asking for more.

Anne-Marie, a single mum-of-three, 
said: 'Terri is in year 10, and in the middle of her exams. She has 
always been an A* pupil, and has never been in trouble. She wants to be 
an RAF pilot. She went down from five lessons to two a day. I was 
panicking - her results are a big deal to her.'

Staff at Cruze Hairdressing salon 
dyed Terri’s hair back to black for free after reading of her plight and
she is now back in school.

Russell Owen, owner of Cruze, said: 
'Reading the story, we thought it was a pity she was missing out on her 
education. We thought it would be a good thing to do to offer our 
service for free.'

The A* student is now back in class, 
and Anne-Marie Ketley sent a 'huge thank you' to the hairdressers for 
their help as well as members of the public for their support.
