Sergio Aguero looks unstoppable at the moment but is he the best in Premier League history? Stats say he has a better goal ratio than anyone but he’s not making the top of my list of Premier League strikers. He’s not far off though...

11 RUUD VAN NISTLEROOY

His intelligence was what set him apart. I had some quite famous battles with him! His runs were very clever, often standing in an offside position to get ahead of you, then the play would switch sides and you’d have to catch up with him before the cross came in to him. He was an absolute nuisance. 

Ruud van Nistelrooy was a nuisance at Manchester United and boasted a formidable goalscoring record 

10 MICHAEL OWEN

The double in the 2001 FA Cup final against us really hurt. He was like Roy of the Rovers, someone out of a comic who burst on to the scene and blew Argentina away. If you gave him any space behind you, he was gone and he’d score. He would have breezed past Bobby Charlton’s England record if not for injuries. He was never the same again after hamstring trouble relatively early in his career.

9 IAN WRIGHT

Everyone talked about the famous Arsenal back four but Wright scored the goals that won the games. He was a showman and didn’t really enjoy tap-ins. He liked to vary his finishes, you couldn’t guess where he was going to put it. I played against him too and he was determined and strong. An explosive character.

8 ROBBIE FOWLER

He reminds me regularly of scoring the fastest Premier League hat-trick — against me! I think he is the most natural finisher I’ve seen. Scoring seemed so effortless, he’d just guide the ball into the corner - he didn’t need to leather the ball. Injuries stopped him from maintaining the same absurd levels he set early in his career.

7 WAYNE ROONEY

He could yet move up this list depending on the next few years. His breakthrough was phenomenal. I like his determination and the fact he can score any type of goal. He could play in almost any position but I still like him sitting deeper. His record and trophy cabinet say it all.

Rooney's breakthrough when at Everton and then at Manchester United was phenomenal 

6 DENNIS BERGKAMP

The maestro. People didn’t realise how fast he was because he often played so deep. You couldn’t catch him. He had such vision, balance, intelligence and skill. His right foot was like a hook. Henry learned so much from him. He was a perfectionist too, always looking for the perfect pass. Everything he hit was so clean. 

The Dutchman brought a poise to the Gunners which typified the style in which Wenger wanted to play

5 DIDIER DROGBA

I’d have loved to have played against him. As a lone striker, he was as good as there has been. He could occupy both centre-halves with his movement. At a peak, he played on the shoulder and was so powerful. He was so much better than the rest that he still has a role now under Jose Mourinho. He bullied defenders.

4 ALAN SHEARER

My Match of the Day colleague didn’t score too many goals against me! But he was prolific - lethal in front of goal. He hit the ball harder than anyone else and had supreme confidence in his striking ability. He wasn’t big but had an excellent spring and used his body well to score so many headers. You had to be so tight to him or he’d bury the ball.

3 SERGIO AGUERO

If he doesn’t get away from someone first time, he’ll just stop and then try again with a little swivel and drop of the shoulder. Then it’s in the back of the net. Everything’s very controlled and he’s one of the few who doesn’t seem to have a nasty side. And when Manchester City most needed him - on the final day a few seasons ago - he rose to the occasion. 

Sergio Aguero is the man in form at the moment but only makes it to No 3 in Martin Keown's top 11

2 LUIS SUAREZ

He was like a little rat, who wriggled free of people to score goals. His opportunism and ability to score glorious goals in a good but not brilliant Liverpool team was exceptional. He played on the edge and took things far too far sometimes. But he also gave us some incredible moments.

1 THIERRY HENRY

The package of pace, power, skill, intelligence and trophies makes him my No 1. He was a dramatic, driving force when he was in the zone. He was unstoppable once he realised he could win games single-handedly. When he scored his first goal - at Southampton - I said to him that I would be able to tell my grandchildren that I had played with him. And I rarely congratulated people! He looked at me astonished.

Thierry Henry's pace, power, skill and the trophies make him the No 1 Premier League striker of all-time

Special mentions need to go to a few others, who narrowly miss out. Les Ferdinand was my toughest opponent, Nicolas Anelka could have been the new Henry, Andy Cole is often underestimated, Robin van Persie has been blighted by injury and Teddy Sheringham’s longevity was incredible.
