A pensioner has hit out at the NHS for 'allowing' his leg to balloon to an enormous two-and-a-half stone.

Michael Cull, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, can hardly walk because of the weight of the massive limb, which is almost two foot wider than his right leg - and is getting bigger every day.

The 66-year-old former Nasa computer technician is thought to be the only person in Scotland to suffer from elephantiasis - a disease found mainly in the tropics. 

His left leg is so wide he needs to have 
trousers specially made for him, his shoes only last a fortnight because
 the soles wear out, and every time he steps outside he is called names 
like 'Elephant Man'.

He can't even board a plane because the seating space is too narrow for his 20 inch leg.

Mr Cull said his life has been ruined and claims he has been severely let down by the NHS for allowing his condition to get to this stage.

The NHS has urged Mr Cull to speak to his GP.

But he said: 'The last six years of my life have been totally destroyed. I’ve had about 20 [hospital] referrals and no doctor seems to know what to do or even wants to know.

'I’ve had no treatment, no drastic operation, no antibiotics, nothing. The whole system has failed me.

'It is swelling more every day and I’m worried there is a risk I will be left in a wheelchair or need it amputated if I don’t get treatment soon.'

Mr Cull first noticed swelling in his knee after he was knocked down by a car on a pedestrian crossing in London 10 years ago.

At
 first doctors thought the swelling resembled a sports injury, but his 
leg never improved and over six years it started to grow to enormous 
proportions.

He
 was then diagnosed with lymphedema, which cases fluid to build up in 
the arms and legs, but after repeated trips to his GP surgery, doctors 
realised it was far more serious.

Simple tasks such as climbing the stairs and having a bath have become major challenges for Michael Cull, pictured. He also had to give up his work due to health and safety fears as a result of his condition

It was only after seeing a specialist in Dundee last year that it was suggested he had elephantiasis.

But with no mention of treatment, frustrated Mr Cull, went to see a private consultant, paid for by a friend, who recommended reduction surgery, which would involve cutting away the leg tissue and rebuilding it using skin grafts.

As it was private appointment, however, Mr Cull claims doctors on the NHS have refused to act on it.

He said: 'It seems like nobody knows what’s going on. There has been a lot of miss-communication and miss-information all the way along. It’s upside-down chaos.'

Mr Cull’s leg is four times the size of the other and the swelling is starting to spread to his pelvis.

As a result simple tasks like climbing stairs, having a bath and cooking are a major challenge.

He cannot drive and when he takes the bus or train he needs to sit in the disabled area as there is more room.

Mr Cull, who repaired telescopes for the Nasa space programme and worked on various classified military aircraft until he was forced to give up work for health and safety fears.

Mr Cull has to fork out hundreds of pounds a year on trousers and shoes and as his leg is so severely disfigured, due to the extensive swelling, every time he steps outside people stop and stare and shout abuse at him.

He said: 'People call me all sorts of things, like Elephant Man. It makes me really depressed.

'My trousers ride up when I walk so there is no way I can hide it. It affects my leg, foot, and toes. I can’t wear socks because I can’t get them on. Nothing will fit me.'

Mr Cull has now written to various high profile figures in the NHS demanding an investigation.

He has even looked into funding the operation himself in India - but he cannot afford the £10,000 procedure.

'I’m a pensioner. I don’t have that sort of money and why should I pay for it abroad? I’ve been paying into the system here since I was 14.'

One of the best known people with the condition was Joseph Merrick, known as the Elephant man

Elephantiasis is normally caused by a 
parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of 
the world, like India or the Amazon, where Mr Cull grew up.

It is characterised by massive enlargement of an area of the body and is caused by the obstruction of the lymphatic system.

This results in the accumulation of fluids in the affected part of the body.

According to the World Health Organisation, nearly 1.4billion people in 73 countries worldwide are threatened by the condition, which is also known as lymphatic filariasis.

WHO figures suggest that approximately 80 per cent of these people are living in Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Nepal, Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Over 120million people are currently infected, with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease, the organisation claims.

The most famous person to suffer from a form of elephantiasis was Joseph Merrick, better known as the Elephant Man.

In 1884, after four years in a workhouse, Merrick contacted a showman and proposed that he should exhibit him.

His managers then named him Elephant Man and he was eventually sent on a tour of Europe.

He returned to Britain and became well known in London society after he went to live at the London Hospital.

Merrick died in 1890, aged 27. It is reported he died from a dislocated neck when he lay down to sleep, because of the huge weight of his head.

Elephantiasis is normally caused by a parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of the world, like India or the Amazon, where Mr Cull grew up.

It is thought that it may have lain dormant in his body for 50 years before he was hit by the car.

A spokeswoman for NHS Grampian said they were unable to comment on individual cases.

But she added: 'We would urge Mr Cull to get in touch with his GP surgery. His practice have said they would be happy to discuss matters with him.'
