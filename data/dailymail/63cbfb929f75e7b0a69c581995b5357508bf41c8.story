A mother-of-two feared she would go blind when her face dramatically ballooned after she used Piz Buin sun cream.

Joanna Stockton, 36, claims the lotion should be pulled from the shelves because her face swelled so much her eyes could not open following a severe allergic reaction.

Her problems started within 48 hours of using the Piz Buin cream on holiday with her family, which left her blind in one eye.

Frightened: Joanna Stockton says Piz Buin made her face swell up like this, leaving her unable to see out of one eye

She was in Majorca with her husband and two young children aged five and three, and had to have steroid injections to bring the swelling under control.

Mrs Stockton, from Stansted, Essex, said she was terrified she would go completely blind and had to stay inside for a week until the swelling went down.

'It was incredibly frightening. I bought the sun cream as a health product to protect my skin, but it actually made it worse,' she said.

'I applied the lotion on the first day of my holiday and when I woke the next morning there were red itchy bumps over my arms and legs, a bit like a nettle rash.

'The rash got worse and worse and a day later my head was so swollen my eyes had become slits, it was horrendous.'

Mrs Stockton said she had an anti-histamine to try and control the swelling, but it had no effect and by tea time that day one eye had completely closed.

'My whole face was throbbing and I was frightened I would go completely blind,' she said.

'I lost all the features on my face and couldn't smile or move my mouth properly.'

The emergency doctor visited her apartment and gave her two steroid injections and a course of steroid creams and after three days the swelling started to go down.

Last week, Piz Buin sun cream featured on 
the BBC's Watchdog show after producers were inundated with 
health complaints about it.

Leading

 dermatologist Dr Ian White, of St John's Institute of Dermatology in 
London, said two of the cream's ingredients could be the reason 
for the severe reactions he had seen.

He
 said his organisation had demanded urgent action into the safety of one
 of the chemicals used in Piz Buin, C30-38 Olefin/Isopropyl Maleate MA 
Copolymer, two years ago.

He
 also claimed that one in 10 of the patients he now sees were allergic 
to another active ingredient in the cream - Methylisothiazolinone.

But she was left with cuts all over her face where her skin had been swollen and stretched.

'It completely ruined my holiday as we were only there for a week. I was in a lot of pain and had to stay inside out of the sun,' she said.

'To make matters worse, when I got back home my whole face peeled as if I'd had sun burn and I was left with really dry skin.

'I used the sun lotion on the children too and I'm just so relieved they didn't have the same reaction.'

Mrs Stockton, who was on holiday earlier this month, was offered a refund by Johnson & Johnson, the makers of the sun lotion, which she claims was to blame for her allergic reaction.

But she says she wants to see the product pulled from the shelves.

Yesterday Marie Goldie, 37, of Glasgow, who was on holiday with her partner and two teenage children in Tenerife, Spain, was taken to hospital days after she started using Piz Buin 1 Day Long.

Doctors at a hospital in Playa de las Américas feared the catering worker’s reaction was so bad she would require an emergency operation - but steroid injections eventually brought it under control.

Last week, the sun cream featured on the BBC's Watchdog show after producers were inundated with health complaints about it.

'If it was just me that had suffered an allergic reaction it would be one thing, but it was featured on Watchdog and lots of people had complained about getting a rash,' she said.

'I think the company should take responsibility and re-test the product.'

A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said today: 'The makers of PIZ BUIN have provided consumers with a range of high quality, safe and effective sun protection products for more than 65 years.

'We aim to provide products that meet consumer needs and expectations and we sympathise with anyone who experiences a skin reaction and recommend they consult their doctor for advice.

'The safety of our products is our first priority, and is backed by a strict and rigorous safety policy. All ingredients in our products are reviewed by experts and all our final formulations are assessed for both safety and efficacy, including the potential for skin irritation and toxicity caused by sun exposure'.
