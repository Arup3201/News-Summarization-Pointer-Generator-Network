Officials found the bodies of an elderly man and woman at a destroyed home that was a victim of the still-raging Colorado wildfire that was thought to have started from a protective burn.

The couple, who are the only known victims of the blaze so far, were identified as Sam Lamar Lucas, 77, and Linda M. Lucas, 76. A cause of death was pending for both.

A third person is missing in the fire zone, authorities said.

Jefferson County Sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said authorities do not know how many houses were lost but said it was at least five and probably more than 10. Earlier on Tuesday, authorities ordered residents of more than 900 homes to evacuate.

Warning: Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior. Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens advance warningÂ 

Precautions: Over 100 firefighters were called in from neighboring states, but officials still don't want to completely put out the fire as it will help prevent future blazes

Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior.

Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens as much advance warning as possible.

'We're in a defensive mode, structure protection only,' Ms Kelley said. 'We're not really fighting the fire right now.'

Evacuees formed a long line to see a 
list of damaged properties posted by the Red Cross at Conifer High 
School. Residents groaned when officials told them it wasn't known when 
the fire would be contained.

'Know that there are hundreds of 
people out there right now working to save your homes,' said Daniel 
Hatlestad of the Jefferson County Incident Management Team.

That did not satisfy concerned residents.

Spared: So far two deaths have been reported along with an unknown number of ravaged homes in the Colorado fire, as this picture near North Fork Wildlife shows the tree damage

Damage: authorities do not know how many houses were lost but said it was at least five and probably more than 10

Hot hot heat: The fire burned so hot that it melted farm and construction machinery, creating a silver stream of molten metal and softening the soles of deputies' shoes

'I understand that it's a difficult situation, but it's our house, and we're in the target zone,' John Ryan, 47, said.

Jan Quigley said she and her husband 
were 'just in a dither' after they got an automated phone call telling 
them to evacuate. They grabbed clothes, a backup computer drive and tax 
records and left. 'I'm hopeful it will be OK,' she said.

About 100 firefighters were expected 
to spend the night protecting homes. Officials were calling in help from
as far away as Arizona and hoped to be able to have air tankers drop 
fire retardant on the flames Tuesday.

Mr Hatlestad said the fire burned so 
hot that it melted farm and construction machinery, creating a silver 
stream of molten metal and softening the soles of deputies' shoes.

The largest fire was burning about 25 
miles southwest of Denver in a rugged, largely rural area where the 
altitude ranges from 7,000 to 8,200 feet. The region of pines and 
grassland is dotted with hamlets and the occasional expensive home. It 
is several miles - and mountain ridges - west of Denver's tightly 
populated southwestern suburbs, which weren't threatened.

The fire apparently flared up from a 
prescribed burn conducted in the area last week, Kelley said. Prescribed
burns are usually done to thin out vegetation in hopes of reducing the 
chances of a major wildfire.

Dangerous: A plume of smoke rises skyward over the top of a wildfire burning out of control near Conifer, Colorado, on Monday, March 26, 2012

Destructive: A large plume of smoke rises in the in southern foothills of Denver near Roxborough and Conifer, Colorado, as a wildfire erupted amid dry, windy weather

The fire threat in much of Colorado has grown during an unusually dry and warm March.

On March 18, a grass fire charred 37 square miles in eastern Colorado and injured three firefighters.

Across the West, most states face normal wildfire danger, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.

However, the potential for summer 
fires is significantly 'above normal' for New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, 
Nevada and California, said center meteorologist Ed Delgado,

'It's just a changing weather pattern. We're exiting La Nina, and becoming more neutral in that pattern,' Mr Delgado said.

'Historically when we've entered this 
weather pattern, we've had situations that would be conducive to those 
areas having a higher fire threat.'

La Nina is a cooling of the surface water in the Pacific Ocean that causes disruptions to weather patterns.

Billows of smoke were visible from 
downtown Denver. Weather radar showed the smoke plume had drifted about 
100 miles to the northeast by nightfall, and state health officials 
warned smoke could linger and affect air quality until Tuesday 
afternoon.

Evacuated: Authorities say at least some homes have been destroyed in the mountains west of Denver because of the ferocious flames

Congressman Mike Coffman offered 
condolences to the families of his constituents whose homes were 
destroyed and said he will work to get federal firefighting teams and 
equipment if Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink requests them.

Another fire was burning near Lookout 
Mountain west of Denver, where homes dot the forest along a steep, 
winding road with spectacular views. The sheriff's department said 
residents of two homes were asked to evacuate. The fire had burned 30 to
50 acres.

The Colorado Department of Emergency 
Management said small grass fires ignited in Morgan, Logan and Weld 
counties on the northeast Colorado plains. Winds on the plains were 
gusting to 50 mph.

Denver airport officials said high winds delayed arriving and departing flights by up to 60 minutes Monday night.

Pueblo County in southern Colorado 
reported nine small fires ranging from debris piles to a car destroyed 
in an auto body shop after embers from a trash fire spread to the 
building.

Up to a dozen smaller fires were reported from the northeast Colorado plains to the southern part of the state

Gusts of up to 55 mph spread the fire and kept air craft from being used to extinguish it
