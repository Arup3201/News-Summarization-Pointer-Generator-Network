The smell of a zesty ripe lemon, freshly brewed coffee, or flowers in a summer garden is a pleasure many of us take for granted daily.

But one woman is rediscovering the delights of all of her favourite aromas after NHS surgery at a pioneering clinic restored her sense of smell after almost four decades.

Keen cook June Blythe, 65, of Taverham, Norfolk, realised the operation was a success when she was suddenly able to smell lemon she was zesting to make lemon and sultana scones.

Ecstatic: June Blythe has recovered her sense of smell after 37 years following new pioneering surgery

Mrs
Blythe lost her sense of smell and taste when she
developed the condition chronic rhinosinusitis in 1975 just before the 
birth of her second daughter.

But amazingly the grandmother still won prizes for cooking, despite being unable to smell or taste anything she made.

She said she actually got her pleasure from her food giving satisfaction to others.

Mrs Blythe also refused to let her condition stop her from training and working as an aromatherapist, treating her clients with plant oils.

The problem, which left her unable to breathe through her nose and aggravated her asthma, failed to be cured by three operations to remove growths from her nasal passages.

But after an extensive operation to clear polyps -abnormal growths of tissue - from her sinus cavities at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, her sense of smell returned.

Mrs Blythe underwent surgery as a patient at Britain's only NHS Smell and Taste Clinic at the James Paget University Hospital.

The
pioneering clinic is helping diagnose and treat people from across the 
country that suffer from a condition called anosmia - the inability to 
detect odours.

Small instruments were used inside the nose to take out each polyp, and surgeons then washed out Mrs Blythe' sinuses.

Mrs Blythe is now rediscovering a world of smells and scents, and the powerful effect it has had on her emotions and sense of taste.

Blossoming: Mrs Blythe's sense of smell is finally allowing her to enjoy her favourite scents again, including her flower garden

She said: 'I just keep having these amazing experiences. I can honestly tell you it's like I'm living in a different world. 

'I never thought that this would be an experience I would ever have after 37 years of no sense of smell at all. I'm just taking full advantage now to be able to smell everything and taste everything.'

Mrs Blythe underwent her latest three hour operation on June 26 and did not held out any hope that it would be a success.

But her sense of smell suddenly returned at home ten days later, when the inflammation had gone down.

She said: 'I was cooking with lemon, making lemon and sultana scones for friends coming round and all of a sudden I could smell lemon.

'I was on my own and just stood there and cried.'

  1)  'Lemon has to be the best one as that
was the first thing I smelt and it was a tremendous feeling. Grating 
that lemon and realising that I could smell it - I was beside myself.'2) 'Coffee has to be second because it's just lovely.'3)' The spices that I use with my cooking. I love cumin, chilli, 
coriander, but all of them really. I love getting out my mortar and 
pestle and grinding seeds now.'4) ' I'm a member of Plant Heritage and I absolutely adore flowers, so it 
would be that. I wish it was rose season, but I just missed it this 
year.'5) 'My husband's 
garage at Easton, Golden Days Motor Services. It's an Aladdin's Cave of 
parts of classic cars and our customers have often mentioned that they 
wish we could bottle how it smells, as it's a very distinctive, 
old-fashioned smell of oil and engines that you don't get at new 
garages. It reminds me of when we were first married and how John used 
to smell when he came home from work.'

Mrs Blythe rang her husband John who runs a classic car business to tell him the news.

He then asked if she had smelt anything else yet and told her to try smelling coffee.

She was too afraid to try it at first, but when she opened a packet of Italian ground coffee and realised she could smell it, she admitted she was 'overwhelmed'.

A few days more she finally had the courage to put on the perfume she had never smelt - the Estee Lauder brand Intuition that she worn for years after it had been chosen for her by her two daughters. She said: 'I knew instantly what my daughters and husband meant when they said it smells of Mum, and I loved it.'

Regaining her sense of smell has also awakened strong emotions from the time before she developed chronic rhinosinusitis.

Mrs Blythe who has two grandchildren said: 'My first baby boy didn't survive. He was full-term but he died and we had to come home from hospital without a baby.

'You can imagine there are those smells that distinctly associated with a baby and I went straight into the nursery we had prepared and I could smell everything.

'The smell of the wool, the newness of the clothes, particularly the Johnson's baby powder and the soap. 'You smell it and you never forget it.

'I would torture myself and keep going in to the room, opening the wardrobe and holding the little vests and smelling them and the smells of a new baby.'Mrs Blythe was able to enjoy the same aromas when she and her husband had their first daughter Susie. 

Favourite smells: Coffee and lemons are among the aromas Mrs Blythe missed most

But she had completely lost her sense of smell by the time her second daughter Claire arrived so she is now eagerly awaiting the arrival of her third grandchild, due early next year.
