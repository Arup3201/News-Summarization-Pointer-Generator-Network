Law enforcement officials in southwest Ohio say two people attempted to smuggle a heroin-laced Bible into the Hamilton County Justice Center.

Officials say 39-year-old Tehani Teepe sent the Bible to 28-year-old inmate Timothy King. 

Both have been charged with illegal conveyance of contraband into a correction facility.

Hamilton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Robison says an officer examined the Bible following a standard sweep of deliveries using a K-9 in December. 

The book was sent to the coroner's office for testing after the officer noticed a coffee-like stain.

The coroner's office confirmed the substance was heroin. A regional narcotics unit determined the stain contained about 30 to 40 hits of the narcotic.

'It's very inventive in my opinion,' said Chief Deputy Mark Schoonover said. 

'I just want to point out the great lengths they're going to to get drugs into our facility.'

If convicted for this crime of biblical proportions, the two could face up to five years in prison and a  $10,000 fine.

King was transferred to Butler County Jail following the smuggling bust.
