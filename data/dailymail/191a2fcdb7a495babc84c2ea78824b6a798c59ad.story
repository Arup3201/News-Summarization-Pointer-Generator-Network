Cruel: Nai Mai Chao was jailed for taking photographs of dying patients and putting them on her Facebook page with demeaning comments

A nursing assistant has been jailed and banned from using Facebook and other social media websites after posting a dying patient's buttocks on the internet.

Nai Mai Chao, 26, took graphic pictures of at least two patients using bed pans while working at the Regency Pacific Nursing and Rehab Center in Gresham, a suburb of Portland, Oregon.

She then put the photographs on her Facebook page and wrote derogatory comments about them.

Chao was found guilty of an invasion of personal privacy and sentenced to eight days behind bars.

She was also fired from her job and had her nursing licence revoked.

One of the patients was shown lying down with their buttocks exposed.

Another photograph showed the back of a patient's head.

The rest of the pictures, which were taken in April last year, showed the contents of bed pans, a two-day trial heard.

Kelley Cloyd, a prosecutor assigned to the Multnomah County's Gresham office, said: 'It's a good lesson that we need to be responsible about things we are posting online.'

After Chao posted the photographs on her Facebook wall, her friends either made fun of them or added comments showing their disgust.

She denied taking the photographs but admitted putting them on the website.

A jury took only half an hour to find her guilty.

Chao was arrested last September after a co-worker recognised a patient from their bandages in a photograph and reported the matter to a supervisor.

Chao surrendered her nursing certificate in January and was fired from her job.

She was sentenced at the end of last month and released from prison on Friday.

In addition to the jail sentence, Chao was ordered to avoid all social media sites, including Facebook, Google+, Twitter and MySpace.

She was also ordered to write a 1,000-word apology to a patient that 'should be an insightful look at why the defendant did what she did'.

Sacked: Chao was fired from her job at the Regency Pacific Nursing and Rehab Center in Gresham, a suburb of Portland, Oregon.

If the letter fails to meet that standard, a judge ruled, she could be charged with violating her two-year probation.

But the patient will never read the letter - he died two months after the incident

Chao
was also banned from taking pictures of anyone without their 'explicit consent' and forbidden from working with children or the elderly for two years.

Her name was entered into a national database that prohibits her from obtaining a nursing licence anywhere else in the U.S.

The former nursing assistant, who has no fixed address according to court documents, has not commented on the case.
