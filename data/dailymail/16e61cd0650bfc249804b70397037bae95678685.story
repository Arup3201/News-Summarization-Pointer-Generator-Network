David Cameron was left humiliated after being defeated in the Commons today

David Cameron suffered a humiliating first defeat on a Coalition bill today after more than 40 MPs rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer.

The Government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers, but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head-off the backbench rebellion.

Chief Whip Michael Gove faced shouts of ‘resign’ and ‘well done, Chief Whip’, after 17 Conservatives and 24 Liberal Democrats voted against the Coalition Government in its first legislative defeat since 2010.

The rebellion was particularly embarrassing for Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson, who had spoken for the Government during the debate, after the rebels included her husband Duncan Hames.

Matt Hancock, who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill, was reportedly seen ‘grovelling’ to the Prime Minister after the vote.

Some of the absent MPs are thought to have been on the campaign trail in Rochester and Strood ahead of today’s crucial by-election.

The Government lost the vote after it opposed an amendment to its Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to stop publicans being forced to buy drinks from the same brewer they rent from.

Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland, chairman of the Save The Pub campaign, who tabled the amendment, said it would stop landlords being charged ‘unfair and unrealistic rents and rip-off prices for beer’.

But Miss Swinson opposed the move and said the Government would bring its own amendment when the bill was before the Lords.

The amendment was passed by 284 votes to 259. Several ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, missed the vote.

More than 40 MPs rebelled in a House of Commons vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer today 

The defeat comes after the Government narrowly avoided humiliation over the European Arrest Warrant last week amid scenes of chaos and confusion in the Commons.

In January 2013, the Tories were defeated in the Commons on plans to redraw constituency boundaries before 2015, but that bill had not been brought jointly with the Lib Dems.
