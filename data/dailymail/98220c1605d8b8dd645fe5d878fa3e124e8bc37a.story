The former attorney who allegedly drove over six Christmas shoppers in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday night had a crack pipe on the floor of her car and another in the trunk, a report claims.

Stella Mednik, 34, was charged with DUI, fleeing the scene of an incident, and driving on a suspended license after her Mustang convertible crashed into oncoming traffic then careered into a group of pedestrians, who all remain in hospital in a serious condition.

The crash came just three years after Mednik, a Brooklyn Law School graduate, had her legal license suspended for two years following a dispute over misplaced funds.

Charged: Former attorney Stella Mednik, 34, has been reported as the drunk driver who mowed down six people in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday - three years after she was suspended from the Bar

Six people have been seriously hurt after an alleged drunk driver jumped a curb in a busy midtown Manhattan shopping district and struck a group of Christmas shoppers on the sidewalk 

It has since emerged that police have allegedly charged Mednik with possession of an illegal substance after an investigation at the scene uncovered drug paraphernalia, NBC reported. 

Her LinkedIn page describes a history in immigration law, family law, and criminal prosecution.

She states: 'I have arraigned people in various Criminal Courts and participated on of counsel basis as well as lead trials in areas of DWI, criminal trespassing, and possession of illegal substance cases. 

'My aim in life is to help people get out of situations that feel that they have no way out. I take pride in working with immigrants of all counties as I am in the legal consulting business.'

She adds: 'I maybe a sarcastic bitch on this site but i Love people and get them results.'

But in 2011, a New York court found she had failed to report payments made to her personal account from her office.  

According to the New York Daily News, Mednik was under arrest in New York's Bellevue Hospital on Thursday morning, where tests found she was over the legal blood alcohol limit.

It is claimed she is being treated for a broken pelvis, while one crash victim suffered a broken leg.

There are unconfirmed reports that the crash left a little girl pinned under the vehicle.
