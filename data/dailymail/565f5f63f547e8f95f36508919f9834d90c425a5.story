A quiet seaside town was besieged by thousands of Goths at the weekend during a unique festival that celebrates the art of darkness.

Goths, romantics and macabre fans travelled over the moors to Whitby, which has become their spiritual home.

The town in North Yorkshire was chosen because it was where Bram Stoker wrote the gothic classic Dracula.

It is filled with Goth landmarks including Whitby Abbey, which is said to be the inspiration behind Dracula's castle.

The Whitby Goth Weekend is currently in its 19th year and is one of the biggest festivals of its kind in the world.

Since being launched in 1994, the event has become so popular it is held twice a year.

Festival founder Jo Hampshire said the town is 'the heart' of the event.

She told Whitby Gazette: 'I don’t think it will ever move from Whitby.

'Whitby is its home. Goths come to Whitby all year round, whether it’s goth weekend, they come because of its connections to Bram Stoker’s Dracula or for Whitby Gothic Weekend, it would not be the same to run it in another town, Whitby is at its heart.'

Thousands of extravagantly dressed people wandered the streets at the weekend and took in festival highlights at club nights, live music and markets.

The festival celebrates Goth culture, which emerged from the punk scene in the 1980s and developed its own music and fashion styles.
