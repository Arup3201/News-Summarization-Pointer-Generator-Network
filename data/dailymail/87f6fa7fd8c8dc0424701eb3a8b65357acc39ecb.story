A third man has been arrested in connection with the death of off-duty police officer PC Gareth Francis, who died after an assault in Edgeley, Manchester

An off-duty policeman attacked on a night out died from a head injury as a result of a single punch.

Three men continue to be questioned on suspicion of the murder of PC Gareth Francis, 28, in Stockport, Greater Manchester, as a post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death.

Police and emergency services were called at 1.20am yesterday to a report of an assault in Castle Street, Edgeley, where PC Francis was found with a serious head injury.

He had been walking home after being dropped off by taxi from a night out in Manchester with friends when he was attacked.

Paramedics treated him at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to Stepping Hill Hospital, where he died shortly afterwards.

Two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of murder after the incident in Stockport in the early hours of Sunday.

Police said today that a third man, aged 20, had also been arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself in at a police station last night.

All three are from the Stockport area and remain in custody for questioning.

It’s understood football fan PC Francis had been on a night out with friends in Manchester celebrating Manchester City’s win against Fulham at the Etihad stadium.

The group caught a taxi back to Stockport and the officer, who served with Greater Manchester Police, was attacked in Castle Street, Edgeley, just minutes after buying food at a takeaway.

PC Francis’s family paid tribute to him in a statement, saying: 'Our gorgeous son brought love and laughter into not only our lives, but he was an amazing brother, boyfriend, grandson and nephew.

'We cannot imagine how we can face each day knowing that he is gone from our lives.'

Chief Supt Chris Skyes described him as 'a dedicated officer' who will be sadly missed by his colleagues.

Ian Hanson, chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, added: 'Gareth was a much-loved and well respected member of the GMP family. We are all distraught at this news.

'His team are devastated.'

The scene in Edgeley, Stockport, after off-duty police officer Gareth Francis was murdered in the early hours of Sunday

PC Francis's immediate supervisor for
the last four years, Sergeant Alex Cairns, spoke of him as 'a 
consummate professional police officer'.

Sgt Cairns said: 'Gareth's colleagues
on 'A' relief are absolutely devastated by his death. It has hit them 
extremely hard and they are being offered all the support that we can 
right now.

'Most of his career, Gareth worked on
a close-knit relief of between 10 and 14 officers, so you can imagine 
that in teams of that size the news has come as a personal blow to them.

'Gareth was the kind of officer who 
would quietly get on with his job with the minimum of supervision. 'In 
fact, he was pretty much a 'go to' kind of guy. If you needed something 
doing quietly and efficiently, then he was your man. He would volunteer 
to stay late without any complaint and approached everything in work 
with an outstandingly positive attitude.

'All of his colleagues, without 
exception, felt a sense of relief when they knew Gareth would be 
attending a difficult or potentially dangerous incident with them. That 
was the esteem in which his fellow officers held him. He was always the 
consummate professional police officer.

'One measure of his professionalism 
came one day when a colleague approached me and said Gareth had broken 
his hand but was determined to carry on working. I sent him to hospital,
of course, but had I not been told about his hand, Gareth would not 
have mentioned it.'

Mr Francis had been dropped off with 
his friends in Edgeley, Stockport, by a taxi moments after a group of 
‘drunken and rowdy’ men were thrown out of a nearby pub.

The
two groups crossed paths and, after a row between one of PC Francis’s 
friends and a man from the other group, a fight broke out.

Witnesses
said PC Francis appeared to try to calm the situation by standing in 
the middle of the two groups when he was punched in the head and 
immediately fell to the ground.

Emergency services arrived within minutes and discovered PC Francis with a serious head injury.

He was taken to hospital in an ambulance and died later the same day.

Yesterday the area where PC Francis, from Stockport, fell was cordoned off.

Local Joe Taylor said: ‘It is absolutely pathetic and disgusting. These men had been chucked out of the pub because they were causing trouble and arguing with everyone.

‘The next thing we knew there was loads of noise in the street and we saw them grappling with each other and then we heard people screaming that this poor young man was on the floor.

'We heard that he had come in between them and one of the lads punched him in the head and he fell almost immediately. It’s terrible.’

Detectives said the motive for the 
attack is still being investigated but confirmed that they were not 
treating it as a robbery and do not believe a weapon was used.

Two men, aged 20 and 21, both from 
the Stockport area, were arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in 
custody for questioning.

A post-mortem examination was due to take place yesterday afternoon to establish the cause of death.
