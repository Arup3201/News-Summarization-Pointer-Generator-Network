With London now a mainstay of the regular season calendar, the NFL is looking further overseas to expand its product.

Mexico, Canada and China have been touted as the next locations to stage games.

'The work we're doing now is to ask, "How do we accelerate the agenda in Mexico, Canada and China?",' Mark Waller, the NFL's executive vice president international told NFL.com.

'Those would be our next stage, and we have offices in those three countries. And then, after those, where should be our focus? I think we've concluded that Brazil and Germany are the next two frontier markets, which is where the Pro Bowl idea comes from.'

Next year's all-star match-up will be played in its traditional location, Honolulu, but there are rumours that it will move to Brazil.

Germany is traditionally a stronghold of the sport, but the NFL have struggled to strike an adequate deal with television companies.

Meanwhile, after eleven NFL games at Wembley, three more follow this season.

The New York Jets play the Miami Dolphins in the first overseas conference game on October 4.

The Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars compete three weeks later with the Detroit Lions and the Kansas City Chiefs playing the week after that.
