It is one of the most fraught relationships at the top of the coalition government.

But today it emerged that Vince Cable tried to get off to a better start with George Osborne, by inviting him to stay on the family farm soon after their joined the Cabinet together.

The Lib Dem Business Secretary told his wife Rachel he had ‘done an awful thing’ by asking the Osborne’s to join them in the New Forest, but they were spared an awkward weekend when they guests never replied.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable told his wife Rachel he had done an 'awful thing', and invited George Osborne to visit

Mr Cable and his Tory rival clashed repeatedly during the 2010 general election, and failed to strike up the amicable working relationship other ministers enjoyed when the coalition was formed.

Relations were so bad Mr Cable, who had been the Lib Dems’ shadow chancellor in opposition, was handed the Department for Business instead of moving to the Treasury as Mr Osborne’s deputy.

When Mr Osborne’s austerity programme appeared to be choking off growth, Mr Cable called for a Plan B, and later a Plan V, to get the economy moving.

But in the very early days of the coalition, while the government was enjoying its honeymoon period, Mr Cable tried to extend the hand of friendship – albeit reluctantly.

Rachel Smith, Mr Cable’s wife, revealed in an interview attempts to broker a truce with the Osbornes with a trip to the family farm in the New Forest.

She said: ‘I invited them because Vince said to me right at the beginning, during the Government’s honeymoon period: “I’ve done an awful thing…I asked, would the Osbornes like to come to the farm,” he said.’

At a recent event, Rachel Smith said she found George Osborne and wife Frances 'cool' and would not invite them to visit again

However Mrs Smith did the correct thing and formally wrote to the Osbornes.

‘I don’t know what happened to the invitation because I certainly sent it but I think it got lost,’ she told the Telegraph. ‘Anyway, I didn’t get a reply.’

‘I wrote a card but I never received an answer. I’ve seen them since and I thought, should I ask: “Did you ever get my card?” but then I thought no.

‘We did meet them recently at a concert given by the Prince of Wales in aid of the Philharmonia Orchestra.

‘They were so cool, just the same in their private personae as in their public one. And I thought, no, I won’t invite them to the farm.’

However, a spokesman for the Chancellor said: 'We never received any invite, which is a great shame as George would have liked to have seen their farm.'
