Cyclists with tiny cameras fitted to their helmets to film aggressive drivers have become a common sight – but now horse riders are getting in on the act.

A miniature camera has gone on sale that can be attached to horses’ tails.

It is wrapped in a high-visibility sleeve bearing the words: ‘Smile, you’re on camera.’

Safety: Inventor David Daly says his speed camera on a horse's tail can reduce accidents as it will encourage drivers to slow down (stock image)

Inventor David Daly said there were 3,000 accidents a year involving horses and vehicles. Two riders and 14 horses were killed in 2012.

He said he hoped drivers who saw the yellow sleeve on a horse’s tail would slow down and be more considerate if they thought they were being filmed by the £49.95 camera.

Elsewhere on his  Gizapaw website, Mr Daly sells a sleeve that describes the horse's usual behaviour so those approaching it now what to expect.

Dubbed ABS, which stands for Animal Behavior Sleeve, the products feature words such as 'novice' and 'kicker' to forewarn unfamiliar riders.

Law and order: Previously the only horse rider likely to be keeping an eye on a driver's speed was one in a police uniform
