Kris' first acting role was in Closing Numbers with Jane Asher

When I was boarding at Wells Cathedral School I'd really enjoyed acting, so after I'd flunked my A-levels and spent eight months in Hong Kong, staying with my father who was in the Air Force, I returned to the UK to pursue my dream.

By the time I was 19, about six months after I'd finished at Redroofs Stage School in Maidenhead, I went for my first film audition as an actor.

I was living in a not very nice part of Maidenhead, renting a room for Â£38 a week and working in a nightclub while applying for work.

The day I went up for the audition in London was very exciting. It was for a Channel 4 film called Closing Numbers with Jane Asher.

I hadn't done a film audition before so I met the director Stephen Whittaker and read for him. He said he wasn't entirely sure I was suitable for the role but promised to call me later.

As I caught the train back from London to Maidenhead that afternoon I picked up a newspaper that had been left on the seat and it randomly fell open on the horoscopes page.

The advice for Aries, my star sign, was sage. 'Something you do today will colour not only the next few days but the months and the years ahead,' it read. I thought, 'Well, that sounds good to me.' I tore out the horoscope, put it in my wallet and went home.

In the end I did get the job, and spent three days filming in Bushey near Watford. As it was such a small part, I didn't get a car to pick me up and rather embarrassingly I was late on my first day and kept Jane Asher waiting for 45 minutes.

Unfortunately, after Closing Numbers I didn't get another role in film or TV for a long time, but I kept that clipping in my wallet and it became my mantra as a reminder not to give up.

I slogged away in rep theatre gradually learning my craft - I didn't feel I had any other options - and when I wasn't acting I'd work in factories just to keep the money coming in.

Then, just as my career began to blossom - much to the relief of my parents, who thought acting was just a passing phase - I lost the clipping. But it had served its purpose, inspiring me to keep plugging away when times were tough.

My latest role in Death In Paradise is a fantastic job. Spending six months in a beautiful place like Guadeloupe, working with a great cast and dodging hurricanes is a dream come true.

I'd never been a fan of astrology and to be honest I don't believe anyone could make predictions for one-twelfth of the population, but on that day those random words in a newspaper really struck a chord with me.

I can still quote them, that's how much of an impression they made. I'd like to think it was my persistence and talent that got me where I am... but who knows, maybe it was written in the stars too.

Series three of Death In Paradise is out now on DVD and available to buy from www.bbcshop.com.
