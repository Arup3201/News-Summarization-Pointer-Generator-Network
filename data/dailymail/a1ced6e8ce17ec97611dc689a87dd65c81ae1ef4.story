The changing of the guard. Adios Espana. Gone but never forgotten after six sensational years of  tiki-taka delight.

Spain’s sell-by date turned out to be June 2014. Hopefully Brazil will flicker only momentarily across our short-term memory and we will wind back the clock to Euro 2008, South Africa 2010, and to Euro 2012.

Two-time champions of Europe, first-time champions of the world and playing a brand of football that involved pass after pass after pass then boom.

Four years on: Iker Casillas lifts the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after beating Holland in the final

Not everyone’s cup of tea, which is why some may delight in the demise of La Roja and their frills. Hopefully, most will reserve a nod of respect for the legacy left by the delightful dancing, swirling matadors.

Football historians of the future will certainly be able to pigeon hole the second decade of this century into its own unique category.

Just as professionals were getting taller, bigger, more muscly, along came these smaller, trickier, talented players. They put the fizz into physical and the result was a joy to watch.

Every so often a generation is born at a club, which then becomes the core of a national side. 

Spain’s identity became intertwined with Barcelona, a triumph for the Catalans.

Suddenly a country which had gone 44 years without winning a major trophy were beginning to look the business.

Six years ago Spain sliced a swathe through Austria and Switzerland with Luis Aragones at the helm. Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Fernando Torres, David Silva, all young and hungry, were unstoppable.

Italy were shoved aside in the quarter-finals on penalties, Russia in the semi, which left the mighty Germans standing in the way.

Dink! Fernando Torres scored a superb goal for the Spaniards against Germany in the Euro 2008 final

Bosh! Andres Iniesta smashed home an screaming winner against Holland in the 2010 World Cup final

Xavi created the first-half opening for Torres with his chip and the Chelsea striker got the better of Philip Lahm to beat Jens Lehmann. A seismic shock went through world football.

The World Cup was a whole other ball game, though. Once again Spain did not disappoint as they became the only European team to win the Jules Rimet trophy.

Iniesta scored the extra time decider while Iker Casillas won the golden gloves for conceding just two goals and David Villa won the silver boot.

Barcelona were ruling in La Liga and Europe and Spain were conquering the world thanks to the pass masters plus a heartbeat from inspirational defender Carles Puyol, he of the frizzy hair.

The centre half could score a goal, too. Remember the thumping header from Xavi’s corner which beat Germany in the semi-final in South Africa?

Two years ago Iniesta was voted player of the tournament at Euro 2012 as the Spanish armada sailed through to their third consecutive title.

Bang! Defender Carles Puyol scored a thumping header against Germany in the 2010 semi-final

It was glorious to watch. David Silva’s tricks, Cesc Fabregas’s runs, Juan Mata and Torres coming off the bench to score in the last few minutes of the final against Italy.

Last season Barcelona’s standards slipped. The mirror image that is the national team have been a shadow of themselves too. It’s been a privilege, though.

Goalkeeper Casillas, who made major errors in the two defeats, appeared heart-broken as he begged: ‘We ask people’s forgiveness.  We are responsible but also the first ones to feel the pain.

The exit was treated as a tragedy in the Spanish media - Madrid sports daily Marca's headline was "The End - a lamentable end to a glorious era for La Roja".

Not up for it? Xabi Alonso admitted that the Spanish players didn't have the hunger at the World Cup

Xabi Alsonso, formerly of Liverpool and now of Real Madrid, also admitted that Spain were not hungry enough and too many players were unhappy. What an indictment.

‘I believe that we haven't been able to maintain the same levels of conviction, of hunger. The success, the happiness of before is gone, it's run out and we haven't been able to keep it going.

‘It's a completely unexpected failure but that is sport. These things happen. It was unexpected but we have to take the great sadnesses in the same way as we take the great joys, as men.

‘It hurts our pride a lot, but this is football. But as I said, we've known how to win and now we have to know how to lose.

Trouble: Spain were dumped out early of this month's tournament over in Brazil after two defeats

‘We've made lots of mistakes, we've lost a bit of our know-how, and we've paid for it with our solidity that had helped us win so many games.

‘Eras end with defeats... and this was a painful defeat. Mentally we weren't ready, physically maybe the same but, putting that all together, we weren't in the best shape.

'Then we have played against teams that were well-prepared and at their peak, and now we're going home.’

Not yet. Curitiba next Monday awaits. Hopefully Spain can make it a send-off to savour, even if it is ultimately meaningless.
