Prince Harry is facing fresh embarrassment as it has been revealed his nude romp in Vegas may have been caught on video.

Pictures of a naked Harry covering his genitals and hugging a nude woman while playing strip billiards in a Vegas hotel room emerged last week.

Harry, along with the Duke and
 Duchess of Cambridge, is an ambassador for the Team GB Paralympics 
squad.

Before the party: Prince Harry was snapped in Las Vegas admiring a tall blonde, who has been named as 27-year-old Danielle Davidson, before hosting a private party in his hotel room

He is scheduled to attend a number of the elite disabled sport 
events over the coming weeks before returning to his job as an Army 
helicopter pilot.

In 
his first public appearance since the Las Vegas incident, the prince 
will watch swimmers in the aquatics centre on Monday and later that day 
chat to sportsmen and women in the official meeting place for the 
country’s competitors - ParalympicsGB House.

Any video footage of the Prince's antics is bound to heap yet more embarrassment on the Royal family.

'There is video of Harry partying 
naked with women in the Las Vegas hotel room,' a source familiar with 
the situation told RadarOnline.

'There have been some very quiet inquiries to see 
how much the video is worth. If the video goes public this could
 be the biggest Royal scandal ever.'

Only one British newspaper published the naked photographs of the Prince after the Palace issued a warning to the press. However, the snaps were beamed online around the world.

At the time an anonymous source claimed the pictures were just the tip of the iceberg on celebrity blogger Norm Clark's Las Vegas gossip page.

More to see? It has now emerged that the Prince's Vegas romp in which he was photographed playing strip billiards may also have been captured on video

They suggested 'something pretty gigantic' happened during the private party, adding it was 'something more 
serious than strip billiards'.

Radar's source added: 'The video has not been shopped around 
yet, its existence is being kept as discreet as possible.

They added: 'A lot went on in that 
hotel room that night, that much is for sure. With all the attention the photos got, the people with the 
video know it could be worth a fortune.'

The website reported it had not 
seen the video and it was not known whether the alleged footage was shot
 by the same person who took the initial pictures.

A spokesman from Clarence House told MailOnline they had 'no comment' on the story.

The claim is the latest in a string of revelations to potentially tarnish the third-in-line-to-the-Throne's Royal image.

After the nude photos of the Prince emerged last week Harry removed himself from Facebook,
 where he operated under the pseudonym Spike Wells.

Following advice from his private secretary,
 Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is heading an inquiry into the Prince’s 
trip to Las Vegas, Harry deleted his account.

The Mail on Sunday was told that 
the Prince’s two best friends, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, 25, who joined him 
in Vegas, and Arthur Landon, 30, have also closed their Facebook 
accounts, as has one of his key Scotland Yard minders.

The Prince was said to be ‘terrified’ 
further damaging images might emerge and his concerns intensified after 
photos of an ‘even wilder’ week in the British Virgin Islands on Sir 
Richard Branson’s private island of Necker, shortly before the Vegas 
weekend, were leaked to a newspaper.

Pictures from the trip were originally posted on Facebook by one of Harry's friends.

Harry, Inskip and rugby player Adam 
Bidwell, 36, were among his entourage who checked into a £5,100-a-night 
suite on the 63rd floor of one of the city’s most elite resorts.

'The
suite is in a tower that has its own private casino,' said a maid. 'It 
has mohair walls to absorb the sound, a pool and a wet bar.'

They
 ate and drank at the hotel's most exclusive bars and restaurants, 
including the most expensive restaurant, the SW Steakhouse, 
named after the complex’s owner Steve Wynn, who reportedly picked up the
£50,000 bill for their visit. 

The rowdy group then moved on to one of 
the hotel’s nightclubs, Surrender, where they were ushered into the 
red-curtained VIP area.

They
are
 understood to have picked up two girls at the club for the party where 
the naked Prince was captured on fuzzy mobile phone shots and sold for 
£10,000
to the TMZ website.

At 
1.30pm the next day, just seven-and-a-half hours after the now infamous 
'strip billiard' game, Harry is believed to have hosted a second vodka-fuelled  pool party with a dozen ‘randomly recruited’ girls.

‘Girls were 
invited to come over and meet Harry,’ according to a source.

Scotland Yard minders looked on as the girls were ushered inside the private villa – or cabana – at the MGM Grand 
Hotel’s Wet Republic club, according to the source. The party went on for five-and-half-hours.

‘What
is incredible is that his detectives didn’t request any special 
security at Wet Republic,’ said the source. ‘They had no requirements 
whatsoever.

There have been 3,600 complaints to the press watchdog about naked photographs of Prince Harry published in the Sun.

The tabloid became the first British newspaper to carry the pictures on Friday, arguing that the move was in the public interest and a ‘crucial’ test of the country’s free press.

The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said the complaints all came from members of the public, with none from St James’s Palace or any other representatives of the royal family.

The pictures of Harry frolicking in the nude with an unnamed woman while on holiday in Las Vegas made headlines around the world but St James’s Palace asked UK papers, via the PCC, to respect Harry’s privacy.

Sun managing editor David Dinsmore said the paper had ‘thought long and hard’ about whether to use the pictures and said it was an issue of freedom of the press rather than because it was moralising about Harry’s actions.

He told the BBC’s Radio 5 Live The Sun did generally ‘fear’ the PCC, but a decision had been made to publish the photos because of the public interest.

The decision provoked a mixed reaction both in and outside the media industry.

Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said the newspaper had shown ‘absolute utter contempt’ for the law and the Leveson Inquiry.

‘It is not about privacy. It is about money, money, money. And they know that by exclusively printing the pictures, assuming they are the only (British) paper which does, they will get everybody buying the paper to see this.’

In a Twitter exchange with Lord Prescott, Rupert Murdoch denied taking the decision to print the photographs.

‘Decision was rightly that of the editor, and I support [it]. I was in Silicon Valley far removed,’ he wrote.

Posting again later, Mr Murdoch wrote: ‘Simple equation: free, open uncontrollable internet versus shackled newspapers equals no newspapers. Let’s get real.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson said he had a ‘deafening indifference’ to the publication of the naked photos.

He told the BBC: ‘The real scandal would be if you went all the way to Las Vegas and you didn’t misbehave in some trivial way.’
