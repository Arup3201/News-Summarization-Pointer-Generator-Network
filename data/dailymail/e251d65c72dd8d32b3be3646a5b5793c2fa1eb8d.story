Britain’s most tattooed man has been refused a passport, but not because of his skin decorations - but his name.

King of Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite, 34, has been refused an ID renewal because of his unusual moniker, which he adopted by deed poll four years ago.

The Lib Dem activist from Birmingham, formerly known as Mathew Whelan - now called Body Art for short – says it breaches his human rights to demand that he uses his birth name on his passport.

Hard to ID: King of Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite, known as Body Art for short, changed his name by deed poll five years ago and has now been told he cannot get a new passport

Body Art, who has covered 90 per cent 
of his body in ink, including tattooing his left eyeball black, has 
spent more than £25,000 on his passion.

Now, he has been offered work abroad to turn his hobby into a job, and so applied to have his passport renewed.

But
 despite filling out the forms and sending the £72.50 fee, he received a
 letter this week telling him the application had been rejected because 
of his new name.

The 34-year-old has changed his name twice, in 2007 and 2009, and his new moniker appears on his driving licence.

In the name of Art: Although he is Britain's most tattooed man, it is not because of his body art that Body Art is being refused a passport

All covered up: What started with a small inking has now led to 90 per cent of his body covered in tattoos

Innocent days: Body Art as a young Birmingham fan, when football was the main interest

He
 said: ‘I applied for an update on my passport because it had expired. I
 got a phone call from an administrator at the passport office and they 
said there was a problem.

‘They
 said my application was being reviewed by the policy department, they 
said they needed further government documents with my name.

‘I sent them my driving licence, a letter from my MP and a mortgage letter by recorded delivery.’

He
 added: ‘This is a breach of my human rights. They want to put my birth 
name on my passport. But that is not my name any more.’

Body
 Art has now sent an official letter of complaint to the passport 
office, and local MP John Hemming is backing him, and has also written 
asking for clarification. 

'Unreasonable': Body Art says that it is a breach of his human rights that he needs to put his birth name on the passport, even though his new name is on his driver's licence

Staying put: The Lib Dem activist's application to renew his passport was rejected on the basis of his name, and he may now miss out job opportunities abroad at body modification conventions

Mr
 Hemming said: ‘Obviously there do need to be limits on what names are 
acceptable for public documents but these limits should be consistent 
and the policy as to what is acceptable should be clear.

‘I have written to the passport agency to see why they take a different view from the DVLA.’

A spokeswoman for the Passport Office said they did not comment on individual cases.

The
 office's policy on names reads: ‘Where an applicant changes his or her 
name to a string of words or phrases that would not normally be 
recognised as a name, this should not be entered onto the personal 
details page of the passport.

‘For
 example, the names "New Year" "Happy Easter" or "Good Bye" are 
unacceptable as, when put together, they became a recognised phrase or 
saying.’
