The most amazing thing about Murray State University pitcher John Lollar's ridiculous wind-up is that it feels totally natural to him.

Before every pitch the 6-foot-1 lefty kicks his leg so high it appears for a moment that he's doing the vertical splits. 

Lollar gained attention last week during his game against the University of Kentucky when a photographer for scouting site AllWildcats.com captured a shot of him at the height of his wind-up.

John Lollar became an internet sensation for his incredible wind-up mechanics that show him kicking his leg up to his head for every pitch

The Murray State University pitcher, seen here on spring break with girlfriend Haley Atkins, lost the game to the Wildcats, but won national attention for his unique movement

The sophomore appeared to defy not just bio-mechanics and physiology, but also the laws of physics. 

He told Yahoo Sports: 'My dad always told me to do whatever felt natural and whatever came easy for me.'

He says he's emulating Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan - who surely had a high leg kick, though nothing like Lollar's. 

Despite exaggerated mechanics, of his pitch, Lollar was unable to hold off the Wildcats. He gave up four runs on eight hits over five innings. 

Murray State fell 4-1. 

But the result didn't matter. The picture made him famous overnight - for something he says was perfectly natural to him.
