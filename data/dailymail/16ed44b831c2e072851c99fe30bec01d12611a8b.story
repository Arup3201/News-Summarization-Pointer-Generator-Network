Militants from the Islamic State launched an attack on Kobane from Turkey for the first time today - indicating that the Syrian border town is now totally surrounded. 

The clashes, which killed at least 30 fighters, began when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives while driving an armoured vehicle across the border, Kurdish officials have said.

Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said the terror group 'used to attack the town from three sides. Today, they are attacking from four sides'. 

Turkey denied the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

A Turkish government statement today confirmed that one of the suicide attacks involved a bomb-loaded vehicle that detonated on the Syrian side of the border.

But it denied claims that the vehicle had crossed into Kobane through Turkey, which would be a first for the extremist fighters.

It said: 'Claims that the vehicle reached the border gate by crossing through Turkish soil are a lie.

'Contrary to certain claims, no Turkish official has made any statement claiming that the bomb-loaded vehicle had crossed in from Turkey.

'The security forces who are on alert in the border region have ...  taken all necessary measures.'

It is understood that a total of four suicide bombers blew themselves up amid the clashes, which killed at least 30 fighters.

Witnesses reported seeing thick black smoke rise over Kobane during the attack. 

The sound of heavy gunfire echoed through the surrounding hills as armored vehicles took up positions on the border. 

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said heavy fighting also took place southwest of the town where the Islamic State group brought in tanks to reinforce their fighters.

Mustafa Bali, a Kobane-based activist, said  that Islamic State group fighters have taken positions in the grain silos on the Turkish side of the border and from there are launching attacks toward the border crossing point.

He added that the U.S.-led coalition launched an airstrike Saturday morning on the eastern side of the town.

He said: 'It is now clear that Turkey is openly cooperating with Daesh,' using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.

The Islamic State group began its Kobane offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. 

The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish slowly have been advancing slowly in Kobane since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. 

The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months. The Observatory said the latest fighting killed at least eight Kurdish fighters and 17 jihadis.
