Not all home owners have enjoyed the famed big returns of Sydney's property boom, analysts reveal.

While median home prices have leapt by at least 30 per cent across Sydney, home prices in some of the city's more 'prestigious', mostly waterfront postcodes have hardly budged in the last two years. 

Analysts say this is because higher-end buyers and sellers are more influenced by fluctuations in the stock market than by low interest rates which sparked the boom in budget and middle sectors of the market.

The median price of 'prestige' properties in Burraneer, a waterfront suburb south of Sydney's CBD, grew the least of all Sydney suburbs over the last two years

The median price of Burraneer, south of Sydney, is more than $1.5million. This Burraneer home is on the market for an estimated $6.5 million

Seaforth on Sydney's Northern beaches, was ranked the fourth worst performing suburb for luxury sales by Domain Group

Analysts say market conditions haven't suited 'prestigious property', like this $6.5 million Burraneer home, since the GFC

Sydney's eastern suburbs, the northern beaches and the north shore are among the poorest performing suburbs in terms of price growth over the last two years. 

'This is the section that has missed out on the boom,' says Domain Group senior economist Andrew Wilson. 

Burraneer 3.4% 

Bronte 7.9%

Sylvania Waters 8.3%

Seaforth 8.4%

Woollahra 8.9%

Windsor 9.6%

Balgowlah Heights 10.7%

Elanora Heights 10.9%

Haberfield 12.3 %

Rope's Crossing 12.4 %

He says Sydney's booming prices have been driven by buyers in the budget and middle sectors of the market taking advantage of low interest rates. 

But market conditions haven't suited 'prestige property' since the 2007 Global Financial Crisis (GFC)

'We don't have the animal spirit, speculative elements in those markets [that we did before the GFC],' Mr Wilson said. 

In the waterfront suburb of Burraneer, south of the city, house prices have grown less than inflation at only 3.4 per cent in the last two years. 

The popular eastern suburbs beach suburb of Bronte grew only 7.9 per cent and the Northern Beaches suburbs of Seaforth and Balgowlah Heights grew just 8.4 per cent  and 10.7 per cent respectively, according to data from Domain Group. 

Despite the low growth, property agents like James McCowan, from Sotheby's International Realty, say there is still a 'lot of strength' in the very top end of the market - with  homes worth more than $8 million selling well. 

Woollahra was ranked the fifth worst performing suburb in terms of median home price growth over the last two years. Woollahra is also one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs, with this home currently on the market valued at more than $1.6 million

The median house price in Bronte, the second worst performing suburb for price growth, is $2.29 million. Agents of this Bronte home  describe it as a 'chance-of-a-lifetime' purchase for its 'fashionable beachfront lifestyle'

This Sylvania Waters home is estimated to sell for at least $1.4 million. Medium house prices in Sylvania Waters crept up only 8.3% over the last two years, a far cry from the Sydney-wide figure of at least 30%
