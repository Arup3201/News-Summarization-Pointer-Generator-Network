Barack Obama today traded insults with Hangover star Zach Galifianakis in a hilarious episode of the Funny or Die satirical sketch show.

The President joked about his birth certificate, his basketball skills and the merits of the Hangover movies as he appeared on the show to promote the Affordable Care Act.

The sketch series Between Two Ferns runs on Will Ferrell’s comedy site is a cult hit, with Galifianakis regularly interrupting and insulting the guests with inappropriate questions.

Starting it off on the wrong foot: 'Between Two Ferns' is set up to look like a poorly-funded public access program

Who laughed first: The President couldn't keep a straight face like Galifianakis

His sit-down with the President was no different, and Mr Obama’s speech writing team clearly had fun setting up some insults of his own.

‘You said if you had a son, you would not let him play football. What makes you think he would want to play football? What if he was a nerd like you?’ Galifianakis  said.

Galifianakis: Sorry I had to cancel a few times- my mouse pad broke last week and I had to get my great aunt some diabetes shoes

Galifianakis: First question: In 2013, you pardoned a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014?                                                Obama: We'll probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that depressing to you? One turkey taken out of circulation- one turkey you couldn't eat?

Galifianakis: I would make same sex divorce illegal and then see how bad they want it. Obama: I think that's why you're not president, and that's a good thing. 

Galifianakis: So how does this work? Do you send Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that you would be sending Hulk Hogan to Syria- or is that more of a job for Tonya Harding?

Galifianakis: (Healthcare.gov) That's the thing that doesn't work? Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?

‘Do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd?’ Obama said. 

Galifianakis  followed up by asking to check with the First Lady himself, but that was quickly dismissed: ‘No I'm not going to let her near you,’ Obama said.

The tone of the interview, which is set up like a poorly-funded public access program, was set from the very beginning as Galifianakis  apologized for having to cancel ‘a few times- my mousepad broke last week and I had to get my great aunt some diabetes shoes’.

‘I have to say when I heard that people actually watch this show I was pretty surprised,’ Obama said.

A text scroll then introduced the President to viewers as ‘Barack Obama (SP?) Community Organizer’.

The
 majority of the 6-minute short was a series of barbs between the two 
men, with the President criticizing Galifianakis ’ weight and his 
‘insecurities’ around his Hangover co-star Bradley Cooper. 

‘First question: In 2013, you pardoned a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014?’ Galifianakis  asked.

‘We'll
 probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that
 depressing to you? One turkey taken out of circulation- one turkey you 
couldn't eat?’ Obama said.

When
 Galifianakis  said that he must be upset that his second term is nearly
 over, the President turned the issue around on the comedian.

‘If I ran a third time it'd sorta be like doing a third Hangover movie- didn't really work out, did it?’ he said.

It wasn’t a one-sided war of words, however, as Galifianakis  brought his trademark abrasive persona.

‘So how does this work? Do you send 
Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that 
you would be sending Hulk Hogan to Syria- or is that more of a job for 
Tonya Harding?’ he said.

‘Where are you planning on building your presidential library- in Hawaii or in your home country of Kenya?’

Later
 when Obama began talking about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act,
 Galifianakis  interrupted him by saying: ‘Is this what they mean by 
drones?’

‘(Healthcare.gov) That's the thing that doesn't work? Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?’

The big reveal: At the end, the President pushed the red button and the backdrop fell to the ground showing that they were in the Diplomatic Room of the White House

The skit ended when Obama pressed the red button that was a seemingly random addition to the set, and the black backdrop subsequently fell to the ground, revealing that the short was being filmed in the White House Diplomatic Room.

Galifianakis  said that he had been filming in the White House since the Bush administration.

Funny Or Die is run by Adam McKay and Will Farrell, who has appeared in videos promoting healthy eating with Mrs Obama. 

Galifianakis has only one record of making a political donation, and that went to North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat.
