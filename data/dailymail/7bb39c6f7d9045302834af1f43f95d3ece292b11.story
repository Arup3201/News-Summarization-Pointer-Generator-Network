Fine time: A total of 6.8million parking tickets were handed out by councils last year - up from 6.5million in 2010

Motorists are being hit with parking fines every 4.6 seconds as the number of penalties issued to drivers soars, research reveals.

A total of 6.8million parking tickets were handed out by  councils last year – up from 6.5million in 2010.

But a quarter of parking tickets are disputed, with 39 per cent of challenges succeeding.

The rise comes despite a 5 per cent fall in the number of traffic wardens from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 last year.

The findings come from Freedom of Information requests to 71 councils by the insurer Swiftcover.com.

The figures showed parking fines rose from 6,585,411 in 2010 to 6,831,666 last year – a 3.7 per cent increase of 246,255, ‘equivalent to one every 4.6 seconds’, according to the report.

The 131,378 fines handed out every week last year generated at least £234million for councils.

Across London, a total of 4,124,561 fines were issued last year – up 3.6 per cent on the  previous year.

Outside the capital, Liverpool (146,503), Manchester (138,558) and Birmingham (132,684) city councils issued the highest number of fines.

This is based on a minimum fine after early payment discount of £25 outside of London and £40 in the capital.

Further research found that 51 per cent of motorists turn  their backs on their local high streets because of the difficulties posed by parking.

On average, 74,257 fines were handed out by each local council last year, compared to 72,367 in 2010.

But the report says that as fines soared, the number of local council traffic wardens of ‘Civil Enforcement Officers’ fell from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 in 2011 – a drop of around 5 per cent.

The busiest traffic wardens were found in Liverpool, handing out an average of 2,616 parking fines each in 2011. They were followed by those in Coventry (2,220) and Worcester (2,125).

That's the ticket: A total of 4,124,561 tickets where handed out in London last year up 3.6 per cent on the previous year

The lowest proportion of fines were in Sunderland where each traffic warden handed out just 296 fines on average.

But higher numbers of fines also led to an increase in disputes by motorists. In 2010 some 1,677,043 parking ticket disputes were lodged with local councils and Transport for London.

In 2011 that figure rose to 1,758,571 – or 146,547 each month.

However, the success rate of these challenges has fallen - from 47 per cent (780,710 tickets overturned) in 2010 to 39 per cent (683,218 tickets overturned) in 2011.

Success rates in disputed cases vary dramatically by local council. They range from as little as 11 per cent in the City of Bradford, to 72 per cent in Chichester. More than third (36 per cent) of Manchester motorists who disputed a ticket were successful, while 41 per cent of appeals were upheld in Birmingham.

Further research by swiftcover.com revealed that parking in their nearest town or city centre has become more difficult for two thirds (66 per cent) of motorists.

Battle: While 39 per cent of motorists that challenged fines last year were successful, that success rate was down from 47 per cent in the year prior

It is forcing more than half (51 per cent) of shoppers to turn their backs on their local high-street.

And six out of ten (61 per cent) of 17 to 24 year olds do not now shop in their local town,

Robin Reames, chief claims officer at swiftcover.com, said: ‘Shortage of parking has become a huge issue in towns and cities across the UK in the past five to ten years. However, this doesn’t excuse illegal parking.

Although it might be an easy option to park on a double yellow for a short time, it’s potentially dangerous as well as being illegal, and can result in a fine.

‘Furthermore, if your illegally parked car is a hazard and a moving vehicle crashed in to it, an insurer could in theory request up to a third of the bill from the at fault motorist.’

Insurers are entitled to request for up to a third of the cost of an accident if the policyholder is proven to have parked illegally and in a hazardous way, although the firm insists this is ‘extremely rate.’
