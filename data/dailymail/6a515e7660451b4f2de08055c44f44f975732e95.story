Wantaway Southampton striker Pablo Osvaldo is poised to complete a loan move to Inter Milan, with Algeria international Saphir Taider going in the opposite direction. 

Osvaldo's days at St Mary's have been numbered since he was involved in a training ground bust-up with Saints defender Jose Fonte last season, and he spent the subsequent months of the campaign on loan at Serie A champions Juventus. 

On Tuesday Southampton were negotiating a deal that will see the fiery Italian move to San Siro on loan for the 2014-15 season.

As part of the agreement between the two clubs, Algerian midfielder Taider will spend the same time on loan with the Premier League side. 

The 22-year-old made two appearances for his national side in Brazil, against eventual champions Germany and dark horses Belgium. 

Taider made 25 appearances in Serie A for Inter last season, but many of those came off the bench.

Meanwhile, Genoa have opened talks with Tottenham over a deal for the club's Spanish winger Iago Falque, who has struggled to leave his mark at White Hart Lane since joining the club in 2011.
