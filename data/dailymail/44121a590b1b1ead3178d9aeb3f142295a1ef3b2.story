Police in Utah arrested an elderly military veteran Tuesday morning following an 11-hour standoff that required the involvement of a SWAT team armed with powdered pepper spray.

The suspect, who has not been named, allegedly fired a gun inside a recreational vehicle at around 12.30am in St. George.

Police responded to the mobile home after getting a 911 call about shots fired, but the suspect barricaded himself inside the RV.

Tense standoff: A St. George Police officer maintains his position surrounding a trailer home after reports of shots fired on Tuesday in St. George, Utah

Peaceful resolution: St. George police officers take a military veteran into custody after an 11-hour standoff

Trick: Cops had to resort to the use of powdered pepper spray in order to coax the man out of his RV 

Smoked out: The elderly man came out of the RV on his own after police launched more pepper spray at his home 

The veteran surrendered to police at around 11am after a SWAT team fired powdered pepper spray into the camper.

The standoff resulted in the closure of nearby businesses, and people in a motel were told to stay in their rooms.

According to the St George Police Department, the suspect fired about six shots inside his RV parked on East St. George Boulevard shortly after midnight.

A SWAT team accompanied by crisis negotiators converged on the RV, and officers spent the next 10 hours trying to make contact with the man barricaded inside to coax him out, but to no avail.

As time passed and police had not heard anything from the man, they decided to fire powdered pepper spray, known as OC powder, into the trailer to draw him out.

The man was seen tossing items out the window and screaming at the cops, 'You are hurting me!' reported The Spectrum. 

How it started: The suspect allegedly fired several shots inside his mobile home, pictured, at around midnight

Closures: Police shut down St George Boulevard and several local businesses during the standoff 

At that point, the veteran made contact with the SWAT team outside, but then the communication went silent again, prompting police to launch more pepper spray into the camper.

At around 11.15am, the gray-haired veteran walked out of the RV and was taken into custody without incident.

There was no one else inside the man's mobile home, and no injuries have been reported.

If the suspect qualifies, his case will be heard in the veteran judicial court.

St George Boulevard was shut down for several hours during the ordeal, along with a nearby Rite Aid pharmacy and a coffee and juice bar.
