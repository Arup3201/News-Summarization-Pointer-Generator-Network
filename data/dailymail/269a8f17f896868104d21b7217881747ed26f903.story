One restaurant has launched a 'hate us on Yelp' campaign, rewarding diners who've left negative reviews with a discount.

Botto Bistro in Richmond, California, which is in protest of Yelp's alleged practice of manipulating ratings, is hoping to prove that nasty reviews won't impact its success.

The Italian eatery is offering a 25per cent discount on its pizzas to anyone who gives it just one star, and plans to share the funniest insults in its newsletter at the end of the month.

The author of the winning review will also receive a free ticket for its cooking classes.

'You can lie or tell the truth, make it hilarious, tell the world how horrible our establishment is, talk about the toilet seat temperature, the aliens in our bathrooms, how much you hate our food, and so on,' Botto Bistro's website advises.

One tongue-in-cheek Yelp review reads: '1. They don't deliver to Los Angeles. It's only 6-8 hours away depending on traffic. 2. Brad Pitt doesn't work there :( was hoping to see him. 3. They asked what I wanted, I said "world peace" and they didn't deliver.'

Another complaint says: 'My boyfriend took me here for dinner the other night, and I totally thought he was going to propose... but he DIDN'T. Obviously this is the restaurant's fault, and not the fact that I purposefully killed his pet goldfish the other day and frequently read his emails in order to find out if he's cheating on me.'

A third one reads: ‘My food arrived before I wanted it to come. It was too hot to eat. It brought back all kinds of terrible memories of eating in Italy.’ 

The restaurant explains its reason for encouraging the hilariously absurd feedback on its website.

'Our goal? We want to be the restaurant with the lowest score on Yelp, we want to be the worst! Why? We want to prove that low score and bad reviews don't impact us and any other successful restaurants,' it says.

Feeding frenzy: The restaurant's Yelp page is now full of sarcastic grievances, such as 'It brought back all kinds of terrible memories of eating in Italy’

'We have heard many stories about Yelp threatening businesses and forcing them to advertise with them. Over the last few years we have received some of those phone calls too.

Botto Bistro's owner, Davide Cerretini, told ABC News that Yelp emailed him on Monday with the following message:

'If you are offering incentives in exchange for reviews, we ask that you immediately discontinue such activity. If we learn that this type of behavior has continued, we may take action on your Business Account which could include suspending access to your listing. It may also result in a Consumer Alert being placed on your listing.'

Cerretini said he sarcastically responded: 'I'm contacting you from the Botto User Support Team because we've received complaints from the community that you may be removing reviews in exchange of vague explanations to loyal customers.'

Yelp has denied claims by small business owners that it manipulates ratings based on whether businesses are advertisers.

Two weeks ago, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that even if the site did manipulate reviews to penalize businesses, it would not constitute extortion.

The court said that Yelp has no obligation to publish positive reviews, and that the company can seek payments for its advertising.
