My colleague Martin Keown was right. Marko Arnautovic’s push on Mathieu Debuchy when Stoke City played Arsenal was cowardly and dangerous, and should have been dealt with more harshly.

Rugby union has very simple rules governing the protection of a player in the air. He cannot be hit and, if he is, anything from a spell in the sin bin to a full-blown dismissal can result, depending on the severity of the event.

The shove by Stoke City's Marko Arnautovic that sent Arsenal's Mathieu Debuchy flying in the hoardings

Arnautovic pushed Debuchy when he was unable to control his momentum or fall and he is now out for three months after colliding with perimeter advertising.

A three-match ban would still be a let-off, by comparison. Nothing, which is what Arnautovic received from referee Jonathan Moss, means the practice will only be encouraged.

I am surprised that more was not made of Marko Arnautovic’s cowardly push on Mathieu Debuchy. The Stoke man shoved Debuchy while he was in mid-air and now Arsenal’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding. 

On Tuesday when West Ham’s Morgan Amalfitano shoved Leighton Baines, the Everton defender was lucky to escape injury.

It is a cheap shot, it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me. I fractured my shoulder playing against Italy when somebody shoved me when I was already falling. It leaves you no time to brace yourself.

Gary Cahill was shoved into Joe Hart while playing for England against Belgium. He broke his jaw and missed Euro 2012.

It can look innocuous, but it’s a deliberate act and must stop. If you hit the hoarding, it’s like being shoved into a brick wall.
