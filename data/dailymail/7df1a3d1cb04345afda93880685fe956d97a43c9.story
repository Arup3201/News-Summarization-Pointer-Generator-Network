West Ham United have come in for criticism from their own supporters for selling mugs and t-shirts celebrating their three wins over rivals Tottenham last season.

The Hammers' official club store have advertised the merchandise emblazoned with the slogan, The Treble: It's Happened Again.

The Treble: West Ham have released this t-shirt celebrating their three wins over Spurs in the 2013-14 season

Tea and easy: The Hammers have also brought out a mug to mark the three wins

West Ham released a DVD after Tottenham were shocked 3-0 at home in the Barclays Premier League in October, and it only got worse for Spurs as the season went on.

They were knocked out of the Capital One Cup at White Hart Lane by the Hammers in December before losing 2-0 at Upton Park in the League in May.

But it was an otherwise abject season for Sam Allardyce's side though as they finished 13th with 40 points, having come 10th with 46 the season before.

Tottenham, in contrast, finished sixth with 69 points - 29 ahead of their London rivals.

A West Ham fans' Twitter account, @whustuff, posted a picture of the shirt with the words: 'Beating them was nice but this is embarrassing.'

West Ham fan Mick Lewsey replied: 'It makes us look like a small club, to produce s**t like that for beating another PL team.'

West Ham revealed last month that Sam Allardyce would be staying on as manager next season despite heavy criticism from some fans.

The former Bolton boss has been told that he must promote a more attractive brand of football.

Ex-England and Hammers forward Teddy Sheringham has been brought in as an attacking coach to try and do so.
