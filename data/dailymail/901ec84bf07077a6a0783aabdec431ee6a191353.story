A 57-year-old woman who was found mauled to death by two neighbor's dogs last week had complained to police on at least nine

occasions about the vicious dogs.

Friends and co-workers of Klonda Richey say she lived in fear of her neighbor's two Bullmastiffs, both of which were shot Friday by police after they found Richey's naked body strewn outside her house.

Documents filed with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department and Animal Resource Center show that Richey reported her neighbors terrorizing dogs on several occasions.

ARC director Mark Kumpf said he was aware of nine complaints about the dogs responsible for her death.

Richey called to complain about the dogs at least six times, and her concerns were mostly related to their barking: 'Dog is straining to get to water and food that are empty, advised is ongoing issue'.

'We are aware of additional complaints, unfortunately, the owners have never responded to any of our calls to the best of our knowledge. We are looking into this matter,' Kumpf said.

'She's always been terrified of those dogs,' coworker Tim Bridwell told the Dayton Daily News. 'She told me, and a lot of other people, she was afraid those dogs were going to kill her.'

Richey's lacerated body was found naked on snow-covered Bruce Avenue, Dayton about 8:15am, thrashed by her next door neighbors' male mixed breed Bullmastiffs.

Richey's next-door neighbors, 28-year-old Andrew Nason and 23-year-old Julie Custer, were taken into custody after the attack.

'My right hand man!' Julie Custer, who was arrested over the death of her neighbor, posted a picture of this dog to her Facebook page in 2012

They were released Sunday evening as the investigation is on going.

WDTN reported Custer, a Wright State University nursing graduate and mother, was the registered owner of the dogs.

The Montgomery County Coroner's Office has not released a cause of death yet.

Mourners have started putting up flowers outside Richey's home as a memorial.

News of the shocking incident has devastated Richey's family and friends, who they described as a caring person who doted on her 20 cats.

She had worked at Montgomery County Job & Family Services Administration Services Division for 25 years.

'It's so ironic that this devout animal lover would be killed by animals in such a brutal aggressive way,' colleague Ann Stevens said.

'Every conversation I had with Klonda included cats - she was very passionate about animals and their well being and because of that she always had a special place in my heart.'

Richey was also an active Republican party volunteer, according to Dayton Daily News, and campaigned for Mitt Romney.

Rob Scott, former chairman of the Montgomery County Republican party, met Richey when he became chairman of the party in April 2012.

'She was always smiling and upbeat and positive, I never heard her say one negative thing about anyone,' he said.

'She always looked on the positive side of life.'

It is understood Richey lived alone in her clapboard home with her beloved cats.

In the wake of Friday's attack, Montgomery County Animal Control Resource Center officers removed her cats, which were well cared for.

They are reportedly being adopted by her friends.
