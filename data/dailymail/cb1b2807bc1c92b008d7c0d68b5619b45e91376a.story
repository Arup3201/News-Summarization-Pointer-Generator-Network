Zinedine Zidane could be banned from coaching for six months if found guilty of managing Real Madrid’s B-team without the correct license.

Spain’s national association of coaches CENAFE made a complaint about the former World Cup winner at the start of the season and now the country’s Competitions Committee is studying the possibility that Real Madrid have broken rule 104 of their code which could lead to a ban of between four and 16 games or one to six months.

Real Madrid Castilla – as the B-team is known – have claimed that Sergio Sanchez is the first coach and Zidane only his number two. But the Frenchman’s accusers have presented documental and video evidence to suggest that this is not the case and that the former Real Madrid player is carrying out the work of the first coach.

First coaches in Spain need to have a level 3 national coaching diploma and Zidane, who this week admitted he would one day like to coach the French national team, is still to obtain the relevant qualification.

Madrid’s B-team have suffered in recent years with relegation to the third tier of Spanish football last season and they are currently third from bottom of Group II of the Second division B having lost three of their first four games.

The president of CENAFE Miguel Galán, the body that made the original complaint, said: 'Real Madrid is one of the most recognisable sporting institutions in the world and a symbol of this sport but they have to follow the same rules as everyone else otherwise the competition is not fair.'
