The Rangers Supporters Trust have issued a rallying call to fans ahead of the club's forthcoming extraordinary general meeting called to implement boardroom change.

However, the supporters' body was dealt a blow when they were informed they could not take any legal proceedings against shareholder Mike Ashley following his reported bid to get security over Ibrox and Murray Park.

The Newcastle United owner filed documents notifying land registry he plans to add his company, Sports Direct, to the title deeds of the club's stadium and training ground, with the thought that he is about to offer the cash-strapped Govan club a loan.

The Ibrox soap opera took another twist on Friday when Rangers' largest shareholder Dave King called for an EGM. Later in the evening Gers fans demonstrated outside the ground against Ashley and the board before the game against Hearts, which was abandoned due to freezing conditions.

South African-based businessman King wants Ashley's allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach, as well as chairman David Somers and non-executive director James Easdale, removed from the board with immediate effect.

While the future of the Scottish Championship club remains up in the air, the RST issued a statement outlining their position.

The statement read: 'The Rangers Supporters Trust has, at considerable time and expense over the past two days, taken detailed legal advice over the recent move by the Rangers board to give notice of intention to grant security over Ibrox to Sports Direct.

One of the supporter's flags read: 'Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites'

'It is the opinion of both our senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors that we can take no further action at this time.

'It is quite clear from their detailed examination of statements made by the board regarding Ibrox that, whilst giving the impression to fans and shareholders that they were making a commitment not to grant security over Ibrox, the board was in fact meticulously careful not to stray into language which would actually give such a legal commitment.

'We believe the effect of those statements was to be deliberately misleading.

'We have however been advised of various possible remedies, including those against individual directors, which may be available to us should the board actually go ahead and grant the security. We will continue to monitor this very, very closely.

'We are extremely angry that we are in a position where we are having to explore legal remedies in order to try to stop Rangers directors from acting in their own interests and those of Mr Ashley, rather than the shareholders and fans of Rangers.

The protest was a response to advance notices of security over Ibrox being lodged on behalf of Sports Direct

'We did not take this step lightly but we are committed not only to increasing fan involvement in the club through purchasing shares, but also to defending the club, the stadium, the fans and the thousands of small, fan shareholders from the disgraceful actions of David Somers, Sandy and James Easdale, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach.

'We hope the vast majority of shareholders and fans will back us in this endeavour and we have to ask for their help.

'An EGM has now been called by Dave King. The only way we can carry on our work to try to save Ibrox and reclaim the club is by the supporters backing us and signing up in large numbers to the RST.

'Every single vote at the upcoming AGM will be crucial and you can make a difference. Please visit www.therst.co.uk/buyrangers and either join us or use the donate option on the site. All donations will go towards legal costs or the purchase of shares in Rangers.

'Together we can save our stadium and take back our club. It's up to you.'
