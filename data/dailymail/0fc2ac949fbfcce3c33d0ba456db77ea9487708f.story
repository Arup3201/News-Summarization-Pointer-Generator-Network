'A natural friend': Augustine Carnell was killed on a dual carriageway in Maidstone, Kent

A teenage private schoolboy died after being hit by a taxi as he tried to get home from a New Year’s Eve party.

Augustine Carnell was walking along a dual carriageway in Maidstone, Kent, when he was hit at around 3.30am on January 1.

The 17-year-old, a pupil at the £16,600-a-year King’s School Rochester, had been to a party. It is believed the A-Level student was trying to get home.

He was hit on the A229 in Maidstone, around six miles from his home in Rochester, and died at the scene.

Police
 confirmed he was hit by a white Skoda Rapid car and that the driver, 
who was not arrested, had stopped immediately after the accident.

One witness, calling himself RJT, said: 'I was a witness to this tragic accident.

'I immediately called 999 but a car was on the way down. I tried to flag him down but could not and witnessed the impact.

'I was in shock but still managed to check for a pulse and police were on site within 3 minutes.

'The car was a taxi and there is no question of him being hunted as he stopped and has been interviewed. I also have in car video footage of most of the incident although not the actual impact which is now with the police.

'My heart goes out to his family. I just wanted to clarify things and I am still shocked by what I witnessed that night.'

Mr Carnell's family said he will live ‘forever in our hearts, our prayers and dreams’.

In a statement, they said: ‘A kind, gentle, happy 17 year old boy full of fun and humour. He always made people feel welcome and at ease – a natural friend. He was a keen rugby player, both at King’s and Aylesford Bulls. He was a CCF Air Cadet and Explorer Scout with Shorne Scout Troup.

‘A qualified scuba diver, Mr Carnell completed a coral conservation diving project in 2012. He loved animals, our dogs, ducks, fish and his bearded dragon.

‘Augustine died tragically on Bluebell Hill after leaving a New Year’s Eve party; he was involved in a collision with a car and died instantly.

‘His family love him so very much. He is with Jesus now, but he will be with us forever in our hearts, our prayers and dreams.

‘Funeral arrangement details will be provided to his friends and family.’

Jeremy Walker, the headmaster of King’s School Rochester, called the incident 'devastating'.

The school released a statement paying tribute to the ‘charismatic’ schoolboy.

‘Augustine Carnell was a pupil at King’s Rochester from the age of four years old and his death is a very great loss to every member of the school. His vivacious personality, his ready smile, his positive presence in class and his many contributions to school life are just some of his qualities that we will all miss,' it said.

‘Augustine was an active member of the CCF, played rugby for the 1st XV and had completed his Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and Grade 5 on piano.  In addition he had many interests outside school including scuba-diving and the Scouts.  Last summer he took part in a coral reef conservation project in Florida where his commitment and humour made a great impression on his group.

‘Augustine
 was a charismatic young man with a charming manner and a great sense of
 fun.  His ability to relate to everyone he met, whether young or old, 
meant that he had a wide circle of friends and was liked and respected 
by all who had the privilege of knowing him.

‘Augustine
 set a true example of how to live life to the full and will be deeply 
missed and fondly remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers are very much 
with his family and friends.’

A spokesman for Kent Police said officers were appealing for witnesses to come forward.

He said: 'At 3.30am on Wednesday, 1 January 2014, a 17 year old boy from the Rochester area was believed to be walking home along the Maidstone-bound carriageway near the Shell service station when he came into collision with a white Skoda Rapid.

'Sadly he suffered fatal injuries as a result of the collision.

'Officers from the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit attended the scene and have commenced an investigation into the circumstances of the collision.'

The Medway and Mid Kent coroner has been informed and a post mortem examination is due to be carried out next week.
