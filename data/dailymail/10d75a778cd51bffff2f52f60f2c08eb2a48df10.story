Everyday life is a battle for the animals that call Kenya's Masai Mara home.

And one holidaymaker's pictures sum up life for a pride of lions more than most, after he spent hours crouched by 30 feet from the big cats to capture their interactions on camera. 

Saudi equity trader Mohammed Alnaser captured the intimate shots by carefully observing the animals for six hours while on safari.

Mum and dad bare their fearsome jaws at one another; it's difficult to tell whether this is meant to be a show of affection

It's playtime for the lion cubs, yet the one on the far right appears to want to distance themselves from the fun

After having a bit of fun, the mother lion comes to calm her young down and moves on to pastures new

He caught amazing action shots of a family, consisting of two adults and three cubs, going about their daily lives, playfighting, bickering and tucking into food. 

'I love lions so much, they are my favourite animals,' said 36-year-old Mohammed.

'I try my best to capture the rare moments particularly the unique expressions or emotions shown by lions.

'They are very compassionate and show a lot of love to each other.'

The famous Masai Mara National Reserve is thought to be home to around wild 600 lions, with the world's second highest population density of these magnificent predators.

However, tragically there numbers are believed to have dropped by 20 per cent in their past 30 years thanks to hunting and the destruction of the herds of wildebeest and other game they depend on for survival.

This cub appears to have got on the wrong end of playtime, as they are left battered and bruised

It's time for some gentle nuzzling by the male adult as the pride seem tired out by their efforts

'It is totally different seeing animals in the wild when compared to visiting them in zoos,' added Mohammed.

'I always come across people who are visiting Africa for the first time.

'It is always nice to see their reaction when they see incredible wildlife moments for themselves.

'They become very happy and excited about it.'

In a battle of who is the fiercest, it's difficult to separate the mother and father lion at the Kenyan reserve
