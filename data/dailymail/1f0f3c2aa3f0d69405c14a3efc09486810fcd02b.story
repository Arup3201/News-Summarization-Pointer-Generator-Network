A multiple sclerosis patient who suffered from terrible tremors has been successfully treated - thanks to an implant inserted into his head.

Father-of-one Graham Collinson, 43, was plagued by vicious tremors down the right side of his body after developing the neurological condition.

They stopped him from carrying out simple everyday tasks such as getting dressed or picking money out of his wallet.

Graham Collinson, 43, had surgery to insert electrodes into his brain to control a severe tremor in his right side. The electrodes can be controlled using a portable device (pictured) which turns them on and off

But after undergoing a risky and complicated operation to fit electrodes into his brain, he can enjoy a better standard of life.

The operation is a treatment frequently used for Parkinson’s disease patients.

Mr Collinson, from Hartlepool, said: ‘I’ve got a quality of life back that I thought I had lost forever.

‘I want to thank the amazing surgeons who have made a world of difference to my life.

‘They’ve given me my quality of life back, the ability to do simple everyday tasks that I thought I would never be able to do again. The device is my own miniature miracle.’

With his condition deteriorating and the tremor down the right side of his body getting worse, Mr Collinson was briefed about the possibility of undergoing the surgery last year.

After deliberating over whether to go ahead with the treatment, he decided he had nothing to lose.

He underwent deep brain stimulation surgery in September 2013 at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

The procedure that involves the surgeon implanting leads, which have electrodes at the end, into the brain.

The leads are then tunnelled under the skin to a device similar to a pacemaker which is fitted in the chest or stomach area.

It is thought that about 25 to 60 per cent of MS patients have a tremor.

This is a trembling or shaking movement that the patient cannot control.

It is usually a back-and-forth shaking movement but the tremor can also be irregular and unpredictable.

It is often described as one of the more difficult symptoms of MS to manage but occupational therapy and drug treatments can help in some cases.

The treatment Mr Collinson had is called deep brain stimulation.

It involved electrodes being inserted into his brain attached to a device similar to a pacemaker.

When the device is switched on, the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain that causes the tremor reducing or preventing it.

When switched on, the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain which helps to control the tremors.

Mr Collinson can now carry out simple everyday tasks that he had been unable to do for the last three years.

He said: ‘My tremor hasn’t completely disappeared, obviously, but it’s so much better than it was. I have had to get used to a worsening tremor since my diagnosis.

‘The surgeon told me about this treatment but warned me of the risks. There was a risk of suffering a stroke, a brain bleed or getting an infection in the brain.

‘I put it off for a while but with my tremor getting worse fast I thought I had nothing to lose and said I wanted to go for it.

‘I never had any idea it would improve my quality of life so much. Things like getting dressed, brushing my teeth, fastening zips, getting money out of a wallet.

‘They all seem like such simple everyday tasks but I couldn’t do any of them. Now I can, it’s just made a world of difference.

‘On a morning when I switch it on I can feel it in my head as the power surges through.

‘I can feel a slight electric shock as well. But that’s a small price to pay to get my quality of life back.’

Multiple sclerosis is a condition which affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord causing a range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement, balance and vision.

In some cases, it also causes severe tremors.

The condition occurs when the protein around each nerve fibre in the brain and spinal cord is damaged. This disrupts the transfer of nerve signals and cause symptoms.
