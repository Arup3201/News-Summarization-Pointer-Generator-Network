Swiss surgeons have successfully rebuilt the noses of five skin cancer patients using their own tissue.

The team rebuilt patients’ nostrils using a revolutionary technique in which cells were taken from their nasal septum.

One year later, all recipients were satisfied with their ability to breathe as well as the cosmetic appearance, and did not report any side effects.

Growing noses: The Swiss team grew white, glossy cartilage in the laboratory after taking cells from the patients' nasal septum, and were able to build new nostrils for five skin cancer patients

The nose is the most common place for skin cancers other than melanoma, because of its exposure to sunlight.

Surgeons are often forced to cut away parts of cartilage from the nasal septum, ear or rib as grafts to functionally reconstruct the area from where the tumour has been removed.

But this painful and invasive procedure involves major additional surgery, and has been associated with complications at the site from which cartilage has been removed.

The Swiss researchers attempted an alternative method by extracting the cartilage cells, called chondrocytes, from the nasal septum of each patient.

After multiplying the cells using growth factors for two weeks, they were seeded onto collagen membranes that act as a framework or scaffold for new tissue and cultured in the lab for a further fortnight.

This generated cartilage 40 times larger than the original biopsy.

When the engineered grafts were ready they were shaped according to the defect and implanted, reports The Lancet.

Professor Ivan Martin, from the University of Basel in Switzerland, said: ‘The engineered cartilage had clinical results comparable to the current standard surgery.

'This new technique could help the 
body to accept the new tissue better and to improve the stability and 
functionality of the nostril.

'Our
 success is based on the long-standing, effective integration in Basel 
between our experimental group at the Department of Biomedicine and the 
surgical disciplines at the University Hospital.’

He
 said the breakthrough opens the way to using engineered cartilage for 
more challenging reconstructions in facial surgery such as the complete 
nose, eyelid or ear.

The same engineered grafts are currently being tested in a parallel study for articular cartilage repair in the knee.

However,
 Prof Martin added: ‘Despite this optimism, the use of these procedures 
in the routine clinical practice is still rather distant, as it requires
 rigorous assessment of efficacy on larger cohorts of patients, and the 
development of business models and manufacturing paradigms that will 
guarantee cost effectiveness.’
