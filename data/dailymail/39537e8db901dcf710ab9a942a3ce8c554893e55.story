A pair of self-proclaimed Scottish aristocrats accused of claiming $167,000 in welfare while living aboard a $1.2million yacht have told a court they are broke.

Prosecutors claim Colin Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bed lakeside home, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds.

But as they appeared in orange jumpsuits before a court in their home state of Minnesota, their lawyer said he was representing the couple for free and they could not afford bail.

Prison jumpsuits: Prosecutors say Andrea and Colin Chisholm, who proclaim themselves to be descended from Scottish aristocrats, cheated the states of Minnesota and Florida out of $167,000 while living on a yacht

Colin Chisolm's attorney Thomas Kelly told prosecutors they were 'not going to see that they were living a luxurious life down there', David Chanen of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

Mr Kelly added: 'They are neither trying to avoid police or repaying the money... If they had money, they would settle up.'

The attorney said some aspects of the case were agreed but several allegations were in dispute.

He said the couple were only in the Bahamas because their business failed, had several conversations about their situation with officials and been co-operative with the authorities.

But despite the plea, a judge doubled their bail from $150,000 to $300,000 after prosecutors insisted they had tried to cheat the authorities even while on the run, the Star Tribune reported.

'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm III and his wife 'Lady' Andrea appeared in jumpsuits in a Florida courtroom earlier this month where they agreed to be extradited to Minnesota to face the allegations

The Chisholms allegedly collected food 
stamps, welfare and Medicaid in Florida and Minnesota over a seven-year period while living a 
life of luxury aboard their yacht Andrea Aras.

Prosecutors claim they fled Minnesota with their seven-year-old son and 
their dog as investigators tightened the net around them.

The
 couple, who reportedly had nine purebred Cavalier King Charles 
spaniels, were held in separate Florida jails before being extradited to
 Minnesota two weeks ago.

Colin Chisholm had previously refused to speak to authorities and hired an attorney.

The
 couple claimed to be wealthy 
Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, 
Minnesota, where authorities pledged last month to do everything in their
 power to bring them to justice.

'These were rich folks ripping off the 
system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press 
conference. 'I will make sure they do hard time.'

'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida

The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida

The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars.

Colin
 Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and
 is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings.

The
 couple were allegedly receiving public assistance for their medical care and food
 stamps in Minnesota for years while also collecting welfare 
in Florida.

According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. 

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute.

In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he 
ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds 
championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank

Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean.

More than $1 million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. 

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

None
 of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea 
Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her 
elderly grandmother.

Hennepin
 County Attorney Mike Freeman said previously: 'It is truly outrageous 
when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of 
us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system.

'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.'

Hennepin
 County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all 
welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012.

Prosecutors
 will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the
 Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because they say the Chisholms 
committed a major economic offence.
