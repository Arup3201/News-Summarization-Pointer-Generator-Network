Stephen Fry made the comments about Operation Yewtree while hosting a Labour fund-raising gala

Stephen Fry faced a furious backlash last night after attacking the country’s most high-profile police inquiry into historic sex abuse while  hosting a Labour fundraiser.

The comedian shocked guests at the party last week when he blasted Operation Yewtree which has led to less than half of suspects being convicted.

He urged guests, who included Labour leader Ed Miliband, to remember that ‘people are innocent until proven guilty’ and singled out former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for criticism.

The TV presenter is believed to be angry over the treatment of his friend DJ Paul Gambaccini, 64, who remains on bail after his arrest by police investigating claims of historic sex offences.

But child protection campaigner Peter Saunders said Fry was ‘simply wrong’.

The chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said the landmark police inquiry has demonstrated that no one is above the law.

He also praised Mr Starmer’s successor Alison Saunders for continuing to investigate suspects, regardless of their fame or connections.

He said: ‘Stephen Fry thrives on publicity and occasionally says some quite outrageous and highly inappropriate things. Mr Fry, like many other so-called celebrities, may consider himself to be above the law that applies to the rest of us mere mortals.

‘Fortunately he is wrong, and just because someone is a household name doesn’t mean that the past will not catch up with them.

‘Alison Saunders and other prosecutors deserve a medal to “dare” to prosecute people who are rich and famous.

‘If it is a witch hunt to go after people who rape and abuse our children, whenever it may have happened, then I’m all for it.

‘The consequences of these vile crimes last a life-time for the victims. If we are serious about eradicating abuse then we have to stay with zero tolerance.

‘That’s the least we can do for victims now and it’s the least we can do for our children tomorrow.’

Fry, who presents the popular BBC quiz show QI, shocked guests as he hosted the Labour fundraising event, where tables of nine cost up to £15,000, at the Roundhouse arts venue in North London.

Guests said he quickly diverted from his usual educated banter and went on a ‘rant’ about the Yewtree investigation.

He urged the crowd to remember some of ‘the essential values which the Labour Party stands for’ and cited the Magna Carta, the foundation of British rights.

Fry said ‘fewer than half’ of the people arrested by Yewtree  detectives have been found guilty, and identified Mr Starmer in  the audience.

He then said the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse.

One of the guests told the Mail On Sunday: ‘It was all a bit awkward. There was a smattering of applause, but mostly there was this deadly silence.’

Referring to Mr Miliband, he added: ‘And Ed looked as if he had swallowed a wasp.’

Gambaccini is one of just a  handful of suspects left on bail by the Yewtree inquiry, which began  in late 2012 after veteran TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile. The pop music expert, broadcaster and author is expected to answer bail in mid-September. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Starmer, who is rumoured to be positioning himself for  Parliament via a safe Labour seat, was one of the leading figures in deciding how Operation Yewtree should run.

The multi-million-pound inquiry has claimed a series of notable scalps, such as publicist Max Clifford and more recently Rolf Harris, while winning justice for victims whose lives have been destroyed.

But one suspect committed suicide and others, including Freddie Starr, Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck, were told they faced no further action despite spending months on bail.

Three Yewtree suspects remain on bail, including Gambaccini. The other two men, aged 74 and 73, have not been named publicly.

Former radio DJ Dave Lee Travis faces a retrial later this year after a jury failed to reach verdicts on two counts. He also faces a new charge of sexual assault.

Two others, former DJ Chris Denning and pop star Gary Glitter, face trial accused of sexually assaulting children.

Mr Miliband’s office appeared to rebuke Fry over his outburst. His spokesman said Mr Miliband has ‘made it clear all along that our thoughts should be with the victims’. 

Fry is famously outspoken. Last year he offended Russia by claiming the 2014 Winter Olympics should be moved from Sochi because President Putin ‘is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews’ before the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

In 2010, he offended feminists  and many women by saying  they don’t like sex.  And the year before that he defended the MPs’ expenses scandal saying it was ‘not important’.

Also in attendance at the Labour event last Wednesday were actor Sir Patrick Stewart, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, cross-dressing artist Grayson Perry and comedian Eddie Izzard, who arrived wearing bright red lipstick.

Labour refused to release the full list of attendees – just days after it demanded David Cameron release a list of guests at a similar Conservative Party event.
