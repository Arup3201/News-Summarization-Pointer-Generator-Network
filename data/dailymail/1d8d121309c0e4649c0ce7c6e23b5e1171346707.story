AP McCoy, racing’s Mr Indestructible, claimed his 200th winner at Newbury on Saturday  — and then revealed he will retire by the end of the season. 

The 19-time champion jockey made the surprise announcement after a victory on Mr Mole that sealed the ninth double century in a remarkable career. 

There had already been a hint of his intention to quit at Wetherby in October when the pain of rib and  shoulder injuries meant McCoy, aged 40, was barely able to move as he rode Goodwood Mirage to victory

The iron man’s mask slipped and he was unable to conceal the agony. That wince at Wetherby also signalled the moment when his dream of becoming the first jockey to ride 300 winners in a season was over.

The public announcement of his impending retirement came on Saturday after Mr Mole, trained by Jonjo O’Neill and owned by his boss, Irish millionaire owner JP McManus, had won the Game Spirit Chase.

An emotional McCoy admitted that he had talked to McManus about ending his career — he has ridden more than 4,300 winners — last April but it was that injury blow which had finally bent, if not broken, his iron will.

McCoy, who also won the opening race on Qewy, said: ‘Believe or not I spoke to JP about it in April, that it [retirement] was possible. I’ve got a real thing about going out in a blaze of glory and through the early part of the season thought that I was going to ride 300 winners.

‘Then I got injured at Worcester and went back riding after a few days in a lot of pain. It was not the brightest thing to do. But if I was going to ride 300 winners, I was going to have to keep riding. I thought I could do it and the fact it was taken away from me broke my heart. It is emotional because I am retiring from something I really like doing. That is why it is tough, but it is the right thing.

‘Could I ride for another three or four years? I think I could. But I wanted to retire while I am champion jockey and feel I am still riding at a good level and not making a show of myself.

‘All those things were important to me. It was always going to be tough. If I rode next year there were always going to be good horses coming along that I could ride. I thought if I could ride 20 jockey championships it was a good achievement.’

I didn't expect the announcement but it also came as no surprise. It is an incredible testament to AP McCoy that he has been able to dictate when he is going to retire.

It is great to have done what he has done as a jump jockey, ride and last so long, and still be in charge of his own destiny.

This was a big decision and big decisions are the hard decisions, but AP has never been afraid of making them.

He has been a wonderful ambassador for racing and an incredible jockey and it is both an honour and a privilege to be able to say that I have ridden with him. He was so damn good that he always made you try harder. 

He has set standards and records that are going to be in the history books for a long, long time.

Why was he so good? He was just brilliant. But what makes Messi brilliant, what makes Ronaldo and Federer brilliant? They are all just unbelievably talented sportsmen. 

Although I will remember the races I lost against him more than the ones I won, I have still enjoyed every day of it. It might seem strange to say when someone is so good, but I will really miss riding against him.

With that, McCoy asked to be excused. He was on the verge of tears; crying in public would have been a rare first for a man who has won everything there is to win in jump racing.

The raw emotion also showed just how tough this will have been for a man who lives and breathes his sport. He acknowledged he had no idea what he will do next, although his development as an eloquent and thoughtful speaker will mean offers to work in the media are likely to flood in.

That may be a more attractive route than training — something he has always shied away from — because he would always be under pressure to match his achievement in the saddle if he opted to take such a career route. 

The final decision to call it a day, McCoy admitted, was when he invited his agent, Dave Roberts, to dinner on Monday evening without even his wife, Channelle, knowing what was going to be discussed.

Roberts, making a rare appearance on the racecourse, said he knew that the decision to retire was correct because he felt the his client was ‘at peace with decision’.

He also stressed it will be ‘business as usual’ until the end of the season and McCoy is in action at Leopardstown on Sunday.

But it could be significant that the jockey’s management were stressing his retirement would be by the end of the season as opposed to at the end when they issued a prepared statement.That would presumably allow McCoy to quit before the end of the campaign, with his 20th title secure, possibly after the Grand National at Aintree in April, the race he won in 2010 on Don’t Push It.

McCoy said he felt he could race on for another couple of years but wanted to quit

McCoy admitted it was a moment he had been dreading for some time 

That success catapulted him from the superstar on racing’s stage to a national sporting icon, confirmed when he was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Between now and that final ride, whenever that may be, racing will have to come to terms with losing its biggest attraction and the man many consider to be the sport’s greatest-ever jockey.

The Northern Irishman began riding out for his local trainer Billy Rock at the age of 12, started as an apprentice Flat jockey with Irish trainer Jim Bolger and rode his first winner on Legal Steps at Thurles in March 1992.

But his attention turned to jump racing and, having come to England to work for the late Toby Balding, he partnered his first winner on Chickabiddy at Exeter on September 7, 1994. He finished that season champion conditional jockey and he has been the champion every season since.

He has won every big race in the calendar, including two Cheltenham Gold Cups with Mr Mulligan (1997) and Synchronised (2012), and dominated his sport with a ruthless streak that did not just border on obsessive — it was obsessive.

Pain was overridden, outside distractions shunned. Failure was not considered.

One of the first people to wish him well following the surprise announcement was his long-time ally and supplier of winners, retired trainer Martin Pipe, who said: ‘He was so brave, so much fun and always winning. We will miss him tremendously. He is the best jockey there has ever been.’

Richard Johnson, his greatest rival in the weighing room and now the favourite to be crowned champion next season, said: ‘There will be a few people relieved and will have a few more chances, but it’s certainly a great loss to lose him from the weighing room.’

Just over half an hour after McCoy made his retirement public, he fell at the first flight in the Betfair Hurdle.

It seemed an ironic twist as race-goers digested the news. And there was more irony, because the horse was Goodwood Mirage — the source of that telling Wetherby wince.
