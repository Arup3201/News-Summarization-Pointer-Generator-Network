Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is ready to quit the Emirates Stadium for a move to Manchester United.

The Belgium international has told close pals that he wants to complete a controversial switch to Old Trafford after the World Cup.

United manager Louis van Gaal wants to sign the central-defender this summer in a deal that could be worth in the region of £12million.

Shrewd business? United manager Louis van Gaal wants to sign Vermaelen in a deal worth £12million

It is understood Vermaelen's representatives have already agreed personal terms with United.

The next obstacle United must overcome agreeing a transfer fee with Arsenal, though Sportsmail understands the Old Trafford club will not make a formal offer for the defender until after his involvement in the World Cup is complete.

Nevertheless, United will table a bid and, with Vermaelen on board, are confident of sealing his signature.

Vermaelen has grown increasingly frustrated in north London during recent months as he's been forced to play second fiddle to first-choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.

However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up.

Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position.

Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid.

The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign.
