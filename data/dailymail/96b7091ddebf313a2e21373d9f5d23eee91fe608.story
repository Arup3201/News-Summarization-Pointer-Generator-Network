'Fraudster': Jean-Claude Baumgartner, pictured on the slopes was sentenced to two years and eight months jail

A Dragons’ Den conman who blew 
£230,000 invested by Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis was sentenced today to two years and eight months jail-time.

Jean-Claude Baumgartner, 50, duped 
the Dragons into handing over the cash with false promises of a business that would create a ‘satnav for skiers’.

Mr Baumgartner managed to swindle the money with a business plan that was backed up by fake emails and letters.

Judge Aidan Marron QC, sitting at 
Blackfriars Crown Court, said: ‘The fact remains that you have been 
responsible for persistent dishonesty.

'You may well in fact have 
intended to operate a legitimate business but the means that you chose 
to establish that business were in my judgement thoroughly dishonest.

‘You lied about the ownership of 
crucial equipment which was pivotal to your pitch on TV.

'You created a 
wholly false trail of documents to deceive well intentioned people.

‘You have lied so many times about so many features that in my judgement I am entitled to regard that as an aggravating feature.

‘It is clear to me that from an early
stage you were redirecting monies and indeed appropriating funds for 
your own purposes, you were responsible for a number of different frauds
within that main fraud.’

But Baumgartner blamed the failure of
the business to take off by claiming he had not received the support, 
advice and expertise the Dragons had promised.

Rebecca Trowler, defending, said he 
had already invested over £250,000 in the product which had been 
designed by his business associate Paul Burrowes.

Ms Trowler said: ‘He certainly felt 
that he did not receive the support, expertise and resources that had 
been promised and is regularly promised to those on Dragons Den, to 
those who give up a substantial percentage of their business.

‘The relationship was not as good as 
it could have been, he felt very let down and was not receiving the 
support he needed in the context of having given up a good deal of his 
business. Apparently this is a good deal for some but not Mr 
Baumgartner.’

She said he ‘genuinely believed’ in the 
product and the business and thought it would work out so ‘in 
desperation’ got the extra cash.

She pleaded with the judge for a 
suspended sentence so that her client could continue to launch his 
‘fabulous creation’, the ski satnav.

She said the father of two believed that if freed he could pay the Dragons back within six months.

He admitted he had lied to get the 
loan but ‘within weeks of the pitch’ he got the the sole rights to the 
Satski, which had won a gadget show award, as promised, she told the 
court.

Mr Baumgartner originally denied the 
offences, claiming it was the Dragon’s employees that had siphoned off 
the funds.

But today he admitted one count of fraud after his trial had 
been due to begin.

Judge Marron said: ‘You were prepared
to orchestrate a lot of nasty allegations against perfectly 
respectable, honest people to save your own skin.’

Invention: The Satski product which Jean-Claude Baumgartner went on Dragons' Den to get an investment for

The episode of the hit BBC show was 
filmed in June 2009 but was not aired until March 2010 when the business
had already encountered trouble.

It was then discovered that a company he 
was part of, Piste Activities, had hit the rocks with £200,000 losses 
and over £100,000 debts.

As a result of the revelations, the already suspicious investors looked into the accounts and uncovered the fraud.

Judge Marron added: ‘You could have enjoyed a privileged existence without resorting to dishonesty.’
