Robert Dietz, 59, (pictured) was allegedly using Starbucks' free wi-fi to download the child porn 

A registered sex offender has been arrested again for downloading child pornograpy at Starbucks by the same officer who caught him in 2009.

Robert Dietz, 59, was allegedly using the coffee chain's free wi-fi to download the material at the large store in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Sgt. Vance Stimler, a spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office said Dietz, who was arrested by the same detective for the same offense in 2009.

Dietz, who is on parole, was picked up after a two-month surveillance investigation, reports Oregon Live.

He was arrested on Saturday by Detective Gary Wright - the policeman who caught him before.

It was that conviction five years ago which led to Dietz being sentenced to 40 months in prison.

Stimler said it came to their attention that someone was downloading porn at the store - it is not clear how the police found out.

He speculated that Dietz was probably using the wi-fi in an attempt to conceal his tracks. 

Stimler said Dietz was allegedly also using another Starbucks to download the illegal material.

Oregon Live reports that over the years Dietz has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison following earlier convictions.

Earlier this year Dietz was put on parole for failing to register as a sex offender, Stimler said.

Stimler told the website that following the latest arrest Dietz could face 'substantial time' if found guilty.

Dietz is being held in the Washington County Jail on charges of encouraging child sex abuse and parole violation.
