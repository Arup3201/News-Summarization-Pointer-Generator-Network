A new tax by the European Commission could see 80 per cent of small cider producers affected

Four out of five British cider makers would be put out of business after a new ruling by the European Commission.

The UK government was formally told last week to change its current excise duty, which means cider makers that produce less than 70 hectolitres (12,000 pints) a year do not have to pay duty.

Changes to the 39-year-old exemption is likely to affect 80 per cent of Britain's 480 cider and perry makers, according to the National Association of Cider Makers (NACM).

In a statement, the European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation.

It said: 'EU excise duty rules oblige Member States to levy an excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. 

'There are no provisions which would provide for an exception to the general obligation to levy excise duty in respect of cider and perry made for sale by small domestic producers.'

David Kaspar runs a small apple juice, cider and perry business in Brookthorpe, Gloucestershire, and makes under 170 hectolitres of cider from the 16 acre orchard to sell at markets and a pub.

He told the Observer the tax introduction would be 'another nail in the coffin'. 

'The exemption is fundamental to keeping craft cider-making going. If we had to pay an extra £2,500 it would probably stop us risking making wooden-barrel cider and perry because it's too fragile.

'It would be very sad if the tax came in. Not just for financial reasons. It would hasten the demise of traditional orchards and would be another nail in the coffin of traditional cider-making and would be a loss to the natural habitat.'  

The volume of cider produced annually in the UK is in excess of 6 million hectolitres or 130 million UK gallons, according NACM.

Some have blamed the industrial-scale cider makers who account for the production of 130 million gallons of cider in the UK every year for the intervention by the EC, according to the paper.

The European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation. Currently those that produce less than 70 hectolitres do not have to pay an excise duty

Simon Russell, spokesperson for NACM, told the Financial Times: 'We will make the positive case for the effect of the exemption to be protected whether by retaining the existing legislation or by other means.' 

The Treasury has been given two months to respond to the commission without a 'satisfactory response'  the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

A Treasury spokesperson said: 'The government's support for small cider makers has helped create a diverse and vibrant market, improving consumer choice and creating jobs.

'While we will study the commission's arguments carefully, our support for this industry will continue.'
