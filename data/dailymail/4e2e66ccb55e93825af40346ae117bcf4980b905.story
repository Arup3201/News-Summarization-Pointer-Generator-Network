Just one in 10 mums think politicians have their best interests at heart, a damning report revealed today.

The Asda Mumdex survey of 11,000 of the supermarket’s customers reveals many think MPs do not speak like normal people and almost three-quarters think political party’s policies are too male-centric.

Tory employment minister Esther McVey admitted some politicians use ‘fancy language’ to hide what they really mean from voters.

In Scotland and Wales one in five mums say they feel alienated by politics, rising to 30 per cent in Northern Ireland

More than 80 per cent of those surveyed by Asda say they plan to vote in 2015, but just 2 per cent feel they are represented in the system

Supermarket giant Asda published its latest Mumdex with a year to go until the general election to put pressure on all parties to address the concerns of its customers.

In a major boost for Labour leader Ed Miliband, it shows 65 per cent of mums want action to impose limits on energy prices.

Labour has promised to freeze bills for two years if it wins the election in May 2015.

Almost half of those surveyed back the Lib Dem policy to increase the personal tax allowance, to cut income tax bills, while 42 per cent want improves rights for working families.

Almost three-quarters want the government to focus on solving the cost of living crisis, a key Labour party slogan.

More than half of those questioned said MPs do not understand the financial pressures they face.

Two thirds of mums said they wanted action on energy bills, a key promise made by Labour's Ed Miliband 

73 per cent want more 'honesty' from politicians about what they can realistically achieve

While a third of mums agree that UK politicians look out for the UK’s best interests, only one in 10 agrees ‘they have my best interests at heart’, the report said.

Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said: ‘Mums play such an important role. They are cogs in society but their role and their value just seems to be ignored.’

Speaking at the launch of the report in Parliament, Storm Townend, from Wakefield, said: ‘Politicians have lost touch with people. They use a lot of language and jargon that every day people don’t necessarily understand.

‘It essentially means nothing. I would like them to break the jargon down,’ the mother-of-one said.

In response, Tory minister Miss McVey admitted that many politicians use obscure language to ‘disguise’ what they really mean.

The former TV presenter from Merseyside said: ‘We do have to listen. Sometimes fancy language in a fancy way could be because you’re trying to disguise something or could it be that you don’t quite understand it yourself?

‘I think understanding that basic language really is key and explaining to people.’
