It is a cross between Facebook and Tinder, designed to let student meet new friends and hook up in a safer environment.

Princeton seniors Michael Pinsky and Vaidhy Murti say their new app, called Friendsy, could change the way students make new friends.

Unlike other dating apps, only students are allowed to join.

The app allows users to swipe through profiles, swiping left to discard someone. Rather than simply swiping right to match with someone, users select if they want to friend, date or hook up with another college student. If they also want to, you match.

Through the app, users can chat anonymously, compliment each other, and make friendly and romantic matches when feelings are mutual.

'College students get stuck,' Pinsky said. 

'They want to branch out, but it can be surprisingly difficult to meet new people on campus.'  

The app has already been a huge success, with 25,000 users and 200,000 mutual matches in tests on 40 campuses.

Today Friendsy is launching nationwide, simultaneously establishing networks at more than 1,600 colleges and universities.

Pinsky and Murti said they felt Facebook, Tinder, and Yik Yak don't sufficiently help students branch out of their limited social circles.

Friendsy's main differentiator from Facebook, Tinder, and Yik Yak is its exclusive, private network comprised of only verified college students with .edu email addresses.

'This goes back to the roots of what first made Facebook viral,' the firm says.

University of Michigan sophomore Lindsey Sholes told USA TODAY, 'I definitely feel like Friendsy is a little safer because it is more like a peer group than Tinder.'

To date, Friendsy has raised a total of more than $200,000 from sources including Princeton University and angel investors in New York City to prepare for today's nationwide launch.

'As an interested venture capitalist put it, we're trying to do to Tinder what Facebook did to Myspace,' Murti said. 'Make it exclusive and clean.'
