Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, the Met's most senior female police officer, attended one of the training courses while at Thames Valley Police, which spent £28,000 on them over six years

Police forces have spent almost £470,000 on training courses run by a group dubbed a ‘left-wing Freemasons’.

Senior officers attended classes run by charity Common Purpose.

Its trustees include a co-founder of the group behind the Hacked Off campaign for Press reform.

The Metropolitan Police – which is leading investigations into alleged corruption and phone hacking at newspapers – has spent £60,000 on the leadership courses.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, Chief Inspector of the CPS Michael Fuller and the Met’s top female officer, Cressida Dick, have all attended the £5,000 per week sessions.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘Common Purpose is like a  left-wing version of the Freemasons.

'It’s a networking organisation for the great and good to advance their politically correct view.’

In the last six years, 22 forces have spent £467,547 on courses, Freedom of Information requests by the Sun on Sunday revealed.

The Met has spent £60,000 since 1999. Assistant Commissioner Dick attended while at Thames Valley Police, which spent nearly £28,000. The biggest spender was Police Scotland, at £94,595.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Police must be much clearer about what courses deliver.’

The charity’s website says it offers 
‘inspiration, skills and  connections’. Its 35,000 graduates can stay in
 touch on a password-protected website, and attendees at alumni events 
are not allowed to reveal other guests’ identity.

In 2006, founder Julia Middleton and ex-chairman Sir David Bell founded the Media Standards Trust, which led to Hacked Off.

Common
 Purpose says it is a ‘transparent and successful  educational 
organisation’ with no involvement in the campaign for greater Press 
regulation.
