We all know that Monday feeling.

But a secret guerrilla group of do-gooders are determined to turn 'Blue Monday' into a day to look forward to - by handing out envelopes stuffed with cash to complete strangers.

Hundreds of the blue envelopes have been found across London and the south east accompanied by handwritten notes of cheer.

Blue Monday: Blue envelopes have been found across London and the south east accompanied by handwritten notes of cheer

Random kindness: It seems the Give Monday group was set up simply because 'giving feels good and Mondays are blue'

Each makes reference to a group called GiveMondays - and includes details of a website. 

But rather than finding a clever marketing ploy or PR stunt, visitors to the site looking for more information are likely to leave just as mystified. 

It seems the GiveMondays group was set up simply because 'giving feels good and Mondays are blue' . 

The site reads: 'One fine morning we had an epiphany - giving feels good and Mondays are blue.

'Blessed with this wonderful insight we decided to set up GiveMondays and encourage people to give their week the best possible start by good deeds every Monday.

'So who are we? GiveMondays is an anonymous community of givers. And we’d like you to join us.'

The website and Facebook page is filled with stories of people who have found the envelopes in supermarkets, wedged between library books, or have been personally handed it with a smile before the mystery benefactors disappear into the distance.

David Cole said he found his propped up in a drinks cooler in a Sainsbury's near Bank: 'It 
said.... "The Question you gotta ask yourself is 'Do I feel lucky?'", and
on the reverse it said... "Well Do ya? Punk!".

'I do now! It was so weird. I picked 
up the envelope and looked round the shop. I was all paranoid thinking I
might be on tv or that someone was watching me! Alas it was just a 
random act of kindness.Thank you random stranger!

'I think I will either give the money to Cystic Fibrosis charity, or I might 'Pay it Forward' next Monday for someone else!'

Sarah Fuggle wrote: 'I was handed
a little blue envelope containing £10 as I was being evacuated from 
Victoria Station and had to walk the rest of the journey.

'I was a little overwhelmed, but 
didn't cry... I've given it to The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity because 
they do such great work!'

Mayalen Piñeiro Paredes  London, United Kingdom, said: 'I was walking along Clapham Junction High Street, a bit stressed because I was a bit late for an appointment, and the lady who was walking in front of me turned suddenly, gave me the blue envelope and said 'This is for you, happy Monday!'

'Then she disappeared into the crowdy (sic) street.

'I was shocked and a bit scared of opening it...but when I actually saw the inside and the message, I felt very lucky, specially after having been through a bit of a hard time lately and trying to turn my mind in a "positive mind". That blue envelope really helped. Thanks.

'I will pass it to someone next Monday, it is a fantastic idea to cheer people up this way, and specially on a Monday.'

Karis Layne, from London, added: 'Wow how amazing! Brightened up a bad Monday and made me think of the good things in the world and will keep on trying to pass on good things to others. Just the front of the envelope made me smile :)'

And Marlene Pretorius, wrote: 'Flabbergasted. London is not such a cold place after all. I am totally inspired.'

The end goal of the GiveMondays group is not yet clear.

A message posted on their website reads: 'First things first - we want to build a community of givers.

'We think the best way to do this is by encouraging random acts of kindness and will announce some new ones in the coming months.

'Long term we want to offer our community different ways to give each Monday.

'We’ll continue the random acts but also showcase inspirational fundraisers, unsung heroes and local projects that need your help.'

But their efforts certainly seem to be turning Blue Monday into Happy Monday for those that have stumbled across their generosity.

Lisa Broomhall, who was handed her envelope on the tube between Clapham South and Tooting, said: 'It really brought a smile to my face - and the couple sitting next to me -  and the positive message it sends out means a world more to me than the kindly gifted £10 note.

'I hope I get a chance to gift something the next day this comes around.'
