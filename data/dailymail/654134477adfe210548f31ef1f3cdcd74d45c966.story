A size 30 bakery worker who piled on the pounds by snacking on the stock has lost 10 stone in as many months by giving up eating what she sells.

Stacey Nugent, 24, from Toddington, Bedfordshire, lived off a diet of doughnuts and baguettes every day at her job in Greggs - starting the day with two sausage rolls and a bacon bap.

Making the most of her staff discount, she feasted on the pastry goodies - and put on so much weight that she tipped the scales at 20 stone and struggled to squeeze into her clothes.

Stacey Nugent, 24, piled on the pounds working at Greggs bakery reaching a whopping 20st (left), but she has since given up the greasy snacks and dropped 10st (right) in as many months 

At her heaviest, Stacey was used to snide remarks about her weight from strangers in the street and being unable to find outfits on the high street to fit her frame.

She signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan diet and swapped biscuits, pizza, coke and pastries for healthy soups, sandwiches and grilled chicken salads. 

Stacey said that she would begin to snack on unhealthy treats as soon as she walked through the door at work, and continued to do so throughout the day as it was easier than making a meal.

She said: 'Every morning I would head to work and it would just be normal for me to fill up on whatever the customers were having. 

'It was quicker and easier to grab a sausage roll or a scoff a jam doughnut than make a proper meal.'

Stacey said that as she continued to feast on the baked goods she noticed her clothes becoming tighter to the point where she began to struggle to find outfits to fit. 

'Over the course of a couple of months it really added up and my uniform was getting tighter and tighter,' she said.

BREAKFAST: Two sausage rolls, bacon bap

LUNCH: Baguette, whole pack of biscuits

DINNER: 14-inch pizza with double toppings

SNACKS: 2L coke, half a pack of biscuits

BREAKFAST: Cambridge Weight Plan shake

LUNCH: Healthy soup or sandwich at work.

DINNER: Grilled chicken salad

SNACKS: Nothing

'The only place I could find clothes big enough was in supermarkets - I lived my whole life around food.'

Stacey said that even as she realised she was gaining weight she still found it hard to resist the convenience of the fast food.

Stacey said since reaching a slender size 10 she no longer has any problems finding clothes

'In the evenings I'd bring home snacks because I was so tired from being on my feet all day I couldn't bring myself to cook.'

It wasn't until she became so big that strangers began to point out her size that Stacey finally realised that something had to be done.  

'It really hit home when people were staring and pointing in the street - I couldn't believe I had become such a spectacle,' she said.

'It was so embarrassing I knew I had to do something.'

Fed up of always being the fat friend, Stacey decided to fight the flab by giving up snacking at work completely and taking on a radical diet.

The 24-year-old says she could never imagine going back to her old eating habits 

Instead of eating whatever she served to customers, Stacey started the Cambridge Weight Plan and replaced her giant greasy portions with soups and healthy salads.

In 10 months she'd managed to shed a whopping 10st - half her body weight. 

Stacey is thrilled with her new slender figure and says she has no trouble finding new outfits to wear. 

'Now I can go into a shop and buy any clothes that I want and I love trying out all the tasty healthy alternatives at work, as well as cooking at home.

'And I'm very disciplined at work. My colleagues have been really supportive.' 

Stacey added that she can't ever imagine returning to her old eating habits.  

'Now I can't believe I ever thought that eating pastries for every meal was a good idea!

'It's brilliant to not look like one of the doughnuts I serve to customers!'
