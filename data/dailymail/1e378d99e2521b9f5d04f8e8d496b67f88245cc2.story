For most women a police mug shot is the most humiliating photograph that will ever be taken.

In recent months, photographs of celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon and Lindsay Lohan have been forced to pose for the mandatory 'booking in' picture at the police station.

But these pictures of 10 women arrested
 in the U.S. have shown that some women have managed to maintain their 
looks in their mug shots.

Beauty Queen Lorena Taverna, who was 
Miss El Paso, Texas 2008, must have forgotten to Vaseline her teeth before 
she shot a close-lipped pout to the police camera after being arrested 
for shoplifting a $69 dress at Dillard's department store.

Meanwhile, exotic dancer Toni 
Lee Hopkins does not seem at all intimidated in her mug shot after she 
was hauled in for violating statutes governing sexually oriented businesses in a Houston strip club crackdown.

Sara Jean Isbister managed to look stunning in all eight of her mug shots easily dug up from a web search, including this one in which she just been arrested for failure to appear in court in Brevard County, Florida in 2011 after she was previously arrested for possessing drugs 
equipment.

Isbister's fellow Floridians Jenn Jensen of Osceola was runway ready in her 2011 booking photo and Veronica Rodriguez got her glamor shot in Hillsborough, Florida on drunk driving charges in 2010.

And there must be something in the water because Hillsborough, Florida's Gabrielle Hill also gave amazing face in her 2009 mugshot after an arrest for possession of illegal drugs.

Also under the influence behind the 
wheel, and influencing us all from in front of the camera, is Rachel 
Kathryn Lemler, who was booked in Shasta County, California in 2011 for drunk driving.

Red-head Kathryn Dennis was arrested for 
underage possession of alcohol and disorderly conduct. She was later cleared of any wrong-doing.

Lindsey Evans, arrested for failing to pay a $46 restaurant bill, also maintained her looks for the police photograph.

Award-winning adult film actress Tori 
Black got tearful, but still looked lovely, in her mug taken after a 
domestic battery charge. Cops in Las Vegas brought the porn star in, 
along with her fiancee Lyndell Anderson after Black reportedly punched her Anderson in the
 head in a dispute that began over baby formula and the couple's 5-month-old at the Hard Rock Hotel.

According to TMZ, Black (born Michelle Chapman) was under the influence of alcohol when she returned to their room, where Anderson was waiting with the baby when the fight began.

No stranger to TMZ herself, Lindsay Lohan was arrested in March after she admitted to reckless driving and providing false information to police.

The 26-year-old was given a 90-day rehabilitation stint in lieu of another jail spell after pleading no contest to misdemeanor.

In pleading no contest, Lindsay admitted she had violated her probation in a 2011 shoplifting case.

By May 2, Lohan was slated to begin her court ordered rehab, but footage from that day showed the starlet pulling up to the Southern California facility and then pulling away without ever entering.

On the other end of the celebrity 
spectrum is Reese Witherspoon, who appeared not to be immune from 
similar debacles when she was arrested for 
disorderly conduct earlier this month after a drunken 
confrontation with a police officer.

Video taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ, shows Reese slurring and screaming at a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia following her husband Jim Toth's arrest for driving under the influence.

Witherspoon was arrested on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car.

After repeated requests from the police officer and her husband to stay 
quiet, her antagonistic exchange with the police officer ended in her 
being handcuffed and charged.

In her first television appearance since the incident, Witherspoon visited Good Morning America May 2 and apologized for her and Toth's behavior.

'We thought we were OK to drive but we definitely were not,'  said the 37-year-old mother of three. 'We are just so sorry this happened. We know better than that. It's something that will absolutely never happen again.'
