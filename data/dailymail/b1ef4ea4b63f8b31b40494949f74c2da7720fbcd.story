Humans have been decorating graves with flowers for almost 14,000 years, say archeologists.

The first evidence the tradition of floral tributes has been dug up in Israel where sage, mint and other plants were used in ceremonial burials.

In modern times the tradition is used as a sign of respect or remembrance, but it is believed to have started thousands of years ago to disguise the stench of the rotting corpse.

It was also hoped the scent of the plants would stop animals being attracted to the grave to dig up the body.

The earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with flowers, 13,700 years ago, was discovered in the same location at Mount Carmel last summer. Researchers found sage, mint (pictured) and other plants buried with the skeletons. The latest findings suggest this ritual may have been more complex than first thought

The ancient Romans often laid out the ground of the tomb as a garden so the spirit could enjoy itself as it wandered.

The latest discovery was unearthed at the bottom of 13,700 to 11,700 year-old graves at a scenic prehistoric burial spot known as Raqefet Cave overlooking the Mediterranean coast.

Professor Dani Nadel and his team used radiocarbon dating on the lining of tombs containing 29 skeletons, of children and adults, with four containing large plant impressions identified as the stems of sage, mint and figwort.

Professor Nadel, an archaelogist at Haifa University in Israel, said: 'Flowering plants possess mechanisms that stimulate positive emotional and social responses in humans.

'It's difficult to establish when people started to use flowers in public and ceremonial events because of the scarcity of relevant evidence in the archaeological record.

'We report on uniquely preserved 13,700-11,700-year-old grave linings made of flowers suggesting such use began much earlier than previously thought.'

Part of plants cells called phytoliths from grasses, leaves, reeds and sedges were identified all over the cave and on its terrace.

The discovery was unearthed at the bottom of 13,700 to 11,700 year-old graves (pictured) at a scenic prehistoric burial spot known as Raqefet Cave overlooking the Mediterranean coast. Prof Nadel believes that grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process, embedded with social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural society

The burial pits also had crafted and 
natural stone objects - perhaps as markers or symbols - as well as a 
prevalence of flints and butchered animal bones suggesting celebratory 
feasts. 

Prof Nadel said: 'Some of the plant species attest to spring burials with a strong emphasis on colourful and aromatic flowers.

'Cave floor chiseling to accommodate the desired grave location and depth is also evident at the site.

'Thus,
 grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process, embedded with 
social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural 
society undergoing profound changes at the end ofthe Pleistocene.'

The only earlier evidence of flower burials comes from pollen grains in a neanderthal's grave in Iraq but these could have been left by a rodent with a habit of storing seeds and flower heads.

The largest number of preserved plant impressions was in the double burial of a 12 to 15 year-old adolescent and an individual over 30.

The two were lying on their backs parallel to each other with their elbows juxtaposed, according to the research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The ancient burial pit dating to nearly 14,000 years ago contained impressions from stems and flowers of aromatic plants such as sage (left) and mint (right)

Prof Nadel said: 'The finds from Raqefet Cave indicate 13,700 to 11,700 years ago the Natufians lined graves with a soft mud veneer and then placed a thick cover of fresh flowering plants -thereby providing colour and aromatic fragrance.

'Experimental studies have demonstrated flowers' significant role as external sources of emotional stimuli with measurable positive impacts on human social function.

'Flowers can be used to express sympathy, pride and joy. They also are used to express religious feelings; in some religions flowers are considered the direct route for spiritual communication. 

'These relationships may benefit fitness in both humans and flowers and have been linked to the domestication of certain species of flowering plants more than 5,000 years ago.'

The use of flowers much earlier in social events such as funerals could have served to enhance group identity and solidarity.

Prof Nadel said: 'The development of group-specific burials and related practices likely reduced social tensions and improved group cohesion in a period of fluctuating environmental conditions, increasing population density and growing social conflicts.

'The emergence of cemeteries such as those at Raqefet Cave and Hilazon Tachtit Cave also may represent new and complex social organisations which could have included the establishment or strengthening of special interest groups, inheritance of corporate property, territorial ownerships and aspects of social organisation.'
