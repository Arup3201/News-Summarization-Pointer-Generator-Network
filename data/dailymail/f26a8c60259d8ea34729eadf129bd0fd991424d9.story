The Los Angeles Kings kept rolling toward the playoffs with their sixth straight victory on Saturday, thanks in part to an almost impossibly perfect save by goaltender Jonathan Quick.

The save was one of 24 Quick made during the game against the Winnipeg Jets, but the fact that he did it while flat on his stomach using his leg and quick wits made this one special.

The scorpion kick came with just one minute left to play and was defininetly the most impressive save of the night and fans are already calling it the best of the year.

The shutout for Jets means they are unlikely to make it to the playoffs, while it was a coninuance of a late season surge for the Kings, who will likely open the postseason against Anaheim or San Jose.
