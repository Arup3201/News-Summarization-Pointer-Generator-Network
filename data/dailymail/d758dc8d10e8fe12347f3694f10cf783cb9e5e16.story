Company, atten-SHUN! Labour MPs leapt to attention in the Commons yesterday afternoon when it came to a Standing Order 24 motion on the Murdoch newspapers’ alleged nefarious doings.

Any Sergeant Major would have been proud to call that lot his platoon. One minute they were on their bottoms. The next they were ramrod straight on their pins.

A rare parliamentary procedure, the SO 24. It calls for MPs to indicate their approval for an urgent debate by standing, rather than the usual shouting or voting in a lobby.

The charge: A private detective working for the News of the World is accused of hacking into Milly Dowler's voicemail after she went missing

The Opposition benches were almost full. The Government side was largely empty. A few Tory backbenchers stood, some of them hesitantly because, perhaps, they were unused to the procedure.

Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) was one of those supporting the motion. Rich Zac is one of the few MPs to be unafraid of Mr Murdoch. Until yesterday, at least. But yesterday a lot more joined him. Group bravery has kicked in.

Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, used the word ‘grotesque’ to describe the hacking of the late Milly Dowler’s telephone. ‘If this is true it is simply beneath contempt,’ said Mr Clegg. ‘Grotesque, heart-rending,’ he added.

Harriet Harman managed to put aside her well-known admiration for the red-top press (you know how Harriet does love a page 3 girl) and cried: ‘We must clean up the British press.’ Is she turning into Jonathan Aitken?

This from a woman who happily tolerated the Murdochites back in the Blair and Brown governments when organs such as The Sun and The Times urged readers to vote Labour.

Ben Bradshaw (Lab, Exeter) indicated his approval. Mr Bradshaw was Culture Secretary in the last government. Miss Harman and others wanted a public inquiry. Mr Clegg argued that that could get in the way of any chance of prosecutions.

The Standing Order 24 motion was moved by Chris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda), who long ago had his political prospects bruised by press coverage (you may recall a marvellously fetching photograph of him in his tidy smalls).

Mr Bryant, who is one of the ablest parliamentarians in this Commons, came up with a memorable phrase. He accused News of the World grunts of ‘playing God with a family’s emotions’ in the Milly Dowler case.

Much to consider: Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International - owned by Rupert Murdoch - has been urged to 'consider her position' by Labour leader Ed Miliband

This had an echo, perhaps, of the comment once made by a Press Council chairman that certain newspapers ‘dabbled in people’s souls’.

The Dowler allegations are much more potent than previous phone-hacking complaints, which seemed to have more to do with the injured pride of politicians and celebrities. While the matter remained only about John Prescott, no one was likely to become too fussed. This time, however, there is genuine astonishment and affront.

This time the reported offence is palpably nasty. Mr Bryant read his short speech off a page of tightly-typed script. It focused as much on police ‘lies’ as it did on Grub Street’s misdemeanours.

The Government front bench and, oddly, the Lib Dem benches, remained seated when the standing vote on Mr Bryant’s motion was taken. They were abstaining. The debate will occur today, after Prime Minister’s Questions.

Political bravery being in large part a question of fashion, it would be a surprise to hear anyone today stand up for the Murdoch organisation, or indeed for the printed press.

The Prime Minister piled in yesterday from Afghanistan. Mr Clegg was saying his stuff at the despatch box. Ed Miliband was attacking Murdoch from a filmed venue somewhere in London – maybe an adenoid clinic, for all we know. Suddenly they were all at it. Down with Murdoch. Down with pesky journalists.

Though the anger about Milly Dowler is genuine, there is also a faint whiff of a political elite exacting revenge on a media which has repeatedly shown MPs to be swindlers and hypocrites. What a toxic carry-on.

At this rate we’ll have old Rupe himself summoned to the Commons Chamber and told to prostrate himself like some disgraced Japanese industrialist. Speaker Bercow would love that.

Battle between Parliamentarians and the Press is usually knockabout stuff. But this time there is genuine outrage among MPs at the idea that a murdered girl's phone was hacked
