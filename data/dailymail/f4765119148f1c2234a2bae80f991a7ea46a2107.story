Despite a promising league position and a place in the Champions League a real possibility, Manchester United appear to have had a solid season - but their misfiring strikers continue to be a hot topic.

Louis van Gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of United deciding not to sign Radamel Falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances. 

Club legend Dwight Yorke formed a formidable partnership with Andy Cole during their years at the Red Devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at Old Trafford.  

Dwight Yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror he said: 'I'm sure it's only a matter of time before things click, but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen.

For me and (Andrew) Coley, we were blessed, as we had the likes of Beckham, Giggs and Scholes providing the ammunition. It was dead easy for us, we just had to put the ball in the net. They were magical times and we had many magical moments.

'Hopefully the same thing can happen again for this United side.'

Wayne Rooney is the clubs current top-scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, with the England captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months.

With Robin van Persie recently suffering an injury, Yorke feels that Rooney and Radamel Falcao could be the pairing to set Old Trafford alight again. 

He said: 'United have world class strikers in the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, but they don't seem to have found the ideal combination.

Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at United and was hauled off against Preston in the FA Cup

'Rooney and Van Persie as a pairing hasn't really clicked, so maybe a Rooney-Falcao combo might provide the answer for United long-term.'

The former Trinidad and Tobago international was also keen to pass on some words of wisdom to Van Gaal and the United players with a place at Wembley just one win away. 

'Go out and express yourselves!'
