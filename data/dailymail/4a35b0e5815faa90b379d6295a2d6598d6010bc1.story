'Caged animal': Natalie Harvey, 19, with boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, could have to give birth in jail

A tearaway teenage mother could have to give birth to her second child in jail after behaving like a ‘caged animal’ during a reign of terror.

Natalie Harvey, 19, became a mother aged 16 and brought misery to her hometown of Burnley, Lancashire, with a campaign of abuse and intimidation against shoppers and council staff.

She already had 26 convictions - several for violence - and was issued with an Asbo banning her from her regular haunts in the town, including a shopping centre and a public library.

Now Harvey is 29 weeks pregnant by her serial conman boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, who has already served jail terms for charity scams after getting cash out of elderly victims by claiming he was collecting for a sick little brother.

Last Friday, Harvey was hauled back to court after launched a ‘shocking’ attack on a woman in a busy McDonald’s restaurant.

A judge adjourned her case for reports but warned her she faced giving birth behind bars at HMP Styal, a women’s prison in Cheshire.

She received an interim Asbo in November last year after police said she was ‘out of control’ and regularly causing trouble across Burnley.

She was due to face a full Asbo hearing which would have heard the full extent of her offending.

But four days later she got a supervision order for assaulting a woman called Ann-Marie Gornall and resisting a police officer. She was also arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and a sexual offence.

The latest offence in McDonald’s occurred when Harvey spotted Miss Gornall and told her: ‘You’re going to get stabbed up - why have you got me done? You are going to get me sent down for this.’

When Miss Gornall tried to leave, Harvey grabbed her, pulled her to the floor and kicked her. Burnley Crown Court heard how one horrified diner shouted to Harvey: ‘This is a public place.’

He told police the assault was completely unprovoked, malicious and quite shocking. Staff and customers went to assist Miss Gornall, who did not suffer any visible injuries.

Harvey, who made no comment when questioned by police, admitted witness intimidation.

In mitigation, her barrister Tim Brennand said his client was recently robbed of £2,000 at knifepoint, and added that Harvey was a ‘product of the care system’.

'She behaved almost like a caged animal. Although she didn’t know it, she was crying out for help and attention'

Tim Brennand, defending

She was fostered and placed into care at the age of three, had been moved from institution to institution and became a mother at the age of 16. She had also recently discovered her biological father had been murdered.

‘There had been issues in relation to substance abuse, no stability, no job, no parental figure and no control,’ said Mr Brennand.

‘When I first met her, she had poor eye contact, was rebellious, had clear disregard for her social worker and seemed to resent and resist efforts being made to help and assist her.

‘She behaved almost like a caged animal. Although she didn’t know it, she was crying out for help and attention. She has exasperated just about everyone who has offered her help.

‘The citizens of Burnley are heartily weary of her but she is equally heartily weary of Burnley. She doesn’t want to give birth in Styal. She shows the first glimmerings of maturing.

'You may still go to Styal. You may still have your baby in Styal'

Judge Simon Newell

‘This year, she is offence-free. That is a small landmark, given her record. She is really trying to put her life in some semblance of order.’

Judge Simon Newell gave Harvey bail until June, but told her: ‘You may still go to Styal. You may still have your baby in Styal.’

Police have said locals have not made any complaints about Harvey since she was issued with her Asbo which bans her from using abusive or threatening behaviour, or hand gestures.

Burnley Council is also seeking a closure order on her flat, to stop anyone entering or living there.
