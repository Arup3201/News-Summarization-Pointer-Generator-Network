An adorable baby raccoon in Matheson Hammock , Fla. got its head stuck in a jar on Saturday.

The Raccoon, was tirelessly trying to find some food, managed to wedge his head through the tiny opening of a jar, but couldn't get its furry face back out.

The animal was hopelessly wandering around when a reporter working the field for Local 10 news, Carlos Suarez, found the animal in need. He called 911.

The tired raccoon sat on top of a trash can and almost passed out in resignation before Miami Fire Rescue came to free the animal from it's sticky situation.

Once a firefighter freed the racoons from the jar, it joyfully leaped from the firefighter's hands and scampered off to find some more food hopefully--hopefully not in any tight spaces.

A firefighter from Miami rescue told Mail Online that this was a rare occasion for them and that while they do animal and fire rescue, less people call about animals than they do people but that they do their best to help both. If people spot injured animals in Florida they should call the South Florida Wildlife Center at 954-524-4302.
