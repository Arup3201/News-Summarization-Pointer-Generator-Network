It is part of the national stereotype that Britons love queuing, but new research has shown that the majority of customers will abandon their shopping if the line is too long.

New research by mobile company EE reveals that three quarters of customers will leave without buying anything if they are forced to wait longer than five minutes, costing retailers £1billion a year.

The survey also revealed that nearly a third of customers will only wait a maximum of two minutes, while 59 per cent will wait no longer than four minutes.

Research has found that, despite the national stereotype, British shoppers hate queuing more than five minutes

Now a new system is being brought into Asda stores which will see shop assistant given tablet computers to help take payments when the checkouts are busy.

Staff will also be able to check whether a product is in stock on the devices, meaning less time spent away from the shop floor.

A new heat-mapping programme will also let managers know when the tills will become busy, meaning they can direct more staff there to shorten line.

And free wireless internet will be available for both staff and customers.

An EE spokesman said: 'British consumers are demanding retailers use mobile technology to improve their in-store shopping experience.

Asda staff are being given tablet computers to help customers pay without visiting the tills, and to check stock without having to leave the shop floor

'For example, according to EE research, Britons are increasingly frustrated at the time it takes for sales assistants to check whether a product is in stock.

'It's therefore unsurprising that nearly three-quarters of consumers, 74 per cent, believe in-store sales assistants should use tablets so they can check stock levels if a product is not on the shop floor.

'Shoppers also see the benefit of using mobile devices to cut queues, which are costing retailers £1 billion a year, as 63 per cent want shop assistants to use tablets to take payment for goods when tills get too busy.'
