A high school teacher charged with murdering her ex-husband earlier this month is expected to be released on bail after a judge halved her bond to $250,000 at a hearing on Thursday.

Cara Ryan, 45, is accused of killing John 'J.J.' Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, after an argument on the evening of March 7.

Rush's daughter, Meghan, 21, who testified at the hearing, sobbed as Circuit Judge Michael Andrews announced his decision to halve Ryan's original $500,000 bond.

Authorities allege that Ryan shot Rush after calling him to her home with a sexually suggestive text message, reports The Tampa Bay Times. 

Police said Ryan started dating a detention deputy after separating from Rush earlier this year. 

She eventually admitted to investigators that the deputy had texted her the night of the killing and Rush became angry after seeing the message.  

The couple divorced in 2006 but had been in an on-and-off relationship since.

Rush's family say that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February.

During Thursday's bail hearing, Meghan Rush testified that her stepmom and her father had often fought during their marriage.

Forensic specialists told the judge that they believe Rush was shot at about 10:14 p.m.

Ryan called 911 at 10:17 p.m. and told the dispatcher that Rush had raped her and so she had shot him.

Since then Ryan has changed her story several times and at one point she claimed a stranger had burst into her bedroom before she fired the gun.

She has been charged with second-degree murder.

Though acknowledging that the evidence against Ryan is 'pretty significant,' Judge Andrews said her family ties made her a low flight risk. 

Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had worked in the forensic unit at the St Petersburg Police Department. He retired after being injured following an on-duty car crash in 2005.

Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said.

Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home,  WTSP reported.

'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said.

Ryan, who owns the home where Rush was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades.

Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter.

On a gofundme page set up in her father's memory, their daughter Meghan paid tribute to his service. The page has raised more than $6,000 of a $10,000 goal.

'The unexpected death of John has been an emotional roller coaster for our family,' she wrote.

'We are all proud of John's service and we always greatly appreciate the day to day sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make just like John has.'
