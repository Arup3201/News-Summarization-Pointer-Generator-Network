She was the great unrequited love of legendary U.S. writer F. Scott Fitzgerald - a rich debutante believed to have been the primary muse for The Great Gatsby.

And now the exquite seven bedroom mansion owned by Genevra King - who shared a brief but profound fling with the celebrated author as a teen - has been listed for sale at $16.5 million.

Sitting on an 8-acre belt of greenspace, the home - in Lake Forest, Illinois, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan - is said to have been Fitzergald's first taste of the good life.

Indeed, in many ways it resembles the sprawling Long Island party palace he would later pen as the dome of archetypal character Jay Gatsby, complete with hardwood finishings, sprawling staircases and, most importantly, a long private wharf.

So it should come as no surprise that King is considered to be the basis for the woman of Gatsby's infatuation, Daisy Buchanan.

Home of Gatsby's first great love: This seven bedroom house in Lake Forest, Illinois, was the home of Genevra King, the woman that F.Scott Fitzgerald based Daisy Buchanan on in The Great Gatsby. The home is up for sale for $16.5 million

As fans of The Great Gatsby will attest, F. Scott Fitzgerald made a private wharf one of the main focal points of his story. Could this have been the one that first piked his interest?

Pretty as a picture: Genevra King, a rich debutante, was the great unrequited love of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Much like the story he would wrote about iconic characters Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, their relationship was doomed

King was born in Chicago in 1898 and met Fitzergald when she was in boarding school, according to the Huffington Post.

He was a 19-year-old college student at Princeton.

According to the New York Times, letters between the two - which were only unearthed in the last decade - show they were immediately smitten with each other.

'I am madly in love with him,' King wrote in her diary one month after meeting Fitzgerald.

However by January 1917, the fling was over, with King's father Charles Garfield King - who built the house now up for sale - telling Fitzgerald: 'Poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.'

King would soon be engaged to a wealthy Chicago man named William Mitchell, which enraged Fitzgerald.

The relationship came to represent 'not only his condemnation of the rick but his ambivalence, his fascination with wealth and his sense of inferiority around it,' according to James L. West III, author of "The Perfect Hour," a book about Fitzgerald and King's romance.

And so its easy to deduce that King would have inspired Buchanan, a naive, self-centered, but stunning woman, played well by Carey Mulligan in the latest retelling of the story by Australian director Baz Luhrmann.

'It's easy to see Zelda [Fitzgerald's wife] in many of his female characters, but Daisy Buchanan, in particular, has King's famous melodic voice, and Daisy's husband, Tom, is very much like King's father,' West has said.

King would eventually divorce Mitchell, remarry and settle into the ornate Lake Forest abode her father built - and is now available to buy.

The house was last on the market in 2007-09 for $4.5 million.

The exponential rise in value has less to do with the Gatsby link and more to do with the acquisition of a neighboring farm.

The property is measured at 45 acres.

Ont op of that is the original King estate, which was measured as a 7,424-sqaure-foot home and an 8-acre belt of green space.

It is not known whether Fitzgerald - who would later in life refer to King as 'the love of my youth' - ever visited the property.

In 1954, Chicago businessman Frank Reilly and his wife, Antoinette, bought the Kingdom Come Farm property from its third owners.

It was only around that time that The Great Gatsby was annotated a Great American Novel following the death of Fitzgerald from a heart attack.

The Reilly's knew of the connection to Fitzgerald, but 'they didn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it'.

Now it is likely to be the key selling point for any prospective buyer.
