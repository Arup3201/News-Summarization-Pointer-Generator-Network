Turned? Western security officials believe Snowden has become a Russian informant out of fear

Edward Snowden put British agents’ lives at risk, it was claimed yesterday, as it was alleged he spied for Russia while in the U.S.

Intelligence chiefs believe the whistleblower is passing secrets to Vladimir Putin in return for sanctuary.

Snowden, 30, became one of the world’s most wanted men last June when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the US National Security Agency.

He leaked details of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s GCHQ – to illegally view citizens’ private information.

He claimed internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested.

Snowden also made the highly damaging revelation that the U.S. had hacked Chinese computers and the communications of allies such as Germany and France.

The defence contractor, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in U.S. history, on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning.

NSA executive Rick Ledgett, in charge of assessing the damage, said the stolen files contained ‘the keys to the kingdom’. MI5 director general Andrew Parker called it a ‘gift to terrorists’.

Snowden claims he acted after becoming convinced the US  government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Moscow, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.

Sensitive material: General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in March that many of the documents contained highly sensitive material relating to national security

Exploitation: It is claimed that Russian president Vladimir Putin (left) has 
'sought to exploit Snowden (right) and he will continue to do so until he feels 
that he has reached his max on that'

Much of the stolen information was 
revealed by the Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post. But there 
are mounting suspicions Snowden had been recruited – unwittingly or not –
 by foreign agents.

Intelligence chiefs believe he is now a ‘puppet’ 
passing details of military capabilities, operations and tactics to 
Putin’s henchmen, although he denies taking any classified material to 
Russia.

US General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, told American politicians: ‘The vast majority of documents 
Snowden exfiltrated from our highest levels of security had nothing to 
do with government oversight of domestic activities.’

Senator Saxby 
Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, 
said: ‘Putin has sought to exploit Snowden and he will continue to do so
 until he feels he has reached his max. Without question, they are 
manipulating him.

‘Obviously, they wouldn’t have given him asylum if
 they had not obtained certain information. He has access to some 
information that’s undoubtedly been given to the Russians and some of it
 is definitely something that is likely to cost the lives of Americans 
and the lives of some of our allies.’

NSA HQ: The former analyst fled to Russia after leaking hundreds of thousands of top-secret documents which showed the NSA's all-pervasive spying programme that allowed them to eavesdrop on ordinary citizens

A Western intelligence source 
said: ‘We believe the Russians have got more information from him, which
 is the reason why they are allowing him to stay.’

Richard Bejtlich, a
 former US military intelligence agent, said: ‘The debate is, was he 
working for the Chinese or the Russians and he may not even have known 
he was doing that? It is possible for a person to have met someone who 
is empathetic to their cause, who might give them some ideas, without 
them even knowing that is how they recruit.’

But a British official 
told The Times: ‘We think it’s unlikely that Snowden was recruited 
beforehand, or had been manipulated by a foreign intelligence service.’

British intelligence chiefs say suspected terror cells vanished after Snowden leaked details of the techniques used by GCHQ.

Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story, said the ‘security elite’ was smearing Snowden without evidence.
