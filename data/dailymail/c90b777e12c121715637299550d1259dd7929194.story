A paraglider narrowly avoided being electrocuted after spending four hours tangled in a high-voltage power line.

The unlucky man was trapped 100m above a suburb of Granada, Spain after his parachute got caught in the potentially deadly wires.

Onlookers watched in horror as the stricken glider desperately screamed for help while waiting to be rescued.

And there was further drama when an attempted helicopter rescue had to be aborted after it became too dark for its crew to work safely.

Video footage also shows the moment panicked friends of the man, named as as Pedro, realised what had happened to him.

His fellow glider, who was busy capturing panoramic footage on a video camera can be heard to shout 'Where is Pedro? Where is he? Oh God there he is,' in Spanish.Â

The accident forced engineers to cut power in several parts of Granada yesterday so fire crews could safely rescue the man.

It also saw a 2km stretch of the busy A-395 road leading to the popular Sierra Nevada ski resort temporarily closed.

The drama concluded at 9.30pm when a mountain rescue crew used a cable and a crane to bring him to safety.

El Pais newspaper reports that the man was not injured, but was in shock and suffering exhaustion.
