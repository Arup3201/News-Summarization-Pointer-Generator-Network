Vehicles carrying Western aid  to displaced families in Syria and Iraq are being forced to pay huge bribes to Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

In yet another revenue stream for the terrorists, checkpoints have been set up on key roads where trucks carrying food and medical supplies are stopped and forced to pay to continue their journey.

The bribes are reportedly disguised as vague 'transportation costs' by those making the payments, in order not to raise attention to the fact huge sums of Western money are helping to fund the day-to-day running of ISIS' so-called caliphate in the Middle East.

Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria.

Claims that ISIS is recouping vast sums of money from bribes paid by Western aid convoys came from an aid coordinator who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity.

'The convoys have to be approved by ISIS and you have to pay them: the bribes are disguised and itemized as transportation costs,' he said, adding that the payments are made either by foreign or local non-governmental organizations, or by Turkish or Syrian transportation companies.

The aid coordinator also raised concerns that not enough is being done to ensure the supplies themselves do not fall in the terrorists' hands

He claims quantities of Western food and medicine have been used to help appease families living under ISIS' brutal oppression, with some also sold on the black market in eastern Syria.

Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhindered

A key element in ISIS' propaganda campaign is the phony representation that the terror group can operate as an independent state.

However despite their undoubted wealth, the estimated 35,000 fighters in control of up to four million mainly reluctant citizens are unable to produce anything like the steady flow of food and medical aid it requires to function.

As no nation will openly do business with the terror group, despite an estimated £2billion war chest largely raised from oil production and smuggling, the militants are forced to resort to stealing supplies from Western convoys.

It is claimed that, in order to allow the convoys to enter Syria and Iraq, ISIS insists on approving the staff list of transport companies. It also demands that each convoy has at least one militant assigned to oversee the operation and arrange prices with the group's religious leaders.

'We don't have to wrangle with individual ISIS field commanders once approval is given to get the convoy in, as the militants are highly hierarchical...none of the fighters will dare touch it,' an aid coordinator told the Daily Beast.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. 

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. 

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. 

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.  

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'
