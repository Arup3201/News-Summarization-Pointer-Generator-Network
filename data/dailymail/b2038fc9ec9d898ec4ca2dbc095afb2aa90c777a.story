She might be juggling a demanding career with an even more demanding baby but that hasn't stopped Fearne Cotton from upping the ante with her latest collection for Very.

Her 10th collection for the e-tailer included a chic leather biker, as well as pretty pieces perfect for a hot summer's day.

Highlights included a flattering smock dress festooned with blooms and a glamorous black and yellow sporty shift.

Other pieces that are likely to prove popular include a festival-friendly pair of geometric print trousers and a demure dove grey dress.

The campaign itself was shot at London's Portobello Market; a location made famous by 1999 Julia Roberts rom com, Notting Hill.

Cotton, herself no stranger to the delights of Portobello Market and its army of vintage clothing stalls, has been creating collections for the retailer since mid-2009 and is part of a stable of big name designers and celebrities that also includes her best friend, Holly Willoughby.

Other names to create capsule collections for Very include Jasmine Guinness, Caprice, Peaches Geldof and designers Ann Louise Roswald, Amanda Wakeley and Preen.

While Ms Cotton had little in the way of design experience prior to launching her Very collection, her edgy aesthetic and appreciation for flattering silhouettes has seen her range become one of the e-tailer's best-sellers.

That is likely to be down, in part, to the Radio One DJ's own ultra-cool sense of style which has in no way diminished since she became a mother to baby son Rex last year.

Wardrobe essentials include cropped boxy jackets, delicate vintage-style dresses and slouchy tops - all of which regularly appear in Ms Cotton's collections for Very.
