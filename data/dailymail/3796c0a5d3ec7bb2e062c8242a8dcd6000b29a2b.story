A Chinese man suffered from extreme body odour for four years because his armpit hair had become infected.

The 40-year-old went to his doctor complaining of the stench and having 'dirty' armpit hair, which stained his clothes during summer.

This is because there were 'creamy, yellow' secretions on the hairs, according to the case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

A Chinese man suffered from extreme body odour because his armpit hair had become infected. He went to his doctor complaining of 'dirty', smelly armpits, which had 'creamy, yellow' secretions on the hairs

When doctors looked at the hairs under a microscope, they could see the secretions were only on the hair shaft, rather than penetrating it.

The man was diagnosed with trichomycosis axillaris - a bacterial infection caused by the overgrowth of corynebacterium.

The yellow, creamy secretions consist of tightly
packed bacteria which prefer moist areas - hence why they gather in areas such as the armpit and groin.

On closer inspection, 1-2 mm yellow, red or black nodules can also be found around the hair shaft, making the hair appear beaded or thicker.Â 

The rancid, acidic odour was caused by the bacteria metabolising testosterone - a hormone found in sweat - in sweat into pungent compounds, the researchers said.

The condition tends to affect men more than women, because many women shave or wax their armpit hair.

Obesity, excessive sweating and poor hygiene also increase the risk of developing the condition.

Treatment involved shaving the armpit hair off and an antibiotic cream and aluminum chloride being applied to the area, say the doctors at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing.

Within a few weeks, the infection had cleared up and the condition does not have any long-lasting consequences.
