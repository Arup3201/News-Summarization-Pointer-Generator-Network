Disgruntled: Barry Norman claims to have seen more than 12,000 films - and today's don't match up

He claims to have seen more than 12,000 movies in his lifetime as a film critic.

But yesterday Barry Norman branded films today ‘special effect ideas’ not stories.

The 80-year-old criticised the film industry claiming they made films for people with the attention span of ‘fruit flies’.

Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival today Mr Norman told how great films require ‘great plots’ but that too many today fall into the trap of ‘crash, bang, wallop effects.’

He said summer blockbusters in particular often used expensive effects for action scenes which end up amounting to nothing put great explosions of short lived excitement.

Mr Norman said: ‘Too many films are made for a generation with the attention span of fruit flies.

‘I heard a depressing fact that films today are made for the 15 year-old to 18 year-old audience, who are there for the quick thrill and the fast affects.

‘You see them emerge from the cinema unengaged dragging their arms - I joke - but they aren’t charged up. They have had a short lived burst of excitement.

‘You can’t make a film on an idea you need a great story but sadly a lot of films today are made on special effects and the ‘crash, bang, wallop’ effect.

‘We are at an age where people go to the cinema and they want dialogue and that is a shame.

‘Often with these blockbuster films there is lots of shooting, lots of effects, lots of car chases and explosions and not very much substance.’

Mr Norman, a former Fleet Street journalist, began presenting the BBC programme Film in 1972.

In 1988 he accepted a job offer with BSkyB where he remained for three years.

Discussing his memoir novel about his late wife Diana Narracott at the festival Mr Norman joked about their early years of marriage.

The former gossip columnist met his journalist wife when they were both reporting on Moscow State Circus in 1956 visiting London. The pair were married within the first year of dating.

He said: ‘Now-a-days people meet each other, move in together and sort of get on with it. Back in my day it was all much more formal than that.

‘So when we moved in together after getting married I’m not sure we really liked each other. We definitely weren’t happy for the first year, the first two years for her.

‘We had to get used to living with each other before throwing in the towel... In some ways young people today have the right idea.

The 80-year-old former Fleet Street journalist was speaking at Henley Literary Festival earlier today

‘But I think the key to happy marriage is space. Diana loved her sailing and I loved my cricket. She would go off on boats and I would spend the day at Lords and we would tell each other everything in the evening.

‘Of course we were both writers we had a huge amount in common but having our own things kept it ticking over.’

Mr Norman was invited to speak at the festival following the launch of his book ‘See you in the Morning’ which tells the life story of his late wife who passed away two years ago.
