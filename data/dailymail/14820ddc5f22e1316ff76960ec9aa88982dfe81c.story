They are loved by the likes of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton.

But cut-out swimsuits have been voted the worst holiday fashion trend by men and women across the UK, even pipping the widely mocked ‘socks and sandals’ trend to the top spot.

The quirky one-piece that is built for poolside posing was chosen as a naff summer style by 61 per cent of fashion fans polled in a recent survey.

Fashion faux-pas: Sorry Jourdan Dunn and Alessandra Ambrosio, cut-out swimsuits have been voted the worst summer holiday trend

Respondents were asked to list their most cringe-worthy holiday clothing. At a close second place, 59 per cent of people named socks and sandals as a seasonal fashion disaster. Speedos, Hawaiian shirts and patriotic clothing also made the holiday hit list.

The poll also revealed that the majority of holidaymakers admit to ‘not making an effort’ when it comes to holiday fashion.

A staggering 52 per cent of respondents admitted that they didn’t make any effort at all in the summer holiday style stakes.

When asked why this 
was the case, 46 per cent said it was because they weren’t likely to see anyone 
they knew, whilst 19 per cent said it was in order to ‘feel 
comfortable and relaxed’.

Loathed: The costume, loved by Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton, was voted worse than socks and sandals

A spokesman for sunshine.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'It seems both men and women alike 
aren’t a fan of the cut out swimsuit trend.'

'I think it’s fairly normal to let go a 
bit on holiday, because you want to feel relaxed.

'A holiday shouldn’t be
a fashion parade and, whilst it’s nice to dress up on the occasional 
evening, the most important thing is to wear what you feel good in and 
what keeps you cool on a warm break!

Style stakes: Hawaiian shorts and the famous socks and sandals were also voted as some of the biggest summer holiday fashion crimes
