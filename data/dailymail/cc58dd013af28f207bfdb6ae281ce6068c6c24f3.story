Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week is being forced to leave Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park after its February 2015 shows.

The biannual event, which has been at the 2.4-acre space since leaving Bryant Park four years ago, has been court-ordered to leave in a pre-trial settlement, reports CBS News.  

The plaintiffs in the case - various community groups - argued that Fashion Week and other events held there violated the New York State Public Trust Doctrine, which states that city-owned spaces cannot be privatized. Though the park is managed by and adjacent to Lincoln Center, it is still New York property.

So long, Fashion Week! The biannual event will have to find a new home after its February 2015 shows

'We're going to get flowers and benches and there's going to be a park again,' said Olive Freud, the president of one of the groups who filed the lawsuit. 'We're all very happy here.

'We objected to the whole idea of demolishing a park and of throwing the public out and of making this a place for raising money. Private people aren't supposed to be making money on it.'

According to blog A Walk in the Park, 57 trees and countless plants were destroyed to make way for events in the park, and all will have to be replanted as part of the settlement. 

Descendants of Walter Damrosch, the long-time conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra and for whom the park is named, are also satisfied with the agreement.

'I was horrified to learn about the demise of Damrosch Park,' said Sidney Urquhart, his granddaughter. 'It is ironic that a family of German immigrants, who brought so much to the musical life of this city and this country have been pushed aside by a German manufacturer of flashy cars.'

The well-heeled masses will have to head elsewhere! Though it's been suggested Fashion Week will eventually end up at Culture Shed when it opens in 2018, it's unclear where the 8-day event will be held in the meantime 

It has yet to be determined where Fashion Week - an eight-day spectacle where the who's who of fashion editors and buyers go to see designers' latest creations - will go after its last shows at Lincoln Center in February. 

New York's former mayor Michael Bloomberg has suggested that the event could eventually move to Culture Shed, an under-construction event space that is part of the Hudson Yards development on the far west side of Manhattan. The six-story building, however, isn't slated to be open until 2018. 

In the meantime, designers may have to get creative about where they hold their shows - which more and more of them have been doing lately anyway.

Of the more than 300 shows during the week, less than 100 were held at Lincoln Center in recent years.

Many designers have opted for spaces that allow them greater creative freedom and a slower turnaround (at Lincoln Center and Bryant Park, shows are stacked back-to-back, forcing designers to clean up and move out at an alarming pace) - not to mention a cheaper price-tag. 

Lincoln Center's Fashion Week venues cost between $15,000 and $60,000 to rent, cites Fashionista. Those costs - along with publicity, models, stylists, and a host of other show necessities - make $200.000 'a reasonable amount' to expect to spend for a show.
