Stabbing: Investigators said Jessica Hess, pictured, of Riverview, Florida, stabbed a woman Saturday night

A 19-year-old Florida woman is accused of stabbing a 22-year-old rival five times during a Redneck Yacht Club event, before telling her 'I hope you die.'

Investigators said Jessica Hess, of Riverview, Florida, attacked a woman who she saw riding an ATV with her ex-boyfriend in the muddy Punta Gorda park at around 9 p.m. Saturday.

The victim, Amy Rachel, stepped in to stop the fight, which is when Hess allegedly stabbed her repeatedly with a three-inch pocket knife.

After the attack, witnesses said they heard Hess tell the woman, 'I hope you die.'

Other onlookers didn't realize what had happened until they noticed Rachel bleeding.

She was then brought to the front gate of the park, where EMS responded and eventually she was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital's Trauma Center for treatment. She has now been released.

Hess was taken to a Charlotte County hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

After her release, Hess was arrested and is facing charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

According to NBC News, Hess' former boyfriend said the pair had broken up about a year ago. He said the teen has tried to fight any woman she saw him with since then.

Redneck Yacht Club is a muddy park where thousands of young people come to drive trucks and ATVs and party every year. It's not really a yacht club.

According to police, the event has its own security, but they hire off-duty deputies for traffic control.

However, the off-duty deputies were just arriving to the park when the stabbing happened.

Visitor CJ Townsend told NBC it isn't a matter of security.

'It's normally a fun time. We drink a little bit, but nothing too crazy. It's just irresponsible people,' he said.

According to the network, some 14 people were airlifted from the park from 2009-2012.
