A man has been forced to sell his Subaru Brumby ute by his wife because she's pregnant and there's no room for a baby seat.

But Stuart Watt, 32, managed to pen a hilarious but gloomy ad for the quirky offroader which has clocked 280,000km since it was first registered back in 1992.

The dramatic Gumtree ad hails from the Northern Territory, where Mr Watt is advertising the vehicle under the orders of his wife Zelina Carr.

Watt has listed the 1992 Subaru Brumby for $2,500 - but he says finding a buyer has been problematic because everyone thinks the advertisement is just a 'joke'.

Stuart Hall has posted a dramatic ad on gumtree offering his 1992 Subaru Brumby

The hilarious advert is filled with melodramatic language, but Mr Watt said the message rings true

And that's perhaps no surprise, given the ad is filled with dramatic language.

'Perhaps rather ironically, the cruelness of fatherhood is now set to callously deprive me of another 50-60 years of driving pleasure in this mighty beast,' he writes.

Mr Watt describes how he has owned a string of other vehicles since then- a Hilux, Getz, CRV, Pajero, Pajero Junio - but that only his beloved Brumby has 'faithfully and stoically remained by my side'.

He said his wife Zelina was expecting their second child at the time.

'With only days before childbirth is due,' the ad reads, 'my wife is getting a little frantic about irrelevant things. Namely: 'why haven't you sold the brumby yet??'

He even accuses her heart of 'icing over' and claims she no longer understands the notion of sentimentality.

Mr Watt said he has been approached by people on social media suggesting he 'keep the car and ditch the wife'

After listing the cars extensive usage-which includes 280,000km and a broken speedometer-Stuart wrote 'yes she's old and has some inevitable wear and tear, but is super reliable and clearly super cool.'

Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia the ad has some sparked interest on social media.

'Some people have approached us on Facebook. They suggested I keep the car and ditch the wife. She naturally wasn't too happy about that.'

He said since the ute can't fit a baby seat in it, and since his wife has just given birth to their second child, the Brumby is now obsolete as a family vehicle.

'There hasn't been a whole lot of prospective buyers for the car. Maybe people think it's a joke? It's a bit of a gag but the message rings true. The car needs to be sold.'
