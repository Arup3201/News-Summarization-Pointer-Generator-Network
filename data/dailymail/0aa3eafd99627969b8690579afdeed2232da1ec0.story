The last time anyone heard from 30-year-old Tommy Eastep was on July 7, when he was spending the Independence Day weekend on Lake Eufaula in Oklahoma.

But Tommy never returned home to Blanchard, Oklahoma and his family has been looking for him ever since.

Late last month, a break in the case came with the discovery of Tommy's silver 4X4 Chevy pick-up truck north of Holdenville, OKlahoma.

Where is he? Tommy Eastep was last seen spending the Fourth of July weekend at Lake Eufaula, Oklahoma, but he never returned home to Blanchard

Tracking Tommy: Late last month, Tommy's car was found in a rural area north of Holdenville, Oklahoma after he went missing on July 7 from Eufaula Lake

Tommy's debit card and driver's license were inside the locked truck, as well as $70 on the console.

Yesterday, his family drove out to Hughes County to search for any sign of Tommy around his truck.

They drove through the wooded areas on four-wheelers, and cadaver dogs were brought in - but there was still no sign of their son.

Tommy's brother Clint Eastep came up from Texas yesterday to aid in the search.

'We're hoping that maybe he's alive somewhere here in the area,' Clint told News 9 Oklahoma. 'We don't really know.'

'We've just been searching for clothing, a cell phone because he does have his cell phone on him,' he said.

Abandoned: Tommy's truck was discovered late last month in a rural area north of Holdenville, Oklahoma. The truck was locked and had Tommy's debit card, driver's license and $70 dollars inside

Friends joined the search as well as local strangers. Hughes County Sheriff Kenny Snyder was there saying: 'We don't know why he was even this area really.'

The family plans to continue searching the area for any possible clues.

'We all want closure either way,' Clint said.

The family will be looking for Tommy against next Saturday, and invite anyone willing to help to join them. Information on future search parties can be obtained on Tommy's missing person page on Facebook.
