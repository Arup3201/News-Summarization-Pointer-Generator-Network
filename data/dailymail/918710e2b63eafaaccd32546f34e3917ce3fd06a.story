Within minutes of Barack Obama sending a tweet of thanks last night to his followers for their support in securing four more years in the White House it had become the most popular of all time.

President Obama's 'Four more years' tweet, which also features a picture of him embracing the First Lady, quickly racked up more than 350,000 retweets and 100,000 votes as favorite tweets and they're still counting.

It has easily beaten the previous record for most popular tweet, which was ‘RIP Avalanna. i love you’ by Justin Bieber in September with 223,376 retweets.

The previous most popular tweet was this message from @justinbieber

The president has also broke two Facebook records: a post made on 7 November 2012 on Obama's official Facebook page received the Most likes on a Facebook item ever, doubling in less than 24 hours the previous records of 1,662,336 and surpassing by four times the record for Most likes on a Facebook item in 24 hours, which stood at 588,243.

Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief Craig Glenday said: 'Obama did more than just beat Romney; he also ousted Justin Bieber from the Twitter top spot and broke the most significant social media records to date.

'Browsing through the comments on Twitter and Facebook, it's clear that it's not just Americans who are overjoyed at Obama's victory last night – the world has tweeted and posted its support for the President's second term.'

The final figures that will enter the record books will be confirmed by Guinness World Records after the 24-hour period is finalised.

About 32 million tweets referencing the U.S. presidential election were sent on election day, with more than 23 million sent after the first polls closed.

Activity peaked at 8:19 p.m. PT when the major TV networks declared Obama the president, generating 327,452 tweets per minute, Twitter said.

That surpassed the 85,273 tweets per minute that accompanied the announcement that Iowa's electoral votes had gone to Obama just seven minutes earlier.

At around 11.15pm ET, Obama’s campaign team tweeted, 'This happened because of you. Thank you.'

Within
minutes President Obama sent another victory tweet: 'We’re all in this 
together. That’s how we campaigned, and that’s who we are. Thank you. 
-bo'.

The inclusion of
-bo indicated a personal tweet from Obama himself and this message too 
quickly garnered 167,939 retweets within 30 minutes.

The picture of the 
President hugging his wife was also posted on Facebook, where it has 
already amassed more than a million likes and been shared more than 
150,000 times.

Not long after the TV networks announced his victory, President Obama tweeted this message

Within minutes the President had sent another, more personal, message to his followers

This picture of the President and First Lady quickly attracted more than one million likes on Facebook

Twitter has created several special pages for the election, including this, which gives a snapshot of how the candidates are doing in terms of tweets

This election had already been dubbed the first 
'twitter election', and the social networking firm
had already seen a record breaking numbers of tweets sent throughout the 
campaign.

'The volume of conversation has 
exploded over the last several years,' said Adam Sharp of Twitter, who is 
the firm's Head of Government, News and Social Innovation.

'There are more tweets every two days than every tweet sent before the 2008 election.'

Sharp said even he had been surprised by the number of tweets surrounding the election.

Twitter is home to hundreds involved in the election.

Tweets can be tracked on a special interactive map

Here are its accounts picks to follow:

@BarackObama @MittRomney@JoeBiden  @PaulRyanVP@MichelleObama@AnnDRomney@Obama2012@Gov 

'It has been very impressive to see how engaged voters are.

'In
the presidential debates, for example, more than 10 million tweets were sent, 
with the biggest moment seeing 160k tweets per minute - double what we 
saw at the London Olympics when Usain Bolt was running.'

Twitter works closely with both candidate's teams.

'We
work with both campaigns, and with each major news organization, and 
the team all come from Capitol Hill or journalism backgrounds.

'Our goal is to help them be successful - their voters are our users.'

Sharp is confident the service will stand up during the election.

'We've been fortunate with a lot of big events this year- the Olympics, conventions and debates.

'Our
infrastructure is sound we believe - it's more about making sure we are
ready to give news organizations details on the conversation, and what 
people are talking about.

Twitter has played an instrumental part in the election.

Each of the candidates
has tweeted throughout, and Barack Obama went as far as setting up a 
special office in the heart of Silicon Valley to mastermind his online 
assault.

Earlier this year 
his campaign team opened the first Technology Field Office ever to be 
used in a political campaign in a warehouse building in San Francisco.

Around
200 Silicon Valley CEOs, engineers and entrepreneurs attended the sold 
out launch event, and many have been working to spread Obama's message 
through technology ever since.

The firm is urging people to use the #election2012 hashtag for political tweets so it can easily collate them

On election day 2008, twitter saw a total of 1.8 million Tweets.

Compare
this to the 10 million Tweets during the first 90 minute debate earlier
this year, and the incredible growth of the service becomes apparent.

In
fact, the number of Tweets sent every 48 hours in 2012 is the same as 
the total number that had ever been sent on Twitter back in 2008.

'We
learned from 2008 that using the talents and skills of our supporters 
was a key to building the most effective organization,” campaign Deputy 
Press Secretary Katie Hogan said in a statement when it launched.

'Now
we’re taking the next step by providing tools and space for supporters 
in the technology community to help the campaign extend our current 
tools like BarackObama.com and our mobile applications.'

While 
relatively few voters are on Twitter - 13 per cent of American adults 
according to a study by the Pew Research Centre - it's become an 
essential tool for campaigns.

'The
subset of people on Twitter may be relatively small, but it's a 
politically engaged audience whose influence extends both online and 
off,' said Heather LaMarre, a University of Minnesota communications 
professor.

'It's not the direct message that has the biggest influence on people - it's the indirect message.'

Obama's 2012 State of the Union address drew 800,000 tweets, Twitter said.

And
tweets mentioning Rick Santorum jumped from 10-20 per minute to over 
2,500 tweets per minute when news broke that he was suspending his bid 
for the Republican presidential nomination.
