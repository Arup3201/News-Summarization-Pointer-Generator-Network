The Spanish sports papers try to make sense of the basket-case Copa del Rey match between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in their Thursday morning editions.

'They went crazy again' reads the headline on the front of Marca, which features a close-up of the boot Arda Turan hurled at the linesman during the second half.

The referee decided a yellow card was sufficient punishment for Turan, despite the impassioned protests of Barcelona coach Luis Enrique.

It takes about 10 lines on Marca's front page to fully summarise all that happened but the upshot is that Barca's 3-2 win on the night takes them into the semi-finals 4-2 on aggregate.

Meanwhile, Atletico defender Cristian Ansaldi, who was on his way to support his team-mates at the Vicente Calderon, was detained after catching a policeman's hand in his car door.

Ansaldi was trying to drive closer to the stadium but police had already sealed off the access road. As he tried to move barriers blocking his path, he caught the policeman's hand in the door.

Detained during the match at the Arganzuela station, he wasn't released until 12.55am.

AS call it a 'crazy game' and feature a photo of Fernando Torres trying to scrap with Neymar during one of the many flashpoints.

They pinpoint the 42nd minute as the moment things started to unravel for Atletico following Neymar's goal to make it 3-2.

Gabi was sent off in the tunnel at half-time following another confrontation and Mario Suarez also saw red late on to compound Atleti's ill-disciplined performance.

AS also report that Cristiano Ronaldo will be available to play for Real Madrid in the derby with Atletico on February 7 after being handed just a two-match suspension for kicking out at Edimar in their 2-1 win over Cordoba at the weekend. The Portuguese will miss the matches against Real Sociedad and Sevilla instead.

Mundo Deportivo take the Barcelona perspective on things, featuring a picture of Neymar jumping into the air to celebrate one of his goala and the headline 'leap into the semi-finals.'

Interestingly, despite Barca's win, they say that the referee killed the game with his decisions to send off the Atletico players.

Unsurprisingly, they take a different approach to Ronaldo's suspension, saying that the Spanish League's competition commission has shown leniency.

A play on words for Sport, whose headline reads 'La Copa del Ney' in reflection of Neymar's two decisive goals.

The paper hails the 'Trident' between the Brazilian, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, which caused Atletico endless problems during the second leg.

In Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport have been speaking with agent Mino Raiola, who says Juventus will regret it if they decide to sell Paul Pogba.

'Paul is a Van Gogh, the price will be decided by whoever buys him,' he says.

Raiola reveals that his biggest mistake was selling Mario Balotelli to Milan in January 2013: 'With Manchester City he was playing football that mattered.'

Corriere dello Sport report that Mattia Destro's move from Roma to Milan will go through on Thursday. Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani made a personal mission to Destro's house in Rome to convince him to sign a loan deal.

The paper also suggest that Roma are interested in signing Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano and Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka.

Tuttosport reflect on Juve's latest win, 1-0 at Parma to reach the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday night.

'Matador' Alvaro Morata scored the winning goal to send Juve through and they will face either Roma or Fiorentina in the last four.

Their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, however was infuriated at the performance, saying 'We made too many mistakes.'

In Portugal, the sports pages focus extensively on national hero Luis Figo's decision to stand against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

'Figo versus Blatter' reads the headline on A Bola as they swing behind the Portuguese candidate.
