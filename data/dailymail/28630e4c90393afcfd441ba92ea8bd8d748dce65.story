An actor hired to portray popular superhero 'Captain America' was arrested this week for allegedly sending photos of his penis to an underage girl.

29 year-old James Alton, from Maitland, Florida, was arrested on Wednesday before being able to meet in person with the 16 year-old. In text-message conversations with the teen, Alton made plans for the two of them to meet up at a local mall on Friday. He also allegedly talked about 'getting into her' during their conversations.

Alton was busted after the teen's father was tipped off about the possibility that the two would meet up. The father confronted his daughter about the relationship, and she then confirmed to him that the two had been talking, and that the tone of their interactions became sexual. The father told police that he had found the pictures Alton allegedly sent on her phone.

Police arrested Alton, charging him with transmitting harmful material to a minor via electronic device, a felony.

Alton came into contact with the 16 year-old after she posed with him for a picture at the theme park three weeks ago. She then posted the picture online, where Alton saw it and left a comment.

Their online friendship began from there, with the two exchanging phone numbers and then texting each other frequently. However, the correspondence soon turned sexual, with Alton talking to her about masturbation and trading photographs with her. According to Maitland police, 8-10 pictures were exchanged between the two.

Nearly two weeks before his arrest, the teen informed Alton that she was 16 year-old girl. One week later, he sent her a picture of his penis.

In the arrest affidavit, Alton told police that he 'thought it was a joke,' and that he thought it was a 'merely online flirtatious relationship.'

Alton's roommate told WTEV that entire incident is a big misunderstanding. 'It doesn't sound like him at all.  He is a pretty good guy,' said the roommate, Adam Ring.

Alton was later released after posting bond. He has been suspended by Universal Studios.
