Scotland Yard’s press chief resigned yesterday over his links to a News of the World executive embroiled in the phone hacking scandal.

Dick Fedorcio walked out after learning he is accused of gross misconduct for awarding a £1,000-a-day PR deal to Neil Wallis – a former deputy editor at the tabloid who was known by the nickname ‘Wolfman’.

Mr Fedorcio was sent on extended leave last August after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an inquiry.

Resigned: Dick Fedorcio left his job today after the IPCC decided he would face disciplinary proceedings

The move came after it emerged he 
awarded Mr Wallis’s firm Chamy Media a £24,000 contract for advice 
between October 2009 and September 2010.

It is alleged he failed to follow the correct procedures to award the contract. Mr Wallis was arrested on suspicion of hacking last July and remains on bail.

The decision to leave the Met means Mr Fedorcio, who was head of public affairs for 14 years, will not face any further action.

The Met has faced claims it failed to 
investigate phone hacking at the paper because of the close ties between
New of the World bosses and senior Met officers.

The IPCC’s report, which it sent to the Met on January 10, will be made public shortly.

IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass said: 
‘Our investigation found that Mr Fedorcio has a case to answer in 
relation to his procurement of the contract for Chamy Media.

‘Last week the Metropolitan Police 
Service proposed to initiate proceedings for gross misconduct and I 
agreed with that proposal.

‘In light of Mr Fedorcio’s resignation
today, those proceedings cannot now take place and I propose to publish
our investigation report detailing our findings in the next few days.’

Controversy: Neil Wallis was hired by Dick Fedorcio to provide PR advice to the Met

Earlier this month the Leveson Inquiry
into press standards heard that Mr Fedorcio invited people from leading
PR firms Bell Pottinger and Hanover to submit rival bids for the 
contract that was awarded to Mr Wallis.

Chairman Lord Justice Leveson 
suggested that the Met head of public affairs chose these companies 
because he knew they would be more expensive than the former News of the
World executive, adding: 'The point is, this is set up to get a 
result.'

Mr Fedorcio, who was head of public 
affairs at the Yard for 14 years, denied this, but confirmed that he 
initially wanted to award the contract to Mr Wallis without any 
competition.

Mr Wallis offered his services as a PR consultant to the Met over lunch with Mr Fedorcio in August 2009, the inquiry heard.

The Scotland Yard communications 
chief, whose deputy was on long-term sick leave at the time, discussed 
the possibility of hiring the ex-tabloid executive with then-assistant 
commissioner John Yates.

Mr Yates said Mr Wallis gave him 
'categorical assurances' that there was nothing about the News of the 
World phone-hacking case that could emerge later to embarrass the 
Metropolitan Police if he was given the job.

Mr Fedorcio said he only became aware 
that Mr Wallis was of interest to Scotland Yard over phone-hacking on 
the day of his arrest on July 14 last year.

Mr Yates has told the Leveson Inquiry 
he was 'good friends' with Mr Wallis, and attended football matches and 
dined out with him.

He also told the inquiry he had helped
to arrange the loan of a retired police horse to former Sun editor 
Rebekah Brooks, which she kept at her stables in Oxfordshire.

Scotland Yard said it would not comment on any aspect of Mr Fedorcio's pay, including any pension package.

It stated: 'Dick Fedorcio, our 
director of public affairs for the past 14 years, has taken the decision
to leave on March 31, 2012. During that period he has made a very 
significant contribution to the work of the MPS.'
