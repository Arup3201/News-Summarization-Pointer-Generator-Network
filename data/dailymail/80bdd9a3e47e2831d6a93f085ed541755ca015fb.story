A sneak peek look through the lens of Google Glass has revealed the device's potentially endless abilities triggered with, at the very most, a single touch to its side as demonstrated in a newly released video.

With a tap to its temple, hands-free emails, photos, videos, maps and translators - just to name a few - are capable of being accessed, created and sent often without users even noticing it's all there.

'It's about technology that's there when 
you want it but out of the way when you don't,' Google Developer advocate Timothy Jordan said at last month's South by Southwest conference in 
Texas.

Activation: Google developer advocate Timothy Jordan demonstrates how to activate his device with a single tap to its temple, or a swipe downwards to put the screen away

'It feels like technology is getting in the way more than it needs to,' he says. 'And, that's what we are addressing with project glass. It's so that you can still have access to the technology that you love but it doesn't take you out of the moment.'

As seen in a flashy video compilation captured by Google testers, a sculptor uploads an image of a tiger in his screen while his hands stay busy chipping away at a block of ice.

In several other shots travelers upload GPS maps on which way to turn next, or activate the camera so others at their home computer or wearing their own Glass can watch what they see next.

'It's so that you can still have access 
to the technology that you love but it doesn't take you out of the 
moment,' he explains of its use before activating his.

Directions: Keeping both hands on the wheel a driver is able to activate Google Maps and provide visible directions in the corner of their eye on where to turn next

Photos: A woman shows how she was able to snap a photo of this little girl hands free as she stood inside a giant bubble, the result seen in the top right corner

Guidance: A sculptor chips away at a block of ice while keeping an uploaded photo of a tiger, used as a guide for his art, in his screen

With a tap to the temple, the menu appears. With a vertical slide down, it's dismissed.

'Kind of like the back button on your Android phone,' Jordan explained to his audience.

'And it can also hear me,' he says. 'OK Glass, Google, How do you say thank you in Japanese?'

The translation appears in his screen in both English and Japanese, along with personal audio of how to pronounce it, despite there being no ear bud required.

He notes that lack of an ear piece’s importance – despite missing to describe where the audio exactly comes from – explaining that it keeps him still fully engaged with the outside world and those around him.

As for what he sees, he says: 'All I have to do is look up quickly and there's the screen.’

'As I'm wearing glass I still want to be 
able to connect with you and make eye contact, I also don't want 
anything in the way of what I'm doing. But we want Glass in our field of
vision,' he says.

With that being said, look up and there it is in the right-hand corner.

In addition to translation, Jordan explained his ability to open and send emails by speaking - sending both an audio and transcribed copy to his recipient - as well as emoticons simply by saying, for example, 'smiley face.'

Users are also able to access news reports online and either flip through them or have Google Glass read it for them.

All functions are entirely controlled by voice, head gestures, tapping and swiping to the glasses' frame - that can be interchanged as well as its lenses added or removed, including to prescription lenses.

Jordan's presentation last month was also specifically a sneak peek into the Google Mirror API, specific to outside developers and entrepreneurs who may be interested in developing their own programs that can be used by Google Glass in the future.

The gadget is expected out later this year.
