Energy firms have been cleared of rigging gas prices after a year-long investigation.

Electricity and gas watchdog Ofgem and City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said customers had not been ripped off by big firms.

It means there is no respite for families facing price rises of up to 10 per cent this winter.

Ruling: Energy and City watchdogs found that the wholesale market price for gas was not fixed by energy firms

A probe was launched into claims wholesale gas prices were fixed by power firms in September last year.

It came after a whistleblower claimed the gas market had been ‘regularly’ manipulated by some big power companies - prompting concern that this could affect energy prices for households.

The investigation focused on allegations that gas was sold at a lower-than-market price at around 4.30pm on September 28 last year, to manipulate the benchmark price in Britain used by the industry to influence a range of contracts.

But Ofgem today said the unnamed sellers of the six lowball trades that day have given ‘credible’ explanations to ‘demonstrate that their trading activity was not improper.’ ‘No evidence was found which disputes the explanations provided,’ it said.

Price hikes: Despite gas and electricity wholesale and operating costs remaining almost unchanged since autumn 2012, the Big Six companies have pushed through price hikes of up to 10%

Ofgem added: ‘It has been concluded that no evidence of the alleged market manipulation could be found and therefore that the interests of consumers have not been harmed.

‘Ofgem and the FCA always take seriously any allegation of market abuse in energy or financial markets and will consider carefully any evidence that is brought to our attention.’

The watchdog said its probe was detailed, complex and time-consuming and included information analysis and face-to-face meetings.

Energy secretary Ed Davey said Ofgem and the FCA conducted a ‘rigorous review’.

He added: ‘Market abuse is a very serious concern and I'm determined that where it exists, the full force of the law is brought to bear.

‘That's why we're introducing annual competition reviews to make sure the energy market is operating properly, and we're proposing to introduce criminal sanctions for manipulation of the energy markets.’

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

Last month it emerged that profits made by energy firms on household bills have more than doubled in a year while the wholesale price they paid for gas and electricity remained almost unchanged.

It fuelled suggestions that companies were ramping up prices to boost profits.

Increases in what energy companies pay for gas and electricity added just £10 to household bills, but profit margins added £50 in a year.

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

The firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices, bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government.

But official figures released by Ofgem showed company profits had doubled in a year.
