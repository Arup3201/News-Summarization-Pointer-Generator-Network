Holland's Dewi Claire Schreefel secured her first win on the Ladies European Tour with a commanding victory in the Helsingborg Open in Sweden.

Schreefel led from start to finish and saved her best round of the week until last, a closing 66 giving her a 17-under-par total of 271 and seven-shot win over defending champion Rebecca Artis.

'It's a good way to win,' Schreefel said. 'Rebecca had a good chase on and I was glad to be playing well to keep up with her and I can't find a better way to win than this.

Maiden: Schreefel's triumph is her first tournament victory on the Ladies European Tour

'I've been a pro for five years and every year has got better but I felt like this year it was going to come. All the elements came together.'

England's Laura Davies finished a shot behind Artis in third after a closing 66 which featured eagles on the third and sixth.

'A 67 for a top five was what we were looking at, so a 66 for a top three is obviously a bonus,' said the 50-year-old. 'I was just short of the third in two. I had 40 yards and hit a little pitch, it checked up and it ran right up in the middle, so that was nice.

'On number six, I just pulled a five-iron into the greenside bunker but it was an easy bunker shot, flopped it out and it just went in like a putt again.'
