Idolised by millions, Harry Styles and Justin Bieber have serious selling power with teenagers attempting to emulate their clothes and lifestyle.

But now, the two heartthrobs are having a hair-raising effect on sales of something usually reserved for the women of the world.

According to the latest survey, thanks to the tall quiffs and voluminous locks of the singers, more men are opting for hair extensions.

Hair-raising stats: Five times more men are seeking hair extensions to emulate the likes of Harry Styles

With men looking after themselves 
better than ever before, fake tan and hair removal are now commonplace 
in the male grooming regime, and it seems men are now even taking their 
locks seriously by embracing the benefits of extensions.

Usually used by women looking to lengthen their locks, one hair company, Great Lengths, has seen a huge surge in popularity of extensions amongst men.

The brand, who count Aerosmith's Steve Tyler as one of their clients, say more and more men are seeing the benefit of adding extra length, volume and colour with hair enhancement.

Belle Toujours, a hair salon in Cardiff, has had five times more male extensions clients through the door this year, which director Simon Daniel puts down to the long hair trend pioneered by One Direction, Justin Bieber and reality shows like Made in Chelsea.

Speaking about the new trend, which costs between £60-£80 and takes 45 minutes, he said: 'Before this year, we never had any requests for male extensions. Now we have a number of regular clients who come to us for Great Lengths to mirror the look of their favourite celebrity.

'As well as customers, male staff in the salon are also starting to get extensions after seeing how good they look and how versatile long hair can be for styling.

'We get a lot of male customers suffering with natural hair recession and extensions can help to cover this up and build confidence.'

Aleksandra Zdravkova from MichaelJohn in Mayfair has been working with hair extensions for 17 years and has seen a similar increase of late with 20 per cent of her hair extension clients being male.

'Men are a lot more concerned with the way they look nowadays compared to 15 years ago and male hair extensions have definitely become more acceptable,' he said.

'My male clients want to look great with thicker hair that looks and feels completely natural.'
