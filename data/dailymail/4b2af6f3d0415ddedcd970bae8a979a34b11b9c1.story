Phil Tufnell has admitted he is not embarrassed to have had cosmetic surgery to halt the signs of ageing on his hairline.

The former cricketer, 47, said having a hair transplant to rejuvenate his thinning locks was not a 'big deal' and he was happy to harness new technology to boost his barnet. 

He said: 'Years ago there was nothing we could do about these things. If you lost your hair you couldn't get it back but it's ­different now,' he told The Mirror.

Happy: Phil Tufnell is pleased with the results of his hair transplant

Reversing signs of ageing: The area is yet to fully heal but should give the former cricketer thicker locks where he was receding

Why not? The star thinks men should make the most of modern technology to boost their barnets

He added: 'This is just hopefully going to be natural, give me a bit thicker hair where I was receding, so why not? I was ­starting to recede.'

The former Strictly Come Dancing star and I'm A Celebrity champion said he undertook the procedure at DHI Global in London with the full support of his wife, Dawn.

He said he doesn't care if he gets mocked for it by his sportsmen peers and has been proud to show off the results via his Twitter account.

'Revolutionary' technique: He had the treatment at DHI Global whose surgeons can remove up to 6000 individual hairs from one part of the head or body and then replant them

He has also participated in a webinar for his cosmetic surgeons to answer questions from other men who are thinking of following his lead.

He explained: 'I think loads of guys are going to 
start doing it a bit more now, like with all sorts of stuff. With teeth 
whitening. If your teeth are wonky you can do something about it. Remember that 20 years ago you couldn't do that. You had to live with what you had.'

The former England spinner admitted cricket has become a lot more 'metrosexual' since his days at the crease, when all he needed was a toothbrush 'and a bit of underarm' in his wash bag when touring.

'Never say never': He added that he hasn't ruled out Botox

He added that he would 'never say never' to further cosmetic treatments such as Botox but wouldn't go as far as Australian Shane Warne in his pursuit of beauty.

He said: 'I'm not going to go that far. I haven't had a fake tan since I finished Strictly in 2009. Shane looked so different but I don't really see it as something to rib ­someone about.'

Tufnell shared a selfie of his hair transplant with his Twitter followers last week stating: 'Day 1. Job done. Piece of cake! #TuffersBarnet.'

Proud: Phil Tufnell shows off the results of his hair restoration treatment

He later even credited his new do as being a lucky charm for the England cricket team who recently suffered a humiliating 5-0 defeat against Australia in The Ashes.

On Friday, the Alastair Cook led team scored a victory against the Australians in a one day international. The victory prompted Tufnell to tweet: 'The day after my new barnet England start winning! Coincidence?? I don't think so. Good work @DHIGLOBAL'

DHI Global are the international company he turned to for his treatment.

On their website they promise natural results using the latest 'revolutionary techniques that eliminates the use of scalpels.' They add that 'best of all the procedure is pain free'.

Expensive fix: Tufnell visited the London hair implantation branch. They recommend people have four sessions for the best results at a cost of £20,000

Tufnell was pictured outside their London clinic last week having a cigarette between treatments whilst wearing a plastic cover over his head.

Konstantinos Giotis, founder DHI Medical Group, said they recommend four sessions for the best results at a cost of £20,000.

He added that men and women interested in the treatment can start with just one session of £3,000 if they prefer.

The clinic Tufnell visited: The group say they use innovative methods that are painfree

The company explain on their website how the procedure is carried out under local anaesthetic. The surgeons can remove up to 6000 individual hairs from one part of the head or body and then replant them in follicles on the head where hair has thinned. The group say their method is superior to skin grafts using scalpels as it eliminates stitches and scarring.

They say patients will see the results within 16 weeks.

Tufnell tweeted before his first treatment that he was 'nervous but excited to see the results' and is clearly already pleased with the results.

The cricketer isn't the first male celebrity to get a hair transplant to boost their barnet. Footballer Wayne Rooney, chef Gordon Ramsay and The X Factor's Louis Walsh are among those who have also had the treatment.
