Just married! Johnny Depp, 51, and Amber Heard, 28, - pictured here together January 10 this year - have tied the knot at their home in Los Angeles, according to People 

MailOnline have reached out to representatives for the couple who have so far been unavailable for comment.

PageSix has reported that the guest list will be a modest 50 people at the Bahamas ceremony, and that Amber will wear a dress by Stella McCartney.

Another source reported by E! recently revealed that Johnny, 51, who has two children, Lily-Rose, 15, and Jack, 12, with ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis, couldn't wait to make Amber, 28, his wife.

The source said: 'He's completely in love and can't wait!'.

Happy news: It is the first marriage for Amber, although Johnny was previously married to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985

Bespoke (of course!)

There’s no doubt that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp made quite the entrance at last night’s Met Gala. Johnny could have lost the cane but other than that we think this couple looked flawless.

From his iconic Ralph Lauren ensemble to her Giambattista Valli Haute Couture gown and classic red carpet up do, the newly engaged pair couldn’t have looked more Hollywood if they tried.

When it comes to red carpet dressing, a simple gold gown has maximum show-stopping impact with minimal effort (unless you’re Rita Ora), and Amber’s modest lace number is the perfect style. Featuring a high neckline, straight skirt and long sleeves, it brings the drama without being too over the top.

Surprise! Johnny and Amber are said to have tied the knot at the home they share in Los Angeles (pictured above)

Big party ahead: The pair - pictured here in May last year - are said to be planning a bigger celebration in the Bahamas this weekend 

Second time's the charm? Johnny married first wife, make-up artist Lori Anne Allison, in 1983 when he was just 20 and she was 25, in a small family ceremony in Florida 

Despite their 14-year relationship and two children, Johnny never married French singer Vanessa.

However, it is not the first marriage for the actor, who was wed to make-up artist Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985.

Johnny was just 20-years-old while Lori was 25, when they married at a small family ceremony in Florida. 

Meanwhile, Johnny and Amber are believed to have chosen to wed this month in order to fit in with their hectic work schedules.

In sync: There had been rumours the pair were set to split, but they quashed those by attending the premiere of Johnny's movie Mortdecai in London last month 

A friend previously explained: 'She's filming a movie in London, and he's getting ready to film the next Pirates of the Caribbean in Australia. So this is the only time that everyone could get together.'

The duo's relationship was rumoured to be on the rocks last year, but a pal recently insisted they are now in 'a really good place.'

Johnny spoke to Extra in 2010 about why he hadn't got married to his longterm partner Vanessa.

'I never found myself needing that piece of paper,' he revealed.

Despite their 14-year relationship and two children, Johnny never married French singer Vanessa (pictured here in February 2005 at the Oscars) 

Family man: Johnny has two children, Lily-Rose, 15, (pictured above) and Jack, 12, from his relationship with Vanessa Paradis  

'Marriage is really from soul to soul, heart to heart. You don't need somebody to say, okay you're married.'

He added: 'If Vanessa wanted to get hitched, why not. But the thing is, I'd be so scared of ruining her last name! She's got such a good last name.'

Johnny has previously dated supermodel Kate Moss for four years, and has been engaged to Winona Ryder, Jennifer Grey and actress Sherilyn Fenn.

Hitched: It seems it was love at first sight for the pair on the set of their 2011 movie The Rum Diary
