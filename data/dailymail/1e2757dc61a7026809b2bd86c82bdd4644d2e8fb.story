It has long been though that a comet struck Earth 12,800 years ago, bringing an end to the Ice Age.

This event was thought to have not only sparked climate change, but also killed America's earliest people and caused a mass animal extinction.

But a new study suggests this comet theory is false, as most supposed impact indicators at 29 sites are too old or too young to be remnants of an ancient comet.

Theories that a comet struck Earth at the end of the Ice Age 12,800 years ago (artist's illustration shown) may be wrong, according to a new study. The researchers say evidence for dating at 29 impact sites across North America suggesting a comet sparked a brief period of cooling after the Ice Age is flawed

Controversy over what sparked the Younger Dryas, a brief return to near glacial conditions at the end of the Ice Age, includes a theory that it was caused by a comet hitting the Earth.

As proof, proponents point to sediments containing deposits they believe could result only from a cosmic impact.

One
 theory is that the circulation of warm tropical weather in the North 
Atlantic was shutdown by an influx of fresh water from Lake Agassiz in 
in mid-North America and deglaciation.

This, some scientists say, explains why the 1,300-year deep freeze occurred after the Ice Age ended.

Another theory is the impact hypothesis, which suggests a comet slammed into the planet and led to widespread cooling.

Volcanic activity has also been suggested as a cause.

A
 sizeable eruption, with one culprit potentially being the Laacher See 
volcano in Germany, could have significantly changed temperatures in the
 northern hemisphere.

Now a new study disproves that theory, said archaeologist David Meltzer of the Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

Meltzer is lead author on the study and an expert in the Clovis culture, the peoples who lived in North America at the end of the Ice Age.

His research team found that nearly all sediment layers purported to be from the Ice Age at 29 sites in North America and on three other continents are actually either much younger or much older.

Scientists agree that the brief episode at the end of the Ice Age - officially known as the Younger Dryas after a flower that flourished at that time - sparked widespread cooling of the Earth 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years.

But theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous; they range from changes in ocean circulation patterns caused by glacial meltwater entering the ocean to the cosmic-impact theory.

The cosmic-impact theory is said to be supported by the presence of geological indicators that are extraterrestrial in origin.

However a review of the dating of the sediments at the 29 sites reported to have such indicators proves the cosmic-impact theory false, said Meltzer.

Meltzer and his co-authors found that only three of 29 sites commonly referenced to support the cosmic-impact theory actually date to the window of time for the Ice Age.

The findings, 'Chronological evidence fails to support claim of an isochronous widespread layer of cosmic impact indicators dated to 12,800 years ago,' were reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

'The supposed impact markers are undated or significantly older or younger than 12,800 years ago,' report the authors.

'Either there were many more impacts than supposed, including one as recently as five centuries ago, or, far more likely, these are not extraterrestrial impact markers.'

In North America, the Ice Age was marked 
by the mass extinction of several dozen genera of large mammals, 
including mammoths, mastodons, American horses, Western camels, two 
types of deer, ancient bison, giant beaver, giant bears, sabre-toothed 
cats, giant bears, American cheetahs and many other animals, as well as
 plants.

Scientists agree that a brief episode at the end of the Ice Age sparked widespread cooling of the Earth 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years. But theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous including the cosmic-impact theory based on sites in places like Quebec

The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis rests heavily on the claim that there is a Younger Dryas boundary layer at 29 sites in the Americas and elsewhere that contains deposits of supposed extraterrestrial origin that date to a 300-year span centered on 12,800 years ago.

The Younger Dryas period is also known as the Big Freeze.

It was a period of cold climatic conditions
and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 
years ago.

Scientists believe this change in climate was caused by a 
meteor impact, but another theory is that it was because of the collapse
 of the North American ice sheets.

During the period, forests in Scandinavia were replaced with a glacial tundra.

There was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in Asia.

The
 drier conditions caused drought in the Levant, known as the region of 
Syria or the Eastern Mediterranean, which led inhabitants to 
agriculture.

The change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation.

The deposits include magnetic grains with iridium, magnetic microspherules (microscopic spherical particles), charcoal, soot, carbon spherules (small spheres), glass-like carbon containing nanodiamonds and fullerenes (molecules made entirely of carbon) with extraterrestrial helium, all said to result from a comet or other cosmic event hitting the Earth.

Meltzer and his colleagues tested that hypothesis by investigating the existing rock layers (known as stratigraphy) and chronological data sets reported in the published scientific literature to determine if these markers dated to the onset of the Younger Dryas.

They sorted the 29 sites by the availability of radiometric or numeric ages and then the type of age control, if available, and whether the age control is secure.

The researchers found that three sites lack absolute age control: at Chobot, Alberta, the three Clovis points found lack stratigraphic context, and the majority of other diagnostic artifacts are younger than Clovis by thousands of years.

At Morley, Alberta, ridges are assumed without evidence to be chronologically correlated with Ice Age hills 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) away, while at Paw Paw Cove, Maryland, horizontal integrity of the Clovis artifacts found is compromised, according to that site's principal archaeologist.

The remaining 26 sites have radiometric or other potential numeric ages, but only three date to the Younger Dryas boundary layer.

At Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico (pictured) Meltzer and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic-impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the Younger Dryas onset, suggesting the cosmic-impact theory is wrong

At eight of the sites, the ages are unrelated to the supposed Younger Dryas boundary layer, as for example at Gainey, Michigan, where extensive mixing of artifacts amongst the rock layers found at the site makes it impossible to know their position to the supposed Younger Dryas boundary layer.

Where direct dating did occur, it was some time after the 16th century AD according to the researchers.

At Wally's Beach, Alberta, a radiocarbon age of 10,980 purportedly dates extraterrestrial impact markers from sediment in the skull of an extinct horse.

In actuality, the study claims the date is from an extinct musk ox, and the fossil yielding the supposed impact markers was not dated, nor is there evidence to suggest that the fossils from Wally's Beach are all of the same age or date to the Younger Dryas onset.

At nearly a dozen other sites, the authors report, the chronological results are neither reliable nor valid as a result of significant statistical flaws in the analysis, the omission of ages from the models, and the disregard of statistical uncertainty that accompanies all radiometric dates.

For example, at Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico, Meltzer and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic-impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the Younger Dryas onset.

The authors go on to point out that inferences about the ages of supposed Younger Dryas boundary layers are unsupported by replication in more cases than not.
