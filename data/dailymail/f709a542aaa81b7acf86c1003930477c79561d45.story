It has been a tale of one coach, seven captains and 49 debutants. Those are some of the figures that lay behind the southern hemisphere hoodoo that continued to haunt Warren Gatland as Wales suffered a tenth straight defeat at the hands of Australia.

Some say it is a psychological barrier, but Wales were simply not good enough at the Millennium Stadium. After leaking three sloppy first-half tries, they somehow found themselves ahead with six minutes left on the clock. Cue two late kicks from Wallaby fly-half Bernard Foley as the hosts once again coughed up a winning position – and not for the first time in their run of 21 consecutive defeats to the ‘big three’.

It is a painful never-ending story that simply doesn’t want to finish, made worse by injuries across the back-line to Leigh Halfpenny and Dan Biggar.

This was a chance to lay down a final marker before the two countries meet at next year’s World Cup, but Gatland believes his side, who face Fiji next week, still have more to offer.

‘There’s going to be a different beast that’s facing Australia in that Pool game,’ said Gatland. ‘Our time together will be a big upward curve and we’ll continue to get better. We have pushed the players right to the edge over the last two weeks but there are a lot of things we didn’t cover.’

Gatland was keen to take positives from the defeat, but that will not appease supporters who watched Wales make too many mistakes. Training has been focussed on fitness, but a lack of skills work was exposed.

‘It’s pretty frustrating,’ said Gatland. ‘I’m not happy with the result but I’m pretty happy with the performance; the way we played and how positively we played. We missed two one-on-one tackles, which they’ve scored, and we threw an intercept pass. For a side that’s just come together, I think we showed a huge amount of positives.’

The Australian game plan was clear from the start. After Alex Cuthbert clumsily knocked on from the kick off, the Wallabies shipped the ball wide and had Israel Folau run into George North’s outside-centre channel within 30 seconds. Only a captain’s turnover from Sam Warburton brought an end to the early onslaught.

Gatland was bold with his selection. Experienced front-row Adam Jones will play no part in this series, while fellow Lions Mike Phillips and Gethin Jenkins were both dropped to the bench for the opening fixture.

In-form Rhys Webb took the place of Phillips and the gamble paid early dividends when the 25-year-old went over for the opening try after three minutes. Biggar, Halfpenny and Sam Warburton all combined in attack, before the No 9 sniped from the base of the breakdown for the try, which Halfpenny converted.

Build up in the Welsh camp has been geared towards narrowing the speed deficit between the regional competition and the southern hemisphere Super Rugby tournament. While GPS data has showed that most Welsh players are used to covering 55 metres per minute at club level, their Australian counterparts are used to playing at above 75mpm. The objective was to play at that speed, while keeping errors to a minimum.

But the home defence cracked after a quarter of an hour. Australia skipper Michael Hooper used his low centre of gravity to plough through a weak tackle from Biggar, finding Folau on his inside shoulder for a dash over the line. Foley converted to level the score.

It was disappointing to see empty seats at the Millennium Stadium, but that is the side-effect of charging £60 for a general sale ticket. Supporters would rather save their money to watch the All Blacks in two weeks time and they would expect to see far less mistakes than experienced in the first half on Saturday afternoon.

While Webb showed his danger with the opening try, he was at fault for handing the visitors a 21st minute lead. After Jamie Roberts broke through the defence, Wales played up until the unlucky 13th phase, when Webb through a 20-yard miss pass that was intercepted by Folau. No one was going to catch the mercurial full-back as he cantered in from 80 metres.

North was seen as a weak link given his unfamiliar position, but the Saints winger made the break to bring Wales back into the game. With the Australian defence all at sea, the 22-year-old cut inside Adam Ashley Cooper to create the opening for Wales’ second try. 

Alex Cuthbert got on North’s shoulder and exploited a two-on-one to level the score with the aid of Halfpenny’s conversion.

Then struck a huge double blow for the hosts, as Halfpenny was turned over and concussed at the same breakdown. It signalled the end of his game and Tevita Kuridrani – the cousin of Wallaby legend Lote Tuqiri – broke through the tackle of Cuthbert and Alun Wyn Jones, punishing Welsh errors with another easy try. He was to be joined on the injury list by Biggar, who suffered a strained groin.

‘We’ll have to sit down as a group and bring another 10 in for next week,’ said Gatland. ‘We’ll see how the next 48 hours go with Leigh. It’s an opportunity for us to give him a rest next week and perhaps look at Liam at full back.‘

The introduction of Cory Allen for Halfpenny allowed Wales to revert to a more familiar line-up, with North switching back to the wing. The Welsh forwards had not dominated up front as they expected, but just before half-time Warburton tapped a quick penalty, allowing Jones to crash over and leave the half time score at 21-21.

With three British and Irish Lions and more than 300 international caps on the bench, Wales were able to unload a wealth of experience in the second half. Two further penalties from Foley edged the hosts back in front and Gatland sent on both Phillips and Jenkins.

The Wales front-five was expected to dominate the scrum, but did little more than hold their own. Only the introduction of Jenkins along with Scott Baldwin in the front-row seemed to provide the impetus. A huge drive provided Wales with go forwards ball and North almost crashed over after 61 minutes, only to be denied by the Television Match Official.

Five minutes of re-set scrums followed and referee Craig Joubert eventually awarded a penalty try, to the delight of the home crowd. Replacement fly half Rhys Priestland converted to give his side a one-point lead.

Wales had been in this position in so many times before and the curse of the late score has become their hoodoo. History was about to repeat itself. Australia built up the phases and Foley got in position for the drop goal. He made no mistake, before adding a second from the tee to rub salt in the wounds; it was to be another case of Welsh deja vu.
