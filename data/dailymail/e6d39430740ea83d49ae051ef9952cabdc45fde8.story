For the first time since the introduction of permanent shirt numbers, Manchester United find themselves without a number 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15.

This odd sequence has been brought about following a summer of departures, as Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Nemanja Vidic have all called time on their glittering careers at Old Trafford.

It only underlines the size of the reconstruction job that Louis van Gaal faces in the coming weeks as he attempts to rebuild his defence and add some stardust to the final third.

With the start of the Premier League season just over three weeks away, Sportsmail assesses who is likely to be filling some of the most iconic shirt numbers in United’s history....

Fantastic talent: Luke Shaw, watched by Ryan Giggs

No 3 - LUKE SHAW

Following the exit of Evra, the £31million Luke Shaw is likely be offered the No 3 shirt and United hope that it will be his to wear for the next fifteen years.

He has already impressed United’s coaching staff by returning to pre-season training one week early and he has also been given the seal of approval by United great Denis Irwin, who describes Shaw as ‘fantastic player with great pace’.

Even before the departure of Evra to Juventus on Monday, Shaw had been told that he would be the club’s first-choice left back this season and it is a testament of United’s confidence in this 19-year-old that he may start the season as United’s only player in this position.

Alex Buttner has also left for Dinamo Moscow, leaving Shaw unchallenged, but United are considering a move for another left-back, although Thomas Vermaelen, if he is signed, would offer cover in that position. No 5 - Mats Hummels/Thomas Vermaelen/Stefan De Vrij

Van Gaal has identified German World Cup winner Hummels as his prime defensive target but there is also a realistic recognition that it may be difficult to cut a deal with Dortmund this summer.

The Dutchman also remains keen to sign Arsenal defender Vermaelen who, at 28, offers Premier League experience. The player is understood to have agreed a wage package in principle with United and he is hopeful of completing a move to the club this summer.

Only last week, Vermaelen was pictured holidaying with United forward Robin van Persie and the pair’s great friendship, forged at Arsenal, is believed be one factor that has persuaded the Belgian to push for the move.

Arsene Wenger, however, is proving a troublesome stumbling block and even though the player’s contract is set to expire in 12 months time, the Arsenal boss is reluctant to allow another defender to leave following the exit of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City. If a replacement can be found - or if United offer a player as a makeweight - a deal should be done.

Stefan de Vrij is also expected to arrive at Old Trafford and a deal worth £8.5m could be struck in the coming weeks.

No 7 - Angel Di Maria/Memphis Depay/Adnan Januzaj

The iconic shirt worn with such distinction by David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bryan Robson and George Best has now been vacant for 12 months after Antonio Valencia felt his performances were suffering due to the pressure of the responsibility and reverted to his favoured No 25.

As things stand, United have prioritised reinforcing the defensive and midfield positions, although a move for Real Madrid’s Di Maria or PSV’s Depay is not out of the question.

Many within the club are also keen for the honour to be handed to Januzaj, although his close relationship with Giggs could see him take the No 11 shirt. It may be a case of waiting until next summer when a star name can be brought in.

Time to step up: United forward Danny Welbeck

No 9 - Danny Welbeck

The No 9 shirt has brought underwhelming stints from Louis Saha and Dimitar Berbatov in recent times after happier days with Andy Cole and Brian McClair.

This shirt number has been absent since the departure of Berbatov in 2012 and with a striker unlikely to arrive this summer, United may feel that the time is right to promote England forward Welbeck from 19 to 9 as the Van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford. No 11 - Adnan Januzaj

The shirt worn by Giggs for over twenty trophy-laden years now needs filling. Giggs himself does not want the shirt number retired, although it is believed to have been suggested as a tribute by some.

United, however, are taking the view that they should produce one great player after another and that it should be seen as an honour to follow in Giggs' footsteps.

Januzaj leaned heavily on the current assistant manager for advice last season and the two worked closely on the training ground. He is the one player at the club with the potential to step into the Welshman’s shoes.

No 15 - Daley Blind

Blind was a star performer for Van Gaal at the World Cup with Holland and as the Dutchman prefers to operate with a smaller squad of around 22 or 23 players, the Ajax man’s versatility appeals greatly.

Blind, who would cost around £14m, would offer cover for Luke Shaw at left back and also act as a useful stop-gap in central midfield as Michael Carrick recovers from injury.

He has also earned a reputation as a big-match player, successfully carrying out a fierce man-marking job on Alexis Sanchez in Holland’s 2-0 win over Chile in Brazil.
