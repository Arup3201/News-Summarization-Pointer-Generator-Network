Would you go to a concert where you watch a video of a popstar that doesn't really exist?

It might sound bizarre, but it’s the latest craze currently taking Japan by storm - and the star herself has now made her way to the US.

Named Hatsune Miku, the computer generated character sings songs created by her fans using voice software and then performs for wild crowds on a screen at the front of an arena.

A virtual popstar called Hatsune Miku (shown) has made her way to the US. The character was designed as a mascot for software called Vocaloid 2. Now fans have created songs for her and regularly watch her in concert. She has a huge following in Japan and recently performed in New York

Hatsune Miku was created by Japanese music technology company Crypton Future Media.

She was originally intended as just a mascot for voice software called Vocaloid 2, made by Yamaha.

But when users of the software were given the ability to make her sing songs they had written, it quickly became apparent she had the makings of a worldwide superstar.

She has proved to be a smash hit in Japan, and last week performed in New York for the first time, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in the Manhattan Center Studios.

The character appears as a 16-year-old girl that has her hair in pig tails and her name translates as the ‘first sound of the future’ - perhaps heralding a belief she will lead to a revolution in the music industry.

Miku is a digital avatar created by Japanese technology firm Crypton Future Media that customers can purchase and then program to perform any song on their computer.

She is supposed to be 16 years old and five foot two inches tall but her makers have given little away about her personality.

Crypton uses voices recorded by actors and then puts them through Yamaha’s Vocaloid software to create its characters.

Miku’s voice was created by taking vocal samples from the voice actress Saki Fujita. All of the samples contained a single Japanese sound which when strung together would create full words and phrases.

Her music and image have proved so popular that she has now gone on a sell-out tour where thousands of fans wave light sticks and scream as if she is a real-life pop star. 

While her voice is synthesised, its origins come from Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita.

And perhaps one of her most interesting aspects is that all the songs she performs ‘live’ are created by her own users, in a sense being crowdsourced.

‘It's not just celebrating the idol; the fans are celebrating themselves,' said Cosima Oka-Doerge, the global marketing manager at Crypton, according to Fast Company.

Crypton says more than 100,000 songs have been made by fans, in addition to more than 170,000 YouTube videos and more than a million works of fan art since she was 'born' on 31 August 2007.

When Hatsune Miku performs, fans wave glow sticks wildly and sing along to her songs.

She sings her most popular songs on stage, initiates 'call and response' routines with the crowd and dances around as well - just like a real popstar.

Being a virtual star, though, she can also do things that her real counterparts cannot - such as exploding in a shower of light. 

Hatsune Miku has even toured with Lady Gaga, appearing ‘on stage’ during her Artpop Ball concert in Atlanta in May this year.

It remains to be seen quite how big an impact she'll have in the West, though. 

Earlier this year a hologram of the late Michael Jackson was projected at the Billboard Awards in Las Vegas.

The eerily realistic projection 'sang' and 'danced' to Slave To The Rhythm and even moonwalked across the stage.

The onstage resurrection garnered a standing ovation by the audience, who were clearly moved by the performance nearly five years after the legendary performer's death - but it almost didn't happen at all.

Only several days before the awards ceremony did a federal judge rule that the Billboard Music Awards could use the hologram, rejecting efforts from tech companies seeking to block the digital performance.
