Dawn Kyle became addicted to bingo and withdrew up to £800 a day from the accounts of her victim

A carer who stole more than £42,000 from a frail man of 65 to bankroll her bingo addiction has been jailed for 15 months.

Dawn Kyle, 61, became addicted to bingo and withdrew up to £800 a day from the accounts of her victim who was now in debt, a court heard.

Kyle, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, admitted four offences of theft between January and October 2009 totalling £42,140.

Judge Roderick Newton told her: 'What you did over a period of time was to steal a substantial amount of money from someone who was a childhood friend and who relied on you for his well being.'

The judge said the OAP, of nearby Ipswich, was now penniless and was having to deal with creditors who wanted their bills paid.

'The message needs to go out that in circumstances such as this there can only be one sentence,' warned Judge Newton.

'My duty is such that I would be failing if I didn't send you to prison.'

Matthew Gowen, prosecuting, told Ipswich Crown Court that Kyle's victim had become a heavy drinker after his marriage collapsed 20 years ago.

He had been diagnosed with manic depression and reduced brain function.

The vulnerable man lived independently but needed help with his day to day needs.

Kyle, who had known him for decades since their schooldays, began cleaning his house and cooking for him.

She became his carer but started plundering his money as his health deteriorated.

'This was a gross and flagrant breach of trust,' said Mr Gowen.

The victim spent some time in a residential care home in 2009 and his cousin spotted that property had vanished from his house and alerted police.

Mr Gowen there was no evidence Kyle had stolen any property from the house.

But it emerged that a 'huge' number of cash withdrawals had been made from his accounts.

Mr Gowen said Kyle had taken out over £4,000 while at Mecca Bingo and Joy Wheel in Ipswich.

At other times she had made cash withdrawals on an almost daily basis of sums of up to £800 and had also used her victim's money to pay the £4,700 deposit and six months rent on her flat.

Kyle told cops she had three credit cards which were 'maxed out' and claimed she had made the withdrawals with her victim's consent.

Judge Durr, defending, said that after initially playing on fruit machines Kyle had become addicted to bingo.

He said she had looked after the victim for 15 years before succumbing to temptation in 2009.

Mr Durr said Kyle had cared for her husband until he died and was currently looking after her elderly parents who were in poor health.
