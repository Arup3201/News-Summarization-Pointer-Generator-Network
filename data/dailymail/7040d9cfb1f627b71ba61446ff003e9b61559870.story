More than half of British families will have just one child by 2022, experts predict.

The number of single-child families has grown by almost 12 per cent in the last decade, according to official figures.

This means the proportion of parents stopping at one child is already at 47 per cent.

By 2021, 50 per cent of number of UK families with have one child. The number rose from 42 per cent in 2003, to 47 percent in 2013. Having one child continues the bloodline but means less commitment 

And sociologists warn it is inevitable that the figure will soon pass the 50 per cent mark.

Professor Frank Furedi, a sociologist at Kent University and author of Paranoid Parenting, said: ‘The number of families with one child in Britain will be more than half within seven years.

‘For many people, having one child is like an insurance policy.

‘It fulfils their need to carry on the bloodline without having to make as much commitment.’

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics’ study on families and households, show the trend is affecting all types of families.

The proportion of married couples with one child grew from 37 per cent to 40 per cent from 2003 to 2013.

First-borns have long been thought to be the most successful child in a family.

But new research suggests their younger siblings actually do better – because they are spurred on to top their achievements.

Researchers from the University of Essex examined primary school test results and GCSE scores to see how the success of first-born children in school affected their younger brothers and sisters.

They found having an older sibling boosted a child’s learning by as much as spending an extra £670 on schooling could achieve. The effect is even more pronounced in less well-off families.

Study authors Cheti Nicoletti and Birgitta Rabe said older children can pass on their knowledge, help with homework, or give tips about school and teachers, for which parents might have less experience.

Some youngsters succeed by imitating a high-achieving older sibling, for example by copying their work style, while others do better by trying to be different.

The ‘sibling spillover effect’ could even explain why Ed Miliband, for example, beat older brother David to become Labour party leader.

Unmarried cohabiting couples with one child grew from 51 per cent to 53 per cent in the same period, and single parents with one child jumped from 52 per cent to 58 per cent.

James Davis, 37, and his wife Sal Thomas, 39, who live in Manchester with their son Edgar, 22 months, said they decided to stop at one child because it would give all three of them the best quality of life.

‘Sometimes I feel there’s quite a lot of pressure to get a sibling for your child,’ said Mr Davis. ‘People tend to frown on it and some have even told us we are being cruel. We have created a good work-life balance and we are very lucky to have a great child.

‘Introducing a new character into the mix could change that. We are conscious that we have to get him socialised. We take him to play group almost every day and arrange at least one play date at the weekend.’

Freelance writer Vicky Charles, 33, from Salisbury, who is raising her two-year-old daughter Samaire on her own, told the Sunday Times: ‘Being a single parent with an only child, there’s not a lot of space for little emperors.

‘Samaire still sleeps in my bed and we have a close bond ... I would hate her to feel pushed out. If I had another child there’s a chance she would feel like that.’

Academics think that some small families do better because they do not have to share resources – but there are drawbacks.

Professor Ann Buchanan, an expert in social work at Oxford University, said: ‘Research in China has shown that most children from single child families do exceedingly well.

‘However, there is concern about higher suicide rates. The pressure on lone children is greater and this can lead to mental health problems.’

Single child families aren't rare - they are already the most normal size for a family in Britain - but the figure is rapidly on the rise

Hand-me-downs and shared bedrooms will soon be a thing of the past for most - within the next decade, half of all families will have just one child.
