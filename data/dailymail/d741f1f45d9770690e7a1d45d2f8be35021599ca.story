The world's foremost euthanasia clinic, Dignitas, is to sue the Swiss police after their officers tried to revive a terminally ill woman who fell asleep during an assisted suicide.

Police stopped the procedure near Zurich after the patient lost consciousness after only consuming half the drugs meant to kill her, and therefore officers assumed that her suicide attempt had failed.

The unnamed woman was meant to finish the lethal cocktail of barbiturates and police say their rules state that if a patient is still alive two hours after taking the drugs they will call an ambulance.

'Abduction': Dignitas claim the woman was illegally taken from their clinic near Zurich, pictured, and want the Swiss police prosecuted

Following the intervention the woman in her 60s, who was suffering from a genetic disease and weighed 
only five stone, was rushed to hospital were she later died.

Under Swiss law, a state official - 
usually a police officer - must be present to monitor proceedings when 
an assisted suicide is being conducted.

And Dignitas now want the police to be prosecuted for 'interfering in a legal assisted suicide' and 'abducting a patient' during the incident on August 2.

Suicide: Patients at the clinic consume a cocktail of barbiturates dissolved in a drink to kill them, pictured at a different assisted suicide, but on this occasion the woman fell asleep before finishing it

'Because of the woman's weight she had already taken enough of the drug to die,' a Dignitas spokesman said.

'The police acted in a random and provocative way against the wishes of 
the woman's closest family, who were at her bedside the whole time.'

The woman was first given a drug in a glass of water to prevent vomiting, then 30 minutes later she began drinking a lethal dose of barbiturates dissolved in fruit juice.

In almost all other cases at Dignitas, the patient finishes the glass then begins to feel drowsy with ten minutes before moving from anaesthetised unconsciousness to coma then dying of respiratory arrest.

But in this case, the 67-year-old woman only managed to finish half the glass before she fell asleep, and the lower dose of the fatal drug meant she took longer to die, Dignitas said.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the controversial Dignitas 
clinic has attracted scores of patients from the UK, where helping 
someone to die is a criminal offence that can lead to a murder charge.

A minister for the Swiss government's public affairs department said today an independent inquiry would be launched into the matter.

But the police are standing firm and say their actions were the right ones.

'The suicide procedure had clearly failed because she was not dead after two hours,' a spokesman for the Zurich prosecutor's office.

'Police acted to avert any suffering that might have ensued on the patient's behalf.'
