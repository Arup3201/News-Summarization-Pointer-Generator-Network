It is a TV so big it simply won't fit into even the biggest of living rooms.

The world's largest TV has been unveiled by Austrian firm C SEED Entertainment Systems - and has a whopping 201inch screen.

It will set owners back £414,000 - the equivalent of buying four Porsche 911 cars.

The C Seed 201 is the world's largest TV with a 16-foot wide LED screen

The set is so big it can only be kept outside because there isn't a house large enough to keep it in

However, for owners worried it just won't fit inside, don't panic - the firm behind it says it is perfect for private yachts.

Its screen was designed by car maker Porsche, and is made up of more than 725,000 LEDs.

These LEDs display 4.4 trillion colours and the screen has biometric fingerprint sensors built-in to prevent people from using the TV without the owner's permission.

When the TV is switched off it can be folded up, using seven folding panels, and hidden away.

The screen can then be opened by pressing a button on the remote control.
