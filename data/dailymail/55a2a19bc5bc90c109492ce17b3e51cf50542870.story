A fierce local derby was marred by violence and a pitch invasion last night as about 12 people were arrested and three police officers were injured.

Mounted police were called in to clear the pitch at Ashton Gate after Bristol City fans celebrated their victory over rivals Bristol Rovers.

Avon and Somerset Police said about 12 people were arrested and three offices received medical treatment for non-serious injuries.

Police in riot gear and stewards were also required to keep rival fans apart following disturbances in the stands.

The match was the first time in seven years the bitter rivals had faced each other.

Police said the build-up to the game had been peaceful with both sets of fans well-behaved and in good humour.

But as fans began to enter the stadium for last night's Johnstone’s Paint Trophy first round match, small isolated pockets of anti-social behaviour broke out in and around the ground.

Police said known hooligans attached to both clubs were identified and so far around a dozen people had been arrested.

Chief Superintendent Caroline Peters, match commander, said police and stewards were able to clear the pitch of supporters in a matter of minutes.

She said: 'The majority of fans were well behaved and enjoyed the match.

'However there was a small minority who came with the sole intention of trying to spoil the enjoyment for the majority.

'We warned before the match that we would not tolerate any form of anti social behaviour or violence.

'We
will now aim to bring the offenders to justice using CCTV coverage and 
other intelligence and information gathered tonight to bring the 
offenders to justice.'

Jay Emmanuel-Thomas put the hosts ahead in the 12th minute with a long-range strike.

Rovers equalised just before the hour mark when Mark McChrystal headed in a free-kick.

But Bristol-born Joe Bryan struck an impressive winner to send City through to the second round.

City manager Sean O’Driscoll said afterwards: 'It was great up until the final whistle. The scenes at the end are disgraceful.'

The new season is not even a month old but it is not the first incident of crowd trouble in English football this term.

Disturbances: A steward was trampled by a police horse as Preston fans invaded the pitch last month

Tom
Clarke’s 87th-minute winner for Preston against bitter rivals Blackpool
sparked ugly scenes last month which ended with a steward being 
trampled by two police horses and taken to hospital.

The Lancashire derby atmosphere boiled over when hundreds of home supporters flooded the Deepdale pitch at the final whistle.

And
on Saturday police were pelted with bottles and missiles after trouble 
broke out between Port Vale and Wolverhampton Wanderers fans after the 
local rivals League One clash. Officers arrested 23 people during the 
violence.

After the 
final whistle, the trouble spilled over into nearby Burslem town centre 
in Stoke-on-Trent, where missiles were thrown at officers and a marked 
police car was smashed up.

Staffordshire
Police said it was 'confronted by a significant group of home fans' 
involved in 'violent disorder' who had gone out of their way to target 
police lines.

There were reports innocent bystanders were also caught up in the melee.

Nine
people were detained before kick-off while another four were arrested 
during the match for offences including setting off flares and going on 
to the pitch.

Two adults also suffered dog bites from police dog units and were treated by paramedics according to the force.
