Wigan boss Uwe Rosler is emerging as a candidate for the Celtic manager's job.

The Scottish champions are looking for a new boss following Neil Lennon's departure last week.

And Sportsmail understands Rosler has been identified as a potential successor to Lennon at Celtic Park.

Potential: Uwe Rosler has impressed since taking over at Wigan and leading them into the Championship play-offs

The former Manchester City forward's work in England, firstly with Brentford and now Wigan has been admired by Hoops chiefs.

Whether Rosler would consider a move north of the border, particularly with the Latics expected to be among the Championship promotion favourites next season, remains to be seen.

But he features on a shortlist that also features Owen Coyle and Malky Mackay.

In the hunt: Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay has been out of work since leaving the Welsh side

Candidate: Owen Coyle has managed Burnley, Bolton and Wigan and has experience of managing in Scotland
