A Catholic Church official has said angels do exist - but that they 'do not have wings or look like cherubs'.

Father Renzo Lavator, an 'angelologist', said the heavenly beings, which are 'back in fashion' thanks to New Age religions, are in fact more like shards of light.

'You do not see angels so much as feel 
their presence,' he said at a conference on angels in Rome. 'They are a bit like sunlight that 
refracts on you through a crystal vase.'

Speaking at a conference in a lavishly-frescoed Renaissance palace in Rome, he added: ‘I think there is a rediscovery of angels in Christianity.'

The first mention of the word ‘angelos’ came from the Mycenaean 
civilisation in Greece more than 3,000 years ago.

The word means ‘messenger’ in ancient Greek.

The
 supernatural beings are depicted in many religions and mythologies, 
usually with feathered wings on their backs and halos above their heads.

In Christianity, angels are generally considered messengers of God.

The senior clergyman was taking part in a
 debate this week on angelic art by the Fondazione Archivio Storico, an 
Italian art foundation, and was held in the Vatican-owned Palazzo della 
Cancelleria.

‘Following the cultural history of angels is following the history of humanity, or at least of our civilization,’ the organisers said.

‘Angels have helped drive religious and philosophical thought and have given birth to sublime forms of poetic and artistic expression,’ they said.

Mr Lavatori said the popularised 
image of angels is a necessary result of their being ‘back in fashion’ 
but is dismissive of all the angel art around Christmas.

‘There
 is space for that, but you have to understand that these are not real 
representations. Angels do not have wings or look like cherubs,’ he 
said.

The widely-published Catholic clergyman is also a ‘demonologist’ and says angels are more needed than ever because increasing secularisation and materialism in society have left an ‘open door’ for the devil.

‘There is a lot more interference from diabolical forces. That is why you see queues of people outside the exorcists' offices in churches,’ he said.

‘Pope Francis talks more about the devil than about angels and I think rightly so. But it's still early, he will get round to the angels too.’
