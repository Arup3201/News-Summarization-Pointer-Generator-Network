A former British Airways captain who blew the whistle on a pilot who took off despite having a collision on a runway, has lost his £110,000 claim that he was unfairly forced out by his new employer.

Whistle-blower Captain Graham Howard said he was sacked for bringing an ‘unwelcome focus’ on Blink Ltd after taking his worries to the Civil Aviation Authority.

The 63-year-old - who has 35 years' flying experience - raised his concerns after a series of incidents the company, which charters planes for celebrities and businessmen to 600 European destinations.

Capt Howard claimed that a colleague risked committing a criminal offence by flying a damaged plane without getting clearance after the runway incident in Salerno, Italy.

In another alleged blunder, the same pilot flew an over-fuelled plane and failed to report the error correctly to the authorities.

However Capt Howard failed in his claim for £110,000 in lost earnings after the tribunal panel ruled he had, in fact, been dismissed for attempting to force the removal of Capt Paul Horrocks.

Capt Howard told an employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, that Capt Horrocks flew an aeroplane with a damaged wing after he hit a fire extinguisher before take-off in Salerno, Italy, causing £24,000 worth of damage to the small commercial aircraft on June 23, 2013.

He said the pilot with Blink Ltd failed to inform maintenance staff of the crash and took off just minutes later.

Capt Horrocks also flew from France to Blink Ltd's base in Surrey with an over-fuelled plane and failed to report the error correctly, Capt Howard claimed.

He reported the incidents to management and called for Capt Horrocks to be dismissed, but he was allowed to continue flying.

Capt Howard then reported the incidents to friend and Civil Aviation Authority official, Frank Zubiel and claimed that he was sacked by Blink Ltd director, Cameron Ogden, for bringing an ‘unwelcome focus’ on the company, which was founded in 2008.

Employment judge Robert Salter agreed that Capt Howard speaking to Mr Zubiel counted as a public interest disclosure but dismissed Capt Howard's claims today.

Giving his judgement, he said: ‘The respondent argued that it terminated [Capt Howard's] contract not because he had made a protected disclosure but because of the manner in which he appeared to enlist Frank Zubiel in the removal of Captain Horrocks.

‘The tribunal is satisfied that the protected disclosures did not materially affect the decision to terminate the contract.

‘Mr Ogden believed that the claimant's conduct was serious and affected the reputation of the respondent, thereby entitling the respondent to terminate the contact without notice.’

Capt Howard, from Crowthorne, Berks, had earned £45,000 per year for three days’ work per week and was later employed as chief training captain and chief pilot at Blink Ltd., based at the small Blackbushe airfield in Camberley, Surrey.

He later agreed to work for the company as a contractor through his own company, ATH Training, for £400 per day.

Mr Ogden, the son of IT giant Computacenter founder Sir Peter Ogden, said had concerns about Capt Howard's erratic attendance, refusal to retrain Capt Horrocks following his overweight landing, and him drinking alcohol on company premises.

Judge Salter added: ‘The respondent has shown that the reason for the detriment was not the protected disclosure and the claims made by the claimant are not well founded and are dismissed.’

Capt Howard said he felt the decision was ‘perverse’ and would be discussing the matter with his legal team, but added that he would not be appealing the decision.

‘I had a position which I felt I needed to defend and in the main I have been vindicated,’ he said.

‘I won't be getting any compensation but I have lost on a technicality really.'

He said that the tribunal had cost him £25,000 in legal fees.
