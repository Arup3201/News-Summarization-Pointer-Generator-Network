The row over televised Election debates took a new turn last night following claims that David Cameron could take part in one after all.

A senior television executive said ITV may ‘break ranks’ with the other major broadcasters in an attempt to include the Prime Minister in its debate.

ITV won the right to screen the first of two proposed debates featuring seven party leaders. 

The BBC is scheduled to broadcast the second while a final head-to-head clash between Cameron and Ed Miliband would be shown on Sky and Channel 4.

All the debates are planned take place in April but Cameron insists he will take part in only one debate involving seven party leaders – and only if it takes place before the end of March.

So far the broadcasters have adopted a united stand in an attempt to ensure all three debates go ahead. 

But there were claims last night that ITV could agree to the PM’s request to bring the first debate forward.

The source said: ‘There are bound to be voices in ITV saying that if the only chance of getting the PM in a TV debate is to advance it a few days, then ITV would be irresponsible to refuse to do so.’ But a source at a rival broadcaster said: ‘It would be a disgrace for ITV to stab us in the back.’
