A man is accused of tying up his girlfriend on Halloween night before assaulting her and photographing the attack because he objected to her French maid costume.

Jennifer O'Gallagher alleged her boyfriend John Chapman committed the assault inside a Nanticoke, Pennsylvania apartment building, according to a police affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun.

'A female yelling and screaming for help' prompted Nanticoke police to respond shortly before 4:45am, the affidavit of probable cause written by Sgt. Brian Williams said.

After speaking to a bystander, who told police the sound of the noise emanated from an apartment building, Williams and Officer Lee Makowski 'could also hear the female crying, yelling get off of me, leave me alone,' the document said.

'We observed a hallway window smashed across the hallway and the female was still crying screaming get off of me, leave me alone,' Williams wrote.

Police then spoke to John Chapman, who 'said his girlfriend Jennifer O'Gallagher is flipping out and he was trying to stop her,' the document said. 

Williams also wrote O'Gallagher said at the scene 'Thank God the police are hear [sic].'

O'Gallagher had visible injuries and told police she had been assaulted by her boyfriend, according to the affidavit.

Speaking to police, O'Gallagher said the couple returned to the apartment on Friday afternoon, and that both she and Chapman drank vodka roughly at 5:00pm, the affidavit says.

In her account, 'At approximately 7:00pm she and Chapman were getting their Halloween costumes on so they could go out for the night,' the affidavit said. 'Jennifer said Chapman seen [sic] Jennifer's French maid costume. Chapman became upset and started to argue with her. During the arguement he stripped Jennifer naked and then bound her wrist and ankles together.

O'Gallagher also told police she was able to use a knife on the ties after Chapman went out around 11:30pm.

Though O'Gallagher had locked the apartment doors, she told police that 'Chapman would return several times trying to get back into the apartment,' Williams wrote. 'Jennifer would tell him each time to go away he drunk [sic] and not coming in.

'Finally around 3:30am John return [sic] and smashed out the bedroom window Jenner said the glass landed on her because her bed is under the window.'

Though O'Gallagher had attempted to hide herself, the affidavit said 'Chapman found her and dragged her from the closet onto the floor and started to grab and choke her again. Jennifer said it continuted for about and hour [sic] until police arrived.'

Police arrested Chapman for simple assault, unlawful restraint, and harassment, the document obtained by The Smoking Gun reveals.

According to the website, Chapman is inside Luzerne County jail 'in lieu of $20,000 bail.'
