A young bride has been left devastated after her husband was killed in a car accident - less than 24 hours after they walked down the aisle.

Jordan Costa, 21, was driving his wife 21-year-old Heather Favazza-Costa on Interstate 77 in Jefferson Township, Ohio, on Sunday, the day after their wedding in Canton Township, Michigan.

The pair had enjoyed a happy ceremony and reception and were heading south to enjoy a honeymoon in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Honeymoon: The young couple, pictured with relatives, were traveling to Myrtle Beach when Mr Costa was killed in a car accident. His new wife escaped with minor injuries

Nanny Heather Favazza-Costa was clearly a proud new bride who had already 
changed her name on her Facebook account and added a picture of the couple feeding each other 
wedding cake.Â 

However, during the journey Mr Costa lost control of their 2002 Ford Escape. The car hit the median and an embankment before rolling over several times.

Mr Costa, a youth program leader at Connection Church, died as a result of the collision while his wife was hospitalized with minor injuries.

Pastor Rocky Barra who officiated over the wedding paid tribute to the young newlywed in a statement to tell his shocked congregation about the accident.

'I was so very honored to officiate the wedding ceremony of Jordan Costa and Heather Favazza. Heather has, literally, grown up in our church. Nancy and I dedicated her as a baby, watched her grow through her teenage years, and become the beautiful bride she was on Saturday,' he said.

'Jordan Costa has been a huge part of our youth ministry. He was a youth leader, and was the facilitator of our college and career ministry. He was definitely a handsome groom, with his family in attendance from his home out east.'

Young love: The couple posted pictures of their proposal, pictured, and engagement online. Mrs Favazza-Costa had already changed her name and proudly uploaded photographs of the wedding before the accident

'Crushed': Mr Favazza said he was devastated for his daughter after she lost her new husband in the crash

Heart-broken: The pastor who married the couple told of his grief at the news. The young couple were very much in love and Mrs Favazza-Costa had posted numerous pictures of her engagement ring online, pictured

'I was called out of our first service on Sunday to find out that Heather and Jordan were in a terrible car crash while they were driving south for their honeymoon. Toward the end of the second service, I received the horrible news that Jordan had died. They had been married for less that 24 hours. Thankfully, and miraculously, Heather had no broken bones.'

'Our heart is broken for Heather, and the entire Favazza family.'

Ohio Highway Patrol is still investigating the crash but told Click on Detroit that no other vehicles were involved.

The couple's Facebook accounts were filled with photographs from the happy day just hours before they set off for their vacation.

Kind words from well-wishers wishing them a happy future together were quickly replaced by heartbroken comments and condolences.

Heather's father George Favazza wrote: 'Prayer is the only thing that helps I am crushed for my daughter.'
