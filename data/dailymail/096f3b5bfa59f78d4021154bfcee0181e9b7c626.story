A giant dog named Joker and a small pony called Tigger have become the best of friends thanks to the fact they are almost identical.

The pair's friendship blossomed when their owner Ronnie Jones introduced them at her stables in Summercourt, Cornwall.

Three-year-old Joker, a Harlequin Great Dane, has distinctive black and white markings which are very similar to the coat of Tigger - a miniature spotted stallion.

The pair share similar black and white markings and since Tigger (left) is just 34 inches tall, the two animals measure up at about the same height. They are said to be inseparable and get taken on walks together

And since 15-year-old Tigger is just 34 inches tall, the two animals measure up at about the same height.

Owner Ms Jones, 63, often takes them for walks together, putting them both on dog leads and parading them through her village.

She said: 'It is such a pleasure for me to have two animals that get on so well - they're the best of friends - even if we do get some funny looks.'

Despite the age gap, the pair have been inseparable since Ms Jones got Joker as a puppy.

On walks, Joker sidles up to Tigger and the pair settle next to one another at Ms Jones's stable when she goes to muck out.

When Ms Jones take Tigger to horse shows all over the country, Joker goes along for the ride and watches patiently from the sidelines.

Ms Jones said the animals became friends when she got Joker (right) as a puppy. She now lets them cuddle up to each other, play together and takes them on walks together. They are often mistaken for each other

Ms Jones, a sculpture, has owned Great Danes and horses for over 20 years. 

Tigger has previously been crowned Champion Miniature Stallion at the Horse of the Year show and Supreme Champion Miniature Horse at Rawlington National Horse Show.

She said: 'It's adorable to see them next to each other - they snuggle when they're next to each other, and Joker goes in to kiss Tigger on the nose.

'But when they are out together they tend to get a lot of double takes.

'We regularly get people pulling out their camera phones to snap the phenomena of a horse and pony the same size strolling through the village.

'We once even have a lady pull up in her car at red lights, wind down her window to take a picture and then cause a traffic jam behind her because the lights had changed!

'But although they are real sweeties, it's important to remember that they are both energetic animals.

'Great Danes are big and strong and need a lot of exercise - owners have to make sure they've got enough space to provide that for them.

'They are very powerful dogs, it's easy to rush in too quickly - I feel lucky that I can offer them a home in the countryside with plenty of room, for Joker as well as Tigger.

'Most of the Tigger and Joker are very well-behaved but I am very careful when we're out in the fields - I'd never want their gently playing to get out of hand and become a full-on chase.

'It's about being a responsible owner and understanding the needs of both animals.'
