Some people can literally wait a lifetime before they find true love - and for one 83-year-old Canadian more than seven decades would pass before she married her childhood sweetheart.

Carol Harris, of New Brunswick, had all but given up on walking down the aisle, having stayed single all her life.

But as fate turned out, she did finally receive a marriage proposal - and it was from someone she had first met as a young girl in 1936.

Just married: Carol Harris, 83, got married for the first time to her childhood sweetheart, George Raynes

She and George Raynes were just eight-years-old and each other's first kiss, during a school production of Sleeping Beauty.

After high school, Mr Raynes moved to Ontario, married and raised three sons, while she stayed in Saint John and remained unmarried.

Her hopes of one day wearing a wedding dress began to fade as the years passed by, said Ms Harris.

'I always felt that Iâ€™d like to be 
married, up until last April. And last April, I finally gave up. I said,
this is ridiculous.'

All that changed however when Mr Raynes' wife of 61 years passed away and he moved back to New Brunswick.

The pair reconnected, a romance blossomed and it was not long before he asked her to marry him.

'Yes - well, that was my answer,' she said.

Following their wedding in Saint John, Canada, last weekend, Ms Harris said she is still getting used to her new status, as well as wearing wedding and engagement rings.

But having been single for so long, she admitted that she loves having someone 
else to share her home with.
