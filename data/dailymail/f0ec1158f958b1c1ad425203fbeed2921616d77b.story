The deadliest and most advanced weapons in the world are currently being displayed for top military brass at a conference centre in east London.

The Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) weapons conference at the ExCeL centre is the largest arms fair on the planet, featuring state-of-the-art vehicles, firearms, protective equipment and communications technology.

Its website describes it as a 'must-attend' event that 'brings together the entire defence and security industry to source the latest equipment and systems, develop international relationships, and generate new business opportunities.

The arms fair 'provides a unique opportunity for government ministers, senior civil servants and all politicians with an interest in UK defence and security exports to see this vitally important industry in action', the website says.

James Cook of The Kernel was one of the few journalists allowed to attend the event.

He described it as 'one of the most secure places in the world' and said there are five different security checks and a large number of armed police.

'DSEI is home to a mind-boggling array of weaponry. Missiles, assault rifles and drones are all on show,' Mr Cook said.

'I ask my handlers what kind of people attend a weapons conference and they look mildly uncomfortable, before eventually telling me that as well as representatives of foreign governments, there are also private defence contractors shopping for weapons.

'Weapons dealers and exotically-dressed army officers examine rifles in detail, pulling triggers, staring down barrels and occasionally making “pow” noises before they place them back on the perspex rack.'

The biennial event draws a large crowd of protestors who object to arms dealers being able to display their wares on British soil.

The event has been blasted by the Green Party's Caroline Lucas, who claims illegal torture weapons are being promoted there.

Ms Lucas said the French company MagForce International and the Chinese company Tianjin MyWay International Trading are promoting the weapons at the DSEI arms fair in London's Docklands.

The Brighton Pavilion MP said it was not the first time illegal weapons, such as handheld projectile electric shock weapons, weighted leg cuffs and stun batons, have been found at the arms fair.

The two companies were later ejected from the conference and their stands removed by organisers.

A statement from DSEI said: 'We can confirm that the Tianjin Myway International Trading Co. and Magforce International have been ejected from DSEI having been found with literature in breach of our compliance policy.'

Ms Lucas welcomed the news but says more steps must be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again.

She said: 'I am very pleased that they have been ejected but I think it is enormously worrying that it takes a question in Parliament to make DSEI do their jobs properly.

'One can have no confidence that the policy on selling illegal weapons is being upheld properly at all.

'It's frankly disgusting that items like this are being promoted at a supposedly legitimate trade event in Britain,' she added.

'Time and again the organisers of DSEI have shown that they cannot guarantee that exhibitors will remain within the law.

'It's time for the Government to take action and shut down this event once and for all.'
