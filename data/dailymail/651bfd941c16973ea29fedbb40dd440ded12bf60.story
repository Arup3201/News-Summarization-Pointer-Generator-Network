'I want to progress now with Burnley again and hopefully kick on in the next year.

'I had a few other offers from clubs who wanted me to go on trial but as soon as the opportunity came up here to get another contract it was what I wanted to do.'

Elsewhere in the Burnley development squad, there have been new deals for Tom Anderson and Steven Hewitt, with 12-month extensions exercised on the contracts of Cameron Howieson and Jason Gilchrist. Anderson has signed on for another year and Hewitt for two.
