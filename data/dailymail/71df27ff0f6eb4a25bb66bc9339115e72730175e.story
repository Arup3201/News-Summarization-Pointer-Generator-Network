A retired astronaut was killed after his son crashed into his jet ski with the one he was riding.

Captain Alan G Poindexter, 51, was on a stationary jet ski with his 22-year-old son yesterday afternoon when his 26-year-old son crashed into them with another one.

An emergency responder told the Pensacola News Journal: 'Zachary hit the rear of the jet ski the father and his brother were 
on.

'Captain 
Poindexter was then knocked off his jet ski.'

Poindexter was pulled from the water around 1.30pm at Little Sabine Bay, Pensacola Beach in Florida where friends performed CPR.

The married father was taken to Baptist hospital but died a short time later, said a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission official.

An investigation is underway.

His son Samuel, 22, who was riding with him, and brother 26-year-old Zachary Poindexter were not injured.

The retired astronaut is married to Lisa Pfeiffer Poindexter, originally from Florida.

Poindexter, known was 'Dex', piloted the Atlantis space shuttle in 2008.

On their Facebook page, NASA wrote: 'The NASA family was sad to learn of the passing of our former friend, and colleague Alan Poindexter who was killed today during a jet ski accident in Florida.

'Our thought and hearts are with his family.'

Captain Alan G Poindexter, known affectionately to colleagues as 'Dex', was a decorated naval officer and space shuttle pilot.

The married, father-of-two gained a masters of science in aeronautical engineering before serving as a naval pilot from 1988.

He made two deployments to the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Storm and Southern Watch.

He was selected for NASA in 1998, rising to commander of shuttle Discovery in 2010.

An astronaut colleague Gregory Johnson wrote on Twitter: 'He was a talented, courageous Navy veteran with gifts.

'Dex was a lovable guy with a strong work ethic.'

The astronaut was born in Pasadena, California but grew up in Rockville, Maryland. Poindexter went to high school in Coronado, California before receiving an associate's degree in engineering from Pensacola Junior College in 1983.

He went on to Georgia Tech, graduating with a bachelor's degree of aerospace engineering in 1986 before earning his masters from the Naval Postgraduate School.

Following military service, he was 
selected by NASA in 1998. He made his first trip into space in 2002 to 
the International Space Station.

The assignment was cut short two months 
later in February 2003 after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 
which all seven crew members died.

He piloted another mission to the International Space Station in February 2008. His most recent trip to space was aboard Discovery in 2010.

Poindexter logged 27 days and 21 hours in space over the course of his two missions.

Prior to his missions, he told the Rockville Gazette: 'I feel privileged and honored to have flown.

'It's been a tremendous ride, looking back on the legacy and accomplishments, like the Hubble telescope and the launching of the International Space Station in 1998.'

At the time of his death, Captain Poindexter was dean of students  and executive director of programs at the Naval Postgraduate School.
