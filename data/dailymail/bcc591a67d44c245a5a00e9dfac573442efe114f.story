While many students who just completed their high school studies have taken a well-deserved holiday within Australia, there are those who decide to venture a little further.

In Kuta, Bali, overnight thousands of teenagers celebrated the unofficial beginning of the overseas Schoolies Week at nightclubs and bars throughout the party hot-spot.

Around 6000 students will travel to the popular Indonesian island in search of cheap drinks, all-night parties and other adventures in the coming weeks.

A former fishing village, Kuta is one of Indonesia's first and most popular tourist destinations boasting beautiful beaches and a pumping nightlife. 

Bikini tops for women and a lack of shirts at all for men seem to be the uniform of choice, and while most of the party-goers seem to be there just to enjoy themselves, many more are a little more mischievous.

Many Schoolies took the opportunity to escape the spotlight of the Gold Coast, instead flocking to Kuta

It's no secret that when recent high school graduates head off to celebrate Schoolies week all they want to do is let loose.

They're drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, passing out, getting naked, running wild on the streets and documenting it all on social media. 

But some of the teenagers living it up seem to be making drunken decisions that they will have to carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Partygoers are getting inked as a permanent reminder of their celebrations, as tattoo parlours on the Gold Coast reveal they have been flooded with customers in the past few days. 

One extreme teen even went as far as to take the homemade option, carving the word SCHOOLIES into the skin on his stomach with a sharp implement.

Gold Coast tattoo artists have been swamped by customers looking for a long-lasting souvenir 

One artist from Frontline Tattoo said one of the most popular requests this year from teenage men has been the letters FTB - which supposedly stands for 'For The Boys'. 

'One guy asked to get it tattooed on his ass cheek,' Rob Domerelli told Courier Mail.

Another nearby parlour - Custom Iron - said they had a group of men front the shop who asked for batman tattoos.

Their reasoning: 'They told me they were getting it because they wanted to fight crime', manager Lindsay Hall told the website.

This trio of Schoolies went for a more temporary approach on the tattoo front with temporary face tattoos inspired by the Hangover movies

Queensland: Surfers Paradise

New South Wales: Byron Bay

South Australia: Victor Harbor

West Australia: Rottnest Island or Dunsborough

Victoria: Surf Coast or Phillip Island 

Overseas: Schoolies are also heading to Bali, Fiji, Thailand and Vanuatu 

'Thirteen schoolies were arrested overnight on 16 charges for mainly public nuisance and street related offences with police pleased with the overall crowd behavior at the Surfers Paradise schoolies celebrations,' Queensland Police said in a statement.

'Of the 13 male schoolies arrested eight were for drug offences relating to cannabis and ecstasy.'

The statement also revealed: '80 schoolies given liquor infringement notices for drinking in a public place' while 12 more were given to non-schoolies for the same reason.

Meantime the celebrations at the Victor Harbor Schoolie's Festival in South Australia wrapped up on Monday.
