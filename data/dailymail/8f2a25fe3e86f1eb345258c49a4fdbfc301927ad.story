A five-time Buffalo wing-eating champion known as El Wingador has been sentenced to seven years in jail for cocaine possession and distribution.

William Simmons, 51, became a legend in Philadelphia and his hometown of South Jersey for his ability to devour 162 chicken wings in 32 minutes at the annual Wing Bowl competition.

However in a staggering fall from grace, the Woodbury Heights resident was today indicted on several drug related charges after police found $8,000 worth of powder cocaine and $4,000 in cash in the car he was driving last year.

The father of three said he was struggling to make ends meet and had no choice but to deal drugs.

The sentence came on the eve of Simmons' beloved gluttony contest, traditionally held on the Friday preceding the Super Bowl.

'I'm here to accept whatever you feel I deserve,' a tearful Simmons told Superior Court Judge Christine Allen-Jackson in front of about six supporters. 'I'm willing to accept my punishment as a man.'

Philly.com reported Simmons may be eligible for less time if he completes an intensive supervision program and could be released in several months.

Before sentencing, Assistant Gloucester County Prosecutor Alec Gutierrez said: 'Mr Simmons may not be a bad person. He made a bad decision.'

Simmons said he began selling drugs 
after several business ventures failed and he could not find a decent 
job to support his wife, Debbie Martinelli Simmons, and three children.

'It started out a small thing and it just escalated into a monster of a thing I was doing,' he said.

'I promise my friends and family that I will rise above this. I have to make things right again.'

NJ.com reported Simmons said in a statement he felt bad for 'letting down' his family and friends.

'I fell into a financial situation that I couldn’t get out of,' he said. 'I did all the wrong things for the right reasons.'

Police arrested Simmons in June last year after finding cash and cocaine in a 
2010 Kia Soul he was driving which bore his celebrity moniker.

Investigators
also searched two residences in Woodbury Heights linked to Simmons.

The former Gateway Regional High School football player won his first Wing Bowl crown in 1999 and his last in 2005.

He retired after reaching the top of the pecking order in the 1999, 2001- 2003 and 2005 Wing Bowl contests.

He returned in 2011 but was beaten by Jonathan 'Super' Squibb who managed to eat 255 wings across the 30 minute contest - worth around 25,000 calories.

In 2012, Simmons came third and was arrested six months later.

He has licensed wings under his brand name, appeared in KFC commercials, and concocted his own home-recipe barbecue sauce.
