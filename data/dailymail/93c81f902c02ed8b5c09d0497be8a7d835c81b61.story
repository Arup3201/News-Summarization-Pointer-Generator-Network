A classic Ferrari could become one of the world's most expensive ever cars when it goes on sale next month.

It is regarded as one of the most sought after classic sports cars and will be the star lot when it goes under the hammer at a sale by RM Auctions in America on January 18.

The auction house is not publicly revealing the car's estimated value, only describing it as 'one of the finest of its class'.

But a similar model sold for more than £3.1 million in 2011, with the price expected to have risen significantly due to increased market interest in classic Ferrari models.

The alloy-bodied 250 GT SWB, known as chassis 1905 GT, is fitted with a three litre V12 engine developing 280bhp, impressive capability for a car built in 1960.

The car, designed by renowned Italian designers Pininfarina, can achieve a 0-60 mph time of less than six seconds and a top speed in excess of 150mph.

The 250 GT was the 17th model in the series to roll off the production line in 1960 and has had four owners in the last 52 years.

Shelby Myers, from RM Auctions, said that such cars 'rarely' go for sale on the public market.

He said: 'There is nothing that trumps the magnificent style, drivability, and sound of the 250 SWB Berlinetta. 

'Ultra-exclusive, it is certainly one of the most desirable Ferraris ever produced. 

'Its irresistible combination of superb design and thrilling performance make it the car of choice for gentleman drivers and racers.

'Outstanding in every respect, 1905 GT is, without question, one of the finest of its class.

'A true dual-purpose automobile, on the road it performs flawlessly while its magnificent styling has been widely admired at the world's top events and makes it a fantastic candidate for further exhibitions. 

'Rarely do such important cars come to public market.'
