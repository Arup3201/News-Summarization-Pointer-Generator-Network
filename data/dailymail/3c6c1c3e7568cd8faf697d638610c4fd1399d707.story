Intel has unveiled a walking, talking robot that can sing, translate and even tweet - and can be printed at home.

The white 2 foot tall robot, called Jimmy, is being turned into a 3D printable plan chipmaker Intel will release later this year.

Partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits and it is hoped the robot will cost less than $1,600.

Intel's Jimmy the Robot: the walking, talking robot on Wednesday made from 3D-printed parts that will be available to consumers later this year, if they are willing to assemble it with a kit that costs around $1,600

Intel is planning to release the plans online for free, and allow people to modify them.

Partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits.

The robot has a metal 'skeleton' but 3D printed body parts can be attached to it.

Parts can be customised so each robot is unique.

A high end industrial version pre-assembled will also be available for around $16,000 and is designed for researchers and industrial applications.

The company's Chief Executive Brian Krzanich was accompanied by 'Jimmy' on stage at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.

The white 2-foot tall robot shuffled onto the stage, introduced itself and then waved its arms.

Intel describes Jimmy as a research robot, but the company intends to make 3D-printable plans available without charge for a slightly less advanced version, and partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits.

Jimmy can be programmed to sing, translate languages, send tweets and even serve a cold beer.

Under Krzanich, who took over a year ago, the chipmaker is trying to be an early player in emerging technologies like smart clothing, after coming late to the mobile revolution and making little progress in smartphones and tablets.

Its strategy includes engaging tech-savvy do-it-yourselfers and weekend hobbyists working on everything from Internet-connected baby blankets to robots and drones.

Owners of the robots will be able to program them to perform unique tasks.

They can then share the programs with other owners as downloadable apps.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, hopes the price for the robot kits will fall below $1,000 within five years.

Intel is planning to release the plans online for free, and allow people to modify them.

'What's so exciting about the open source model is the public gets involved in developing this first generation of crowd-sourced, consumer robots,' said Intel Researcher Brian Johnson, who is leading the project.

'We all get a say in what they do, and together we will come up with far more ideas, more innovation, and more creativity.'

Johnsonâ€™s team has already shared the template for a pilot robot, Jimmy, with 10 teams at various universities, to download, print, and program their own smart mascots.

Separately on Wednesday, entrepreneur Bill Gross announced plans for a 3D printer that would sell for $149, far less than devices that now typically sell for $1,000 or more.
