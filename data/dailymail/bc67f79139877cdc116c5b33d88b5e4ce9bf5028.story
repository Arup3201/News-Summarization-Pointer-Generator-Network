A woman was landed with a £12,500 mobile bill after she accidentally used her phone to download repeats of sitcom 'My Family' while on holiday.

Patricia Al, 23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy via her O2 phone. 

Miss Al was on holiday in Bodrum in Turkey and using the hotel Wifi to download the series from iTunes onto her laptop. 

But the Wi-Fi connection cut out and her phone - which was hooked up to her computer while it was charging - took over the download.

Patricia Al,  23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with a £12,000 bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy My Family  via her O2 phone while in Turkey

The My Family Complete Boxed Set is priced £32.86, which contains all 120 episodes of the BBC One show, which ran for 11 years from September 2000

The glitch meant that the intern property consultant was charged an incredible £5,156, 97 for one episode and £5,453.80 for another - a total of £10, 611.

Ms Al was also charged over £2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday, and returned home to a total bill from O2 of £12,520.87. 

The figure could buy 323 complete box sets of the all 11 series of the hit show.

Luckily for Miss Al her father has offered to foot the bill.

She said: 'I'd bought the entire series on iTunes and wanted to download them so I had something to watch on the plane on the way home.

'I didn't want to download all the episodes at once, so I set up my laptop to download them one at a time.

'Every day I would plug my phone into my laptop to charge, set up the downloading on the hotel Wi-Fi and go off for a swim.

'I had no idea what had happened until I got a message from O2 on my last day of my holiday, saying my phone may have been stolen, because my bill was so large.

She was charged £5,156, 97 for one episode and £5,453.80 for another - a total of £10, 611. Ms Al was also charged over £2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday

'I had a look online at my bill, and I couldn't believe my eyes - it was more than £12,000.

'From the looks of things, the free hotel Wi-Fi must have cut out twice and my phone automatically took the internet access.

'It's quite scary really, I didn't press anything - I had no idea something like this could happen, and I want to warn others.

'It's really quite embarrassing - I had to ask my father to bail me out.'

Her O2 bill shows that on August 21 and August 23, two blocks of around 900mb of data were used by Patricia's iPhone working as a modem.

She added: 'Nobody in their right mind would deliberately use such large amounts of data on their mobile - I can't believe that O2 actually sent me the bill.

'I admit that I was using my phone quite a lot while I was away, checking emails and such, so I was expecting a larger than normal bill.

'I take responsibility for that - taking off my data cap. But the size of the final bill is just ridiculous. Surely nobody would deliberately run up such big charges?

'I tried ringing O2, but they were very unhelpful. The money is due to come out of my account next week, so I'm having to beg my dad for help.

'I can't believe O2 didn't even have the courtesy to send me a message saying I was using such astronomical amounts of data - I bet they were just rubbing their hands with glee.'

The total came to more than 40 times her usual bill amount. Luckily for Miss Al - who lives in Chelsea, her father has offered to foot the bill

The bill total, running from August 20 to September 20, came to an astonishing £12,520.87 more than 40 times her usual bill amount.

She added: 'I just wanted something to watch on the plane home, My Family isn't even my favourite show.

'I realised I hadn't seen the eighth series, so bought it on iTunes. Now I've ended up paying for the most expensive television episodes ever.' 

O2 say Ms Al's bill was allowed to escalate to over £12,000 because she had opted out of the 50mb roaming data cap and the £120 overseas bill limit.

Contact your network operator before you leave: Often they have cheaper bundles or tariffs available if you know you're going abroad

Ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use, to stop your bill spiraling.

Turn off auto-updating of apps or email retrieval: Again this means you won't use any data allowance

Use mobile websites instead of full desktop view: This will save data per page

Turn off data roaming all together: If you don't want to use the internet when you're away

Mobile network Three has scrapped roaming charges altogether for UK customers using the company's 'Feel At Home' service. 

It is now available in a total of 16 countries. Others on the list include USA, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark and Republic of Ireland.

O2 said they texted her on August 24 to let her know her bill had reached £5701.86 on the day she accidentally downloaded the first episode.

The phone giant has since reduced her bill by £6,644.97 - for the data she used after August 24 until the end of her holiday.

An O2 spokesperson said: 'We are clear with customers on the charges they can expect from overseas mobile phone usage.

'Our O2 Travel service caps this usage and we advise customers to think carefully before they ask us to remove it.

'We would also advise customers to be careful when using their mobile phone as a modem for their laptop while overseas.

'If your hotel WiFi signal drops out, the data charges will be carried over the overseas mobile phone network and as a result be added to your mobile phone bill.

'As a gesture of goodwill, we have applied a £6644.97 credit to her account - the additional usage charges she incurred while using her mobile phone in Turkey.'

But Ms Al said: 'They told me they sent me a text, but when I told them I didn't receive it until the end of my holiday, they said there must have been a problem with the Turkish service provider.

'There quite clearly wasn't any problem with the Turkish phone company signal, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to accidentally download the show twice.'
