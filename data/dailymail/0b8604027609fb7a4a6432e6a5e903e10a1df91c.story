Douglas Hewitt has put up the same Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it in 1929

A great-grandfather has put up his Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it from a toy shop in 1929.

Douglas Hewitt, 84, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born and he and his wife Mavis, 82, have once again put it up this year.

Mr Hewitt's father bought the tree from Redgates toy shop, in Sheffield, just months after Douglas was born.

The 4ft tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years and remains the centrepoint of the Hewitt family household during every festive season.

Mr Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said: 'It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that.

'They all come and look at it and smile, it's become part of the furniture.

'If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas. It would be different.'

The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951.

Mrs Hewitt said: 'Douglas was born in 1929 and they went into Redgates and asked for a Christmas tree and they didn't have any.

'The only one that was left was in the widow so his father said, "right, we will have that".

'Year after year we have just carried on using that one. You have to be a bit more careful with it now as it's a little fragile.'

Sadly, it may be the last year that the tree makes an appearance in the Hewitt household, as it stands on its last legs.

Mr Hewitt has said the tree used to have more branches on it and had 'seen better days' but it is once again standing pride of place in the Hewitt family home

Their daughter June Murphy also has fond memories of the Christmas tree.

Mrs Murphy, 60, said: 'It was in my grandparents' home and then it was given to us.

'The lights that are on there now have been there since we went to a three-pin plug.

'It's looking a little thin now as each time you get it out something else falls off.

'It's become a bit of a family joke. 
Each year someone has to comment "not again!" but it's a Christmas 
tradition of getting the tree out that we all love.

'We'd all be sad to see it go as I think it would be hard to find such a loved replacement.'

Mr Hewitt said: 'There were a lot more branches on it, and it's lost it's feathers that were all along the edge.

'There were little candle holders on the ends and little legs on it, but unfortunately they're been lost over the years.

'It could be its last outing, as it's seen better days.'
