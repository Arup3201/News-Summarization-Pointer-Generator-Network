A woman has become mother to a third set of twins  - beating staggering odds of 500,000 to one.

Keeva and Ceira, were born in June last year to their mother Sara Jones, 33, from Southport, Merseyside.

The babies have increased her brood to ten, as she also has four other children.

As a family they get through eight pints of milk and two loaves of bread per day as well as two bulk-size packs of nappies a week.

But despite her unusually - and unpredictably - large family, Sara, who has a pair of identical twin sisters herself, says her home life could not feel more normal.

Triple the trouble: Sara Jones holds the latest additions to her brood, Keeva and Ceira. Her first twins were Niamh, far left, and Liam, far right, both ten, and Shay and Aoife (centre), both two, are now two.

'For most families having twins is something out of the ordinary ... [but for me] it would almost be weird for me to fall pregnant and not have twins,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

Her story began 10 years ago when she gave birth to Liam and Niamh.

She then split from their father Rhys before beginning a new relationship with her current fiance Craig Morgan, 31.

Then in 2010 she learned she was pregnant with more twins - Shay and Aoife, now two.

And as if that were not enough, she also has children Brogane, 16, Siobhan, 13, Calam, 12, and Sean, four.

'They keep me on my toes,' she said. 'Some families can’t have 
children, so I see every single one as a blessing.'

While she said the second pair's arrival was' a bit daunting', by the time Keeva and Ceira were born, she 'knew what [she] was doing'.

But it is not always easy.

Craig is an unemployed furniture maker while, for her, bring up the children is a full time job so it can be a strain to make ends meet.

'We have to budget very strictly,' Sara added. 'I try to get 
everything for about £100 a week, but every day I go to the supermarket 
and spend ­another £15 to top up.'

And because each of her children is 'unique', she says, she refuses to make the youngest wear hand me downs.

In spite of the pressure to feed and clothe each child separately, Sara says she would not want it any other way and believes each one of them will 'have a best friend for life'.

'And I’m hoping they’re all going to look after me when I’m a pensioner,' she added.
