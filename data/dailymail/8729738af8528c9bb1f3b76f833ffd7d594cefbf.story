The opening title sequence of The Crazy Gang is about to finish when Dave Bassett’s mobile phone lights up with text messages from former Wimbledon players.

There is a sense of betrayal, an injustice after their former team-mate John Fashanu claimed he ruled the old dressing rooms at Plough Lane by fear and intimidation. ‘I was the leader,’ he announced.

‘Let me tell you a bit about Fash because those players wouldn’t have followed him down the pub,’ scoffed Bassett as he watched the 90-minute documentary screened by BT Sport Films on Boxing Day.

Bassett is a proud man and this film has wounded him.

The Crazy Gang could and probably should have been the fairytale, the real, gritty story of Wimbledon’s remarkable rise from champions of the Southern League in 1977 to FA Cup winners 11 giddy years later.

‘None of the players cried, it’s complete nonsense,’ added their former manager. ‘Fashanu has betrayed us.’

There is no mention at all of Bassett’s masterplan to replicate the success of Don Revie’s Leeds side of the Seventies, or the 13 homegrown players he promoted from the youth team during his six-and-a-half years as manager. 

The likes of Glyn Hodges, Steve Galliers, Steve Ketteridge, Mark Morris and captain Brian Gayle have been forgotten, consigned to history. Instead they have been portrayed as a team of thugs.

Bassett, who was among those paid to appear in the programme, added: ‘Fash has disrespected the legend of the club and the legacy has been tarnished because of his contribution to the programme.

‘He has embellished stories and played up to the camera. He should have been honest and shown respect to those who played alongside him and to those who achieved so much before him.

Bassett is proud of the job he did at Wimbledon but doesn't believe the documentary reflected them properly  

Bassett and Fashanu walk on the beach during their days at Wimbledon - but the manager says his former striker has embellished a lot of the stories 

‘It is a shame and players from that great Wimbledon team are very disappointed in him because he has attempted to glamorise something that was already very special. 

‘I am still really proud of what we all achieved, but Fash has tucked us all up.

‘Everything that team went on to achieve, even after I left and Bobby Gould won the FA Cup with them a year later, is unlikely to be repeated.’

Bassett signed Dennis Wise, who had been released by Southampton and rejected by QPR and Crystal Palace, on the recommendation of his young forward Wally Downes. He was eventually sold to Chelsea for £1.6m and went on to play for England 21 times.

Goalkeeper Dave Beasant, who saved John Aldridge’s penalty in the FA Cup final, went to Newcastle for £850,000. Andy Thorn went to St James’ Park for the same fee. The list goes on.

‘Fash has made it sound like we were animals, but we worked hard on the training ground and had some very good players,’ added Bassett, who took over the Wimbledon team when Dario Gradi left for Crystal Palace in 1981. 

‘It wasn’t an environment where people were bullied or intimidated at all.

‘Every team had their enforcers. Jimmy Case, Steve McMahon and Graeme Souness could all look after themselves at Liverpool. Tottenham had John Pratt, Paul Miller and Graham Roberts. It was a different era and they were all tough.’

Wise, in the transcript of his two-and-a-half-hour interview with the programme makers, backs up Bassett’s passionate version of events.

‘The players enjoyed the environment,’ said Wise. ‘They didn’t feel embarrassed if they messed it up. They didn’t think they were better than each other.

Fashanu made a lot of claims in the BT Sport documentary which have been disputed by others

Like Fashanu, Jones was one of the players who glamourised the violent side of Wimbledon  

‘You could miss a volley or have a joke and no one felt uncomfortable. There’s nothing worse than going to a group and you’re feeling the pressure.’

The story about Alan Cork’s car being set on fire to claim on insurance after Bassett refused to give him a pay rise is fiction, according to Bassett.

So, too, are the images of Carlton Fairweather being tied to the luggage rack of a car and being driven down the A3 at high speed by one of the Wimbledon players. ‘It just didn’t happen like that,’ added Bassett.

So much for the intimidation and the wanton acts of violence that Fashanu, who was signed by Bassett from Millwall in 1986, and Vinnie Jones talk about during the film.

‘Nobody died,’ added Fashanu when he was asked about the Crazy Gang’s methods. It is a remark that disgusts Bassett. 

So much more could have been made of Bassett’s stats man Neil Lanham, sitting in the draughty stands to faithfully record free kicks, corners and long throws.

There is no mention, either, of the £11,000 Bassett spent on video equipment for his analyst Vince Craven. Bassett beat ProZone by 20 years.

Sadly, Wise’s anecdotes about coach Don Howe showing the team tapes of Arrigo Sacchi’s magnificent Milan side, with Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten in their pomp, were left on the cutting room floor.

Instead the temptation, inevitably, was to lap up the numerous tales readily supplied by Fashanu and Jones about techniques they claimed to have used as Wimbledon players. You can’t blame them.

Instead, Fashanu and Jones have much to answer for after this bruising appraisal of Wimbledon’s glory years.

‘When Fashanu arrived at the club he told the dressing room, “I am not in the Crazy Gang, do not cut up my clothes and I won’t cut up yours”,’ added Bassett. ‘He wanted no part in it, he was very much on his own in there at the beginning.’

To the producer and director’s great credit, Fashanu’s ability to embellish the truth is brilliantly exposed during the programme’s reflections on the 1988 FA Cup final against Liverpool.

‘John Barnes is close friend and I said things to him in that tunnel that only a black man could say to another black man,’ claimed Fashanu in a particularly awkward scene.

The next shot is of the tunnel, with the two teams lined up together and filmed live for BBC and ITV before referee Brian Hill leads the teams out. There is no hint of any exchanges between the two teams and Barnes confirms this in his own interview. ‘Fash made himself look like a buffoon,’ added Bassett.

He is also disappointed with Jones, the man he signed from Wealdstone for £10,000 in 1986 and turned into a First Division midfielder. There is no mention of the winner he scored on his home debut against Manchester United or his spell out of the team after he was sent off for sticking one on former Arsenal midfielder Graham Rix.

‘So much for the intimidation, the verbals and all this fighting because after he got sent off I didn’t play him again until the end of the season as a punishment,’ Bassett added.

Then there is the story, after Bassett left the club, of the unfortunate soul who was beaten to within an inch of his life by Fashanu behind closed doors.

That man was Robbie Turner, a journeyman striker who made the mistake of accepting Fashanu’s challenge to a fight after they had finished training one day.

‘His name was left out, probably because he didn’t want to be associated with it,’ said Bassett.

After watching this film, it is clear Bassett and many of the other former Wimbledon players now feel the same way.
