It may have been a gloriously sunny weekend so far across parts of Britain but these pictures show that the autumnal chill is not far away.

Britain this afternoon basked in temperatures of up to 28C, but earlier in the day it had been a different story as more seasonal mists rolled in, signalling the last fleeting moments of summer.

Across the Weaver Hills in Ellastone, Staffordshire, a distinctly autumnal mist rolled across the picturesque landscape, as forecasters warned temperatures are set to drop by six or seven degrees on Monday.

End of the summer? Autumn mists roll in across Weaver Hills in Ellastone, Staffordshire, signalling what could be the end of the unseasonally warm weather

With mist sweeping in across the Midlands this morning, forecasters said the warm weather will give way to more unsettled spells next week

Despite the mist it is expected to be a great weekend weather-wise for most of the UK

The Met Office say parts of Britain can expect much more unsettled conditions from Monday onwards.

Cloudly weather is expect to move 
south from Scotland next week, leading to temperatures of around 21c, 
compared to the sizzling highs of 27 and 28c this weekend in the south 
east.

In contrast to the unseasonal sun 
experienced around the UK, there are said to be thunderstorms on the way
from Monday, with the north and west of England expected to take the 
brunt of the change in weather.

Billy Payne, forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, said: ''There will be some mist and fog around at first 
today in central-southern England and the south west, but it will clear 
and most parts will be warm and dry with long sunny spells.

'Temperatures will reach around 27C 
(80.6F) in the London area and the south east of England and widely 
across England and Wales it will be in the mid to low 20s.'

It may be Autumn but holidaymakers like 6-year-old Alex Kingston are still soaking up the sun near Reeth, North Yorkshire

He added: 'In northern areas the cloud will be slower to break but there should be some sunshine in the afternoon.

'North western Scotland will be 
overcast and drizzly and it will feel quite cold with temperatures 
ranging from 15 to 18C (59 to 64.4F).'

Mr Payne said that central and 
southern areas of England will have another 'very warm day' tomorrow, 
with temperatures reaching 27C or 28C (82.F).

But he predicted that cloudy weather 
will slowly move from the north of Scotland across the north west of 
England, Wales and south west England.

'An area of low pressure will form out the the west and will bring some showery rain in the afternoon,' the forecaster added.

'There will be heavy bursts in western Scotland and also the potential of thunder storms.

'Across the whole of the country it will also be a bit more blustery.'

More autumnal weather is predicted next week with most areas of Britain seeing periods of rain.

The wettest periods will be on Thursday or Friday when there may be some fairly stormy weather, according to forecasters.

Britons were today making the most of the September sun, flocking to beaches and parks to lap up the last of the summer rays.

This weekend will follow a warm and 
dry week for most parts, which will continue today with sunny periods 
lasting longest across East Anglia, southern parts of the Midlands and 
southern counties.

Louise Smith, 29, from Wimborne, 
Dorset, was on the beach in Bournemouth with her daughter Martha, three,
but said her son had returned to the classroom this week, so he was 
missing out.

She said: ‘We’ve had such a wet summer
and I was not going to miss the opportunity to get on the beach when 
the sun finally showed.

Posed up: Under cloudless clear blue skies, the sun beats down on visitors to the Angel of the North in Gateshead today, where they were enjoying the extended summer weather which is to last over the weekend

Hot and cold: The south of England will experience the best weather this weekend, although northern parts should also do well on Saturday - while much of the country will experience showers by Monday

’I feel sorry for my son Jack, and my husband who's at work, but Martha and I are having a wonderful time together.

‘The water is perfectly clear and 
surprisingly warm and we are having a brilliant time. It’s just a shame 
it wasn’t like this during the holidays.’

Sunseekers today gathered on the beach
in Bournemouth, Dorset, while many walked along the promenade and 
Victorian pier. Ice cream vendors meanwhile enjoyed a super seasonal 
finale.

Ice cream salesman Phil Baker said: ‘It’s been really busy today considering the schools have gone back.

‘There have been lots of mums with 
very young children and quite a lot of pensioners are out and about. 
Because the sun is shining they’ve all been buying ice creams.

‘But it won’t make up for the poor 
trade through the summer. There were days when I didn’t sell a single 
ice cream, but hopefully this weekend will be busy.’

Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said the upcoming warm weekend is ‘a bit of a bonus for mid-September’.

He told MailOnline: ‘It’s well above 
average for this time of year. The best of the weather this weekend is 
going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday, but many eastern
areas will also do OK.

‘Any rain will be probably confined to
north-west Scotland, with temperatures quite widely in the twenties 
from the Aberdeenshire area all the way down to London.’

On the up: Ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years

The demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales.

Analysts say Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent, and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent.

Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007, meaning we will eat at least 500million fewer scoops a year.

Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen. Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion.

Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons. Together with the pressure on consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’
