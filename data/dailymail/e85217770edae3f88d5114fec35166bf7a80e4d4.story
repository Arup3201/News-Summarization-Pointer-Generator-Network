Neil Entwistle wants a new trial

Neil Entwistle, the British man who murdered his American wife and baby daughter, is demanding a new trial on the grounds that a police search of their family home was illegal.

He also claims the jury which convicted him was biased.

The Nottinghamshire computer engineer was jailed for life without parole over the 2006 double killing, but his lawyers yesterday (FRI) told the Massachusetts supreme court in Boston that much of the crucial evidence heard at his trial was unlawfully obtained and should be thrown out.

Entwistle, a computer engineer from Worksop, Notts, was convicted of shooting Rachel Entwistle, 27, and nine-month-old Lillian Rose as they slept in bed in the family’s rented home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

He later fled to the UK but, alerted by his wife’s worried mother and friends who could not reach her, police twice searched the house. On the second search,they discovered both bodies lying hidden under blankets in the couple’s bed.

Entwistle, now 33, was not present at yesterday’s 40-minute hearing at which his wife’s family listened intently to the evidence but left without comment.

His lawyer, Stephen Maidman, said police should have obtained a search warrant before entering the house a second time.

Although legal experts believe Entwistle may have a strong case, the judges hearing the appeal appeared sceptical.

“Two people are missing. A baby is missing. What isn’t an emergency about that?”, said Justice Robert Cordy.

Mr Maidman acknowledged the bodies would eventually have been discovered but claimed the judges risked allowing police to violate the US Constitution’s ban on “unreasonable” searches of a citizen’s home.

The lawyer also argued that jurors at Entwistle’s trial should have been questioned far more rigorously as to whether they were influenced by the huge pre-trial publicity over the case.

Prosecutors told the hearing that the jury was properly vetted by the trial judge, Diane Kottmyer, and that police had acted properly when they went into the Entwistles’ home.

Police are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if they have an “objectively reasonable basis’’ to believe there may be someone inside who is injured or in immediate danger, said law expert Christopher Dearborn. Prof Dearborn said there “is a very compelling argument that this was an illegal search”.

Entwistle’s trial heard how he was unemployed, heavily in debt and lying to his wife about his job prospects while secretly looking for extra-marital sex on the internet.

He claimed he panicked after finding the bodies and flew to Britain without alerting the police because he wanted to be with his parents.

They continue to insist he is innocent and that Rachel Entwistle was the true killer.

In 2008, prison sources said Entwistle had been tricked into shaving his head after a white supremacist skinhead gang said it would protect him after he received threats from other inmates.

But the gang then admitted it was a prank that would not guarantee his safety, adding: “We’re gonna kill you, too.”

Prison officials admitted the threats against Entwistle were serious and have transferred him to a prison with less dangerous inmates.
