Gary Ballance cracked a century to keep England in the second Test against India at Lord’s — and then admitted he had learned his lesson after his shirtless, drunken antics earlier this week.

Ballance, who was reminded of his responsibilities by England coach Peter Moores after being photographed naked from the waist up in a Nottingham nightclub on Sunday, made 110 before being caught shortly before stumps as England closed on 219 for six in reply to India’s 295.

He said: ‘It was an interesting week. It was a bit embarrassing. I was naive but I didn’t break any rules. I’ll learn from that and won’t be doing that again.

I felt a 
bit of pressure turning up on day one but everyone was backing me and 
said, “Mistakes happen”. It’s great to score runs and even better after 
what happened.’

Meanwhile,
 Alastair Cook will not be sacked as England captain despite failing 
again with the bat. Cook made only 10, taking his sequence of Test 
innings without a century to 26.

But 
Sportsmail understands his job is secure at least until the end of this 
five-match series, with no appetite at the highest level of the ECB to 
sack him.

ECB chairman
 Giles Clarke and managing director Paul Downton believe there is no 
alternative and are backing Cook’s batting to come good.
