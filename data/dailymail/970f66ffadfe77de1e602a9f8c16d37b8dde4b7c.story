A plan to make a film about the Sandy Hook massacre has been met with fury by residents and politicians.

Director Jonathan Bucari is facing a huge backlash after announcing plans to film the story of a mentally ill boy who is affected by the school shooting.

The French-born director said he wanted to film the TV movie, called 'Illness' in Ridgefield, Connecticut, just 20 miles from the Newtown school where gunman Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children, six teachers and himself in December.

But the project has been heavily criticised as it comes just two months after the massacre.

A poster for the planned film Illness, about a 13-year-old boy with mental health problems affected by the Sandy Hook massacre, was uploaded onto fundraising website Indiegogo

The script focuses on a 13-year-old boy called Benjamin, who has a 'terrible mental illness' and 'the ever-growing fear of his parents' following the school shooting.

Despite the plot Mr Bucari reportedly wrote in a posting that he was not making a movie about what happened in Newtown 'and never will do so.'

However, Mr Bucari's Twitter page appears to have been taken down and a link to the Facebook page of the film, called Illness, was no longer working on Tuesday.

The messages sent to Mr Bucari on Twitter included one from randirants, who wrote: 'j_bucari took his account down. No one wants him anywhere near Newtown. You aren't welcome here, or anywhere else.'

Another from a user called GuerillaGirl who wrote: 'From what the Newtown residents tell me (my friends) they don't want him either. Opportunist slime.'

LightTheSkySandyHook wrote: 'CT doesn't want of NEED this... Please respect us enough to stay away. Ridgefield is outraged. Families are not happy. RESPECT.'

Ridgefield resident calicab said: 'Keep out of Ridgefield and give up on a movie about the Newtown tragedy. Way to soon, way out of line, and not welcome in our town.'

The backlash began when Mr Bucari told local news stations he planned to visit Ridgefield, which has a population of 25,000, to scout out locations for the film, including a school.

Ridgefield schools superintendent Deborah Low said the timing is 'poor'.

The director, who lives in New York state, said he had chosen the town because it looks like the scene of the shooting but did not want to upset Newtown residents so soon after the killings.

Local politicians have heavily criticised Mr Bucari since the announcement was made.

Adam Lanza, 20, murdered 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut. The gunman also killed his mother and then himself

Ridgefield town leader First Selectman Rudy Marconi was quoted in Chron.com as saying: 'I will do everything in my power to prevent this.

'It's a bad idea. If you were to poll the residents in town, they'd be overwhelmingly against it.'

Mr Marconi also said they would not grant a permit to allow the crew to film in Ridgefield.

In a message on crowd funding website Indiegogo producer of the project Carina Rush asked for help in raising $3,000 to start the project.

She wrote: '"Illness" is a story about the tragic fate of Benjamin, a thirteen-year-old boy with a terrible mental illness, and the ever-growing fear of his parents after they learn about the shooting in Newtown in December 2012.'

She said they needed to raise money to pay for actors, music, post-production, and to apply for film festivals, including this year's Cannes Film Festival in the official short film competition.

Ms Rush wrote: 'We are doing the film because we believe in the power of cinema; because we believe in telling real, compelling stories.

'We believe that everyone can relate to this film and that we can make an impact on mental illness.'

She added that 'all funds and prizes' won through festivals will be used to create a foundation to help families with chidlren with mental health issues.

Mr Bucari's internet Movie Database page lists one completed directorial project, a TV pilot called The Sacrificial Lamb.

The page said he moved to the US from France in 2010 and is currently working on another film called 'Max's Fantastic Adventures'.
