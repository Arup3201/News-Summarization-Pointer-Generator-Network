The Manchester derby could have a little extra spice for Argentina team-mates Sergio Aguero and Marcos Rojo.

The two World Cup finalists were said to have exchanged angry words during this summer’s tournament after Rojo - who completed his £16million move to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday - invited his pal, Argentinian pop star El Polaco, into the dressing room after a group game.

Unfortunately, El Polaco is the former partner of City star Aguero’s girlfriend - another Argentinian pop star, Karina Tejeda.

The singers, who are stars of cumbia, a popular Latin style, have a four-year-old daughter but split acrimoniously last year.

According to newspaper La Gaceta, Aguero was unimpressed with Rojo inviting the singer into the dressing room.

Aguero and Rojo seemed to have managed their differences through the rest of the World Cup, with both appearing in the semi-final and final together once Aguero had recovered from injury. But there may be a degree of extra interest in the handshake between them when the Manchester teams meet on November 2.

As part of the deal which sees Rojo move to Old Trafford, Nani has returned to Sporting, although United will pay the 27-year-old’s £4.8million wages for the duration of his season-long loan.

Meanwhile, United have rejected reports that they were interested in signing Germany’s attacking midfielders Thomas Muller and Marco Reus this summer.

Marouane Fellaini appears destined to remain at United after he suffered suspected ankle ligament damage in training. The £27.5million midfielder was ph otographed outside a Manchester hospital on Tuesday, where he was seen hobbling on crutches and wearing a protective boot, although Sportsmail understands the Belgian has not broken his ankle.

Manager Louis van Gaal signalled his intention to sell Fellaini at the beginning of the summer but United’s attempts to move him on may be doomed following this latest setback.

However, the injury may not be as bad as first feared after Fellaini posted a picture of himself on Twitter last night, taking part in the ‘ice bucket challenge’ without the boot on.

Napoli are interested in the 26-year-old but are looking at a loan, rather than the permanent deal that United had hoped for.

With Michael Carrick ruled out until the beginning of October, Van Gaal has only Ander Herrera, Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley to choose from in central midfield, so he is keen to find a high-quality recruit before the transfer window closes.

United continue to deny they have any interest in Arturo Vidal of Juventus, but Ajax’s Daley Blind - who can operate at left back or in holding midfield - remains a target and Roma’s Kevin Strootman could be on the agenda in January.

Fellaini is still to score a competitive goal and made only 16 starts amid poor form and injury problems in his first campaign at the club.

He joins a host of United players on the injury list - Carrick, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Luke Shaw and Antonio Valencia all missed the opening day defeat by Swansea. Robin van Persie, however, is edging closer to a return and could be involved at Sunderland on Sunday.

At the Etihad on Wednesday, City  announced that striker Edin Dzeko had signed a new four-year deal.
