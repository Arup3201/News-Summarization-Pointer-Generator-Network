When Adam Scott waved a short putter to magical effect during the first round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday, he effectively consigned to history one of the most contentious subjects the game has known.

Nine months ahead of the official death knell for long putters, the great and good have seemingly imposed their own sanction.

The banishment was started by Ernie Els and Webb Simpson, who snapped his over his knee to ensure he would not be tempted any more. Then came Keegan Bradley, leaving Scott as the last man standing in terms of players who won majors using a long putter.

It was this group who forced the hands of the governing bodies when they claimed all four majors between them in the space of just 18 months, from Bradley's PGA Championship triumph in 2011 through to Scott's Masters victory in 2013.

The authorities were persuaded by the powerful evidence that less nerve was needed in anchoring a long putter to the body and the plain inequity that such a crutch could prove decisive at a major.

Hence the ban on anchoring which, by extension, meant the end for long putters.

Scott was the most high-profile since his long putter was the ugliest contraption of all. As long as he kept turning up with it in his bag, the subject rumbled on.

It was during a three-month break that the genial Australian decided it was time to change. His caddie Steve Williams had announced his retirement while Scott's wife had given birth to their first child, Bo. 

'Everything was getting a little boring so I thought why not change everything completely and ditch the putter as well,' said Scott (right), wryly. At home he experimented with a range of 50 different putters. He tried various grips and methods.

By the time he arrived in Miami, Scott was confident enough to announce he was going back to the short putter he last wielded in competition in 2011.

The 34-year-old admitted to some first-hole nerves and genuine concern as to how it would hold up over long putts. As things turned out, it went better than he could have imagined. Using the 'claw' grip favoured by Sergio Garcia, the putting stroke looked pure and he had just 27 putts in an opening round of 70.

'I'm really pleased,' Scott said afterwards. 'I've tried not to clutter my mind and I've shown myself it is not that big a deal. It helps that I used a short putter for years, so the adjustment was really to do with muscle memory.'

One or two middle-ranking players such as the Swede Carl Pettersson and South African Tim Clark still use long putters. But even here they will surely take encouragement from the example of those at the top.

As for Scott, did he ever feel like following Simpson's example and snapping his putter in two? 'It treated me pretty well, so I don't think it deserves a snapping,' he said, smiling.

Scott's two-under-par round left him in the top 10 but still eight strokes behind runaway leader JB Holmes, who carded a 62.

'That's the most unbelievable round I have ever seen,' said Ian Poulter, who opened with a 74 — one worse than world No 1 Rory McIlroy.

For Holmes, it was another heartening milestone in his remarkable recovery from brain surgery three years ago.
