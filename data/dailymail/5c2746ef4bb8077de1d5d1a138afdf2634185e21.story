Attacked: Gary Cranley, 40, feared for his son Jake when he was slashed in the ribs by a pair of thugs with a six inch knife after he told them off for swearing at KFC staff

A pair of thugs stabbed a father in front of his pregnant fiancée  and baby outside a KFC takeaway after he told them off for swearing at staff.

Workshop manager Gary Cranley, 40, was knifed in the ribs after telling the two yobs to 'show some respect' after they began hurling vile abuse and demanding to be served more quickly.

They waited for him in the car park of the KFC in Trafford Retail Park, Manchester, before launching a vicious attack.

As Mr Cranley walked to the car with his food, the thugs confronted him and challenged him to a fight claiming he had 'disrespected' them.

When he refused and got into his car with his partner Jennie Coen, 29, and seven-month old son Jake, they smashed the driver's side window.

Mr Cranley jumped out to protect his family but was then punched in the head before one of the men lunged at him with a six-inch blade.

He only narrowly avoided a life-threatening injury because he jumped back and the knife hit his ribs before the pair fled.

Mr Cranley, who has been left with two-inch gash in his stomach, cuts to his hands and a swollen ear, said: 'It's very frightening in this day and age to think that somebody would try to kill you over a petty argument about getting a takeaway dinner.

'I simply told them off because they were being being thoroughly unpleasant to the staff who were doing a good job and these guys simply over-reacted because they felt I had 'disrespected' them by ticking them off for swearing.

'I just don't know what these people would stop at. My family could have been hurt or even killed.'

Despite his ordeal, Mr Cranley said he doesn't regret confronting the yobs.

'I
 wasn't scared of them,' he said. 'I wasn't going to
 let them behave like that. I just don't like people who behave like 
that.'

'My
 adrenaline kicked straight in and I jumped straight out of the car,' 
added Mr Cranley, of Eccles, Greater Manchester. 'I said "My fiancee and
 baby son are in the car" but they didn't care. I could see one of the 
men had something behind his back. Then he just lunged at me with the 
knife.

'Luckily I reacted 
and jumped out of the way. The knife still caught me but the blade hit 
my rib and the guys ran off. I know I was lucky that when he stabbed me 
it hit my rib. It could have been a lot worse.'

Miss Coen said: 'It really was scary. I just had 
my eye on Jake the whole time but luckily he slept through it and the 
glass from the window missed him.

'I had to go for an emergency scan the next day. I'm only 16 weeks pregnant but the stress brought about stomach pains.

'Fortunately everything is fine and we're just hoping they're caught before they do somebody serious harm.'

Lucky escape: Mr Cranley suffered a cut to his ribs after one of the thugs lunged at him with the blade but the injury could have been far worse if he hadn't jumped back

Terrifying: Mr Cranley was left with cuts to his hand, ribs and a swollen ear after the vicious attack

Police
 have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to with in connection with the attack.

Detective Constable Stu Brown of 
Greater Manchester Police said: 'What happened to this man was both 
senseless but also outrageous.

'He
 intervened like any good-natured person would when they heard these two
 thugs verbally abusing staff, and for one simple act of kindness, he 
was violently attacked by these men who were clearly lying in wait to 
exact their "revenge".

'The 
fact they were prepared to use such violence when they must have clearly
 seen a young baby in the car is absolutely despicable and thankfully, 
though clearly by chance not design, the baby was not struck by any 
shards of glass.

'What I 
want people to do is use the sense of anger they will feel reading about
 this attack and help us find the two culprits. We have issued two CCTV 
stills, which although of not great quality, will hopefully spur someone
 into coming forward with information about their identity.

'We need to find these men so please tell us if you know who they are.'
