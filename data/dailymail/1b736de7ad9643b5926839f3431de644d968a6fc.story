From its largest volcano to its deepest canyon, the extreme terrain of Mars can now be explored in unprecedented detail from the comfort of your desk.

Taking 16 years to create, this colourful map describes the geography of Mars as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet’s watery past.

It also reveals that much of the planet’s surface is older than scientists thought, with the darkest brown areas on the map formed more than four billion years ago.

The map was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Virginia using data from four separate orbiting spacecraft.

'Spacecraft exploration of Mars over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials, events and processes shaped its surface,' said USGS scientist and lead author, Dr Kenneth Tanaka.

'The new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time, providing information to generate and test new hypotheses.'

This new global geologic map of Mars depicts the most thorough representation of the red planet's surface. The map reveals that much of the planet’s surface is older than scientists thought, with the darkest brown areas on the right and left map formed more than four billion years ago

Most of the surface area of the map dates to the first major geologic time period - the Early Noachian Epoch - than was previously mapped.

This timeframe is the earliest part of the Noachian Period, which ranges from about 4.1 to about 3.7 billion years ago, and was characterised by high rates of meteorite impacts, widespread erosion of the Martian surface and the likely presence of abundant surface water.

The map also confirms previous work that suggests Mars had been geologically active until the present day.

There is evidence that major changes in Mars’ global climate supported the temporary presence of surface water and near-surface groundwater and ice.

These changes were likely responsible for many of the major shifts in the environments where Martian rocks were formed and subsequently eroded.

Low lying deposits, mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 m beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas doted around the planet

Lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red, purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described. Highland areas, generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation, are highlighted in grey and brown

Evidence
 of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 
1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons.

Viking
 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in ideas about water on 
Mars by showing how floods carved deep valleys.

Mars
 is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist 
on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have 
been warmer and wetter in the past.

In
 June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good 
enough to drink once flowed on Mars.

In September, the first scoop of 
soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface 
of the planet contain two per cent water by weight.

The light blue areas show the late Amazonian polar caps. These areas are heavily pitted by impact craters, particularly in the southern polar region.

Lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red, purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described.

Low lying deposits, mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 metres beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas dotted around the planet.

Highland areas, generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation, are highlighted in grey and brown. A full explanation of the features can be found here.

'Findings from the map will enable researchers to evaluate potential landing sites for future Mars missions that may contribute to further understanding of the planet’s history,' said USGS Acting Director Suzette Kimball.

'The new Mars global geologic map will provide geologic context for regional and local scientific investigations for many years to come.'

The Martian surface has been the subject of scientific observation since the 1600s, first by Earth-based telescopes, and later by fly-by missions and orbiting spacecraft.

The Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter missions produced the first planet-wide views of Mars’ surface, enabling publication of the first global Mars geologic maps in 1978 and 1986-87.

This latest map was created using data from the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.
