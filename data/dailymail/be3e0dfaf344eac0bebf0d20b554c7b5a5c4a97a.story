Criticism: In a statement on her website, Halifax MP Linda Riordan, pictured, said she would cease renting her £400,000 South London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie

A Labour MP exposed for pocketing £19,000 a year by renting out her taxpayer-funded second home to a colleague was shamed into ending the arrangement last night.

In a statement on her website, Halifax MP Linda Riordan said she would cease renting her £400,000 South London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie after facing a wave of criticism.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) responded to the public outcry over the issue by announcing it would review rules that allow MPs to rent their homes to other politicians.

An investigation by the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that Mrs Riordan was exploiting a loophole in the new expenses rules that allows MPs to rent out their second homes for profit while claiming thousands in expenses to rent a third home from themselves.

In her statement last night Mrs Riordan insisted she had acted within the rules and cleared the arrangement with Ipsa.

But she added: ‘I now recognise what the perception of this arrangement will look like to my constituents and the wider general public.

'I understand Ipsa is consulting on this and other issues and it is right they look at it. When the tenancy concludes I will cease this arrangement.’

At least 27 MPs are thought to be involved in the practice, including well-known names such as shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, former defence secretary Liam Fox and former defence ministers Sir Nick Harvey and Sir Peter Luff.

Four Scots MPs were included in the list of MPs – Labour’s Ian Davidson and Jim Murphy – the former Scottish Secretary – ex-Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson.

Mrs Riordan is thought to be one of 
four MPs renting out their second homes to fellow MPs. Mr McKenzie pays 
her £1,560 a month in rent – equal to £18,720 a year – which he claims 
back from the taxpayer.

Mrs
Riordan’s mortgage is thought to be about £560 a month, leaving her a 
clear profit of £1,000. At the same time, Mrs Riordan, 59, has claimed 
£1,473 a month in expenses to rent another home in London for herself. 
She also employs her partner, Stephen Roberts, as a ‘senior researcher’ 
on a salary of up to £42,000 a year.

Mr McKenzie said he had not known the flat was owned by an MP when he rented it via an agency, and said he felt uncomfortable about the arrangement.

The revelations about Mrs Riordan led to a torrent of criticism in her West Yorkshire constituency yesterday.

One local said on the website of the Halifax Courier: ‘This reminds me of Champagne Socialism: YOU have the socialism and I’ll have the Champagne.’

Ipsa said it would review the rules surrounding rentals but it insisted it could not prevent MPs who own a property in London from renting it out for profit. Commons Speaker John Bercow was accused of trying to suppress details of the matter after warning Ipsa revealing the identities of politicians’ landlords would be a ‘security risk’.
