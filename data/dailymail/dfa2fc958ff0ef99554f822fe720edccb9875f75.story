An avalanche dumped 30 feet of snow on an Alaska highway and is blocking the only road leading into the port city of Valdez.

The avalanche started on Friday and more occurred on Saturday.

The Richardson Highway leading into the city will remain closed for about a week, reports CNN.

The Anchorage Daily News reported that the avalanche slides measured between 30 and 40 feet deep, according to Jeremy Woodrow, a state Department Transportation spokesman.

Three inches of rain fell in the area Friday, a record for that day in January, said Mike Ottenweller, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Anchorage.

The rain may have caused the series of avalanches to occur.

Snow crews spent all of Saturday dropping aerial explosives in order to avoid additional slides.

However, a new avalanche slid down the north side of Keystone Canyon on Saturday, perhaps caused by the preventative blasting activities. It measured between 1,000 and 1,500 feet long and between 60 and 70 feet deep, said Woodrow.

The residents of the coastal town of about 4,000 are being urged to evacuate their homes because water is starting to accumulate behind the snow and debris left over by the massive avalanche.

NBC News reports that the water accumulation can lead to the possibility of 'very dangerous' flash floods.

'Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation, ' the National Weather Service warned in an advisory.

CNN reports that a shelter was was made in a high school and teen center for people who choose to evacuate their homes.

The town website reports that Valdez has enough fuel and food for the time being but in the case of emergency, food and fuel can be brought to the town by barge.

Valdez is a 300-mile drive from Anchorage, a large city in Alaska.

According to CBC News, an avalanche can be caused by anything that disturbs accumulated snow on the side of a mountain.

Natural factors could be precipitation (rain or additional snow), wind, rocks falling, sudden warm weather, or external factors like skiers or snowmobiles.

Valdez is a 300-mile drive from Anchorage, the capital of Alaska.
