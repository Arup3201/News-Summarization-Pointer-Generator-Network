A man who set himself on fire in Washington DC's National Mall on Friday afternoon died of his injuries last night, police said.

The man's burns were so severe that he has still not been identified, and authorities will have to use DNA and dental records to trace him.

He had poured a can of gasoline on himself in the center of the mall and then set himself on fire at about 4.20pm, as passing joggers tried to douse the flames.

The man who set himself on fire on Friday in downtown DC has been identified as John Constantino, 64, from Laurel, New Jersey

Important place: The incident occurred in full view of the U.S. Capitol

Shutdown: The Capitol is on high alert in spite of the federal shutdown after  a woman slammed her car into one of the barricades following a high-speed chase

Police said he had been conscious and breathing when he was airlifted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

Possible
 motives for the self-immolation are being investigated, but Lieutenant 
Pamela Smith said she was unaware that he carried any signs or had 
articulated a cause.

Witness
 Katy Scheflen said she saw a tripod up near the man but that she did 
not hear him say anything intelligible before he set himself on fire.

It was also unclear if the man was filming the incident.

Some reports say that two male bystanders initially tried to put the fire out using their own shirts while others put the number of Good Samaritans at closer to five or six people.

'I didn't hear a word from him,' witness Adam Stifel told CNN. 'He had already doused himself with gasoline, I saw his gas can.'

Trouble in Washington: The man who set himself on fire on the National Mall last Friday has now been identified as a 64-year-old from New Jersey

Dangerous: The motivation behind the horrifying self-immolation remains a mystery

The incident took place near the Air and Space Museum and although his motive is not known the chosen location hints that it was a demonstration.

The Mall is a national park, making it
 one of the hundreds of such sites across the country that have been 
closed as a result of the government shutdown.Â 

U.S. Park Police sources told MailOnline that the shutdown didn't play into the rescue.

Response: Emergency crews were on the scene in minutes

Commotion: The fire incident came just one day after a woman was shot and killed by police after ramming her car into a White House barricade

'There is no indication that the government shutdown impacted the way anyone responded to this. DC Fire/EMS had people on the scene in, literally, three minutes, and a helicopter transport was there minutes later,' the source told MailOnline.

'We are the lead agency in this investigation, but it will be awhile before we give out details to anyone.'

The incident comes one day after a woman was killed by police after she rammed her car into a barricade leading to the White House.
