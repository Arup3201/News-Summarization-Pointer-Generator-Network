Congress has passed a $1.1trillion spending bill, which will keep almost all of the federal government funded until September 2015.

The Senate voted 56-40 on Saturday for the long-term funding bill, the main item left on Congress' year-end agenda.

The lengthy legislation will now be sent to President Obama for his signature before it becomes law.

Resolution: Both houses of Congress have now passed the $1.1trillion spending bill which will fund the government through to September 2015

However, though the majority of the government was given funding for the next ten months, the Department of Homeland Security was only funded until February 27.

The earlier date reflects outrage by lawmakers at an executive order by President Obama which will remove the threats of deportation from millions of illegal immigrants.

Republicans will hope yo use the early deadline to force the President to roll back the new policy.

The compromise bill had faced opposition from Democratic liberals upset about the repeal of a banking regulation and Republican conservatives unhappy that it failed to challenge Obama's immigration moves.

Next step: President Obama has been passed the legislation to sign into law. It included a tighter time limit on the Department of Homeland Security, designed to put pressure on the President over his recent immigration policy
