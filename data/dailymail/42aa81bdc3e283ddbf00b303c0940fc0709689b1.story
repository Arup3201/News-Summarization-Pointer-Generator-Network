Bill Cosby may have been caught on camera committing an alleged sex assault on a young model at the Playboy mansion, a lawyer for the victim has told DailyMail.com.

In a bombshell development the lawyer claims detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department will want to search Hugh Hefner’s luxury home after it emerges that he operates a secret high-tech camera system inside the vast LA property.

This comes as three new women who allege they were victims of Bill Cosby are set to give a press conference today and actress Phylicia Rashad has claimed that accusations Cosby attacked at least 23 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, were part of an 'orchestrated plan' to ruin his TV career. Rashad played Clair Huxtable in the long-running Cosby Show.

Bill Cosby, 77, has denied the allegations made against him and has not been charged. He is scheduled to appear at the Centre in the Square in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada tonight.

Florida attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents alleged Cosby victim Chloe Goins, believes Hefner had cameras installed in all the main areas of the house as a security measure some years ago, but significantly it’s believed he also installed cameras in the guest bedrooms.

Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting 18-year-old model Goins in one of the mansion’s bedrooms six years ago during a Playboy summer party.

Goins, now 24 and living in Las Vegas, claims the comic legend spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom where he sexually assaulted her.

She told DailyMail.com how she woke up naked in a drug haze as Cosby, with his pants down at his ankles, licked her toes and groped her in a sickening assault.

Kuvin says police will want to check whether or not Cosby was unwittingly caught on one of Hefner’s cameras as he allegedly assaulted Goins.

At the very least the security cameras would have captured the moment the TV comic met Goins at the party before allegedly leading her away to a guest bedroom, a claim Cosby's lawyers deny.

Kuvin told DailyMail.com that several sources have told him about the secret camera system.

He claims that the police are fully aware of it and have ‘requested video in the past’, adding that they will search the Playboy mansion for any new footage.

Kuvin said: ‘I have uncovered, through several former Playmates, the fact there are recording devices within the mansion and in some of the bedrooms.

‘What we think is going to happen is that police will be initiating a search warrant soon on the Playboy mansion and hopefully obtaining some of that evidence because we believe that Mr Hefner saved a lot of that material.’

Kuvin said he hasn’t reached out to the LAPD with the new information because, he says, ‘they already know’.

Goins will make a full statement to police over the alleged attack and describe the chilling assault

The alleged attack on Goins happened in 2008 meaning Cosby could face a criminal prosecution since it is within the statute of limitations.

She is due to meet with LAPD detectives this month to give her statement.

Since Goins has told of her alleged assault, it also emerged that several more women who claim to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby have come forward sparking a ‘definitive open investigation’ by LAPD, a lawyer for one of the victims claimed.

The new victims claim to have been subjected to sex attacks by Cosby but have asked to remain anonymous.

DailyMail.com has spoken to former Playboy model Jill Ann Spaulding, who lived at the mansion in 2001, to verify the existence of the camera system.

She said: ‘I believe it’s true. When I first arrived at the mansion I was told by the other girls - when they told me about the house rules – they said there were cameras in most of the rooms, including the master bedroom.

‘Hefner installed the cameras to make sure he didn’t get sued, you know, to show that no one was in there unwillingly.

‘I was taken upstairs to the second floor and there was a whole room full of surveillance that I walked by.

‘It made sense, it’s a business running there.

‘The cameras were pointing inside the house not just outside.’

Spaulding, 44, wrote a book called ‘Jill Ann: Upstairs’, a shocking, behind the scenes expose of what goes on upstairs at Hefner's mansion.

Playboy Playmate Victoria Valentino – one of Cosby’s many alleged victims - also suspected that the house was rigged with cameras.

But while she didn’t know for sure she recalls a luncheon where guests were told Hef was ‘listening in’.

‘I go up to the house at least four times a year and although I’ve never seen any I have always suspected that we were on camera.

‘I remember attending a luncheon there and Hef’s son told us his dad wasn’t joining us because he was unwell.

‘But his son said Hef would be “listening in”, that’s as far as my knowledge goes, but I took that to mean the room had equipment to record what was going on.’

Valentino added that it would ‘make sense’ for Hefner to have the home wired up in case anything happened that he later needed to check.

Valentino, 71, was 19 when Playboy magazine picked her as Playmate of the Month for September 1963.

She has kept in touch with Hefner ever since and still attends regular luncheons and events at the Playboy mansion.

Kuvin now hopes Hefner has kept any historical video footage dating back to 2008.

He believes the evidence will be the breakthrough the police need to nail Cosby – now the subject of more than 25 accusations of rape and sex attacks on women.

Kuvin says he will accompany Goins to her interview with LAPD detectives.

He added: ‘Chloe is a wreck right now and we’re working with the authorities in Los Angeles to get her in to give them her story and that should be happening soon.’

Goins will make a full statement to police over the attack, a chilling sexual assault.

The allegation is the latest to hit the comedian, 77, who has seen his reputation as one of America's most significant comedy figures eviscerated in recent months.

He is now facing of dozens of allegations of rape or sexual assault – many dating back 30 or 40 years - but until now all appeared to be covered by statutes of limitation.

Goins, originally from San Diego, and a girlfriend, were introduced to Hefner and Cosby shortly after arriving at the party at the Playboy Mansion in the summer of 2008.

The then 70-year-old comedian began lavishing blonde Goins with attention.

The star then went to get her an alcoholic drink, but soon after drinking it, Goins claims she started to feel ‘foggy’ and ‘sick’ and Cosby offered to show her to a bedroom where she could rest.

The next thing the model remembers is waking up completely undressed while a half-naked Cosby licked her toes and masturbated.

Goins said she is sure Cosby had been licking her breasts and groping her body as well.

She said: 'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me.

'He wasn't on my breasts when I woke, but I could feel, you know, the saliva on them and that he'd been licking on me.

'I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated.

'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.'

Cosby quickly jumped up when she woke, pulled his pants up and left without saying anything, Goins claims.

She didn’t report it at the time as she was scared of getting into trouble or ruining her modelling career.

Goins’ complaint and the prospect the alleged attack was caught on camera will be a huge blow to aging Cosby, whose reputation is already in tatters.

Goins is the first accuser whose allegations are not covered by the statute of limitations.

Reps for Playboy didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The LAPD declined to comment.
