Not a single person has left the protest camp outside St Paul's Cathedral since a legal eviction notice was served giving them 24 hours to quit, activists said.

The City of London Corporation had told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway by 6pm last night or face High Court action.

But instead of packing up, protesters were discussing putting up Christmas decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle.

Time to leave: Bailiffs acting for the Corporation of London handed out eviction notices to the tents at the City Of London site

Bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face High Court action.

But protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared: ‘Hell, no – we won’t go!’

The notice was issued a day after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street camp in New York. But lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months.

The Corporation had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters. But policy chairman Stuart Fraser said the negotiations went ‘nowhere’.

Naomi Colvin, for Occupy London, insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘was not something we need to be remotely worried about’.

She added: ‘It could take months. We will contest it.’

Legal threat: The warning notice handed out to protesters

The Mail told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night. Even if the court action succeeds, the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents.

Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said the Human 
Rights Act would make evicting London protesters a far more complex 
affair.

Before deciding 
whether to give the go-ahead to the eviction, a judge would have to 
consider Article 10, which covers freedom of expression, and Article 11,
freedom of assembly, he said.

‘Any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is "proportionate".

‘The
protesters have in their favour that St Paul’s remains open and so 
there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the 
land.

‘The Corporation of 
London also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp, or to 
stop the protest altogether, which would be much more difficult.

‘It is likely that we could get a 
situation where, even after the removal of the tents, protests are 
allowed to continue outside St Paul’s during the day.’

He said there were likely to be 
similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in 
Parliament Square which began in May 2010 but only concluded ten months 
later in March this year.

The anti-capitalist protest at the Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy.

Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed.

The City of London Corporation halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until January if they removed some of the tents.

After a humiliating 
internal row within the church which led to two high profile 
resignations, St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action 
against the protesters.

A spokeswoman for St Paul’s said earlier this week: ‘We recognise the local authority’s statutory right to proceed with the action.

‘We
have always desired a peaceful resolution and the Canons will continue 
to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters.’
