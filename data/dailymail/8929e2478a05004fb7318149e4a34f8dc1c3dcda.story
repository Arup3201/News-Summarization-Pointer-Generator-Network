The Costa Concordia will finally be righted next week in the largest and most expensive maritime salvage operation in history.

The cost of lifting the giant cruise liner, which sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, off the sea bed, has ballooned to £500million - a figure that could rise if there are problems, organisers admitted.

Thirty-two people died when the ship, with 4,200 passengers onboard, hit rocks and ran aground off the island of Giglio after an ill-judged 'salute' to inhabitants by the ship’s captain.

Heaving work: An underwater platform has been built on which the 114,00-tonne ship will come to rest as jacks and underwater cables haul it upright

Salvage: 500 engineers and 18,000 tonnes of cement will be used to try to haul the Costa Concordia from its current resting place on its side next to Giglio Island

The enormous operation, to pull the 
ship off the reef where it capsized, is due to start at dawn on Monday, 
weather permitting, and will take 10 to 12 hours, with 500 people 
working on the project.

Huge task: The Costa Concordia cruise ship could be upright again next week, nearly two years after the liner capsized and killed at least 30 people

It will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling.

 will look for the bodies of two people, an Italian and an Indian 
unaccounted for since the disaster, as machines haul the 114,000-tonne 
ship upright and underwater cameras comb the seabed. 

Assuming seas are calm, the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an hours-long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned into scrap

Dozens of crank-like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3 metres per hour. Steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright. Tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward

An international team of 
engineers and other experts has devised no 'Plan B' if the attempt to 
right the hulking wreck goes wrong and 
the cruise liner splits apart or falls back on its side.

Assuming
 seas are calm, the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an 
hours-long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned 
into scrap.

The 
possibility that the ship might fall apart is a 'remote event', insisted Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy's Civil 
Protection agency, at a briefing to lay out logistics.

'If the
 ship doesn't turn back upright, there is no other way to try it 
again,' he said.

The reef sliced a 
70m (230ft) long gash into a side of the hull, seawater rushed 
in and the Concordia began to lean over on one side, listing so quickly 
that many lifeboats couldn't be lowered to help save the 4,200 
passengers and cruise aboard the pleasure cruise.

Many
 of Giglio's 1,500 inhabitants work or go to school on the mainland, and
 authorities will let one last ferry sail from the island at dawn 
on Monday.

But no ferries or other boats will be allowed until the effort 
is completed.

If seas are rough, or a storm looms, the ship's rotation 
will be postponed to a later day next week.

Divers have pumped 18,000 tonnes of cement into bags below the ship to support it and prevent it from breaking up.

A
 buoyancy device acting 'like a neck brace for an injured patient' will 
hold together the ship's bow, and fishing nets will catch debris as it 
rises from beneath the ship, said Nicholas Sloane, senior salvage master
 at Titan Salvage.

The 
salvage team will go through the ship cabin by cabin and hand over items 
found on board to the Italian state prosecutor, and the vessel will be 
towed away to be dismantled.

The greatest fear for environmentalists is that the ship will break up under the massive force needed to haul it upright.

The Italian Department for the Environment have also highlighted the danger of pollution as thousands of tonnes of water inside the ship pours out.

The ship’s fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day, but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain.

Arpat, the Regional Environmental Agency of Tuscany, said it ‘will provide a sampling of the water in the affected area both during the rotation and in the days to follow, in order to identify the extent, the extension and duration of pollution.’

Mr Sloane admitted that there are risks - but once the operation begins, there is no way to stop it.

‘Once you start lifting her off the reef, you have already gone beyond the point of no return,’ he said.

National Civil Protection agency head Franco Gabrielli said: 'This scale of operation has never been attempted before.

'Like all things that have never been done before, there are elements of uncertainty.'

He added: 'The theory that the wreck will break is a remote possibility.

'What’s more likely is the possibility of spills.

'Specific plans have been put in place if that happens.'

Eventually, in a secondary operation, the cruise liner will be refloated and towed away to be broken up for scrap metal.

Four Costa Concordia crew members and a Costa Cruises company official were sentenced to jail in July for their part in the accident, and the ship's captain Francesco Schettino remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship.

The captain is accused of abandoning ship before all crew and passengers had been rescued.

A coastguard's angry phone order to him - 'Get back on board, damn it!' - became a catchphrase in Italy after the accident.

Pulleys, rotation and steel chains: The art of parbuckling

A 500-member salvage team from 24 nations will be conducting the operation to move the ship, known in nautical terms as parbuckling, before the autumn storm season arrives, when winds and powerful waves risk battering it to the point it won't hold together.

Dozens of crank-like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3metres per hour.

Steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright. Tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward.

Although parbuckling is a tested way to set upright capsized vessels, the operation has never been applied to a huge cruise liner.

The ship's fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day, but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain

Mr Sloane said the Concordia will suffer an 'extreme amount of force' of compression in the first part of the manoeuvre.

He is 'pretty satisfied' the vessel will survive the stress, adding: 'We expect her to come up to vertical'.

'She's resting in pristine waters on this hill' of two massive pieces of sloping granite seabed, Sloane said.

Tension: Observers will hold their breath during the difficult and never-before-tried operation to salvage the Costa Concordia is attempted

He likened the ship's hull bottom to a 'big belly... about the size of a football field' perched on the two reefs.

Months ago, divers inserted cement-filled bags and grouting between the reefs to provide more stability. The aim of the parbuckling is to set the wreck upright on an underwater platform that has been installed.

'The objective is to get her to move very slowly and gently,' Sloane said.

Engineers indicated they would be anxiously watching the early parts of the effort. Once the ship moves upward some 25 degrees, Sloane said: 'At that point, gravity takes over, and at that point, we start feeling relief.'
