He has ambitions to follow in the footsteps of his famously clean-cut father, BBC football pundit Gary Lineker.

But after being caught drunk behind the wheel while going for a 5am McDonald’s, 20-year-old Harry Lineker appears to have scored an own goal.

The former public schoolboy made a grovelling apology yesterday after police saw him driving erratically and found he was over the legal alcohol limit.

Looking for work: Harry Lineker told the court he hoped to get a job at the BBC in football. His father earns £1.5million a year presenting Match of the Day

Harry, who defended himself in court, was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pay £635 in fines and costs after admitting his guilt.

In court he wore a dark suit, but as he arrived and left he also wore a back-to-front baseball cap over his long hair. On his way in he also smoked a cigarette.

The resemblance to his father was clear as he arrived at court with his mother Michelle Cockayne, 48, his father’s first wife, who had to cover her head with her coat when they were caught in a rain shower.

Harry – who describes himself on his Facebook page as an ‘international man of leisure’ since leaving £34,000-a-year Charterhouse School – is the second of the couple’s four sons. His father, who retired from football in 1994 with 80 England caps, is in Brazil hosting the BBC’s World Cup coverage.

Harry has enjoyed some of the benefits of Gary’s celebrity status, appearing at movie premieres and joining his older brother George at West End nightclubs.

Speaking about his lifestyle, Harry told the court he did not go to university and has been unemployed for two years but said he wants to ‘get a job in TV sport’.

He said he would like to do ‘anything in sport. I’m looking for different experiences, try out and see what I’m doing from that.

‘I want to try and get a job at the BBC, in journalism, anything like that – preferably football and other sports as well.’

‘I live with my mum,’ he said. ‘I don’t get an allowance, I live at home and if I go out I get some money.’

He said his mother would pay the fine and his court costs within seven days. Asked if he had anything else to say, he replied: ‘That I’m really sorry, I thought I was fine and I apologise.’ He was arrested after police spotted his silver VW Polo clipping a roundabout in Wandsworth, south west London, at 5.20am on April 12.

Darren Wabbs, prosecuting, told Hammersmith magistrates: ‘He was seen by officers driving in an erratic fashion. The vehicle was seen swerving across the road, stopping half way down and performing a turn in the road.

Officers followed it for a distance, the driver wandered slightly over the white line along the road and caught the corner of the roundabout.’ Harry was pulled over and failed a roadside breath test. A further blood test at a police station revealed he had 86mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood. The legal limit is 80ml.

Out of work: Lineker told the court he lived with his mother, and apologised for driving while over the limit

Harry told the court he had had a few drinks in the evening and thought he was able to drive legally.

He said: ‘I had three pints with friends the night before, went back to the house and watched videos. About three hours later I went down the road to get some food from McDonald’s on Wandsworth roundabout. I thought I was fine.’

District Judge Devinder Sandhu fined him £500 with £85 costs and a £50 victim surcharge.

She said: ‘This was incredibly foolish. It’s all too clear the consequences of when people like you drink drive.

‘You were lucky there was not an accident that day and equally lucky that nobody else was injured from your driving.’

Gary Lineker, 53, has three other sons, George, 22, Tobias, 18, and Angus, 16. He split from their mother in 2006 and married model Danielle Bux in September 2009.

The TV presenter advertises Walkers crisps alongside his media career and is estimated to have a £30million fortune.

Earlier this year he said he keeps tabs on his two eldest sons’ driving with electronic ‘black box’ recorders he had fitted to their vehicles.

‘Every now and again I will suddenly see something where they are driving too fast or they are braking too sharply,’ he said.
