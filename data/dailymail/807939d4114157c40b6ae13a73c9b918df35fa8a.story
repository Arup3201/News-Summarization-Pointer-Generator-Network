The Queen's former press secretary is set to expose secrets about Prince Charles' marriage to Diana in a new book. 

Royal Press Officer for 12 years, it is believed Dickie Arbiter's memoirs will also detail the breakdown of two other royal marriages, and concerns over the behaviour of Jimmy Savile when he visited Prince Charles at St James’s Palace.

The Prince is said to be 'furious' at what he sees as a betrayal by a friend, it has been reported.

Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to The Queen (pictured with his daughter Victoria) is set to expose secrets about Prince Charles' marriage to Diana in a new book

The Sunday Mirror reports that a palace source revealed: 'Charles is furious. This man was a trusted friend.'

The
 book - On Duty with the Queen, published by Blink Publishing - promises
 to share what life was like 'behind the scenes' during the time that Mr
 Arbiter worked at the Palace in 'the most turbulent period in the history of the modern British monarchy'.

It was previously reported that Mr Arbiter, a respected royal pundit around the world, had turned down countless previous offers to write his memoirs.

Mr Arbiter worked at the palace between 1988 and 2000. He witnessed the breakdown of Prince Charles' marriage to Diana and the affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles.

He was also working for the palace the day Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris.

The palace source told the paper: 'It is just a case of a man who he 
thought was a friend and who could be trusted cashing in on the misery 
of that time. It is disloyal.'

Born during the Blitz, Arbiter moved 
as a teenager to the former Rhodesia, where he trained as an 
electrician. He worked in theatre and then broadcasting with LBC, the 
London news radio network, in the Seventies, covering the Queen’s Silver
 Jubilee. He was then invited to join the palace staff, in 1988.

It is also said to reveal that Jimmy Savile's behaviour at St James's Palace was a cause for 'concern and suspicion'

He has previously said the book 'is not a kiss-and-tell but an 
autobiography'.

He said: ‘It’s a candid look behind some of the 
most salacious and sensational royal stories of those days from the 
perspective of someone who was not only there, but who also had 
experience of the monarchy.’

It is also said to reveal that Savile’s behaviour at St James’s Palace was a cause for 'concern and suspicion'.

The Mail has previously reported Mr Arbiter's account that Savile would run his lips up the arms of young female assistants in a 'suspicious' display of affection while visiting Prince Charles 

Mr Arbiter said: 'He would walk into the office and do the rounds of the young ladies taking their hands and rubbing his lips all the way up their arms if they were wearing short sleeves.

'If it was summer [and their arms were bare] his bottom lip would curl out and he would run it up their arms.'

A Palace spokesman told the MailOnline: 'We wouldn’t comment on the contractual obligations of employees, past or present, of the Royal Household.'
