The Obama administration has forcefully denied that it is quietly exploring the possibility of a presidential visit to Iran in 2014, despite weekend news reports that originated with a newspaper in Kuwait.

The White House quickly pooh-poohed the idea late Monday morning, with National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden telling MailOnline in an email that 'there's no truth to this report.'

'I'll leave it to others to speculate on how rumors get started,' she said.

She also declined to speculate on whether the White House might accept an offer to visit Tehran if the initial news report were a trial balloon to gauge the administration's likely response.

'Iâ€™m not ... going to comment on hypothetical situations,' Hayden added.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani (C) got a hero's welcome when he returned home from the U.S. in September, with demonstrators chanting 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' -- and 'Thank you Rouhani'

Obama's last public statements on Iran came during a late-night Nov. 23 announcement of the terms of a nuclear deal with the Islamic republic. Iran later claimed the White House fabricated some of the details it released

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden (L) was quick to dismiss any idea of Obama visiting Iran, which is still trying to shake its image as the state sponsor of a 444-day hostage crisis in the late 1970s

A
senior national security staffer who served in a Republican 
administration told MailOnline that it would be an 'intensely foolish' 
move for the Obama team.

'The
only way he goes to Tehran is if he doesn't plan on coming back,' said 
the former White House expert, who requested anonymity.

'Whatever people may think about the current occupant of the White House, I can't believe this possibility would ever be on the table.'

The Arabic-language Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida reported on Friday that Obama 'is trying to arrange a visit to Tehran in the middle of next year.'

'The source said his desire for the visit is mutual,' the report read, according to an English translation obtained by MailOnline, 'and that both Tehran and Washington expect Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to invite his American counterpart to visit Tehran as soon as certain arrangements are concluded.'

The Obama administration's 
relationship with Iran has evolved in recent weeks, following that 
nation's preliminary agreement to trim back some portions of its nuclear
program in exchange for a relaxation of economic sanctions.

The Kuwaiti news outlet Al-Jarida cited an unnamed diplomatic source and reported that Obama is set to visit Iran next year

How would he explain it to Bibi? Obama's frosty relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be frayed to the breaking point if the White House were to green-light a friendly visit to Tehran

But while Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif mugged for cameras last month in Geneva and promised greater transparency, both Rouhani and Khamenei fed Iranians a steady diet of hard-line rhetoric.

And Iranian leaders slammed the Obama White House last week for publishing what it termed a 'one-sided interpretation' of the agreement, later disagreeing with the White House's claim that it would forgo its 'absolute' right to enrich uranium.

Iran also said last week that its controversial heavy-water reactor project would continue, a sign that it is developing a plutonium reactor most likely intended for producing weapons-grade nuclear material.

The Al-Jarida report first surfaced on a blog published by The Weekly Standard.

The confusion over Washington's relationship with Tehran comes as Iran has acknowledged that it will build a second nuclear reactor, which it claims is for peaceful purposes.

The state-run FARS News Agency reported Sunday that a new facility would be built in the same province where it already has a function reactor, which Russia helps operate.

The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida published a report Friday, in Arabic, claiming that President Obama was planning a visit to Iran. Here is a translation provided to MailOnline by a fluent Arabic speaker:

Al-Jarida has learned from a U.S. diplomat that President Barack Obama is trying to arrange a visit to Tehran in the middle of next year.

The source said his desire for the visit is mutual, and that both Tehran and Washington expect Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to invite his American counterpart to visit Tehran as soon as certain arrangements are concluded.

He [the source] pointed out that the most significant detail remaining to be decided is whether there will be a meeting between Obama and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, or whether that meeting won't be held.

The source said Obama was expecting the invitation, and planned to devote the trip to publicizing his administration's policy in the region, which is based on the principles of non-military involvement and harmony.

He wants to be the first U.S. president to visit Iran since the Khomeini revolution, and to demonstrate that he is a champion of peaceful discussions, even with those who chant 'death to America.'
