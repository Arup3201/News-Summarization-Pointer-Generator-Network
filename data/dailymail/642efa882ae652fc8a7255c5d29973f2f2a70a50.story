Perched on railing with a can of lager in one hand and a cigarette in the other, this mother is hardly setting a shining example to children filing out of a nearby primary school.

The unnamed woman must have found the stress of the 3pm school run too hard to take as she swigged from the can while waiting opposite a man with a pram for her own child to come out of the school gates.

The feckless mother was photographed by a furious fellow parent, also waiting outside Macaulay Primary Academy, in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire.

Bad example: A woman was spotted drinking from a can of lager outside a primary school in Grimsby, north east Lincolnshire. She is thought to be a parent waiting to pick her child up

He said: 'Children being exposed to this kind of behaviour will start to believe it is acceptable if something isn't done to stop this in the future.

'Isn't it an offence to drink in public at this time?'

The photograph also drew the condemnation of the school's headteacher Julie Saunders who said she has since spoken to the parents involved.

She said: 'Clearly this is not the sort of thing we want to see outside the school; it is not a good example. It is the first time this has happened. I have spoken to the parents about it and have had a positive response.

'If there are any more reports like this, I shall be speaking to the PCSOs for the area.'

Mrs Saunders highlighted the rules for parents dropping off and collecting children from the school, adding: 'I do not allow smoking on our site and I have a code of conduct for parents because they come into the school.

'There is a level of behaviour which is not accepted. We do not allow smoking and there is no shouting or swearing or physical abuse and parents are not allowed to come in under the influence of drink or drugs.'

North East Lincolnshire Councillor Ian Lindley, said that the mother's behaviour sends out the wrong kind of message to children at the school.

He said: 'We donâ€™t like to dictate to parents about smoking and drinking, but they have to be reasonable where they do it.

'We are always trying to promote healthy lifestyles, particularly with children.

'Drinking in public, which we see a lot of on the West Marsh, is a difficult issue.

'All we can do is try to discourage people because it sends out the wrong message to young people that it is somehow socially acceptable.'

The woman was pictured as the Association of Police Chiefs launched a campaign against drinking in public and related antisocial behaviour.

The organisation says that 50 per cent of all violent crime is alcohol related, with half of domestic violence incidents and around a third of child abuse cases involving offenders who are under the influence of alcohol.

As part of the nationwide campaign, Grimsby police officers will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the photo taken outside Macaulay Primary Academy and intend to name and shame those who drink irresponsibly in the town.

Police and Crime Commissioner for Humberside, Matthew Grove, said: 'The clear message has to be that those who drink too much need to take responsibility for their own actions and this is something I will be working to address.

'In the cold light of day, many of the people I have seen behaving badly because of drink should feel embarrassed by their actions, and we must find ways to ensure the embarrassment lasts longer than the hangover.'
