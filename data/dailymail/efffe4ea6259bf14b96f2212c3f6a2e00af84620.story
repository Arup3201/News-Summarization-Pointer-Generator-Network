Holyoak arrived for her sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court today wearing headphones

A middle-aged reggae lover who blasted her music louder than a nearby motorway has narrowly avoided jail.

Chrissie Holyoak, 54, made her neighbours’ lives a living hell by blaring James Brown, Barry White and reggae music through speakers at her home in Buckhurst Hill, Essex.

The former bus driver - who describes music as her ‘therapy’ and wore headphones to court - was handed a 10-week suspended prison sentence when she appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court today.

She had faced up to five years in prison for the offence.

Holyoak was slapped with an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) last July after annoying her neighbours with her loud music.

A
 jury took just 27 minutes to find her guilty of six breaches of the 
ASBO in June this year following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court.

The
 trial had heard Holyoak blasted out a selection of reggae tunes, as 
well as Barry White and James Brown, on speakers throughout the day and 
night.

An
 environmental health officer for Epping Council said the music could be
 clearly heard over the sound of the neighbouring M11 motorway.

Recorder Timothy Ashe QC said there was a 'complete failure' to obey the law.

'Your behaviour has been quite extraordinary.

'The element that makes this very serious is the total flouting of noise abatement notices and anti-social behaviour orders.

'You have narrowly got away with prison.

'I do warn you that you will end up in prison if you continue to do this.'

Holyoak came to court today wearing a large pair of red and black iDance headphones and only removed them once in the dock for sentencing.

Recorder Ashe QC sentenced her to 10-weeks imprisonment, suspended for one year, and ordered her to pay £180 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Speaking outside of court, she said: 'I can’t believe I’m 54 and I’m looking at going away for playing music.

'Music is my therapy. It’s what I eat, it’s what I breathe.

'I don’t do drugs, I don’t drink - that is why I have music.

'I’ve
 stuck to what they told me and used my headphones 24 hours a day. All 
these complaints are just lies so they have an excuse to kick me out of 
my house.'

The traffic on the M11 near Essex is loud but the music being played at Holyoak's home drowned it out

A Chelsmford Crown Court jury took only 27 minutes to find Holyoak guilty of six breaches of the ASBO

Tom Carne, speaking for Epping Forest District Council, said: 'We obviously take breaches of ASBOs and noise nuisances very seriously.

'Loud music played for hours on end can be very distressing to neighbours.

'We don't like to take people to court and we always try more gentle persuasion first but if they continue to ignore council requests and flout sanctions placed on them, as in this case, we will prosecute and take every action through the courts available to us.

'We are very pleased with the outcome of today's hearing and hope it sends a message to others who would ignore the basic rules of being a good neighbour.'
