Suspect: Ammar Harris, pictured, whose previous arrests include kidnapping, sexual assault and soliciting clients for a prostitute, has been identified as a suspect in the terrifying Las Vegas shooting

Police are searching for a 26-year-old heavily-tattooed alleged pimp they believe was responsible for a deadly Las Vegas Strip shooting on Thursday, as they unearthed the black Range Rover SUV involved in the incident.

Ammar Harris was today identified as a suspect in the 
terrifying shooting that killed an aspiring rapper and caused a fiery crash 
that left two other people dead and five more injured.

Harris, whose previous arrests in the city include kidnapping, sexual assault and soliciting clients for a prostitute, is considered armed and dangerous, police Capt. Chris Jones said.

'His location is unknown,' police Capt. 
Chris Jones said today of Harris, adding that he said sometimes goes by 
the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris.

The suspect allegedly opened fire on Kenneth Cherry Jr, an amateur rapper, who was driving a dark grey Maserati on the neon-lit boulevard near the Bellagio and Caesars Palace at around 4:20 a.m. on Thursday.

The shooting caused a six-vehicle chain reaction wreck before dawn, killing taxi driver Michael Boldon and passenger Sandra Sutton-Wasmund of Washington in a fiery blaze.

In a photo released by police, Harris has tattoos on his right cheek and words in script on his neck above an image appearing to depict an owl with blackened eyes.

The Range Rover with blackout windows and distinctive black rims was located at an apartment complex just a couple of blocks east of the Strip. Jones said it was impounded as evidence and towed away.

Cherry, aka Kenny Clutch, had once bragged about stashing a gun in his $120,000 Italian sports car, it was revealed on Friday.

The 27-year-old was killed when Harris allegedly opened fire on his car from inside their Range Rover while Cherry was sitting at a red light. He accelerated into the intersection and crashed into Boldon's taxi.

Boldon and his passenger died when the taxi burst into flames. Boldon, 62, was a family man who moved from Michigan to Las Vegas  to take care of his ailing mother. Sutton-Wasmund, 48, was a businesswoman and mother of three.

A passenger in the Maserati was wounded 
in the arm and four people from four other vehicles were treated for 
non-life-threatening injuries. The Maserati passenger was cooperating 
with investigators. His name hasn't been made public.

Police say the shooting appeared to stem
 from an argument at the valet area of the upscale Aria resort-casino 
about a block south of the crash scene.

The shooting happened after a 
night featuring Morocco-born rapper French Montana at Aria nightclub 
Haze.

The shocking chain of events had family 
members and friends in Las Vegas, California, Michigan and Washington 
trying to grasp the blink-of-an-eye finality of it all.

'My son was a good boy,' Kenneth 
Cherry Sr. told reporters Saturday in a news conference convened by Las 
Vegas lawyers Vicki Greco and Robert Beckett.

Beckett said they wanted to respond to rumors that their son was a gangster and a troublemaker.

The attorneys had represented his son, and now represent his estate and the family.

'My son was a victim just like the 
two people in that taxi,' Kenneth Cherry Sr. said. 'Trouble found him. 
The people in the taxicab, trouble found them.'

Court records show Cherry had no criminal cases or convictions in Las Vegas, and police said there was no record of arrests.

The Clark County coroner determined 
that Kenny Cherry died of at least one gunshot to the chest. Boldon and 
Sutton-Wasmund died of injuries in the crash. All three deaths were 
ruled homicides.

Despite initial reports that the chaos on the Strip was the result of a gunfight, authorities are now saying neither Cherry nor his passenger fired any shots and that the attack was a drive-by shooting.

The shooting took place just two blocks 
from the spot where rapper Tupac Shakur was infamously gunned down in a 
drive-by shooting in 1996 on the Las Vegas Strip.

Cherry was only beginning his rap career when he was killed.

He posted two videos on YouTube last year and each had gained only a few thousand views.

In 'Stay Schemin,' he rapped about hiding a pistol in his Maserati. Police have no said whether Cherry was armed the night of the shooting.

'Maserati. Paid 120 for it. Stash box 'cuz you know I got that semi for it,' he sings.

The gunfire broke about about 4:20am PST when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the vehicle, according to police.

Cherry's Maserati sped through the intersection and crashing into a taxi cab, which burst into flames.

One witness said it was like a scene out of 'Die Hard.'

Authorities are trying to track down
 Harris who remains at large after fleeing the scene.

In
 a press conference on Friday, Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan 
said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described, 
saying that the cars were all stopped at a red light.

Sgt. Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection where the shooting occurred on Thursday.

'We have a lot of pieces to put together to establish a timeline as to why this confrontation occurred,' he said.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the high-speed gun battle could have started as a dispute at a nearby casino.

LVMPD officials were searching for the gunman and the high-end SUV after it fled the scene of the deadly accident.

Three other vehicles were involved in
 the wreck, but Sgt John Sheahan said the SUV was gone before police arrived.

Tourists staying in high-rise hotels around the scene found police tape blocking access to the area around the intersection.

Closures lasted most of the day, snarling traffic in the highly-popular tourist corridor.

British
 tourist Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester said that the 
scene was something straight out of an action movie.

'This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,' he said.

'We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like "Die Hard" or something.'

A tourist who witnessed the aftermath of the crash told KLAS-TV the burning taxi looked like a fireball.

'There was a loud bang, and I hear two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace...and could see the fireball,' he told the CNN affiliate.

The intersection is surrounded by some of the most famous casinos on the Strip, including the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, and Bally's, and is a popular area for tourists.

A spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Jeremy Handel, issued a statement reassuring people that much is being done to keep them safe.

'Recent incidents, while unfortunate, were isolated events,' he said. 'Las Vegas is among the safest travel destinations in the world and utilizes the most advanced technology and training to maintain a secure environment.

The shooting is the latest in a series of violent actions on the tourist corridor since the beginning of the year.

Two people were critically wounded in
 a shooting at a parking garage February 6, and a tourist was stabbed in
 an elevator at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay February 16.
