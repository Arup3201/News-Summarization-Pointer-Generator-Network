David Cameron today hailed Nelson Mandela as a ‘towering figure’ as Parliament cleared its agenda for eight hours of tributes to the former South African president.

But the Prime Minister’s moving homage to Mr Mandela’s ‘enduring place in history’ risked being undermined when he tweeted during the opening speeches.

Just minutes after the Commons session began, Mr Cameron’s official account released a picture of himself, with ITV’s Little Ant and Dec admiring a reindeer.

Tributes: Prime Minister David Cameron hailed Nelson Mandela as a 'towering figure' as he gave the first of eight hours of speeches in the Commons

Gaffe: As Labour leader Ed Miliband began his tribute to Mr Mandela, Mr Cameron's Twitter account posted this picture of a reindeer

Addressing a packed House of Commons, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘Nelson Mandela was a towering figure in our lifetime - a pivotal figure in the history of South Africa and the world - and it is right that we meet in this Parliament to pay tribute to his character, his achievements and his legacy.’

It is the first time that MPs have met since Mr Mandela’s death was announced on Thursday night.

In the first speech of the day, Mr Cameron said: ‘When looking back over history, it can be easy to see victories over prejudice and hatred as somehow inevitable.

‘As the years lengthen and events recede, it can seem as though a natural tide of progress continually bears humanity ever upwards away from brutality and darkness and towards something better.

‘But is not so. Progress is not just handed down as a gift, it is won through struggle: …the struggle of men and women who believe things can be better, who refuse to accept the world as it is, but dream of what it can be. 

‘Nelson Mandela was the embodiment of that struggle.  He did not see himself as a helpless victim of history, he wrote it.’

Mr Cameron recalled meeting Mr Mandela when Tory opposition leader in 2008 on a visit to London

Preparations: Work continues on a massive arena on the property of former South African President Nelson Mandela ahead of his state burial service on Sunday, in Qunu

A giant arena is being built in view of Nelson Mandela's home to stage the biggest funeral in South Africa's history for him.

Final
preparations are being made before more than 70 world leaders fly in 
this week to attend a series of events to mark the extraordinary life of
one of humanity's great peacemakers.

They include Cuban
leader Raul Castro and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe who could rub shoulders
with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles in an 
unprecedented gathering.

Among the mourners heading to South Africa this week will be figures from the worlds of music, business and fashion.

Tycoon Sir Richard Branson, supermodel Naomi Campbell and musicians Bono, Annie Lennox and Peter Gabriel are expected at the memorial service on Tuesday.

Sir Richard and singer Peter 
Gabriel devised 'The Elders' forum of statesmen and activists set 
up by Mr Mandela.

U2 singer and activist Bono, 53, said the anti-apartheid icon had inspired him to campaign against Aids and world poverty.

Miss
Campbell, 43, who Mr Mandela described as his 'honorary granddaughter',
has helped raise money for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and his 
former political party the African National Congress.

Grammy-award winning artist Annie Lennox, 58, has a long association with Mr Mandela after performing at his 70th birthday concert in 1988.

Three previous prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - are to join current PM David Cameron at the official memorial ceremony.

Also attending the national memorial service in Johannesburg’s FNB Stadium will be Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband, said Downing Street.

It
is thought to be the first time for many years that all of the UK’s 
surviving prime ministers have travelled to an event abroad, and 
reflects the deep respect in which Mr Mandela is held within British 
politics.

Among those expected to be there are U.S. President Barack Obama and United Nations secretary -general Ban Ki-moon.

Former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter will also be there.

At the funeral, political guests will include Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout – who is representing his country in place of its prime minister Jiri Rusnok.

Mr Rusnok was forced to apologise after he was recorded saying: 'The idea of going gives me the shivers.'

Today,
South Africa's government released the list of speakers for the Tuesday
memorial, expected to last four hours at stadium at Soweto Township 
near Johannesburg.

Beyond Obama and Ban, the government says the following leaders will speak:

- Brazil President Dilma Rousseff; - Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao; - Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba; - Indian President Pranab Mukherjee; and - Cuban President Raul Castro.

South
African President Jacob Zuma will give the keynote address. Mr 
Mandela's family and friends also will speak at the ceremony, which will
include a sermon.

But moments later the Twitter account @David_Cameron posted a message saying: ‘With Little Ant & Little Dec ahead of a tough #TextSanta interview. You can see it on Dec 20 @ITVTextSanta.’

Little Ant and Dec are junior look-a-likes of ITV stars Ant and Dec, who are seen interviewing celebrities as part of Saturday Night Takeaway. Text Santa is an ITV festive charity fundraiser.

The inappropriate time of the post was immediately spotted by Twitter users.

Friends of the Eart campaigner Oliver Hayes said: ‘Odd thing to tweet while listening to @Ed_Miliband paying tribute to Mandela.’

Mr Miliband told the Commons Mr Mandela can truly call himself the father of a nation.

Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg also addressed the Commons during the tributes

Several MPs referred to the Nelson Mandela statue which looks across Parliament Square towards the House of Parliament, which has become a focus for floral tributes

The Labour leader reflected that Mr 
Mandela himself said he was no saint, but a sinner who kept on trying, 
and said he left a fight against injustice which must continue in 
Britain and around the world.

And
he said: ‘It is in the spirit of what Nelson Mandela taught us to 
acknowledge the truth about the past, and without rancour to welcome the
change that has come to pass.

‘But
also to honour his legacy, by acknowledging in every country, including
our own, the battle against racial injustice still needs to be won.'

Ex-prime minister Gordon Brown made a rare appearance in the Commons today to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela.

The Labour MP, who has spoken just six times since losing power in 2010, said Mr Mandela who taught the world that 'no injustice can last forever'.

Mr Brown, who was the first MP to speak after the three main party leaders, paid homage to the man he described as being as great 'as the continent he loved'.

Recalling that he unveiled a statue of Mr Mandela before the former ANC president, Mr Brown described the monument with its hands outstretched, 'but his finger pointing upwards, as it always did, to the heights: the man most responsible for the destruction of what people thought was indestructible, the apartheid system.

'The man that taught us no injustice can last forever.'

Mr Miliband added: 'So we come here to honour the man, to acknowledge our history and also for one final reason: to recognise and uphold the universal value for which Nelson Mandela stood, the dignity of every person whatever their colour or creed, values of tolerance and respect for all, and justice for all people wherever they may live and whatever oppression they may face.

‘His extraordinary life calls on us all to keep on trying, for nobler ideals, for higher purposes, and for a bigger and not a smaller politics, inspired by his example and the movement he lead.

‘We mourn his loss, we give thanks for his life and we honour his legacy.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Mandela's upholding of the principles of truth and reconciliation after being released from prison and becoming South Africa's first black president laid down a blueprint for other societies ridden with conflict and division to follow.

He said Northern Ireland had learnt lessons from the anti-apartheid hero and called on Sri Lanka to follow his example to bring the country peace and unity after decades of civil war.

Mr Clegg said: 'Given the enormity of his achievements we're all struggling to work out the best way to honour his legacy.

'I like to think that one of the things he would like us to do in this House today is to pay tribute to and support the individuals and the organisations around the world that fight for human rights and do not have a global name.

'Right now all over the world there are millions of men, women and children still struggling to overcome poverty, violence, discrimination.

'They do not have the fame or the standing of Nelson Mandela but I'm sure that he would tell us that what they achieve and endure in their pursuit of a more open, equal and just society shapes all our lives.'
