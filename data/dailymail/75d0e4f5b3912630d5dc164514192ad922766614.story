Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers will not be allowed to torture terrorism suspects, under new laws.

The federal government says ASIO has never been involved in the technique but will ensure that tough new counter-terrorism laws explicitly prohibit torture by intelligence officers.

Labor and a number of Senate crossbenchers have been critical that one part of a bill to give ASIO extra powers could allow the use of torture, under some circumstances.

Attorney-General George Brandis says there is no need to legislate against torture because ASIO had never engaged in the practice but 'explicit prohibition' will still be included in the new anti-terror laws to be introduced into parliament 

In fact, crossbench Senators  David Leyonhjelm (Liberal Democratic Party) and Bob Day (Family First Party) threatened to withdraw their support for the Abbott Government because of the laws.

Senator Leyonhjelm claimed they would allow ASIO officers to resort to torture techniques.

The prohibition on torture is supported by new ASIO chief Duncan Lewis.

"The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has never practised torture, it does not practise torture and it never will," he said.

Senator Brandis stated that the move to outlaw torture did not require legislation because ASIO had never engaged in that practice.

Restrictions already are in place but the specific reference should 'clear up debate on the matter'.

'I want to stress that there is absolutely no necessary legal reason to do this,' Senator Brandis said.

But he wanted to avoid the debate being diverted by an issue that 'is nothing but a red herring'.

'The Australian Government has never and will not support torture.'

He added that the decision heeded strong views put forward by Muslim leaders.

ASIO officers, however, should remain protected from legal liability if they have to 'play along' with planning a terrorist act, for example.

A planned law allowing the foreign minister to declare certain overseas areas no-go zones to Australians will also be subject to a 10-year sunset clause.

Senator Brandis said he had also agreed to put in place the sunset clauses, kicking in from 2025, for a range of police anti-terrorism powers including control and preventative detention orders.

A second tranche of laws to be introduced to parliament on Wednesday would allow the foreign minister to declare certain overseas terrorist hotspots are no-go zones.

Anyone travelling to those designated regions could face jail unless they have a valid reason for visiting the areas.

The individual zone declarations will be presented to parliament not as legislation, rather as regulations, known as legislative instruments.

The foreign fighters legislation will also have a sunset clause of 2025, after which time it will be reviewed.

The bill to give ASIO extra powers was slated to be debated in the Senate today (Monday) but has been put off until Tuesday to allow the Labor shadow cabinet and caucus to consider it in detail.

The Attorney-General defended the raids in Sydney and Brisbane last week, involving more than 800 police officers, which resulted in one man being arrested and charged with a terrorism-related offence

Senator Brandis said it would be a mistake to say the joint operation across two capital cities last week was not justified, insisting it had been necessary to act to prevent the public from imminent harm
