A Briton accused of beating his girlfriend to death in Crete today tearfully declared he wants to visit her grave to 'say goodbye to the love of my life'.

Luke Walker has returned to the UK on bail and spoke for the first time since being arrested on suspicion of murdering 20-year-old Chelsea Hyndman on the Greek holiday island in 2010.

In an interview at his family home he also claimed he was at Chelsea’s bedside when she died and told her: 'I love you, I will wait here for you and I will see you in a bit.'

Court case: Luke Walker, left, at home in Brierley Hill, West Midlands after returning from Crete. He says he wants to visit the grave of former girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, right, who he is accused of murdering

Accused: Luke with father Patrick. Walker came back from the Greek island yesterday and went to a local carvery for the evening

Chelsea had been working at the party resort of Malia when she died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen.

Greek prosecutors claim she was beaten by Walker, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, but he claims she fell during a night out in Malia and actually died 10 days later from septicaemia.

Speaking for the first time since he was granted bail following a judges’ strike in Crete, Luke said he wanted to say his final goodbye to the ‘love of his life’ Chelsea.

He also claimed Greek doctors originally told him Chelsea, from Castleford, West Yorkshire just had food poisoning and was not seriously ill.

'I was at work on the night, I didn’t know about the fall and I was just told it happened afterwards.

'She came home that night but a couple of days later she fell ill with stomach pains and I took her back to hospital.

'Chelsea was in agony and it was hard to get much sense from the doctors as they didn’t speak English but they did tell me they thought it was food poisoning.

Place in the sun: Ms Hyndman's family have said in the past no verdict could ever bring her daughter back and are distraught at her death

'She was in hospital for a few days but 10 days after I took her in, she suddenly died.

'As she was going down to the operating theatre I held her hand and said to her ‘keep fighting, I love you, I will wait here for you, don’t worry I will see you in a bit.

'But she never regained consciousness.

'Now I just want to go and see her grave and visit the memorial garden that was planted in memory - I have not been able to say goodbye and grieve properly. I really need to go and do that.

'To be accused of murdering her is heart-wrenching. She was my everything, I would have married her.'

After her death, Walker was arrested by police and charged with murder.

He spent five months in a Greek prison but was released on bail on the conditions he must stay on the island until his trial.

But last week his trial was halted because judges in Greece went on strike and key prosecution and defence witnesses were not available.

He returned back to the UK on Tuesday evening where he revealed the first thing he did was go to the pub for a carvery with his family.

'I never thought I would enjoy this weather so much. It’s been strangely nice to see double decker buses and all the grey buildings around the Black Country,' he said.

'I went straight to the pub for a carvery with my nan, brother-in-law and cousin. A British roast dinner never tasted so good. To be back in my own bed was incredible - it’s the first time I’ve slept all night in two and a half years.

'I’m happy to be back but it’s not a celebration, I still have a trial to go through and I still want to clear my name. If I get a court summons back there tomorrow I will be on the first plane out.

'It’s not a country I’ve enjoyed being obviously. Greek prisons are absolute hell and even when I was out I just kept my head down. I didn’t have many friends out there but people came out to see me when they could.

'The support has been overwhelming - and I’m happy to be home for now. There’s still a long way to go.'
