Prince Carl Philip of Sweden was assaulted in an unprovoked attack as he left a nightclub in Cannes in the early hours of Saturday.

The 33-year-old prince had been partying with a group of friends and his girlfriend, former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist, at celebrity haunt Baoli when three men jumped on him as as they left the club at 3am.

A witness filmed the incident on a mobile phone and posted a video online showing the prince being grabbed by the neck before receiving a blow to the back of his head.

Playboy: Prince Carl Philip has been branded a rebel since he split from his partner of ten years and instead began seeing Miss Hellqvist, an ex-glamour model and reality television star in 2010

The incident is the latest event of 
what has been called the playboy prince's 'Wild Summer' which has seen 
him hit the Swedish party scene wearing an alien mask, lose his Gucci 
wallet and hitch hike on his way to a motoring competition where he 
crashed his car in the first race.

The shaky video from Saturday morning show the prince keeling over after being hit and Sofia and 
their friends get involved in the brawl.

Sofia was reportedly hit multiple
times as she tried to separate the prince and the attackers who were unknown to the royal couple.

The prince is heard shouting ‘Let me go’, in Swedish followed by a distraught Sofia screaming ‘No, honey!’

In an interview with Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet Sofia and Carl Philip spoke of their ordeal.

‘We
were having a nice night out with some close friends. As we were about 
to leave Carl Philip was attacked by some strange men,’ Sofia said.

The couple maintain that the blow on the video was the first one exchanged and that the attack was completely unprovoked.

Prince Carl Philip dated PR Executive Emma Pernald for ten years before they split in 2009

‘It has been reported that our close friends were involved and we stress that this is not the case.

‘I
would like to emphazise that it was the actions of my good friends 
which ensured that this sad situation ended ok,’ the prince told the 
newspaper.

Prince Carl 
Philip, third in line to the throne after the birth of Princess Estelle in February this year, has a long withstanding reputation as a playboy who prefers driving 
race cars and wild parties to royal duties.

His relationship with ex-glamour girl Sofia caused a scandal when it came to light two years ago.

The prince had been with his previous partner PR executive Emma Pernald for ten years, and it was widely believed a wedding was on the cards when they suddenly split in March 2009.

Many high-profile royal commentators in the Scandinavian country are still in disapproving of Carl Philip's new partner, despite King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden accepting Sofia as a member of their family.

Although his son has been named the 'black sheep' of the royal family it was alleged in 2010 King Carl Gustaf himself

The unauthorised biography called The Reluctant Monarch alleges that the wholesome King of Sweden has in fact spent thousands of pounds in a strip club during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, had an extramarital affair with singer/model Camilla Henemark in the nineties and enjoyed  'coffee-girls', less-than-dressed young ladies hired to entertain the King and his friends after private dinners.

If the allegations are true it may not come as a surprise that before she bagged a royal boyfriend Sofia Hellqvist was famous for her participation in the sex and alcohol-fuelled reality show Paradise Hotel, kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson and topless appearances in the Swedish mens magazines.

The royal couple maintain that neither they nor their friends know the identity of the men who grabbed Carl Philip.

No police report has been filed and the matter is being investigated by the royal household.

According to the Swedish royal family’s Chief of Information Bertil Ternert the decision on any potential legal actions will be taken later in the week.

The nightclub situated near Port Cano harbour and it is a popular haunt for the rich and famous and has previously played host to Naomi Campbell, Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Bill Clinton as well as the Swedish royals.
