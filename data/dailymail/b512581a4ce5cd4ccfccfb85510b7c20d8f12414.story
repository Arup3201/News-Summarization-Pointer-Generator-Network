A Qantas passenger has documented his terrifying emergency landing experience after the huge double-deck airbus plane he was travelling on was forced to abandon its path when its cabin lost air pressure.

The QF2 flight reportedly dropped from 39,000 feet to 9,000 feet in just minutes on its way from Dubai to Sydney and was forced to land at Perth airport instead.

Flyer Nigel Richardson, from Melbourne, documented the dramatic landing on Twitter, and reported those on board were told: ‘Cabin crew this is an emergency descent. The aircraft is in full control’.

A Qantas A380 plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Perth airport 

Passengers appeared calm as they waited on the tarmac in Perth after the incident

He commented it was 'sort of a good news / bad news thing.’

‘Fastest descent I've ever experienced in a plane. Always interesting when you see cabin crew running too,’ he added.

‘Air conditioning problem. Aircraft not in danger. Crew very calm and professional,’ he said, before later being told by staff that the air con was not the problem and they would need to leave the plane at Perth.

Courtney Atkinson tweeted a picture of the flight path and called it an 'interesting start to the day' after the plane dropped in just 'four minutes'

Frequent flyer Nigel Richardson was woken up by the plane's quick descent 

He kept his Twitter followers updated with the situation and said there was 'full show down of air conditioning system'

Mr Richardson joked he had never been to Perth before 

Live tweeting the terrifying experience, the frequent flyer joked: ‘Look on the bright side. I've never been to Perth before. Unplanned stopover. How long we are here for – TBD.’

‘Full shut down of air conditioning system that keeps plane pressurised at altitude was the problem,’ he clarified.

He said despite the oxygen masks not dropping the incident ‘seemed to scare the crews as much as us’.

The passenger said the Qantas crew were 'very calm and professional' 

Another passenger said the pilot was keeping them informed 

Mr Richardson was later told the air con was not at fault

As the giant plane waited on the tarmac at Perth airport for a decision to be made on what to do next, Mr Richardson tweeted a photo from inside the cabin of people calmly reaching into the overhead lockers, talking and reading on their Kindles and laptops.

After first being told an air conditioning problem was at fault, he then said: ‘Air con fault not identified. Expect that ground crew need to talk to Airbus to resolve. Decision to de-plane...’

Fellow passenger Gabriella Southwell said that after the plane had made its emergency landing a pilot walking down the aisle ‘keeping people informed’.

The AirLive website reported that the A380 was 'circling to burn/dump fuel before landing to Perth'.

A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Qantas Flight QF2 travelling from Dubai to Sydney diverted to Perth due to a fault with the air conditioning. The fault occurred about 1 hour from Perth.

'As a precaution the aircraft descended to 10,000 feet and the Captain requested a priority landing .

'The aircraft landed safely and was inspected by engineers.

'As the crew reached their maximum duty limits before the issue could be fixed on the ground, customers have been provided with overnight accommodation and will be booked on the next available services today to their destination.'
