The shocking details of how a mother allegedly tortured her 2-year-old daughter before burying her in a shallow grave have emerged.

Little Tariji Gordon's body was found on February 11 in a leopard-print suitcase with three bite marks, two cigarette burns, two broken teeth, a patch of hairless scalp and bruises and marks on her head, back and bottom, according to evidence released Monday by prosecutors.

A South Florida dentist matched the bite marks to the child's mother, Rachel Fryer, 32, of Sanford, and the woman's DNA was also found on the butt end of a cigarette, which had Tariji's DNA on the burnt end.

Fryer is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, aggravated child abuse and tampering with evidence and is awaiting trial in Seminole County Jail. She has pleaded not guilty.

The tragic list of Tariji's injuries was released following a public records request by the Orlando Sentinel.Â 

Tariji died of a blow to the head on February 6, 2014, Dr. Predrag Bulic of the St. Johns County Medical Examiner's Office concluded. He said the toddler suffered major head trauma two to 24 hours before she died, according to the Sentinel.

He also told police that if the little girl had received immediate medical care she would have survived the blow.

Fryer denies killing her child. Instead,
 she told Sanford police she found her daughter unresponsive and tried 
to revive her. When she was unable to, she said she caught a ride to 
Crescent City and buried the little girl's body.

The dead child was discovered on February 11, after her former foster mother learned she was missing and alerted police.

Tariji had only been reunited with her mother two months before her death.

The 2-year-old, her two sisters and her brother were put into state care around two years ago after the child's 2-month-old twin brother died.

According to the Sentinel, investigators concluded Fryer had accidentally suffocated the baby when she fell asleep with him on a couch. She tested positive to cocaine the next day.

Other evidence revealed in the newly-released records includes the girl's blood on a couch, in a hallway and above the bathroom sink.

One of Tariji's sisters also told an investigator that Fryer regularly struck the girl because she soiled her panties and didn't do as she was told.

'Mommy Rachel is sick of her, and Mommy said that the child victim can't do anything, run, jump or go potty by herself,' a police report said, according to the newspaper.

The mother's cell phone also allegedly contained photos showing a bruised and battered Tariji ahead of her death. Police said the sad images indicated the girl 'had been subjected to prolonged abuse' since she was returned to her mother's care.
