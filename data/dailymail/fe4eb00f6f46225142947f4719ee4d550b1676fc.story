FIFA's executive committee will be asked to vote on whether the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published, it can be revealed.

German FIFA member Theo Zwanziger will formally put forward the proposal at the ExCo meeting in Marrakech.

Zwanziger however has proposed that the names contained in the 430 page report be redacted.

FIFA published its agenda for the meeting on Thursday but confirmed only that, under FIFA ethics committee business, there will be '13.1.3. Proposal submitted by Theo Zwanziger'.

Zwanziger wants fellow members to agree to a change of the ethics code which, via Article 36, currently prohibits the publication.

Garcia has compiled a report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. The American lawyer has also appealed against the initial findings into his report, delivered by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert which criticised England's bid but cleared Russia and Qatar to host the tournaments. 

Chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee Hans-Joachim Eckert has already published a summary of the report

Russia, Qatar and England were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report

Zwanziger told the Germany press agency DPA: 'I would like to see this ban relaxed so that the FIFA executive committee, as well as the public, in an appropriate form can be informed of the contents of the investigation.'

Zwanziger has previously said awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was 'one of the biggest mistakes ever in the history of sport' and in September suggested it will be moved from the country due to the scorching heat.

FIFA responded to that remark by insisting the tournament will definitely be staged in Qatar - a process is underway to decide on what time of year it will be held.
