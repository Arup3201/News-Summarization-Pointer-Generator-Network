There are many reasons to enjoy the approach of a new year. 

It's a chance to make some resolutions, there's the renewal of the holiday quota at work and most importantly these days - the enormous amount of naked calendars that flood the market. 

In the last few weeks, hunks with hounds, Army WAGs, rowers and Romanian Orthodox Christians have all stripped off for charity - now it's the gardeners' turn.

The gardeners are the latest to pose for a naked charity calendar. The follow in the path of naked rowers and Orthodox Christians 

A group of horticulturalists from across the UK come from a range of gardening jobs in places like Hever Castle and and The Roof Gardens in Kensington, west London. 

The men have teamed up to pose in the buff for a calendar that raises money for the Perennial charity, which helps people working in horticulture and their families in times of crisis. 

The men - who call themselves The Grubby Gardeners - spent the day getting their kit off at Kensington Roof Gardens for the project.

Anita Bates, Director of Marketing and Development at Perennial, said: 'Thanks so much to the all boys who had the courage to bare everything for the calendar. 

'We've been amazed at the lengths our supporters will go to in order to help fellow horticulturists in need!'

The calendar is available now for £9.99 and can be ordered at: www.perennial.org.uk/calendar
