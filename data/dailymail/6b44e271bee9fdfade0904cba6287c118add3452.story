Outrage: David Davies MP upset equal rights campaigners when he said most parents wanted their children to be heterosexual. He defended his outspoken views, saying he has not had 'years of diversity training'

Tory MP David Davies recently caused outrage when he suggested that parents wanted their children to be heterosexual and that plans to legalise gay marriage were 'barking mad'.

Now the politician has attempted to defend his comments by saying that he has not 'done years of diversity training'.

Mr Davies' continued opposition to gay marriage and outspoken comments have angered equal rights campaigners and the MP admitted that he has been 'tactless'.

He said that it was 'hard to articulate' his feelings on the Government's plan to legalise gay marriage and expected to receive 'no end of abuse' for expressing his views.

In an interview with the Guardian, the 48-year-old said: 'I haven't done years of diversity training, so sometimes I say things which are probably tactless, and I don't mean to, to be honest, I don't mean to do that.

'But these feelings are hard to articulate, and the trouble is that if you try to, and get it wrong, which I probably, frankly, am doing now, you're going to get no end of abuse for it, and upset a whole load of people, some of whom I actually quite like.'

The MP for Monmouth added: 'This law is going to happen, and the best thing to do is just shut up and accept it, really, which is probably why I shouldn't have accepted this interview. Too late now.'

The former tobacco-picker and lorry driver, who grew up in Newport, Wales, admitting that he is a 'product of my upbringing' but said that he is 'changing'.

Outspoken: David Davies said that his friends would not have been 'seen dead' with a Boy George CD when he was growing up but that he now owns the singer's Greatest Hits and 'loves it'

Mr Davies, who also serves as a special constable, said that his friends would once never have been 'seen dead' with a Boy George CD but said he now owns the singer's Greatest Hits CD, adding: 'I love it!'

In the interview, he said that he was worried that gay marriage would lead to a revision of sex education in schools, saying that he views heterosexual sex as being 'the norm'.

He told Radio Wales a fortnight ago that 'most parents would prefer their children not to be gay'.

The father-of-three drew further derision when he said that he had once fought a gay boxer called the Pink Pounder.

Mr Davies - whose nickname is Tony the Tornado - is and amateur boxer and wrote on Twitter about his bout with Charles 'Pink Pounder' Jones.

Brawler: The MP defended his comments, saying he once fought a gay boxer known as the Pink Pounder

Following criticism about his previous comments, he wrote: 'Once fought gay 
boxer. Respect & like.’

He added: ‘Trained with after bout so 
not bigoted. activists calm down- listen to other views.’ He also posted
a link to a poor quality video of the fight on YouTube.

He
beat Mr Jones, an architect who is Britain’s first openly gay boxer, on
points over three rounds in the 2008 bout in a central London gym.

His initial remarks about gay children came in the middle of Tory wrangling over gay marriage.

Senior Tories, including former prime
minister Sir John Major, Chancellor George Osborne, Education Secretary
Michael Gove and London Mayor Boris Johnson are backing measures to 
permit equal marriage.

But 120 Conservative MPs have indicated some degree of unease at the proposals in correspondence with constituents.
