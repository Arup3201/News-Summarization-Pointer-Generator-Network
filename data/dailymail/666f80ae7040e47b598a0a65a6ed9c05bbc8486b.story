Wayne Acott, 22, pictured, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of killing his baby son

A father who killed his baby son, inflicting injuries on him that are normally seen in car crash victims, has been jailed for just five years.

Wayne Acott, 22, of, Maidstone, Kent, killed four-month-old Mackenzie after staying up late playing computer games at a neighbour’s flat.

Detectives said Acott had a ‘momentary lapse of control’ at the time of the attack and had previously been described as a loving father.

After returning from his neighbour’s home in the early hours, Acott’s partner woke him hours later, asking him to feed the baby while she dropped her daughter off at school.

When she returned home and pulled into the parking bay on January 21 last year, Acott rang her mobile in a panicked state, saying Mackenzie had collapsed.

As she ran into their flat, Acott was standing with the baby in his arms.

She rang an ambulance and was told to perform CPR on Mackenzie as he had stopped breathing.

The stricken baby was in a critical condition when he arrived at Maidstone Hospital, from where he was transferred to a special baby care unit at King’s College Hospital in London.

He remained on life support for the following seven days but died from the trauma suffered to his head after failing to regain consciousness.

Doctors told the parents that Mackenzie’s injuries were like those normally seen in victims of a high-speed car accident, Kent Police said.

A post-mortem examination found he had suffered a significant traumatic event such as an impact or impacts to his head or a shaking injury.

Acott was charged with manslaughter on August 9 and pleaded not guilty on October 28.

He was found guilty yesterday following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court which started on July 9, police said.

Detective Inspector Trevor Fleming, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said afterwards: ‘It is very sad when such a young life is ended by a parent.

‘It is the case that many parents feel the strain of the early months of a new baby.

‘Unfortunately it would appear this young man had a momentary lapse of control.

He had before that been described as a loving father.

‘A number of agencies are available to help new parents and they should not be afraid to ask for help.’
