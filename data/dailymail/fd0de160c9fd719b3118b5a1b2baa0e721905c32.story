The tankers loaded with kerosene, gas oil and diesel went up in 100 foot high flames and it took 10 fire crews to tackle the inferno.

Nearby homes were evacuated and a road closed as firefighters fought to control 35,750 litres of flaming fuel at Lady Lane Industrial Estate in Hadleigh, Suffolk, on Friday evening.
