The European Union and Turkey have signed agreements which could see the possible lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens travelling to Europe.

The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the signing today as a ‘milestone’ in relations between his country and the 28-member bloc. 

Under the agreements signed in the Turkish capital Ankara, Turkey would in turn, agree to take back immigrants who illegally enter the EU from Turkish territory.

The deals on visa-free travel and the re-admission of immigrants come weeks after the EU resumed membership negotiations with Turkey that began in 2005 but have been stalled for more than three years, mainly due to Turkey's dispute with EU-member Cyprus and scepticism in some European nations on admitting a populous, largely Muslim country into the group.

The EU is refusing to start negotiations in eight policy areas until Turkey opens its ports and airports to goods from Cyprus. The island was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkish Cypriots in 1983 declared an independent northern state, which is only recognized by Turkey.

Turks have long complained about 
onerous visa demands from European nations that were designed to 
restrict Turkish citizens from flooding labour markets. 

Prime
Minister Erdogan said Turkey was no longer an exporter of labour and 
that the country's dynamic economy over the past 10 years meant that the
country had now become a destination for jobseekers.

Mr Erdogan said during the signing ceremony: ‘No one should be concerned when the visas are lifted. 

‘We are not a country that is a burden [to the EU] but one that takes away its burdens.’

Easier for immigrants: The agreement could mean that visa restrictions will be lifted, allowing Turkish citizens to travel without restrictions to EU countries

The agreements foresee a deal on the lifting of visa restrictions within 3 years but Mr Erdogan said he hoped it can be done much sooner. 

The EU resumed negotiations with Turkey in November despite human rights concerns and its criticism over a police crackdown on this summer's anti-government demonstrations. 

An EU report on Turkey's progress toward membership criticised Mr Erdogan's government for what it called its ‘uncompromising stance’ against dissent and its failure to protect fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and assembly.
