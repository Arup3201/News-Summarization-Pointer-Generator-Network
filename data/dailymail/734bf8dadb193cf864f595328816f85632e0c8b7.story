Boxing fans are getting a chance to own a piece of one of the most hotly debated title fights ever.

The gloves worn by Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston in their 1965 heavyweight rematch in Lewiston, Maine, are going on the auction block, just months before the fight's 50th anniversary.

They're expected to bring in more than $1 million (£670,000) at the Heritage Auctions sale on Feb. 21 in New York.

Liston struggles to raise himself from the canvas after what many believe was a 'phantom punch'

The gloves worn by fighters are expected to raise £600,000 in auction ahead of the fight's 50th anniversary

Ali won the May 25, 1965, fight with a first-round knockout from what some saw as a 'phantom punch.' It's not clear whether Ali's quick right hand actually connected. Some question whether Liston threw the bout.

Ali signed both pairs of gloves when he came to Lewiston in 1995 to celebrate the fight's 30th anniversary. Liston died in 1970.
