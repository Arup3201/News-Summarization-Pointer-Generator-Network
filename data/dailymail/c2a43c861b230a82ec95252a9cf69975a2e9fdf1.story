A onetime California school official was sentenced Monday to 10 years in state prison for sexually assaulting two women when they were her students, including a woman who confronted her in a recorded phone call that went viral on YouTube.

Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. 

She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts.

Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years

Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said

Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said.

In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister.

In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her.

The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children.

In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago.

Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 

'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said.

'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.'

Cardosa later resigned. 

Confession: The then  28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school

More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused 

She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?'

To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.'

Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'.

When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.'

Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department.

Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants.

The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. 

The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.'

Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered.

The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing.

'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.'

Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. 

Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. 

Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris.

A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement. 

The victims also have sued the Riverside Unified and Val Verde Unified school districts.
