Heathrow Express staff will walk out 
for 24 hours from midday tomorrow, with further action planned on 
Saturday.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union is campaigning against £6 million of cuts which it warned will hit jobs, pay and conditions.

A service between Heathrow Airport 
and London despite the strike and bosses warned that industrial action made job
 losses more likely.

Angry: Staff at Heathrow Express will walk out over massive cuts which unions say will hit jobs, pay and working conditions

Managing director Keith Greenfield said: 'Our high-speed link to 
Heathrow will once more run at its usual frequency - every 15 minutes - 
despite only a third of our workforce being available.

'We are carrying on almost as normal. We recommend our customers do likewise.

'Since February we have been crystal clear: our proposals enable 
us to save £6 million over the next five years without any job losses - 
provided costs are not driven up by repeated strikes.

'As I said last week, the strikes planned for this week will make
 it difficult to avoid the need for job losses. This is not what we 
want.

'While the RMT leadership does not seem to care
 about its members' futures, I do. For that reason I would ask each and 
every RMT member planning to strike this week to reconsider.'

Mr Greenfield will again be among head office staff standing in 
as ticket inspectors and customer service representatives during this 
week's walkouts.

Skeleton staff: The service will run as usual but with head office taking on the extra duties

RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash said: 'Heathrow Express 
sabotaged talks aimed at resolving this dispute and have now issued the 
most outrageous and provocative blanket threat to start sacking staff if
 they don't call off the fight for jobs and safety on this lucrative and
 prestigious transport link.

'The atmosphere has been poisoned at Heathrow Express by an 
aggressive and bullying anti-union management and it is about time that 
the airport authorities woke up to what's happening on their turf and 
the damage that it is doing to Heathrow's reputation.

'The Heathrow Express staff provide an essential service out to 
one of the world's busiest airports and yet the company have resorted to
 treating them like dirt. It is an outrage that exposes this company for
 the anti-union, greedy and callous bunch that they are.'
