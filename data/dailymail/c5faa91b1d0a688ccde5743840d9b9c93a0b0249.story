MEET THE STRONG ARM OF THE LAW

Weightlifter Michael Francois of the Turks and Caicos Islands came bottom of the men’s 94kg, but he’s still the ‘strongest policeman’ on the Turks.

The 29-year-old, a sergeant in the island’s police force, arrived in Glasgow fresh from arresting a drug dealer, after all.

Francois said: ‘Whenever there’s trouble, who do you think they’re going to call? Me. ‘In July we had to do a drug bust. I fought the dealer, kept him on the ground and took away his drugs. ‘Don’t worry there is no crime (on Turks). Because I’m there.’

Fergie: Ferguson Rotich (centre) in action during the men's 800m heat on Tuesday

Kenyan 800m runner Cheruiyot Ferguson Rotich, who was second in his heat on Tuesday, must love being in Glasgow after changing his name to honour one of the city’s most famous sons — Sir Alex Ferguson.

Why the change? ‘Because they can’t stop winning,’ he said. Clearly the name change occurred pre-2013.

England table tennis player Tin-Tin Ho, 15, won her two matches in the preliminary round of the women’s singles on Tuesday and then delivered a lesson in her art. She’s a ‘penholder’, apparently, meaning her thumb and index fingers grip the racket handle.

‘Penhold style runs in the family,’ she said, ‘because my dad used to play and he was a penholder as well, so he taught me and my brother that way — it’s just how I started.’

SECOND GOLD FOR LUCKY LUCKMAN

The full-bore rifle Queen’s Prize individual event is one of the quirkier events in Glasgow, but it proved a happy hunting ground for England’s David Luckman.

The 38-year-old, competing at his first Commonwealth Games, claimed his second gold in four days after winning the pairs with Parag Patel on Saturday.

As might be expected of an event that began in 1860, tradition dictated that Luckman was transported to the medal ceremony in a Sedan chair carried by his opponents.

Olympic silver medallist Emma Pooley will retire from cycling after competing for England in Sunday’s road race. The 31-year-old won time-trial Olympic silver in Beijing in 2008 after helping Nicole Cooke to road-race gold.

She said: ‘I considered retiring after the London Olympics, but I didn’t feel I was ready. The Commonwealth Games is the perfect opportunity — it’s a big event, almost at home, and I want to go out properly with no regrets.’

BETTER THAN BRAD?

Dan Rivers added another gold for England after a successful day at the shooting. His victory in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions came just four days after winning a bronze in the 10m Air Rifle. ‘I didn’t think it could get much better than the bronze, but it has,’ he said.

‘It’s an amazing feeling. The air rifle was a surprise, but this is my strongest event.’ Rivers’ sporting hero is apparently Sir Bradley Wiggins and now he has a medal that still eludes the great cyclist — a Commonwealth Gold.

Mountain Biking made a return to the Games after an eight-year absence, but it ended in disappointment for the home nations.

England’s Annie Last finished fourth in the women’s event while Scotland’s Grant Ferguson came fifth in the men’s. Liam Killeen won gold for England the last time it was contested in Melbourne but, despite being one of the pre-event favourites, could only manage sixth.

Shooter Jen McIntosh became the first Scottish woman to win five Commonwealth medals after adding silver in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions to her 50m Rifle Prone bronze. The previous Scottish record holder? Her mum, and fellow shooter, Shirley.

His name might be X-rated but he put in a performance to match. England’s Chinu Xxx (yes, really) defeated Kenya’s Hollis Mkanga to win bronze in the FS 125kg wrestling.
