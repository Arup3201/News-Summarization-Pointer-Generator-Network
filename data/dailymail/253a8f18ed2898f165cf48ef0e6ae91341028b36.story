General Martin Dempsey says the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrates that the military superiority enjoyed by the U.S does not necessarily carry over to the cyberworld.

As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dempsey serves as President Barack Obama's chief military adviser.

Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour.' He said such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be hugely disruptive.

Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour' and said that such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be incredibly disruptive

Dempsey said the U.S. has peer competitors in cyberwarfare and went as far as calling it a level playing field. That makes him very uncomfortable, Dempsey said.

He did not go into detail about steps the U.S. could take to beef up its cyber defences.

Dempsey's comments follow an attack on Sony pictures late last year by a North Korean hacking group calling themselves 'Guardians of Peace'.

The hackers released a series of embarrassing emails, including correspondence between Sony Pictures co-chairwoman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, who referred to Angelina Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Among correspondence released was emails between producer Scott Rudin, middle, and Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal; in the emails Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat'

Parts of the script for the new James Bond film Spectre, which is due to be released in 2015, were also released by the hackers, as well as emails about the plot lines.

The Sony letters were published ahead of the release of 'The Interview', a film which takes the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as its subject matter. Several cinemas refused to show the film, which Sony first pulled but later made available on the internet.
