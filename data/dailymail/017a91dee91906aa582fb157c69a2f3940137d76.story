Concerns: Frances O'Grady spoke of a pay gap

A generation of young graduates are stuck in low-paid jobs such as working as baristas in coffee shops, the Trades Union Congress leader warned yesterday.

Frances O’Grady voiced fears about the ‘generational pay gap’ between older workers and their children and grandchildren.

She said it was ‘clearly’ wrong to suggest older people were over-paid, but ‘it doesn’t look like a very bright future’ for a generation of young workers trapped in dead-end jobs.

Graduates under 25 are doing jobs that are ‘well below their talent’ following ‘a shift away from the jobs and industries which used to pay well to these low-paid service sector jobs,’ she added.

Last year, more than 1,700 people applied for just eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid between £6.10 and £10 an hour.

Miss O’Grady said: ‘Many young people will end up as a barista who in the past would have ended up in a manufacturing job – high quality, high value, good prospects. That is not the case if you are a barista.’

Her comments came after the Employment Minister insisted young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in the service industry and work their way up.

Esther McVey said: ‘You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area”, or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’

Miss O’Grady’s comments came ahead of the TUC’s annual conference, which begins on Sunday.

She also took the opportunity to slam wealthy politicians, saying many have ‘a touch of the Marie Antoinette’ and cannot understand the plight of ordinary Britons.

Many members of the Cabinet attended top public schools, including the Prime Minister, who went to Eton College, and the Chancellor, who went to St Paul’s.

Miss O’Grady, who attended a grammar school which became a comprehensive, and earns a basic salary of £106,333, said: ‘I don’t personally care what background people come from ... but it does seem to me to be a failure of imagination to think that ordinary working people can keep taking pay cuts.

‘Some politicians need to get real and understand most of us don’t have an inheritance to rely on.’

A recent report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that since the Second World War, each generation has been wealthier than the previous one, but that this trend ‘may be coming to a halt’.
