Andy Murray has paid tribute to the fans who have helped him to the brink of sporting history today at Wimbledon.

As he prepares to step out on to Centre Court shortly before 2pm to face Novak Djokovic in his quest to become the first Briton to win the men’s singles in 77 years, he said: ‘It is a shame the stadium isn’t bigger.’

On his way to the final, especially in the latter rounds when he has lost crucial points or sets, Murray has been reminded of the formidable weapon that the faith of 15,000 people brings to his armoury.

Title shot: Andy Murray is hoping to become the first British Wimbledon champion since Fred Perry in 1936

Don't choke! This  was Novak Djokovic getting a tweak from his physio 
yesterday, but the world No.1 can expect  to be stretched much further 
 by Murray this afternoon

‘When I am on the court the support 
has been unbelievable at the end of matches,’ he told The Mail on 
Sunday. ‘That is what you need if you want to try to win these events.’

Many neutrals were won over by Murray’s tearful address to the Centre Court following his defeat by Roger Federer last year.

Now he hopes to harness that 
heartfelt support as he faces an equally dangerous opponent in his bid 
to become the first British champion since Fred Perry in 1936.

‘When
 you are on the court you are obviously just in the moment,’ he said. 
‘You know what is going on in the crowd, but there so many other people 
out there, loads of people obviously just queue to watch on the hill. It
 is just a shame that the stadium isn’t bigger.’

It will be tough conditions for both 
Murray and Djokovic out on centre court as temperatures are set to soar 
to 30C (86F) in west London.

Murray-mania sparked a late rush for tickets yesterday – with one seller asking nearly £84,000 for a pair.

Prices for debenture seats on legal secondary ticketing websites have soared way past their normal levels – peaking with that high of £83,785 on Viagogo.

That is also a record for the firm.

A pair of tickets to sit in Block 318 – just behind the Royal Box – hit £71,703 on website Seatwave, including a £10,800 booking fee.

Thermometers at Heathrow and Kew 
Gardens in the capital nudged 28.1C (82.6F) yesterday, but those 
temperatures are set to be put in the shade today.

Matt Dobson, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'We are looking at temperatures of between 26C (78.8F) and 29C (84.2F) across many inland parts of England and eastern Wales, and we could just see 30C (86F) likely in west London.

'Yesterday was the hottest day of the year so far, and it is fairly comfortable that we are going to beat that today, with the favourite spot to do so being west London and the Thames Valley.'

Murray will, as always, be driven 
from his £5.5 million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, to the All England 
Club at about 10.30am by friend Rob Stewart in his VW Polo, oblivious to
 the queues as he enters at a sidegate near the practice courts.

En
 route, he may well listen to his pre-match ‘relaxing’ playlist, which 
as he revealed last week features You’re Never Over by Eminem, Drunk by 
Ed Sheeran, Maggie May by Rod Stewart and AC/DC’s You Shook Me All Night
 Long.

The
 2011 champion Djokovic is likely to be listening to his favoured early 
Oasis tracks when he travels in an official car with tinted windows from
 his rented accommodation.

The
 26-year-old Serb is under no illusions about which player will be 
receiving the most support: ‘It’s normal to expect the crowd to be on 
his side,’ he said.

‘He’s
 a local hero. He has a big chance to win Wimbledon after a long time 
for this nation. I know I’m going to be playing against one of the 
biggest tennis players in the world in the last five years. I’m ready 
for it.’

Under pressure: Andy Murray swelters in the sun during a training session yesterday - but temperatures are expected to soar even higher to 30C during the final this afternoon

Murray beat Djokovic in last September’s US Open final. Djokovic later admitted the Scot deserved to win.

Murray declared himself better 
prepared mentally for today’s final than he had been for his clash with 
Federer 12 months ago. ‘I definitely feel calmer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully 
when I get on the court I will be a bit fresher mentally.

‘Any tennis player wants to win Wimbledon, and the closer you get to it the more you are  going to think about it.

‘But
 the most important thing is that you aren’t looking ahead. At no stage 
of the match can you get too ahead of yourself – against most players 
that is dangerous, against someone like Novak that is even more 
dangerous. I am going to need to earn every point tomorrow.’

Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears will be
 sitting in the player's box on centre court to cheer him on, along with
 members of his family.

And, despite the 'Curse of Cameron', 
the Prime Minister will also be attending the match while Downing Street
 will fly the Scottish Saltire to mark the occasion.

A string of stars have seen their hopes of glory fade following previous endorsement from the Tory leader.

Earlier this week, the PM sent his 
best wishes to Britain's number one female player Laura Robson, 19, 
shortly before her fourth-round exit.

Last summer he arrived at Wimbledon for the finals, where Murray was defeated by Roger Federer, and he followed this with a series of visits to Olympic events where British medal hopefuls lost out.

Murray’s support will, of course, 
spread much further afield than SW19. The British TV audience is likely 
to be higher than the 16.9 million who tuned in for last year’s final 
and is tipped to break the Wimbledon all-time record of 17.3 million. Tens of millions more will tune in from around the world.

Former
 British Davis Cup captain John Lloyd believes Murray’s success in last 
year’s US Open has set him on a roll  and the Wimbledon title will be 
the start of a succession of honours for the 26-year-old.

He said: ‘I am convinced that Murray 
will be knighted at some stage in his life. Winning Wimbledon will just 
accelerate the honour being bestowed on him.'

'As Wimbledon champion, Murray’s fame
 would spread across the world to make him the second most recognisable 
British sportsman after David Beckham. The title will have that much 
effect.’

They are known as the Queens of the Centre Court, though neither have struck a single ball. While  their partners slug it out, glamourous blondes Kim Sears, above right, and Jelena Ristic, respective partners of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, will today do battle in the fashion stakes.

So far during this tournament Kim has worn outfits from Ted Baker, Whistles and Zara – all of which have experienced a subsequent surge in demand. Sales of a £25 ASOS dress Jelena has worn courtside have also rallied afterwards.

Jelena, 27, insists the rivalry remains friendly and both couples get on well. She said: ‘Kim and Andy are really nice and there is no negative energy between Novak and Andy. They are gentlemen.’

Murray, 26, is expected to land a 
raft of new sponsorship deals if he emerges triumphant today and stands 
to rake in up to £15 million a year.

The boost to his finances could put 
him just behind Lennox Lewis and David Beckham as one of the top earning
 British sports stars in history.

The Scot, who won his first grand 
slam at the US Open last year, was ranked at number 32 in The Sunday 
Times Sports Rich List 2013 with an estimated fortune of £32 million.

Victory against Novak Djokovic today would land him £1.6 million in prize money.

Nigel Currie, director of the sports 
marketing agency brandRapport, said the British number one could then 
profit from a series of lucrative new contracts.

'If Murray wins at Wimbledon, it 
means he is not a one-hit-wonder,' Mr Currie said. 'With Roger Federer 
beginning to show his age and his form perhaps fading, and Rafael Nadal 
with injury worries, it could mean that Murray and Novak Djokovic will 
be the main two for the next few years.

'If you're number one or two in the 
world of tennis, which is such a global sport, the marketing 
opportunities are fantastic. Murray could secure some really big deals 
with the biggest brands.

'He's reported to be earning £8 
million or £9 million off court at the moment. We could see that edging 
up to £15 million if he wins at Wimbledon.'

Andy Murray's battle against Novak Djokovic is set to shatter the all-time Wimbledon TV viewing figures record.

Last year’s final between Murray and Roger Federer pulled in a peak of 16.9 million viewers for BBC1.

That fell short of the all-time record of 17.3 million when Bjorn Borg beat John McEnroe in five sets in 1980.

But today’s final is expected to beat that – and hundreds of thousands more fans will tune in live via the internet.

Sales of champagne are expected to reach new levels at Wimbledon this year.

Up to 25,000 bottles of Lanson champagne, priced from £67 to £74, will have been quaffed by the end of today’s final – 15 per cent more than last year.

Paul Beavis, managing director of Lanson International UK, said: ‘We sold 10,000 bottles in the first week of the tournament which was well up on 2012.

‘it has certainly helped that Mr Murray has been doing so well.’

It was a great start to the weekend sport yesterday as the Lions beat Australia in Sydney to win the series. Daniel Craig joined MoS columnist Mike Phillips to celebrate
