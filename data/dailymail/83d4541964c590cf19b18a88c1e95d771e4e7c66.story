Nicknamed man's best friend, dogs are thought of as loveable, cuddly and faithful to their masters.

But that may need to be re-evaluated after a hunter in Minnesota was shot by his trusty companion.

The unnamed 19-year-old was out shooting waterfowl in a boat on Leech River, in Cass County, Minneapolis, when the dog decided to jump aboard.

Unfortunately the animal landed on the trigger of a shotgun, blasting pellets into the teenager's lower leg.

After rushing himself to hospital, medics treated the man for non-life threatening injuries.

Luckily for the dog, the Sheriff's Office has said that no charges are pending, though the incident is being investigated.

This attack is only the latest sinister episode in a spate of dog-related shootings, prompting some Twitter users to announce the start of a canine uprising.

In February this year a man was shot in the leg by a 9mm pistol in Florida after his dog kicked the trigger.

Gregory Dale Lanier, 35, was driving near Sebring with the gun on the floor of his truck when his pet accidentally shot him.

The injury came as something of a surprise to Lanier, who thought the gun wasn't loaded.

In September 2012 a French huntsmanÂ  had to have his right hand amputated after one of his dogs jumped up at him and caught the trigger of his shotgun.

The blast, caused by a Blue Gascony Basset hound, blew off part of his hand while he was out near St Michel de Double, near Mussidan.

The 55-year-old local man was airlifted to hospital in Bordeaux and said he did not hold the incident against his dog 'at all'.

Finally, in 2011, another Florida man, Billy E. Brown, was shot once in the thigh as he drove to a deer hunting spot in Pasco County.

The 78-year-old was hit just above the right knee by his bulldog Eli after the animal became excited.
