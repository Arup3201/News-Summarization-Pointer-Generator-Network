Steve Howey was in England’s Euro 96 squad that reached the semi-finals.

Wolves’ striker Steve Bull was in the England squad that only missed out on a World Cup final in 1990 after another penalty shootout failure.

I applaud them, and I certainly don’t mean any disrespect, but if you’re honest you’ll agree it’s hard to believe what Steve and Steve achieved.

England are looking strong and should have a good chance at the European Championship next year

Roy Hodgson has an exciting squad at his disposal and England should go deep into the tournament 

England players head out of the Wembley tunnel for the second half of their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania

What it shows is that you don’t have to have 23 truly top class players in your squad to make an impact at a tournament.

So what’s stopping England next summer?

History – that is all. And the right partner for Gary Cahill.

If one of John Stones, Phil Jones or Chris Smalling – or maybe a centre half who might burst on to the scene next season – can show the quality and consistency needed to make himself a regular in the England team then that’s Roy Hodgson’s last problem solved.

All other departments are looking healthy, fitness notwithstanding. Goalkeeper Joe Hart is looking the best he’s ever looked. 

Finding a partner for Gary Cahill in central defence is Hodgson's main concern ahead of the tournament 

Phil Jones played alongside Cahill against Lithuania but the place is far from nailed down

Goalkeeper Joe Hart has performed consistently well for club Manchester City and country

We have athletic young full backs who thrive in the modern game at club level; Cahill is still trusted by Jose Mourinho, and has another year of learning off John Terry to come

In midfield it’s now a shock if Jordan Henderson doesn't start for club and country; Adam Lallana is looking a class act after an injury-hit difficult start at Liverpool.

Michael Carrick is at last being trusted by an England manager and if Roy keeps ignoring those who say he isn't quick enough (his reading of the game more than makes up for that) or doesn't score enough goals (the goal counters playing FIFA have a lot to answer for) he may well be rewarded.

Fabian Delph looks at home in an England shirt if he keeps his discipline and then there are other talents like Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley.

Up front England have their best options since Euro 96. Danny Welbeck has work-rate in abundance, he also has quality and goals.

Jordan Henderson has tied down his place in the centre of the England midfield 

Michael Carrick appears to have won the trust of manager Roy Hodgson at last

Raheem Sterling was electric on Friday and if he can replicate that at the Euros, then he certainly is a player opponents will be scared of. Look at his trick and cross for Harry Kane’s goal – that’s top class. 

Wayne Rooney is on the brink of becoming an England legend, his focus and ambition has been sharpened by the captaincy and by the reality that he’s running out of time to make a significant impact at a major tournament.

Theo Walcott’s pace could be useful, and of course Harry Kane is ripping it up whenever he sets foot on a football pitch.

When I think about the players England have, I feel optimistic. These players are playing in a way that is pleasing on the eye, credit to Hodgson for that.

But then I think of the World Cup and how horrible that was from the fans' point of view. And then I remember every other tournament we’ve been in since Euro 96 and we’ve either not played very well, or not got very far.

Raheem Sterling capped an electric performance against Lithuania on Friday with a goal

Captaincy has improved Wayne Rooney even more and he is on the verge of becoming an England legend

Harry Kane, who scored on debut against Lithuania, provides further reinforcement up front

History demands a negative outlook and it’s up to the manager and the players to prove that wrong.

They’re playing some good stuff, albeit in some straightforward qualifiers, but then some big nations are not sitting top of their groups right now - Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain and Belgium most notably.

And England’s group may be comfortable, but arguably the best performance came in the toughest game since the World Cup, away to Switzerland, a team who got further at the World Cup and who are above us in the world rankings.

The challenge for Hodgson is whether he can maintain those standards when the opposition is tougher in France 2016.

There is one thing Hodgson has that so many previous England managers lacked.

He has the trust of the players and that could be vital. England imploded in South Africa in 2010 when Capello picked the wrong players and then treated them appallingly at the tournament.

Unlike Fabio Capello in 2010, Hodgson has the complete trust of his squad

Hodgson resisted calls to replace the in-form Danny Welbeck with Kane and was proved correct

For the Lithuania game on Friday, Hodgson ignored the calls to start Kane and that was exactly the right thing to do. Not because Kane isn't good enough – far from it.

But Hodgson knew that if he dropped Welbeck the rest of the players would not – could not – respect that decision.

Welbeck has been excellent in qualifying so far for England – there was no reason to drop a man who scored both goals in our toughest qualifier so far.

If a player has done the job asked of him, there is no reason to drop him. If a manager drops that player, that decision instantly affects the relationship between players and manager. At international level, with limited time to nurture or repair relationships, a manager cannot afford to lose the trust of his squad.

There are lots of positives about the current England situation.

But as fans can we afford to be positive when we’ve been let down so many times in the last 20 years?

I want England to win the European Championship, but until it happens it will always be an unrealistic dream.
