Keir Starmer has urged residents along the route of HS2 to use the Human Rights Act to claim more compensation

Labour’s new golden boy Keir Starmer has waded into the row over the HS2 rail link by claiming it breaches the European Convention on Human Rights.

The former Director of Public Prosecutions, claims homeowners hit by the £50 billion project have not been offered proper compensation – and urged them to use human rights laws to get more.

The move has fuelled rumours that Mr Starmer is being lined up to replace former Labour Cabinet Minister Frank Dobson as an MP.

Just two days ago, Mr Starmer was named Ed Miliband’s adviser on crime victims’ legal rights.  

Mr Dobson, 73, is expected to retire from Parliament at the next Election.

His Holborn and St Pancras seat includes Euston station, where HS2 will terminate, and residents fear they stand to lose a fortune.

Labour is already split over the rail link. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls wanted to ditch the party’s support for it but was overruled by Mr Miliband after Labour council leaders in the North said it was vital to the economy.

It was claimed Mr Starmer’s call could add ‘hundreds of millions’ to the Government’s HS2 bill.

Owners of properties affected have already started receiving ‘exceptional hardship’ payments, with a total of £58 million paid out in 131 cases, even though major work will not start until 2017.

But Mr Starmer says that a bigger compensation scheme, due to be launched in the summer, contains a ‘fundamental’ flaw.

In advice prepared for residents in Mr 
Dobson’s constituency, Mr Starmer said locals ‘will suffer substantial 
loss’ and yet no ‘robust’ assessment of the potential losses had been 
planned.

Following his remarks rumours have started that Starmer is lining himself up for the Labour seat of Holborn and St Pancras which contains Euston station (pictured), where the line will end

He said those affected do not have a proper say – in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Department for Transport rejected Mr Starmer’s claim, adding that it had already gone ‘above and beyond’ what was required in compensation.

Asked if he hoped to take Mr Dobson’s seat, a spokeswoman for Mr Starmer said he was ‘considering his options’.
