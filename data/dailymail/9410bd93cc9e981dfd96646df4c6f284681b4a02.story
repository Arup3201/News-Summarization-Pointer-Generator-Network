Face cream made from human blood has emerged as the latest craze in celebrity skincare

Want to know the secret to youthful skin? It seems the answer could be in your DNA.

Face cream made from human blood has emerged as the latest craze in celebrity skincare.

Used by various celebrities, each £950 tub of the 'MC1' cream is made using proteins and growth factors found in blood.

And it claims to reduce the signs of ageing by building collagen, shrinking pores and increasing the healing power of cells in the skin, as well as helping to clear up conditions such as psoriasis.

The cream, which has been created by cosmetic doctor Barbara Sturm, was developed in Germany and is now being made available in the UK for the first time, at London's Dorchester hotel.

It contains proteins, which have healing properties, which are extracted from the client's own blood. And Dr Sturm, whose celebrity clients include The Nutty Professor actress Jada Pinkett Smith and Being John Malkovich star John Cusack, said it is 'the future' for skin treatment.

Once known for dating actor George Hamilton, Dr Sturm said there is a demand for the cream among people 'whose face is their business'.

And she said: 'The results are spectacular and immediate. My 'MC1' cream takes the inflammation out of your skin, shrinks the pores, builds collagen, and creates a radiant and healthy 'glow' to each patient's skin. It has also been effective in reducing dermatitis, psoriasis and acne, and in speeding wound healing.'

Each pot is of Dr Sturm's cream is tailor made using a blood sample taken from a client when they check in at the Dorchester, which is popular with stars including Kate Moss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Elle Macpherson and Sienna Miller.

It is processed through a special syringe and incubated at 37ºC for about four to six hours, which increases the production of proteins and growth factors. These are then separated and extracted from the blood and added to a pot of Dr Sturm's cream.

And clients receive their 50ml tub of the cream the following day, while Dr Sturm keeps a vial of frozen blood for future use.

Dr Sturm, who is a former orthopaedic surgeon, now travels the world to treat her a-list clients' skin complaints. She claimed bespoke treatments like hers are the most effective way of treating the skin, adding: 'Since over the counter products are typically full of marketing rather than medical ideas, and aggressive ingredients like fragrance, parabens, and mineral oils, I believe effective bespoke treatments will be the wave of the future. People whose face is their business have to take the best care of it.'

Dr Sturm has already established herself among the well-healed by offering her spa treatments at the exclusive Hotel Aurelio ski chalet in Austria.

There, guests can wind down after a day on the slopes with a facial. Dr Sturm's products are also sold on Net-A-Porter.

However 'MC1' cream is only available at The Dorchester.

1. A blood sample is taken from the client upon arrival at the Dorchester Hotel.

2. The sample is incubated 37ºC for about four to six hours, during which time it begins producing proteins and healing growth factors.

3. Proteins are separated and extracted from the blood sample using a special syringe and put into Dr Sturm' base cream.

4. The following day a 50ml pot of the bespoke cream is delivered to the client for use.

5. A vial of the blood sample is frozen and retained by Dr Sturm so more pots of the cream can be made in the future.
