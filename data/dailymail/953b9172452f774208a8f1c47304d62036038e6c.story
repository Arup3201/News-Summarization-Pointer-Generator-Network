Nemanja Matic's three-match ban has been reduced to two after an appeal but Chelsea claim they are 'appalled' by the Football Association's ruling.

An independent commission reduced the suspension after examining the evidence from the incident which took place during a 1-1 draw against Burnley at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

Matic was dismissed for violent conduct after retaliating to a high tackle by Ashley Barnes, which Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho described as 'criminal' and 'career ending'.

Roger Burden, chairman of the Regulatory Commission, explained the reduction took into account the 'level of force' used by Matic, who will miss Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur and a Barclays Premier League game against West Ham.

Burden said: 'In reaching this decision the members of the Regulatory Commission rejected the mitigation advanced by Nemanja Matic in respect of the provocation and tackle he received which led to his act of violent conduct.

'The violent response of Mr Matic to the nature of the tackle cannot be condoned and does not vindicate his subsequent actions. The members of the Commission did, however, accept the mitigation in respect of the level of force used by Mr Matic and the nature of the contact he made with Mr Barnes of Burnley FC.

'Having made those considerations we determined that the standard punishment of a three-match suspension would be clearly excessive and, therefore, ordered that the suspension be reduced to two matches.'

Chelsea and manager Mourinho produced a dossier to present to the FA as part of midfielder Matic's appeal

Chelsea were quick to react to the judgement with a statement on their website, headlined: 'Chelsea appalled with the FA's decision on Matic.' It added  the board were 'extremely disappointed and frustrated' by the FA's decision not to reduce the ban further.

The statement added: 'There has been universal condemnation of the reckless challenge made by Ashley Barnes on Matic and it is the club's view that he has been unjustly punished with a two-match ban for his reaction to a career-threatening tackle.

'It is Chelsea's opinion that referees and the football authorities must do more to protect players at all levels of the game from dangerous challenges. This decision also clearly demonstrates a need for consistency and fairness in the disciplinary process.

'The club awaits The FA's written reasons, prior to commenting further.'

Chelsea had prepared a dossier of incidents featuring Jan Vertonghen, Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart to present to the FA as part of their appeal against Matic's three-game ban. 

Chelsea hoped that by flagging up other similar decisions that the FA would cut the sentence.

The Premier League leaders prepared a number of examples within their evidence submitted to the FA on Tuesday, with Vertonghen, Wilshere, Hart and Swansea's Wayne Routledge all involved.

The five incidents - none of which saw the culprits banned - picked out for inclusion are taken from the last four months of the season and aim to show that Matic's ban is excessive in comparison.
