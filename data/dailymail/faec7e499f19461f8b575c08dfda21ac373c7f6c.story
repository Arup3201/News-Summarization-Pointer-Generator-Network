Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are determined to keep the education of their 11-year-old son 'out of politics'

Nick Clegg yesterday defended the possibility he may send his children to private schools as it emerged he and his wife Miriam have not even visited their local state school.

He said the education of his 11-year-old son Antonio, who starts secondary school this year, should not be used as 'a political football' and that the couple would do 'what's best' for their children although he was braced for criticism.

Last week the Liberal Democrat leader told listeners to his radio show he would send his son to a private school if he failed to find a place in a good comprehensive, saying he would use the state system 'if it works out', but that there is 'huge competition' for places in London.

But Mr Clegg, who attended Westminster public school, has apparently not looked around nearby Ark Putney academy in south-west London, it was revealed yesterday by its headmaster Mark Phillips.

Mr Phillips who has turned the school around since he was hired three years ago, said the school which was once in special measures but is now lauded by the Government for its improvements, could provide an 'exceptional' education for any child and that there was no need to pay fees for schooling. 

Unless the Cleggs had visited 'under cover' he had not seen them, he said.'I am always very clear that all parents living locally are welcome to choose our school and it is important that every parent comes with their child and takes an objective look to see whether what we offer will meet the needs of their child', he said.

'It wouldn't claim to be the answer to every child and every parent. But I hope that if a parent does come, and sees an environment their child will thrive in, they will pick us...I am confident they will do exceptionally well. I don't believe you have to pay for it.'

Mr Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he and his wife will do whatever is in the interests of their son

If he chooses to educate his children
privately, Mr Clegg is likely to be accused of hypocrisy after using a 
speech last year to attack 'the great rift in our education system' 
caused by many of the best schools being fee-paying and said it had a 
'corrosive' effect on society and the economy.

In
an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I accept that it's a
dilemma for anyone in public life, particularly in politics, how do you
balance that with the fact Miriam and I have small children, and the 
approach Miriam and I took right from the outset was to keep our 
children completely out of politics.

'We
never put them in front of the camera or to make them or their 
education a political football.

'I totally accept that when we make a 
decision that'll be subject to public commentary, criticism and so on, 
but in the meantime we want to protect the privacy of an 11-year-old boy
and make the decision that we as parents think is best for our son.'

The deadline for applying for entry to Ark Putney for 2013-14 was last October. The school is part of the Ark academy chain, set up in 2004, whose chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats' biggest donors.

Last year 62 per cent of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs, prompting schools minister Nick Gibb to write to Mr Phillips to congratulate him on the 'excellent results' saying the school was in the top 100 best-performing, based on sustained improvements every year since 2008.

However Michael Gove last year approved the sale of five acres of playing fields at the school including six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground, to developers to fund refurbishments, after a £40million revamp under the Building Schools for the Future programme was cancelled.

Alumni of Ark Putney, which used to be Elliott School, include actor Pierce Brosnan, and 1960s England bowler Geoff Arnold. Former Welsh secretary Peter Hain sent his children to the school, which was the scene of the Christmas play in the film Love, Actually.

David Cameron has said his children will attend state school, but George Osborne has been criticised for sending his to the fee-paying preparatory school in Kensington that he attended.
