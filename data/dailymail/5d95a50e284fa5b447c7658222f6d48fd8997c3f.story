It is a controversial topic and one that may make for uncomfortable viewing.

BBC drama Call The Midwife is to tell the story of a pair of disabled lovers forced apart and ridiculed after the woman becomes pregnant.

Disability charities yesterday welcomed the plotline, saying it highlights how far society has come since the judgmental 1950s in which the programme is set.

The episode will feature Sally Harper who is pregnant and has Down¿s Syndrome and Jacob Milligan who has cerebral palsy

The episode, which is to be aired on 
Sunday night, will feature the characters of Sally Harper, who has 
Down’s syndrome, and Jacob Milligan, who has cerebral palsy.

The pair live in an institution, having been sent there by their parents – as was common at  the time.

But
 after they fall in love and Sally becomes pregnant, the  couple are 
separated and Sally faces ridicule from her mother and father.

The episode deals with the prejudice and stigma she would have experienced.

Call
 The Midwife is shown on BBC One before the nine o’clock watershed, and 
in the past storylines featuring abortion, incest and infidelity have 
shocked viewers. But yesterday campaigners welcomed the inclusion of 
disability and love as a theme.

The
 character of Sally is played by Sarah Gordy, and Jacob by Colin Young. 
Both actors have the disability that they portray on screen.

Mr
 Young has called for more TV programmes to deal with the issue, saying:
 ‘You don’t see much in the media about people with disabilities and 
relationships. Having a relationship with cerebral palsy isn’t easy. I’d
 like to find a partner and have a family of my own one day.

‘My
 relationships have mostly been with other disabled people because I’ve 
found there’s often a kind of mutual understanding of life,’ he added.

‘Heidi
 told me she wanted to write this episode for a long time,’ he said of 
writer Heidi Thomas, whose brother David had Down’s syndrome and died at
 the age of 15. ‘She wanted to express the difficulty of disabled people
 wanting to find love. I would say attitudes are similar towards sex 
now.’

Call The Midwife is not the first drama to try to tackle the theme of relationships and disability.

Cynthia Miller played by Bryony Hannah, Sally Harper played by Sarah Gordy and Chummy played by Miranda Hart

In
 2012 The Sessions, a film starring John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, told the
 story of a sex surrogate hired by a man who had been left paralysed by 
polio.

And the issue of 
disabled  people being assisted to have  sex divided opinion in 2010 – 
when it emerged that a government scheme was going to pay for a man with
 learning disabilities to visit a prostitute in Amsterdam.

Last
 night a spokesman for disabilities charity Scope said: ‘It’s great to 
see two disabled actors taking centre stage in a well-loved drama like 
Call The  Midwife. The storyline also highlights just how far we have 
come since the 1950s.

‘However,
 many disabled people continue to experience prejudice today, and face 
scrutiny over personal decisions that they make, like sexual 
relationships or starting a family.

‘Hopefully
 as we see more disabled actors and storylines on TV and in the media, 
people will become more comfortable and accepting of disability.’
