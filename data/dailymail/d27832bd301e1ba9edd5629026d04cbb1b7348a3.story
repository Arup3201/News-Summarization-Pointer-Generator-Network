Roy Keane, 43, is accused of launching tirade of abuse at taxi driver Fateh Kerar, 44, after Mr Kerar told football star to 'smile'

A taxi driver who claims to have been subjected to a torrent of abuse during a road rage attack by football star Roy Keane has told how the incident left him 'shaking and terrified'.

Fateh Kerar, 44, claims he was targeted by 43-year-old Keane after he saw the former Manchester United captain sitting in traffic, before leaning out of his window and telling Keane to 'smile'.

Police are tonight investigating the alleged attack, which happened at around 11.30am at a set of traffic lights in the centre of Altrincham, Greater Manchester.

Mr Kerar said the incident began while he was sitting with a female passenger in Hale, where Keane lives, when the pair spotted him sitting in a black Range Rover while staring directly at them.

He said: 'We were both saying 'that's Roy Keane' but he was just glaring back at us, looking really angry. I said 'hello' to him, then said 'smile'.

'He drove behind us going into Altrincham and as we got to the traffic lights he stopped beside us and turned to us still looking really angry.

'He got out of his car in the middle of the road, held two fingers up and walked out in front of me. He was pointing and swearing and being very aggressive. 

'He shouldn't be allowed to treat people that way. There were lots of people stood around who couldn't believe what they were seeing.'

Passenger Hothan Isman, 38, said: 'He was staring aggressively at the driver - I was saying 'wow, he's really staring at you'. He would turn away then turn back and keep staring.

'When we got to the traffic lights he turned and stopped the car. He got out and was gesticulating with his arms and shouting furiously.

Mr Kerar said Keane followed him in his black Range Rover while staring at him, then climbed out at this junction and began swearing and making obscene gestures 

Police say they are investigating the incident which occurred at 11.30am in Altrincham, Greater Manchester 

'The driver looked terrified and was shaking quite badly. I said he should call the police because it was very nasty, unpleasant, aggressive behaviour.'

The alleged rant was witnessed by stunned onlookers near the Unicorn pub at the junction of Lloyd Street and Railway Street in Altrincham town.

Keane, was allegedly seen swearing and making obscene gestures through the window of the taxi before getting in his car and driving away.

Just hours after the incident Keane launched a foul-mouthed tirade at a reporter who tried to ask him about the alleged incident. 

He said to the journalist: 'What are you talking about?'

'What are you saying? Believe what you want - I can tell what you want from me, you just want a quote.

'Now get the f*** away from me. Get the f*** away from me, now.'

A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman confirmed the force is now investigating.

She said: 'At 11.30am this morning, Friday 30 January 2015, police were called to Ashley Road, Altrincham to a report that a man had behaved aggressively towards another man.

'An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident.'

Roy Keane quit his role as Aston Villa's assistant manager in November but continued in his position as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team.

He represented Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Celtic during a 26-year playing career and made 67 appearances for the Republic of Ireland.

After retiring, he managed Sunderland from 2006 to 2008 and Ipswich Town from 2009 to 2011.

As a player, Keane injured himself trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds in 1997.

Notorious hard-man Keane made 300 appearances for Manchester United as a player, and was once captain. He quit as assistant coach of Aston Villa recently after an alleged bust-up with players  

As a player Keane once injured himself while trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds. Years later, Keane injured Haaland's with a tackle of his own, admitting it was an act of revenge in his biography

Haaland initially accused him of feigning injury. Four years later, Haaland claimed Keane effectively ended his career, after a reckless tackle during a Premier League match in 2001.

Keane was again the subject of a major controversy when after arriving in Asia for the 2002 World Cup, he voiced his disapproval of the team's poor training facilities at the Irish camp in Saipan.

In front of the entire Irish side, during a routine team meeting, he berated Mick McCarthy, then manager of the Irish side.

He was later sent home and played no part in the rest of Ireland's World Cup campaign.

Last year there were reports that Keane - following his departure from Aston Villa - had turned up at footballer Tom Cleverley's house to confront the midfielder over claims a bust-up with players led to him leaving the club.

The club's manager Paul Lambert later insisted the incident had not unfolded in the way it was reported.
