Kevin Pietersen has almost certainly played his last Test for England, with the rockiest marriage of convenience in sport now considered beyond repair.

In the wake of their 5-0 Ashes defeat, coach Andy Flower and captain Alastair Cook are set to be backed by the incoming managing director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, as they begin the task of regaining the urn in 2015.

Unless the positions of Flower, Cook and the team management change drastically, that will mean the end of the nine-year run of an extraordinary soap opera starring the South African-born maverick, whose career has been touched by batting of sheer brilliance but who has polarised opinion like few others in the history of the game.

Over and out: Kevin Pietersen's career with England could be over with the batsman out of form and favour

Home soil: Pietersen was back in England on Sunday watching Chelsea's game with Manchester United

Interest: Pietersen was keen to take photos at Stamford Bridge, taking his mind off events in Australia

Irresponsible: Pietersen has been accused of batting without consideration for the team

Attempt at redemption: Alastair Cook and Andy Flower will lead England's future plans and they don't include KP

Immediately after the end of the grim whitewash in Sydney, Flower denied reports that he believed Pietersen’s batting for the majority of the tour had been so irresponsible and his behaviour behind the scenes so divisive that he had issued Downton with an ultimatum stating either the 33-year-old went or he would.

May 2005: Overlooked for Test series against Bangladesh, but named in England’s 25-man development squad and one-day squad.

July 2005: Scores 57 and 64 on Test debut but Australia crush England by 239 runs.

March 2006: Fined 30 per cent of his match fee for dissent after his dismissal in the first Test against India.

Jan 2007: England’s top scorer in Australia - but the Ashes are lost 5-0.

May 2007: Posts his then highest score of 226 in the second Test against the West Indies at Headingley.

Aug 2008: Replaces Michael Vaughan as Test captain and scores century in debut innings as skipper against South Africa.

Jan 2009: Reports of a rift between Pietersen and coach Peter Moores surface and Pietersen resigns after just three Tests in charge. Moores is sacked.

July 2009: With England leading the Ashes 1-0 after two Tests, Pietersen is ruled out of the rest of the series because of an Achilles injury.

Dec 2010: New career-best 227 in Adelaide during England’s triumphant Ashes campaign.

July 2011: Passes 6,000 Test runs with third Test double hundred against India at Lord’s.

Aug 2012: Allegations made that he sent derogatory text messages about Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower to the South African dressing room. Dropped for third Test.

In truth, no such threat was necessary. For the powers that be had already determined that they should support Flower and the methods he has employed while helping them reach No 1 in the world and achieve three Ashes series wins on the trot, based largely on a team ethic that Pietersen has never felt able to buy into with genuine commitment.

Cook, himself under increasing pressure following England’s dismal start to the one-day series against Australia amid his own poor batting form, is also understood to be fully supportive of Flower’s reported position.

The captain was chiefly responsible for re-integrating Pietersen after the summer Test series against South Africa in 2012 ended with England’s South African-born batsman being dropped after the emergence of texts he had sent to ‘close friends’ in the opposing dressing room, thought to be critical of then captain Andrew Strauss as well as Flower. While the Zimbabwean coach was less enthusiastic, he felt it necessary to back Cook as he took over after Strauss quit at the end of the affair.

The uneasy peace between the pair survived on the back of England’s series win in India, in which Pietersen’s masterful century in the second Test in Mumbai was crucial, and their 3-0 Ashes victory last summer.

But it has finally ended in the breakdown of a relationship characterised by barely disguised mutual distrust and a lack of personal respect, dating back to when Pietersen took over as England captain in 2008.

Emboldened by a perception that, by persuading his players to return to India following the terrorist atrocity in Mumbai he had earned a blank cheque to manage the team his way, Pietersen called for the sacking not only of coach Peter Moores but his then assistant, Flower. Some were certain he wanted his long-term mentor and fellow South African, Graham Ford, installed instead.

Pietersen quit and Moores was sacked, after which Pietersen was said to be considering his future and seemed reluctant to accept the new regime Flower forged with new captain Strauss. He spent much of the 2009 Test series in West Indies under a cloud of indifference and missed the last three Tests of that summer’s victory over Australia with injury.

Glory days: In August last year Pietersen and his teammates were celebrating their third Ashes win in a row

Not so bad: Pietersen had the second highest average of England's batsmen after the five Ashes Tests Down Under, but that's a dubious honour considering it's 29.4 which put him just ahead of Aussie bowler Johnson

But, while Pietersen played his full 
part in England’s rise under Strauss and the historic Ashes win in 
2010-11, more issues arose concerning his injured achilles tendon and 
recurring knee problems, including a feeling that they were badly 
managed by England.

Frustration
 that opportunities to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League have 
been curtailed by England’s insistence on retaining their players for 
the early summer home Test series has grown steadily and it boiled over 
in his brief retirement from one-day international cricket in 2012, 
apparently accepted by Flower and England with something less than 
reluctance.

At the same
 time it has become increasingly evident that Pietersen no longer has 
any time for the technical advice of Flower or batting coach Graham 
Gooch. Pietersen’s one-to-one net practice has comprised throw-downs 
supplied by former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed.

Some insiders go so far as to suggest 
some of Pietersen’s behaviour on the current tour - during which his 
supporters, Michael Vaughan and Shane Warne, were vocal in their 
criticism of Cook and Flower - may have been fuelled by his desire to be
 given a second chance at the captaincy.

Even before the Ashes began, Warne, a 
firm friend and ally, argued in print that the England team could make 
progress only with Pietersen in charge. Vaughan has subsequently called 
for him to be appointed vice-captain.

Backers: Aussie spin legend Shane Warne, also a friend of the controversial batsman, is highly critical of Cook's captaincy, while former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Pietersen should be vice-captain

Bunny: Fired-up Aussie quick Peter Siddle marked his 10th dismissal of KP at the recent Ashes Test in Perth

Inner sanctum: Pietersen's net sessions now amount to little more than throw downs from Mushtaq Ahmed

Pietersen has been included in England’s preliminary 30-man squad for the upcoming World T20 in Bangladesh and they may feel he can offer them an option in the shorter form of the game for some time to come, or at least until the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

But, with Flower insisting all players play for their county clubs at the start of the summer in order to show their willingness to fight to retain their places, many eyes will be on next month’s IPL draft.

If Pietersen, who has not been retained by Delhi Daredevils, makes himself available to other franchises for the full six weeks of the tournament rather than just the first three weeks, that would go against  Flower’s stipulation on playing for his county.

Some within the management are also mindful that the first series of the home summer is against Sri Lanka, now coached by Ford, with whom Pietersen remains in regular touch.

Both Flower and Gooch have said that life in England’s new era may get worse before it gets better, which some have taken as a clear indication of the pain they may have to suffer without Pietersen’s runs in the short term.

Ramp it up: KP shows his innovation for the Delhi Daredevils, the IPL side which has dropped all of it's players

Protocol: Flower wants England Test players to appear for their counties at the start of the summer - in Pietersen's case, Surrey - however the batsman's yet to decide if he'll make himself for the new IPL season

In the frame: Pietersen has been named in the squad for this year's Twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh

He could be given the option to retire from Test cricket, with long-held and deep-seated concerns over how long his knee would allow him to play all formats of international and IPL cricket anyway.

He has restated his desire to carry on playing for England at Test level and to achieve his goal of scoring 10,000 Test runs. But former skipper David Gower, highly critical of what he described as Pietersen putting his ego before the needs of the team in Australia, spoke for many when he told The Mail On Sunday last week: ‘A lot of Kevin’s public pronouncements have tended to have the air of  something constructed to please those who are listening rather than necessarily all coming from the heart or all being true.

‘If these latest stories of Kevin being divisive and disruptive in the dressing room are true, England face an agonising choice because potentially they will be losing a very fine player.’

For better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, it seems the choice has already been made.
