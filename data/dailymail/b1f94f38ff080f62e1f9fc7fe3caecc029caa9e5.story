Supporters of a Texas double murderer slated to by executed next month for two 1992 slayings are petitioning the sate to commute his sentence to life in prison.

Scott Panetti, who wore a cowboy outfit as he represented himself at his 1995 trial where he tried to subpoena Jesus and JFK, was finally given an execution date of December 3 after years of appeals.

On Wednesday, Greg Wiercioch and the schizophrenic 56-year-old's other attorneys asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Rick Perry for a stay of execution,Courthouse News reports.

'The case of Scott Louis Panetti is a judicial disaster that has attracted national and international outrage - and for good reason,' Wiercioch said. 'Evidence of his incompetency runs like a fissure through every proceeding in his case - from arraignment to execution.'

Will he be put to death? On Wednesday, Greg Wiercioch (left) and schizophrenic 56-year-old double murderer Scott Panetti's (right) other attorneys asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Rick Perry for a stay of execution

He said the execution 'would cross a moral line.'

Panetti gunned down his wife's parents as she and their child watched in 1992.

Attorneys say it was the result of a 'psychotic break,' Panetti suffered.

The case has appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court at least three times over the years as his supporters maneuvered to prove he's mentally unfit to be put to death.

The most recent was early in October when the justices refused to review his latest appeal. State attorneys have argued he exaggerates some of his symptoms to avoid execution.

Panetti was convicted of fatally shooting his in-laws, Joe and Amanda Alvarado, at their Fredericksburg home.

Delusional? Attorneys contend Panetti is so delusional that he can't understand why he was convicted and condemned. Here, he's pictured with his mother and father

His wife was living with her parents and a week earlier had obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. 

His wife and 3-year-old daughter, were sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws.

They were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. 

His trial judge assigned Panetti a standby attorney after he chose to be his own lawyer at his 1995 trial, where he wore a purple cowboy outfit, flipped a coin to select a juror and wanted to subpoena Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy as witnesses. He insisted only an insane person could prove insanity.

'Scott Panetti is not competent for execution and therefore his execution would serve no retributive purpose,' his appeals attorney, Greg Wiercioch, said Thursday. 'It is unfortunate that an execution date has been set. 

Always has a bible: Panetti already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He's seen here with his brother

'He has a fixed delusion that Satan, working through the state of Texas, is seeking to execute him for preaching the Gospel. His execution would be a miserable spectacle.'

A day before he was to die in 2007, the Supreme Court stopped Panetti's scheduled execution for further review by lower courts.

I just wanted to see my wife,' Panetti, in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial, explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing. 

'I put on my combat stuff so if I was cornered, I wanted to have my equipment. It was like I wasn't even in control, like someone else was pushing me.' His wife and 3-year-old daughter, sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws, were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities.

Horrific crime: Panetti, at right on a horse with his wife and child, murdered his in-laws as his wife and daughter were splattered with their blood in 1992

During jury selection at his trial, he flipped a coin to decide whether a juror should be put on his panel, fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself. 

He submitted an initial witness list that sought 200 subpoenas, including Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy.

 He showed up for court dressed in cowboy clothing that mimicked Western B-movie star Tom Mix, complete with a big cowboy hat dangling on a string across his back.

He took the stand in the identity of 'Sarge,' speaking in staccato non-sentences: 'Boom, boom, blood, blood.' Jurors rejected his defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, convicted him and sentenced him to death.

Panetti had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s. He worked as a ranchhand — his occupation on prison documents is listed as blacksmith — and already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years.

He told lawyers his scheduled punishment was part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the gospel.

At a federal evidentiary hearing, defense medical experts said while he understood he was to be executed, he did not connect the murders as the reason for the punishment. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stop the execution, but the Supreme Court subsequently agreed to consider his case.
