Health experts are calling for a 7p-a-can ‘fat tax’ on sugary soft drinks to tackle the rising menace of childhood obesity.

A powerful alliance of 61 organisations, including the country’s most eminent doctors and the Royal Society for Public Health, wants the move to be announced in the spring Budget.

The experts argue that the 20p-a-litre levy on bottles and cans of fizzy drinks could help cut consumption in the same way that tax is used to deter smoking and drinking.

Crackdown: Experts claim adding 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of fizzy drink will cut consumption and help tackle childhood obesity

The move, which would add nearly 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, would raise £1billion a year to promote healthier eating.

The alliance has been brought together by Sustain, the campaigning food and health group. The Prime Minister has indicated some sympathy for the idea in the past.

Sustain campaigns director Charlie Powell said: ‘Sugar-laden drinks are mini health timebombs, contributing to dental diseases, obesity and a host of life-threatening illnesses which cost the NHS billions each year.’

Most of the money raised through the levy would be ring-fenced for a Children’s Future Fund, which would be spent on improving children’s health by, for example, providing free school meals or free fruit and vegetable snacks.

Epidemic proportions: One child in three is already obese or overweight before they leave primary school

An independent body would be given responsibility to oversee how the drinks duty, which would apply to products with added sugar, is implemented and spent.

The initiative has the support of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges, which effectively speaks for the entire medical profession.

Dr Mike Rayner, of the Department of 
Public Health at Oxford University, said: ‘Just as we use fiscal 
measures to discourage drinking and smoking and help prevent people from
dying early, there is now lots of evidence that the same approach would
work for food.

‘This modest
proposal goes some way towards making the price of food reflect its 
true costs to society.

'Our obesity epidemic causes debilitating illness,
life-threatening diseases and misery for millions of people. It is high
time government did something effective.’

Britain
is the fattest country in Europe, with one in four adults classed as 
obese while one child in three is already obese or overweight before 
they leave primary school.

Dealing
with diet-related illnesses, such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease,
costs the NHS £6billion a year, predicted to soar to £50billion by 
2050.

Countries such as Finland, France and Hungary, and in some states in the US already impose a tax on unhealthy foods.

France
brought in a duty of 6p a litre on all drinks with added sugar or 
artificial sweeteners a year ago. The tax rises to 40p a litre on energy
drinks.

Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said a fat tax on fizzy drinks would not reduce obesity.

‘Obesity is a serious and complex problem, but a tax on soft drinks, which contribute just two per cent of the total calories in the average diet, will not help address it,’ he said.

‘Over the past ten years, the consumption of soft drinks containing added sugar has fallen by nine per cent while the incidence of obesity has increased by 15 per cent.’
