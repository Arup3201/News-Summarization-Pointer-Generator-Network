Great Britain basketball star Luol Deng has joined the Miami Heat on a two-year deal worth $20million (£11.69m).

Deng heads to the 2012 and 2013 NBA champions after just six months with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who he joined in January this year.

However, with LeBron James returning to Cleveland after four years in Miami, Deng has gone in the other direction.

Deng is 
entering his 11th season in the NBA having spent almost his entire career with
 the Chicago Bulls. He played in 40 games with the Cavaliers
 after his trade last season.

He also represented Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The 29-year-old has averaged 16.0 points per game in his career after being chosen as the No 7 overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft from Duke.

Deng's contract with Miami should be signed this week.
