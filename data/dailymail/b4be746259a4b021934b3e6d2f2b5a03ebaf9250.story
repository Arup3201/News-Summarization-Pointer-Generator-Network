Convicted: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was found guilty of murder by a court martial in November

A Royal Marine who murdered a wounded Afghan fighter in cold blood has failed in his attempt to overturn the conviction.

But sergeant Alexander Blackman - who fired a pistol into the man's chest with the words 'shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***' - had his sentence reduced by two years.

Three leading judges decided that combat stress suffered by Blackman, 39, should have been given more weight, and cut the time he would have to serve in jail from ten years to eight.

The soldier was convicted by a court martial Bulford, Wiltshire in November. He was originally known as Marine A, but the High Court ruled that his name should be released when he was first sentenced.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Brian Leveson and Lady Justice Hallett, giving their ruling in London, said that the particular stresses affecting Blackman should have been 'accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor'.

Allowing an appeal against sentence, Lord Thomas said: 'On all the evidence before us it is clear that in the events surrounding the murder of the insurgent, the appellant acted entirely out of character and was suffering from combat stress disorder'.

As well as the life sentence Blackman, now 39, was 'dismissed with disgrace' from the Royal Marines after he had served with distinction for 15 years, including tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland.

The killing happened in Helmand province in 2011 while Blackman, who is known as Al, was serving with Plymouth-based 42 Commando.

Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing

He shot the Afghan, who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter, in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol before. He referenced Shakespeare's Hamlet as the man convulsed and died in front of him.

Blackman said: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us'.

He then turned to comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention'.

His younger colleagues were cleared of any wrongdoing. Known as Marines B and C during the trial, they were later named as Corporal Christopher Watson and Marine Jack Hammond.

The shooting was captured on a camera mounted on Cpl Watson's helmet. Blackman, who denied murder, said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse.

Wife: Clair Blackman was at the High Court today for the result of the appeal

Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty

He has said he felt ashamed, describing the killing as a 'stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment'.

Reducing the minimum term, Lord Thomas said: 'It is very unfortunate that the only medical evidence before the court martial and before us was obtained over two years after the murder.

'We have accorded particular attention to the view of the court martial that thousands of other service personnel experienced the same or similar stresses and still acted properly and humanely.

Blackman: Right, get him closer so PGSS can't see what we're doing to him.

Unknown: (Place/push) him in there, come on.

Blackman: Get him right in.

Unknown: Come on.

Blackman: Over by that corn.

LATER

Marine D: Do you want him back in?

Blackman: Yeah, I want, I want him in this area so I can see what the f*** (we're/ I'm) doing.

Blackman: Anybody want to do first aid on this idiot?

Unknown: No.

Marine B: No.

Marine C: I'll put one in his head, if you want.

Blackman: No, not in his head, cause that'll be f***ing obvious.

Unknown: Just move him round here.

Marine B: Going to switch this f***ing off (camera).

LATER

Marine B: For f***'s sake, I cannot believe I'm doing this.

Marine C: Wait a minute, just present to do it tiLl he's behind them trees.

Unknown: Just strangle him.

LATER

(Gun shot)

Unknown: (What was that?)

Unknown: (Don't know.)

Blackman: There you are, shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***.

Blackman: It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.

Marine B: I know.

Blackman: Obviously, this doesn't go anywhere fellas.

Marine B: Yeah, roger, mate.

Blackman: I've just broken the Geneva convention.

Marine B: Yeah, roger.

Blackman: Biometric data module, right, er, try and brush some of that s*** off his face.

Marine B: If anything gets heard, mate, it's as a warning shot went down.

'However, in assessing the evidence of stress and its effect on the appellant, we attach particular importance to the evidence in relation to the remoteness of the command post at which the appellant had been stationed for five and a half months and the limited contact with those commanding him.

'His mental welfare had not been assessed in the way in which it would ordinarily be assessed by a commanding officer and there is evidence that he was becoming somewhat paranoiac about the Taliban's "gunning" for him'.

The judge added: 'Taking into account the whole of the evidence, we conclude that combat stress arising from the nature of the insurgency in Afghanistan and the particular matters we have identified as affecting him ought to have been accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor'.

Lord Thomas announced: "On that basis we have therefore concluded that although he remains subject to a sentence of imprisonment for life, the minimum term which he must serve before being considered for parole should be reduced to eight years.

'His release will then depend on the Parole Board and, even thereafter, he will remain subject to the terms of the conditions of his licence. To that extent and to that extent only is this appeal allowed'.

Referring to the 'aggravating' features of the case, Lord Thomas said the first related to the circumstances of the shooting as found proved by the court martial.

'These included four deliberate acts. These were, first, the appellant's decision to stop first aid; second, the appellant's order to move the insurgent to a place where what he intended to do would not be seen; third, the discharge of the round into the insurgent's chest; and fourth, the instruction to the patrol to say nothing about what had happened'.

Lord Thomas said: 'True it may be that there may have been other insurgents in the vicinity, but that played no causative effect in the appellant's decision to fire at the wounded insurgent and kill him'.

The second aggravating feature 'was the deliberate involvement by the appellant of soldiers who looked to him for leadership in a dishonest cover up of what had happened and the construction of the account that the insurgent was already dead'.

Lord Thomas said: 'Third was the appellant's failure to follow, both personally as a soldier and, furthermore, as the person in command of the patrol, the standards of conduct which represented the values for which HM Forces had been sent to Afghanistan'.

An MoD spokesman said after the ruling: 'We respect the authority and decision of the appeal court, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the sentence'.
