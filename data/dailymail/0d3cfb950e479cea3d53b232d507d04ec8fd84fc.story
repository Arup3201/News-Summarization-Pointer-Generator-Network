Keys belonging to missing student Shane Montgomery have been found in a river close to where he was last seen, his family has revealed.

Montgomery, a 21-year-old student at West Chester University, left a bar in Manayunk, Pennsylvania in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot - but has not been seen since.

His disappearance  sparked a massive hunt and the offer of a $65,000 reward but searches, which have mostly focused on the Manayunk Canal, have so far turned up nothing.

But on Sunday, divers searched the nearby Schuylkill River and found his keys in the water just south of the parking lot, his mother told the Philadelphia Daily News.  

Clue: Keys belonging to Shane Montgomery, pictured, have been found in the Schuylkill River, close to where he was last seen on November 27. He vanished after leaving a bar following a night of drinking

'My heart is broken,' Karen Montgomery said. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home.' 

His uncle Kevin Verbrugghe, told WPVI that the keys, which were on a Philadelphia Eagles lanyard, definitely belonged to his nephew because he tested them in Montgomery's front door.

But there is still no sign of the student. 

'It's just a piece to the puzzle,' Verbrugghe told WPVI. 'The puzzle is definitely not done.'

Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table.

Last seen: The student was seen on surveillance footage crossing a footbridge, pictured, over the Manayunk Canal on November 27 - although the actual footage has not yet been released by police

Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters

He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. 

The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it.

One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave.

Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning.

The footage has been withheld by authorities. 

Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, has this Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder

Questions: His distraught parents, Karen and Kevin, have said they are thankful for everyone's prayers

Search: Teams searched the nearby canal last month but turned up no signs of Montgomery there

The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him. 

He is 5ft11 and 130lb, with short brown hair and green eyes. He was wearing a buttoned-down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar. He has a Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder. 

His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.'

A $65,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his whereabouts. Anyone with information is asked to contact Philadelphia Police Northwest Detectives at 215-686-3353.
