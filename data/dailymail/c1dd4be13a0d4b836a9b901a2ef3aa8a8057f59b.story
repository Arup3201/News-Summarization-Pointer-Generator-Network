Reading are leading the race for Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah.

Sportsmail reported on Tuesday that Watford and Ipswich had also made enquiries for the 20-year-old but Steve Clarke looks to have persuaded the Engalnd Under 21 international to join him at the Madejski Stadium.

Chalobah was poised to join Bordeaux on loan but was prevented by the FIFA three-club rule which determined he had already played for Chelsea and Burnley and could not join another top flight side.

Nathaniel Chalobah is looking for a loan move after his spell at Burnley came to an abrupt end

Chalobah has 21 caps for the England Under 21 side, and has also played for the Under 16, 17 and 19 sides

The young midfielder only made four appearances for Burnley while on loan and appeared for Chelsea's Under 21 side but they were deemed competitive games. 

Watford had Chalobah on loan in 2012 and are keen to give him a run of games as they bid to go up to the Premier League. 

Ipswich are better placed as they lie second in the Championship while Reading have a lot more ground to make up as Steve Clarke looks to ensure they move clear of the relegation zone first.

The 20-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and Jose Mourinho will be keen for Chalobah to sign for a club where he will play first-team football for the second half of the season.
