Rupert Murdoch was mocked on Twitter for 'hypocrisy' after he said two scandal-hit politicians running for office was 'unbelievable'

Rupert Murdoch has been ridiculed on Twitter after Tweeting that he thought contrition is 'out of date'.

The media mogul said that he could not believe that two disgraced New York politicians were running for public office once more.

But Twitter users seized on his own troubles and his long history of being ruthless in his business dealings to mock him.

Murdoch, 82, recently filed for divorce from his third wife Wendi Deng without apparently notifying her of his intentions.

MPs have also asked him to return to Parliament to answer more questions over the phone hacking scandal after he was secretly recorded saying that payments to police happened all the time.

Murdoch was talking about shamed New York politicians Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner when he made his comments.

Weiner is running for mayor of the city despite having to resign from his Congressional seat in 2011 due to a sexting scandal.

Spitzer was governor of New York until 2008 when he was forced out after being caught using high class prostitutes.

He is now running for comptroller of New York which would put him in charge of the city's finances and pensions.

Murdoch wrote: 'Almost unbelievable. Both Spitzer and Weiner running for office.

'Contrition apparently out of date.'

The response was immediate with some Twitter users saying that 'could not stop laughing'.

User Lucas Shaw Tweeted: 'Says the man going through a divorce' whilst Richard Pacher said: 'Where is yours sir?'

Allan Brauer wrote: 'Remind us all of the time lapse between each of your divorces and remarriages, Rupert?' whilst Jen Chung said: 'Look who's talking!'

Despite his reputation, Murdoch recently showed his more sensitive side after launching an investigation to find the Sun reporter who secretly recorded him during a meeting to address their concerns about the way staff had been treated over phone hacking.

The newspaper's editor David Dinsmore has supposedly revealed to colleagues that in a phone call from America Murdoch said that he felt 'hurt by what has happened'.

It was during that meeting that Murdoch said that payments to police were part of 'the culture of Fleet Street'.

Scotland Yard is now looking at the recording as part of Operation Elveden, its investigation into illegal payments to public officials.
