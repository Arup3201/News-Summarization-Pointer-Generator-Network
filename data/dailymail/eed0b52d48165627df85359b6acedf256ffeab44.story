It's not exactly the way you would expect a serious news programme to finish.

Not content with a simple ‘goodbye’, BBC presenter Kirsty Wark instead ended last night’s edition of Newsnight with a dance – because it was Halloween.

Miss Wark, 58, surprised viewers by joining ten dancers to perform part of the routine to Michael Jackson’s hit Thriller.

The presenter got well and truly in to the spirit of Halloween and performed the famous dance 1983 Michael Jackson routine along with ten theatre students who joined her live in the studio.

Following a package about the Chilean dictator Pinochet where his spokesman admitted ‘atrocities’ were committed, broadcaster Kirsty Wark got in to character and began to dance.

The 58-year-old newscaster said: ‘That’s just about all from this Hallowe’en night. Be careful out there, goodnight.’ 

While Twitter users loved the segment, nut the flagship BBC programme has been accused of dumbing down recently

Many viewers took to Twitter to express their surprise at what they were seeing. One user wrote: ‘I WONDERED why Kirsty Wark was wearing such heavy eye makeup on Newsnight! Now I understand’ while another wrote: ‘Oh come on, this is brilliant. Kirsty Wark signs off October 31st.

While Twitter users gave a generally postive response, the flagship BBC programme has been accused of dumbing down recently.

Michael Jackson's Thriller music video was released in 1983

And last night’s performance was certainly a far cry from when the show used to end with a stockmarket report before being replaced with a weather forecast.

This is not the first time Mrs Wark has attracted attention for non-news related matters. In 2010 came under fire for wearing revealing outfits, including a black dress slashed almost all the way up to her waist.
