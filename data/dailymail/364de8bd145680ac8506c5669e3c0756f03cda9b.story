Plagued by  excruciating cystitis, Lauren Sutcliffe is too scared to leave the house, struggles to hold down a job and dreads having sex with her boyfriend.

The 23-year-old says she feels as though she has 'paper cuts and acid inside' - and that the pain is 'unbearable'.

She is one of 400,000 people in the country, the majority of them women, who suffer with a chronic form of the bladder condition, known by its medical name interstitial cystitis (IC).

For 12 years ,Lauren Sutcliffe has suffered interstitial cystitis - a chronic form of the bladder condition - leaving her unable to leave the house or hold down a job because of painful flare ups

The symptoms - including pain, urgency, a need to pass water frequently and a burning sensation when passing urine - are similar to standard cystitis.

Cystitis is linked to infection, but interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall, which can follow childbirth, surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections, though sometimes there is no known cause.

While it’s more common in women over 40, it can affect younger women, too.

Miss Sutcliffe, from Sunderland, has suffered the condition since she was 11 years old, having been plagued by kidney and bladder problems since birth.

The chronic bladder infections have left her in severe pain, and facing a constant urge to go to the toilet.

She struggles to hold down a job and her social life has been sacrificed because of her illness.

She claims the side effects from her medication cause anxiety, hair loss and early menopause, which means she cannot have children.

After 12 years of enduring regular painful bouts of cystitis, Miss Sutcliffe was finally diagnosed with the chronic form of the condition earlier this year.

But she is yet to find an effective medication to ease her condition.

Unfortunately, patients are frequently misdiagnosed as simply being prone to urinary infections.

This means they are given antibiotics, which - because there is no infection - do not solve the problem.

The former University of Sunderland student said: 'It feels like there are paper cuts and acid inside me and the pain is unbearable.

'During a flare leaving the house isn't even an option.

After the 23-year-old's social life suffered, her sister bought her a dog, Claude, last year to help her through her illness. She said: 'I strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like I do'

Interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area.

Like regular cystitis, IC sufferers experience an urgency and frequent need to urinate.

But the condition doesn't respond to treatment with antibiotics, because it is not caused by a bacterial infection.

Around 400,000 people in the UK suffer the condition. More than 90 per cent of these cases are in women.

The condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40.

What causes IC?

Researchers are not clear on the causes of the condition. There is a school of thought that believes the illness is inherited.

It is also thought to be linked to other conditions including irritiable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. 

Another theory is that one of the protective layers of the bladder wall may 'leak' in people with IC, allowing chemicals in the urine to irritate the bladder. 

People with IC often have small areas of scarring, stiffness or bleeding on the wall of their bladder.

Lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms

It is possible to reduce the symptoms by making some lifestyle changes.

How is IC treated?

There is no single treatment, with each sufferer finding different therapies helpful.

Treatments include:

'I rarely want or initiate sex with my boyfriend because it's so painful, I know I'll suffer afterwards.

'My illness definitely takes its toll on our relationship, but luckily he is extremely understanding.

'I've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness.

'I wonder will I ever find a job that will accommodate my chronic agony and everything that comes with it.'

As well as suffering with IC, Lauren also lives with endometriosis and vulvodynia - a persistent and unexplained pain in the vulva, the skin surrounding the vagina - which add to her agony.

'IC makes me feel completely useless so I suffer with severe depression and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder [clinical depression] in 2012,' said Miss Sutcliffe.

'I've received counselling from a psychologist to help me accept my conditions and to help me live with the chronic pain.

'But that along with the eight medications I take per day hasn't provided much comfort.'

Bladder and kidney infections are a regular occurrence for the IC sufferer, but this year alone Miss Sutcliffe has had a flare up every month.

As a result of her condition, her education has also been sacrificed as she was too afraid to make the journey to college in case she desperately needed to toilet.

She said: 'There are so many girls who are too embarrassed to speak out about IC but it's so common and awareness needs to be raised.

'There's so many support groups and foundations that are there to give support.'

A Cystitis and Overactive Bladder Foundation spokesperson said: 'IC is a chronic condition and there is no cure.

'Sufferers can need to urinate up to 40 times in a 24-hour period and the pain is excruciating.

'Many sufferers suffer exhaustion, anxiety and depression as a result of the disease - some are even suicidal. 

'We provide sufferers with information on the various treatments available to alleviate symptoms and support. 

 'We also run local groups around the country so that sufferers can meet others with the disease and know that they are not alone.'

Miss Sutcliffe is now hoping to raise awareness about her condition.

She has found support at the Facebook group IC Sisters, where she talks to women all over the world who share their advice and stories with each other.

The condition causes Miss Sutcliffe to suffer regular, painful bouts of cystitis - at least once a month. She said: 'I've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness'

'It's nice to know you're not alone and that there are other people going through the same thing. It definitely brings some comfort and helps during a bad day,' Miss Sutcliffe said.

 After Miss Sutcliffe's condition destroyed her social life, her sister bought her a Bichon Frise puppy, Claude last year.  

She said: 'My illness takes its toll not only on me but on my whole family.

'I strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like I do.

'He's my best friend and he instantly makes me feel calmer when I'm struggling.' 

September is Interstitial Cystitis awareness month and support groups are encouraging sufferers to speak out.
