A doctor has launched the first clinic in the country offering facials - for your derriere.

Using peels, laser therapy and moisturising techniques, the £300 treatments are being offered due to stars such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna proudly parading their derrieres in 'belfies' or 'bottom selfies' across social media.

Dr Carlos Xavier said that there have already been dozens of both men and women queueing up to undergo one of the treatments, which can even be offered during a lunch hour.

Stars like Kim Kardashian and Kelly Brook (R) proudly parading their derrieres in 'belfies' or 'bottom selfies' across social media are thought to be why there is increased demand for bottom facials 

He said the treatments promise to rejuvenate and enhance posteriors and are the first of their kind in the UK.

The Ultimate Butt Facial - available at Natura Anti-Ageing Clinic in Manchester - uses the latest peels, lasers and moisturising treatments to polish your posterior to perfection.

Bosses said the treatment, tailored to the individual, can be done in a lunch time, leaving your buns toned, polished, radiant and camera ready, with minimal downtime.

Dr Carlos Xavier, who carries out the treatments, says it is becoming increasingly popular.

Judith Liriano, 21, had the procedure done to rid her bottom of cellulite, dimples, and dark spots in America (left before, right, after) and she couldn't be happier with the results

He said: 'I first carried this treatment out in the USA, now it's caught on at my clinic here and why not? We use these treatments to great effect on our faces and other areas; this treatment works just as well on our bottoms. It can help target cellulite, skin issues and enhance the tone and appearance of your skin. I'm expecting a peak in demand as people head for the sun this winter.'

Sarah Thompson 28, a PA from Manchester, is a fan of Natura's Butt Facial: 'I love it, I've always had facial treatments and I don't see this as any different. 

'It used to be all about how your breasts looked, but my bum is my best asset and deserves looking after; now it's really smooth and healthier looking, I'm much happier and more confident too.'

Judith Liriano gets a chemical peel from Amanda Sanzone as part of getting her $500 (£300) butt facial at Dr. Matthew Schulman's plastic surgery office in New York, where bottom facials are already popular

Registered with the General Medical Council for over twenty five years, Dr Xavier has more than thirty years medical experience, including anaesthetics, is a member of the British Association of Cosmetic Doctors; the American Society of Laser Surgery and Medicine and the International Dermoscopy Society.

Already established in America, a treatment in New York costs roughly the same as in the UK.

But despite the hefty price tag, increasing numbers of Americans are jumping on the butt facial bandwagon.

Judith Liriano, 21, had the procedure done to rid her bottom of cellulite, dimples, and dark spots and she couldn't be happier with the results.

Speaking about the treatment, Judith said: 'Every girl wants to feel confident when they're on the beach - before I tried the booty facial, I wasn't as confident as I am now. I don't think you could put a price tag on looking good and feeling good.'
