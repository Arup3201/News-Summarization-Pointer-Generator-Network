The relentless barrage of freezing weather and snow storms hitting most of the U.S. may seem like more of a hassle than a winter wonderland, but there are some perks to the bitter cold.

Freezing temperatures have created the perfect conditions to visit Wisconsin's Apostle Islands caves, accessed by walking a mile out onto a iced-over Lake Superior.

For the first time in five years, visitors are able to explore the island's caves which have been turned into a 'fairyland of needle-like icicles' thanks to that polar vortex.

Frozen over: For the first time in five years, visitors can trek a mile out onto Lake Superior to explore the Apostle Islands' caves covered in ice

Rare opportunity: Not since the winter of 2009 have conditions been right to make the journey from shore to the islands safe enough to cross on foot

Winter wonderland: In the cold months, the islands' caves become a 'fairyland of needle-like icicles'

The caves are a popular destination during the summer when they can be accessed by kayak, but they're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend.

'The formations we are seeing this year are some of the best I've ever seen,' Neil Howk, assistant chief of interpretation with the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, told WDIO.

'People love coming out here in the summer because the cliffs and the caves are just beautiful, but this time of year...it's incredible,' Mr Howk added.

Popular destination: The park gets about 1,000 visitors a weekend when the caves are open during the winter, much more than in summer

Safety first: Visitors make the trek wearing cleets, snow shoes or skis so as not to slip

Solid ice: Park officials closely monitor the ice conditions to make sure the crossing is safe

Exceptional year: Neil Howk, who works with the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, said the ice formations this year are 'some of the best I've ever seen

When the thaw comes: The caves are accessed in the summer by kayak

Visual tricks; The caves appear to be covered in beautiful rock formations that are actually stalactites and stalagmites made entirely of ice

'For most people, walking on a frozen Great Lake is just a remarkable experience psychologically, let alone physically,' park superintendent Bob Krumanaker told Wisconsin Public Radio.

'It's pretty solid generally and depending on the visibility it could be as white as far as you can see. But you know the lake is under it and sometimes you can even feel the ice move a  little bit.'

Krumanaker describes the interior of the caves, saying they are covered with what looks to be beautiful rock formations but in reality is stalactites and stalagmites made entire of ice.

GPS: The caves are located 18 miles east of Bayfield, Wisconsin

Like glass: Park superintendent Bob Krumanaker says you can see straight to the bottom of the lake in some parks of the caves

See them while you can: Park officials hope to keep the islands open for another six weeks, but conditions could make them inaccessible as soon as Saturday

Great view: A visitor surveys Lake Superior from one of the caves' entrances

Dog trip: Two dogs play in the snow outside the caves

Superior at sunset: Ice creates an alien landscape on the top of Lake

'And then if you carefully crawl under some of that ... the ice is completely smooth and generally completely clear underneath it. So, it’s like there’s a glass floor that you can see the bottom of the lake,' he said.

The caves are located 18 miles west of Bayfield, Wisconsin. Krumanaker hopes they'll be open for another six weeks, but conditions could make them unreachable soon.
