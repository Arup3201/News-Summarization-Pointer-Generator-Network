New move: David Cameron has backed up his promotion of marriage by introducing a tax break for couples

David Cameron has shown his support for same-sex couples by taking to Twitter to announce gay partners will benefit from new marriage tax breaks.

The Prime Minister has announced plans for married couples to receive a £1,000 tax allowance in recognition of their ‘commitment and responsibility’.

The tax break will be available to gay couples in civil partnerships and – following a change in the law – in marriages.

Taking to Twitter, Mr Cameron wrote: 'The £1000 marriage tax allowance will apply to straight and gay couples, as well as civil partners. Love is love, commitment is commitment.'

In an article for the Daily Mail, the Prime Minister says the transferable allowance will be introduced in 2015.

Stay-at-home mothers and women who work part time will be the main winners. ‘The values of marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – values that we need more of,’ Mr Cameron writes.

‘Marriage is a good thing for our country – it’s the ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our support for it.’

The move, first promised by the Prime Minister when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2005, restores the financial recognition for marriage lost when a similar allowance was phased out in 1999.

Under Mr Cameron’s plans, which he will champion at his party conference next week, a husband or wife will be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse.

Support: Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his backing for same-sex couples to be included in new marriage tax breaks

The Tory 2010 election manifesto promised a figure of only £750.

It will apply to those not using all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children, or work part time and earn less than £10,000. Around eight million people are expected to benefit  – by around £200 a year.

The Liberal Democrats, who object to any special recognition for marriage, will abstain in a vote on the issue, a provision included in the 2010 coalition agreement.

But even if, as expected, Labour opposes the measure it should pass thanks to the votes of Conservative MPs.

It will be confirmed in Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement and introduced from April 2015 – making it a key issue at the general election a few weeks later.

The tax break will not be available to couples that have a higher rate taxpayer which, in 2015, will be those earning more than £42,285.

Mr Cameron’s decision to press ahead will delight most Conservative MPs and polls suggest the move is supported by around two thirds of voters.

The Tories argue that, for 11 years, Labour undermined marriage and financially punished couples where one spouse chooses to stay at home to bring up a family.

The US, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and Norway are among nations that reward the caring role of stay-at-home spouses. However, the tax measure, expected to cost around £600million a year, will provoke controversy at a time of austerity.

It had been put on hold because of the efforts to rein in state spending, and the priority given to the Coalition’s goal of increasing the personal tax allowance for 24million basic rate taxpayers to £10,000 a year.

But Right-wing Tories, including several members of the Cabinet, indicated they wanted action quickly.

The measure may help placate social conservatives uneasy at the Government’s focus on introducing gay marriage, as well as the removal of child benefit from high earners.

Mr Osborne has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women – leading Right-wing Tories to insist it is right for the Government to show support for stay-at-home mothers as well.

Tim Loughton, a Tory former minister who campaigned for the tax break, said: ‘The Government is sending out a very strong signal that marriage and the commitment it demonstrates is good for families, children and society, both socially and financially, and we should not be afraid to stand up for it.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has branded the idea ‘odd’, while Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has complained widows and those abandoned by their partners will be excluded.

Happy? Married couples will be praying the new tax break gets passed through government (posed by models)

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who has driven the party’s policy on backing for marriage, initially proposed a larger tax break costing £3.2billion a year.

But he agreed there should be a staggered introduction of tax allowances because of the catastrophic state of the public finances. In 1999, its final year before it was abolished for all but pensioner couples, the married couples allowance was worth £197 a year.

Marriage is already recognised in both inheritance tax and capital gains tax.

For more than 20 years, the Daily Mail has led calls for marriage to be recognised in the tax system once more.

Alongside the birth of my children, 
my wedding was the happiest day of my life. Since then, Samantha and I 
have been a team. Nothing I’ve done since – becoming a Member of 
Parliament, leader of my party or Prime Minister – would have been 
possible without her.

There
 is something special about marriage: it’s a declaration of commitment, 
responsibility and stability that helps to bind families. The values of 
marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – values that we need 
more of in this country.

Of
 course, governments can’t be in the business of social engineering – 
there is nothing more scary than the prospect of a politician trying to 
do so.

And naturally, there are people across the country who have never  married and are just as committed to each other.

Team: David Cameron credits much of his success at No.10 to his wife Samantha

We
 also know that sadly too many marriages come to an end. But surely we 
can agree with all these things, yet at the same time support something 
which we know can help keep families together.

There
 is good evidence about the positive role that marriage can play: study 
upon study has shown that families  with married couples are less likely
 to break up.

There are
 also many studies about the cost of family breakdown. I am not for one 
minute arguing that marriage is a panacea, of course it isn’t.

But
 the real question is this: because marriage is an institution that 
helps to build a strong society, shouldn’t society properly recognise 
that in the tax system? Other countries do – I think we should too.

That’s
 why when I ran for the leadership of my party back in 2005, I said that
 I wanted to do more for marriage in the tax system: a personal pledge 
that I made right at the start of my campaign – and I then backed that 
up with a pledge in our manifesto at the last election.

So next week at the Conservative Party’s conference in Manchester, I’m going to deliver on the promise I made.

From
 April 2015, if neither of you are higher rate taxpayers, you will be 
able to transfer £1,000 of your tax-free allowance to your spouse.

In
 effect, if you pay the basic rate of tax and your partner doesn’t use 
all of their personal allowance, you’ll be able to have some of it. Most
 couples who benefit will be £200 a year better off as a result.

And of course this will
 be true if  you’re gay or straight – and in a civil partnership or a 
marriage. This summer I was proud to make equal marriage the law. Love 
is love, commitment is commitment.

Proud: David Cameron believes there is something 'very special' about marriage, and that needs rewarding

I’m
 really proud that we’re getting this done. But when you make an 
important change like this, I know that people will have questions.

What’s more, whenever you talk about the family as a politician, it’s all too easy for your opponents to twist your meaning.

Labour
 won’t miss a trick: they will spend the next week peddling false and 
inaccurate myths rather than having a sensible debate.

So
 let’s address a few of the myths that are likely are to spring up. This
 is not about stigmatising unmarried people or single parents:  as I’ve 
already said, you don’t  have to be married to have a family life that 
is rock solid – and we support all families through the tax and benefits
 system.

All we’re 
saying is that marriage is a good thing for our country – it’s the 
ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our 
support for it.

Next, the charge will 
come  up that we’re trying to bribe people to get married. Frankly this 
is  a pretty depressing – and wrong-headed – view of human nature. 
People aren’t going to choose to get married for a few extra pounds each
 week. This policy  isn’t about the money but about the message that 
people who  make a lasting commitment should be recognised in some way.

Finally, Labour will say we’re favouring some families over others. But I’m happy to defend our record any day of the week.

From
 tax-free childcare for every working family to an income  tax cut for 
25million people – from cutting fuel duty to freezing council tax – 
we’re doing something  for all families even in these difficult times.

Compare this to the promises that Labour made to you last week – promises that fell apart within a matter of hours.

From
 tomorrow the Conservative Party will be gathering in Manchester. 
Together we’ll be speaking  to the nation with a clear message – we are 
backing hard-working  people in this country every step of the way. 
Whether you’re young and hungry for your first job or a family tired of 
renting and looking to own your first home, then the Conservative Party 
will help you achieve your dreams.

Supporting marriage is part of that vision for Britain, recognising an institution that is all about commitment.

I’m proud that we’re finally making this happen – and proud that we’re delivering on the promise I made.
