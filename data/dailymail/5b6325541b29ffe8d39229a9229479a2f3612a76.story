Jailed: RAF Corporal Scott Cuckoo was sentenced to 28 months behind bars after importing ecstasy tablets to sell online

An RAF corporal who sold ecstasy tablets online that he had imported between his tours of duty in Afghanistan has been jailed.

Corporal Scott Cuckoo, who was described as an 'impeccable' serviceman, bought the drugs from the Netherlands before selling them on over the internet.

The married 30-year-old faces being dishonourably discharged from the forces after being jailed for 28 months today.

The talented serviceman, described as a high-flyer, first began using ecstasy as a means of coping with what happened to him in Afghanistan, Winchester Crown Court was told.

Disgraced Cuckoo was rumbled when customs officers intercepted three packages from the Netherlands destined for his home address.

They each contained 50 ecstasy tablets and were labelled with the false name 'Mr S Coombes', the court heard.

Police called at his flat in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and the helicopter engineer admitted he had invented the alias and the packages were in fact his.

Officers searched the property and found a further 139 tablets and 26.43g of the drug in powder form. They had a total street value of Â£1,600.

The home was also filled with packaging materials, which were ready to send out to his customers who had ordered online.

They were designed to look like they contained spare parts for machinery.

Prosecutor Rebecca Fairbairn said: 'In April this year, a number of packages were intercepted by the UK Border Force, which were destined for Basingstoke.

'Each package was found to contain around 50 ecstasy tablets and were addressed to a 'Mr S Coombes'.

'The only residents of that address were Mr Cuckoo and his wife. On April 23, the police attended the address to speak to Mr Coombes, and Mr Cuckoo answered the door.

'Officers asked him the whereabouts of Mr Coombes and disclosed what their enquiry was about.

'The defendant made it clear he was involved in the matter and was arrested. A large quantity of ecstasy tablets and powder were found.'

Cuckoo has been in the RAF for ten years and worked as an aircraft engineer, fixing helicopters in Afghanistan.

Some of the helicopters were used to repatriate dead or injured servicemen, and others on Special Forces missions, the court heard.

Cuckoo completed eight tours of Afghanistan and spent seven months there last year alone.

But he has now had to rent out his home and move back in with his parents after his drug dealing business brought his career to an abrupt end.

Nicholas Rowland, mitigating, said: 'His seniors describe him as a highly skilled and motivated serviceman who performed admirably.

'He was held in high regard in the squadron and his performance at home and abroad has been remarkable.

'His commanding officers say he has an impeccable skill set, and had a high-flying career ahead of him. But he got involved in this incredibly foolish enterprise and he has now lost his career.

'He will be dishonourably discharged and his pension will disappear. His personal life has been devastated by what he's done.'

Mr Rowland added: 'Mr Cuckoo started to use ecstasy as a coping mechanism when he returned from Afghanistan.

'From using it as a coping mechanism, he somehow embarked on this project, which he did not need to do for financial reasons.

'He did it to help him cope with depression, which is a rather bizarre reaction to what had happened to him in Afghanistan.

'He saw many things on active service that others could not possibly imagine. Servicemen respond in different ways.'

Judge Jane Miller QC said: 'You were quite clearly a very promising young man and this is a fall from grace.

'What possessed you to start importing drugs from abroad and start dealing, I cannot imagine.'

Cuckoo fought back tears as he was led from the dock to the cells. He admitted one charge of possession of ecstasy with intent to supply.
