An aspiring beauty queen won't let a pack of girls competing for judges' attention put her off - because she's used to a good scrum on the rugby pitch.

Selina Singleton, 16, from Rugby, Warwickshire, has to be careful not to get too bruised on the field because of her pageant dreams - despite the contact elements of the sport being her favourite part.

She already has a second place finish in the Miss Nuneaton competition under her belt and won the town's Charity Queen sash in 2011.

Try-ing to win: Selina Singleton, 16, from Rugby, is trying for a beauty queen crown

Selina divides her free time between beauty pageants and playing on the wing for the Rugby Lions Football Club

Now she's got her eye on the Miss England crown, starting with the Miss Leicestershire competition this month.

But she doesn't let the demands of the catwalk stop her from playing as a winger for a women's team at the Rugby Lions Football Club.

Selina, who is 5ft 7 tall, said: 'I started entering pageants in 2011 after I got scouted in the street.

'I love taking part, I've made so many life-long friends and I just really enjoy it.

'I love sport, but I'm also very girly so I love beauty pageants too. I'm certainly not a tomboy.

'I hope to carry on entering beauty pageants for as long as I can.'

Selina didn't tell her rugby-playing friends at first about her pageant plans.

She said: 'I didn't tell them about the competition until a couple of weeks ago as I wasn't sure how they would take it.

'But it turns out they're really supportive. Being involved in beauty pageants has given me so much confidence.

Selina, who wants to be a PE teacher or work in sports development when she finishes school, hopes the Miss England crown will be hers - starting with the Miss Leicestershire competition

Selina, on the front row, took a while to tell her Rugby Lions Football Club team mates that she was aiming at beauty titles but they were supportive

'The friends I've made from it are amazing and we always meet up outside of the competition.'

Selina
lives at home with her mum Amanda and three-year-old brother Leon, and 
wants to become a PE teacher or work in sports development once she 
finishes school.

Selina said: 'I play rugby every Sunday, which is sometimes difficult because pageants are always on Sundays.

'But last year when I played for my school team I had a pageant on the Friday and missed rugby in the morning.

'My favourite aspect is the contact side of rugby. It's such a laugh. But then pageants have helped my confidence and are really fun.

'My friends, family and boyfriend support me through it all.'

Miss England director Angie Beasley said: 'We are delighted that we attract sporty girls like Selina in to the Miss England contest although its rare to find a female rugby entrant.

'Miss England is all about being an all rounder - you have to be sporty as well as being charitable and possess good looks and be photogenic which as you can see she is.

'Selina certainly stands a good chance in the contest and I wish her the best of luck.'
