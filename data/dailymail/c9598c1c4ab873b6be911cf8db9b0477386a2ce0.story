A piece of quick thinking from James Rodriguez helped Colombia to a 1-0 win over Canada in Tuesday night's international friendly in New Jersey.

The Real Madrid superstar was fouled just outside the penalty area in the 75th minute and while the Canadian defence was arranging their wall, he urged Juan Fernando Quintero to take the set-piece quickly.

Rodriguez then powered the ball past goalkeeper Milan Borjan from about 30 yards to break the deadlock and score what proved to be the winner.

The South Americans had been frustrated by Borjan until that point and also by the linesman's flag when Manchester United's Radamel Falcao had the ball in the net during the first half.

The late winner gave Colombia their second victory in the space of five days at the Red Bull Arena after Friday's 3-0 success over El Salvador.

Rodriguez was denied by Borjan on several occasions, while the £63m man fired wide of the target with other openings.

Canada, ranked 120 in the world by FIFA, defended for long spells with 10 men behind the ball and made it difficult for Colombia, who are currently rated the third best.

Falcao, who opened his account for United in the 2-1 win over Everton before the international break, produced an accomplished finish after 17 minutes but saw it chalked off.

Borjan had to be at his best to deny a Rodriguez free-kick from 25 yards shortly before half-time, while the World Cup star shot high and wide just after the break.

Canada's best effort arrived in the 89th minute when Cyle Larin managed to dribble unchallenged to the edge of the box before goalkeeper Camilo Vargas saved.
