A West Virginia lawmaker has apologized over recent comments he made about childbirth resulting from rape.

Republican state legislator Brian Kurcaba said on Thursday that women who are raped should not be able to abort their pregnancies, and that the child that comes as a result is 'beautiful.'

This as he argued in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

'For somebody to take advantage of somebody else in such a horrible and terrifying and brutal way is absolutely disgusting,' said Kurcaba in his speech according to WOWK.

'But what is beautiful is the child that could come as a production of this.'

He quickly issued an apology however following public outrage over this belief.

'I apologize to anyone who took my comments about the sanctity of human life to mean anything other than that all children are precious regardless of circumstances,' he said in the statement.

'It is unfortunate that the only portions of my statement were publicized resulting in misrepresentation. As always, I will ensure that my focus continues to be on making West Virginia a better place to create jobs and raise a family.' 

Kurcaba, from Morgantown, West Virginia, is a financial adviser who was supported in his race by West Virginians for Life, an anti-abortion group.
