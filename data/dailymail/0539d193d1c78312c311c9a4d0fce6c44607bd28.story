Confidence in the British economy is at its highest level since the Coalition came to power amid signs the recovery is gathering pace.

A report published today by polling experts YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research think tank shows the mood among UK households is the most optimistic since April 2010.

It means confidence has returned to levels not seen since Labour was booted from office in May 2010 as the economy reeled from the aftermath of the financial crisis and the biggest boom and bust in British history.

Growing: Confidence in the British economy is at its highest level since the Coalition came to power amid signs the recovery is gathering pace

The UK remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century with economic output more than 3 per cent below the pre-recession peak reached in early 2008.

But official figures published today are expected to show the recovery strengthened this spring following growth of 0.3 per cent between January and March.

Analysts believe that gross domestic product grew by around 0.6 per cent between April and June - the fastest pace since the Olympics boosted output last summer - although it is hoped the number could be even higher.

A strong figure will come as a relief to George Osborne who believes that Britain is finally on the road to recovery.

Relief: Chancellor George Osborne yesterday welcomed figures showing Britain attracted more investment from overseas than any other European country last year, creating thousands of jobs

The Chancellor yesterday welcomed figures showing Britain attracted more investment from overseas than any other European country last year, creating thousands of jobs.

‘In today’s global race this is very encouraging,’ he said.

The report by YouGov and the CEBR puts its ‘consumer confidence index’ at 104.6 - the highest level for more than three years.

It says the resurgence in consumer confidence is down to a number of factors - including rising house prices and improving job security.

‘British households are pulling out of a nosedive and consumers’ economic optimism is moving in the right direction,’ said YouGov’s Stephen Harmston.

‘With consumer spending accounting for so much of GDP, households have a key role to play in economic growth.’

But the report warns that many households still expect their financial situation to deteriorate over the next 12 months as rising prices eat into wages and savings.

Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the CEBR, said the ‘key question’ was how long the ‘uptick’ in the economy can last.

‘There are fragilities beneath the surface,’ he said. ‘Nonetheless, we are seeing real, sustained improvement in the UK economy.

'It’s the first time we’ve been able to say that since the initial recovery from deep recession in 2009.’

A survey by the CBI yesterday showed factory output rose again this month as the manufacturing sector took a further step on the road to recovery.

Firms won new orders at the fastest pace since April 2012. Domestic orders recorded the strongest growth in a year while export orders rose at the fastest rate in more than two years.

But Annalisa Piazza, a senior economist at financial broker Newedge Strategy, said ‘exports remain a pocket of weakness for the UK economy’ as the crisis in the eurozone saps demand.

A separate report by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors showed the outlook for Britain’s struggling builders is finally improving after years of decline.

‘It is clearly good news that the amount of construction taking place across the country seems to have turned a corner,’ said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the trade body.

‘But this modest improvement comes after a long period of contraction and many businesses in the sector are still struggling to keep their heads above water.’

The construction industry was hammered in the financial crisis with output down by nearly a fifth since 2008.
