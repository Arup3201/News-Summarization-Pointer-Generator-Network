An internet campaign is underway to ‘Find Lee’, a good Samaritan who left a note on a woman's Mini with the registration number of a truck he saw scraping the car and driving away.

Natalie-Jane Davey returned to her car 
after parking it in Richmond, London on Friday afternoon to find the 
note on her windscreen.

An anonymous passerby, who gave his name only as Lee, said someone had scratched her white Mini and irresponsibly driven off, but he had taken their registration so she would be able to trace them.

Owner: Natalie-Jane Davey (left) returned to her car after parking it in Richmond, London only to find it had been scratched by another driver, who had left the scene

He left details that a scaffolding truck had scraped her car along the petrol cap.

However, police told Ms Davey that without Lee giving a formal witness statement officers would be unable to prosecute the truck driver, prompting her to post a picture of the note on Facebook in an attempt to find him.

Written in a neat black handwriting, the note reads: 'Hello, A scaffolding truck has just scraped your car right along the petrol cap.

Memo: In the note Lee said someone had scratched her white Mini and irresponsibly driven off, but he had taken their registration so she would be able to trace them

Damage: The car was also left with a scratch along the petrol cap

'They didn’t come back so I got the reg for you.

'Get the cheeky *******!

'Lee.'

Lee is believed to drive a black Audi and the van allegedly responsible for scraping Natalie’s Mini on Shaftesbury Road is thought to be a DAF Scaffolding truck.

Search: Despite the presence of the note, Ms Davey was told that without Lee giving a formal witness statement, officers would be unable to prosecute the truck driver

'It is the amazing power of the Internet,' said Ms Davey.

She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has helped with the campaign!

'I really can’t get over the response this has got. I feel like I’ve had 30,000 hugs for me and my little Mini.'
