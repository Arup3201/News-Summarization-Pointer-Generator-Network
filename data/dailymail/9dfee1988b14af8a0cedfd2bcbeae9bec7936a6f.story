This mysterious 'Arabic' scrawl found on several Southwest Airlines planes triggered security fears earlier this week and an investigation by the FBI.

But aviation and language experts today claim they were the work of a lone graffiti artist - and are not actually Arabic at all.

The special chemical paint appears towards the back of the 737 aircraft, but only after an auxiliary power unit on the plane is turned on - warming the underbelly, engines and landing gear.

Spooky: The special chemical paint appears on several 737 aircraft, but only after an auxiliary power unit on the plane is turned on, warming the underbelly

The airline had suggested the symbols, 
which only show up with heat and are believed to be vandalism, looked 
like Arabic writing.

However the Department of Arabic and Islamic 
Studies at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. looked at the photos
 for MailOnline and a spokesman concluded they are ‘not Arabic script’.

Most of the affected planes appear to 
be flying out of Los Angeles, California. Southwest Airlines said the 
markings are not seen as a threat, but began appearing on the bellies of
 its jets earlier this year.

In a statement to KNX 1070 radio, 
Southwest said it is working with authorities to uncover who was behind 
the 'vandalism', but added that currently it is not clear how many 
people are involved.

‘The markings have no affiliation to 
any known group or activity,’ a Southwest spokesman said. ‘The markings 
at this time are being considered vandalism.’

The markings have been appearing on 
the airline's signature 737 jets for the past several months and vary in
 appearance, the spokesman said. They began to appear in February, 
reported Gawker.

Security fears: The markings have raised alarm about someone's ability to get that close to an aircraft

The FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies concluded the markings do not present a threat or a safety hazard and are vandalism - not terrorist-related, the 
spokesman added.

Officials did not say whether the 
markings are messages of any sort, or if they are words or simply 
scribbling. They do not know if they were made on purpose or were caused
 by a mechanical issue.

David Learmount, operations and 
security editor of aerospace publisher Flight Global, told MailOnline he believes it was ‘an inside job’.

‘If it has been going on since 
February and there have been no ill effects it doesn’t seem very 
dangerous, because if it’s an insider with access to aircraft, why has 
he not done harm in the intervening seven months if that were his 
intent? He’s only made a few harmless daubs.’

He added graffiti artists are 
often motivated by spraying in places where they should not be 
allowed - and remain undetected.

‘Railways and railway property have 
been popular worldwide - maybe they’re now targeting airlines and 
airport property,’ he said.

Southwest Airlines, which exclusively 
uses 737 aircraft in its routes, had determined that there was no danger
 to the planes or the passengers, the spokesman said.

‘We obviously take the behavior very 
seriously and we will continue to involve local and federal law 
enforcement as needed until the situation is resolved,’ the spokesman 
added.

Several theories have been put forward as to the origin of the writing, including vandalism by an employee.

Charles Feldman broke the story after being tipped off by a source.

He said: 'It does raise disturbing 
questions about the security because anybody who has the ability to 
write on an airplane and can get that close to do it, also has the 
ability to do other things to that aircraft.'

Arizona-based television channel ABC15
 had cited multiple sources as saying that the markings appear to be 
Arabic words. But these pictures have since appeared on Gawker.

The photos were sent to Gawker by a 
Southwest employee, who said the markings are usually seen on the 
exhaust pipe of engines and look like swords. He said he had not seen 
any 'Arabic' writing.

Security across the U.S. has been 
tightened in recent weeks due to the 10th anniversary of the September 
11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington D.C.
