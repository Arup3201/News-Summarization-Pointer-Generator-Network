A quick message from Lewis Hamilton before he flew back to Los Angeles: I love Britain and Britain loves me.

It was late on Sunday night and the Formula One world champion was clearly in a state of shock after beating Rory McIlroy to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

The bookmakers, and most pundits, had not given him a prayer and he had believed them.

Before being driven away in a silver Mercedes from the ceremony in Glasgow’s Hydro en route to his private jet and a skiing holiday in the States, he said: ‘I’ve obviously seen stories. I’m aware of ups and downs of negativity and positivity within the Press and I’m sure it’s not easy for people watching on TV to understand who someone is.

‘It’s not until I meet people that things change.’

Hamilton, who lives in tax exile in Monaco, added: ‘I didn’t know how popular I was here. People realise I do raise the flag proudly.

‘I don’t know how many people called in, but I’m just overwhelmed.’

Within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in Glasgow, the racing driver was being attacked on social media sites such as Twitter for his status as a tax exile

Hamilton won 209,920 votes to McIlroy’s 123,745. Jo Pavey, the European 10,000 metres champion, got 99,913. The total cast was 620,932. What do the figures tell us? That the enthusiasm for neither candidate went off the dial. Last year Andy Murray won with 401,470 votes, despite fewer people watching the programme than this year (5.6m on average compared with 6m).

McIlroy’s support on Sunday would have put him fifth in 2012, though that was Olympic year and competition was fierce.

So why was his vote so low? Several possibilities: golf’s audience is older and less engaged than Formula One’s; Middle England did not like him choosing to play for Ireland in the Rio Olympics; the apparently ungallant manner of his break-up from tennis star Caroline Wozniacki; and, whisper the heresy, the possibility that Formula One is more popular than golf (this was the sixth time a Formula One driver has won Sports Personality against twice by a golfer)?

McIlroy was disappointed afterwards, but spoke graciously. Asked about his Irish affiliation, he said: ‘I don’t think it’s a question of how British I feel. It’s a question of how people view me. Look, it’s a public vote and just because I declared for one country and not another doesn’t make a difference.’

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet by his pet bulldog Roscoe

Roscoe certainly looked red carpet-ready, donning a large gold chain for the occasion
