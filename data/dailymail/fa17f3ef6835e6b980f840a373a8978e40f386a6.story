DJ Liz Kershaw is to meet the BBC Director General this week to describe how she was regularly groped by a fellow presenter while broadcasting live on Radio 1.

She said she was looking forward to telling George Entwistle ‘everything that I know’ after revealing how the male colleague had repeatedly ‘fondled her breasts’ on air in the late 1980s.

She declined to identify the groper, described as a former household name, but said she would also name other male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops fans.

Rumours about Jimmy Savile's behavious were an 'open secret', according to Liz Kershaw

Miss Kershaw, 54, who now presents a  programme on BBC Six Music, said she was ‘intimidated’ by the atmosphere at Radio 1 when she joined 25 years ago.

She said: ‘I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on, my back to the studio door, live on air. I couldn’t hear a thing except what was playing in my headphones. Then I’d find these wandering hands up my jumper, fondling my breasts.

‘And I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even exclaim because I was broadcasting to the nation. And when I complained to somebody, they were incredulous, and said “What? Don’t you like it? Are you a lesbian?”

‘The culture at Radio 1 then was something I had never encountered before. I’ve always said it was like walking into a rugby club locker room.’

Her meeting with Mr Entwistle is due to take place on Wednesday, after she revealed her experiences during a Radio 4 interview at the weekend.

She said rumours about Jimmy Savile’s behaviour were an ‘open secret’ when she joined Radio 1, mainly about his adventures on the Radio 1 roadshow.

She said: ‘It was massive then. It was rather like the X Factor going around the country. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’ Miss Kershaw joined Radio 1 shortly after Savile’s departure, but said colleagues constantly joked about his behaviour.

She said: ‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like?”

DJ Dave Lee Travis, nicknamed The Hairy Monster, is another star from the 1980s facing accusations.

In an article written after interviewing Travis in June, Sunday Times reporter Camilla Long, described how ‘over 90 minutes I don’t think there was a part of my body he did not grope’.

She added: ‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me. He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We would encourage anyone with information on such issues to speak to the police.’
