David Ospina is poised to become Arsenal's next signing.

The Nice goalkeeper has excelled for Colombia but was on Arsene Wenger's wishlist prior to the World Cup.

Wenger has considered a number of options including Norwich's John Ruddy but 25-year-old Ospina represents better value at £4million.

Meanwhile, Arsenal's Wellington Silva, 21, is joining Almeria on loan.
