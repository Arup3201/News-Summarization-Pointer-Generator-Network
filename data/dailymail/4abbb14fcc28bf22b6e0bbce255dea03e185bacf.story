'Destructive force': Culture Secretary Maria Miller has slammed Labour for involving Hacked Off in political negotiations on Press regulation

Maria Miller has slammed Labour for involving the lobby group Hacked Off in political negotiations on Press regulation, saying its presence had been a destructive force creating lasting damage.

Hacked Off, which campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press, was involved in late-night talks with representatives of the three main political parties in Labour leader Ed Miliband’s Commons office in March.

The meeting resulted in the Government unveiling its Royal Charter to underpin a new Press regulator.

The presence of Hacked Off and the exclusion of newspaper representatives led to universal rejection of the charter by publishers.

Mrs Miller, the Culture Secretary, was also forced to concede that protections against political interference in the regulation of the Press could be swept away after the next election.

She said a future government could  vote to override a clause demanding that a two-thirds parliamentary majority be reached before any changes are made to a Royal Charter.

Mrs Miller told MPs the presence of Hacked Off at the talks this year had been a ‘hijacking of government business’.

‘I assume the Labour Party invited them to that meeting... It proved to be deeply unhelpful. We had been working very closely with [deputy Labour leader] Harriet Harman prior to that point.

‘We had extensive and exhaustive meetings over some months. I had thought we got to a position... where I felt we had an effective system where we could take the Press and public with us.’

She told MPs on the Culture Select Committee that the campaigners’ presence ‘became quite a destructive force in the perception of the Press’.

She said: ‘I think it made some lasting damage. We had managed to get to a stage where we were on the verge of agreement. Some of the interventions over that weekend created a great deal of bad will.’

Mrs Miller added that the presence of Hacked Off ‘wasn’t something the Prime Minister or I was willing to accept. It was a very difficult situation.

‘We were facing the very real probability of statutory Press regulation. It wasn’t something we felt was the right answer. It was absolutely philosophically the wrong thing to do.’

The Culture Secretary also addressed claims by MPs that the so-called two-thirds safeguard against political interference was a ‘parliamentary nonsense’ that senior Commons officials believe could be replaced or changed after the 2015 general election.

Conservative Conor Burns told the committee: ‘The advice that I have had when I have gone to talk to very senior clerks is that the two-thirds is a parliamentary nonsense; that no parliament can bind a successor parliament, and that if a successor parliament wanted to amend or change or bring in a different charter, they could do that by a simple majority.’

Mrs Miller replied: ‘The principle behind that provision was to very much ensure that the charter could not be changed simply on the whim of ministers who are Privy Counsellors at the time.

‘Of course a government can pass laws, and with a simple majority in the House of Commons can change anything it wants to change, but what I think we are doing in putting that provision in place is giving Parliament a very clear ability to be able to press any government on why it might not adhere to that, and I think that is a really rather important thing to have been done.’

Last month, Mrs Miller indicated that the Royal Charter could become redundant if the industry’s new watchdog, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, proved to be successful.

Asked if she had meant to make such a suggestion, Mrs Miller told MPs it was not possible to mandate Press involvement in a Royal Charter process, ‘otherwise you will be having statutory regulation’.

She added: ‘I’m very pleased indeed with the progress the Press has been making in setting up Ipso and the support that is being garnered within the industry for the approach that is being taken.’
