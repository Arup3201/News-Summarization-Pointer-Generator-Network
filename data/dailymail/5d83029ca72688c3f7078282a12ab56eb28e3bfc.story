'Baby-faced killer': Marissa Williams, 19, has been charged with solicitation of murder for allegedly trying to hire her own aunt posing on Facebook as a boy to kill her family

A 19-year-old Alabama woman has been arrested for allegedly trying to hire her own aunt posing online as a man to kill her family and even their dog.

Marissa Williams was charged Monday with solicitation of murder. She was being held in the Tuscaloosa County jail on $30,000 bond.

Williams' aunt told authorities she created a Facebook profile for a fictional man, Tre 'Topdog' Ellis, to connect with her niece and chat with her after their relationship became strained.

Williams moved in with her aunt and her family in April, but the two women were not on good terms.

The aunt became angry with Ms Williams for constantly talking to strangers online and inviting them over to her home, where the woman lived with her fiance and son.

In retaliation, the niece blocked her aunt on Facebook.

In order to keep tabs on her niece's online activities, and also to teach her a lesson about the pitfalls of talking to strangers, the aunt came up with the character of 'Topdog' Ellis.

Court records obtained by Al.com state that Ms Williams began chatting with the fictional man and confided in him that she was angry with her relatives. 

The 19-year-old also invited the bogus Facebook friend to her home to get drunk and offered to have sex with him if he agreed to pay her $50 cell phone bill.

In late May, the unaware teenager asked Ellis to come and take her away, and to shoot her aunt if she tried to stop him.

As the two continued exchanging messages online, Williams' alleged murder-for-hire plot became ever more elaborate and brutal.

Documents indicate that the teenager instructed her aunt pretending to be a young man to enter the woman's bedroom and kill her and her fiance.

Ms Williams also allegedly asked 'Topdog' to gun down her cousin and the family dog while she was busy loading her belongings into the getaway car. 

Williams' concerned aunt eventually contacted authorities for help.

When deputies responded to the family’s home in Tuscaloosa and interviewed Williams, the teen confessed and apologized, but insisted that she did not really intend to have anyone killed.
