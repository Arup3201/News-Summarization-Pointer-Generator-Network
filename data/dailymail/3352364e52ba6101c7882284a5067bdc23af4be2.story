Buying two houses and knocking them through has long been a simple way to acquire a bigger home.

But one tycoon is taking the concept a little further after purchasing seven houses in a row facing Regent’s Park in London.

Marcus Cooper plans to knock down a few walls in the Grade I listed Regency houses to combine them into a single stuccoed ‘super-mansion’.

The resulting home will be more akin to a palace, and indeed will claim the title of London's largest residence after Buckingham Palace.

With an estimated £200million asking price, it will be one of the most expensive properties in Britain.

It will have 35 bathrooms alone, making it most unlikely there will ever be arguments about vain teenagers hogging the bathroom.

The seven-storey pad will have 15 bedrooms including a sumptuous master suite complete with an enormous dressing room and spacious 'his and hers' bathrooms.

In a row: The seven Regency houses - including Numbers 1 and 2 Chester Gate (pictured) and Numbers 6 to 10 Cambridge Terrace - are Grade I listed and were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace

On the top floor of the house is the pièce de résistance - a lush private roof garden, completely invisible from street level.

It will feature a giant sliding glass roof to allow sunbathing in hot weather, and keep out the rain during the rest of the year.

The 'hanging gardens of Camden' will be 40ft long, bigger than most ground-level gardens in the capital.

Then there is 472-acre Regent's Park itself, literally a stone's throw away.

As if all this were not enough, the property is also going to be extended - underground.

With land in Central London like gold 
dust, the subterranean extension will create a leisure complex with a 
swimming pool, jacuzzi, pool bar and cinema.

The property will have 50,000 sq ft of living space. And, in the manner of a grand stately home, it will boast a grand spiral staircase, a banqueting room, a billiards room, a library, children's rooms and a smoking room.

Developer: Marcus Cooper, 46, has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes

In recent years, they have been used as cramped office space, and the local authority has granted planning permission to restore them to residential use.

Camden Council rejected objections from local conservationists who wanted the houses to be several individual homes rather than a single dwelling, but English Heritage has backed the project.

Property mogul Marcus Cooper paid £23.7million in 2007 to buy the seven houses from the Crown Estate.

Developer Mr Cooper, 46, has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes. In April, he sold three terraces nearby for £120million to the Qatari royal family.

This latest project is the biggest so far, and will take nearly three years to complete.

Experts expect the vast home to be purchased by an oligarch from Russia or a Middle Eastern royal family.

If it is sold for £200million, that is 1,229 times more expensive than the UK average house price of £162,606.

At that asking price, the buyer will face a £14million bill for stamp duty.

Despite the shaky economic recovery, 2012 was a record year for sales in London worth more than £5million, according to research by estate agent Savills.

Another Nash property, 18 Carlton House Terrace, was recently put on the market for £250million, making it the UK's most expensive home if it reaches its asking price.
