Steve Ballmer is said to have risked it all on a new operating system for Microsoft, a gamble that may have cost the company's CEO dearly.

In the face Apple and Samsung's success in the mobile and tablet computer market, Microsoft bet the farm when it introduced Windows 8, the operating system that Ballmer had heralded as the future.

Debuting last year, Windows 8 was the nervous system of its new line of Surface tablet and smartphones.

Betting it all: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer made a big gamble when he introduced Windows 8 in October

It was no secret that Ballmer was making a huge bet. When he introduced the operating system in October, a screen behind him read: 'Windows: All in.'

But the gamble does not appear to have 
paid off, as Microsoft 8 received less-than-stellar reviews and failed 
to measure up to the hype and sales of Apple and Google devices.

Critics, as well as some consumers, lambasted the technology giant over Windows 8, mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of Microsoft's trademark 'Start' button.

Some have now called for Ballmer to quit or be fired.

Joachim Kempin, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw the building of the Windows brand, told the BBC last month that he believes Ballmer 'doesn't have the vision' to be CEO.

Any decision to oust Ballmer would have to come from his predecessor Bill Gates, who holds the largest stake in the company and personally selected Ballmer - his friend - to take over.

While Microsoft has experienced growth in recent years, any success is eclipsed by Apple, which unveiled the iPad Mini at about the same time as Windows 8.

Some reviewers liked the way Windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of 
relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years.

But others say it's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed
to the older versions, particularly when they switch to desktop mode 
and don't see the familiar 'start' button and menu.

Struck by the flurry of complaints, Microsoft is giving Windows 8 a makeover, known as Windows Blue.

Overshadowed: Microsoft's success has been eclipsed by Apple's tablets and smart phones, as well as other devices powered by Google

Tami Reller, who serves as the marketing and financial chief for Microsoft's Windows business, announced a retreat, admitting that the software had defeated many users.

She said; 'The learning curve is definitely real and we need to address it.'

The company, which is based in 
Redmond, Washington, says more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses have 
been sold so far, up from about 60 million licenses in January.

The licensing volume 'is in the same 
general ballpark,' as Microsoft's previous operating system - Windows 7 -
at a similar juncture of its sales cycle, according to Ms Reller.

In an interview, Ms Reller said 
Microsoft still realized changes need to be made to make Windows 8 
easier to navigate and capable of taking full advantage of technology 
improvements that have come out since October.

Ms Reller said: 'Are there things 
that we can do to improve the experience? Absolutely. There is a 
learning curve [to Windows 8] and we can work to address that.'

Blue also might make it easier to find
a set of controls - known as 'charms' in Windows 8's parlance - that 
currently must be pulled out from the right side of a display screen.

Besides responding to customer 
feedback, Blue also will make Windows 8 better suited for smaller, less 
expensive tablets with 7- and 8-inch display screens, Ms Reller said.

The tune-up announced on Tuesday won't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year.

One leading research firm, International Data Corp., says Windows 8 contributed to a 14 per cent decline in worldwide PC sales during the first three months of the year - the biggest year-over-year drop ever.

Meanwhile, sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming.

The biggest beneficiaries have been Apple Inc., the maker of the iPhone and iPad, and Samsung Electronics Co., which sells the most devices running on Google Inc.'s Android software.

Google is also benefiting from Android's popularity through increased traffic to its services, creating more opportunities for the company to display ads.

By contrast, leading PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., which primarily sell Windows-powered machines, have been mired in a financial funk that has battered their stocks and raised questions about their futures.

For now, Microsoft isn't saying what kind of changes will be introduced with the release of Blue, which the company plans to anoint with a different name when the update is available.

Microsoft also isn't saying whether it will charge existing owners of Windows 8 devices to get the fixes in Blue. The company plans to release Blue in time for the holiday season.

Ms Reller said more details about Blue will be released before Microsoft holds a developers conference in San Francisco in late June.

Some of Blue's features are expected to be previewed at that conference.

'I view this as a relaunch of Windows 8, finally giving everyone a fully baked version,' said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead. 'It has been a very rough road for Microsoft so far.'

If Blue is meant to make people more comfortable, the changes may incorporate more of the elements from earlier versions of Windows.

But one thing that Blue won't fix: the relatively small selection of mobile applications tailored for Windows 8. Ms Reller said the Windows 8 store now has more than 60,000 apps.

By contrast, there are more than 800,000 apps available for Apple's mobile's devices and nearly that many for Android devices, too.

In one of the most glaring omissions on Windows 8, Facebook Inc. still hasn't designed an app to make its online social network more accessible on that system.

Facebook has about 750 million mobile users.

Microsoft's decision to tweak Windows 8 so soon after its much-ballyhooed release may reinforce perceptions that the product is the company's biggest flop since the Zune - the company's answer to the iPod.

Investors still believe Windows 8 will 
pay off for Microsoft, which gets more than half of its revenue from the
sale of Windows operating systems and various software programs and 
services.

The company's stock slipped 40 cents to $33.35 in Tuesday's afternoon trading, leaving the shares with a 20 per cent gain since Windows 8 went on sale.

That outstrips the 15 per cent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the same stretch.
