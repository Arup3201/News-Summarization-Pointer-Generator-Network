The manager of a doggy day care whose four puppies were found emaciated, sick, and covered in faeces has been jailed for 60 days but allowed to keep his dogs.

The San Francisco claimed 'dog lover' Abraham Taylor, 36, was convicted of four misdemeanour counts of animal cruelty after his day care and dog-walking business unearthed four one-year-old skeletal puppies with scabbed skin and scars.

'They were malnourished and left in their own faeces,' District Attorney George Gascón told the San Francisco Examiner adding that the dogs 'couldn't even walk on their own.'

Rescued: This one-year-old dog whose ribs, hips and spine are seen protruding from its body was one of four removed from a San Francisco dog daycare center in March

Owner: The daycare's manager Abraham Taylor, 36, was convicted of four misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty and sentenced to 60 days in jail

It was in March Taylor's establishment, Unleashed SF Doggy Daycare in Bayview-Hunters Point was visited by animal care and control officers after an anonymous complaint reporting the dogs' condition.

Inside the four black Labrador-Weimaraner mixes were described terrified of human contact with their ribs and hipbones protruding.

Taylor's attorney Jo Golub said that he had given the dogs an appropriate amount of food but that they had worms.

She said medicine had been administered to the animals just before authorities visited the day care.

Gascón called the crime 'disgusting' saying that the dogs doubled their weight within a month of their rescue.

Recovering: Within a month the dogs, two pictured, were said to have gained half of their weight while two of the four have since been adopted

On Thursday Taylor, who is still a manager but signed his business over to his girlfriend Allison – who renamed it Allison’s Unleashed at the same location - received his sentence which includes a $880 fine and three years’ probation.

During that time he cannot adopt, care for, feed or board animals with the exception of the three dogs he personally owns.

Those dogs, they city said, were found in good health.

He has additionally been forbidden from adopting any additional dogs.

Golub said her client plans to appeal his conviction, calling Taylor a lifelong dog lover.

Other dog lovers in the area, however, voiced their upset with his punishment with one calling it a ‘slap on the wrist.’

'Places like this should be shut down. This guy just got a slap on the wrist,' a Yelp user, one of several who took to its page to downgrade the business and share their own stories, wrote on Friday.

‘I reported prior abuse on Yelp,’ another user wrote. ‘Allison and /or Abe managed to have my report deleted so the public was not warned or informed. By deleting these messages, more dogs were hurt and abused.’

The four dogs have since all recovered from their illnesses with two named Katie and Harry since adopted.

Two others, Annette and Rosalynn, were sent for further rehabilitation but have since recovered and are looking for a good home.
