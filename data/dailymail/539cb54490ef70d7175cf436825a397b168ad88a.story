What do you get when you cross bacon, a cheeseburger, and a donut?

You get PYT Burger's 'The D'oh! Nut.'

Paying homage to beloved cartoon character Homer Simpson, the Philadelphia-based restaurant PYT Burger praised the character's love of donuts by adding other loves to the mix -- a cheeseburger and bacon.

PYT Burger: The burger joint is famous for creating what it refers to as 'America's Craaaziest Burgers'

The restaurant, famous for creating what it refers to as 'America's Craaaziest Burgers,' has done it again by taking a donut, stuffing it with American cheese and beef, and covering it in bacon.

This food-coma-inducing and blood-pressure-raising creation can be yours for $13, according to PYTBurger. It's an extravagant price for an extravagant burger. 

The D'oh Nut! has joined a long list of 'craaazy' burger creations by the burger joint which also sells what it calls 'Adult Shakes' -- that's milkshakes with alcohol mixed in.

Other over-the-top burgers once served by the restaurant as part of its 'Burger of the Week Club' include:
