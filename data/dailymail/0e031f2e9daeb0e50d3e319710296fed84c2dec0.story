Airport arrest: Michael Hamlyn has been charged with possession of cocaine and amphetemines

Millionaire film and theatre producer Michael Hamlyn has been charged with possessing cocaine and amphetamines.

Hamlyn, who made the Oscar-winning The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, was held by police at Stansted Airport.

Officers are believed to have arrested him after allegedly finding the class A drugs on his return from a board meeting with a youth arts charity in Northern Ireland.

If convicted, Hamlyn, 58, faces a 
jail sentence of up to seven years. He is due to appear at Chelmsford 
Magistrates’ Court on December 30. 

Friends
 say he is worried about a possible drugs conviction barring him from 
entering the US where he once had an office and often attends celebrity 
parties in Los Angeles.

Hamlyn is registered as living on his own at a £3.8million four-storey Georgian terraced house in North London.

He
 was originally due to appear in court next Monday but it is believed he
 had the court appearance put back so he could travel to visit family in
 Australia.

During the 1980s Hamlyn’s film company made critically-acclaimed music videos for the Rolling Stones, U2 and Bruce Springsteen.

He
 brought his 1994 hit film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to the stage 
in a musical in 2006. It has since played in the West End and on 
Broadway, winning many awards.

Hamlyn’s position in the art world was so prominent that he was once a governor of London’s Southbank Centre.

The
 drugs charge is likely to be highly embarrassing to Hamlyn’s family and
 friends, who include Sir Terence Conran. He part-owns the Bibendum 
restaurant in Chelsea with the British designer.

Hamlyn has two children, Lili, 20, and Reuben, 18, with his former wife Sara. The couple divorced in 2000.

His father was the publishing baron and controversial Labour donor Lord Hamlyn who  left £530million when he died  in 2001.

Lord Hamlyn donated a record £2.5million while Tony Blair led the party and was made a life peer in 1999.

During the 1980s, he had a run-in with Margaret Thatcher over his publication of Spycatcher, the memoirs of MI5 agent Peter Wright, which was banned in England.

Hamlyn is a trustee of his father’s charity, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, which has given millions of pounds to artists and good causes.

Essex Police confirmed Hamlyn had been arrested on December 5 and was charged with possessing class A and B drugs.

Both Hamlyn and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation declined to comment.
