Jason Manford, 33, was blasted by fans as being 'insensitive' after making the comment on Facebook

Comedian Jason Manford has come under fire for joking that ‘Jews should have been given a bit of Germany’ after the Second World War.

The 33-year-old, who has been embroiled in a number of controversies over recent years, caused outrage after posting the comment on his Facebook page.

Many commenters blasted him for being ‘insensitive’ after he made the reference in a comment about the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.

He wrote: ‘I’m trying to read up on the Middle East situation but one question keeps popping up and I can’t find the answer.

‘When Britain & the UN were deciding on where to put the Jews, why didn’t they just give them a huge f****** bit of Germany instead of a country already occupied.’

Several people were quick to comment on the post, with one user, Gemma Berger, writing: ‘Did you really have to start this thread? This isn’t a laughing matter.’

In total the post attracted 1,493 comments and 518 shares before Manford added: ‘Wow actually getting serious informative replies from both sides, on a contentious delicate subject. Ah Facebook, you never cease to amaze me!’

It is thought he later deleted the post but took to his profile again to thank people for their response, suggesting he was ‘a little more informed than before’.

The post came as the death toll in Gaza rose to 1,175, all of whom have died since the fighting began on July 8.

Despite the criticism, one user appeared to welcome the debate and called for it to become a weekly event.

Christine Dennison wrote on Manford’s Facebook page: ‘Bit off subject, but really interesting reading this morning regarding the conflict between Israel and Gaza.

‘Any chance of one serious topic a week? But please keep the funnies coming, loving seeing how wound up people can get!’

Manford has been at the centre of a few controversies over recent years.

He was infamously sacked as presenter of BBC’s The One Show after it emerged he had internet sex sessions with a porn star and 12 fans.

And last year he was in the spotlight again after allegedly exchanging 'hundreds of messages' with a woman while he was still married to his actress wife Catherine. The pair later confirmed they would be separating after six years of marriage.
