Jailed: Pawnbroker Harvey White, pictured, used his business to cover up the proceeds of the scam

A pawnbroker helped launder £1million for a gang of rogue builders who conned elderly and vulnerable victims out of their life savings. 

Harvey White, 49, used his business in Clacton, Essex, to cover up the proceeds of the scam, which saw the gang of six builders overcharging their customers for work to their homes.

Most of the cheques used to pay for the building work - which was often left incomplete - were paid out at White's pawnshop, where he had a licence to cash cheques.

Roughly £9million passed through the business over a five-year period, but police could only trace £1million back to the gang of builders, who operated in north Essex, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

But, as more than half of the suspected 140 victims contacted were unwilling to help and others died before enough evidence was collected, police believe that the actual amount of money laundered was much higher.

White, from Clacton, was jailed for nine years after being convicted of laundering money and six gang members were sentenced in July for their roles in the scam. 

Judge John Dodd QC said: 'Some £9million passed through your accounts between 2008 and 2013, but it has not been possible to find the provenance of all that money,

'What we do know is you did have a completely dishonest side to your business where the principle money laundering for this gang of rogue builders took place. You were an absolutely vital part of this.'  

Two of the gang members were caught on tape celebrating the death of one of their victims, who had been duped out of £123,000, because she wouldn't be able to testify against them.  

And widower Andrew Millar, who is blind, believes the gang stole at least £300,000 from him.

The 68-year-old had known the gang's ringleader, James Brown Snr, for 25 years because the builder had carried out work for his late wife, Marjorie. 

While 92-year-old Helen Reeve-Smith, from Clacton, paid more than £10,000 in cheques for work that was left incomplete. 

Detectives found CCTV of Brown Snr taking Mrs Smith to a bank to withdraw money in a clearly in a confused state. She died in June last year.

Ringleader James Brown Senior, 45, of Colchester, was jailed for 10 years for his part in the scam. 

His son, James Brown Jnr, brother, William Brown, and accomplices, Peter Biddle and Van Purdy, were jailed in July for their involvement. Anthony Symes was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence.

Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said White was trusted by the gang.

He said: 'These sort of men were not using an innocent dupe. They did not go to someone they did not know or trust.

'Harvey White is a professional criminal, a professional villain. They used a professional.'

White did not give evidence in his trial.

When he was interviewed, he told police he did not know the cheques were the proceeds of crime.      

Two of the builders involved in the scam were recorded celebrating the death of one of their elderly victims.

Ringleader James Brown Snr and his accomplice William Brown had tricked 87-year-old Grace Gibbs into spending £123,000 on unnecessary building work. 

And they celebrated the fact that she couldn't give evidence against them after discovering that she had died on Christmas Eve in 2012. 

In a recording, William Brown said: 'She’s gone, Jim, it’s good news init.'

James Brown Snr replied: 'It is, isn’t it.'

The men then discussed that it was 'cancer that killed her' before they agreed that it was the reason why the police hadn't contacted them again. 

Mrs Gibbs was one of a suspected 140 victims who were conned by the gang, who targetted victims in north Essex.
