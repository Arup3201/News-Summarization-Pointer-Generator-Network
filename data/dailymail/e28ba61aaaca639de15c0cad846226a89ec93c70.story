A representative of the Jordanian government, counsellor Rulan Samara from the London embassy, told the court: 'His majesty the King of Jordan (King Abdullah the Second) was inquiring about the matter and was asking about all the details.'

Three members of the Jordanian Paralympic squad charged with sex offences will not be taking part in the Games, organisers have confirmed.

The three men – two wheelchair power lifters, including a bronze medallist from the Beijing Games, and a trainer – are accused of sexual assault and voyeurism against women and girls during a training camp in Northern Ireland.

Earlier this week a court granted the men bail with sureties of £5,500 each, enabling them to travel to London to compete.

But Locog said today that the Jordanian Paralympic Committee had withdrawn the men from their team for London 2012.

Omar Sami Qaradhi, 31, Faisal Hammash, 35, and Motaz Al Junaidi, 45, all members of the Jordanian power-lifting squad, are now returning to Jordan after the country’s king began looking into the case.

‘We have been informed by the Jordanian National Paralympic Committee that they will not be entering the athletes in question into the London 2012 Paralympic Games,’ said a Locog spokewoman.

‘The athletes have returned to Jordan.’

The three team members are flying to the Jordanian capital, Amman, today.

The men are due back in court in Northern Ireland on October 18.

Motaz Al Junaidi, 45, who won bronze at the Paralympics in Beijing, is accused of sexual assault.

Team-mate Omar Sami Qaradhi, 31, faces three charges of sexual assault, two against a child, and one of voyeurism after allegedly entering a women’s changing room at the Antrim Forum leisure centre where the squad was training.

Police said he was identified by a girl aged 14, who claimed that on August 18 she posed for photos with him before he groped her between the legs in Antrim town centre.

Trainer Faisal Hammash, 35, is accused of inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity. Mr Cahir said he was merely photographing the girls in the Antrim area.

Applying for bail, Tony Cahir, solicitor for the three accused, said Al Junaidi was born with polio.

Mr Cahir said Qaradhi had not had any legs since birth and was incapable of sexual gratification.

The three were released on combined 
bail and sureties of £5,500 each after appearing at Coleraine 
Magistrates’ Court in Co Londonderry.

They have to make weekly contact with the Jordanian embassy in London before their next appearance in court.

In granting bail, district judge 
Richard Wilson said he accepted the argument that the embarrassment 
should they fail to reappear in court would outweigh the resulting 
financial loss.

He added: ‘I trust the assurances that have been given to me by the ambassador are such that that would not be required.’

The Jordanian team has been training 
in Antrim, about 22 miles from Belfast, in advance of the Paralympic 
Games starting next week.

Arriving for hearing: Omar (left) was allegedly identified by a girl aged 14 who claimed that on August 18 she posed for photos with him before he groped her between the legs, while one of the alleged victims made claims against Motaz (right) after police had begun their investigation and several days after the disputed incident

The three were detained on Monday for questioning by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

The court heard earlier this week that the king of Jordan is taking a personal interest in the case.

A representative of the Jordanian 
government, counsellor Rulan Samara from the London embassy, told the 
court: ‘His majesty the king of Jordan (King Abdullah the Second) was 
inquiring about the matter and was asking about all the details.’

Supporting a bail application, she 
promised that the accused would be brought back for future court 
appearances in Northern Ireland by her government and offered a surety.

The Jordanian delegation arrived in 
Northern Ireland on August 8. The alleged offences took place between 
last Thursday and Monday.

The Jordan Paralympic Committee said it felt ‘regret and shock’ at the charges but that they had confidence the defendants would get a 
fair hearing.

But following the accusations, the Jordanian Paralympic Committee said it would not have been appropriate for them to have taken part in London 2012.

'The president and board of the Jordanian Paralympic Committee (JPC) decided that, although the case will not be heard again in court until October 18, it would be inappropriate for the accused athletes to compete at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, so they will be sent home to Amman,' said a committee statement.

It added: 'We have a zero tolerance on any misconduct and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland authorities to assist in their investigation.

'However, our focus is now preparing the remaining members of the team for competition and we look forward to taking part in what promises to be a truly magnificent sporting event.'
