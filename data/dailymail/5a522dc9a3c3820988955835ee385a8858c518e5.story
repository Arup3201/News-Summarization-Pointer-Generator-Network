The level of hate towards Wayne Rooney in this country rocketed to record highs this weekend, with bizarre calls for him to be stripped of the Manchester United captaincy following his red card against West Ham.

These people making such suggestions must be small children or they have short memories.

I can’t remember them demanding Roy Keane to be burned at the stake when he saw red as United captain. Keane described himself as a 'psycho' with 'veins bulging' as he berated a referee. Yet Rooney, according to the critics, is not a United captain because he shouts at team-mates who make mistakes. Can you imagine how Keane would have torn into that United defence at Leicester? Sends a shudder down the spine.

Here’s the truth: Rooney is a working class kid who’s made something of himself, he’s an achiever, he’s a success story. Some can’t handle that. It could be a class-hate thing, it could be jealousy. Maybe it’s because he plays for Manchester United.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that Wayne Rooney can break whatever record he wants for his club, he can win all sorts of medals, but the haters are still going to hate him.

I suspect Rooney couldn’t care less what these people think.

When he becomes United’s record goalscorer he can laugh in everyone’s face.

But Rooney does care about England; given the level of criticism he has received during his international career he could almost be forgiven for walking away form some of the nonsense that’s been said and written about him. But he still craves international football.

And if he cares what the haters think of him, then there is only one way he can turn them around.

And that’s to become the first England captain to lift a meaningful trophy. In France in 2016, it will be 50 years since England won the World Cup. We are all such strangers to success for England it seems unthinkable.

But for Wayne Rooney to lead England to European Championship glory would surely shut his critics up.

He’s started his England captaincy in perfect fashion. Two games, two wins, no goals conceded.

As a dedicated England fan I want the captain of our great country to know I’m on his side.
