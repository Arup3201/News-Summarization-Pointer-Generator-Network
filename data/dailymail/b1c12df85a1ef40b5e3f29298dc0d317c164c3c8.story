Alex Buttner will complete a move from Manchester United to Dinamo Moscow in the next 24 hours after the two clubs agreed a deal to take the Dutch left-back to Russia.

Sportsmail understands that United have managed to secure an initial fee in the region of £4 million for the defender signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012.

The deal could rise to £5.6 million based on add-ons and if certain clauses are met.

Buttner was deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal after Manchester United secured the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton this week.

Manchester United confirmed the switch via the club's Twitter account on Saturday afternoon.

Dinamo posted a statement on their official website on Tuesday which said Buttner's contract was 'agreed upon' and that only 'technical details' were left to negotiate. They also posted pictures of the left-back in their training kit.

The 25-year-old Dutchman, who posed with fellow new boy Stanislav Manolev, said: 'I want to play in the Champions League, win trophies.

'Dinamo are a very strong team and I am confident that we will fight for first place this season.'

Buttner then took to Instagram to thank United fans for support during his time at the club. He said: 'Thanks for everything! Had a amazing 2 years at this beautyful club Manchester united! Thanks to all my fans for supporting me!!'

Buttner made a total of only 28 appearances in all competitions, scoring two goals, having joined United from Vitesse Arnhem in the summer of 2012.
