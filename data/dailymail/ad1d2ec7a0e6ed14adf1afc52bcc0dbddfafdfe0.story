Moroccan Ahmad Masrur Cham, 32, has been jailed for five years for rape after he was identified by a blind man – who recognised his voice.

Spanish musician Adiel Girón Oquendo, 63, who plays the accordion on the street in the town of Seville, in the south Spanish province of Andalucia, had met his Brazilian woman friend and invited her for a drink when the attack happened.

He said that the young woman had probably drunk too much and that later they had been joined by another man who had offered to drive them home, and all three had gone back to his flat in a taxi.

But when they got there the Moroccan had forced the woman into a bedroom and raped her despite her begging him to leave her alone. He had then left.

Adiel said: 'There was nothing I could do, the door was locked, I tried to call neighbours but it was all too late.'

But the police arrested the man after a tip off and later he was identified by his voice after a statement from the blind man.

Cham who admitted having sex with the 23-year-old denied that it had not been consensual, but this was rejected by the blind man who said: 'I heard her telling him to leave her alone.'

The court sentenced him to five years in prison and ordered to pay €6,000 in compensation to his victim.
