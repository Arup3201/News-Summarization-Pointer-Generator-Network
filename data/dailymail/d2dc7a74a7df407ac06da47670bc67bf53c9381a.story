Tottenham sensation Harry Kane took his first steps as an international footballer at Wembley on Friday night. But how did his fare on his big night?

7.20pm - Preparing for the biggest night in his fledgling career, Kane takes to Wembley's hallowed turf for the first time as senior a England international to complete his warm-up. 

He completes the formality of his sprints and stretches whilst soaking in the growing Wembley atmosphere. He has a slightly nervous look on his face, understandably.

7.40pm - He takes his seat on the Wembley bench alongside Tottenham team-mate Andros Townsend just before the two starting line-ups emerge. 

As ever, there isn't a hair out of place as Kane makes himself comfortable, but, still, his looks far from relaxed. Wayne Rooney's early goal should have eased the tension, though.

34mins  - He climbs off the bench for the first time, together with Townsend and and James Milner, to have jog along the byline. 

He's given a generous round of applause from home fans, he responds by giving them a gentle clap back before beginning some abductor stretches. Gently easing his way into the England life.

63min — Kane gets the call from England assistant Ray Lewington. 

To add to the tension, he’s made to wait in the technical area for almost six minutes before replacing Rooney. Wembley erupts. Have they got a new hero?

73min — Can. You. Believe. It? With his third touch, less than two minutes into his debut, he plants a header home from Raheem Sterling’s cross to make it 4-0. 

He slides on his knee in celebration as Wembley go mad. Absolute fairytale stuff.

76min — Kane comes close to a second after a scramble in the box then nearly sets up Theo Walcott for a fifth. 

Those early nerves are a distant memory as Kane takes to international football like a duck to water.

94min — The final whistle goes to end a match Kane will never forget. The focus of attention for much of the week, on the biggest night of his career he delivered. 

A few team-mates swapped shirts at the end — but there was no chance of him doing the same.
