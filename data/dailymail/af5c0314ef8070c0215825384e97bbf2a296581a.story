U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is asking MTV to cancel the West Virginia-based reality show Buckwild that's set to air next year.

The program is due to begin on January 3 in the slot previously occupied by Jersey Shore.

Manchin's office said Friday that he sent a letter to the president of the network saying the show profits off the 'poor decisions of our youth.'

'Ugly': The controversial show is due to premiere on January 3

The senator also said the show plays to 'ugly, inaccurate stereotypes' about the people of his home state.

The network ordered 12 episodes of the show last fall, and a trailer shows the cast drinking and swearing, four-wheeling and fighting, even filling a dump truck with water and using it as a swimming pool.

It was shot in Sissonville and Charleston.  

The letter sent by Senator Manchin to MTV president Stephen Friedman, Manchin described the show as 'repulsive.'

'As a proud West Virginian, I am writing to formally request that you put a stop to the travesty called Buckwild,' wrote Manchin.

'Instead of showcasing the beauty of our people and our state, you preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior -- and now you are profiting from it. That is just wrong.'

MTV have yet to comment.

But Buckwild producer John Stevens told Entertainment Weekly that the show 'celebrates the youths in a very positive way.'

'It's not like looking at a train wreck,' Stevens said.

'That's not what it is. That's the part I'm really excited about. There is a certain coolness to it. It's different than a lot of the stuff that has been produced.

'I think it's going to get people talking and it might change people's perspectives. These kids are totally wild and carefree. It will be very refreshing to the MTV audience.'
