Delta airlines was hit with an outpouring of ridicule yesterday after it celebrated the U.S. World Cup victory over Ghana with a photo of a giraffe - despite there being no giraffes in Ghana.

The airline published a picture captioned 'congrats team #USA!', accompanied by a picture spelling out the 2-1 victory.

To represent the two U.S. goals - scored by Clint Dempsey and John Brooks - the airline used an image of the Statue of Liberty. And to depict Ghana it used a picture of a giraffe, which Twitter users were quick to point out do not live in the country at all.

Blunder: The airline attempted to celebrate the U.S. World Cup win over Ghana by tweeting this image - which was attacked for being 'ignorant'

About turn: After being informed that there are no giraffes in Ghana, the airline deleted its tweet and apologised

Fact check: Some helpful tweeters suggested more appropriate choices to depict Ghana

'Ignorant' Delta was relentlessly mocked for the blunder, with one tweeter pointing out that 'checking Wikipedia for three seconds' would have made clear that giraffes are not native to Ghana.

The offending tweet was swiftly deleted from Delta's account, and followed by an apology. The company - which runs flights to Ghana - said: 'We're sorry for our choice of photo in our previous tweet. Best of luck to all teams.'

The social media blunder followed a rare victory over Ghana for the U.S. - which has twice been knocked out of the World Cup by the African side.

Clint Dempsey set a national record by scoring after just 32 seconds - the fastest an American has ever scored a World Cup goal.

The U.S. and Germany are now level-pegging at the top of Group G with one win each, while Ghana and Portugal are at the bottom.

Ghana dominated much the rest of the game, making a total of 21 shots, but only scored one goal when Andre Ayew leveled in the 82nd minute.

Just four minutes later, Brooks - a 21-year-old who came on at halftime because Matt Besler was injured â€” scored off a corner from Graham Zusi. It was the first time an American sub had ever scored in the World Cup.

Dempsey's goal made him the first U.S. player to score in three different World Cups and was the fastest ever scored by an American in the tournament.

Dempsey's goal showed the kind of technical flair seldom seen from a squad that typically scores through set pieces.

Brooks' game winner came in the waning minutes as the Americans were desperately trying to survive waves of attacks from Ghana.

DaMarcus 
Beasley, who became the first American to play in four World Cups, 
started the buildup to Dempsey's goal with a pass to Jermaine Jones, who
 fed it to Dempsey inside the penalty area.

With
 a nifty move to split defenders John Boye and Sulley Muntari, Dempsey 
sent the left-footed shot past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey, where the ball 
bounced off the post and in.

That was quick: Clint Dempsey scored 32 seconds into the U.S. World Cup team's game against Ghana on Monday

U.S.A.: Beating Ghana was a welcome revenge for the U.S. team, after Ghana has knocked the Americans out of the last two World Cups

Already ahead after the game had barely started, the Americans looked well on their way to erasing eight years of frustration caused by Ghana.

Ghana regrouped at halftime and the U.S. looked punchless on the attack after losing striker Jozy Altidore to an apparent hamstring injury in the 21st minute.

Ghana applied relentless pressure on U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard and finally drew even when captain Asamoah Gyan flicked a backheel pass to Ayew, who used the outside of his left foot for a powerful shot.

Ghana was still pressing for a winner Brooks delivered the header. He appeared shocked to have scored, raising his hands to his head before falling to the ground to be mobbed by his teammates.

Meanwhile, fans across the U.S. - and across the globe - are celebrating the win over the team that dashed their World Cup hopes in the previous two tournaments.

Special message: President Barack Obama posted a video on Twitter prior to Monday's game wishing the team luck

Vice President Joe Biden was on hand at the stadium in Natal to cheer on the U.S. team. The vice president even had his own jersey made, with the name '@VP' stitched into the back above the number 14.

Earlier in the day, President Barack Obama 'tweeted' a video of himself giving some words of encouragment to the U.S. team.

'Go team USA,' the president says in the video. 'Show the world what we're made of.'
