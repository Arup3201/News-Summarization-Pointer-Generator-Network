West Ham will have to up their off to £10million if they want to sign Sadio Mane.

Manager Sam Allardyce is keen on the Senegal winger who has also been watched by Newcastle and Manchester City but they may struggle to match his club Red Bull Salzburg's valuation.

West Ham have offered £5.2m with add-ons but Salzburg want more if they are to lose the 22-year-old who scored 17 goals last season.
