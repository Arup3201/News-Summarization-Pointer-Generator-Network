Missing: Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick went missing on May 19 and her body has still not been recovered

Investigators have found human remains that may be those of Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, a college student who vanished in May, police have revealed.

'We believe these remains are Mickey Shunick's, but we are not 100 per cent,' Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft told The Advertiser on Tuesday.

Tests are needed to identify the remains, he said.

The Shunick family cannot say whether the body is hers 'until an official press release is made by the proper officials,' said a statement released by Margaret Bearb, a volunteer coordinator close to the family.

'Also, we ask that you please respect the Shunick family by allowing them the privacy they need at this time. It has been, and still is, a long journey in the search to find Mickey, so we truly feel that they deserve some time alone until they are ready to respond to the current rumor,' the statement said.

Shunick, a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, disappeared May 19, days before she turned 22. She was last seen riding away from a friend's house on black Schwinn bicycle, which was found in a swampy area at a highway exchange 25 miles away.

Property outside of Lafayette Parish was being investigated in connection with Shunick's disappearance, but the location won't be released while the investigation continues, said Cpl. Paul Mouton, a police spokesman.

Brandon Lavergne, a 33-year-old 
registered sex offender from Swords, has been charged with both her 
kidnapping and murder and with the 1999 death of Lisa Ann Pate.

Prosecutors said in court filings 
last week that Lavergne may have moved both bodies and that 'continued 
tampering' with Shunick's body was meant to hamper the investigation.

St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby 
Guidroz said Lavergne's arrest came as his department helped Lafayette 
police search the sex offender's residence for evidence.

The search has been ongoing since July, but the sheriff had no details on what was
found.

The
rural St. Landry address where the search was conducted is listed as 
the address of Lavergne on the state's sex offender website.

The website says Lavergne was convicted in 2000 of aggravated oral sexual battery. He was released in 2008.

Continued search: The case engulfed the entire area and continues to absorb attention

Empty trail: Her bicycle was found eight days later in a remote, swampy area under a highway bridge in Iberville Parish, about 25 miles from the spot where she was last seen

He
was reportedly on probation until 2010, and is listed as a Tier 3 sex 
offender, the most serious classification. Tier 3 offenders must 
register with the national sex offender registry for life, according to 
the sex offender website.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home on the day of her disappearance on May 19.

Her bicycle was found eight days 
later in a remote, swampy area under a highway bridge in Iberville 
Parish, about 25 miles from the spot where she was last seen.

Soon after her disappearance, 
Lafayette police released video taken about the time she went missing. 
It showed her cycling on a Lafayette street around 1.45am on May 19.

Investigators said at the time that they were seeking information about a pickup truck seen on the video.

The sex offender website shows a white 2011 Chevrolet Silverado under vehicles linked to Lavergne.

Volunteers at the Find Mickey Shunick headquarters in the nearby South College Shopping Centre were told of the news last night.

Co-ordinator
Margaret Bearb said: 'It's almost like we all took a deep breath. This 
is the first time since this happened that the family has been able to 
take a breath.'

'I think it's more of a shock than anything else. We're on our 47th day, and here we are.'

And Shunick's sister, Charlie, told thetowntalk.com via text message that: 'We are relieved that the police have made an arrest.

'The circumstances are pretty distressing. If she is gone, it is a void in the fabric of the world and a devastating blow to our family.'

According to Louisiana law, first-degree murder includes 'the killing of a human being - when the offender has specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration of aggravated kidnapping'.

Reward: Her friends issued a 
$25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her 
whereabouts

Best friends: Mickey and her sister, pictured in happier times before she went missing

The law defines aggravated kidnapping as 'the forcible seizing and carrying of any person from one place to another; or the enticing or persuading of any person to go from one place to another; or the imprisoning or forcible secreting of any person.'

If a district attorney seeks a capital verdict in a first-degree murder case, the crime can come with a sentence of death or life in prison.
