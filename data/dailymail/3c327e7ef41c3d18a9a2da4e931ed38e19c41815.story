A father's lasting tribute to his little girl was deemed too offensive by an Australian pub, which asked the man to leave for violating its 'no face and neck tattoo' policy.

Andrew Lester, a 30-year-old professional photographer, was asked to leave the Alma Tavern in Adelaide while enjoying a meal with friends on Saturday night.

Two security guards approached his table and gave him an ultimatum: cover up the large tattoo which reads 'Love Is Blind' - a tribute to his little girl - or leave.

Love Is Blind: Andrew Lester's tattoo is a tribute to his young daughter, who was left blind by optic nerve damage, and was deemed offensive by an Adelaide pub

Andrew was told by two security guards to cover up the tattoo with band-aids - while enjoying dinner with friends

Mr Lester, angered by the pub's actions, posted an angry message on the Alma Tavern's Facebook page (below). The post has since been removed but dozens of punters have added messages of support to other posts on the page.

'I was honestly absolutely shocked, I was just laughing and said ‘you can’t be serious, surely that can’t be something that happens’, and they said I had to cover it up with a band-aid,' he told The Advertiser.

Mr Lester was inked with the tattoo, which looms large on the right side of his neck, 18 months ago as a reminder of his daughter Juno's numerous health problems.

Juno had just been diagnosed with optic nerve damage, leaving her blind.

'It was part of the healing process for me after receiving that diagnosis to say I’m proud of my daughter,' he said.

'It’s something that I want to be open about, which is part of the reason I chose to put it on my neck so when I’m with my daughter people can see it and understand the significance.'

Mark Ricciuto (L), former captain of the Adelaide Crows AFL team, is a co-owner of the pub and himself sports several large back tattoos; Dustin Martin (R) is one of a number of high-profile footballers with a neck tatt

The pub is co-owned by former Adelaide Crows AFL captain Mark Ricciuto, who himself sports a number of large back tattoos.

Mr Lester told the Mail Online he has since met with Mr Ricciuto, and while the pair have 'agreed to disagree' on the pub's policy, they have shaken hands over the incident.

'He's an awesome bloke. He copped a lot over the past couple of days,' Mr Lester said.

'I want to set it straight that it was in no way a personal attack. It's just an argument over policy. It has nothing to do with my daughter.'

Mr Lester was planning to issue another Facebook post to declare an end to the feud, which he says has forced the club to review its stance on tattoos.

'They believe it's crucial to the safety of their patrons, that from their experience people with tattoos on their face, neck or head are more likely to cause trouble,' he added.

'I've never had any issues in the past. It came as such a shock.

After returning home from the pub, Andrew posted this angry message on the Alma Tavern's Facebook page - demanding a formal apology

Apology: The club says it's sorry Andrew was left embarrassed by the situation and asks to meet him in person

'I can't see the problem with it. It's not something I've come up against before.'

Several high-profile Australian athletes and celebrities have neck tattoos, including Richmond AFL player Dustin Martin, Cronulla NRL player Todd Carney and former Australian Idol winner Stan Walker.

Mr Lester's initial Facebook message read: 'I’m married with three kids and own my own business in the CBD so I am a respectable member of society, and to be treated like Im some sort of criminal really rubs me up the wrong way, simply because I decided to put a tattoo on my neck.'

He posted a link on his own Facebook profile and encouraged his friends to get involved, saying 'Pls comment and share guys, this really p***ed me off'.

The pub later messaged Mr Lester to apologise.

Mr Ricciuto said: 'I understand his tattoo was one involves his daughter and is a sad story but security don't look at the individual detail of tattoos.

''We're sorry for the embarrassment caused to him.'
