Paris may
lose its trademark glow next year after plans emerged to extinguish its street
lighting at night to save money.

French
President Francois Hollande and his energy minister Delphine Batho are considering turning out the lights in and outside public buildings, offices and
shops in the early hours of the morning.

If the scheme
goes ahead, late-night revellers in the city would be advised to carry torches if
they venture out between the hours of 1 and 7am.

The rules
will also apply to other French cities, villages, and towns.

Batho said
the measure would save energy and money, and show 'sobriety', although the plan
has proved unpopular with traders.

It follows on from a new rule last July which states businesses must turn off neon lights 
between 1 and 6am. The measure was introduced as part of the French government's bid to improve its energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2020.

But the proposal was not popular with businesses, who believe that it could kill trade and discourage tourists.

'Visitors and locals follow the light, from one spot to another, all night long,' French chef and culinary consultant Didier Quemener told Quartz.

France was visited by more than 81 million tourists in 2011 and the tourism industry employs some 900,000 people, according to government figures cited by Bloomberg.com.

Fearing for the impact on the economy, vice-president of France’s Commerce Council, Sofy Mulle, told Bloomberg there must be a better way.

She said: 'Surely we can work out environmentally friendly solutions that have less impact on our society and economy.'

The plan is already in place at the city’s more than 300 churches, bridges, and monuments, including the Eiffel Tower.

 'One of our main objectives is to change the culture,' energy minister Batho told a French TV station.

'We need to end the cycle of producing more because we are consuming more. There should be sobriety in energy use.'
