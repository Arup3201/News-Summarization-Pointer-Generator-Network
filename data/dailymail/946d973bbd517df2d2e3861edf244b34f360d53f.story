The idea is simple - destroy as much as possible.

Welcome to the Rage Room, where those with something on their chest can go to lighten their load.

Developed by two Serbian teenagers, customers are handed a baseball and hardhat, before unleashing on lamps, beds, tables and any other unfortunate piece of furniture.

Preparing for battle: A customer grips a baseball bat at the Rage Room, in Novi Sad, Serbia, opened by two Serbian teenagers

Off his chest: The customer, wearing obligatory hardhat, protective gloves and glasses, begins his $6 session

The Rage Room has drawn a flurry of 
attention since it opened in the northern Serbian 
city of Novi Sad in October, where two decades of war, political 
crisis and economic hardship have driven many people over the edge.

The teenage proprietors were inspired by a similar 'Anger Room' in 
Dallas, Texas, who thought a Serbian version would be a surefire way to make money.

The Dallas version costs up to $75 per
session and has an array of objects to destroy, including computers and
office furniture.

But the Serbian alternative, housed in a refurbished 
garage, is much more basic.

For $6 customers, who are required to wear protective gloves, glasses and a helmet, can smash a coat-rack, chair, bookshelf, 
and other items such as framed photographs, empty cans and plastic 
containers.

After the destruction, they get to unwind with relaxing music, leaving the clean-up to 
staff.

Mess: The Rage Room, is housed in a former garage, and customer usually spend five minutes completing their destruction

'On average, we have one person a day,
enough to keep us going,' says Nikola Pausic, an 18-year-old who runs 
the room with a friend.

'Dozens have come so far, people of all ages.'

He said that visitors, who have included a number of women, usually need about five minutes to destroy 
everything inside.

While it may be an easy way to let off
steam, experts warn that projects like this are no replacement for 
anger management therapy.

Sanja Marjanovic, a psychologist from 
Belgrade, said that modern science looks for ways to control 
frustrations before they explode into full-blown rage.

She explained 
that 'venting anger does give you an immediate sense of relief but in 
the long run, one becomes accustomed to feeling angry'.

Preparation: Nikola Pausic, who runs the company with a friend, arranges furniture and other household items before a demolishing session begins

Medically untested: A sign advertising the Rage Room. After the session customers are given a CD that includes information about professional therapists and how to contact them

'In a stressful situation, one can 
count to ten, or take calm, deep breaths. It's much more 
useful to practice yoga.'

Pausic said each visitor must sign a 
document that includes a clause saying the Rage Room does not aspire to 
offer medical assistance.

After the session is over, 
customers are given a CD that includes information about professional 
therapists and how to contact them.

After his session, panting customer Savo Duvnjak, 18, says: 'This feels so good!'

He adds: 'I feel I let go of all my negative energy. This last year was a tough one and I wanted to end it with a bang.'

He said the session helped to take 
off some of the pressure that had built up in his studies - adding that 
many of his friends felt the same way.

'This is better than getting into a fight,' he concluded.
