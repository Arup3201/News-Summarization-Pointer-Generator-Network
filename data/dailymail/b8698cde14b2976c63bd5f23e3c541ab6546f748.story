The most-loved Barbie doll and Lego toys have been toppled by an Australian toy company.

One of the fastest-growing toy manufacturers in the US, Moose Toys, won the 2015 Girl Toy of the Year Awards at the Toy of the Year Awards ceremony in New York on Friday night.

Up against a slew of international goliaths, Shopkins Small Mart triumphed over the likes of Barbie manufacturers Mattel, The Lego Group and Disney Princess to win the award.

Moose Toys Co-CEO Paul Solomon told Daily Mail Australia it was an incredible honour and an acknowledgement to take out the toughest category usually dominated by toy manufacturing giants.

'The TOTY Awards is like the Oscars for our industry so it's the ultimate award to win and we're incredibly proud to achieve it,' Mr Solomon said.

'We're up against the powerhouses and the monster entertainment toy giants so it's a great Australian success story and an enormous feat to bring home.'

More than 65 million Shopkins have now sold worldwide, with limited edition characters, normally retailing from $2.99, now selling upwards of $1,500 each on US eBay.

Shopkins have taken the world by storm in the seven months since their launch. 

'We're quite unique in Australia because we create and manufacture our own products and they're distributed to more than 100 countries over the world,' Mr Solomon said.

'It's great to see people are collecting and trading online - and to see the rare characters going for $1500 on eBay shows how demanding they are.'

Designed and developed by the Moose team from their head office in Cheltenham, Melbourne, Moose Toys is family-owned and has been in the business for more than 25 years.

'A lot of time and energy have been put into these toys by our talented team and we're very proud,' Mr Solomon said.

'One of the things we do have a lot of expertise in is collectable toys so we're always on the look-out for the most popular trends and what themes work best for the children.

'Miniature toys are a huge trend and we noticed children love collecting, trading and doing role plays - like in real life in a store.

'Trends are changing on a regular basis and children are always changing every year so it's important that we must always continue to bring out the exciting and innovative toys over the years.'

Moose has products in all toy categories including collectibles, arts and crafts, activity toys, dolls, novelty items and outdoor products, and has brought joy to kids worldwide with successful products such as Mighty Beanz, Beados, Aqua Sand and The Trash Pack.

'We have a secret product launching in October but we're keeping it under wraps at the moment. There are some exciting introduction and new things so keep your eyes peeled.

Mr Solomon added: 'We also signed a deal with a major entertainment company for a Shopkins cartoon series and is set to release in 2016 - it's a huge achievement to be a part of.'

American TIA vice president of marketing communications Ken Seiter said the TOTY Award winners are chosen out of hundreds of submissions by a panel of toy experts.

'The toys selected are judged to be the most creative, unique, innovative, special toys of the year.

'We’re thrilled to recognize the Shopkins Small Mart as this year’s ‘Girl’s Toy of the Year’ as it inspires creativity and encourages imaginative play, which plays a crucial role in the development of children.'

The brand has also attracted a strong online fan base, garnering 13 million views of Shopkins webisodes and over 400 million views on Shopkins fan videos.
