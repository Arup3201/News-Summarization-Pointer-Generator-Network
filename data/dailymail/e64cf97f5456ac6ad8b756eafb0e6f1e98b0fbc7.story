Annie Power’s last hurdle fall in Tuesday’s OLBG Mares’ Hurdle has been described as the fall that saved the bookmaking industry a £40million payout by a Ladbrokes spokesman.

A loss out on scale similar to that when Frankie Dettori went through the card with seven winners at Ascot in 1996 looked on the cards as punters piled cash won on the first three winners of the day trained in Ireland by Willie Mullins – Douvan, Un De Sceaux and Champion Hurdle winner Faugheen – on to 1-2 favourite Annie Power.

She was well clear and heading to victory before she hit the deck with jockey Ruby Walsh. Thankfully, both Annie Power and Walsh emerged seemingly none the worse. L'Unique was another faller, but also got up.

Even though Annie Power's Mullins-trained stablemate and 6-1 shot Glens Melody won the race to add to his domination of day one of the meeting, she was not as well backed.

David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'Had Annie Power won we were facing up to the worse day’s betting in our history. We were looking at a pay-out in the region of £50m.

‘We estimate the industry loss is still £10m but we have dodged the most expensive betting bullet ever. It has turned out to be a bad day at the office rather than an horrendous one.'

Walsh said of Annie Power: 'I don't know why she did it. She was a bit far away and came down under the top bar and turned over. That's racing, that happens.

'It's been a super day. Douvan was great, Un De Sceaux was brilliant, Faugheen winning the Champion Hurdle was magic. At least Annie Power got up and there'll be another day.'
