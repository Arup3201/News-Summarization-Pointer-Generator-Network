We've all been there. The involuntary pained facial expression that comes with drinking a shot of a straight spirit.

Now one London photographer has captured the unavoidable squirm in a series of photographs.

Tim Charles' Shot Face series captures 34  priceless facial expressions before, during, and after knocking back a shot of tequila.

Tim Charles created the photo series, Shot Face, where he took a picture of his subjects after drinking a shot

The subjects were photographed before, during and after drinking their shot

From the gritting of teeth to a gasping tongue, for anyone who has ever had that immediate intense regret that comes with a round of shots will be able to relate to these images.

The 33-year-old photographer, who is originally from Norfolk, found his group of willing subjects for the photo experiment in unconventional ways.

Half were friends of Tim's (and the photographer even took part himself) and others he found on casting websites and by placing adverts on Gumtree and Craigslist.

Subjects were given one shot of tequila however Tim also provided gin and sambuca in case they were particularly offended by the spirit

The project was done over two sittings between June and July earlier this year. The photographer says he mainly gave the participants tequila, however as some people had developed a severe aversion to the drink, he also had Sambuca and gin as a backup. 

Tim came up with the inspiration behind the project while on a night out doing shots himself and wanted to capture the unpleasant experience on camera.  

'I'm not sure where we were (not because of drinking too much!), but it was in London and it was around mid-March.'

Tim was inspired to create the series after seeing his girlfriend's reaction in a bar

For half of Tim's subjects he recruited his friends to take part

Tim says that he has his girlfriend to thank especially for pulling the most spectacular grimace. 

'Someone had the bright idea to get a round of shots in and after watching my girlfriend pull the most grimacing face I can ever imagine someone pull, I immediately thought this would be a great project to do. 

This image of Elsa was Tim’s favourite as he says it looks as though she is begging for mercy

'So I guess I can thank her and her grimace! It was such a raw form of expression, a face that people can't really control and also a moment that is actually quite socially common.' 

When putting the idea into motion, Tim wasn't sure how many people he would be able to recruit but he says he was pleasantly surprised.  

The other half of his subjects were  discovered through websites such as Craigslist and Gumtree

'The response from the adverts was great, which I was happy about as I was unsure anyone would want their photograph taken by a photographer they've never met who's going to give them alcohol! Not dodgy at all.'

Although Tim says that many of the first images taken captured the priceless reactions he was after, a few of his subjects insisted on having a second take. 

Tim even took part in the project himself pulling this objectionable face

'I was made to do one, I guess I couldn't make my friends do it without doing one myself. For the most part everyone was only photographed once and it was this first reaction I wanted. 

'That said there are a couple who demanded another shot (at around 2 in the afternoon!), they shall remain anonymous.' 

Tim says he has quite a few favourite photos from the series, even some that did not immediately stand out to him, have become favourites. 

Tim, who has always had an avid interest in art and photography, studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography

'You start to appreciate some of the subtleties people display. My original favourite is the one of Elena (in the pink and white top), I love the way her arm is up in the air, almost as if she's saying "stop" or "give me a minute", it always makes me laugh when I see it.' 

Tim, who has always had an avid interest in art and photography, studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography. 

'However much I enjoyed my course it became obvious that I was lacking creativity in my life, this is when I picked up my camera again and it just felt right. I was soon spending more time taking pictures than attending my course!' 

Subjects only needed to pose for one photo but some insisted on a second take
