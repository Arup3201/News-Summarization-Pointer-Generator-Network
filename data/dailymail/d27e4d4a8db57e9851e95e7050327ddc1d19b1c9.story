Nick Cleg is being urged by Lib Dems to woo eastern European immigrants to avoid electoral wipe out in elections in May.

Issan Ghazni, a candidate to become an MEP in the East Midlands, claimed securing the support of people from eastern European could make the difference between the party winning or losing.

The chairman of Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats also warned many people from overseas did not though they had a vote.

The Lib Dems risk facing wipeout on May 22 when voters take part in elections to the European Parliament.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage – who has been outspoken in his criticism of immigration from eastern European - has predicted his party will win the most votes, triggering a ‘political earthquake’.

But Mr Ghazni claims the party could avoid annihilation by winning over people from countries like Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia.

He said: ‘Doomsday predictions in the media that Liberal Democrats are set to lose all our MEPs to UKIP are wide of the mark.

‘The closer we get to the Euro elections in May the greater the opportunity for us to win support from the substantial minority of voters who are pro-Europe.’

EU citizens can vote in European and local elections in the UK, elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies and some referendums but are not able to vote in UK Parliamentary general elections. 

People from the following countries living in the UK can vote on May 22:

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

He admitted that the threat of Ukip is a ‘substantial one’ and pressure from Mr Farage means the Lib Dems ‘need to get smarter’.

Mr Ghazni said he recently visited ‘five Eastern European coffee shops’ in the town of Boston in the East Midlands to talk with migrant workers.

‘As soon as they heard the Lib Dems’ pro-Europe message of supporting the free movement of goods and labour they were eager to vote for us,’ he wrote for LibDemVoice.

‘People in the cafes told me they were fearful of the anti-immigration rhetoric of UKIP and the Tory Right, and many would enthusiastically support the Lib Dems if only we made contact with them. We must, for they could hold the key to fending off UKIP and make the difference between keeping or losing our MEPs.

‘Eastern Europeans will become more established in future decades. Securing their support today, at a time when they are repelled by the anti-immigration climate, will serve us well in future elections. And it may just take us over the winning post in May.’

trigger a political 'earthquake' by topping the Euro elections, while 
David Cameron is under pressure from Eurosceptics in the Tory party see 
off the threat of Ukip

A YouGov opinion poll last month Labour on course to come first, with Ukip in second followed by the Conservatives.

Labour was on 32 per cent and Ukip on 26 per cent, with the Tories trailing on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats a distant fourth on 9 per cent.

If the findings were repeated on May 22 with a uniform swing, they would see Conservative representation at the European Parliament slashed by 11 to 15 MEPs.

The Conservatives are on course to come third in the elections to the European Parliament in May, behind Labour and Ukip. YouGov interviewed 1,893 adults for The Sun on January 14 and 15

Labour would have 28 (up 15), Ukip 23 (up 10), and the Lib Dems' 11 MEPs would be completely wiped out.

A Lib Dem spokesman rejected the idea the party would be wiped out, and insisted Mr Ghazni’s ideas were not party policy.

‘It is a suggestion from a single candidate. Our campaign will be based on making the case that we are the only party prepared to unambiguously make the case for Britain in Europe.

‘We hope to appeal to the many people across the UK who believe Britain is better off in the European Union.

‘Europe needs reform but being in Europe means we have a stronger economy with millions of British jobs protected, we can catch criminals who cross our borders and work with our European neighbours to tackle climate change.’
