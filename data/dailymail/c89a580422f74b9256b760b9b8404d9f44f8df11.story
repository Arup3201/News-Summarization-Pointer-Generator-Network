When Kellie Bohrer saw a Siberian Husky for sale for just $320 online - about $700 cheaper than the market rate - she thought it was too good to be true.

She should have trusted her instinct.

The 19-year-old is now more than $3000 out-of-pocket and without a puppy after falling victim to an online 'Nigerian-style' scam which authorities say is becoming increasingly common.

Cheated: Scammers sent Kellie Bohrer this picture of a Siberian Husky which she thought she had purchased

'I really didn't understand what was happening': Kellie Bohrer is $3000 out of pocket and without a dog after being tricked by online puppy scammers

Bohrer, from Colorado, told CBS 4 she contacted the seller after seeing an advertisement for a purebred Husky on dogoodle.com.

She thought it was a good deal, as these dogs normally sell for at least $1000.

The seller sent her cute pictures of the dog and an authentic-looking registration certificate.

But then the trouble started.

Bohrer said the agency called and needed $1600 upfront for insurance to ship the dog from Washington state to Bohrer's Aurora home. The seller said the money would be reimbursed on delivery.

But instead of a puppy, Bohrer got another email seeking $1000 for vaccinations and to pay a new carrier.

Another email followed, demanding $4500 to get the dog out of 'puppy quarantine' in Las Vegas.

'We’re like this isn’t right,' Bohrer said.

Tricks of the trade: The fraudulent 'seller' sent Kellie Bohrer photos of the dog and a registration certificate which looked authentic

'Don't have an emotional attachment': FBI spokesman Dave Joly said consumers should treat online all sales like a 'business transaction' to avoid scammers

The registration certificate was similar to those issued by American Pet Registry, but contained multiple errors.

CBS4 did a reverse search on the 
pictures and found the same puppies for sale in Texas, Virginia, 
North Carolina and overseas.

The seller also used a false identity.

'Being 19, I really didn’t understand what was happening,' a tearful Bohrer said.

'I don’t want other people to suffer.'

Federal Bureau of Investigations spokesman Dave Joly said consumers had to do their research to avoid scammers.

'Treat this as a business transaction. Don’t have an emotional attachment to anything that you’re purchasing,' he said.

'The first rule of thumb is if something appears to be too good to be true, it mostly likely is.'

More information about online scams is available on the Internet Crime Complaint Center website via fbi.gov.
