In 1977, William McPherson earned the top honor in the writing world when he was honored with a Pulitzer Prize.  

But nearly four decades later, the former Washington Post critic now hovers on the brink of poverty  thanks to a failing pension and a bit of bad luck on the stock market.

In a heartbreaking essay for The Hedgehog Review, McPherson describes what it's like to become poor in old age - as part of a overlooked group who are neither middle or lower class. 

Former teachers and even lawyers who can't pay their bills but aren't on the streets begging for change.

Surprisingly, he says the experience has been educational and that he still considers himself privileged due to his race.

What it's like to be poor: Pulitzer Prize winning writer William McPherson (pictured) wrote a heartbreaking essay about his descent into poverty 

'Compared with most poor people, I am fortunate,' he wrote. 'If you’ve got to be poor, finding yourself at the upper edge of poverty with a roof over your head and a wardrobe that doesn’t look as if it came from the Salvation Army is as good as it gets. 

'It also helps to be white.'

McPherson relays a terrible anecdote in which his former personal trainer Jeff, who is African-American, sees a client walking on the street.

When he tried to greet her, the woman immediately wrote him off and said 'I don't have any, I don't have any money'. She didn't even look up to recognize the man she saw regularly at the gym. 

'She didn't see Jeff; she saw a black man in trainers about to ask her for a handout on one of the busier avenues in the city. Jeff doesn’t look like a hustler. He doesn’t look poor. I don’t look poor, either, but I am white. So I never suffered that kind of demeaning slight.' 

McPherson started at the Washington Post as a copy boy but worked his way up to book editor during his 25 off-and-on years at the paper. 

Seventeen years into his tenure at the Post, McPherson left to work at a New York publishing agency - just a year before profit-sharing would have taken effect. Eventually, the Post's editor coaxed McPherson back to journalism where he went to cover Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism and win a Pulitzer Prize for this critical writing. 

It was when he decided to leave for Europe that McPherson's first financial problems started happening - but he didn't know their repercussions at the time. 

Worthless: The 81-year-old spent 25 years working at the Washington Post, but after deciding to take an early retirement in 1986, his pension is now worth half what he saved 

Against the advice of more stock market-saavy friends, McPherson invested in AOL before it was popular and Apple when the tech company was at a low. He made good money when both stocks bounded, but lost that money when he handed over his capital to a manager to travel Europe.

Like many Americans, he lost a lot of money when the stock market crashed. 

Then, in 1986, when McPherson was in the middle of a leave of absence, the Post asked him to either come back to work or take an early retirement.

'I was fifty-three at the time. I chose retirement because I was under the illusion—perhaps delusion is the more accurate word—that I could make a living as a writer and the Post offered to keep me on their medical insurance program, which at the time was very good and very cheap,' McPherson wrote.

However, that choice proved costly since by the time his pension kicked in at age 65, the money he had saved on the Post's 401(k) plan was half it's worth since it is not adjusted for inflation.  

While McPherson's $11,670 income puts him above the poverty line (which last year was a close $11,490), he still considers himself poor 'by any rational standard'. 

He is forced to live in subsidized housing, with neighbors including a great-grandson of Leo Tolstoy, former lawyers, academics and fellow writers.

The District of Columbia is also subsidizing his medical insurance payments, after a  major heart attack left him with astronomical bills. 

However, he doesn't blame his misfortune on the economy.

When he was younger he says he was 'foolish, careless and sometimes stupid' spending money without thinking of the long-term consequences. 

While he doesn't regret any of it, he doesn't like having to rely on his family for so much now that he is older. 

'Sometimes, I find it deeply humiliating that I am dependent on such kindnesses when I would prefer that the kindnesses flow the other way. Most of the time, though, I am just extremely grateful for the help of family and friends. It’s not so much humiliating as it is humbling, which is a good thing.'
