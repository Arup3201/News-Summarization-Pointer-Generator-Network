Drinks giant Coca-Cola has apologised to a family after it found 'You Retard' printed inside a bottle cap.

Blake Loates, from Alberta, Canada, was shocked to read the insulting profanity as she drank from the low-calorie fruit drink.

'We immediately thought, you have got to be kidding me?' she told the Huffington Post Alberta.

'We thought it might been a disgruntled employee or someone in a (bottling) plant playing a joke,' she added.

Blake Loates sent this photo to her father Doug, who was appalled at the apparent insult printed in her daughter's soft drink

Appalled, she took a photo of the lid and its printed insult and sent it to her father, Doug Loates, who immediately penned a letter to the mega-firm.

In the letter, seen by the Huffington Post, he told the company, '... the "R" word is considered a swear word in our family. We don't use it. We don't tolerate others using it around us. We ARE over-sensitive but you would be too if you had Fiona for a daughter!'

He explained that he has two young daughters, both born premature and consequently suffer disabilities, and two older daughters, including Blake, from his first marriage.

He says through his daughters he has leaned to 'give', 'care' and 'enjoy small miracles'.

He questioned the Coca-Cola board of director what they would do if they found 'You Retard' printed on the bottom of a bottle cap?

Making reference to his most severely disabled daughter, Fiona, 11, he claims they too would be p*** if they had a child that needed extra care and then saw this on a bottle cap.

He questions: 'Can you imagine if SHE had opened this bottle???'

Coca-Cola apologised and said the printed words on the cap of a drink (similar to this one) were part of a competition being run by Vitamin Water, in which one French and one English word was printed

In response, Coca-Cola apologised and blamed the profanity on a competition it is currently running.

The drinks giant said it is printing at random one French and one English word on the inside of each Vitamin Water cap.

'We did not mean to offend at all,' Shannon Denny, director of brand communications for Coca-Cola Refreshment Canada, told Metro Calgary. 'We are certainly very apologetic for this oversight.'

The word 'retard' in French means to be 'late' or 'delayed'.

The company told Blake it had a system in place to review the words that were printed, but in this case it could not explain how this profanity got through, the Huffington post said.

The company told her it was recalling any remaining related products.Â
