Banned: Trenton Oldfield, 35, exchanged his wetsuit for more formal attire when he appeared in court

The protester who stopped the Boat Race was yesterday banned from the Olympic torch route and celebrations for the Queen’s Jubilee.

Trenton Oldfield, 35, appeared in court for the first time since he swam into the path of the two boats, narrowly missing the oars.The Australian spoke only to confirm his  name and address to magistrates.

The defendant, who took to Twitter 
following his arrest to speak out against privilege, showed no emotion 
as he sat beside his legal team while the charge against him was read 
out Feltham Magistrates’ Court in Middlesex.

'You are charged, on 
April 7 of this year, in the River Thames near Chiswick Eyot, with 
causing a public nuisance by swimming into the path of the University 
Boat Race and causing it to stop,' he was told.

Michael Schwarz, defending, indicated Oldfield would not enter a plea and his case was committed to crown court.

'The next hearing will be at Isleworth Crown Court,' chairman of the bench Alison Stone told the activist.

'That will be on Wednesday May 28 at 10am.'

The Australian was released on bail 
with restrictions preventing him from entering the City of Westminster 
on May 9 for the state opening of Parliament and forbidding him from 
going into the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead prior to his next
court appearance.

During this time, there are a number of events planned in the borough to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Disruption: Oldfield caused the annual contest on the River Thames to be stopped for around half an hour after he was spotted in the vessels' path as crews battled towards the finish

One condition: The Australian was released on bail with restrictions preventing him from entering the City of Westminster on May 9 for the state opening of Parliament

A further bail condition bans Oldfield
from using - or being within 100 metres of - roads which form part of 
the Olympic torch route until the same date.

Struggle: Oldfield - who lives in a run-down block of flats in east London - later defended his anti-elitist stance online, claiming he had always 'fought from within'

The
158th Boat Race on April 7 was labelled 'possibly the most dramatic in 
history' by organisers after Oldfield created unprecedented disruption.

It was the first time in its history that the event was disrupted by a swimmer.

This
year’s contest also saw an Oxford crew member break an oar before the 
team’s bowman Alex Woods collapsed after crossing the finishing line. He
was later treated in hospital.

Oldfield sparked scenes of chaos when he 
swam towards the boats as they were neck and neck between the two and 
three-mile marker.

Former rower and assistant umpire Sir
Matthew Pinsent was said to have alerted fellow adjudicators before the
race was stopped and the swimmer, who narrowly avoided the blade of an 
Oxford oar, was pulled from the river.

He was taken away on a police launch and arrested.

The race was restarted nearly half an hour later, with Cambridge powering on to victory.

Dangerous:The 35-year-old swam out to the race before getting caught under the oars of the Oxford team

Drama: The 158th Boat Race on April 7 was labelled 'possibly the most dramatic in history' by organisers after Oldfield created unprecedented disruption

It was not the first time the Boat Race has been temporarily halted.

In 2001 the competition was stopped by the umpire just over a minute after the start, following repeated warnings to both crews to move apart and then a clash of blades for which Oxford was blamed.

When the race got going, Cambridge rowed to victory.

Oldfield, who appeared relaxed during the half-hour hearing, made no comment as he left court.
