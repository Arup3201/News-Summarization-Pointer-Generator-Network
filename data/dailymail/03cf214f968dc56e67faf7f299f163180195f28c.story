Mikey Knight ordered 16 tickets for him and friends to watch Norwich City, but his mother accidentally roasted the tickets - worth around £500 in total

When Mikey Knight ordered 16 tickets  to an upcoming football match for him and his friends, he thought the safest place to get them delivered was his parents' house.

But when the 28-year-old went to the house in Taverham, Norfolk, his mother Cherry had to make a confession - she had roasted them. 

Mrs Knights had accidentally cooked the tickets, worth £500,  for 40 minutes after they got stuck to the underside of a roast in the bag chicken.

The football fan initially didn't believe his mother until she handed him an envelope containing the charred remains of 16 tickets to Good Friday's  Championship match between Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion, which were unreadable.

He said: 'I turned up for tea and my mum asked me if I was in a good mood. I said "yes."

'It was then she told me she'd roasted the tickets.

'She'd put them on the side in the kitchen ready to give to me, but when she put the bird down as she got it out the fridge the sticky bit of the envelope had opened and got stuck to it.

'She said after about 40 minutes of it cooking she couldn't find the tickets and realised what she'd done.

'I thought it was a wind-up at first, but then I opened the envelope and the 16 tickets were inside, all black.

'She told me she would sort it though. I could see the funny side but I was really worried we wouldn't be able to make it to the match.'

Mrs Knights, 62, of Norwich, went to Norwich City's grounds and explained the situation to a member of staff who then emailed Brighton and Hove Albion.

The club agreed to reprint tickets for Mr Knights and his friends as a 'goodwill gesture'.

Mr Knights added: 'I've already got my train tickets, but it's a good job those didn't go to my mum's address. She might have put them in for afters.

Mr Knights initially thought his mother was joking until she handed him the charred remains of the tickets 

'I'm going to have to collect the match tickets when I get down there.

'I'll probably have to skip the pub with my friends to go and get them, but I'm just glad we get to go and I'm really grateful.

'There wouldn't usually be this many tickets to cook, but as the match is on Good Friday more people wanted to come along. It would be awful to have let them all down.'

Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion face each other in the Championship fixture on April 3.
