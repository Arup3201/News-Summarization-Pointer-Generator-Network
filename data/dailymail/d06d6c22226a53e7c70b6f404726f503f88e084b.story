Guests at McKamey Manor are drenched in fake blood as part of the interactive experience described as the scariest in the world

Terrifying: Only two guests can be put through the petrifying ordeal at a time, with 24,000 people on the manor's waiting list

Guests have to endure coming into close contact with spiders and snakes as they attempt to make it through the haunted house

Tours of the mansion can last up to eight hours, however no one has ever made it all the way through the horrifying experience

The interactive experience has been described as a real-life horror movie, with the whole experience filmed so guests can relive their terror.

Spectators can tune in online to watch the creepy goings-on inside the mansion, with the entire haunt lasting between four and eight hours.

Due to its cinematic nature, founder Russ McKamey, 55, and his girlfriend Carol Schultz make sure no two visits are the same. 

The theme changes every year and participants have been tied up, had their heads forced into a cage of snakes, eaten rotten eggs and have even been gagged. 

Only two daredevils can enter the possessed house at once, with applicants background checked before they are granted entry. 

The whole project is run free-of-charge by Russ, who came up with the idea for the experience more than 14 years ago.

Running year-round, the haunt, which has been described as the 'world's scariest', is more about smoke and mirrors, Mr McKamey said.

A fan of  horror movies such as Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The House On Haunted Hill, Mr McKamey said the experience has been known to make grown men cry.

The couple have reportedly spent more than $500,000 on making McKamey Manor the scariest experience on Earth.

Despite Mr McKamey describing the house as PG-13, family friendly and 'like Indiana Jones on steroids', participants must be at least 21, have no serious medical conditions and sign a waiver before they enter the manor.

He said: 'Nothing is like what we do. It's like living your own horror movie.

'There are four different locations, which have been streamlined for hardcore fans, determined to make it through.

'I consider the people who take part in these haunts as my friends because I research and spend time with them before they go on the haunt.

'Everything is very interactive. The experience - and challenges - are to prove what you can and can't do.'
