A dog named Brian is at the centre of stand-off between Australia Post and residents on a street in Brisbane who have not received their mail for almost five weeks.

Australia Post turned Amaranthus Street in Runcorn, south Brisbane, into an 'exclusion zone' following an incident between a resident and a postman after the boxer escaped from his house in July.

Residents of 15 surrounding houses have since missed bills and other important letters and said they received no warning from Australia Post that their mail would not be delivered.

Allison Hansen, who lives nearby, said the situation was terrible.

'It's ludicrous, to put it bluntly,' Mrs Hansen told Daily Mail Australia.

'To punish all the other residents for one resident's dog, it's just not on.'

Mrs Hansen witnessed Brian escape his house on July 24 and went to restrain the dog and take him back to his owners.

Brian escaped his house on July 24 and jumped up and down near a postman's bike

'The dog never touched the postman, he just jumped up and down in front of bike,' she said.

'Brian thought he was being friendly but the postie may have felt threatened.'

Mrs Hansen said the postman then went to confront a female resident in the house because it was the second time Brian had escaped.

'The postman was getting aggro and bashed on the lady's door,' she said.

'She had a sick baby so she couldn't get straight out and she was trying to explain to him, then he explained this was the second time it had happened.

'It just sort of escalated from there.'

Mrs Hansen said the woman was upset and crying and rang her husband, who was on his way home. He then met up with the postie on the street.

'They were having words and the postman's helmet and the resident's cap touched, they put their heads together,' she said.

'That was the "incident".'

A spokeswoman for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia that police investigated a complaint in relation to an incident on Amaranthus Street in Runcorn on July 24.

'There was no complaint forthcoming and police have finalised the matter,' she said.

A spokeswoman for Australia post said the company had been in contact with police who confirmed they spoke with the resident this morning and the issue had been resolved.

'Australia Post is now satisfied that the safety of our postie is no longer a threat and we will resume mail delivery to residents tomorrow,' she said.

'This issue came about not as a result of a stray dog, but the physical and verbal assault of our posties.

Australia Post said it 'is now satisfied that the safety of our postie is no longer a threat and we will resume mail delivery to residents tomorrow'

'Australia Post reminds the community that the safety of our people is our highest priority and incidents of violence and intimidation will not be tolerated.'

One resident, who did not wish to be named, said the most frustrating thing about the situation had been the lack of communication from Australia Post.

'When some of the neighbours phoned up to ask about it they said "you should have been received a letter in the mail",' he told Daily Mail Australia.
