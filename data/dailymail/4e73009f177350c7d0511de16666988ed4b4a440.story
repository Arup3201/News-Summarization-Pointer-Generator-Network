Dressed in Santa hats or playing with tinsel the merry models start their careers early - aged just six weeks old.

And it's a fine art for photographer Mark Taylor, from Guildford, who has to distract the kittens and puppies just enough so they don't eat the props.

Hey, that's my hat! Photographer Mark Taylor supplies card companies and calendar makers all over the world with his cute snaps

Time for a nap: Even the coldest-hearted Scrooge would have their heart melted by these adorable Christmas animals

What a little cracker: The photographer manages to distract his subjects just long enough to get the perfect shot

Card companies and calendar makers all over the world use his work which he does following in the footsteps of his renowned photographer mother Jane Burton who passed away in 2007.

Growing up in Surrey Mr Taylor said he was surrounded by some very unusual animals his mother used to photograph.

Mr Taylor, 48, who together with dad Kim Taylor run the family firm Warren Photographic, in Guildford, said continuing his mother's work was a lovely experience.

He said: 'Growing up in Albury in Surrey as a child we used to have a tame fox, a badger, an iguana and even a type of crocodile called a caiman. The kids would love to come to our house because it was like a zoo.

Give us a slice! The photographer has mastered the art of getting different animals to work together

Peekaboo! The photographer is following in the footsteps of his renowned photographer mum Jane Burton who passed away in 2007

'I'm not sure this suits me': The photgapher said continuing his mother's work was 'a lovely experience'... although this chap doesn't look so sure

'At first I wasn't as keen on photography, we spent some time as a family in Kenya. My sister Hazel and I would spend what seemed like hours in the back of a Land Rover while mum waited to get a picture of a lion or something.

'But I actually picked up a camera about 15 years ago when I was in Canada while my ex-wife taught there, mum said to me as something to do why don't I do landscape pictures for them.

Where are the huskies when you need them? Mark Taylor has now become known as 'the master of cuteness' for his work with animals

Nuts about Christmas: This cheeky little chap won't be telling anyone where he has squirreled his presents away until the big day

'The Canadian landscape is stunning on the western coast and I think I got the bug from there. Doing the cute animal pictures now is a great privilege and I am proud to continue mum's work.'

Mark said using Christmas hats and props with his furry subjects was a challenge especially as most of the time they tried to eat them.

It wasn't us: These two look like they may been caught up in some trouble as they play with Christmas decorations

He said: 'The natural reaction of a kitten is to lift its paw up and try and take the hat off and eat the bobble.

'Luckily as well as inheriting mum's talent for cute animal pictures I also have her assistant Britta who is great at keeping them distracted just long enough to get the picture.'
