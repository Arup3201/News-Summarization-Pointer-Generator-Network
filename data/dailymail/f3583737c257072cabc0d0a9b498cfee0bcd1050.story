Whitehall officials have been caught trying to visit x-rated websites including Playboy, Only Babes and ‘Big Boobs Tight Blouse’ from work computers.

Staff at the Department for Transport tried to access porn sites dozens of times every month.

Critics said taxpayers’ time and money should be spent running the country’s roads and railways, not trying to view explicit material online.

Banned: Servers at the Department for Transport blocked dozens of visits to porn and adult website every month

Details of the sites visited by staff working for Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin emerged in response to a freedom of information request by the Daily Mirror.

Tumblr site Big Boobs Tight Blouse was visited five times, but was blocked by the ministry’s servers.

Overall there were 47 attempts to access pornography or adult content, including 14 visits to Playboy, four to ‘best free porn links’ and one to YouPorn.

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘You don’t end up on these sites by accident.

‘Taxpayers’ time and money should be spent on the job, not wasted searching for busty babes online.

‘Departments must ensure those misusing taxpayers’ resources are given the heave-ho.

‘Those civil servants should worry more about the burden of rising rail fares and less about the latest from the playboy bunnies.’

The revelation is embarrassing for Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin who would expect his staff to be focussed on roads, rail, shipping and air policy

The revelation comes after David Cameron’s long-running campaign to introduce filters to curb access to web filth.

A DFT spokesman said: ‘The department has measures in place to prevent accidental or unintentional access to unauthorised sites, such as pornographic sites.’

Last year it emerged MPs, peers and their staff spend 
thousands of hours a year on computers in Parliament looking at Facebook, buying
 Waitrose shopping and searching for new homes.

In
 contrast, websites run by government departments such as the Home 
Office and Ministry of Justice got just a handful of hits last year.

The
 figures led to accusations that politicians and their staff are 
wasting taxpayers' money enjoying 'downtime' at their desk.
