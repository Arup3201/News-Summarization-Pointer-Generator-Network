At Belvoir Castle before the war, a kitchen staff of 20 catered for the ninth Duke of Rutland and his family.

Teenage boys scrubbed copper pans, standing on duckboards to lift their feet out of the suds. Maids made everything from jam to crystallised violets.

In rare moments of leisure, the Scottish cook, Mrs Anderson, read tea leaves.

Upstairs and outside, the Duke’s butler, the housekeeper, footmen, gardeners, the pig man, wood-cutters, odd job men, nannies and nurserymaids ran the many- turreted Regency castle ‘at full throttle . . . like a cross between a luxury hotel, a museum and a theatre’, remembers Lady Ursula d’Abo. There was an upholstery workshop and, in the tack room, saddles embellished with silver.

At the centre of an estate of more than 15,000 acres, Belvoir was the Duke’s private fiefdom. His Sunday morning routine included a visit to the dairy to sample the cheese after a service in the castle chapel.

This was the world — lavish, aristocratic, rarefied — in which Lady Ursula, the eldest of the Duke’s five children and now 98-year-old great-aunt of the present 11th Duke of Rutland, spent much of her childhood.

Lady Ursula’s memories range from Downton-style Christmas parties for estate workers — at which, one year, every servant was given a gift of an orange and a lemon — to being photographed in an antique silver wine cooler large enough to hold two children.

In the castle Muniment Room, she discovered a letter from Charles II in which he addressed his downtrodden wife Catherine of Braganza as ‘my dear little whiffy-whoffy’.

Lady Ursula did not go to school, but was educated at home.

In London she took swimming, ballet and piano lessons. She was ‘finished’ in Paris. She officially ‘came out’ when she was 17, at a grand ball at Belvoir, wearing a dress by Worth.

To mark this, her father presented her with a large, heart-shaped aquamarine brooch he had designed himself. It featured her name in diamonds.

She describes her education as ‘all the traditional home pursuits: cooking, sewing and running a large house’. With hindsight, she recognises the degree to which she was spoiled, but dismisses it simply as ‘just the way it was’. As a child, Ursula envied her younger sister Isabel’s boisterous and easy manner with young men. Pale-skinned, with ink-dark hair, Ursula adored her father and felt uncomfortable with men of her own age.

From early in her life she was drawn to father figures. Later she would famously live with John Paul Getty, who asked her to marry him — she declined. In 1976, People magazine reported that Getty had left her shares worth $165,000 in his will.

There were 40,000 children at the Coronation procession in London

It was the coronation of George VI that changed her life. Ursula Manners (as she then was) was one of the train-bearers to Queen Elizabeth.

It was a nerve-racking experience, despite so many other family members also being involved: her father carried the orb, her mother carried the Queen’s canopy, two of her brothers were royal pages.

But it was Ursula who was photographed

photographs were printed in newspapers across the globe and Ursula, with
 her distinctive  widow’s peak hairline, became famous overnight.

An American magazine published a poem in which each verse began with the line: ‘Who is that beautiful Lady in Waiting?’ Celebrity, however, had never been the Duke’s aim for his daughter. He intended her to marry a man like himself, preferably another duke.

One of Lady Ursula’s boyfriends was, indeed, the future Duke of Buccleuch. Instead, she married a handsome barrister called Anthony Marreco.

After the war, they were divorced and she married her second husband, Erland d’Abo, with whom she had three children. Later Erland’s nephew Mike d’Abo became famous as the lead singer with Manfred Mann.

Aristocratic memoirs invariably combine unimaginable privilege with hefty dollops of dysfunctionalism, emotional suffering and, often, addiction or substance abuse in some shape or form.

Not so The Girl With The Widow’s Peak. Though Lady Ursula’s personal life has included its share of heartache — divorce, widowhood, the death of the father she idolised aged only 53, and a car crash that involved extensive reconstructive facial surgery — her autobiography depicts a happy family existence. It is a precious window on to a vanished world.
