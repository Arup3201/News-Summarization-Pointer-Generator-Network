We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Catherine Zeta-Jones' arms.

The Welsh beauty looked stunning at her most recent red-carpet outing, wearing a strapless gown with lean arms on display.

The 45-year-old actress works out daily: 'I have a ballet barre in my gym. I turn up the music so loud the walls are pulsating and I go at it for an hour.'

She also swims for 45 minutes most days, walks on the treadmill, stretches and uses an elliptical training machine. Regular hula-hooping also helps keep her in shape.

What to try: 

Dumb-bell pullovers will result in fantastic toned arms. You will need a dumb-bell or a bottle of water. 

Lie on your back on a bench, holding the weight with both hands. 

Slowly lift the weight above your head, arms almost straight and lower the weight behind your head by bending the elbows. Return to the start position and repeat the entire move 12 to 15 times.
