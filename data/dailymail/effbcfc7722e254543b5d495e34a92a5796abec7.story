It is a fixture weighted in World Cup history; two finals, red cards, mass brawls, humiliations, penalty shootouts and more.

Argentina versus Germany will climax the latest edition of football’s showcase tournament in Rio's Maracana Stadium on Sunday.

It will be the third time they have met in the final – a record – having clashed in 1986 and 1990, and seventh time in total.

Crowning moment: Diego Maradona lifts the trophy following Argentina's 3-2 victory over West Germany at Mexico 86

There has been no shortage of incident, either.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at their previous World Cup encounters, starting with the two finals…

Italia 90 Final: West Germany 1 Argentina 0

Let us deal with the minor details first; West Germany won 1-0 thanks to an Andreas Brehme penalty five minutes from time.

For this final will forever be remembered for the savagery of the South Americans, and this from a team which included Diego Maradona.

The captain, however, was complicate in the underhand tactics of his side, who were intent on spoiling their way through to penalty kicks.

By the time Brehme’s winner arrived, Argentina were already down to 10 men, Pedro Monzon the first man in the history of the World Cup to be sent off in a final, a crude chop on Jurgen Klinsmann his crime.

Gustavo Dezotti followed him for a second bookable offence three minutes from time and the Argentinean shame was complete.

Mexico 86 Final: Argentina 3 West Germany 2

Despite being contested in the searing midday heat of Mexico City, the two teams still found the fervour to share six bookings, which was a record until 2010.

Happily, however, this final will be remembered for the five goals they also shared and the crowning of the marvellous Maradona as world champion.

Argentina were 2-0 up thanks to Jose Luis Brown and Jorge Valdano with just 15 minutes remaining.

But the introduction of powerhouse frontman Dieter Hoeness - brother of Uli - had unsettled the South Americans and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Rudi Voller capitalised to draw Germany level.

As Rummenigge later recalled, however, they were greedy and chased victory, affording Maradona a momentary yard to unpick their backline and spring Jorge Burruchaga clear and he did the rest with a cool finish six minutes from the end.

South Africa 2010 Quarter-Final: Germany 4 Argentina 0

File this one under ‘humiliation’, for Maradona’s Argentina were out-thought and out-fought by the young Germans - and the majority of the protagonists will again take to the stage in Rio on Sunday.

Indeed, as many as 18 players involved in Cape Town are likely to feature in this weekend’s final.

Head boy: Thomas Muller heads Germany into an early lead in Cape Town

Net gains: Miroslav Klose strikes late on to seal the 4-0 victory

Germany had already crushed England 4-1 in the last 16 but this was even more emphatic, especially given the favouritism of an Argentina side boasting a front three of Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain.

It took just three minutes for Thomas Muller to head the opener and, while Argentina did threaten parity early in the second half, Germany put the tie to rest with two goals in six minutes courtesy of Miroslav Klose and Arne Friedrich. Klose volleyed a fourth late on to compound Maradona’s misery.

Germany 2006 Quarter-Final: Germany 1 Argentina 1 (Germany won 4-2 on penalties)

Memory of this meeting exists outside the confine of 120 minutes – in which Klose had equalised Roberto Ayala’s headed opener - and for a penalty shootout and subsequent brawl which was, predictably, coined the Battle of Berlin. 

Spot-kick misses from Ayala and Esteban 
Cambiasso were punished by four successful German efforts but an 
ill-tempered melee ensued in which Argentina substitute Leandro Cufre 
was sent off.

England 1966 Group Stage: West Germany 0 Argentina 0

Having both enjoyed victory in their opening group matches, it was a case of damage limitation at Villa Park as the pair settled for the point which kept them at the top of the table.

Both, of course, were ultimately beaten by England, Argentina at the quarter-final stage and West Germany in the final.

Sweden 1958: West Germany 3 Argentina 1

Holders West Germany opened their defence with a comfortable victory in Malmo. Despite falling behind in the third minute to an Omar Corbatta strike, the champions were ahead by half-time thanks to goals from Helmut Rahn and Uwe Seeler and the former added another after the break.

The match was remembered for Argentina wearing the shirts of host city IFK Malmo after forgetting to bring their change strip.
