A young Syrian woman believed to have been beheaded and skinned by security agents while in custody has stunned the country by appearing on Syrian state TV today.

International human rights groups and Syrian activists reported last month that 18-year-old Zainab al-Hosni was found mutilated after being detained.

Human rights activists said she was the first woman to die in Syrian custody since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad began in mid-March.

She quickly became a symbol of the Syrian uprising, with protesters in Homs hailing her as 
the 'flower of Syria.'

The apparent death confirmed what 
witnesses and the U.N. human rights office said was a fearsome new 
tactic of retaliating against protesters' families.

However Syrian TV today showed a black-clad young woman who identified herself as 18-year-old Zainab al-Hosni from Homs.

Boost: If the woman who appeared on Syrian state TV is confirmed as Zainab al-Hosni it will be a huge boost for President Bashar Assad and his government

The interview was designed to discount what the channel said were foreign 'media fabrications.'

The woman in the broadcast said she had run away from her family home in late July because her brothers allegedly abused her.

She claimed she wanted to speak out after hearing on TV that she had been arrested and beheaded.

She added that her family did not know that she was alive and asked her mother for forgiveness.

'I am very much alive and I have opted to tell the truth because I am planning to get married in the future and have kids who I want to be registered,' she said.

Hope: Syrians have been protesting against Bashar Assad's government since mid-March

Amnesty International said in a statement: 'We have seen the reports that have aired on Syria TV suggesting that Zainab al-Hosni is alive.

'We are currently looking into this case working with trusted sources in the country.'

Last month, Amnesty said the mutilated teenager had reportedly been detained by security agents to pressure her activist brother to turn himself in.

Al-Hosni's native central city of Homs is one of the hotbeds of the uprising.

She was reported to have been seized by men in plainclothes on July 27, apparently to pressure her brother Mohammed, who was organising protests in Homs, according to Amnesty.

The London-based group had also said al-Hosni's mother found her body in the morgue in September and, according to the family, she had been decapitated and her body badly mutilated.

Syrian authorities blame the unrest in the country on armed gangs and extremists and accuses some Arab TV channels of broadcasting false news to ignite protests and stir anti-government emotions.

State media allots much of its time and resources to discounting what it says are foreign media fabrications and lies.

There are no independent or pro-opposition media outlets in Syria.

The Syrian government has banned foreign journalists and placed heavy restrictions on local coverage, making it difficult to independently verify events on the ground.
