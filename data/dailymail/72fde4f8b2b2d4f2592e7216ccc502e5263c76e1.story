A 26-year-old man snatched an eight-year-old girl in the middle of the night as he stayed at her family's home - before murdering her and leaving her body in a shallow grave, police have said.

Justin James Rector was arrested on kidnapping and first-degree murder charges on Thursday morning after the body of Bella Grogan-Cannella was found in Bullhead City, Arizona on Wednesday.

At a press conference on Thursday, Police Chief Brian Williamson would not reveal how Bella died or if she had been sexually assaulted. He said they are still trying to determine a motive for the murder.

Rector, a family friend, had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before her death, he said.

Killed: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave near her family's home on Wednesday, police said

Her 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw Bella with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm on Monday, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said.

Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am on Tuesday.

Later that morning, Rector allegedly shoplifted clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said.

Cops arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance.

Bizarre: The evening after she was reported missing, Rector posted this message to Facebook

Suspect: Rector, who is also from Bullhead City, is friends with some of Bella's family members

When her body was found on Wednesday, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said at the press conference.

He was charged with kidnapping and murdering her on Thursday. Williamson said he has not ruled out the possibility of further charges or future arrests.

'My heart goes out to Bella, her family and this entire community,' Williamson said. 'We have completed the mission of bringing someone to justice for Bella's death.' 

Just hours after Bella was reported missing on Tuesday, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect.

'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote at 8pm Tuesday. 

'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' 

Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives.    

Heartbroken: Bella's mother Tania was seen screaming at the scene where the body was found

Grieving: Bella poses for pictures with her mother, Tania, who had reported her missing on Tuesday

Found: A map shows where Bella was last seen and where the body was found, half a mile away

On Thursday, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up.

Bella lived at the home with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area.  

Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs.   

On Wednesday night, Bella's mother, Tania, was seen sobbing and screaming 'No!' as relatives comforted her at the wash where the girl's body was found, ABC13 reported.  

Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was found on Wednesday as relatives held each other and wiped away tears.

'Everybody has come together,' her grandmother Sue said through tears. 'It's been wonderful, so we appreciate everything.'

Bullhead City, a city of about 40,000 people along the Colorado River some 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas.  

Scene: Her murdered body was found in this wash in Bullhead City, Arizona around noon on Wednesday

Mourning: Hundreds of people gathered at a park in Bullhead City for a candle-lit vigil on Wednesday
