Filipe Luis, a player so desperate to force his Chelsea move through that he was banished to train with the Atletico Madrid reserves, got his wish on Friday.

The 28-year-old became Chelsea's fourth signing of the summer - the second from Atletico - and is designed to replace the departed Ashley Cole.

Luis doesn't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer. He isn't even the most expensive left back, nor is he Chelsea's priciest purchase, yet there can be few as shrewd.

KEY STATS FROM LAST LA LIGA SEASON

26 - goals conceded in 32 games

131 - tackles made

49 - interceptions made

80.3 - per cent pass completion rate

1048 - passes completed out of 1305

Luke Shaw, Manchester United's new left back, cost almost twice as much as Luis.

That brought up questions: Is an 18-year-old worth £31.5m? Is Shaw ready for that responsibility? Will he bow to the pressure of high expectations?

Shaw, who turned 19 last week, has plenty to prove under Louis van Gaal. Luis, on the other hand, can be considered a safer bet by Jose Mourinho.

The Brazilian's stock has risen over time, and that comes as a result of proving himself in Europe.

Luis made 32 appearances in a defence that conceded just 26 goals last year to guide Atletico to their first La Liga title in 18 years.

He kept a pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent, made 131 tackles and intercepted 49 times.

Before all that, though, Luis joined Deportivo for a modest £1.7m. That time in Spain was what piqued Atletico's interest who, in 2010, paid £11.3m to bring him to the Vicente Calderon.

There have been downsides, though. He failed to win the Champions League last year, losing 4-1 in extra time to rivals Real, and was overlooked by Luiz Felipe Scolari for Brazil's World Cup squad.

Nevertheless, one of those remains a wrong Luis feels he can put right: 'I want to go one better in the Champions League and, in terms of the Premier League, I want the trophy badly.'

Luis has allowed the No 3 shirt - his regular at Atletico - to remain vacant, too. That is in tribute to his predecessor, Cole, who joined Roma after an eight-year stint at Chelsea.

Instead, Luis takes the No 5, last worn by Michael Essien, and was keen to express the move to England as a 'dream come true'.

‘I’m very happy and looking forward to getting started and giving my best for the team during the coming seasons,' he said.

'I'm going to give my best in all the games. You are never going to see Filipe walking on the field, always running.

'I will give my best and give a lot of work and effort. I hope we can bring trophies to the fans and they are going to be very happy with everybody.'

Only time will tell if it is as shrewd a bit of business as it looks by Mourinho when Chelsea's season gets going against Burnley on August 18.
