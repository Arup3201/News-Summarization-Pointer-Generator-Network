Police have uncovered a £1million 'Downton Abbey' mansion which had been transformed into a cannabis factory containing more than 1,000 plants.

Wendreda House in March, Cambridgeshire, was raided by officers yesterday after an anonymous tip-off about a pungent smell coming from the three-storey property.

They found three huge water tanks on the ground floor fed into seven growing rooms along with a maze of air filtration systems, electric leads and lights.

Intense humidity and an over-powering damp smell had generated a thick layer of mould in the house's nine bedrooms, six bathrooms, two utility rooms and four drawing rooms. 

Detective Inspector David Murphy, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'This place looks like something you would see in Downton Abbey or the place people take on for TV series Grand Designs.

'It's certainly not where you expect to see a highly professional cannabis factory. It is on a main road and surrounded by other homes. It was a risky project.'

He said they suspect the impressive home has been used for growing cannabis for the last six months.

Fashion magazines were piled on a coffee table in one of the ground floor living rooms where chandeliers hang over beautifully stripped and polished oak flooring.

'It was obviously once a much-loved and cared-for family home,'  Det Insp Murphy added. 'How it has got to be used like this we don't know.

'Usually cannabis factories are in remote areas or industrial units. This is something else - a really unusual find. 

The smart living room was equipped with two sofas, a table tennis table and a chandelier, while the kitchen was also in a good condition and still had food and drink left out on the side.

However, on the two floors upstairs there was a complex labyrinth of filtration systems and lights.  

The kitchen in the property looked virtually normal, and still had food and drink items left on the worktops

The windows were blacked out and there was no furniture in the  bedrooms to make way for the cannabis plants and equipment.

DI Murphy added: 'The downstairs rooms were in such a good condition that you could buy the house, do a bit of work to it and then be in within a month.'

They also found plants which appeared to be undergoing a nine-week growing period with baby plants being stored in the basement.

Det Insp Murphy revealed that the electrics had been bypassed, saving them from receiving a massive heating and lights bill.

He said: 'The lights are left on for around 18 hours a day to speed up the growing time.

When police arrived they found three large water tanks on the ground floor feeding into seven growing rooms

'You couldn't afford what a system like this would cost in terms of electrics.'

He said two men in their 20s were arrested at the grand house - valued at just over £1million by property website Zoopla - and taken into custody for questioning.

The mansion was named after St Wendreda, a Saxon princess who lived at March most of her adult life after setting up a Benedictine nunnery there.
