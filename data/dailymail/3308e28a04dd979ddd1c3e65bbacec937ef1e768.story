A murderer has been trying to seduce women from his prison cell using an online dating website.

Gavin Ward – who is serving a life sentence for hacking a young father to death with a samurai sword – is reported to have set up a profile in a bid to lure women.

The killer is said to have posted photographs of himself posing in jail on the Plenty of Fish site.

Looking for love: Convicted murderer Gavin Ward (above) posted photographs of himself posing in jail, where he is serving life with a minimum of 17 years for murdering his friend Christopher Mills in 2006

Profile: Ward's description said he liked the gym, nice food and wine bars and wants to 'meet new people'

His profile is reported to have read: ‘Im looking to meet new people and who knows maybe meet someone special.’

Last night, the Ministry of Justice said any prisoners caught using such websites would face losing privileges.

It is understood the profile has now been taken down.

Ward, 32, is serving his minimum 17-year term at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, for murdering his friend Christopher Mills, 22, in 2006.

Murder victim: Gavin Mills was killed with a sword

His victim’s mother, Gill, last night hit out at the prison and said Ward should not have been allowed to access the site.

She told The Mirror: ‘It is horrific. How could you allow someone who is supposed to be serving life to do this?

'He should get extra time added for this.’

Ward used a different name on his page and said he was interested in going to the gym and visiting wine bars.

A Prison Service spokesperson last night said: ‘We have made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf.

‘Prisoners should be in no doubt that if they break the rules or access these sites they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action.’

Last year two prisoners who boasted on Facebook of the easy life behind bars were warned they could have their sentences extended.

Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy, both 20, posed in their pants in a cell next to a PlayStation and a TV showing a music channel.

Between July 2009 and June 2011 342 inmates, including murderers, were caught using the social networking site while locked up..
