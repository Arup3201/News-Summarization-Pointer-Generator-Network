A 45-year-old father of two has described the moment he punched at a Great White Shark and let out a caveman-like scream in order to survive an attack from the ocean's deadliest creature.

College English teacher Jay Scrivner, of California, was out for an early morning surf at his regular spot in Humboldt Bay, Eureka - a known shark ground where a friend of his, Scott Stephens, almost died last year.

Scrivner had been in the water about two hours, with friends and other surfers around, when something just hit him.

So lucky: Unlike many, Jay Scrivner, a keen surfer and College teacher, encountered a Great White Shark and lived to tell the tale

Petrifying: Great whites are considered one of (if not the) deadliest creature in the ocean. They have been seen before in the spot Jay Scrivner was surfing near the Californian town of Eureka where he lives

Recovery: This photo - taken by Sunni Scrivner, Jay's wife, the day after the attack - shows Scrivner in Eureka's St Joseph Hospital after having 30 stitches in his thigh following a shark attack

'Sometimes you have a feeling that the water is weird,' Scrivner said on Monday from his hospital bed at Eureka's St Joseph Hospital.

'But everyone was just so happy. I was lying on my board, paddling around just waiting for a wave set.'

Moments later Scrivner realized every surfers worst fears - the sight of a shark's teeth and nose suddenly came 'out of nowhere'.

Not yet aware of what had happened, Scrivner took a swing at the great white, which he estimated was 8-to-9 feet long, and let what a friend who was nearby a 'primordial yell' (a primal scream).

'I couldn't believe it happened,' Scrivner said.

'When I turned away from the shark, I said, ''Did I really get bit?'' Your mind doesn't believe it.'

Scrivner said he did a quick inventory of his body parts and found everything was intact.

However he had been bitten on the thigh.

A friend encouraged him to keep paddling toward the beach.

Once there, friends and fellow surfers applied pressure on the wound and tied a T-shirt to stop the bleeding.

'What's strange about it was how amazing the morning was, how everyone was having a good time, and then the dichotomy,' Scrivner said.

Scrivner was alert and conscious on shore when rescue crews got to the scene around 8:45 a.m, Samoa Peninsula Fire District Chief Dale Unea said.

Scrivner said the bite wound on his left thigh did not sever an artery or damage any tendons.

There was some muscle tissue damage that required about 30 stitches, but he was expected to fully recover.

He said he thinks he was spared from more damage by his old surf board, which is thicker than many modern boards.

"If you're going to get bitten by a shark, I had the best scenario," he said.

Scrivner said he will 'definitely surf again'.

But ominously, he admitted to already having had a dream in which something was tugging on his surfboard leash.

'There's just a power in the ocean,' Scrivner said.

'When you see a shark or get bitten by a shark, you're just made critically aware of that power.'

It's not the first time a surfer has been made critically aware of a shark in the same spot.

Scott Stephens, a surfer pal of Scivner, was pulled underwater by a great white at Samoa Peninsula in November last year.

Doctors say Stephens suffered at least seven deep lacerations, but none of his vital organs was damaged.

'Mid-paddle, from behind me and out of the corner of my left eye 
something dark broke the surface and I felt a weight land on my back,' Stephens wrote in an editorial about the attack for Surf Transworld.

'My
first thought was it was a large seal, but as I was being drug 
underwater, feeling the force and power of being shaken in the jaws of a
top predator, I began fearing for my life. I felt so small and 
insignificant, but I opened my eyes underwater and came face to face 
with the first shark I’d seen in 13 years of surfing.'

'My right fist made contact with the shark just behind this eye. It felt 
like punching a bag of concrete. I can’t describe what I was feeling at 
this moment—some eerie combination of shock and terror. And then as 
quickly as the attack had started, it was all over. I was released, and 
the shark was gone into the depths.'
