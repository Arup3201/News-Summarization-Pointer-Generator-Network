Face, shoulders, hands, anything that might be glimpsed on stage turned a deep shade of green – it looks like a laborious process.

But Kerry Ellis, 35, who shot to fame playing the role of Elphaba in Wicked, says the transformation takes as little as 20 minutes to complete.

The actress, who recently returned to the show for a limited run, said: 'Everybody's been doing it for so long that it's quite quick now, they're like a machine.

'It is funny because some days because I'm so busy nowadays that I can be working on my computer when they are doing my make-up, so one minute I'm me and by the time I look up next I'm green, completely different, which is quite funny. I like that it's a complete transformation and completely different.

'We're quite lucky because I go a nice colour green, I'm not like the actual Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz, I haven't go the nose and the ears, it's quite complimentary make-up. Just a little bit different from what I wear on a night out though.'

Kerry says it can take as little as 20 minutes to make her transformation 

Having been performed more than 3,000 times in the West End alone and grossed £2.1billion internationally, Kerry said Wicked is the only role she would ever have considered returning to

Miss Ellis certainly knows how to keep the plates spinning: not only is she a new mum with a new baby, she has been performing in the West End and touring at the same time

Miss Ellis is now busy promoting her self-titled album, Kerry Ellis, released last month, and completing a nationwide tour that wraps up at the Cadogan Hall in London this weekend, the mother-of-one said it has been 'amazing' returning to a show that has been seen by 42 million worldwide.

Having been performed more than 3,000 times in the West End alone and grossed £2.1billion internationally, Miss Ellis said Wicked is the only role she would ever have considered returning to.

She stepped into the part for a twelve-week run, which also comes to an end this weekend, after the actress playing the role suffered an injury.

Despite having to juggle so much, Miss Ellis, 35, is happy her lifestyle provides her with the flexibility to be a hands-on mother to son Alfie who is yet to turn one.

She said: 'Alfie's more travelled and got more stamps in his passport than I did at his age. But, I am so grateful that I work in a business where he can be with me,' Kerry says. 'I get to have the best of both worlds – I get to continue doing my job, which I love, and I get to spend time with my son.

'The only difficult thing is taking him away from my husband, James, who misses him dreadfully. We make up for that when we come home. We find ways to make it work. We're very lucky that we have a great support system thanks to both of our families and that's working fine – touch wood – we just work on a little less sleep.'

Much of their lives are pre-planned – Kerry's diary is booked up months in advance, sometimes a year, and husband James Townsend is a football coach for Luton Town and so his life follows the football season. However, there are still times when they have to be places at the last minute.

'I don't know where we would be without both of our parents,' Kerry says. 'We can pick up the phone and say, can you pop over for a couple of hours or can you take Alfie for the weekend? They have been phenomenal because even though I can take Alfie with me and look after him during the day, he can't come with me on stage – not yet at least.'
