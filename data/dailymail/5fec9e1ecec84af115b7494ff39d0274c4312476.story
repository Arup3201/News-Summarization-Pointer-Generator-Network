A Catholic priest in Poland has warned parents that Lego is a 'tool of Satan' that could destroy their child's soul and 'lead them to the dark side'.

Father Slawomir Kostrzewa said a new range of figures by the Danish toy company 'were about darkness and the world of death' rather than the 'friendly fellows' the company traditionally produced.

The figures Father Kostrzewa referred to during his speech aimed at parents are from Lego's new 'Monster Fighters' and 'Zombie' series - both of which feature ghoulish, ashen-faced characters he claims have more in common with 666 - the number of the beast - than traditional plastic bricks.

'Evil': Father Slawomir Kostrzewa said Lego's new 'Monster Fighters' range is 'about darkness and the world of death' and could destroy the souls of children and 'lead them to the dark side'

Describing the Lego characters' change in appearence to wear torn clothes that are covered in blood, Father Kostrzewa said: 'Friendly fellows have been replaced by dark monsters... These toys can have a negative effect on children. They can destroy their souls and lead them to the dark side.'

'Facial expressions may be lead to confusion between good and evil,' he added.

Father Kostrzewa went on to cite research by New Zealand's University of Canterbury that Lego characters' faces have become angrier over the years, The Telegraph reported.

Saying the facial development proves the toys are becoming increasingly 'evil' Father Kostrzewa added: 'It appears the good suffer in battle and the 'villains' have a face showing satisfaction with their evil deeds.'

Lego's 'Monster Fighters' range features a sinister-looking character called Lord Vampyre who wants to 'cloak the world in darkness forever'.

Expressions: Father Kostrzewa is unhappy at the changing face of Lego characters. He describes the traditional character (left) as a 'happy fellow', while the modern designs are 'dark monsters'

To do this he plans to use a 'moonstone device' that is guarded by his 'manbat' henchmen inside a castle booby trapped with deadly spikes and trapdoors.

It is the job of the hero characters - sneering Dr. Rodney Rathbone and stern-faced Jack McHammer - to disable the device without being thrown into the castle's dungeon.

Father Kostrzewa's claims that Lego toys are the 'tools of Satan' have been been dismissed by at least one psychologist.

Speaking to the Super Express newspaper, Monika Filipowska said: 'These are just blocks. Linking them to Satan is just wrong, and all that will happen is that children will be afraid of them now.'

A spokesperson for Lego was not available for comment.
