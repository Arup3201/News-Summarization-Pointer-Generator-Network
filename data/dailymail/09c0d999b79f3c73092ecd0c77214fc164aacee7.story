He has won huge acclaim for his role in organising London 2012.

But it seems the success of the Olympics has earned Lord Coe something else, as well - the title of Britain’s most fanciable older man.

A survey of women looking for an older man found former middle distance runner Lord Coe, 55, was the chap they would most like to date.

He beat Sir Paul McCartney, 70, into second, with TV presenter Nick Knowles, 49, third, ahead of Alastair Campbell, 55.

The former Labour spin doctor beat Conservatives Boris Johnson, 48, and David Cameron, 45, who came fifth and seventh respectively.

Earlier this month DIY SOS star Knowles, who turns 50 this year, married his 25-year-old bride Jessica Rose Moor - who is almost half his age.

The poll questioned 3,000 females on dating website sugardaddie.com about men aged 45 or over whom younger women would like to date.

Also in the top ten are TV presenters Andrew Marr, 53, and Dermot Murnaghan, 54 - married men both recently seen with other women.

A female favourite: Alastair Campbell, 55, was in fourth place in the survey that questioned 3,000 women on dating website sugardaddie.com

Tory duo: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Mayor of London Boris Johnson (right), pictured together earlier this month, were also highly-rated

And, less surprisingly, billionaires 
Sir Richard Branson, 62, and Bernie Ecclestone, 81, both feature in the top 
ten compiled by the website.

Almost two-thirds of women visiting the website say they are not attracted to younger men - against the rise of the so-called 'cougar' trend of older women.

Helen Croydon, the author of Sugar Daddy Diaries, a memoir of her experiences exploring her penchant for the older man, explained the formula.

She said: ‘For a younger woman, the attraction is wisdom, confidence, sophistication, panache, emotional maturity, their ability to express themselves and even their style.

‘It isn’t money per se which attracts younger women. Money is often a symptom of success but it is success and prestige which is attractive.’
