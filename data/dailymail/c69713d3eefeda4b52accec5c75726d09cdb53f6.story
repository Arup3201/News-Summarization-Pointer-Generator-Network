A mother today joked that her wedding photographs might be used in evidence against her - after she defied a ruling to take her son out of school so that he could attend the ceremony.

Clare McLeary flouted the ruling by taking nine-year-old son Riley Bryant out of lessons so he could watch her tying the knot with fiance Andy McLeary, 37, on Lusty Gaze beach in Newquay, Cornwall.

Mrs McLeary, 30, who works as a police call handler, wrote to Clive Church of England School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, asking for permission to let Riley miss three days this week.

Sealed with a kiss: Clare and Andy McLeary pose for photos after their beach ceremony in Newquay, Cornwall. The couple said that they refuse to pay any penalty notices imposed on her by Clive Church of England School

Family moment: Mr and Mrs McLeary with nine-year-old Riley. Speaking on her decision to take her son out of school, Mrs McLeary said: 'This is one of the happiest days of my life and I wanted Riley here beside me'

But the school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’.

The couple, who have been together for three years, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley’s unauthorised absence from school.

Speaking as the couple posed for photos after their ceremony, Clare said: 'These pictures might get me sent to prison but, frankly, I don’t care.

'This is one of the happiest days of my life and I wanted Riley here beside me.'

Riley, who lives with his mother and step-father Mr McLeary added: 'I don’t like missing school but I wouldn’t miss seeing her get married for the world.

'I'm chuffed to bits to be part of my mum's big day. I enjoyed throwing the confetti on her and Andy.

Day to remember: The couple, pictured at their wedding, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their own wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley's unauthorised absence from school

In love: Mr and Mrs McLeary have been together for three years. The school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as 'exceptional circumstances'

'I was quite upset when my mum told me the school weren’t giving me permission to go to the wedding but all that’s the last thing from my mind. I just wanted to support my mum.'

Parents can put in requests for term-time
 holidays, but they are granted or refused entirely at the head 
teacher's discretion and are not a parental right.

Although fines can be imposed for unauthorised absence, it is at the discretion of the local authority.

Mrs McLeary insists that she will refuse to pay any penalty notices imposed on them by 
Clive Church of England School near Shrewsbury and is prepared to face 
prosecution.

Defiant: Clare McLeary, 30, who married Andy McLeary, 37, today (pictured together, left) took her son Riley Bryant (right) out of school for the wedding, even though his teachers refused him permission to miss lessons

Sanctions that can be imposed on the parents of truanting children include a three-month jail sentence or a fine of £2,500.

The row follows a crackdown on term-time absence which removed heads’ discretion to grant up to ten days’ holiday a year.

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove tightened the rules from last September to 
prevent unnecessary disruption to children’s education.

Denied: Police communications operator Mrs McLeary wrote to Clive Church of England School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire (pictured), asking for permission to let Riley miss three days of lessons this week

Venue: Mr and Mrs McLeary married on this beach in her hometown of Newquay, marking the spot by writing this loving message in the sand

He ordered heads
 to stop granting permission for term-time holidays unless families 
could show ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as a family bereavement.

Speaking before she tied the knot,
 Mrs McLeary, who had Riley in a previous relationship, said: ‘It’s 
absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my 
wedding.

‘If I had gone 
along with the school’s ruling then there would be no wedding because I 
can’t leave a nine-year-old home alone for three days.

'Andy and I both 
work full-time and this is the only time we could get off work.

Couple: Mrs and Mr McLeary, a police officer with West Mercia Police. Speaking before her wedding, she said: 'It's absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my wedding'

Risk: If parents fail to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty notices of £50 to £100. Parents who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council

‘Riley is an excellent pupil. The school isn’t even holding normal lessons this week anyway because it’s sports week.’

Schools
 and local councils can issue £120 spot fines if pupils are absent 
during term-time, although they are £60 if paid within 28 days. Parents 
who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council.

Mrs McLeary, who like her husband works for West Mercia Police, added: ‘I 
am fully prepared to go to court and I will refuse to pay any fine. If 
it means going to prison then so be it.’

Mary Lucas, headteacher at Clive school, said: ‘The school will only authorise leave in exceptional circumstances.

‘On
 June 16, 2014 we received an application for a pupil leave of absence 
from June 23 to 25. I would have been happy to talk to the parents about
 this request if they had come to see me.’

Shropshire Council said the head teacher of individual schools decided whether any case was exceptional.
