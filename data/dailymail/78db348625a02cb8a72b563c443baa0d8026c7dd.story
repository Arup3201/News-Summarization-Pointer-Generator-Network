David Luiz made his way back down memory lane on Wednesday as he went for a wander in west London with his Paris Saint-German team-mates ahead of facing former club Chelsea.

Laurent Blanc's squad are preparing to take on the Blues in a crucial Champions League last-16 second leg at Stamford Bridge later in the evening.

And Luiz, who left Chelsea in a £50million deal last summer, lead the squad on a walkbaout, with the French side looking for their first victory on English soil in the competition.

The fixture is finely poised after the 1-1 draw at Parc des Princes two weeks ago, with the hosts somewhat unlucky not to have beaten Jose Mourinho's men.

PSG trained at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night and will be looking for revenge after letting a 3-1 first-leg advantage slip at the same ground last season.

Blanc called for his side to take their chances in the cauldron at the Bridge.  

The PSG boss said: 'Chelsea have a slight advantage, because they were able to score an away goal. It's up to us to try to do what Chelsea did in Paris.

'One of Chelsea's main threats is the fact they're very good on the counter attack, so I don't think we should go gung ho.

'We have to attack and we need to score a goal, regardless of whether Chelsea get one or not.

The PSG players will wear black armbands at Stamford Bridge as a mark of respect for those killed in a helicopter crash in Argentina.

‘David Luiz is very excited to go back to Chelsea. He had great memories there, he helped them to win the Champions League - so I would be very surprised if the Chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception.

Among the 10 victims of the accident on Monday were renowned yachtswoman Florence Arthaud, Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and Blanc said 'the whole of French sport was in mourning'

Meanwhile, Brazilian centre back Thiago Silva has backed team-mate Luiz to take no notice of his former team-mates.

Silva said: 'He is a winner , yes he has good memories of Chelsea, but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress.’
