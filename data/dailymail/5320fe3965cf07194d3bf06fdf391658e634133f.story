As the England team crunched to defeat in their first World Cup match, another inauguration was taking place.

It was a very special moment in the annals of footballing history, one that we are not going to forget for a long time to come.

So blow the whistle – wheeeep! – and remember where you were the night Phil Neville made his debut as a commentator for the BBC.

‘It’s always difficult as an England supporter to enjoy these occasions,’ were his prophetic opening words as the game against Italy began. It was a warning of the horror to unfold over the next ninety minutes.

With his lips pressed close to the microphone, an intimate clinch of man and metal, Neville launched himself on an unsuspecting world without fear, filter or much forethought.

He wasted no time in mangling his clichés, and managed to keep coma-calm when the first two goals were scored. ‘That is what Wayne Rooney is for, to put in crosses like that’, he mused as the nation erupted in joy after Daniel Sturridge equalised for England.

He didn’t show a flicker of emotion – or even amusement – when the England physiotherapist was stretchered off when a celebratory group hug by team officials ended in injury. ‘Anything can happen if everybody jumps on top of each other,’ shrugged Neville.

Even during the most electrifying moments, Phil sounded like a depressed undertaker with a giant peg on his nose reading aloud a seed catalogue.

He spent much of the game mumbling incoherently or with his mouth too close to the mic, as if he was broadcasting in the silent hush of a snooker tournament, or perhaps hiding under the bed from his mum.

Briefly, he would talk knowledgeably about tactics, of how important it was, say, for England’s men to put pressure on the Italian midfield. Then he would ruin it, by savagely attacking the English language when he thought the ref wasn’t looking.

‘Yeah, he’s got to fire in them low crosses,’ he would say. Indeed, throughout his match commentary, Evil K-Neville would frequently use ‘them’ when he actually meant ‘those’ – a howling and irritating grammatical error.

At the very dawn of his career as a pundit, couldn’t a producer have had a quiet word in his ear and pointed out the mistake?  

This has nothing to do with his regional accent, but everything to do with basic good grammar. It is pretty inexcusable.

After all, Neville is no longer a footballer. He is – for the moment at least – a highly paid voice for the national broadcaster, a man whose every word is being beamed to 15million bemused viewers back home.

Meanwhile, back in the main studio, things were not much better. First, what has happened to Gary Lineker’s hair? The BBC’s top pundit now sports great, owlish wings of white furze flowing over the sides of his head, making him look like Grandpa Munster. The humidity in Brazil has much more to answer for than players failing to find their pace.

In Lineker’s studio, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand were joined by Thierry Henry. I couldn’t catch much of what the latter said, but at least he had the excuse of speaking in a second language. The other two have no such defence, but do they care?

‘He always wanted to play in the middle. Not on the left or the right-hand side,’ said Shearer, carefully explaining for confused viewers exactly where they could find the middle.

Ferdinand either talks rubbish or spouts footy clichés. ‘Danny Welbeck opened his legs down the side,’ he said at one point – a horrifying image.

Rio also wasted no time in explaining yet again how it feels like a completely unique cauldron of seafood when you are actually playing in a match.

‘It’s a totally different kettle of fish once you get on that pitch,’ he said. Thank you, Rio! Makes you think that Phil Neville isn’t so bad after all, though.  

Cheer up, everybody. There is only five weeks of this to go.
