John McAfee today accused the Belize government of arranging to have a fire started at his property, destroying two main residences and causing $500,000 damage.

Two buildings at the software tycoon's $5million island compound in the Central American country were gutted by fire on May 16.

Speaking from his home in Portland, Oregon, McAfee told MailOnline today that he believed the Belize government had paid a low-level individual to commit arson.

Nothing left: Two of the structures at the $5million compound were entirely ruined

Scorched: No one was in the properties at the time when the fires took hold

McAfee said that he has a private investigator working on the case who could prove that Landy Burns, the political representative for the town of Orange Walk East, was behind the fire. 

McAfee said that a woman has been charged with reckless endangerment over the fire but no corroborating reports were found. Orange Walk police department had not responded to an email from MailOnline.

No one was in the buildings at the time of the fire. McAfee believes that the fire is part of a campaign against him by the Belize government which began in 2012 when he was asked for a $2million donation which he refused to hand over.

He said he was offered land deals as part of the package but refused. A short time later, the tycoon said 42 armed soldiers appeared on his property, shot his dog and left him handcuffed in the sun for 12 hours.

The fire is the latest twist in John 
McAfee's roller-coaster life that saw the 67-year-old tech pioneer flee Belize in November after he was named a 'person of interest' in the death of his American neighbor Gregory Viant Faull.

McAfee has never been named as a suspect in the murder case which is yet to be solved.

Ruins: The $500,000 property was reduced to rubble following the blaze

7newsbelize.com revealed that the buildings in Carmelita were gutted by a bush fire which started around 1pm on May 16.

It is the latest chapter in the surreal life of McAfee. Last November, he went on the run after Belize police wanted to question him as a 'person of interest' in the fatal shooting of Mr Faull.

Faull, 52, was shot dead last November on the Caribbean island where both men lived.

McAfee had been living in the Central American nation but fled after police 
sought to question him about his fellow ex-pat and neighbor's death.

Fleeing from authorities, 
McAfee went into hiding, but continued blogging about his unfolding 
adventure, detailing how he had faked a heart attack and used disguises 
to elude his pursuers.

Shortly
after crossing into Guatemala with the help of a decoy, McAfee was detained and deported to Miami.

The tech tycoon is now living in Portland, Oregon as part of an 18-month stint to work on a movie and graphic novel about his life.

He told MailOnline that he plans to remain in the U.S. from now on, adding that he was too old to start again in another foreign country.
