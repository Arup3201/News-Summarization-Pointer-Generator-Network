It may previously have been mainly associated with being a staple of smoky strip clubs, but pole dancing has undergone something of a transformation in recent years.

For huge numbers of people across the world, the demanding craft is now more likely to be seen as a workout activity, including many of those who attended the 3rd Annual Pole Expo in Las Vegas.

The expo, held at the Palms Casino, offered workshops on everything from strength conditioning to lap dancing.

Fawnia Dietrich, who got her start as a stripper but has since launched a Las Vegas studio offering fitness-focused pole classes, said: 'Most people that pole dance in the studios are everyday women, not strippers.

'It has that connotation of sensuality or eroticism that makes it a little more fun.'

Vendors at the event sold sparking two-piece pole dancing outfits as well as the poles themselves and heels.

Some of the best dancers however decide against wearing the stilettos and opt instead to go barefoot so they can better point their toes and stick to the pole.

Showing off the splits and gravity defying handstands off the side of the pole, their athletic performances are more akin to an Olympic gymnast on the uneven bars than a burlesque show. 

Dietrich said her students have many different reasons for choosing pole dancing. Some want to build upper body strength and lose weight while others may want to surprise their husband with an anniversary dance.

'They need to find their sensuality again,' she said.

While pole dancing has become more sophisticated and widespread, its evolved versions are rarely seen in its birthplace. 

Expo attendee May Chen said strip club patrons are still far less interested in watching a dancer execute an acrobatic move on a pole than watch her shake and shimmy.

'Customers don't care to see Cirque du Soleil,' she said.
