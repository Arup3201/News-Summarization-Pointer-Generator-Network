These pictures show a man obsessed by Doomsday rumours slashing a Chinese schoolgirl with a machete outside her school gates.

Min Yongjun, 36, has been arrested on suspicion of jeopardising public security for stabbing a total of 23 children last Friday

A statement from the Guangshan county government indicated that Min might have been strongly affected by 'Doomsday rumours', that predict an apocalypse this Friday.

Ancient Mayans claimed that on December 21 2012, a
5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count supposedly comes to a close.

Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, starts counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21.

They
say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle
would be a milestone â€” but they have been keen to stress that it does 
not mark an end.

Conspiracy 
theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending 
astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from 
explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power 
grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's 
magnetic field.

Min Yongjun, who is reported to suffer from epilepsy, first burst into the home of an elderly woman an slashed her with the machete before rushing to the school where he continued the frenzied attack.

'Initial police investigation found Min, a
long-term epilepsy sufferer, had been strongly psychologically affected
by rumours of the upcoming end of the world predicted by ancient 
prophecy,' Xinhua said.

Chinese police have already detained more 
than 500 people from a fringe Christian group for spreading rumours about
the world's impending end, according to state media reports.

The detentions come ahead of Friday, 
December 21 - a date some say the Mayans prophesised would be the end of
the world and which was the subject of the apocalyptic movie '2012.'.

Police
seized leaflets, video discs, books and other apocalyptic materials as 
they arrested more than 500 people across eight provinces and regions, 
from the prosperous east coast to less developed western China, state 
media reports said.

Those
detained are reported to be members of the group Almighty God, which is
also called Eastern Lightning, after a phrase from the Bible's Book of 
Matthew.

Widely 
regarded as a heretical Christian sect, the group preaches that Jesus 
has reappeared as a woman in central China. It has been accused of 
targeting Christians, kidnapping and beating them to force conversions.
