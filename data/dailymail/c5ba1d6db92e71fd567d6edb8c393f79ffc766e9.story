There is much upset at Wimbledon about rights-holders BBC paying Andy Murray for a regular online column.

The tax-payer-funded Beeb are understood to be giving multi-millionaire Murray £400 a time for his digital contribution, despite having exclusive TV access to him with an interview straight after every match.

Murray’s over-the-top BBC commitments, added to his recovery routine, make his after-match duties unnecessarily complicated.

Causing a stir: The BBC are paying Andy Murray £400 a day to contribute to an online Wimbledon column

Don't mention the hairdryer! An Alex Ferguson line of questioning has seen Garry Richardson fall out of favour

BBC children’s glove puppet Hacker The Dog has had more of Murray’s time than many journalists.

A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘We do pay Andy for his BBC Sport column which gives exclusive insight into his thoughts during Wimbledon —something which we’re sure is of great interest to readers of the website. Payment for columns or blogs is standard practice.’

Meanwhile, it is noticeable that BBC veteran Garry Richardson is not doing as many post-match Murray interviews.

The Scot was infuriated by Richardson asking whether he would be receiving a Sir Alex Ferguson-style hair-dryer from coach Ivan Lendl after coming back from two sets down to beat Fernando Verdasco last year, in a match watched by the former Manchester United manager.

Richardson later apologised for his dire questioning.

Murray’s camp say they have made no requests about who does the interview, but Richardson has only been in the role once. A BBC spokeswoman said the choice of interviewer depended on who was available at the time.

Ivan Lendl’s tennis earnings might have dipped since he stopped coaching Andy Murray but not by as much as the £15million asking price for his Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion with equestrian facilities, indoor basketball court and multi-storey guest rooms. Lendl spends most of his time at his other home in Florida playing golf.

All England Club members are baffled about dictatorial chairman Philip Brook  insisting that players adhere to the strict white-only clothing policy during the tournament when members are allowed a lot more freedom over kit colours. Wimbledon counter that club matches are not televised.

The online secondary ticket market presented a major problem to Wimbledon last year, with seats being traded and both purchasers and vendors oblivious to regulations that only allow the official  re-selling of debentures. But a crackdown by Wimbledon has seen the issue kept under control with no sign of Championship tickets being re-sold by the usual suspects.

Grigor Dimitrov, Wednesday’s quarter-final opponent for Andy Murray, faces conflict-of-interest issues after joining the agency that Roger Federer set up to look after himself.

Contrast of interests? Grigor Dimitrov has joined Roger Federer's management Team8

Federer left IMG along with his agent Tony Godsick to run their own athlete management operation Team8, which now represents Dimitrov. But it will cause complications, for instance, if Federer plays Dimitrov for a place in the top-eight ATP Tour Finals when one of them has already qualified.

Godsick has said Federer will play no part in the business until the end of his tennis career.

Sleeping with the enemy? Judy Murray is working with the LTA to encourage young girls to play tennis

Judy Murray, a fierce opponent of the Lawn Tennis Association for many years, is slowly being drawn into the Roehampton tent.

As well as being Federation Cup captain, Judy is working with the LTA on an initiative called Miss-Hits, encouraging young girls into the sport.

Murray designed the ‘cool’ programme to give five to eight-year-olds a positive first experience of the sport.

Child obesity is a serious problem, so beaten quarter-finalist Maria Sharapova, when asked about understandable criticism of her pop-up Wimbledon sweet shop, should not have given such a crass reply.

‘Criticism but great sales afterwards,’ she said. ‘It’s the best day after the criticisms. If you want to provide some more…’
