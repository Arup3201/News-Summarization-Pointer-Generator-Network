New Jersey Police discovered a man was smuggling 100 bags of heroin in his anus following a routine traffic stop yesterday.

Rasoul Speight, 32, and Gary Sylak, 26, both of New York State, were taken for additional searches when officers discovered that both men had outstanding traffic violations.

At the station, police found that Speight, who is also listed as a member of the Bloods street gang, was storing a large amount of narcotics in his anal cavity.

Gary Sylak was a passenger in the car and police discovered a syringe and spoon, covered in heroin residue, in the liner of his jacket

Officers believe the men were heading to upstate New York, where the 100 bags would have been worth $2,000.

This heroin haul is described by The Smoking Gun as a new record for this specific method of concealment.

Bola Adebisi, a 52-year-old Nigerian woman, set the world record for amount of ingested heroin ever recovered when she was busted with five pounds of the drug in 180 pellets at Dulles Airport in March 2012. But the heroin found with Adebisi was stored in her stomach.

Speight was driving north on the Palisades Interstate Parkway when police pulled the 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer over for having unclear license plates and an obstructed view.

When officers approached the car they smelt burnt marijuana and after receiving permission to search the vehicle found 'nothing of evidentiary value.'

But the outstanding traffic warrants for both men made police conduct an additional body search at headquarters, where the drugs were found.

Police said they also discovered a syringe and spoon, covered in heroin residue, in the liner of Sylak's jacket.

Both Speight, of Port Jervis, NY, and Sylak, from Shandaken, NY, wereÂ charged with possession of heroin with intent to sell, possession of heroin and tampering with evidence.

Sylak was also charged with possessing drug paraphernalia.

Both men were transported to the Bergen County Jail, where they remained on Friday awaiting arraignment.
