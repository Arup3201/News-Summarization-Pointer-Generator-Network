The daring mission to retrieve a top-secret CIA satellite from the bottom of the ocean at the height of the Cold War was kept under wraps for 40 years - until the spy agency decided to lift the lid.

Last week, the mission was declassified, and the report and photos of the effort to recover the Hexagon satellite were made available for public consumption.

The satellite was one of three that was sent into orbit to provide a bird’s eye view of the Soviet Union and China and other potential foes during the Cold War.

But as the Hexagon re-entered earth’s atmosphere, a parachute designed to soften its landing broke, and the craft plummeted into the Pacific Ocean.

For months, the satellite - and its 60 miles of film - were lost on the sea floor.

Space.com reported that two missions to retrieve the satellite in 1971 failed, but the Navy tried again on April 25, 1972.

In the third mission, the Navy used its Trieste II Deep Sea Vehicle – complete with a mechanical arm – to bring the Hexagon to the surface.

There was, however, one setback.

The report said: 'The third attempt was successful in locating and securing the film stacks; however, as the Trieste was surfacing, the film broke into pieces. Twenty-five feet was recovered.'

What the Navy took away from the recovery mission was the proper actions to carry out such salvage missions in the future.

The highly classified Hexagon satellite, also known as the Big Bird, was not seen publicly until September of last year.

That was when a KH-9 Hexagon was displayed to the public in a one-day-only exhibit at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport, Virginia.

The Big Bird satellite is 60-feet long and weighs 30,000 pounds, bigger than a bus. It took extremely detailed photographs from space during the Cold War.

Those who developed it worked long hours
under tight deadlines, missing family holidays and anniversaries, and 
could tell no one - not even their wives and children - what they were 
up to.

Big Bird was first placed in orbit in 1971 and was one of the most advanced spy satellites of its time, producing images of the Soviet Union, China and other countries that held strategic importance for the U.S. government.

The film was shot back through the earth's atmosphere in buckets that parachuted over the Pacific Ocean, where C-130 Air Force planes snagged them with grappling hooks.
