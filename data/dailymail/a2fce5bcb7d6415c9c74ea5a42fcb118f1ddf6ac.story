Nurses at a Cleveland hospital have surprised a lung transplant patient and his fiancee by organizing them a wedding - a month after the couple was forced to cancel their nuptials when a donor became available.

Doug Smith, a police officer with life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis, was just a week from marrying girlfriend Susan when they got the call that the hospital had a lung for him.

They canceled the church wedding and left their Zanesville, Ohio home for the Cleveland Clinic's Transplant Center, where 42-year-old Smith underwent the life-saving surgery just days later.

But exactly a month after he was given his new lung, hospital staff gave him another gift: A surprise wedding on the rooftop in front of relatives and staff members.

Special day: Hospital staff provided Doug and Susan Smith with a veil, flowers, food and a cake so that they could get married. A month earlier, they had called off their wedding so he could undergo a transplant

Susan had cleared the on-site wedding with the hospital chaplain as the marriage license was about to expire - but they had no idea about the rest of the plans, or the lengths the nurses had gone to.

'The next thing you know there was a 
roomful of nurses with pen and paper, running in and out of the room, 
deciding among themselves that they would take care of everything,' she told ABC News.

'It was amazing - they were so excited. It 
was very emotional.'

Nurses gave the couple a bouquet of 
daisies, one even gave them her own veil to use and another, who was a consultant for the cosmetics company Mary Kay, 
brought in a case of make-up.

They provided food that had been donated by Starbucks and Au Bon Pain and bought a cake.

Staff also created a sign for the back of Smith's wheelchair reading: 'He got his lungs, she got his heart.'

Susan added that she wore a white dress she already had, which she wore with flip flops after her daughter forgot to bring her shoes.

Smith, who has never smoked, first knew something was wrong in 2011 when he started suffer asthma-like symptoms that left him tired and struggling to breathe.

He was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, which scars the tissues on the lungs, and placed on the lung transplant list on June 18.

As his condition was so severe, he was placed in the top 10 per cent of patients and got a call just three days later.

People suffering from pulmonary fibrosis often live between two to five years after they are diagnosed, but medical staff told ABC the transplant means he could live for 20 more years.

Dr. Marie Budev, medical director of Cleveland Clinic's Lung Transplantation Program, said that his operation had not been easy and he still had a lot of recovering to do, but that she was hopeful he would recover well due to his age.

'If they are younger and their other 
organs are younger, they are able to sustain a lot of the toxic effects 
from the immune suppressive drugs they are on for the rest of their 
life,' she told ABC.

She added that the wedding had lifted everyone's spirits.

'We had never had a wedding after a 
transplant like this - it was special for us,' she said. 'Despite the 
terrible things that happen, life goes on.'

The couple, who have been together for five years, have three teenage children between them.

His wife has returned to work at Home Depot and her new husband is hopeful he will also go back to work one day. They are also planning a benefit to help pay for medical bills.
