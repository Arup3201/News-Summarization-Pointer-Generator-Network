Tragedy: Pensioner Eleftheria Demetriou was stabbed by Hakim Abdillahi who believed that she was the anti-Christ

A delusional killer who entered the country on a false passport was today sentenced to remain indefinitely in hospital for butchering a pensioner who he believed was the anti-Christ.

Hakim Abdillahi, 38, repeatedly stabbed  Eleftheria Demetriou, 79, with such ferocity last August the blade snapped off.

Abdillahi, who came to Britain from African country Djibouti in 1999 pretending to be six years younger, launched the frenzied attack a month after being discharged from hospital where he was treated for a personality disorder.

But on August 15 Abdillahi - who was bullied in his homeland for being effiminate - killed the widow after stopping taking his medication and turning instead to cannabis and khat.

Today, Abdillahi, from Wood Green, north London admitted manslaughter at the Old Bailey.

Kaly Kaul QC, prosecuting, said the killer was friends with his victim whom he used to call 'grandma'.

In the days before attacking the pensioner Abdillahi was behaving erratically and making alarming claims about doing God’s work and hunting the anti-Christ.

After killing the mother-of-one he rang 999 but the ambulance service believed they had been called out to a cardiac arrest.

When they arrived at the victim’s home, which was on the same estate as Abdillahi’s, paramedics found her body with multiple stab wounds and a cushion over her face.

Miss Kaul said the killer, normally thought to be 'gentle and quiet', remained at the scene and was compliant.

Abdillahi, who was convicted of battery in February 2011, told police at the scene 'You should be happy the anti-Christ is dead', the barrister said.

On August 2, 13 days before the killing, he phoned police and told them he was being “picked on” and would kill himself if he did not get help.

Nine days later he told officers 'the holy spirit was in him' and he had been taken by demons but knew where the anti-Christ lived, which was Mrs Demetriou’s address, the court heard.

On August 13 neighbours said he was shouting up at the victim outside her house and he also prayed with her.

The day after he called police, Miss Kaul said, telling them 'he had just killed demons'.

Twenty-four hours later, he killed Mrs Demetriou.

Miss Kaul said he told paramedics and police 'I have killed the anti-Christ', 'God told me to do it - it is God’s will', and 'I was told to deal with her - you should be happy the anti-Christ is dead'.

The barrister said that in Abdillahi’s police interview he told them that before he killed her, Mrs Demetriou knocked twice on his front door but he refused to answer it because he believed she was possessed.

After she left, he took a knife, crystals and a DVD podcast to her home.

'He told her he knew who she was and plunged a knife into her body as many times as God told him to,' Miss Kaul said

A post-mortem examination showed the pensioner died from multiple wounds to the heart and spleen.

In a victim impact statement, the pensioner’s only child Marios Demetriou said he was heartbroken by his mother’s death and that his whole family was in counselling.

Mr Demetriou, who sat in court and broke down as details were aired, added that his seven-year-old daughter was so afflicted by her grandmother’s death she could not go to school and had nightmares that Abdillahi would kill her.

Ross Johnson, the killer’s barrister, said Abdillahi had a history of self-harming and depression.

He came to Britain in 1999 with a passport that claimed he was born in 1980 - he was actually born in 1974.

Abdillahi was admitted to St Ann¿s Hospital in Haringey, north London, and discharged in July between three and four weeks before committing the crime

He settled in Cardiff after winning indefinite leave to remain but moved to London in 2004 when he was treated for depression.

In 2007 he was admitted to hospital after hearing voices, suffering panic attacks and being unable to sleep.

He was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.

His barrister said that between 2007 and 2012 he progressed well with care in the community, although once “lashed out” at someone in a group hospital session.

But in 2012 he was admitted to St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey, north London, and discharged in July between three and four weeks before committing the crime.

Mr Johnson said he had a 'catastrophic collapse in his mental health' and was 'acutely psychotic on the day of the killing'.

Abdillahi is currently being treated in hospital and is responding to anti-psychotic medication, he said.'But he currently has no insight into what he has done,' his barrister said.

The judge, Richard Hone QC, made an order admitting the killer into a secure hospital with no time limit.

'What you did almost defies rational explanation,' he said.
