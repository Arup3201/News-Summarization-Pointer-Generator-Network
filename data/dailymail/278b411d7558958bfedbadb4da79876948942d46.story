Arrowhead Stadium is once again the loudest outdoor venue in sports.

After claiming the record last season, and then losing it to the Seattle Seahawks, the fans of the Kansas City Chiefs reclaimed the mark with a reading of 142.2 decibels in the first half of their game against the New England Patriots on Monday night.

Guinness World Records was on hand to record the noise level. The record had been 137.6.

To put that in perspective, a jet engine at 100 feet is about 140 decibels, which means the sustained noise in the stadium was enough to jeopardise the hearing of the fans.

Among them were several members of the Kansas City Royals, who will play the Oakland A's in an AL wild-card game  at Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday night.
