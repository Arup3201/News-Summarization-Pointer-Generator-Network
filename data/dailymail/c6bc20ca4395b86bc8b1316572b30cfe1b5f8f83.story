It's one thing having a laugh at other people's expense, but when the joke involves ebola and Australian commuters, don't expect to have them rolling in the aisles.

That's what YouTube 'prankster' Adrian Van Oyen found out after projectile vomiting green liquid on a Queensland Rail train and later claiming he had the disease that has so far killed thousands in Africa as well as aid workers from around the world. 

The footage shows the 20-year-old comedian standing in front of a carriage of commuters on a Queensland Rail train and casually vomiting green liquid – it was milk he had stained with food colouring.

Prankster Adrian Van Oyen thought it would be funny to vomit on train in front of disgusted commuters

But it wasn’t all fun and games for Van Oyen, from Beenleigh, south of Brisbane, who was taken to court over the stunt where he was banned from Queensland Rail for life and had to pay a cleaning fee. 

'I also got charged for public nuisance,’ Van Oyen told Daily Mail Australia. A caption along the video said: 'I tried telling them I had ebola. But nope, still got a life time ban from Queensland Rail. I guess I'll be getting the bus from now on for my hospital appointments lol.'

The footage has received a significant amount of mixed responses from the public, with some offended by the ebola remark, while others are defending the prankster.  

After drinking three litres of milk and green food colouring, the 20-year-old started throwing up

In the YouTube clip commuters are heard laughing and yelling 'gross' 'that's disgusting', 'ewwwwww' and 'put that s*** on Facebook' while one woman is seen getting up and moving away from the repulsive scene. 

‘I drank three litres of milk filled with some green colouring – that’s why it was green and why I projected so much,' Van Oyen told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It was actually quite painful drinking so much but I wanted to create a really epic scene.

'After we filmed it, I was quite hungry so my camera guy and I went to KFC.'  

Donning a pair of grey-washed jeans and a  t-shirt, Van Oyen, is seen taking in deep breathes in the video before he continues his cheeky stunt.

‘You always see stupid little videos of people puking on trains, from being drunk and stuff – so I thought, psh, I can do that. So I did,’ he said.

‘Only I tried to make it a little more extraordinary, which I like to think I did.’

The prankster was recently taken to court and is now 'banned from Queensland Rail for life'

The video was uploaded to Van Oyen's Facebook page on Monday night and has already been viewed more than 400,000 times. 

It comes after the comedian filmed himself pretending to trip over and spill the items from the shelves at some of Australia's leading retailers.

'I released a video last week, which got me banned from all Coles, Woolworths, Big W and BI-LO for a whole year after the video went viral,' he said.

‘I was  taken to court by Coles and then Woolies came along and took me to court after it created a lot of controversy.'

Despite the ban from giant retailers and Queensland Rail, Van Oyen added: ‘No regrets filming it – it was worth it!’

Van Oyen is an Australian comedian prankster and is known for his YouTube channel, along with his one million subscribers.
