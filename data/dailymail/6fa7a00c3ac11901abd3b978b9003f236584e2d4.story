Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admits he has been saddened by calls from the club's fans for his head.

The 52-year-old was booed whenever he entered his technical area during Saturday 3-0 Barclays Premier League victory over Cardiff at St James' Park, which ended a run of six successive defeats.

However, he is refusing to allow the pressure to get to him as he prepares for Sunday's final day trip to Liverpool.

Pardew told the Shields Gazette: 'Obviously, I'm a little bit sad about the situation, but my resolve has to be strong to make sure the players are ready for Liverpool.

'We need to go to Anfield and put in a top performance.'

Pardew, who signed an eight-year contract in September 2012, is not understood to be in any immediate danger, although he will have to negotiate his end-of-season debrief with owner Mike Ashley, something he managed by the skin of his teeth 12 months ago after a desperate fight against relegation.

This time around, the Magpies will finish no lower than 10th, a significant improvement on the last campaign, although one which might have been markedly better but for the decision to sell star midfielder Yohan Cabaye in January and not replace him.

Should Pardew receive the green light from Ashley, he will hope to embark upon a major rebuilding exercise this summer with strikers Loic Remy and Luuk de Jong only on loan and Shola Ameobi out of contract, while a replacement for Cabaye will be a priority too.

Pardew said: 'We need to make sure that we start next season in the same position we started this season. We had a strong team and were challenging for Europe.

'But towards the back end of the season, we have not been that good. We need to accept that, accept the criticism and make the right calls.'
