This clip captures the incredible moment a car smashes into the central reservation on the A14 and drives on with parts hanging off.

It starts with the white vehicle swerving across lanes and spin around in a circle after crashing into the central reservation.

The car then hurtles into the hard shoulder, but almost immediately, the driver carries on weaving dangerously in and out of traffic. 

The incident, recorded on dash-cam footage, shows the car swerve haphazardly into the right lane on the A14

The vehicle then veers close to the central reservation and after skimming along the edge, it crashes

A fellow motorist captured the incident on dash-cam footage in Kettering, Northamptonshire, on November 19. 

In the clip, he muses the driver 'must be on drugs' as he continues driving along haphazardly - despite parts of his car hanging off. 

The man, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was returning home from work and from nowhere I was blindsided by the car travelling a very high speed. 

'I slowed down as I thought he was going to hit the vehicle in front, how he missed it I don't know.

'Once he recovered from the crash and ended up on the verge, I couldn't believe it when he got back onto the road to continue driving.

'At first, I thought he was driving up to the parking lay-by up the road but it soon became clear he wasn't sticking around and got up to very high speeds considering his car was so badly damaged.

He added: 'I kept my distance but wanted to carry on filming, although when he finally swerved of the road between the two lorries, I feared I got a little too close and could have ended up getting caught up in an accident myself.

'Upon speaking to the police it seems he got back on to the road and managed to evade them, leaving the car in a village some five miles up the road.' 

After crashing, the car spins around in a circle and then hurtles towards the hard shoulder

A fellow motorist expressed his shock at the driver's antics in Kettering, Northamptonshire

At one point in the video, the car weaves into a neighbouring lane and almost causes another crash with a lorry, which can be heard beeping it horn after almost being hit. 

The white car then drives along the hard shoulder and comes to a stop. 

After following the white vehicle driving dangerously for several minutes after the crash, the witnesses who recorded the clip decide to report the incident to police. 

Others said afterwards the driver was intoxicated and at one point, got out of his car and threatened someone and later abandoned the car in a local village.

Police said the man was arrested on suspicion of drink driving.
