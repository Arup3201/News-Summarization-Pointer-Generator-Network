An adorable Rottweiler has had his first McDonald's drive-through experience captured on video.

Cultus was treated to a cheeseburger by his owner, Kym Ozols, at the fast food chain and nothing could wipe the excitement off his face in anticipation of the meal.

In the video, Mr Ozols, 31, is seen pulling his car up next to the drive-through window of Noarlunga McDonald's - south of Adelaide.

Cultus is owned by Adelaide man Kym Ozols who has raised the eight-year-old Rottweiler

The eight-year-old dog sticks his head out of the open window with his tongue hanging out, ready to receive his reward.

The McDonald's worker who comes to the window with the cheeseburger is startled by her customer, but she hands over the food after Mr Ozols reassures her no harm will come to her.

Cultus wastes no time and digs into the cheeseburger on the backseat of the car.

Mr Ozols told Daily Mail Australia they had taken his dog out for 'a big day out' before they made the stop.

Cultus is so well-loved that Mr Ozols and his brothers have started up a Facebook page for him

'It was a bit hard to get him in the washing bay [to get cleaned] so we decided to give a treat afterwards,' Mr Ozols said.

'He's always eaten our junk food when we're at home so we thought we would get him something fresh.'

Mr Ozols said his dog may be big but he was definitely not intimidating. 

At first, the McDonald's worker is reluctant to hand over the burger but she does after she is reassured no harm will come to her

'He just wants a pat and he wants food. He's more of a human than a dog, he has got a good character,' he said.

The Adelaide man said he had grown up eating cheeseburgers and so had his dog.
