First daughter Malia Obama received a brand new car for her sweet 16 birthday on Friday, according to sources close to the first family, but unfortunately for her she won't be able to drive it alone for at least another year.

Drivers in the District received fair warning in February that Malia may soon be behind the wheel of a car - from her mother no less.

'Ladies and gentlemen in DC, watch out!' first lady Michelle Obama joked at the time. 'Malia Obama on the road - kinda frightening.'

Details of 
the make, model and color weren't immediately available, or even how she
 spent the day, which happens to coincide with the date the US 
celebrates its independence.

President
 Barack Obama has striven to keep his family out of the spotlight, and 
staffers have remained mum about any planned festivities.

We do know that rapper Pitbull performed on the South Lawn of the executive mansion, though it wasn't clear if that was for Malia or just part of the White House's 4th of July celebrations.

And the president, in remarks to celebrate the holiday, made a few comments about the birthday girl.

'And, of course, this is always a special day for us because this is Malia’s birthday,' he said. 'She’s getting her license, but she has to practice a little bit before that happens.'

In any 
case, Malia may now have her own wheels but driving on her own is out of
 the question - let alone without her Secret Service escort.

Washington 
requires teens to be at least 17 to drive a car without an adult 
present, and that's only after holding a provisional license for six 
months, according to the Daily Caller.

At
 16, she can acquire a learner's permit, but an adult must be in the 
front seat at all times, and she can only be on the road from 6am to 9pm Sunday 
through Thursday and 6am to 11:50pm on Fridays and Saturdays.
