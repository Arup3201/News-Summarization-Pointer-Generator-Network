A fixated woman has been warned that she will be jailed if she continues to bombard a married vicar with cards, letters and gifts.

Maureen Peace, 50, was given a 12 month community order and an indefinite restraining order last August, banning her from contacting the Rev Keith Rengert after she stalked him for two years.

But Norwich Crown Court heard how she broke the restraining order within days by writing to Mr Rengert, 45, who is rector of Spixworth, Norfolk.

She was due to be sentenced for the offence in October, but sentencing was adjourned for three months to see if she kept away from him.

The court heard on Friday that her behaviour had been 'positive' since her earlier breach and she had made no further contact with the vicar.

Judge Mark Lucraft gave her a new 12-month community and supervision order with a mental health requirement, with the restraining order left in place.

But he warned her that she would go to jail if she breached the order again. The offence has a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.

Ms Peace, who is from North Walsham, Norfolk, admitted a charge of harassment without violence between July 1 2010 and June 2 last year at an earlier hearing before Norwich magistrates.

The court heard how Ms Peace became 'fixated' with the vicar and sent him messages saying that she loved him after he conducted her mother's funeral.

But her persistent approaches were not appreciated by Mr Rengert when he was in his earlier post as curate at 14th century St Nicholas church in North Walsham.

He asked her to stop contacting him and later complained to police who issued her with a warning, but her harassment continued.

The court heard how she even turned up at the vicar's home that he shared with wife Helen and two children in North Walsham.

She also declared her love for him in four Valentine's day cards on February 14 last year, describing him as 'the love of my life' and saying, 'I will be your sweetheart if you will be mine'.

Ms Peace who is jobless and lives on income support and Disability Living Allowance was also banned from going to any church service in which Mr Rengert is taking part or officiating.

The court was told how Nr Rengert first became concerned about Ms Peace's 'over familiarity' when she started writing to him and calling him by his first name.

He told her to contact another priest instead of him after she asked him to 'cleanse' her home, but she ignored the request and carried on writing to him and leaving messages on his phone.

Ms Peace sent a birthday card to the curate's wife in October 2010, and sent another card to his family in January 2011.

Two months later in March last year she turned up at his house with flowers. Peace continued to phone the curate and write him letters which were 'full of sexual innuendo', prompting him to write back to her asking her to stop after taking advice from a community psychiatric nurse.

A few days later she sent him a letter of apology, but she continued to send cards and letters including letters mentioning his wife and son.

One card mentioned wanting to give him 'a mental cuddle'. She also sent the curate's son a birthday gift of a DVD and a book. Peace was given a notice by police in November 2011, requiring to stop harassing Mr Rengert, but three months later she sent him the four Valentine's Day cards, signing them, 'Love from M'.

She continued to send other letters 'in the same vein', even referring to the Mr Rengert's wife as his sister. Mr Rengert opened a letter received last May in the presence of police officers.

He said it had left him feeling 'pretty disgusted and really stressed out' The Ven Jan McFarlane, the Archdeacon of Norwich, said after an earlier hearing: 'Anyone who has ever suffered from such a high degree of unwanted and unwelcome attention will know just how distressing and exhausting it is.

'Keith and his family have endured such persistent attention for nearly two years and are hopeful that it will all soon come to an end. Keith is an excellent priest who simply wants quietly to get on with his ministry.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
