Celtic defender Adam Matthews remembers Celtic being written off during his first season at Parkhead before bouncing back to claim the title.

Now the Welsh defender insists Ronny Deila's men can do the same.

The shock 1-0 defeat to Hamilton 10 days ago means the Scottish champions have dropped 10 Scottish Premiership points this season.

Celtic defender Adam Matthews is refusing to press the panic button despite his side's worrying form 

Celtic slumped to a shock 1-0 loss to Hamilton; the Scottish champions have dropped 10 points this season

They trail table-topping Accies by six points as they languish in sixth place, albeit having played a game less.

That miserable start to the campaign has left their new Norwegian boss in the firing line of frustrated fans.

But Matthews says Celtic can learn a lesson from the team which fought back from a 3-0 half-time deficit against Kilmarnock three years ago as they looked set to drop 18 points behind rivals Rangers.

The full-back told the Celtic View: 'The main thing is to have a good team spirit. In my first season, we won the league and we won the league and we were 15 points behind at one stage, but just after Christmas we were one point ahead.

These are worrying times for Ronny Deila's men at Parkhead as Celtic sit on sixth place in the League table 

'A big turning point was the game at Kilmarnock. Being 3-0 down at half-time, people felt that was it and we were going to be 18 points behind in the league so it may have been too much.

'But getting the three goals in the second half and getting the draw gave us a boost of confidence that we could go on a good run and that's what happened.

'So you need to have a good team spirit and stay together. That team were good at doing that and I'm sure this one can be as well.

'Every time we lose, especially the next day, the atmosphere isn't great and we are all a bit quiet and down.

'Overall, though, the boys are upbeat and are looking good in training. In parts of the game against Hamilton, we looked like a good team, but we just need to do that for the full 90 minutes, and if we can do that then we can go on a long unbeaten run.

'It's a bad start for us but with the players we have, we can put a good run together and I'm sure we can climb back up the league.

'We just need to keep calm, keep doing what we are doing in training and then do that when we play at the weekend.'

Matthews is hoping to make his Celtic return soon after missing the last six weeks with a groin injury.

The 22-year-old has not played since limping off at half-time during the 1-1 draw with Dundee on August 31.

The former Cardiff man - whose current side face Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday - said: 'It's always frustrating being injured.

'You obviously want to be out there helping the boys but I'm sure we will get it together and click soon.

'Some of the football we have been playing has been good but we just haven't managed to get the results we have wanted.

'I felt good in pre-season and the way the team was playing suits me as a full-back, so I was enjoying it. Everyone gets injuries so I can't get too down about it and just need to try to get fit and back in the team.'
