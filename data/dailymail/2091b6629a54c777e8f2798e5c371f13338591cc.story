Chloe Newman, 14, has been missing since January 7. She was last seen getting into a black car at Haywards Heath railway station in West Sussex

Two men and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of child abduction in connection with the disappearance of a 14-year-old schoolgirl who went missing 10 days ago.

Chloe Newman, from Uckfield, East Sussex, was last seen getting into a black car at Haywards Heath railway station in West Sussex at 2.50pm on January 7.

Yesterday, police searching for the missing teenager arrested a 33-year-old woman, 16-year-old boy and 22-year-old man.

The trio, who are all of Newhaven, East Sussex, were questioned by officers before being released on police bail until April 11 while officers from Sussex Police carry out further inquiries to find her.

Detectives are also searching a home in Newhaven as appeals continue for anyone who spots her to contact police urgently.

Detective Inspector Gavin Patch, of Sussex Police, said: 'Chloe has been missing for more than a week and we are becoming increasingly concerned about her welfare.

'We are now treating her as a high-risk missing person because of her age, the length of time she has been missing and the fact that she has been associating with older people.'

Officers are now treating the schoolgirl as a 'high-risk missing 
person'. Several people have told police they think they may have seen 
her since January 7, but none of the sightings have been confirmed.

When she went missing, Chloe was wearing a pink hooded jacket with black sleeveless jacket, black trousers, blue Vans trainers and large earrings. She is slim and had her long blonde hair tied up in a ponytail.

Anyone with information should call Sussex Police on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
