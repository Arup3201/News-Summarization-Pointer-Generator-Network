Twins who had to be resuscitated moments after being born ten weeks prematurely have finally recovered enough to go home.

Parents Mark and Hayley Steabler, both 31, today described the terrifying moment they watched as a team of 11 medics battled to save their newborns at Tyneside District Hospital.

Since then siblings Jack and Erin Steabler have battled conditions such as a bleed on the brain, and heart and lung problems, but have now gone home after nearly four months.

Home: Mark and Hayley Steabler, both 31, are back at home with twins Jack and Erin Steabler, aged four months, after the pair were caught in a desperate struggle for life after being born ten weeks premature

Fight: Mr Steabler described how he watched a team of 11 medics working to get baby Jack to breathe just seconds after he was born, saying he was 'terrified'

Holding on: After being resuscitated the babies then battled through conditions including bleeding on the brain, and heart and lung problems

Mr Steabler said: 'I remember seeing doctors just working on Jack, trying to get him breathing again, and I just felt terrified.

'We didn't know what was going to happen to either of them, and that's the worst feeling in the world.'

Mark's wife, Hayley, 31, suffered no complications during her pregnancy and during her 20-week scan the couple were told they would be having twins.

But at 30 weeks, Hayley suddenly went into labour and was taken to South Tyneside District Hospital.

Mark, of Blackfell, Washington, said: 'They had hoped to transfer us to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, but there was no time and she underwent an emergency Caesarean Section.

'They brought in a team of medics from the RVI. There were about 10 or 11 of them all in theatre with us ready to help.'

Desperate: Doctors had hoped to Mrs Steabler to Newcastle Royal Infirmary, but there was no time, so instead a specialist team of 11 was brought to her (pictured, Jack in his incubator)

Stable: After they started breathing again Jack (pictured), who weighed 3lb 5oz and Erin, weighing 2lb 5oz, were transferred to Newcastle and spent several more months receiving specialist treatment

Seconds after they were born, Jack weighing 3lb 5oz and Erin 2lb 5oz, the team realised the babies were not breathing properly and began trying to resuscitate them.

Mark said: 'Hayley and I didn't know what was going to happen. Because they were so small we knew they would have problems breathing by themselves. We'd had no sleep and were shattered.'

Both children were put on ventilators to help them breath and transferred to the University Hospital of North Tees where they spent the next two months in special care.

Jack had suffered a bleed on the brain while Erin had problems after she vomited blood.

The pair were then transferred up to the RVI where they spent another month before finally being allowed home just a few weeks ago.

Mark said the pair, now four months old, are slowly starting to recover.

Recovery: Jack has a heart murmur which will require surgery, and Erin is being tube fed, but both are now back at home and on the road to recovery

He said: 'Jack does have a heart murmur which means he will need an operation in the future. He also has to have some scans this week to keep a check on any concerns about blood on the brain.

'Erin is on a feeding machine 24 hours a day at the minute. Obviously the last few months have been a lot of work for us. Because there are two of them, it's double the worry.'

Mark, an insurance investigator, has been forced to take time off work, while Hayley is currently on maternity leave from her job as a manager for a plumber's merchant.

Now, Mark, along with some work colleagues, is planning to take part in the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge in a bid to raise money for the RVI's Tiny Lives appeal.
