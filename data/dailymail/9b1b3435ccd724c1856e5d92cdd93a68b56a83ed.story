One, two, three, pounce! 

British photographer Andy Skillen captured the moment a peckish arctic fox at Seal River in Hudson Bay, Canada, tried to break through solid ice in a bid to catch a tasty treat. Images show it starting off on two feet before leaping in the air and head-diving back down.

However, the ravenous animal's tactics failed to work and he ended up faceplanting in the snow instead. Skillen said the plucky fox continued his attempts to puncture the frozen surface for almost three hours.

Yet due to his light frame, the fox was unable to make any headway in temperatures around minus 35 degrees Celsius.

Pick yourself up and try again: However, the ravenous animal's tactics failed to work and he ended up faceplanting in the snow instead - Skillen said the plucky fox continued his attempts to puncture the frozen surface for almost three hours

As a result of limited food supplies in the area, Skillen believed the fox was looking for kelp trapped beneath the frozen ice.

He said: 'Unfortunately the fox was not a 1000 pound bear and punching holes in the frozen bay was always going to be an impossible job.

'However he was at least persistent and dogged.

'These pictures have been met with wonder and the sequence was highly commended.

'The Arctic remains a true untrammeled wilderness.' 

Arctic Foxes can grow up to three feet long and weigh between five and 15 pounds. The species can be found in North America from western Alaska east through northern Canada in the Northwest Territories, Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec.

It is also found in the arctic regions of Europe, Asia, Iceland and Greenland.  

It is an opportunistic eater, usually feasting on small mammals like lemmings, voles, and ground squirrels; birds; insects; eggs; berries and carrion. In the winter, it often follows polar bears and wolves to eat their leftover kill.

Let's hope Skillen's fox managed to forage some food in the end.
