Sir Alan Smith, the wingman of World War II hero Sir Douglas Bader, has died aged 95.

The pilot flew alongside Britain's most famous airman on several missions during the war, protecting him from enemy fire.

After being personally selected by Sir Douglas to fly with him, Sir Alan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1941.

With at least 20 confirmed kills, Sir Alan retired from the RAF in 1945 with more than 1,500 flying hours.

On his first mission without his wingman, who had been grounded due to a bout of flu, Sir Douglas was shot down and captured by enemy troops.

The pilot, who famously lost both his legs
in a pre-war air accident, was then held as a prisoner of war until the 
conflict's end, despite a number of escape attempts.

The father-of-five, who was knighted in 1982, died in Perth Royal Infirmary last Friday. He joined the RAF Voluntary Reserve just before the war, soon learning how to fly Tiger moths.

But with only 14 hours of flight experience, he was called up to full-time duty and was flying Spitfires within a year.

Previously describing his traingin, he said: 'The instructor merely pointed out the various levers, patted me on the back and said 'best of luck'.'

He transferred to RAF Tangmere just one month before Sir Douglas arrived, personally selecting his longstanding wingman.

Sir Alan said previously: 'He came into the 
dispersal hut, got his eyes on me and said 'What's your name?'

''Smith, 
sir,' I said. 'Right you'll do. Fly as my number two and God help you if
you let any Hun get on my tail'.'

Missions: Sir Douglas flew with Sir Alan as his Spitfire wingman on several occasions throughout the war. Sir Douglas crashed and was captured on his first mission without Sir Alan during the war

Capture: On his first mission without his wingman, who was forced to stay grounded due to flu, Sir Douglas was forced to land his plane in France and was captured by Nazis

He performed his duty until August 9 1941 when he was ordered to remain on the ground after falling ill - the same day Sir Douglas was forced to ground his plane over France, spending the next few years infuriating the 
Nazis with his repeated escape attempts.

Sir Alan was later posted to Balado aerodrome to train new pilots, where he met local woman Margaret Todd while she was working for the Women's Voluntary Service.

The couple married in Kinross in 1943 and went on to have two daughters and three sons between 1945 and 1959.

Born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, he dropped out of school aged 14 to assist his mother Lilian after his father Captain Alfred Smith was lost at sea.

He was the youngest of four sons, while his parents had also adopted a daughter.

He eventually set up his own business selling sweets and tobacco after working as in an ironmongery with his mother for a year before joining the RAF. 

After his retirement from the airforce, Sir Alan settled in Kinrossshire, Scotland, to teach pilots and became active in the community.

After the war ended he began working for his father-in-law Herbert Todd at the local woollen mill, Todd and Duncan Ltd.

Under his management the company evolved into Dawson International Ltd.

His youngest son Stuart said his father put his longevity down to hard work, self-discipline and a healthy lifestyle.

He said he admired his father's generosity, fairness and integrity.

Escapee: Sir Douglas Bader was sent to Colditz after several escape attempts, where he stayed until the end of the war

From the moment Sir Douglas Bader's plane crashed in 1931, it appeared he would be lucky to live, let alone fly again.

While
trying low-flying aerobatics his aircraft crashed when the tip of the 
left wing touched the ground and both his legs were amputated – one 
above and one below the knee. But he wouldn't be deterred and managed to
rejoin the RAF in 1939 when war broke out and within two years he was a
squadron leader.

In 1941 he
was shot down and captured in France. German forces treated Bader with 
great respect. He lost his prosthetic leg when he bailed out and the 
Germans allowed a new one to be dropped in by the British.

From then came his series of escapes. He tried so many the Germans threatened to take away his legs.

Bader
escaped from a hospital by tying together a number of sheets but was 
betrayed by a hospital worker. After the war, the French authorities 
sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.

In
1942 he escaped with three others from Stalag Luft III only to be found
a few days later - the Germans were so concerned by his attempts they 
produced a poster describing him and how he walked so the public could 
spot him if he fled again.

Finally he was sent to Colditz staying there until the end of the war - but he had tried his best to get out before then.
