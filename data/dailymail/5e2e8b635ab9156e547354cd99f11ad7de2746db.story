Newly crowned Masters champion Bubba Watson was heading back to be with his newly-adopted baby son today - hours after putting on his green jacket.

The golfer, 33, and his wife Angie celebrated adopting a one-month-old boy called Caleb just a fortnight ago.

Bubba, a big-hitting golfer, last night won the Masters after hitting a dramatic 250-yard shot on his way to victory on an extraordinary final day at Augusta.

He defeated South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen on the second hole in a play-off to win his first major title.

And it was double joy for the golfer from Bagdad, Florida, who became a father for the first time after adopting because his wife Angie is unable to have children.

After sealing a dramatic victory, Bubba said he was looking forward to going home to see his boy - but admitted he had not yet changed a nappy.

He said: 'I can't wait to get back. I haven't changed a diaper yet so probably going to have to change a 
diaper pretty soon.

'I don't want to change a diaper. 
Hopefully this will give me a week or two to just watch her again. Maybe
 not, though.'

The golfer won $1.44million 
(£900,000) in prize money as he won his first major.

Yesterday he broke down and cried hard on his mother Molly's shoulder as they embraced on the 10th green.

The new champion's success is even more 
impressive given that he has never had a formal golf lesson in his life,
 being self-taught ever since his father first showed him how to hold a 
club.

His father Garry died from throat cancer in 2010.

Garry introduced him to golf when he 
took him to a golf course aged six. And despite becoming a dedicated 
player he never had a formal lesson in his life.

He doesn't employ a coach or a sports psychologist to improve his game - and his go for broke playing style is unique.

Bubba, a committed Christian, said after his Easter Sunday win: 'My dad's not here, but he's watching in heaven.'

The golfer, who has one of the longest drives in the sport, has always been regarded as a poor putter.

It was Watson's dramatic shot on the 10th hole that helped him win the tournament.

Trapped among the trees 155 yards 
from the hole and unable to see the green, the left-hander hit a huge 
hook and landed the ball safely on the green.

From there, Watson caught up to with 
Oosthuizen who looked set to win by making four consecutive birdies on 
holes 13 through to 16.

Nobody was surprised that Bubba - real 
name Gerry - blubbed because he has after all his wins, but there was an
 added reason for the tears this time - his month-old son Caleb.

Masters champion Bubba Watson was given his unusual name by his father.

Although he was named Gerry when he was born he has always been known by his more folksy name.

The golfer claimed his father Garry named him Bubba because he was a fat and ugly child.

Garry Watson - who first introduced his son to the sport he conquered yesterday - died from throat cancer in 2010.

Bubba said it was his father who gave him his unusual name.

'I’d say 10 seconds after I was born, my
 daddy took a good look at me,' the golfer said in a previous interview.

'He said I was so fat 
and ugly, "Let's call him Bubba."'

The nickname Bubba is given to the oldest male child in a family in some southern U.S. states.

For some the nickname sticks. It is an endearing name sometimes given to overweight men - which is probably why Bubba's father gave him the name when his large baby was born.

Former President Bill Clinton was given the nickname Bubba in many of the southern states.

Watson and his wife Angie started the process of adopting four years ago.

'It finally came to this winter that we could do it,' he said.

'We got turned down a couple times, but on the Tuesday of Bay Hill (three weeks ago) we got a call, on the Wednesday we made the decision and the Monday after we were down in South Florida, picking up little Caleb.'

Bubba's wife Angie, a former Olympic-standard basketball player, stands head and shoulders above other golfing WAGs at 6ft 4in tall.

She met Bubba when they were both at the University Of Georgia and they got married in September 2004.

The basketball player told Bubba on their first date they she would never be able to have children.

When injury finally put paid to her professional career, she decided to do become her husband's agent.

Asked if he had dreamed about a putt to win The Masters he added: 'I dreamed about it - I just never made the putt.'

He won the tournament with a tap in from six inches.

'I wanted to make sure I focused hard 
on that putt, because I knew how delicate these situations are and how 
this may never happen again.'

Oosthuizen was trying to become the 
first South African winner in five years after Trevor Immelman and last 
year's champion Charl Schwartzel.
