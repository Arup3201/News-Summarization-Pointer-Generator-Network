Four separate bombs were detonated in
a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in the Ukraine today, raising
fears that this summer's Euro 2012 football tournament could be targeted.

Up to 27 people were injured when the
devices, which were planted in rubbish bins, exploded at short 
intervals in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, authorities said.

The Ukraine is preparing to co-host the European Championships with Poland this summer.

England's first group stage match against France on June 11 is due to be held at the Donbass Arena, 150 miles away in Donetsk.

Today's bombings are the latest blow for the country that had hoped to use the football tournament to showcase its modern outlook.

A shadow has already been cast over the Kiev government, with calls for a boycott by Western politicians because of the country's jailing of its former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

President Viktor Yanukovich said the bomb blasts were 'a challenge ... to the whole country.'

The first blast occurred at a tram stop at 11.50am (8.50am GMT), injuring 13 people.

The second explosion came 30 minutes later next to a cinema, injuring 11 people, nine of them children, the Emergencies Ministry said in a statement.

The third blast followed shortly afterwards next to a park, injuring 2 people, it said. It was unclear whether there were any injuries from the fourth explosion which also took place in the downtown area.

Police said the blasts had been caused by explosive devices planted in trash bins.

Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko immediately left for Dnipropetrovsk to head an investigation, police said.

'No-one has been detained yet,' a police spokesman said.

Authorities offered no immediate explanation of any motive or say who they thought could be behind the bombs.

But the prosecutor general's office said it had launched a criminal case classifying the blasts as an 'act of terrorism'.

Dnipropetrovsk, 250 miles southeast of the capital Kiev, is one of the former Soviet republic's biggest industrial hubs and was a key centre of the nuclear, arms and space industries in Soviet times.

The city provided a springboard for former President Leonid Kuchma, who was in office from 1994-2005, to rise to power. It is also the birthplace of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.              

Bomb attacks have been rare in the former Soviet republic which will co-host the European football championship in June and July.           

But political tension is high because of the detention of Tymoshenko who was jailed for seven years last October for alleged abuse-of-office which she denies.

Her imprisonment has prompted sharp criticism from Western governments which see her trial as political revenge by Mr Yanukovich, who narrowly beat her for the presidency in February 2010.

Earlier this week it emerged the 51-year-old is on hunger strike after being 'beaten' by guards in 
jail where she claims she is a political prisoner.

Ukrainian officials admitted that warders 
manhandled the opposition leader - once dubbed the Thatcher of Eastern 
Europe - after she refused to have hospital treatment for a longstanding 
spine complaint, fearing that state-appointed medics would poison her or
infect her with a disease.
