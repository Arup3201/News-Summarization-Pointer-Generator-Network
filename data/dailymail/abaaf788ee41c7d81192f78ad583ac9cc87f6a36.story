Amir Khan may be just over a month away from a headline fight in Las Vegas, but he is still finding time to live the high-life.

The British welterweight had been training in California, but after a week of watching top sporting contests he splashed out on a private jet to fly to Vancouver on Monday night.

Khan posted pictures of his trip to Instagram, including showing off the cockpit of the jet and commented 'It's all about going private'.

Khan said it was 'Good to see the boys in Vancouver' on arrival, after completing the short flight

Hours later the Bolton-born fighter posted again on his arrival in Vancouver, in a restaurant with some friends.

Khan has been in California training, and taking in some of the biggest sporting events in America, ahead of his next fight.

Amir Khan will return to the ring in December for the first time since he beat Luis Collazo in Las Vegas in May
