A 45-year-old Portuguese mother was in custody in France last night after her 'secret' baby was found naked, filthy and shivering in the boot of her car.

The woman, who is believed to have kept the birth a secret from her husband, left her vehicle at a garage where mechanics discovered the baby, said by some sources to be 12 months old and others 23 months, after hearing her wailing.

The child was lying in a basket and suffering from dehydration according to reports.

A 45-year-old Portuguese mother was in custody in France last night after her 'secret' baby was found naked, filthy and shivering in the boot of her car in Brignac-la-Plaine

When they opened the boot, they told Police, there was an overpowering stench.

Investigators and medics rushed to the scene and took the infant into care.

The mother and her husband  -who was reportedly drunk in charge of his scooter -  were arrested.

DNA tests on the child were ordered yesterday to establish her exact age and prove she was born to the woman.

Neighbours of the couple who lived at Brignac-La -Plaine in the Correze department of SW France were incredulous at news of the discovery.

'They are people like any others and not dirty.

'I went to their house several times and there was never any trace of a baby.

'We never noticed that she was pregnant', said a villager.

The couple's three other children had attended the local school and appeared normal.

According to Sud Ouest newspaper, the mother told gendarmes that she had kept the birth of the child a secret and her husband was unaware of her existence.

She had given birth to the baby in a corridor at the couple's house aided by a neighbour, it was said.
