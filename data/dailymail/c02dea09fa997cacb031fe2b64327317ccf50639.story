Her provocative pose, thigh-high stockings and black bondage-style bra look fit for the heroine of Fifty Shades Of Grey. In fact, the only thing missing is a riding crop.

In other photographs, the heavily made-up twentysomething model wears lacy hold-ups, cut-out knickers and a plunging bodysuit which leaves little to the imagination.

But this isn’t a campaign for Victoria’s Secret or even Anne Summers. Instead, they’re the newly-released images from Marks & Spencer’s revamped Autumn/Winter lingerie line, masterminded by its latest style director Belinda Earl.

Black marks: M&S's lingerie collection is decidedly risque

Her new clothing collection for the struggling retailer was rapturously received when it was unveiled this month, with commentators praising the flattering cuts and grown-up detail. 

However, Belinda’s lingerie line is ‘adult’ in a rather different way.

Judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling, the nation’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky, stocking-clad foot.

For who on earth thought that putting the S&M into good old M&S was a sensible idea? Could it be that falling profits and dire clothing sales have got someone’s knickers in a twist?

After all, the average shopper at M&S is a size 14-16, 49-year-old mother who probably doesn’t want to go out feeling as trussed-up as an oven-ready chicken. 

'Judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling, the nation’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky, stocking-clad foot'

In these straitened times, it also seems unlikely she’ll be willing to pay £19.50 for a pair of knickers and £35 for a slip from this collection. 

Most women I know go into M&S for comfy underwear that will wash well, doesn’t break the bank and won’t dig into the skin, bag, sag or show under clothing and will look subtly sexy in front of their husbands. They’re just not in the market for becoming Miss Whiplash.

Just because almost every woman in the country has read Fifty Shades Of Grey doesn’t mean we want to act it out. And to assume so is, frankly, insulting.

Now don’t get me wrong. I may be 60, but I’m no prude when it comes to underwear - or anything else.

This week, I’ve been devouring a very raunchy contemporary retelling of Lady Chatterley’s Lover - I Take You, by Nikki Gemmell - in preparation for a Hay Festival debate about women and erotica at which I’m speaking. In Gemmell’s book, the heroine doesn’t wear knickers at all.  

Feminine: Linda approved of the sensuous silks and subtle prints in M&S's range with Rosie Huntington-Whitley

When Agent Provocateur entrepreneurs Joseph Corré and Serena Rees took risque underwear mainstream in 1994, they proved sexiness wasn’t just the province of men in dirty raincoats.

Kate Moss and Kylie Minogue stripped off for the brand and it went global, with Corré and Rees reported to have sold 80 per cent of their business for a cool £60 million in 2007.

Smalls are big business, as also evidenced by Victoria’s Secret’s flagship store on Bond Street.

Women, these days, see no contradiction between femininity and feminism. Outrageous underwear is part of our seduction tool kit.

I’m an underwear addict and love sexy smalls, but I don’t want to buy them from M&S.

Why? Well, there’s enough pressure on women to act like sex objects 24/7 without M&S wading in. It’s like finding an old and trusted friend is moonlighting as a stripper.

When I split from my husband at the age of 55, one of the first things I did was go on an underwear binge on a just-in-case basis.

I bypassed M&S and spent an entire day at Selfridges, Myla and Calvin Klein before settling for three bra-and-pants sets (one in jade, one in raspberry and one in black), plus several pairs of hold‑ups, which set me back close to £300. 

Traditional market: M&S lingerie is usually popular because of its comfort over style

Even though I was worrying about how I was going to pay my bills, I felt this was an indulgence I deserved. It was many months before anyone actually got to see any of it, but these subtly sexy sets under my jeans and T-shirts gave me a confidence boost when I needed it most.

And that’s where the M&S range goes wrong - it seems more about pandering to male fantasies than quietly making women feel good about themselves.

With the multitude of straps and bondage-like constructions, I’m reminded of the Red Room of Pain in Fifty Shades Of Grey rather than getting the support I want when I wear something tight and want to avoid anyone glimpsing bulging back fat or a post-menopause pot belly.

Of course, this bizarre departure from its heartland style could have a lot to do with the fact that the foundations of M&S’s underwear department have been crumbling for some time.

In January this year, Janie Schaffer, former chief creative officer at Victoria’s Secret and original founder of the Knickerbox chain, was hauled in to revamp M&S’s lingerie.

But by April, she had resigned, citing excessive red tape and meddling from on high, with insiders hinting there was a culture clash. 

Misguided revamp: Linda fears the new range could alienate die-hard customers of the ailing store

Then last week, M&S reported its lowest pre-tax profits for eight years, at just £564 million, compared to £658 million a year ago. This decline took place before M&S hired its latest weapon, Belinda Earl, 51, to stop the rot.

But it seems that instead of underpinning her new strategy with underwear that’s as on-the-button as her classic outerwear, what women really want has been roundly ignored in favour of lingerie likely to attract headlines.

Which is strange, as underwear is big business at Marks.

It remains the nation’s leading retailer, selling more than 61 million pairs of knickers a year, with different shapes and sizes, ranging from six to 28. They say one in three women buy their lingerie at Marks & Spencer.

What do they think this misguided revamp will achieve?

New direction: Belinda Earl is M&S's latest style director

Of course, I expect M&S to modernise along with the rest of the High Street, but isn’t the point that Marks has always embodied traditional values? I go to there to feel safe and comfortable. I expect good value for money.

When I talk to my friends, all ‘women of a certain age’, they want the same things from the M&S underwear department: sales people on the floor who can actually advise you (I’ve not been able to find one there for years, at least not without a 20-minute hunt and then practically having to beg for help); shapewear that doesn’t constrict; knickers that don’t leave you worrying about a visible panty line; and bras that give you a boost without looking like armour.

The words ‘flattering’ and ‘feminine’ come up often; the word ‘sexy’, in relation to M&S, never.

‘I love saucy underwear,’ says one friend, ‘but I’m just not in the mood for it when I go to M&S. I mean, the lighting’s enough to put you off for a start - you can see every lump and wobble. ‘I’ll get my sexy knicker kicks elsewhere, thank you.’ 

Another friend scoffs when I showed her the publicity pictures. ‘I’m 56 and a size 16. I’d feel an idiot trussed up like that.’

My 60-year-old neighbour remarks: ‘If I suddenly came into the boudoir wearing that after 30 years of marriage, I think my husband would have a heart attack.’

It seemed to me that M&S was getting something very right when it launched model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s range last year.

The sensuous silks and subtle prints made for a distinctly feminine collection that was a huge sales hit and is still going strong. So why it has veered off in this bordello direction is a mystery.

So, dear M&S, for whom I still have a lingering affection, please get your initials in order. Repeat after me: S&M is just not required. Leave that to other shops and stick to classy, classic cuts.

Perhaps the time has come for your customers to whip you into shape, rather than the other way around.
