Mary Smith, 100, managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter

A 100-year-old great-grandmother managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter.

Mary Smith, who is partially deaf and blind, was taking her dog and a neighbour's for a walk  in Rugby, Warwickshire, when she was attacked by the group of three or four boys.

As the children, who were aged around ten, tried to drag her from her scooter and rifle through her bags, Mrs Smith grabbed her dog Xena and the other pet and drove straight at the gang, forcing them to scatter.

The former Second World War dispatch rider then escaped on her high-speed scooter. 

Her daughter Rita Doggrell, 77, who also lives in Rugby, said her mother did not understand what was happening when she was set on by the boys.  

'I can’t quite believe the lack of respect these boys showed to a woman of mum’s age,' she said.

'She had just started to go around the path and was taking her own dog and the neighbour’s dog for a walk when they just set upon her.

'Mum suffers quite badly with blindness and loss of hearing and can only really make out shapes so she couldn’t tell what was happening to begin with.

'She knows that a group of three or four young boys approached her and started trying to get her out of her mobility scooter. One of them even got onto it at one point.'

Mrs Doggrell said her mother, who she described as inspirational for her age, was remarkably unshaken by the ordeal.

'Unfortunately nobody else was around to help,' she said. 'But thankfully she was able to fight them off, grab the dogs and get away from them.

'She is incredibly strong and very good for age so she just took it in her stride.

Smith, who is partially deaf and blind, was taking her dog and a neighbour's for a walk in this park in Rugby, Warwickshire, when she was attacked by the boys, thought to be from a nearby illegal traveller camp

'But it is completely unacceptable something like this should happen.'

Widow Mrs Smith became the oldest person in Europe to have a pioneering cochlea implant earlier this year.

The mother-of-three, who also has six grandchildren, did not report the attack to police.
