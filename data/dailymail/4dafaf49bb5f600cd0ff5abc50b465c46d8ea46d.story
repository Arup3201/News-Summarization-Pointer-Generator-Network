Alan Irvine has never sought an explanation why he was left behind at Everton when his friend David Moyes took over at Manchester United last year and took other members of the Goodison Park backroom team to join him.

‘I was never asked and I didn’t expect to be asked,’ said West Brom head coach Irvine, who had worked with Moyes for eight years on Merseyside, first as assistant manager and then academy director in a second spell at the club.

‘David is a very loyal person and he would have wanted to look after the first-team staff he had at Everton. I was in the academy so I wasn’t surprised not to get a call. I’m glad the way things worked out for me.’

West Brom head coach Alan Irvine admits to not knowing what some of his players earn per week 

The Scot can afford to be relaxed about it. Sitting in his office awaiting the visit of Louis van Gaal’s ‘new United’ on Monday night, he is enjoying his unlikely opportunity in the top flight limelight.

Known as a hard-working and diligent coach, his days as a No 1 appeared over after being sacked by lower league clubs Preston and Sheffield Wednesday, despite a 40 per cent winning ratio at both.

But when West Brom decided they could do with less drama after dressing-room fights and Nicolas Anelka’s infamous quenelle gesture last season, they turned to the healing powers of Irvine, who helped develop the talent of Wayne Rooney, among others, in his career.

‘It’s a chance I didn’t really expect but I’ve got unfinished business,’ says Irvine. ‘My other two jobs in management were extremely tough. I was at clubs where I had to do everything myself.

‘Preston only had one scout and Wednesday didn’t even have that. I’d spend my nights up and down the motorways checking on players and then have to go in the next morning bright and bubbly for training.

Irvine was sacked by both Preston North End (left) and Sheffield Wednesday after unforgiving tasks 

‘I once signed seven players while I was on holiday because the deals wouldn’t have been done otherwise. But West Brom is different. I can concentrate on what I do and enjoy best, working on the training pitch and analysing games. There are other people to do other things.

‘At Wednesday I did the contract negotiations but here I don’t even know what some of the players earn... and that’s fine by me.’

Irvine’s summer appointment underwhelmed many Albion fans who wanted a bigger, more experienced name. The dissenters were not exactly pacified by two draws and two defeats in Albion’s opening four games. But evidence the players were buying into Irvine’s methods were underlined by a run of three wins in a row against Tottenham, Hull and Burnley. They were unlucky to lose their last match 2-1 at Liverpool.

England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino has emerged as the country’s hottest young striker with six goals this season under Irvine’s watchful eye. Last season Berahino stunned United and Moyes with the winner as Albion won at Old Trafford for the first time since 1978.

Grey-haired Irvine may resemble a friendly neighbour rather than someone who would headbutt an opposing player or shove a rival, as other Premier League managers have done. But it would be wrong to dismiss him as a boardroom patsy simply because he carries the title of head coach rather than manager.

‘People make a thing of that but there’s no real difference between the power I’ve got compared with other Premier League managers,’ he says. ‘Yes, I am sure West Brom would sell a player I don’t want to lose if the price is high enough. But that happens everywhere. Do you think the Spurs manager wanted to sell Gareth Bale? Once a value is met, the club decide.

‘On signing players, the club were already down the line with Craig Gardner and Brown Ideye before I was appointed. But it doesn’t mean I don’t consider them my players.

‘Craig has been brilliant and played every game. I do my own research on potential targets. I rang Neil Lennon about Georgios Samaras because he knew him well from Celtic. The club take my views into account. We’ve pulled the plug on one or two if they’ve not been a good fit.’

Goalkeeper Ben Foster has continued his fine form between the sticks for the Baggies since Irvine's arrival 

Berahino has gone on record that Irvine’s approachable manner has helped after losing his way under Pepe Mel. Also, centre-half Craig Dawson has become a regular after being overlooked by previous managers.

‘Craig wanted to go to Burnley in the summer, (but) I promised him if he got in the team and played well, I’d keep him in,’ said Irvine. ‘And that is what’s happened.’

The experience of older players Joleon Lescott, Gareth McAuley, Chris Brunt, Ben Foster and Jonas Olsson is also valued. Lescott, who left Manchester City in the summer, has been quizzed by Irvine about any useful tips picked up with the Premier League champions.

Irvine has always been thorough, bordering on workaholic. But he accepts that learning when to switch off can be vital. For the first time, he has just taken a mid-season break, spending four days in Spain during the international fixture list.

‘Terry [Burton], our technical director, said I should go away, it was a new thing for me but I’m glad I did,’ he says with a smile.

Irvine was heavily involved in bringing through a teenage Wayne Rooney at Everton over a decade ago 

He has seen United live three times this season to prepare for Monday.

‘Of course they have fantastic players but every team has a weakness somewhere and it’s up to us to try and exploit it,’ he says.

Rooney will miss the game with suspension and an additional bonus for Irvine is that several of his players have returned after positive results with their country, most notably the Northern Ireland trio of Brunt, McAuley and Chris Baird.

United sacked Moyes and his assistants Steve Round and Jimmy Lumsden (who both followed him from Everton) after just 10 months and have changed half of their team since then, with stellar names like Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind signing for big money.

Loyally, Irvine feels he should have been facing his friend across the technical area. ‘David would have got it right at United, I am sure of that,’ he said.

It is just another incentive for the Premier League’s most surprising manager to pull off another tale of the unexpected.
