Burger King has cut soft drinks from its children’s menu amid pressure to promote a healthier image.

The fast food chain's kids' meal combinations now include an option of 100 per cent apple juice, fat-free milk or one per cent fat chocolate milk.

The beverages roughly contain the same amount of calories and sugar as a classic Coca Cola, but experts highlight they have a better nutritional profile. 

Indeed, the milk is described an 'excellent source of calcium and a good source of potassium' while the apple juice apparently contains 'one-and-a-half servings of fruit'.

A spokesperson for Burger King told Daily Mail Online that the decision to drop soda for young consumers came after a review of 'established scientific and government [nutritional] standards'.

McDonald's and Wendy's are other eateries to implement similar changes in recent months.

While fizzy drinks are still on offer at Burger King's Canadian and U.S. restaurants, these beverages will have to be purchased separately to kids' meals.

The four main course options on offer to children include a  hamburger, cheeseburger, chicken nuggets or oatmeal.

Satisfries French Fries or apple slices are offered as side items.

Burger King adds that all of these offerings are 'fully compliant with the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative pledge'.

The oath states that meal combinations aimed at youngsters must not contain more than 600 calories or 740 milligrams of sodium among other things.

When it comes to the new 'child-friendly' beverages at Burger King, the 100 per cent apple juice contains 80 calories; the fat-free milk comes in at 90, while the  one per cent fat chocolate milk has a slightly higher content at 180.

The same pour size (8fl oz) of full-fat Coca Cola totals 70 calories. 

Many healthy eating advocates have applauded Burger King's move and called on other restaurants to follow suit. 

Margo Wootan, a director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, notes that sugary soft drinks are a top source of calories in children's diets and a major contributor to obesity.

She told CBS News that steering children away from soda early on will get them on track toward healthier eating in the future.

'Fewer kids [will be] conditioned to think that soda should be a part of every eating out occasion,' she added.
