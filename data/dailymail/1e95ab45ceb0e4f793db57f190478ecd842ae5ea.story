Shola Ameobi is being tracked by West Bromwich Albion, Hull City and Crystal Palace after the 33-year-old was released from a contract with Turkish side Gaziantep.

The three Premier League clubs are all keen to bring in an experienced striker and Ameobi would be available for free.

Alan Pardew signed Yaya Sanogo on loan from Arsenal but knows 6ft 3in Ameobi very well from their days at Newcastle United, while Tony Pulis is desperate to sign a centre-forward to support Saido Berahino.

Ameobi is attracting interest from a host of Premier League clubs after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep

Steve Bruce is also on the lookout for options up front and the lack of a fee makes Ameobi, who scored 79 goals in 397 games on Tyneside, a more appetising proposition.

He scored four goals in 11 games for Gaziantep but the club suffered financial difficulties and Ameobi cut his spell short. As he is a free agent he can join a Premier League club after the January window has closed.

Ameobi scores the first of Newcastle's two goals in a 2-0 victory over Morecambe in the League Cup 

He scored 79 goals in 397 appearances in all competitions during a 14 year spell with the Tyneside club
