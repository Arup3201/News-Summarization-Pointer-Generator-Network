Marine and Patrick Wood's pet cat, Chloe, survived six weeks trapped in a chimney at their Dorset home

A homesick cat used up at least one of its nine lives after surviving for six weeks stuck inside a chimney.

The moggy, named Chloe, endured a 20ft plunge before going weeks without food and water behind the sealed up fireplace.

The stricken pet had been trying to get back into her home while her owners Marianne and Patrick Wood were on holiday.

She was pulled, barely alive from the shaft, six weeks later when the couple returned home and heard her  cries coming through the walls.

The couple had arranged with a neighbour to look after Chloe in their absence, feeding her twice a day and letting her inside at night.

But the homesick cat decided to try and break in to the house on December 6 - two days after the Woods arrived in Vietnam for a six week trip to see their son, Stephen.

Their neighbours spent a week searching for Chloe but to no avail. Mrs Wood even emailed them a photo of the seven-year-old cat from 10,000 miles away to be used on 'missing' posters.

Then the day after the couple returned home they heard a pathetic meowing from behind the sealed up fireplace in an upstairs bedroom.

Mr Wood, 74, used a knife to cut a hole through the sealant and found a skeletal-looking Chloe barely alive.

The white and ginger cat was rushed to a vets where she was found to have lost more than half her body weight and was given a 50/50 chance of survival.

She was put on a drip and fed small amounts of food to help her build her strength up and is now well enough to be allowed home.

Mrs Wood, a retired schoolteacher from Stoborough, near Wareham, Dorset, said: 'It is almost unbelievable that a cat could survive without any food or water and in a tiny space of about one foot square for six weeks.

'She was covered in cement dust from where she had desperately tried to claw her way into the room.

A vet said that if Chloe had been left for another week she would have died inside the chimney

'She was barely alive by the time we found her and the vet said had she been left for another week she would have been dead. I would think she has used up about eight of her nine lives in one go.'

The couple left for their trip to Vietnam and Australia on December 4. Two weeks before their other pet cat Honey was sadly run over and killed in an accident.

Vets found Chloe lost half her body weight during the ordeal

Neighbour Tammy Parkin, who happens to be a veterinary nurse, kindly agreed to let Chloe in and out of the house and feed her twice a day.

Mrs Wood said: 'The last time Chloe was seen was on the roof on December 6. She wouldn't have fallen down the chimney by accident because she is so sure-footed.

'She must have climbed down it as a way of getting into the house.

'Our neighbours were marvelous. They looked everywhere for her; combed farm fields, spoke to people in the village with sheds and garages and printed posters with a photo I emailed them from Vietnam.

'They did their very best to find her.

'We got back last Saturday and the next morning I was in the spare bedroom on my own and heard a pathetic meow. I thought I was going mad. Then I heard it again and thought it must be Chloe but had no idea where she was so called my husband up.

'We tracked it down to the fireplace and Patrick cut a hole in the cardboard and pulled Chloe out by the scruff of her neck, headfirst.

'She was half-dead; emaciated and couldn't see anything as her eyes were opaque. We put her down but she couldn't stand up by herself.'

Neighbour Tammy rushed the severely malnourished and dehydrated cat to her work at Castle Vets in Poundbury where she was given emergency treatment that saved her.

Vet Jeremy Wright said: 'It is extraordinary. She seems to have recovered very quickly and has bounced back.'
