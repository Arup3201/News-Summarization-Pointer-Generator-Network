One of 'the great masterpieces of British art' has been saved for the nation in a deal that will see it go on show across the country.

Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows by John Constable has been bought for £23.1 million in a deal arranged by the Tate.

The deal, with the family of the late Lord Ashton of Hyde, includes tax concessions that make it equivalent to an open market sale of £40 million.

Tate director Nicholas Serota said: 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is one of the great masterpieces of British art.

'I am extremely grateful to the owners who have worked with us while we have raised the funds to ensure the painting remains in the UK.'

A grant of £15.8 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund was central to the sale of the landscape work.

The acquisition is part of a partnership
 between the Tate and four other galleries - the National Museum of 
Wales, the National Galleries of Scotland, Colchester and Ipswich 
Museums and the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum.

All four museums will have the chance to exhibit the work, ensuring that it stays in the UK.

Jenny Abramsky, who chairs the fund, 
said the 'substantial' investment was a recognition of the painting's 
status as a 'precious and quintessentially British heritage icon'.

She said: 'It is unimaginable that this particular painting might have ended up anywhere other than a UK public collection'.

The
 1831 painting, one of the artist's large scale works known as 
'six-footers', shows the cathedral under a dark sky illuminated by a 
rainbow.

It is often 
interpreted as a metaphor for the pressure felt by the Church of England
 over its loss of political power in the period.

it was painted one year after the death of Constable's wife, Maria.

The stormy weather has also been seen to represent Constable's fragile and turbulent state of mind at the time.

But, the rainbow could represent hope at the end of a stormy period.

the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1831.

Mr Serota said there was no 'direct threat' of the work being taken out of the country, but said it was of 'such supreme importance' that 'undoubtedly there would have been institutions abroad who wanted to bring it into their collections'.

The painting will go on show in Wales next year before travelling to the other galleries.

Artist: Constable was not recognised for his work for most of his life

Salisbury cathedral from the Meadows was painted in 1831, one year after John Constable's wife Maria’s death. 

It features nine lines from ‘The Seasons’ by poet James Thomson, revealing the painting’s meaning.

The rainbow is a symbol of hope, coming after a storm. 

The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year, but Constable continued to work on it until 1834.

It has been seen to represent his turbulent frame of mind following the death of Maria.

Born in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists.

He is most known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up.

His most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the National Gallery.

Constable was not financially successful, and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52.

He died in march 1837 of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife. His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.
