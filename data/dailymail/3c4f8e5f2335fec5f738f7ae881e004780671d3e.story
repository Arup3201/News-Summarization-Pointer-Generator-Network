Italy manager Cesare Prandelli began the pre-World Cup war of words by claiming he wouldn't pick any of the England squad if they were Italian. 

Prandelli, 56, praised Roy Hodgson but insisted that his squad is stronger, and also hinted that he may want to manage in England when he leaves his job with the Azzurri.

The former Fiorentina boss told Fox Sports that he was confident in his own team, despite the England boss unearthing new talent over the last year.

'They are a very, very strong team. Hodgson has found some very interesting players. In particular when you consider them from a physical perspective. They are very technical and resistant.

'Which players would I take from the English? They have some interesting young players. Until around a year ago no one thought they would be able to make an impression in the Premier League.

'But I wouldn’t take anyone to have instead of my own players. We are a good team too.'

The Italian boss, whose side kick off their World Cup campaign against England in Manaus on June 14, said he had thought about working in England after the World Cup.

'Going abroad fascinates everyone. Every time I talk to one of my colleagues who is working abroad, they have a smile on their face that I have forgotten about a little bit!

'They always say that abroad you have the chance to have a private life but at the same time you can still do the job you love.

'Maybe in Italy there is too much pressure. I also one day dream of having such an experience.

'The English League is very competitive and full of enthusiasm. It is watched by a lot of people and transmits a lot of emotions.'

In the aftermath of last week's Coppa Italia final, which was delayed after riots in Rome, Prandelli conceded that Italian football can learn from the English game in its fight against hooliganism.

'We should look to copy the English model. The most important things in our football should be the game and the fans.

'The best thing about the recent Coppa Italia final was that there were two good teams on the pitch who were playing good football.

'All the players that night showed a great sense of responsibility.'
