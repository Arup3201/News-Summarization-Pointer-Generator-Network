Early reports by sites such as Ars Technica hint that Apple will unveil a textbook version of its Garageband music software - a 'book creation kit' that will make it easy for publishers, or teachers, to add video, music and images to text

Steve Jobs described textbooks as an '$8 billion a year industry ripe for digital destruction', in conversations with his biographer Walter Isaacson.

Apple looks set to unveil the weaponry it will use later this week, in a New York 'special event' that will have an education theme.

Early reports by sites such as Ars Technica hint that Apple will unveil a textbook version of its Garageband music software - a 'book creation kit' that will make it easy for publishers, or teachers, to add video, music and images to text.

Jobs himself had reportedly been in conversation with major textbook publishers such as Pearson before his death - and insiders say that the new Apple textbook software might be built around blueprints created by Jobs himself.

Several textbook publishers are to attend the event this week.

Bill Goodwyn, head of Discovery Inc's education department, said that he had talked to Apple about new approaches to the textbook industry.

'Apple is a very disruptive force, and in education, that's a good thing,' he said.

Amazon already publishes many university-level textbooks via its Kindle eBook format - but many tech insiders say that Apple's ability to deliver textbooks mixed with video, pictures and music could be a critical advantage.

Ars Technica reports that a 'book creation kit' is the most likely product to be unveiled this week, as Apple doesn't usually tend to go into publishing, regardless of what industries it works with.

The site also claims that whatever plans are unveiled this Thursday, they could well be the brainchild of Apple founder Jobs himself.

'According to our sources close to his efforts, Jobs' personal involvement was perhaps more significant that even his biography purports,' says the site.

'Jobs worked on this project for several years, and our understanding is that the final outcome was slated to be announced in October 2011 in conjunction with the iPhone 4S. Those plans were postponed at the last minute, perhaps due to Jobs' imminent death.'
