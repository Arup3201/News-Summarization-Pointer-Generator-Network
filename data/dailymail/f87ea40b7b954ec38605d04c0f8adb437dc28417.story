Katie Hopkins might have made enemies on Celebrity Big Brother but it seems the outspoken star is intent on making a few more after branding Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton 'chubby' during a TV appearance.

Now the 32-year-old singer has hit back, describing Hopkins' words as 'harmful' and saying the reality star is likely to leave a 'toxic and negative' legacy.

Hamilton was left fuming after 40-year-old Hopkins' appearance on The Wright Stuff - in particular because she gave birth to her fourth child just five months ago.

Writing in a post on her BabyCentre blog, Hamilton explained that she has focused on looking after her health since the birth and reacted with 'complete horror' when she heard Hopkins' remark.

New mother Natasha Hamilton, who is a size 8 and gave birth five moths ago, has hit back at outspoken Katie Hopkins after she called girlgroup Atomic Kitten, of which Natasha is a member, 'chubby' on national TV

The star, who found fame singing with Liz McClarnon and Kerry Katona in Atomic Kitten, also said that such remarks increase the pressure on women.

'It is pressure from women like Katie Hopkins - who talk utter nonsense and define people by their looks and weight - who are responsible for this pressure,' she fumed.

Hamilton, who says her weight has been scrutinised since she was 20, continued by saying she's now old enough and confident enough  to brush Hopkins' 'idiotic comments' aside.

'If she feels it’s justified to call me “chubby”,' she continued, 'despite the fact I’m a new mum and a size 8, the woman is clearly very harmful and the less exposure she gets the better.'

Unfortunately, added the Atomic Kitten star, not every woman is so confident. 'The sad reality is, there’ll be other women, especially new mums, who will feel under pressure by her comments.' 

Hamilton also used her post to discuss her struggle with post-natal depression, sparked by the birth of her first child Josh in 2002. 

'My weight plummeted dramatically,' she remembers, 'and I found it increasingly difficult to leave the house and go to work.

'I knew there’d be another weight related story that would be criticise me further.'

Twelve years on and Hamilton says she has learned to love herself and is teaching her children to love others whatever their shape or size.

 'I think Katie Hopkins’ fixation on berating people’s looks masks her own insecurities,' she concludes.

'What’s worse is that she is a mother. Does she really believe her own children will be impervious to cruel jibes and insults - what a shame that her legacy will be so toxic and negative.'

The spat came shortly after Hamilton showed off her incredible post-baby body during a performance with her Atomic Kitten bandmates at G-A-Y in London on Saturday night.

The 32-year-old singer donned a daring PVC cut-out jumpsuit for the performance, which revealed a leather bra and matching pants.

The girls were taking to the stage exactly 14 years to the day after they played their first G-A-Y gig.
