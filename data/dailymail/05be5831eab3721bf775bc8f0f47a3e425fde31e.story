A British man suspected of being the first UK citizen to die of Ebola did not have the deadly virus, officials have confirmed today.

Colin Jaffray, 58, from Royston, Hertfordshire, was struck down with a fever, vomiting and internal bleeding during a business trip to Macedonia - and died in hospital on Thursday evening.

Officials in Skopje say that although the cause of death was not known, it is thought that a drinking binge may have played a part in his death.

Colin Jaffray, a Briton who died after showing symptoms of Ebola in Macedonia did not have the virus, it has been confirmed  

It was feared that Mr Jaffay, a married father-of-three had contracted the infection after showing symptoms of the condition, even though he had not travelled to an Ebola infected country in West Africa.

However officials in the capital Skopje confirmed today that they have ruled out the infection as a cause of death.

Dr Jovanka Kostovska, Macedonia's head of infection control said: 'We have just received the results from the lab in Hamburg and they are negative for Ebola, which means that the patient did not have the Ebola virus.'

A senior health official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that authorities had 'serious indications' that the man had consumed large amounts of alcohol.

'So the theory that this might be the cause of death is very much in play,' he said. 

Mr Jaffay had travelled to the Balkan country with Mike English, who claimed that the 58-year-old had been 'shaking' and 'confused' in the hours before his death but had refused to see a doctor. 

He said: 'For two days he was saying he didn't feel good. He had fever but refused to go to the doctor.

'That morning he said he felt better. We agreed to meet downstairs at the hotel at noon. He called and said he didn't feel good, his hands were shaking. He was confused. The hotel staff then called for an ambulance'.

Mr Jaffay had stayed in his hotel room for three days with severe stomach ache but was rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon but died within 90 minutes.

But speaking from his hotel room yesterday Mr English, 72, denied his friend had an alcohol problem.

'The suggestion that he was an alcoholic was certainly not true. He did not drink more than anyone else,' he said. 

He said that Mr Jaffray was a married father of three from Cambridge, and said that he had visited Africa six years ago.

Yesterday Mr English's wife Olga told MailOnline at their home in Bedfordshire Mr Jaffray was 'healthy and jokey' the night before he left the country nine days ago.

She said: 'I don't know what kind of bug Colin got but it's not Ebola, I'm sure of that.' 

She added that  Mr Jaffray had suffered an 'illness related to the nervous system' for years and had always 'refused to go to his GP'. 

She claimed he would often shake and had been admitted to hospital in Macedonia a number of times before during business trips to Skopje. 

She said: 'Colin doesn't have an alcohol problem. He had a drink every now and then but no more than anybody else. 

'He had a long term health problem but he never went to the doctors. Everyone was saying he should have gone to the doctors but he wouldn't listen. 

'It wasn't viral, he had it for a long time, a number of years. Everybody knew he had it and everybody told him to go to the doctors but he never did. 

'Every time he went to Macedonia it would be something. He would fall down or it would be something else. It was related to something more serious that's wrong with him that nobody knows about.

'I think that's what has happened not ebola. Its not viral, its something to do with his nervous system like Parkinsons, he shakes a lot. 

'They are expecting the test results tomorrow then I don't know when [Mr English] will be home. Hopefully straight away. 

'Apparently Colin passed on a meeting because he wasn't feeling very well, Michael went to it by himself then when he came back to the hotel Colin had been taken to hospital. 

'Its very sad. He was a really nice man and very intelligent. I think he went to Cambridge University.'

The authorities believe Mr Jaffray had travelled to Skopje directly from Britain and had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks

The UK Foreign Office said it has been investigating the incident. So far the epidemic, the worst on record since Ebola was discovered in 1976, has claimed 4,00 lives and infected at least 8,000 people.

Public Health England has said it believed it was 'unlikely' that the death was caused by the virus but investigations were continuing.

Dr Brian McCloskey, of Public Health England, said: 'Public Health England is aware there are unconfirmed reports of a British national dying in Macedonia, who may have exhibited some symptoms compatible with Ebola.

'We understand Ebola to be unlikely as the cause of death but will continue to work with partners to investigate.' 

The unnamed man will be the first British victim of the Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands in West Africa and has spread to North America and Europe, if reports are confirmed

Yesterday Macedonian TV station Alfa TV reported the patient was admitted to an infection clinic in the city with symptoms of the disease.

When admitted to the hospital, the patient was unable to communicate and passed away shortly after.A spokesman from the Macedonian foreign ministry said: 'I can confirm that a British person has died and he is in the state hospital in Skopje.

'We are looking to see what are the reasons according to the protocols of the World Health Organization.

'There was a friend with him and he has also been retained in the hospital and the crew from the ambulance are also retained in the hospital.'  

A Health Ministry official said the man had arrived in Skopje from Britain a week ago and had been rushed to hospital at 3pm on Thursday, where he died several hours later.

Dr. Jovanka Kostovska of the ministry's commission for infectious diseases said the man had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding, and that his condition deteriorated rapidly.

'These are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,' Kostovska told a news conference, adding that samples had been sent to Germany for tests to confirm the cause of death.

Staff of the hotel where the two Britons stayed had also been quarantined, as had the ambulance team and medical staff that treated the deceased.  

The only British citizen to have been infected with Ebola was nurse Will Pooley who survived despite catching the virus while working to help victims in Sierra Leone.

Earlier this month the 29-year-old told an international summit  the world must avoid 'at all cost' the 'horror and misery' of watching young children die from the disease in horrific, squalid conditions.

Mr Pooley, from Suffolk,  returned from a life-saving mission to the U.S. where he gave blood to try and help another victim of the virus, a friend he worked with in Sierra Leone helping victims.

The British government have ordered airports to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK, just hours after ministers said it would do little to curb the spread of the deadly virus.

But experts told MailOnline 'shutting borders will not stop Ebola', as leading experts say the key to tackling the vicious virus is 'rooting it out' at the source, in West Africa. 

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Shutting borders will not stop Ebola, you have to root it out.'

He added: 'The longer this goes on the more likely it is we may see a case in the UK.

'But the UK deals with things like this effectively, they (the authorities) handle it.

'They are ready enough and have the capacity. There are a lot of doctors and nurses here who have been out there (to West Africa) with Doctors Without Borders, and so who have Ebola experience, which is invaluable.'

Meanwhile Professor Robert Dingwall, a specialist in health policy responses to infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University accused the US of 'gesture politics', by introducing temperature screening at five airports.

He told MailOnline: 'Controls are costly to enforce, inconvenience people and disrupt economic activity while having little or no impact on the spread of infections.'

'We have to work now so that it is not the world's next AIDS,' said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, pictured

Experts say the most effective method of tackling the outbreak is to direct resources and funds to fighting the disease in West Africa, welcoming news the UK has vowed to deploy 750 soldiers and a medical warship to Sierra Leone.

A U.S. health chief has warned the outbreak could become the 'next Aids', unless drastic action is taken to halt the crisis.

'We have to work now so that it is not the world's next AIDS,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden told the heads of the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund gathered in Washington.

'I would say that in the 30 years I've been working in public health, the only thing like this has been AIDS,' he added, warning of a 'long fight' ahead.
