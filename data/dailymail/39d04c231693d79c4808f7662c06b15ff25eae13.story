A peckish undertaker has been caught on camera apparently trying to drive his hearse to a drive-through branch of fast food chain KFC.

The funeral vehicle, complete with a clearly-visible coffin in the back, was spotted attempting to drive under a barrier to reach the order window of the restaurant.

However, an onlooker said that the hearsewas too large to fit under the red and white frame, so the unknown driver reversed and instead headed to a neighbouring branch of coffee chain Starbucks.

Twitter user Craig Davies said he saw the hearse trying to get into the restaurant in Cardiff, Wales, and posted a snap of the car with the caption,  ‘#itswhathewouldhavewanted’.

He wrote: 'I couldn't believe it. It was too wide for 
the posts so they parked up and went into Starbucks instead!'

Although some Twitter users questioned whether the photograph was real, Mr Davies, who said he saw the hearse at the Cardiff Gate branch, has maintained it is genuine.
