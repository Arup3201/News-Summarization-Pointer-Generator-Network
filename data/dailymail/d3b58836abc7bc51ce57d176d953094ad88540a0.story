They came from around the world to pay their respects to one of surfing's most legendary figures.

Hundreds of surfers yesterday gathered in Huntington Beach, California, in an extraordinary 'paddle out' tribute to the late wave forecaster Sean Collins.

Collins, 59, collapsed while playing tennis on December 26 in Newport Beach. He was declared dead in hospital a short time later.

His widow Daren yesterday looked on with pride as some of his most loyal followers formed a giant circle with their surfboards.

So total was Collins' influence that it is easy to forget there was once a time when surfers spent 
much of their time on 'surfin' safari' journeys in an 
aimless search for waves.

Collins changed all that. His
telephone Surfline reports, based on observations from a stable of 
seasoned wave riders up and down the California coast, evolved with 
technology into an online worldwide report on surf spots.

The forecaster was inducted into the Huntington Beach Surfers' Hall of Fame in 
2008.

At the ceremony, he wrote the words 'Follow Your Passions' in concrete at the 
shrine on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street.

He said: 'The
personal pay-off is the lifestyle of continuing to be able to chase 
great surf around the world while getting paid for it, and I couldn't do
that without my great team of people.'

Peter
Townend, surfing's first world champion, remembers Collins coming to a 
meeting at Surfing Magazine and explaining this new phone service.

He said: 'We
were all going, "We don't know if that will ever work,"' he recalled. 
'And now look at us. It's the number one communication to our world.

'We've all ridden more waves because of Sean Collins. It's that simple.'

Collins
began surfing in Seal Beach when he was eight years old. He started weather 
tracking while spending hours at sea with his father on a 50ft 
sailboat. He had no formal training, just a few meteorology courses at 
Long Beach Community College and a passion.

Surfline's
telephone service began in the 1980s. From the everyday surfer looking 
for waves before work to surf contest organisers, the service became 
crucial for modern wave riders.

He personally sent out alerts to 
lifeguards and news agencies when big waves were on the way.

'People tell us we can't do it, and we're going to try that much harder,' Collins said in his Hall of Fame induction speech.

He set up the first live 'surfcam' in 1996.

Collins,
who lived in Seal Beach, was named one of the 25 Most Influential 
Surfers of the Century by Surfer Magazine in 1999 and the eighth Most 
Powerful Surfer in the Surf Industry by Surfer Magazine in 2002.

He sold Surfline in 2000, but stayed on as president and chief forecaster.

Collins is survived by his wife Daren and sons AJ and Tyler.
