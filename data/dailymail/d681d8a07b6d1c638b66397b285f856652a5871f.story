A grandmother has spoken of how she feels as if she is constantly seasick after she was diagnosed with a rare condition following a cruise.

Diane Morley, 63 said she feels as if she is dizzy and swaying all of the time and has trouble doing everyday tasks.

The mother-of-one was diagnosed with the rare condition Mal de Debarquement Syndrome a few months after a Norwegian cruise holiday with her husband Dennis with firm Fred Olsen.

Mrs Morley, of Herne Bay, Kent, told MailOnline she believes the condition, which is thought to be incurable, was triggered by one particularly choppy night aboard the Black Watch cruise ship in September 2012.

She said: 'We had a fantastic time. There was one bad night when we went out to the North Sea and it was a bit choppy.

'It was like sleeping in a washing machine that night, but the following day was absolutely fine.

'I was absolutely fine but then we came back to Norway seven days later.

'I got off the boat and again I was fine but two days after that I started to get this feeling of dizziness and swaying.

'It feels like you're walking on a trampoline and your feet are like sponge.'

Mrs
 Morley went to the doctors after returning home and was referred to the
 Ear, Nose and Throat specialist at Canterbury, who diagnosed Mal De 
Debarquement Syndrome.

She said: 'It is where the brain has locked in to try and get me to rebalance.'

Mrs Morley said although she does not drink alcohol or coffee, her condition has at times left others believing she was drunk.

She said she once had to leave an event at a holiday camp after the bright lights and music affected her condition.

She said she told a man as she was leaving that she had problems with her balance.

She said: 'I don't drink but he thought I looked drunk.'

Mrs Morley, who is now a member of the MdDS Foundation, said she believed the rough night at sea on the cruise has contributed to the condition, although there has been no way of confirming this.

She said: 'The feeling you get is like I'm aboard and I'm trying to get my balance.

'I'm swaying all the time and trying to get my balance normal.'

Mrs Morley said the condition is believed to be incurable, although she does use valium to help relieve the symptoms.

Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, or 'disembarkment syndrome', is a rare condition which causes a persistent sensation of motion, often described as swaying or difficulty maintaining balance.

According to the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation, the condition often develops after an ocean cruise or other type of travel on water.

It has however also been reported following air, train and road travel.

The symptoms of motion can also be associated with anxiety, fatigue and difficulty maintaining balance.

It is believed to be a neurological syndrome with no known cause or cure.

There have been reports however of the symptoms actually improving when the sufferer is travelling in a car, train, plane or boat.

Research into the condition is taking place through imaging studies.
