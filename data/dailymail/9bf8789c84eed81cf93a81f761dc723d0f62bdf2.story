87th minute: QPR 1-1 LIV (Vargas)

90th minute: QPR 1-2 LIV (Coutinho)

92nd minute: QPR 2-2 LIV (Vargas)

95th minute: QPR 2-3 LIV (Caulker OG) 

Liverpool took all three points after an incredible four goals were scored between the 87th minute and full time.

Queens Park Rangers twice equalised in the 87th and 92nd minute through substitute Eduardo Vargas, but Steven Caulker's own goal in the 95th minute meant the game finished 3-2 to Liverpool.

That came after Richard Dunne opened the scoring with an own goal in the 67th minute with substitute Philippe Coutinho getting the other goal for Brendan Rodgers' side in the 90th minute.

Here, Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives you his verdict on how the players performed. 

QUEENS PARK RANGERS (4-4-2)

Alex McCarthy - 7

Handed his first Premier league start in place of Rob Green and unlucky to be on losing side. 

Nedum Onuoha - 6.5

Lasted just 45 minutes after sustaining a hamstring injury. Was solid enough until then.

Richard Dunne - 6.5 

Chosen ahead of Rio Ferdinand and justified his manager's decision until his unlucky own goal.

Steven Caulker - 6.5 

Looks to have established himself as the club's first-choice central defender. Looked comfortable for the most part. Unlucky with his own goal.

Suk-Young Yun - 6 

Making his first appearance of the season and handed the task of dealing with Sterling. He couldn't cope with him in the second half.

Mauricio Isla - 6.5 

Energetic down the right-hand side and showed some decent delivery from out wide.

Sandro - 7 

Will be a big player for QPR this season and showed why  with an excellent display before limping off.

Karl Henry - 7 

His experience was key in central midfielder. Kept things ticking over for QPR in a congested midfield.

Leroy Fer - 6.5 

Started brightly but should have scored with a simple chance in the first half. Misses proved costly.

Bobby Zamora - 7 

Rolled back the years, especially in the first-half, with a terrific display of centre-forward play.

Charlie Austin - 7

Looked bang up for it from the outset and worked Liverpool's two central defenders. Key role in the leveller.

Substitutes

Matt Phillips - 6

Showed bags of energy after his introduction at half-time.

Armand Traore - 6

Took too long to get to grips with the pace of the game.

Eduardo Vargas - 8

Thrown on in an attempt to salvage something from the game and delivered.

LIVERPOOL (4-3-2-1) 

Simon Mignolet - 6.5

Looks far from convincing when dealing with crosses - but his shot-stopping saved Liverpool.

Glen Johnson - 6.5

His future is in doubt but showed great energy for the Merseysiders down the right-hand side and played key role in opener.

Martin Skrtel - 6

Given a torrid time by Zamora all afternoon and didn't look comfortable at Loftus Road.

Dejan Lovren - 5.5

Not his most convincing 90 minutes. Showed a lack of composure and also struggled against Zamora.

Jose Enrique - 6

Looked solid at left-back and  displayed cool distribution with the ball for the visitors.

Jordan Henderson - 7.5

A vital component for club and country now. Argument to stay he's now overtaken Gerrard as the club's premier central midfielder.

Steven Gerrard - 7

Started in an advanced role before dropping back to a deeper position. Kept things moving nicely.

Emre Can - 6.5

The game bypassed him a little bit, but showed enough quality to suggest he has a role to play this season. 

Raheem Sterling - 8.5

Tired? No chance. After a quiet first-half was back to his excellent best in the second. Won the game for his team.

Adam Lallana - 7

Always seems to choose the right option with ball at his feet. Unlucky to be substituted in the second half.

Mario Balotelli - 6

Showed flashes of brilliance, but lacked composure in the final third, much to his team-mates' annoyance at times.

Substitutes

Philippe Coutinho - 7

Came on and Liverpool immediately perked up. Brilliant footballer and great goal.

Joe Allen - 6.5

Added passing prowess to Liverpool's midfield. The visitor's looked more balanced after his introduction.

Kolo Toure - 6

Shored things up for the final seconds.
