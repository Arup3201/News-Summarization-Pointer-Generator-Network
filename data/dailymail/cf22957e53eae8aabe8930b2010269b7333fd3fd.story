With the average price of a home in London now above £500,000, it may come as a surprise to learn a studio flat has just been put on the market for less than £100,000.

What is perhaps less surprising is that it measures just 206 square feet - including entrance and separate bathroom - requires a ladder to get into bed, and has only a microwave in the 'kitchen'.

Described as a 'bijou studio flat... with an open plan kitchen area' on the listing, the sellers admit that it could do with 'updating in parts'.

'Bijou': Estate agents described this studio flat in Steatham as 'open plan' but in need of 'updating in places'

Bargain: The new owner will pay just £99,950 for the studio apartment, but will need a ladder to get into bed and will have to use a microwave for all their cooking

However, with other studio flats in the same area selling for up to £235,000, estate agents Jacksons are hoping potential buyers will see it as a bargain. 

Across the other side of London in Mayfair, a 334 sqft flat was recently put up for sale for £1million, making it the smallest million-pound property on the market.

Meanwhile, in nearby Kensignton and Knightsbridge, off-street car parking spaces often sell for in excess of £100,000, with some currently on the market for £225,000.

The most expensive flat sold in Britain is also in Knightsbridge. Penthouse D at the top of 1 Hyde Park sold earlier this year for a reported £140million, despite having no furnishings or internal walls. 

In Steatham itself, the average cost of a house is now £523,267, having shot up from a little over £400,000 in 2010. A flat in the same postcode is worth an average of more than £300,000.

Prime location: The studio is above a shop, and just a few minutes' walk away from Steatham railway station

Experts have cautioned in recent months that the property market has been slowing down, with a report out today showing that mortgage lending in August fell for the first time in six months.

A report published earlier today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a majority of areas in London are seeing property price falls for the first time in nearly four years after a dramatic slide in the number of new house hunters in the capital.

And on Wednesday, lender Halifax forecast the property market would cool saying it believed house price inflation had peaked, despite homes rising another £1,100 in September. 

Cheap: At 206 square feet, the flat is only slightly smaller than another one-bed property put on the market in Mayfair, although that one was listed for £1million
