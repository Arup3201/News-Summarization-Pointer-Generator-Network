Credit Suisse - the second largest bank in Switzerland with offices all over the world - is suing a hedge fund manager they mistakenly wired $1.5 million to, after the Florida man seemingly vanished within weeks of receiving the money.

The Zurich-based bank claims in lawsuit papers filed in New York that the money was wired to Joseph B. Galbraith on January 13 via his hedge fund, Galbraith Capital Investment Management.

However two weeks later, Credit Suisse realized Galbraith's company was 'winding down operations and it had no cash left in its account with Credit Suisse', according to The New York Times.

Galbraith, who chose to renounce his US citizenship in 2011 after a messy divorce, said in email to Credit Suisse on February 5 he was 'dealing with his' and not to panic, however he hasn't been heard from since.

Mistaken: Credit Suisse - the second largest bank in Switzerland with offices all over the world, including New York (pictured)  - wired a total of $1.5 million  to a U.S. hedge fund manager in three transactions in January this year, however later realized it was a mistake. The hedge fund manger, Joseph B. Galbraith, then vanished

The Times reported that Galbraith is presumed to be living in Europe with his second wife, who was born in Brazil.

Credit Suisse contacted Galbraith's bank, the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, however they were informed Galbrraith had refused to give permission to reverse the transaction.

Royal Bank of Canada said there was nothing more they could do.

In the lawsuit filed by Credit Suisse, they claim Galbraith misled them and never intended to give the money back.

Credit Suisse sued the fund and the manager.

At a hearing in New York in August, the judge granted a judgment against the fund, but not against Galbraith.

Galbraith has not been served, because his whereabouts remains unknown.

However a Times reporter managed to contact him via email.

'Mr. Galbraith said he had not been aware of the Credit Suisse lawsuit,' the newspaper reported.

'In an email, he said the accusations against him were ''ridiculous, bordering on laughable'' and part of an effort to malign and slander his character.'

It's presumed the emails cannot be traced. 

Galbraith is also reportedly in legal dispute with a computer technology company, who claim he owes them $130,000 in outstanding fees.

Additionally, Monaco’s financial regulator posted a warning about Galbraith Capital, who’s people were, they said, cold-calling customers.

Gailbraith's hedge fund was based in Safety Harbor, Florida, and once had $120 million under its management.

During his 2011 divorce proceedings, his assets were listed as $5.7 million.

However in the last few years, the capital of Galbraith Capital Investment Management had been flagging, The Times reported, and Galbraith started returning money to investors.
