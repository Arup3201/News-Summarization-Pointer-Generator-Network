Gone with the Wind remains one of the most beloved films of all time, due to the unforgettable love-triangle story of Southern Belle Scarlett O'Hara, her neighbor Ashley Wilkes and eventual husband Rhett Butler.

But there's another character of the film that has fallen by the wayside over the last 75 years - 'Tara' the stately O'Hara family plantation home that serves as the backdrop of the Civil War-era movie.

While the movie-set facade for Tara remained on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer back lot for several years, it eventually was purchased and shipped to Georgia where it remained all but forgotten for three decades as the pieces wore into disrepair.

Hollywood history: Tara is the fictional home of the O'Hara family in classic film Gone with the Wind. Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, pictured outside the facade for the house in the movie

Claim to fame: The set for Gone with the Wind was used as a backdrop for Western movies until it was dismantled in 1960

Now, local historian Peter Bonner is working to display the set pieces in hopes of teaching tourists about the parallels between Gone with the Wind and author Margaret Mitchell's real-life experiences growing up in the South during Reconstruction.

The shell of the home was built at MGM's Selznick Studios, and was used for several years as a backdrop for other Western movies filmed there.

The set was dismantled in 1960, though the studio continued to mislead tourists for several years into thinking another southern mansion on 'back lot 2' was the frame used in the famous film.

Tara was first purchased by group Southern Attractions, inc in 1959 who had plans to turn the set into a museum and tourist attraction.

The group was unsuccessful however, due to Gone with the Wind author Margaret Mitchell's refusal to license anything that would capitalize off the novel.

Eventually the pieces were purchased in 1979 by Betty Talmadge, the ex-wife of former Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge and daughter-in-law to one of the state's former governors.

Resting place: Betty Talmadge, the ex-wife of a former Georgia senator, purchased Tara in 1979 and ever since they've been stored in an old dairy barn on her property

The show must go on: Mrs Talmadge passed away in 2005, but historian Bonner has continued to work to restore the pieces she left behind

Mrs Talmadge had the door of the set restored and lent for permanent display at the Margaret Mitchell house and museum ten years later, where it remains today.

The rest of the facade - including windows, shutters, cornice, steps, and a breezeway - still sits in an old dairy barn in Mrs Talmadge's backyard, though she passed away in 2005. Mrs Talmadge's home in Lovejoy, Georgia was just down the road from Lovejoy Plantation, which is rumored to be the inspiration for character Ashley Wilkes' family plantation in the book.

Before her death, Mrs Talmadge befriended local historian Bonner who started to help restoring the pieces.

His ultimate goal is to turn Tara into a museum, though he told MailOnline he doesn't plan on rebuilding the house as it was used on set.

New life: Bonner doesn't plan to rebuild the home, but instead is working to showcase the pieces with wooden supports. Above, some of Tara's signature olive-green shutters

Showing off: Bonner currently gives tours 3-4 times a month for groups of about 15 who are interested in the set

Attraction: Bonner hopes to ultimately restore the pieces so that they can be showcased for years to come

Since the pieces have been stored in poor condition for decades, he is instead working to showcase them like set pieces on a stage, with wooden supports.

Now that some of that work is done, Bonner has been receiving a flood of interest in the set and conducts about three to four tours a month for groups of 15-20 people. Bonner says the tourists come from all over the U.S. as well as Italy, France, Germany and other foreign countries.

He also recently finished writing a small book on the set, titled The Official Guide to the 'Saving Tara' project', which he has already sent to press.

While he sees himself retiring from the tourism business in a few years, Bonner hopes to restore the set pieces enough that they can continue to be showcased for years to come.
