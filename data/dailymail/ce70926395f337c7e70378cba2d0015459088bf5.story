It's common for students to pile on the pounds while at university.

But sport and physical education graduate Sophie Tucker was left feeling bloated and unattractive after she ballooned to a size 16 while studying.

Three years of heavy partying and a diet of late-night kebabs and pizzas had caused the 23-year-old's weight to rise to 12st 5lb - despite her fitness degree.

Sophie (left) says the pictures taken of her on her graduation day were the motivation for her weight loss 

She was also unable to exercise after injuring herself while playing rugby.

But it wasn't until Sophie, from Cardiff, Wales, saw how large she looked in her graduation photos that she was motivated to lose weight - shedding nearly four stone by changing her diet and introducing an exercise programme.

She swapped skipping breakfast for a healthy bowl of porridge, and snacked on fruit rice cakes and protein brownies, instead of crisps, chocolate bars and fast food.

Sophie also tucked into scrambled eggs with spinach for lunch - ditching the pasta bakes and shop-bought sandwiches she relied on at university - and ate chicken and fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables for dinner, instead of pasta or junk food.

Sophie said: 'I remember being really unhappy and embarrassed about my weight in my final year of university.

'After three years of heavy drinking and eating fast food, I managed to pile on stones after injuring myself playing rugby.

'I became comfortable in my relationship and I was really lazy with my cooking but I think after seeing my photographs from my graduation this was a massive wake up call for me.

'My dress was a size 16 and I was ashamed of the photographs.'

Breakfast: Typically would skip breakfast

Lunch: Pasta Bake, Shop bought wraps or sandwiches

Dinner: Pasta or Fast Food

Snacks: Crisps, Chocolate Bars and Fast Food

Breakfast: Protein porridge

Lunch: Scrambled eggs with spinach

Dinner: Chicken or fish with rice or sweet potato and vegetables

Snacks: Quest bars, fruit rice cakes, protein brownies

Like many students at the start of university, Sophie's social life involved plenty of calorie-laden alcohol and, away from the watchful eye of parents, her diet became unhealthy.

She also found she was eating more junk food after going for nights out drinking.

Sophie added: 'Initially the graduation photos worked wonders to motivate me.

'I would refuse to go clothes shopping as nothing looked good on me anymore and through constantly moaning about my weight and how unhappy I was, I was recommended by a friend to the LDN Muscle Bikini Guide.' 

Fed up, Sophie swapped her 'lazy' lifestyle for going to the gym with help from LDN Muscle.

On its website, the weight training programme says it aims to promote a 'natural, lean and aesthetic physique'.

Doing a mix of exercises, Sophie also began learning about nutrition and tailored her meals to suit her exercise regime, managing to lose 3st 7lb, reaching 9st 7lb and shrinking down to a size eight.

The dramatic change in lifestyle resulted in Sophie quickly losing the pounds and she is currently completing her one-year teacher training qualification at the University of Swansea.

'I was drawn in to buying the guide after being so impressed with the transformations,' she said.

'And I am so glad I took the plunge.

'LDN Muscle have taught me so much about nutrition which I had no idea about before.

'I finally enjoyed going to the gym and didn't feel as though it was a chore and I haven't looked back since.'
