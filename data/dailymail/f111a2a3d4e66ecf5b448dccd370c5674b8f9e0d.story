We've all sighed over the wardrobes of stylish celebrities, wishing we could get our hands on Daisy Lowe's gorgeous Gucci bag, or Fearne Cotton's cute, vintage-style dresses.

Well, sigh no more. Now you can. Plum pieces from the closets of the most fashionable stars around are being sold off at knock-down prices at a huge jumble sale - so if your elbows are sharp enough, you could end up with a designer wardrobe at charity shop prices.

Rumble in 
the Jumble, an event run in association with Oxfam, is taking place next
 weekend and you could be in with the chance of finding one of Gizzi Erskine's retro dresses, Zane Lowe's jackets or Disclosure's Nike Air 
Max on sale there.

It's back! Rumble in the jumble, a charity event organised with Oxfam and The Music Circle, is back this year - and could you snap up some designer goodies

After a hugely successful celebrity sale in 2013, which raised over £16,000, Caroline Flack, Gemma Cairney and The Music Circle are organising the event once more - and hoping to smash last year's target.

Speaking about the event, which will sell Annie Lennox's hand-written lyrics of Sweet Dreams and shoes worn by Shirley Manson in Garbage’s video, organiser and Radio 1 presenter Gemma Cairney told MailOnline: 'It is a huge, colourful, brilliant beast of an event. There will be a real mish-mash of celebrity offerings and the general public's clothes, it's like a high-end jumble sale.

'It is an authentic slap-dash event with no airs or graces, just grab what you can! There will be a DJ playing, photobooth, a man stand with a barber and Jamie Oliver has cooked up a 1,000-person stew to sell.'

Smashbox Cosmetics and Bumble and Bumble also will be offering a menu of beauty treatments and the world's most successful male model - that's David Gandy - will be donating his suit to the sale.

Now that's a designer dress! The clothes, which are going on sale thanks to Gemma Cairney (right), will be fitted with labels telling you exactly which celebrity they belonged to

The event is run in association with Oxfam and is raising money and awareness for women in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The are victims of 'the world's most forgotten conflict', who face constant threats of forced displacement, sexual violence, abduction and extortion.

Gemma said of the cause, which is close to her heart: 'I have a close connection with Oxfam and wanted to make some noise about this and help hold an event on a bigger scale. It is really good fun and a huge contrast to the deep roots of the cause.'

Gemma, who is currently hosting the Radio 1 warm-up show for Nick Grimshaw, said she has put her partying days behind her to focus on her work and charity projects.

'Grimmy parties a lot but he is very good at just popping out for half an hour. I want to put my energy into my projects not partying.

'I have been working on lots of documentaries and will be cycling to Paris for charity soon, I'll also be working at Glastonbury, which is my favourite time of the year.

'I just can't say no to projects but this is the happiest I've been in a long time,' she said.

Rumble In the Jumble takes place at Oval Space, 29-32 The Oval, London E2 9DT, on Sat April 26th. 12 noon - 6pm. 

Entry £3 + bring a bag of jumble to hand in at the door.

As part of the inaugural Fashion Revolution Day, Thursday 24 April 2014, the celebrities have joined forces with people in more than 50 countries around the world for one day to raise awareness of the fashion industry's most pressing issues and show that change is possible.

Fashion Revolution Day marks the first anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Dhaka, Bangladesh which killed 1134 people, and injured many more, when the factory complex collapsed. Today, people are still suffering as a direct result of the global fashion supply chain.
