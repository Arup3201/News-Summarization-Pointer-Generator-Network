Without a trace: Erica Lynn Parsons, 15, was reported missing by her 19-year-old brother last week after she was last seen in Salisbury, North Carolina, in November 2011

Police in North Carolina say the adoptive parents of a 15-year-old girl missing since 2011 did not report her disappearance for two years - and now they are refusing to cooperate with the investigation.

Erica Lynn Parsons was reported missing by her 19-year-old brother last week after she was last seen leaving the Salisbury home of her parents in November 2011.

An attorney hired by Erica's adoptive parents, Casey and Sandy Parsons, claimed that his clients were under the impression that the 15-year-old went to live with her biological mother and wanted to be left alone, the Charlotte Observer reported.

The lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that two years ago, a person claiming to be a relative or friend of Erica's birth parents came by Parsonses' home on Miller Chapel Road to pick her up and take her to her family.

The adoptive parents said they did not raise an alarm at the time because Erica visited that person in Asheville on several occasions.

According to Sherrill, In February 2012, Erica called the Parsonses and informed them in no uncertain terms that she was not coming back because she did not want to live with them anymore, Asheville Citizen-Times reported.

‘They looked at it as being a rebellious teenager. That was an attitude they took,’ Sherrill said. ‘I don't know that at any time it dawned on them she was a missing person.’

According to police investigating the case, when they questioned Casey and Sandy Parsons over a two-day period last week, the parents lied to them and were uncooperative.

Their attorney, however, insists that his clients did not purposefully fabricate anything, but were rather relying information that they believed to be true.

Sherrill added that her clients stopped answering questions when detectives began insinuating that that the Parsonses may have played a role in their adopted daughters' disappearance.

The lawyer told ABCNews.com that around November 2011, Case and Sandy Parsons got a call from Erica's birth mother, who said she wanted her daughter to come stay with her and another relative in the Asheville area for a while.  

Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011. On July 30, nearly two years later, her older brother, James Parsons, reported her missing.

He told authorities that when he asked about his sister previously, his parents said she had left and moved in with other relatives, the Salisbury Post said.

Worst fears: The girl's adoptive grandparents, Janet and Steven Parsons, are afraid that something happened to Erica, and their son, Erica's father, and his wife are not telling them the truth

The 19-year-old said he fears that something may have happened to Erica and his parents are not telling him.

According to Sherrill, James Parsons called police after being forced to move out of his parents’ house as punishment for assaulting his family.

When the Parsonses, who adopted the girl when she was just 2 weeks old, tried to contact Erica's family in Asheville, they could not be found, suggesting that the names they were given were false, according to the attorney.

Erica's grandparents said they too have been asking the Parsonses about the girl's whereabouts, but the parents said the teen was visiting family.

‘I am so worried, I am so worried,’ the grandmother, Janet Parsons, told the station WSOC-TV.

Steve Parsons, the girl’s grandfather, said the 15-year-old could not have been reported missing by a school because she was home-schooled.

Erica Parsons is described as 4 feet 5 and weighing between 85 and 90lbs. She has brown hair and brown eyes and appears small for her age.
