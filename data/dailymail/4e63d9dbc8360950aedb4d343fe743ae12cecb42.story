The girlfriend of a man swept to his death while on holiday in Laos last year has been found dead in a hotel room.

Kate Downey, who turned 30 last month, was found dead in a Premier Inn in Newcastle on Saturday, four months after her partner, John-Paul Conley, drowned in a river on the island of Don Phon.

Archaeologist Miss Downey, from Middlesbrough, was found by police and paramedics days before a tribute evening to her 35-year-old boyfriend was due to be held in the couple's home town.

Police say they believe no-one else was involved in her death, and a post-mortem will be scheduled to identify the cause.

Miss Downey's brother, Lee Downey, wrote on an online tribute page: 'For those who knew them, Kate Downey and John-Paul Conley are now together forever.

'The pain and loss has proved too much for Kate to bear. Hope you have found your Shangri-La, having the next great adventure with Jonny. RIP our beautiful sister.'

A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: 'At 12.25pm on Saturday, police were informed of concern for a woman in a hotel room in the Premier Inn in Ponteland Road in Woolsington.

'Police and paramedics attended, and a woman in her 30s was pronounced dead at the scene.

'There is believed to be no third-party involvement and a report will be prepared for the coroner.'

The scheduled tribute night, John-Paul's Big Night Out, which was due to be held this Friday in Middlesbrough, has now been cancelled.

The memorial event, in aid of the RNLI and featuring local bands, was due to be held with the support of Mr Conley's family.

A message posted on the Facebook page for the event said: 'In light of the tragic news this weekend, Friday night will obviously not be going ahead at such a terrible time for both the families and the loved ones of Kate and John-Paul.

'Our thoughts and love are with them all.'

The couple had been travelling the world for a year when Mr Conley, a docker at Teesside Docks, was swept away by strong currents while swimming in the Don Khone river.  The couple had taken a year out from their jobs to travel and had only been in Laos a few days when the accident happened.

Mr Conley was missing for four days last November, during which time his family and friends raised more than £30,000 to fund boats and helicopters to search for him.

His body was later found swept up on a river beach and recovered by a fishing boat.

During the search, Miss Downey was described as 'amazingly strong' by her brother.

Several friends have paid tribute to Miss Downey online, with one person writing: 'Such another 
tragic loss for the families and friends of them both.

'Thoughts and 
prayers to you all and may they both now rest in peace together.'

Graeme Robertson, from Adelaide, south Australia, wrote: 'When two people are in love and do so many things together they have a few sad times but so, so many happy times.

'If they are parted through tragedy, the one left living can feel so much pain inside we all can’t see as tears will hide.

'If
 they feel that they can’t go on we can’t imagine the pain of their 
broken heart, only that they need to be together once again.'

Andrea Murphy-King, from Middlesbrough, wrote: RIP Kate. Reunited with John Paul, angels together forever. Michele sending you and both families soooo much love xx'

And Alex Callaby, from Middlesbrough, wrote: 'Truly devastating news I hope kate has found her peace with JP and their families find strength in each other so very sorry to hear this news thoughts prayers and love go out to all their family and friends. Xxx'
