A 44-year-old teacher had sexual relationships with multiple underage students, took them to nude beaches and sex clubs and demanded they have sex with others girls, prosecutors have said.

Sean Shaynak, a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School - one of New York City's most selective public schools - was indicted on 36 new counts involving six students on Tuesday.

It came after he was charged in August with using Snapchat to send a picture of his genitals to another 16-year-old student at the school, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante.

During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. 

'Sick': Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly had sex with multiple students at the school where he taught, sent them explicit messages and took them to nude beaches and sex clubs. He has pleaded not guilty

They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported.

'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported.

He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said.

Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim.

During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club.

He also had sex with another girl but she put up resistance when the sex went too far - but he forced himself on her anyway, prosecutors said, the Daily News reported.

Shaynak also allegedly sent photos of his genitals to four students, including two minors, and gave the teenagers alcohol and cigarettes. 

He also gave the girls top grades even though they did no work, the prosecutor said. 

On Tuesday, Shaynak's lawyer Kimberly Summers pleaded not guilty on his behalf. His bail was set at $1 million.

He pleaded not guilty last month to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor and harassment. He was arrested on Tuesday morning on these latest claims. 

Brooklyn Tech, where Shaynak worked for five years, is based in Fort Greene and is one of the city's most selective public schools.

Dante de Blasio attends the school, but students said he was not taught by Shaynak. 

Shaynak has a nine-year-old daughter. He and his wife are divorced and she lives upstate.
