Dozens of copies of the order of service from the reburial of Richard III have appeared for sale on eBay, with some retrieving bids of more than £255.

Church leaders have condemned online profiteers for attempting to sell the order of service booklets which were handed out at Leicester Cathedral during the reburial ceremony last Thursday.

One Service of Reinterment has already sold on the auction site for a whopping £255, plus £5.72 postage.

Some sellers have bundled together all three order of services from the cathedral's major ceremonies, including the Service of Reveal, the Service of Reinterment and the Service of Compline (pictured together)

Some booklets have even been bundled together into 'souvenir packs', which feature the order of services from the ceremony marking the coffins arrival, the reburial and the revealing of the tomb. 

These, which also come with a copy of a local newspaper, are fetching in the region of £200 plus an additional £2.50 postage. 

The Dean of Leicester, the Very Rev David Monteith, said it was 'sad' that people were trying to cash in on the extraordinary event.

He added that the cathedral is printing a full set of all three main service booklets, including March 22 when the king's coffin first arrived in Leicester, for just £12.50.

The Dean added that some of that money goes directly to the cathedral, which is still raising the £2.5million it needs to pay for hosting the historic week of events and overhauling the old building.

'We've noticed that service booklets from the cathedral's services are being sold for extortionate prices on eBay, presumably by those who attended the services,' he said.

Several sellers have bundled the reburial order of service in with official memorabilia from March 22, when the coffin arrived in Leicester, and from March 27 when the new tomb for his body was revealed to the public 

'This is very sad - many would have welcomed being there and keeping this as a souvenir.

'We have had extra copies printed and we are selling a set of all three for £12.50 to cover costs from Christian Resources in St Martin's House, next door to the cathedral.'

Cathedral bosses have been at great pains to ensure last week's reburial of the last Plantagenet king was a solemn occasion of 'dignity and honour'.

There are currently numerous listings of the order of service from the reburial, which is titled: 'Service of Reinterment of the remains of King Richard III by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland', for sale on eBay.

Others have already sold for more than £250, with one selling today – which featured all three order of service books - for a whopping £255 plus £5.72 postage.

Another sold for £199 plus £2.80 postage on Saturday, with another fetching £200 plus £2.99 postage yesterday.

The majority of sellers who have listed the items claim to be based in Leicestershire, suggesting they obtained the order of service at the ceremony before trying to make a quick profit online.

The church said other sellers had visited the cathedral in recent days to buy the souvenir pack before listing them for sale on eBay. 

The auction site said it allowed the sale of artefacts, provided the terms and conditions it sets out were followed.

A spokesman said: 'We provide guidance to eBay sellers in our help section to make sure that any artefacts they may try to sell comply with the guidelines issued by the authorities, and are always ready and willing to investigate any listings causing concern. 

'We work with experts and will remove items from sale based on their advice.'
