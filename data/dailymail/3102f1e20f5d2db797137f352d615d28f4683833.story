Bones of large animals discovered in south-west France, suggest that Neanderthals were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought.

Our ancient cousins may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and bison, only carrying the meatiest cuts back to their caves.

French archaeologists came to this conclusion because long bones were missing from the carcasses of many of the animals found at the Middle Palaeolithic site in Quincieux.

Neanderthals may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and horses so they only carried the meatiest parts back to their dwellings to eat. French Archaeologists based their idea on bones discovered at the Middle Palaeolithic site in Quincieux, including this section of an ancient horses' spine

Neanderthals lived at the site between 35,000 and 55,000 years ago.

Archaeologists from Institut National de Recherches Archeologiques Preventives (Inrap) in Paris discovered the bones of mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and reindeer when land was being cleared for the new A466 road.

The prehistoric site on a hill would have overlooked the ancient bed of the Saône River and has yielded ‘a rich faunal assemblage’ spread throughout three levels including flaked flint objects made by Neanderthals.

Archaeologists from Inrap said that most of the bones belonged to animals that lived in a cold climate and were herbivores.

Bones of large animals discovered in south western France, suggest that Neanderthals were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought. It is already known that Neanderthals used tools to scrape carcasses clean (illustrated) and sometimes cooked meat before eating it

They also found the skull of a cave bear and a several wolf bones.

The experts think that all the bones belong to animals that were deliberately hunted or scavenged by Neanderthals who used the carcasses. Some of the bones have cutting marks, showing they were butchered.

The archaeologists noted a ‘lack of long bones,’ which they believe shows that only the meat-rich parts of the bodies were carried back to the Neanderthals' homes.

They think the poorly-preserved site might have been a carcass processing area.

It is hoped that the site will reveal more about the behaviour of Neanderthals away from hunting camps and dwellings so that experts learn more about their hunting techniques.

Toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals, who unlike their brutish reputation, had the brains and skill to catch the birds.

The discovery was announced earlier this month after an excavation of Gorham's Cave where Neanderthals are thought to have lived nearly 100,000 years ago.

Archaeologists unearthed leftovers of Neanderthal feasts, which included pigeon bone, in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of Gibraltar.

Researchers believe the Neanderthals hunted wild pigeons, possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests.

So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons.

Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks.

Some also had signs of charring, which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire.

They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,' study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told journalists of the bone analysis.

'They had the knowledge and technology to do this.'

Professor Finlayson said the bone analysis added to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than was once widely believed. 'This makes them even more human,' he said.'

In June, researchers at MIT reported evidence from 50,000-year-old Neanderthal poo that those living in southern Spain also ate nuts and vegetables.

Other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in Neanderthal teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle, harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey.

This because 'long bones' were not found with carcasses
