Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren again said this morning that she's not running for president, regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016.

'You know, I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance. That's what I'm in this fight for, and I'm in this fight all the way,' Warren told NPR today during an interview to discuss her latest battle to keep in place reforms that rein in Wall Street.

The left-wing darling was careful not to say that she was 'never' running, however, leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she's letting on publicly.

If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ultimately decides not to take a second go at higher office, Warren's supporters hope she'll pick up the torch.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, right, is pictured here with Rep. Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, at a press conference last week to express their outrage that a huge, $1.1 trillion spending bill put forward by the Republican-controlled House contains changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that regulates complex financial instruments known as derivatives

Warren led the charge on Capitol Hill last week against a provision in the $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that would roll back restrictions on financial institutions passed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill. 

In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor that has been characterized as a career-defining moment for the freshman legislator, Warren ripped the rider as a measure that 'would do nothing for the middle class, do nothing for community banks, do nothing but raise the risk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again.'

'So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi[group]. I agree with you Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces,' she said, directing her anger at the multinational banking group whose lobbyists are credited with authoring the offending measure.

'Instead of passing laws that create new bailout opportunities for too big to fail banks, let's pass...something...that would help break up these giant banks,' she said.

Continuing, Warren said, 'Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch.  

'Washington already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists. 

'But what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings the last time Citigroup bet big on derivatives and lost? What about the families who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars go to bail out Citi just 6 years ago?' she asked.

Warren said that lawmakers were sent to the nation's capitol 'to fight for those families,' and it 'tt is time - it is past time' for them to start living up to that mandate. 

While she ultimately failed to convince a majority of her party to oppose the bill and it passed both chambers of Congress, the move set alight new calls from the left for her to compete for the presidency in next year's contest.

The left-wing lawmaker, beloved by progressives for her unwavering commitment to holding big banks accountable and fighting for laws she believes will benefit the middle class, comes nowhere close to earning the support of Clinton in polls of Democratic voters. 

Warren often trails party frontrunner Clinton by 40 or more points.

Hard-core Warren supporters believe that 'Hillary fatigue' could create an opening for their icon to seek and win the Democratic nomination, however.

Even if Clinton does continue to track well, the Warren wing of Democratic Party wants the Massachusetts Senator to enter the 2016 horse race to force the party to the left on marquee issues. 

 In a statement released by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee today, the organization's co-founder Stephanie Taylor said 'it is time for Democrats to remold the party around Elizabeth Warren's big economic populist ideas -- like breaking up "too big to fail" banks, expanding Social Security, and making college way more affordable.'

'The way for Democrats to inspire the public is to give Americans the debate about big ideas that we deserve -- and that means following Elizabeth Warren's lead,' she said.

Former Secretary of State and 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton is pictured here at a press conference today. Clinton has not announced her intentions to run for president yet, but she is widely expected to do so in the coming months. Either way, Warren supporters believe their candidate should enter the race.

Of specific concern to Warren's supporters is Clinton's cozy relationship with financial institutions.

As a candidate for office in the past, Clinton accepted funds from wealthy financiers progressives believe are responsible for the 2008 financial meltdown. Since leaving the Obama administration last year she's collected checks in excess of $200,000 a piece from some of the same institutions who benefited from government bailouts six years ago while on the speaking circuit.

Progressives fear that Clinton won't be an effective check on the big banks currently lining her pockets if elected to office and have fiercely advocated on behalf of alternative candidate Warren. 

'I’d love to see [Clinton] match [Warren’s] talking points in terms of the economy, just reforming Wall Street,' Nick Moe, a political activist from Alaska told Politico over the weekend during a progressive gathering in Washington, D.C. 

'She’s [Clinton's] been absolutely silent as the Dodd-Frank legislation is being rolled back. Where was she?' he continued. 

In off-chance that Warren changes her mind and does decide to run for higher office next year, a group of Democratic operatives has set up a political action committee called Ready for Warren to collect information on probable supporters that it can then pass on to Warren's official campaign if she jumps in the race.

The Ready for Warren operation mimics the strategy of a similar group set up in Clinton's name.

The movement to draft Warren has gained steam in recent weeks, as several other possible presidential candidates' self-imposed deadlines to announce their intentions draws near.

At the same time Warren's latest stand against big banks on Capitol Hill has the political class buzzing as the move put her in direct opposition to the White House. 

As support for the massive appropriations bill to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year waned last Thursday, the Obama administration came out in favor of the compromise legislation and strongly urged Democratic lawmakers to do the same.

The White House made clear that it too was unhappy with the provision of the bill that eliminated restrictions on Wall Street but warned that Democrats would likely end up with even less preferable legislation if they forced the issue.

'This is ultimately not a difference over the value of the provision, it’s a difference -- at least among Democrats -- over the strategy,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday.

'The President is certainly sympathetic to those who say this is a terrible provision...the President himself has concerns about the provision and opposes it,' Earnest explained.

'But the President did make a strategic decision about the wisdom of signing the agreement that was before him, as opposed to kicking the can down the road and trying to broker an agreement in which Republicans had more leverage,' he said.

In January when the new Congress convenes Republicans will outnumber Democrats in both legislative chambers, giving them the upper hand until the next set of federal elections, two years from now. 

Warren acknowledged the difficult position the White House found itself in when considering whether to back the legislation in her interview with NPR today and conceded that approving the legislation was ultimately the correct call.

'You know, once the House passed an omnibus bill with this in it and threw it over to the Senate — and then the House left town — at that point, there was very little choice but either to pass the omnibus, even with this thing in it, or shut down the government,' she said.

'And we didn't want to shut down the government.'

Sticking by her principles, though, she derided the provision's supporters for the way they went about making changes to the regulatory system.

'I know for sure that this shouldn't be slipped into an omnibus spending bill — a bill that must pass in order to keep the government open,' she said.

'And what it means, if this works, is they can just kinda keep slipping grenades and attach them to, you know, must-pass spending bills, and pretty soon we have no financial regulations at all,' she warned.
