Police investigating the disappearance of Jessica Heeringa, the Michigan woman abducted in late April during her shift at a gas station, have said that the suspicious substance found at the scene where she vanished is her blood.

'The substance has been confirmed as blood,' police said in a statement released today. 'Based on a subsequent DNA analysis, the blood has been confirmed to be from Jessica Lynn Heeringa.'

Police said that there was only a small amount of blood located at the Norton Shores, Mich., Exxon gas station where Heeringa was working on a late shift. The 25-year-old mother of one was within moments of closing the station when she vanished.

Police have revealed that Jessica Heeringa's blood was found at the gas station where she disappeared

Heeringa's family has been notified that her blood was found at the scene, police said.

Last Tuesday police released a second video 
in the hope that it will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother 
who went missing on April 26.

The video, police say, more 
clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that 
police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel 
this mystery.

A $15,000 reward has been pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared.

The
footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had 
no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm.

Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night.

Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice.

The
tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since 
Heeringa vanished and will be added to the evidence 
investigators have thus far been able to gather.

The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30, 
based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from 
the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate 
their investigation.

'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton 
Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some 
of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the 
sketch.

'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.'

Authorities
have also released previous video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead 
Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area 
around the same time that Heeringa went missing.

Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, 
but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the 
mystery.

Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:
'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it 
up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesnâ€™t exist for me.'

He
told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & 
Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's 
disappearance.

Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old.

Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor.

'There
is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who 
the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews.

Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm.

That
customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he 
normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there.

After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police.

Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend.

In the call, he tells the dispatcher:
'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just 
walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car 
out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.'

Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm.

The missing woman's family made a
heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her 
disappearance as an abduction.

In
a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were 
treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene.

No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter.

Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes.

Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.'

With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation.

'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.'

The
anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved 
by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing 
his mom and wants her back.'

Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident.

'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.'
