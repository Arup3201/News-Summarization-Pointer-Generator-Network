Eight people have been arrested - four on suspicion of murder - for the brutal sword and knife attack on a teenage boy in an affluent suburb of London.

Hani Abou El Kheir, 16, died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, central London on Sunday evening in a suspected drugs-related attack.

Detectives, who believe at least 10 youths were involved in the incident, had already arrested a 20-year-old suspect during an early morning raid in north London on Thursday.

At 6pm tomorrow, detectives investigating Hani's murder will return to the scene to appeal to people living in the area for help with their inquiries.

Four males were arrested on suspicion of murder and one male and three females on suspicion of assisting an offender. They were being held in custody at various police stations, Scotland Yard said.

The 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and bailed until late March.

The teenage victim, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to King's College Hospital following the attack but died later.

Detectives said they were keeping an 'open mind' regarding a motive and were being assisted by a number of witnesses who have already come forward.

Details of the attack emerged as the inquest into Hani's death was officially opened and adjourned this week.

'This 16-year-old male was chased and assaulted by a large number of 
masked and hooded youths, armed with weapons', coroners officer 
Martin Urquhart told Westminster 
Coroner's Court.

'He sustained serious injuries, and despite medical treatment at the 
scene and at Kings College Hospital, he died later that evening.'

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell, of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said Hani suffered a 'horrific and sustained vicious attack'.

He added: 'The tragic events of last Sunday have left Hani's mother and wider family completely devastated.

'Hani's mother has lost her only child 
and is still coming to terms with the heartbreaking events that have led
to the death of her son.

'I am directly appealing to the parents and carers of those believed to be involved - if you have slightest indication that your child may have been involved in this incident I encourage you to get them to hand themselves in to the police.

'Failing to do so will result in my officers pursuing them until we have caught all those responsible.'

A note from the victim's mother, Pauline Hickey, was left with flowers at the scene where he died.It read: 'My baby. My heart is broken. I love you so much, the pain is unbearable. Your loving mother.'

Another tribute attached to a nearby bus stop was a copy of a touching note written by Hani to his mother, alongside a picture of him as a child.

It said: 'Thank you for being the best mum. Love to mummy, thank you for everything. Love from Hani.'

The tribute was signed by relatives including the teenager's grandparents, and cousins in Ireland.

The inquest, officially opened and adjourned by Coroner Jean Harkin officially, will resume at a later date once the police investigation has concluded.
