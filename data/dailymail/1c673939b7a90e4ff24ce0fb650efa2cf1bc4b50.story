A firefighter has survived being thrown up to nine metres in the air and almost crushed after a car he was inspecting on the side of the road was smashed into by a truck.

Dramatic video of the incident first shows Ohio fire captain Barry Cron narrowly avoid being hit by an out-of-control vehicle as it crashes into a pole in icy conditions yesterday.

But when Captain Cron went to see if the victim was alright, another car struck the wreckage from behind.

The father-of-three, who has been a firefighter for more than 20 years, was transported to Miami Valley Hospital where was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

He remains in hospital but his condition has been upgraded to 'good', WDTN.com reports.
