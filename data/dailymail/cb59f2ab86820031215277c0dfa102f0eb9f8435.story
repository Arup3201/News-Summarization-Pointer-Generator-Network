Chris Gayle bemoaned the England demise of his absent friend as he called the ECB’s decision to sack Kevin Pietersen ‘disrespectful.’

West Indies’ great entertainer returns from injury for the first of three Twenty20 internationals on Sunday at the Kensington Oval in Barbados disappointed that the player of the tournament when England won the short-form World Cup four years ago will not be back in Bridgetown now.

‘I’m disappointed by the manner he had to bow out of international cricket,’ said Gayle, a close friend of Pietersen and a key figure in West Indies own World Twenty20 triumph in Sri Lanka two years ago. ‘It’s disrespectful, the way he had to go. He’ll definitely be missed by spectators, so I will try to put on a display.

‘I don’t know what happened behind closed doors but for such a big player who has made such an impact around the world to go out like that was sad.

'You want to give a great player the chance to retire and walk away from the game regardless of what has happened.

'We have swapped a few texts since the decision was made and he will be OK, I'm sure. he has a lot of business to do. I actually think he will be playing on Sunday! He will be replacing Joe Root!’

That will not happen, with England’s resolve as strong as ever to move on without Pietersen, believing their decision to sack him a ‘no brainer’ after constant bad behaviour in Australia while being on a final warning. Indeed, they have several pages of cumulated evidence on why he had to go.

There is no question that England’s hopes both in this three-match series and in the World Twenty20 that follows in Bangladesh will be lesser without Pietersen but they believe the short-term pain will be worth the long-term gain.

One England player who is very much here and delighted to be so is home-town boy Chris Jordan, who will be watched by a large number of family and friends on his return to his native Barbados with his adopted country.

Jordan has long since thrown in his lot with England having been spotted here by former England batsman Bill Athey and offered a scholarship at Dulwich College and he insists there will be no conflicting emotions if, as expected, he returns to the England team on Sunday having missed the last two games.

‘It’s a very nice feeling to be back,’ 
said Jordan, who is trying to claim the whole of England’s allocation of
 tickets for Sunday's match. ‘I will be very proud to wear an England 
shirt in Barbados. ‘I don’t know how the home spectators will react to 
me but my family and friends are behind me a hundred per cent and that’s
 what matters to me. I’m more than happy with my decision.’

In an ideal world Jordan should be playing for West Indies but, to be fair to him, he has said that he wanted to play for England from the moment he started making an impact at Surrey as a teenager and served a qualification period, even playing for Barbados in English winters as an overseas player. He insists no serious approach has ever been made to him to play for West Indies.

Serious back injuries and a loss of form prompted a move to Sussex where he finally fulfilled his huge potential and he has made a good impression in the handful of one-day appearances he has so far made against Australia and now West Indies.

He will play on Sunday if England leave out one of the spinners who served them so well in Antigua on what is expected to be a much better Barbados pitch than the one seen at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium for a one-day series that England won 2-1.
