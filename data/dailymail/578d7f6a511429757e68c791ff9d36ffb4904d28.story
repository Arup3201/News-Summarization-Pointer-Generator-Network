Cesc Fabregas made Premier League history after becoming the  first player to assist a goal in six consecutive games.

The Chelsea midfielder's run follows on from his spell with Arsenal, when he set up goals in his final two top-flight games for the Gunners before departing for Barcelona in 2011. 

Fabregas broke the record with two assists for Diego Costa in the Blues' 4-2 victory over Swansea which keeps them top of the fledgling Premier League table. 

Record breaker: Cesc Fabregas, taking on Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis, has assists in his last six Premier League games 

Match made in heaven: Fabregas has forged an instant understanding with fellow new boy Diego Costa 

Cesc Fabregas is the first player in Premier League history to get an assist in six consecutive Premier League games 

For Chelsea against: Swansea (two), Everton, Leicester and Burnley (two)  

For Arsenal against: Bolton and Spurs

And five players have scored in five consecutive games: 

Darren Anderton - Spurs, 1992/93

Gianfranco Zola - Chelsea, 2002/03 

Ryan Giggs - Man United, 2002/03

Thierry Henry -  Arsenal, 2004/05

Antonio Valencia - Man United, 2011/12 

He also assisted Costa for goals against Everton and Hazard versus Leicester as he proves himself an inspired piece of business by Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. 

And the Spaniard had started the season in flying form, laying on goals for Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic on the opening weekend of the season at Burnley.

The 27-year-old finished his Arsenal career how he has started his spell in west London. 

Fabregas laid on a goal for Robin van Persie in a defeat at Bolton after setting up efforts for Theo Walcott and van Persie in a thrilling 3-3 draw at north London rivals Spurs.

Before Fabregas' sparkling performance against the Swans he had been one of six players with assists in five consecutive Premier League appearances. 

But Chelsea's new hero moves ahead of Darren Anderton, Gianfranco Zola, Ryan Giggs, Thierry Henry and Antonio Valencia to set a new benchmark.
