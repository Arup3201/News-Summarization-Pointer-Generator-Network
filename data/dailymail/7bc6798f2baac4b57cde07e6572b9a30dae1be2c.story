The satisfaction for trainer Willie Mullins of leaving Fairyhouse yesterday with two more Cheltenham Festival favourites in his armoury was extinguished by two massive blows.

Ireland’s champion trainer lost hugely promising Allez Colombieres. The French import had to be put down after suffering a pelvic injury in the Grade One Royal Bond Hurdle.

Mullins also faces an uphill race against to get Annie Power to the Cheltenham Festival with a stress fracture of a rear leg looking like the reason why she went lame before being pulled out of the Hatton’s Grace Hurdle.

If the diagnosis is confirmed the mare, who was second to More of That in the World Hurdle in March, will need up to 10 weeks rest.

Allez Colombieres, another recruit from across the Channel, had been favourite for the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle on reputation alone but his Irish debut in a race won by stablemate Nichols Canyon lasted only two jumps before being pulled up by Ruby Walsh.

Mullins said a fracture in the sacroiliac region of his pelvis had cut the iliac artery causing internal bleeding.

The setbacks came as French import Kalkir was promoted to 5-1 favourite for the Triumph Hurdle after a smooth eight-length in the Grade Three Juvenile Hurdle under Walsh while Valseur Lido heads of the betting at 5-1 for the JLT Novices’ Chase after his impressive eight-length success in a highly competitive Grade One Drinmore Novices’ Chase under Bryan Cooper.

On a day with significant Festival news, Jonjo O’Neill also revealed More Of That will have breathing issues investigated after losing his unbeaten record when third in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury.

While Oliver Sherwood said Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds will have one run before a probable tilt at the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

The Argento Chase at Cheltenham in January or Denman Chase at Newbury the following month are options for a seven-year-old Sherwood feels is still improving.

Sherwood said: ‘Last season he was a teenager, this season he is a man.’

Many Cloud’s half-brother The Tullow Tank was a disappointing fifth in the Drinmore but his trainer, Sandra Hughes, landed an emotional first Grade One race since taking over the stable of late father Dessie when Lieutenant Colonel landed the Hatton’s Grace under Cooper.
