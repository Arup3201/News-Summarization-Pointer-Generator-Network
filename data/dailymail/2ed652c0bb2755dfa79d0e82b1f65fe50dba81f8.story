Andy Gray is on BT Sport’s shortlist to be co-commentator when their Champions League coverage starts next season.

Gray, who is working for beIN Sport, based in Doha, made two guest appearances in that role during BT’s FA Cup broadcasts last season and would jump at the chance to return to mainstream English TV on a regular basis.

BT, who need to augment their football talent before taking up exclusive live UK rights for the Champions League, are expected to finalise their plans in January.

Gray is widely acknowledged as football’s best co-commentator. But after the storm over sexist comments about female assistant referee Sian Massey that led to his departure from Sky Sports in 2011, Gray’s appointment would have to be approved by BT Sport’s new chief Delia Bushell. A women’s campaign group criticised BT for using Gray in the FA Cup.

However, it might be more than coincidental that news of a BT move for Gray has emerged after Michael Owen chose to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the States rather than work on BT Sport’s Newcastle v Liverpool match last Saturday. 

BT are understood to have been disappointed by Owen’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him. So much so that if Owen misses another game in similar circumstances, there could be a parting of the ways.
