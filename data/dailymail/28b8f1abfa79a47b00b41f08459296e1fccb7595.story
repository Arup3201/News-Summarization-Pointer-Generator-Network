USA captain Clint Dempsey appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman on Wednesday night in a further indication of the rise in popularity of football in America.

Seattle Sounders forward Dempsey was quizzed by the veteran chat show host on the popular show about the USA’s performances at the World Cup at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York.

The 31-year-old forward received a standing ovation as he walked out, with the crowd repeatedly chanting 'USA'.

Dempsey appeared on the show alongside fellow guests Halle Berry, Joan Rivers and Michael Douglas.

Dempsey – who spent much of his career in
 the Premier League with Fulham and then Tottenham Hotspur – played a 
key role in the USA’s success in Brazil.

Jurgen Klinsmann's men made it to the last 16 of the World Cup and pushed Belgium all the way to extra-time before being knocked out of the tournament.

Captain Dempsey scored twice in the tournament – including the fifth fastest goal in World Cup history with his strike after just 29 seconds in their opening game against Ghana – and became the first American to score in three successive World Cups.

And Klinsmann's team captured the imagination of the American public so much so that 21million people tuned into watch the extra time defeat to Belgium on ESPN – more than the watched the World Series and NBA Finals.

US President Barack Obama was so gripped by the action that he watched one of the group games aboard Air Force One and then the defeat to Belgium in the Eisenhower Executive Office at the White House.

Elsewhere, hundreds of American fanatics camped out under the Manhattan Bridge to enjoy the match for free, while supporters also flocked to Victory Park in Dallas, where the match was projected on the side of the American Airlines Center.

Meanwhile, Dempsey will make his comeback for the Seattle Sounders against Portland on Sunday at CenturyLink Field.
