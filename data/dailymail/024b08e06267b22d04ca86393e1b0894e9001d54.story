Released: Anthony Marshall, seen here in his mug shot, has been given parole

The 89-year-old heir to New York socialite Brooke Astor has been given medical parole after serving just two months of a prison sentence for siphoning millions from his ailing mother's estate.

Anthony Marshall was sentenced to a one- to three-year sentence in June but a medical parole decided today that he is too ill to serve his sentence for grand larceny.

Marshall's doctors said he suffers from Parkinson's, uses a wheelchair and is dependent on others to help with daily tasks.Â 

Under state law, inmates with serious and permanent illnesses can be given medical parole, according to CBS News.

The
New York parole board decided unanimously to free Marshall because he 
was 'suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal condition, 
disease or syndrome'.

He has been at an disclosed hospital for at least a month, according to the New York Post, and cannot walk or use the bathroom by himself.

The
parole board also considered the $14.5 million in restitution Marshall 
paid for stealing from his elderly mother to fund a Maine estate and 
55ft yacht among other luxuries.

Marshall,
who was given his discharge papers at 4.30pm today, will remain under 
the supervision of a New York parole officer until June 20, 2016, which 
is the latest possible date of his sentence.

The
89-year-old had been found guilty of stealing millions from his 
family's estate after his mother had Alzheimer's diagnosed in the years 
leading up to her death.

When his lawyers first filed for medical parole last month, a source told the New York Post: 
'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new 
doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago.

'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.'

When sentenced in June, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009.

Mr Bartely said he would rather not jail the Second World War veteran, but prosecutors argued that his state of health and war record should not mean an early release.

Marshall's lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side.

When Marshall was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term in June, his wife wept and hugged him.

He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health.

Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007.

Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor.

Astor
inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a 
great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, 
who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S.

When Marshall arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder.

In
earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the 
family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive 
for Marshall taking money from his mother.

Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times.

The
original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law 
and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'.

Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them.

At Marshall's sentencing, the judge 
read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court
to spare him prison.

'Please
consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My 
father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you
can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He
urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him.

Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial.

And
it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his 
father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed.

Prosecutors said Marshall, a former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money.

He also took valuable artwork off her
walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most 
of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite 
charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.

Astor had devoted her life to 
philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, 
the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum.

However,
the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly 
heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue 
apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help.

She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill 
estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home
in Manhattan, were later sold.

When the wranglings over her $100 million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick $74,680 worth of her possessions.

He chose a mixture of items, from a 
$30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a 
donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said.

In
the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 
million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which 
had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10 million in
2002.

The Astor family 
made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's 
step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die 
on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top 
deck.
