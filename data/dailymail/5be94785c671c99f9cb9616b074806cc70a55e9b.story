Reality TV star and accused White House gatecrasher Michaele Salahi has run off with Journey's lead guitarist.

Salahi's husband, Tareq, had claimed his wife had been kidnapped and criticised authorities for not looking for her.

Now it has been revealed Michaele, who starred in Real Housewives of DC is actually living with Journey rocker Neal Schon, the New York Post reports.

Found: Michaele Salahi surfaced in Nashville after her husband Tareq reported her missing after she failed to return to their Virginia home on Tuesday

'Mrs. Salahi said she did not want Mr. Salahi to know where she was,' said police in Warren County, Virginia, in a statement.

New love interest: Michaele turned up in Memphis with Journey guitarist Neal Schon

'She seemed calm, was engaged in 
conversation and assured the deputy that she had left the residence with
a good friend and was where she wanted to be.

'She advised she did not want to be home right now.'

There were some initial suspicions 
that the 'disappearance' was simply a publicity stunt by the Salahis, 
who made a splash in November 
2009 when they managed to get into President Obama's first official 
state dinner at the White House.

But it seems she has simply found love elsewhere.

According to website TMZ, Michaele has 
previously enjoyed a 'intimate and passionate relationship' with Schon 
in the past and went to his show in Nashville on Tuesday.

The reality star is now said to be in Memphis with Schon as he continues his U.S tour.

Tareq, who is 'devastated' that his wife has left him, raised the alarm after Michaele failed to return to their home in Virginia on Tuesday. 

'It is our belief as of last night, 
Michaele Salahi may have been kidnapped or abducted and is being held 
under duress and forced to tell persons, including authorities, she is 
OK,' a representative for Tareq told CCN.

She told him that she was heading out to the hairdresser's followed by
a dance class, but reportedly never turned up for her 11am hair 
appointment.

Later she made a phone call from a peculiar cell number to Tareq, informing him that she was going to visit her mother.

But Michaele's mother told Tareq that they never made arrangement to meet up.

Tareq reported his wife missing both to the Warren County Sheriff's Department and the FBI.

But deputies at the local authorities told Tareq that his wife had previously contacted them to inform them that she was OK. 

She had told them she was 'dealing with family issues and was safe.'

Close friend and fellow Housewives star Jenna Keough also expressed her concern for Michaele today, according to Radaronline.

The
Real Housewives Of Orange County star, who has been trying to get in 
touch with her friend, publicly pleaded with Michaele to head straight 
to a police station or to call her immediately.

'Check
in with a police department in person to verify that you are safe. 
There are simply too many crazy people in the world. I know you have 
been plagued with stalkers, and I'm extremely concerned for your 
safety,' she said in a message via Radaronline.

The strange incident comes after 
Michaele and Tareq were reportedly set to make a move from the East to 
the West Coast in the coming weeks.

The couple were said to be in final negotiations last month, to lease a house in Beverly Hills for a cool $20,000 a month.

A
source told entertainment news website TMZ the former Real Housewives 
of D.C couple wanted to move closer to Hollywood to further their 
'entertainment careers.'

It was also recently revealed that the couple were allegedly planning to have a baby through a surrogate mother.

The
pair had reportedly met with professionals at the Northern Virginia 
Center for Surrogate Parenting, also last month, in the hopes of getting
the process underway.

Michaele
told TMZ she wanted to go with a surrogate because she suffers from 
multiple sclerosis ... and was worried that her condition combined with 
her age would prove difficult for her to carry a baby.

She said: 'I'm overjoyed with the hope of starting a family and the blessing of love and peace a child will bring to our lives.'

The couple are set to sell their Oasis Vineyards winery a bankruptcy auction next week.

The Salahis rose to notoriety after it was revealed they had gatecrashed a White House party attended by President Barack Obama.

The couple mingled with VIPs as Mr 
Obama and his wife, Michelle, welcomed guests to the dinner honouring 
Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.

Their
antics were only discovered when they posted photographs of themselves 
hobnobbing with Washington's elite on their Facebook page causing major 
embarrassment to the President's security team.
