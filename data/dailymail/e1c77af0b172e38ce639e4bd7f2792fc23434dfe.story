Nearby residents said the boy was stabbed by a black teenager, aged approximately 16, who was wearing a baseball cap and who also pushed a passenger to the ground before running off through the nearby Spring Gardens Estate.

passengers on the bus milling around and people were giving him CPR. I

working on him for quite a long time.

attacked him went to the back of the bus and stabbed him. He then pushed
someone over, jumped off the bus and ran through the estate'

'But then a workman said that it was a boy who had been stabbed.

'The police and then the ambulance turned up and took over. At first there was just one police car and then loads turned up.

'The next thing was the air ambulance arrived and landed in the car park of Highbury Grove school.

'They put the boy on a stretcher with a white screen around him - I don’t think it looked very good.'

scene, described seeing the boy being given CPR as he lay in the road.

She said: 'They were doing CPR on the road. It’s a little child. He was very young only Year 1 or so.

'An air ambulance arrived and parked in the school playground and then took off about half an hour later.

'People are still on the bus and they are taking their details.'

She added that she believed that the young stabbing victim may have been a pupil at a nearby school. 

A local resident said on Twitter: 
'Stabbing on bus right outside my house - police everywhere & 
paramedics trying to save his life by my garden gate.'
