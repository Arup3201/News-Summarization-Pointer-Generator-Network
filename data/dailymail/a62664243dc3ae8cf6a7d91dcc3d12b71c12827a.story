However, Madrid appear to be in pole position in the race for his signature after the youngster jetted in from south Oslo.

Odegaard visited the La Liga outfit in November ahead of their Champions League clash against the Reds, which they won 1-0.

The young gun is one of the hottest properties around and has most recently been linked with Dutch giants Ajax.

Odegaard is the youngest player in the history of the European Championship after coming on in Norway's win over Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

But former Liverpool full-back John Arne Riise insists there's too much pressure on his compatriot's shoulders.

'I feel a bit sorry for the boy,' Riise told Dagbladet. 'With anticipation the pressure rises. There is talk of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal. It makes people expect a lot.

'But he does seem to have his feet firmly on the ground and it seems like he has a great family around him. 

'Even so, it will be tough for him now. People are wary of him and people will look out for him.'
