Several dozen people became ill after eating guinea pig meat at a Minneapolis food festival earlier this month.

At least 81 people are known to have gotten food poisoning from eating the unusual dish August 11 at the Ecuadorian food festival. Though not commonly eaten in the US, guinea pig is seen as a delicacy in many South American countries.

Preliminary testing of the people confirmed they had salmonella poising, according to CBS Minnesota.

The vendor that served the exotic fare has yet to be identified, but the store that held that festival has been closed in recent days, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

City officials told the paper that New York Plaza Produce, where the festival was held, and other vendors may face reprimand for selling ‘unapproved and mishandled food.’

The city may levy fines or even go as far as revoking permits held by the location, according to the paper.

Eaten mostly in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, guinea pig is gaining in popularity in the US, according to a recent USA Today report.

Saying ‘they can be consumed literally from head to toe,’ USA Today added that ‘fans of the roasted rodent say they're tasty, tender, and oily.’
