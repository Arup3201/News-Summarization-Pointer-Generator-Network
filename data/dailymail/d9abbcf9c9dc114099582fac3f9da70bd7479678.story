After finding the net twice in his first two matches for Chelsea, perhaps Diego Costa was checking that his goal bonus had been paid in.

The £32m striker was snapped at a cash machine in Imperial Wharf, not far from Stamford Bridge, just hours after setting the Blues on their way to victory over Leicester City.

The picture was posted on Twitter by a Chelsea fan and quickly went viral.

Debut goal: Costa had also scored on his first Premier League start at Burnley on Monday night

Still dressed in a Chelsea training top and tracksuit bottoms, the Spaniard cut a conspicuous figure as he checked his balance.

He had spared Chelsea from a frustrating afternoon against the newly-promoted side, breaking the deadlock just after the hour mark, before Eden Hazard made sure of the points with 13 minutes left.

Costa, signed from Atletico Madrid, opened his account at Burnley in Monday's 3-1 win, and his manager Jose Mourinho has been impressed by the speed of the Brazil-born forward's transition.

'I got the feeling in pre-season that his adaptation would not be a big deal, he is an easy guy,' said Mourinho.

'His style of play has adapted to our needs, so it has not been a problem.'

Impressed: Jose Mourinho has been pleased with the way Costa has adapted to English football 

But Mourinho was not impressed with his side's slow start to the match.

He said: 'I prefer to train in the morning, but this week I trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football, you get lazy.

'This weather pushes players to be a bit lazy, to lose a bit of tension, a bit of sharpness in your body, after that you pass slow, you do not react to the second balls, the time goes on and on, then when you wake up, it is half-time.

'In the first half, the team was lazy, and I did not like that.

'But they improved in the second half and they won, which is the most important thing.

'At half-time, we had to be a bit emotional with them. I told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game and that we were at risk.

'It is impossible to play football if you do not win one second ball, it was basic but important things.'

Chelsea, who top the table after the first two matches, travel to Everton next.
