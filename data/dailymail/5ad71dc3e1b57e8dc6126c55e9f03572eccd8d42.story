Joe Hart hopes champions Manchester City return from the international break reinvigorated and refocused on club duty after a difficult run.

City have one win in six matches after drawing 2-2 at QPR on Saturday to sit eight points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea.

Manuel Pellegrini's side twice trailed at Loftus Road, going behind to a Charlie Austin strike and a Martin Demichelis own goal, but Sergio Aguero twice netted equalisers to salvage a point for stuttering City.

'It was a tough game,' goalkeeper Hart said.

'We struggled a bit, but we came back into it well and we did well to get the second goal.

'We stood up, quality shone through. We'd like to have won it, but we'll take the point.

'I'd like to think we're going to come back fresh. We're going to be together for a lot longer now - we haven't got an international break breaking us up over Christmas.

'We've got four months to really get our heads down and get ourselves into this league.'

Hart was in the thick of the action, impressing with a series of saves and he was involved in a contentious first-half moment when Austin thought he had scored.

Hart kicked a free-kick twice, firstly with his standing foot, before the striker scored. Referee Mike Dean correctly ruled out the effort.

'He (Austin) was a constant threat,' said Hart, who spoke to the QPR forward on leaving the field.

'I just wanted to explain what happened with my two-touch free-kick and what the rules were.'

QPR are much improved after a challenging start to the campaign, with manager Harry Redknapp praising his squad.

'It's all about spirit in the team,' Redknapp said.

'We recruited late, brought people in and flung a team together, so it's taken a bit of time for us to get an understanding.

'The Chileans (Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla) are showing what good players they are, (Leroy) Fer is settled and fit.

'We need Sandro to play more 90-minute games, Jordon Mutch is getting fit now. But we're getting better. Hopefully we'll keep improving.'
