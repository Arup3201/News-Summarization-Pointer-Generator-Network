An extremist Libyan militia has captured twelve men who now face mutilation and execution for allegedly being gay.

The militia stormed a private party in Ain Zara, a suburb of the capital Tripoli, late on Thursday night and took the men hostage.

Pictures of the men with their hands up against the wall and their faces covered as well as one of a man's back with a henna tattoo have been posted on Facebook.

Under threat of death: Twelve men face mutilation and execution after they were captured by an extremist Libyan militia

One of the pictures was accompanied by the Quranic call 'there is no power but the power of Allah!'

Gay Star News reported that the group labelled the men the 'third sex' which is a term used in the Arab Gulf area to denote homosexuals.

At the time of writing, the picture of the men received 133 likes, 138 shares, and 189 comments some of which were 'flog them hard!', ‘let them see bullets!’, ‘free Libya! [ie from gays]’ and ‘ride them like camels’.

The militia call themselves the 'special deterrence unit' on their Facebook page and on it they boast that they caught the men doing the 'practices of the people of Lot' (i.e having gay sex) and that the men are to be mutilated and executed.

The group also posted this picture of a man's back with a henna tattoo which has received 46 likes and 30 shares

Human Rights Libya left a 
comment saying the organisation hopes the men will not be treated 
inhumanely and called upon the militia to hand the men to the civil 
authorities.

They identified the group as the Al-Nawasi militia, who are considered to be extreme Salafists.

The group also claims that they have now become a legal part of the Libyan Ministry of Interior.

They state their mission is to remove ‘corruption’, ‘vice’, alcoholic drinks and now gays from the streets of Libya.

A Libyan LGBT activist nicknamed Khaleed told Gay Star News: ‘Many of us fear that some of the 
militias [there are over 250 of them in the country], which are extreme 
Islamists who are very well armed and financed, will focus on the LGBT 
community and hunt us down.

‘The
 police is largely absent or powerless so Libyan civil society has a 
real problem; the militias often take the law onto their own hands.

‘That
 the Al Nawasi militia claims they are now part of the Ministry of 
Interior is very worrying; this move should be unacceptable to the 
public and to civil society groups.’

The group's Facebook page (pictured) features the photo of the men which has attracted many 'likes' and 'shares'
