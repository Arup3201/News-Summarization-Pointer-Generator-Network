An Indian Jaguar owner has taken to driving round town in his new car with it being pulled by donkeys because he says it is the only way to make it move.

Businessman Rahul Thackreym, 38, who lives in India's western Ahmedabad city came up with the idea after the brand new £53,000 car repeatedly broke down.

He claims he went back to the dealership to get the Jaguar XJ model fixed on several occasions, but as soon as one problem was fixed, another cropped up.

Indian businessman Rahul Thackreym, 38, hitched his brand new £53,000 Jaguar XJ up to donkeys and had them pull the car around after complaining that it kept breaking down

He said: 'I was fed up with going back and getting them to put things right only to have something else go wrong.

'In order to make sure I could at least still use it and to let the dealer know what I thought of their cars, I came up with the idea of having it towed around by donkeys.

'Basically, a donkey it seems is more reliable than a Jaguar.'

He added: 'In my opinion, this car is worse than a sardine tin on wheels.

'I have taken it to many authorised dealers and garages but it has not helped me. It has so many problems I can't even list them all.'

Mr Thackreym said the car was

He said that he had bought the car on May 7 when the trouble started: 'The lights first went off, I asked them for a change. They had no lights. I screamed, they changed the lights.

'Then the bumper fell off and it got repaired in 10 days when it is mandatory to repair it in 48 hours. And that was just the start.

'My family joked that it would have been better to buy a donkey cart, and actually I thought that wasn't a bad idea, so I got a few animals sent round and hitched up to the car.'

The Indian dealership declined to comment on the case as they are still in talks with Mr Thackreym.
