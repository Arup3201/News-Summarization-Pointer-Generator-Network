A corner shop owner has been fined £6,000 after dried blood was left smeared across a dirty freezer and mouse droppings were found inside the packaging of a loaf of bread.

Council inspectors made the stomach churning discovery at the popular Dizz Food in Dagenham, Essex.

Officials from Barking & Dagenham Council found the shop over-run by mice, with rodent excrement found on the floor, shelves and on food products.

Owner Chukwume Okoruwe, 38, was found guilty of five food hygiene offences, including pest infestation and dirty food equipment, after he denied the charges.

He has been ordered to pay more than £6,000 and told to pay a victim surcharge of £120 at Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London, between February 26 and 28.

A Barking & Dagenham Council spokeswoman said: 'There were gnawed food products, including loaves of bread, with one loaf containing a mouse dropping inside the packaging.

'There was an accumulation of refuse in the rear yard and the shop was dirty.

'There was a dirty freezer with dried blood at the bottom.'

She said that no safety management system was in place to ensure food was safe for eating.

The spokeswoman said the back door to the shop was 'in disrepair', allowing mice to get in.

'The environmental health team who visited the property decided there was an imminent risk to health and offences were contrary to food hygiene regulations,' she added.

Okoruwe was found to have persistently broken food hygiene regulations since July 2009.

He flouted the law time and again despite repeated attempts by council environmental officers to offer him advice and guidance.

After the case, Cllr Jeanne Alexander, the council’s Cabinet Member for Crime, Justice and Communities, said: 'We have offered support and guidance yet the shop owner repeatedly chose to ignore attempts by the council to help.

'Our Environmental Team will continue to help and give advice to local businesses who need our support.

'The safety of the residents of the borough is top priority for us and if we catch business owners breaking the rules, there will be no option but to take appropriate action even if it means taking them to court.

'This case sends out a clear message that we will take action against repeat offenders who are putting people’s health at risk.

'My congratulations go to our Environmental Team for another successful prosecution and another battle won to keep the borough free from dirt and grime.'
