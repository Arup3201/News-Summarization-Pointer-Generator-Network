A farmer left skeletons belonging to sheep, pigs and lambs rotting in wheelie bins, trailers and animals pens on his land.

Albert Nelson, 76, discarded raw meat and bones in the sheep pen, while sheep carcasses were left to decompose under blankets and metal sheets in the yard.

Inspectors also found a makeshift stable containing the carcass of a horned sheep,
 the face of which had been eaten away.

They also found a trailer full of bones, 
skeletons and black binbags at the farm in Broughton, Lancashire.

Albert Nelson, 76, a farmer from Broughton, Lancashire, left rotting carcasses lying around his farm in wheelie bins, trailers and animals pens

Nelson, who owns the farm, was prosecuted under laws designed to prevent disease outbreaks such as foot-and-mouth and BSE.

By failing to dispose of the animal carcasses, he risked sparking a serious outbreak of disease, the court was told.

Nick McNamara, prosecuting for Lancashire Trading Standards, told Preston Magistrates Court that the first inspection was in March 2013.

He said: 'The circumstances go back to March 20, 2013, when animal health officers, responding to a complaint, attended the defendants farm at Broughton.

'The purpose of the officers’ visit was to inspect the proper disposal of  livestock carcasses and, having first introduced themselves to Mr Nelson, they set about an inspection of farm buildings in a yard near the farmhouse.

'The first building they entered is described as a pig building where they found three sheep and a lamb.

The bones and skeletons were from sheep, pigs and lambs. Some had rotted right down to the bone, pictured left, while some were merely covered up with sheets, pictured right

'At the back of the pig building was an area containing two large sows, in front of which were piled crates and plastic bags containing scraps of pink meat.

'Outside the pig building, in the farmyard, were piled tins of an Indian vegetable-type food product bearing an expired best-before date.

'And in the boot of a nearby pick-up were found bags of unlabelled dry feed.'

Nelson, described as a 'small-scale keeper of livestock' including sheep, cattle and pigs, was unable to produce records of where he bought the products.

Inspectors were so shocked with what they found that the first inspection was stopped, while specialists were called in to deal with the animal remains

Officers were so concerned the inspection was suspended to call in specialists from the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA).

It was during that inspection, following the arrival of two vets, that even more carcasses were found.

Nelson was issued with an immediate standstill notice to stop him moving any live animals off or onto the farm.

He was also issued with an animal-by products notice, requiring the immediate removal of the carcasses.

Nelson was prosecuted under laws which are designed to stop the outbreak of disease, such as foot-and-mouth and BSE. The court heard the carcasses posed 'a real and obvious risk' to the environment

Two further visits took place six days later and on April 9, 18 and 26 where inspectors found more animal skeletons.

Mr McNamara added: 'Rotting carcasses pose a real and obvious risk to the environment.

'Clearly, many of the carcasses found on Mr Nelson’s land had been there for some length of time, given their severely decomposed condition.

'And it stands to reason that somebody on the farm knew there were carcasses about, given some of the crude attempts to conceal them beneath rubbish, in bags and, in the case of two animals, in wheelie bins.'

Nelson admitted seven contraventions of disease control measures. The court heard the offences happened when he was suffering from ill health

Nelson admitted seven contraventions of disease control measures.

Defending, Angela Rossi said the offences happened at a time when the farmer was suffering from ill health.

She said: 'Six months earlier DEFRA had visited and said everything was ok and so something has got out of hand in a short space of time.'

The chairman of the magistrates bench said: 'There was a very real and obvious risk to the environment and disregard to other animals and a serious risk to land and water'

He will be sentenced on September 3.
