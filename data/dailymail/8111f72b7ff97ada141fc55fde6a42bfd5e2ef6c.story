Comforts for a killer: Kenneth Noye, who stabbed a man to death on the M25, has been secretly moved to a minimum-security prison at Lowdham Grange, near Nottingham

The M25 road rage killer Kenneth Noye has been moved to a ‘holiday camp’ jail after his security status was downgraded.

Noye, 64, was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron, whom he stabbed to death during a fight on the M25 four years earlier.

The multi-millionaire gangland killer, who fled to Spain after the stabbing in 1996 but was extradited two years later, denied murder, instead claiming that it was self defence – a claim rejected by an Old Bailey jury.

Just two years before the stabbing he had been released from jail after serving eight years of a  14-year sentence for his part in the £26million Brink’s-Mat bullion robbery in 1983.

Yesterday it emerged that he has been secretly transferred from Whitemoor, a high security jail near March in Cambridgeshire, to the Category B Lowdham Grange, near Nottingham.

Inmates at Lowdham Grange have described the prison as a ‘holiday camp’, with individual cells, personal televisions, PlayStations, fridges and en-suite bathrooms.

Sources have said it is to prepare him for his release, which could come in as little as four years’ time.

Despite being viewed as a model prisoner by guards at Whitemoor, his move has infuriated the family of his victim.

Victim: Stephen Cameron, 21, who was knifed to death by Noye, with his girlfriend Danielle Cable. He died at the Swanley interchange in Kent in May 1996

At his new digs in Lowdham Grange, Kenneth Noye will be able to enjoy a string of luxuries.

In what will surely make uncomfortable reading for the Cameron family, their son's killer will be able to stock his own fridge and kick back with a Playstation.

He will also be able to watch television and take a shower in his en-suite cell.

So cushy is the category B  facility near Nottingham, it has been nicknamed the 'holiday camp' by prisoners.

Noye will also be allowed his own bedding and to wear his own clothes, while cells come equipped with hobby kits.

He'll be able to keep trim with a range of fitness classes, including volleyball and badminton.

The prison also offers courses in arts and crafts, computer studies and creative writing to name but a few should Noye want to further his education.

The facility is a training prison so Noye can also sign up to vocational courses including gardening and sports studies.

According to a report from May, prisoners spent 'plenty of time' out of their cells.'

Stephen Cameron’s father Ken, 64, 
said: ‘He is still a very dangerous man. A leopard never changes its 
spots. But now he’s going to get a softer time inside.’

Speaking from his home in Norfolk, he 
added: ‘They are moving him to a softer prison and didn’t even let us 
know. It’s outrageous. Out of courtesy I would hope we would have been 
notified.

‘He’s got around three-and-a-half years to go in prison. Surely this is too early to de-categorise him to Category B?

‘With his money and contacts it must make it easier for him to attempt to escape.’

Prison officers at Whitemoor are said 
to have been given a secret briefing at 7am on Thursday. Noye was then 
placed in a van where he was handcuffed to a guard and driven from 
Cambridgeshire to Nottinghamshire.

Six years ago he had been moved to 
another jail after Whitemoor officers were said to have discovered that 
he had arranged to have a mobile phone – with which he planned to 
co-ordinate a breakout – smuggled into the unit in a box of Weetabix.

He was transferred under armed guard 
to the maximum security Full Sutton prison in York before later being 
moved back to Whitemoor.

Noye was involved in laundering the proceeds of the Brink’s-Mat robbery in the 1980s.

While under investigation in 1985 he 
stabbed to death an undercover detective, John Fordham, in the grounds 
of his home in West Kingsdown, Kent. Noye was cleared of murder on the 
grounds that he was acting in self defence.

He was, however, convicted of handling
stolen gold and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was released in 
1994. Mr Cameron was murdered in 1996.

Noye was convicted in 2000 and appeals
in 2001 and 2004 failed. But last year his case was referred to the 
Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Earlier this year he lost his attempt at the Court of Appeal to overturn his murder conviction.

A spokesman for the Prison Service said: ‘We do not comment on the location of individual prisoners.’
