Fiesta Island in San Diego was evacuated on Saturday after tourists spotted a vintage looking explosive device nestled in the sand.

What appeared to be a military mortar shell dating back to World war II was discovered at around 3:25 p.m.

NBC San Diego reports that soon after the explosive was found, officials ordered everyone to evacuate the Island as quickly as possible.

The Sand Diego Fire Rescue Department's Metro Arson Strike Team sent a robot to photograph the 60 millimeter mortar.

The military bomb squad arrived to take over the investigation.

NBC reports that even though the mortar may have been old, it still could have been deadly.

'There was enough concern in this incident that they did feel that there was a danger and that it was highly probable that it was a live, high explosive round,' said Lt. Paul Rorrison with the San Diego Police Department.

Many visitors who were visiting the island to ride their bicycles or participate in water sports were stranded on the mainland for hours.

NBC spoke to Chuck and Rhonda Martin who were forced to wait for hours for their truck which was parked on the Island as police investigated.

This was the first time they parked their truck on the island and they also said it would be their last.

'I'm cold, hungry, tired and I want my truck,' said Chuck.

Chuck and Rhonda, along with the rest of the people evacuated were finally able to return to the island where no one was harmed.

The military bomb squad brought the mortar to a bunker where they could examine and destroy it in order to prevent it from going off.The Mail Online tried contacting the San Diego Fire Department's Metro Arson Strike Team but no one was available to comment.

How or why the military mortar ended up on the island is still unknown.
