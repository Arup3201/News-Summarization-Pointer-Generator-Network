Andrew Moss: He will be paid £80,000 a month for the next year

The boss of Britain’s biggest insurance company will continue to receive his salary of £80,000 a month for the next year despite his humiliating resignation yesterday.

Andrew Moss, who has quit as chief executive of Aviva after a shareholder revolt, will receive a golden goodbye worth around £1.75million in total.

Last Thursday, 59 per cent of shareholder votes failed to back his gold-plated pay package worth up to £5.2million last year.

It was the latest chapter in the growing backlash against boardroom greed, nicknamed the Shareholder Spring.

Yesterday the 54-year-old chief executive said he ‘felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership’.

But Mr Moss, who has also sparked public criticism for leaving his wife of 25 years and their four children for a junior married colleague, Deidre Galvin, in 2009, will not be leaving empty-handed.

He will be paid his £960,000 ‘basic’ annual salary for the next year, equal to £80,000 a month, unless he finds another job.

Mr Moss will also get a £300,000 bonus payment, a cash injection of £209,000 into his pension pot in five years’ time, deferred shares from a 2009 bonus, currently worth around £236,000, and a maximum of £45,000 in legal and other expenses.

He has two pensions from Aviva: one worth around £530,000 and one worth around £2.75million, including the £209,000 payment.

Mr Moss’s departure was announced on the eve of today’s Queen’s Speech, which is expected to fire the starting gun on a crackdown on boardroom excess and empower shareholders to veto any examples of corporate excess.

At present, shareholders can vote 
against pay deals, but their votes are not binding on the company and 
directors can still receive the controversial pay and bonuses.

The main 
role of such votes is to embarrass bosses and damage the firm’s 
reputation.

The mood of investors has turned ugly recently, triggering 
the departure of bosses at drugs company AstraZeneca and newspaper group
Trinity Mirror.

Yesterday, 
the chief executive of William Hill, Ralph Topping, was the latest 
victim, with nearly 50 per cent of the betting firm’s shareholders 
voting against a £1.2million bonus and a 8.3 per cent pay rise.

At its 
annual meeting, one angry shareholder said: ‘Chief executives are dining
in the last chance saloon trying to take as much as they can as soon as
possible.’

Business 
Secretary Vince Cable, who has heavily criticised boardroom excess, said
bosses are finally being ‘brought back to reality’.

He welcomed the 
‘uprising’ by shareholders as ‘a healthy development’, and said he is 
determined to stamp out ‘rewards for failure’.

Since
Mr Moss became chief executive in July 2007, Aviva’s share price has 
more than halved, decimating the nest eggs of thousands of its smaller 
shareholders.

Liberal Democrat
Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Shareholder votes must be binding, otherwise it 
just like a jury who acquit a man of a murder charge but the judge still
gives him 20 years. What’s the point?’

Deborah
Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre campaign group, said: ‘The irony is 
that Aviva was behind some of the recent pay revolts but, at the same 
time, they were not looking after their own backyard.

‘This
is what makes Mr Moss’s payoff so intolerable. Aviva’s corporate 
governance arm was lecturing others about pay and yet the company was 
ignoring its own advice.’

Mr 
Moss ceased to be chief executive ‘with immediate effect’ yesterday, but
he will not officially leave until the end of the month.

Meanwhile, the average pay of bosses at Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to £3.65million, according to research published yesterday.

The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the FTSE 100 index.

On average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus several other lucrative perks, according to the research. But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services.

The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time when inflation is 3.5 per cent.

The report found that 8 per cent of workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen.
