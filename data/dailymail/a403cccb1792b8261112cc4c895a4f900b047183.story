The claws are certainly out in one feline-filled household.

Cathy Wallis from Tuscon, Arizona, filmed the moment Lucifur the cat sprung a surprise attack on his housemate, Honey Boo Boo.

Footage shows his victim blissfully unaware that she's going to get pounced on as he lurks in a kitchen cupboard behind.

As the camera continues to roll Lucifur can be seen peering out of the cabinet and waving one paw in the air.

He appears to be judging the right time to strike. 

Finally, after much deliberation, the kitty springs out from his hiding place.

Honey Boo Boo lurches back in fear as her eye gets a beating.

The animals' owner reassured viewers that neither pets were hurt in the fray. 

She says that Lucifur is often up to no good and a bit of a troublemaker. 

Along with him and Honey Boo Boo, Wallis apparently owns 16 other cats and three dogs.

When they're not fighting, the cats' other favorite hobby appears to be sleeping judging by photos and videos uploaded to social media.
