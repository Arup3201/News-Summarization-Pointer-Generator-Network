It was the ranting of a mad woman': Max Clifford's daughter Louise leaves Southwark Crown Court in London, as her father's sex abuse trial continues

The daughter of Max Clifford today told a court that accusations in a letter written by one of his alleged victims were the 'rantings of a mad woman'.

Louise Clifford, 42, said the anonymous letter, which accused her father of assaulting a woman more than 35 years earlier, had been written by a 'very disturbed, malicious person'.

Southwark Crown Court has heard that the letter was written by a woman who claims to have been abused by the celebrity publicist after meeting him in Spain when she was 15 in 1977.

She is one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault in the trial.

Giving evidence today, Ms Clifford 
told the jury that she felt an 'atmosphere' when her father invited her 
to his office to read the letter.

'I knew something was amiss,' she said. 'He showed me and said I’ve received an anonymous letter.'

Asked
 by defence barrister Richard Horwell QC what her father’s reaction was 
to the letter, Ms Clifford said: 'He was just nonplussed. Completely 
bewildered by it. It was obviously disturbing.

'It was the ranting of a mad woman. That was my reaction.'

During
 cross-examination, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested to Ms 
Clifford that the letter reads as though it is written from 'someone 
hurt by your father'.

Ms Clifford replied: 'I think it reads like a very disturbed, malicious person.'

Ms
 Clifford, who suffered with juvenile chronic arthritis, said the 
condition played a 'significant factor' in her life when she was on 
holiday in Spain with her parents in 1983.

It
 was at this time Clifford is alleged to have put a 12-year-old girl’s 
hand on his penis when the youngster joined him and his daughter in a 
jacuzzi.

The woman is not a complainant in the case as the alleged offence took place abroad, the court has heard.

Ms Clifford denied the girl told her about the alleged incident after they had been in the jacuzzi together.

'It’s completely untrue. Utterly, utterly a lie,' she said.

'It didn’t happen.

'I would have been disturbed by it because it would have just been the most awful thing. It just didn’t happen.'

Ms Clifford said the allegation was 'very unpleasant'.

'I don’t remember (the woman) and she certainly didn’t come in the jacuzzi with us,' she added.

'If it happened to be true I would say it and say it.

'I would have been disturbed for life.'

The court heard Ms Clifford had worked with her father on a daily basis for the last 14 years.

Ms Cottage asked Ms Clifford whether her father had driven a 'wedge' between her and her mother.

Ms Clifford replied: 'He didn’t.'

'I would have been disturbed for life': Claims that Clifford had forced to 12-year-old girl to touch his penis while they shared a jacuzzi with his daughter were 'completely untrue. Utterly, utterly a lie,' said Miss Clifford

The witness confirmed Clifford had confessed to having an affair when she was 18 and in hospital.

'I absolutely think it didn’t come as a great shock to me because I think I had an inkling,' she said.

Asked whether Clifford was 'leading a double life', his daughter replied: 'It worked with his lifestyle easily. He certainly wasn’t living a double life.'

The trial continues: Clifford denies 11 charges of sexual assault against seven alleged victims

Ms Clifford told the court she had followed Twitter updates of the trial before today’s hearing but any suggestion she had lied in court was 'absolutely not true'.

'I would not been able to lie on oath,' she said.

'I’m not an actress. I have come here to tell the truth.'

Wearing a grey blazer and white shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, listened to the evidence with the aid of a hearing loop and smiled at his daughter as she left court.

He denies 11 charges of indecent assault against seven women and girls.

Earlier, a former winner of television talent show New Faces told the court he never saw Clifford, 70, 'get up to anything untoward'.

Singer Tom Waite said he worked with the PR guru after winning the ITV series in 1973 - beating pop band Showaddywaddy in the final - until the Eighties.

He said: 'I’ve got no problems with Max’s integrity or anything else.

'I just knew Max was a nice guy.

'I never saw him getting up to anything untoward.'

Mr Waite, who told the court he suffers from panic attacks, angrily denied lying for Clifford after he admitted speaking to his former manager before giving a statement to police in January last year.

'I’m getting angry about that actually because I don’t lie,' he said.

'If he’s done something wrong he deserves what’s coming to him.'

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. Clifford denies 11 charges of sexual assault against seven alleged victims.
