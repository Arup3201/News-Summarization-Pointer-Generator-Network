Sporting glasses and a pencil protector during high school really is a death sentence, according to a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. 

Though the marginalized adolescent brainiacs have oft been encouraged that success later in life can be their best revenge, a team of researchers found that social success in high school is actually key to making it in the real world.

A team of researchers tracked a group of students from high school to adulthood and found that those who were rated as popular retained their appeal in the marketplace and earned an average of 2 per cent more than their geeky counterparts.

Authors Gabriela Conti, from the 
Harris School of Public Policy at The University of Chicago, Gerrit 
Mueller from Germany's Institute of Employment Research, and University of Essex researchers Andrea Gaeotti and Stephen Pudney have concluded that over the years, being cool in school will pay off.

'We investigate these questions [about the impact of high school social standing] using an objective measure of popularity derived from sociometric theory: the number
of friendship nominations received from schoolmates, interpreted as a 
measure of early accumulation of personal social capital,' wrote the academics who authored the working paper, published in October.

In
the scientific quest to understand the impact of a high schooler's 
social standing, researchers looked at Wisconsin's Longitudinal Study, a
survey that has tracked a group of students in the Badger State who 
graduated in 1957.

The 
study has monitored this population of roughly 10,000 and reviewed their progress over the course
of 35 years.

After
tracking this group through the years, the cool kids still stood out among 
the crowd, earning an estimated 2 per cent more than their less cool 
compadres.

To measure popularity, researchers had respondents list three students they considered to be their closest friends.

Researchers reviewed the answers and the names most frequently listed were considered to be the most popular from the group.

'Popularity as measured by the number 
of friendship nominations that the student receives from his school 
mates has a sizable effect... consistent with our view, we interpret 
our measure of popularity as a measure of the stock of social skills of a
particular individual,' the researchers wrote.

'If Paul nominates John as his friend, he reveals his affection towards John. In receiving a claim of friendship, John is socially approved by Paul. We can then distinguish students on the basis of the number of friendship nominations they give.'

They found some trends 
among this elite group. The cool kids tended to come from 'warm family 
environments,' they actually excelled at school and contrary to conventional wisdom that being brainy is a turn off, intelligence was part of their allure.

The research also found that if an individual moved from the 20th percentile of popular to the 80th percentile, that could provide a salary that was 10 per cent higher, over the course of 40 years.

Popularity was found to be a key factor in this determination, even after accounting for a person's family background, school quality, cognitive ability and adult personality traits.

The popularity 
factor seemed to give a student a leg up in the real world because 
it was the training needed 'to be socially adequate for the successful 
performance of their adult roles,' the authors concluded.

has openly detailed her awkward and nerdy childhood and turned the 
experience into comedy gold. The '30 Rock' star (right) on the red

Inspiration: Tina Fey relied on her experience as a nerd to pen the script for the hilarious comedy 'Mean Girls,' (from left to right) actresses Lacey Chabert, Rachel McAdams, Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried

But an awkward adolescence can actually be a badge of honor in some circles.

For those in showbiz and comedy, many have found success in coming clean 
about their geeky phase.

Former
'Saturday Night Live' star, actress and screenwriter Tina Fey has 
channeled her embarrassing early years into much of her material and has
wrote extensively about being an outcast and a late bloomer.

Fey, 42, was inspired by her experience to adapt Rosalind Wiseman's book 
'Queen Bees and Wannabes' into the script for 'Mean Girls,' the 
hilariously popular 2004 high school comedy starring Lindsay Lohan about
the high school pecking order.

In her book 'Bossypants,' she even boasts about her nerdy childhood and jokes about how that experience gave her a biting wit to laugh at the creme de la creme. 

Late bloomer: Actress Mindy Kaling (left as a 
child) has blossomed into a successful star (right, at the Critics' 
Choice Movie Award in January) and pokes fun of her childhood dorkiness 
in her comedy material

Similarly, Mindy Kaling, who wrote 
for and appeared in 'The Office' and now stars in FOX's 'The Mindy 
Project,' has joked about her youthful days of being quiet, studious and
isolated.

The 33-year-old actually 
credits her dorkiness with helping her later in life, in her new book 
'Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns).' 

'Teenage girls, please don’t worry 
about being super popular in high school, or being the best actress in 
high school, or the best athlete.'

'Not only do people not care about any
of that the second you graduate, but when you get older, if you 
reference your successes in high school too much, it actually makes you 
look kind of pitiful, like some babbling old Tennessee Williams 
character with nothing else going on in her current life. What I’ve 
noticed is that almost no one who was a big star in high school is also 
big star later in life. For us overlooked kids, it’s so wonderfully 
fair,' she promises.

So there is hope...
