Shaun Murphy's mum Jean and fiancee Elaine picked the right week to start watching him play.

Murphy has been a professional snooker player for 17 years but they had never seen him compete live until now, breaking the habit of a lifetime to witness him complete a career ‘triple crown’ with a masterclass win over world No 1 Neil Robertson.

‘I’ve told them it’s not always like this,’ said Murphy after sealing a 10-2 victory to take the Masters title at London’s Alexandra Palace.

The 32-year-old became only the 10th man in history to win the World, Masters and UK championships after the most commanding performance at this event since Steve Davis beat Mike Hallett 9-0 in the 1998 final.

It is a decade since Murphy won the World Championship. He added a UK title in 2008 but despite being one of the most naturally talented ball strikers, this final piece of the puzzle had eluded him.

‘After winning the world title as a 22-year-old, I thought I’d blitz through these events, but I’ve had ups and downs,’ said Murphy. ‘This time last year I thought about walking away from snooker altogether.’

It was vital Robertson got off the mark quickly at the start of the second session but instead Murphy won the first frame.

Murphy recorded his second century of the game with a superb 127 to extend his lead to 9-2 and put the title beyond Robertson.

‘I came to this event when I was 12. My dad asked if I felt I’d ever play in it and I said I’d love to. Winning it is unbelievable,’ said Murphy.

If he keeps playing like this he will be a major contender at the World Championship in May, and it was announced yesterday that the event will remain at The Crucible in Sheffield until at least 2017.

Stephen Hendry, the record seven-time world champion, praised the decision. ‘I can’t imagine the World Championship anywhere else. It would just lack something, and it wouldn’t feel like the World Championship any more,’ he said. ‘It would be like taking the tennis away from Wimbledon. There is only one place truly to play snooker, and that is The Crucible.’
