Schools, hospitals and prisons should buy British food even if it is more expensive, new Government guidelines will say.

Current rules which make price the overriding factor in public sector purchasing will be scrapped this summer.

They will be replaced by new guidance designed to boost British agriculture and improve quality, under which public bodies will be obliged to prioritise other factors, including local sourcing.

Hospitals and schools will be encouraged to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source

The public sector currently spends £2.1billion a year on food, and the Government is keen to reduce foreign imports and boost farming.

Britain imports 40 per cent of its food - including many products which could be produced domestically.

Farming Minister George Eustice told the Daily Mail: ‘The Government spends more than £2billion on food and we’re keen to improve procurement so that British agriculture gets a proper shot at that business.

‘Price is clearly an important factor that needs to be taken into account, but it won’t be the overriding factor.

‘If you have better food, wholesome food, produced to a better standard, that is the kind of thing people who are doing the buying should be weighing up.

‘We don’t think it should necessarily be that much more expensive.’

The current Government Buying Standards document emphasises the importance of quality, locality and animal welfare - but it includes an overarching rule which says the cost of food trumps all other factors.

That rule will be taken out of the guidelines when they are reissued in the summer, Mr Eustice said.

The move follows an impassioned plea in January by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson for families to cut down on foreign food. He was then challenged by the National Farmers’ Union to push hospitals and schools to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source.

At the time Peter Kendall, then NFU president said: ‘If Owen Paterson is going to get the public to buy British then he should also get the Government to buy British. We had an event at the House of Commons in May last year and they could not come up with an entirely British menu for us.’

Last night  Phil Hudson, head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union, said: ‘Finally the Government is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to British agriculture.

‘We have campaigned against the Government caveat that food can be sourced locally, as long as it isn’t more expensive.

‘If the minister is saying that caveat will be removed, that is very positive news.’

Conservative MP Neil Parish, who sits on the Rural Affairs Select Committee, said British farming needed a boost after a terrible winter of floods and storms.

‘This is very good news,’ he said. ‘Farming needs to be supported when we have had these weather extremes.‘What is also key is that we don’t want to be reliant on food imports from abroad.’

Last month Environment Secretary Owen Paterson appointed Peter Bonfield, who led the procurement strategy for the 2012 London Olympics, to carry out a review of the Government Buying Standards document. He will report back in July.

A stumbling block to the drive for British-grown food includes an anti-protectionist EU directive which does not allow public bodies to simply favour products from their own country.

But Mr Eustice said there are easy ways to ‘navigate’ the directive.

The minister, who himself comes from a farming background, said: ‘You can’t just say “you have to only buy British” but you can say that publicly-procured food should comply with certain standards, standards that are consistent with welfare standards here in the UK.

‘You can look at whether the food is seasonal, whether it is local, you can look at the length of journey it has had, the impact on the environment, the impact on the benefit to local communities of food being sourced locally.

‘And you can in some circumstances include the social benefits locally. You can have a more balanced approach to procurement, that do not favour the massive companies that operate on a pan-European basis but that factor in smaller suppliers.

‘It’s about trying to get the balance right.

‘That is what we have to try to navigate through.’

He added: ‘Sometimes local authorities, for example, can get rather spooked by EU procurement law. We are keen to have a close look at EU law and see if we can work around that.’

Farming bosses say supermarkets also need to play their part by stocking more British food.

A poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of the NFU said 79 per cent of shoppers want to see more locally-sourced food on shop shelves.

Former NFU president Peter Kendall, who this week ended his eight-year term at the union, said: ‘I’m constantly told by some supermarkets that their sourcing policies are determined by what their customers want. This survey shows very clearly that consumers want more British food, so I hope they will take this on board and act on it.

‘We’re not saying that supermarkets should not stock any foreign produce. But we would urge the retailers to listen to what consumers are saying.

‘British farmers and growers provide some of the highest quality produce in the world produced to high standards of quality, welfare and traceability and consumers want to buy it.’

The Mail revealed last month that quarter of food imported into Britain could be produced on home soil.

Some 81 per cent of tomatoes consumed in Britain are foreign-grown, as are 59 per cent of mushrooms.

Just 30 per cent of cucumbers are grown here, down from 55 per cent 14 years ago.
