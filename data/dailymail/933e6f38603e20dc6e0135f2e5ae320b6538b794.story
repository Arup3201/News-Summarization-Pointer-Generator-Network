A firefighter has been arrested for insurance fraud after he allegedly moonlighted as a mixed martial arts fighter while on sick leave.

Raphael Davis, 35, reportedly claimed $30,000 benefits from the Los Angeles Fire Department between 2008 and 2011 because he was too injured to work - while he continued to compete in the brutal sport under the name 'The Noodle'.

He was charged with four felony counts of insurance fraud and held on $30,000 bail according to a report from the LA District Attorney's office.

Authorities refused to reveal details of the injuries Davis suffered from. The Los Angeles Fire Department had yet to respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

If he is found guilty, Davis, a married father from Lomita, California, faced five years in prison.

According to mixed martial arts websites, Davis is 6ft 3inches and weighs 203 pounds. In his last 14 fights, between 2006 and March 24 this year, he has won 12 out of 14 matches.

Davis's Facebook profile is filled with his fighting exploits - along with him dressed in his firefighter's uniform and sitting on a fire truck.

According to mixedmartialartsuniverse.com, payouts in the global Ultimate Fighting Championships can range from $350,000 at the top end of the sport to several thousand dollars for lower-ranked competitors.

Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full contact sport that uses both striking and grappling techniques and draws moves from boxing, wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, muay Thai, kickboxing, taekwondo, karate and judo.

Although the rate of injury in the combat sport is roughly the same as boxing, two fighters died in 2007 and 2010.
