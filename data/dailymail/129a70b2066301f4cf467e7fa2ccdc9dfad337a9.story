In scenes reminiscent of the MH370 disaster four months ago, sobbing relatives of passengers travelling on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 have gathered at airports in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur to learn the fate of their missing loved ones.

Clutching the side of an escalator for support, one man weeps after finding out the fate of his relative at an information point set up at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where the doomed plane took off from at lunchtime today.

At Kuala Lumpur International Airport, where flight MH 17 was due to land shortly after 6am local time on Friday morning, women cry into tissues as they hear about the fate of their loved ones.

Up to 100 children were thought to be among the 283 passengers and 15 crew who died when the plane was shot down in an 'act of terrorism' on the Russia-Ukraine border.

Nine British passengers are among the 298 feared dead after a 
Malaysian Airlines plane was 'shot down' on the Russia-Ukraine border, according to Dutch authorities.

There were are fears that there were up to 23 Americans on the flight, though it has yet to be confirmed that any were on board.

In
 one image taken from the crash site, a pile of passports can be seen 
scattered amid the rubble.

Witnesses say body parts are scattered over a distance of 15km, suggesting the plane broke up in mid-air.

As
 shocking images emerged of bodies amid the smouldering wreckage of the 
Boeing 777 it raised concerns of renewed tension between the US and 
Russia.

Emergency workers are seen tackling the blazes that broke out after the aircraft crashed near Donestsk, where pro-Russian rebels have been fighting Ukrainian government forces.

TV pictures from the scene showed a pall of smoke billowing into the sky apparently from the stricken aircraft.

Among those feared dead is a Dutch man who posted a photo on Facebook of the plane on the tarmac just hours before the crash.

Initially,
 friends commented on the photo wishing him happy holidays. But their 
messages turned to ones of concern once news of the crash broke.

Based
 on the number of flights leaving Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, and the 
timing of his Facebook status, it is feared he was on the fated flight.

His
 cousin later posted the flight number beneath the picture and shortly 
after friends began leaving messages saying 'rest in peace'.

Another said that his girlfriend was on the flight with him.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I'm 
shocked and saddened by the Malaysian air disaster. Officials from 
across Whitehall are meeting to establish the facts.'

In a statement on Thursday night Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘We do believe that there were British Nationals on board the flight we’re currently working through passenger data cross checking it and referencing it to establish exactly the numbers and identities of those British nationals and as soon as we have further information we will be in contact with the families.’

It is believed the plane was struck by BUK surface-to-air missile at 33,000ft around 20 miles before entering Russian airspace.

A spokesman from the Foreign Office would not be drawn on whether any British nationals had been on board the plane.

‘We are aware of the reports and are urgently working to establish what has happened,’ he said.

Asked
 about reports that up to 10 British people had been on board, the 
spokesman added: ‘Our first priority is to establish if there are any 
British persons on board but we are not in a position to go beyond that 
line.’

David 
Cameron has summoned officials from across Whitehall for urgent talks at
 7pm to discuss the latest on the crash, and what is known about any 
British casualties.

The
 Foreign Office is in talks with consular teams in Amsterdam and Kuala 
Lumpur to obtain passenger lists to establish how many UK nationals were 
on board.

Malaysian Airlines said they have no information about any survivors.

In
 a tweet, the airline said: 'Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 
from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. 
More details to follow.'

A
 Boeing spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with those on 
board the Malaysia Airlines airplane lost over Ukrainian airspace, as 
well as their families and loved ones.

'Boeing stands ready to provide whatever assistance is requested by authorities.'

The
 jet would have been flying at high altitude on an intercontinental 
flight that took it over the crisis hit region of Ukraine, where the 
authorities have accused Russia-backed separatists of previous attacks 
on aircraft.

The crash comes four months after the 
mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is 
thought to have crashed into the Indian Ocean.

Two
 weeks ago, investigators say what little evidence they have to work 
with suggests the plane was deliberately diverted thousands of 
kilometres from its scheduled route before eventually plunging into the 
Indian Ocean.

The search was
 narrowed in April after a series of acoustic pings thought to be from 
the plane's black box recorders were heard along a final arc where 
analysis of satellite data put its last location.
