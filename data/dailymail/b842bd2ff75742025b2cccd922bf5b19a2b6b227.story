Ronald de Boer believes his brother Frank would now be interested in becoming Liverpool manager - after turning down the job two years ago.

The scrutiny around Brendan Rodgers' safety as boss at Anfield is intensifying following his side's crushing 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday and their Champions League exit last week.

De Boer has impressed since taking over at Ajax in 2010, developing a ruthless winning streak in his first managerial role.

Frank de Boer has an imperious record as Ajax manager:

Played: 171

Wins: 101

Drawn: 40

Lost: 30

Honours: Eredivisie (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014), Dutch Super Cub (2013)

In April, he became the first man to win four straight Eredivisie titles, and achieved the feat with a core of young players integrated into the first team through the club's world renowned academy.

'If Liverpool come now he would certainly think about it,' De Boer's brother Ronald said to Fox Sports. 

'He would certainly not close the door immediately, like he did two years ago.'

Liverpool are currently languishing in tenth position in the Premier League and have already lost seven games this season.

Rodgers takes his side to Championship high-flyers Bournemouth on Wednesday in the Capital One Cup quarter-final before facing Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday in a must-win encounter.
