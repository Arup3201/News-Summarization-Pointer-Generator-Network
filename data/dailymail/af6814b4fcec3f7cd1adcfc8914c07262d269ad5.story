Bad Boy Of Ballroom: Maksim Chmerkovskiy has quit Dancing With The Stars

Maksim Chmerkovskiy has quit Dancing With The Stars.

The Latin ballroom dancing champion and choreographer, 33, joined the show during its second season in 2006. His celebrity dance partners have included Kirstie Alley, Laila Ali and Mel B.

The Bad Boy Of Ballroom - a nickname given to the star for his fiery personality and loud mouth - wants to pursue acting.

His public resignation came as ABC announced the new season line-up of contestants, which will include Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills castmember Lisa Vanderpump, country legend Wynonna Judd and American Idol runner up Kellie Pickler.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Maksim confirmed speculation he would be hanging up his dancing shoes, telling Life&Style: 'I just want to set the record straight to all of my amazing fans that I will unfortunately not be returning for this season of Dancing With the Stars.

'I’ve been a pro dancer on the show 
for about seven years now and am eager to explore other opportunities 
that have been made possible because of Dancing With the Stars. I'm 
going to take this time to dive into producing and acting, while 
fulfilling my sponsorship obligations.'

"A big thank you to all of my fans 
for your never-ending support," he continues. "I also want to thank the 
entire cast and production of Dancing with the Stars.'

A spokesperson for ABC said: 'We 
frequently rotate the professional dancers, so it is not unusual for 
them to rest a cycle. As we consider who will be matched up each season,
there are a lot of factors that dictate which couples make the best 
pairings.

'We appreciate each of our dancers 
dedication to the show, so this is a very difficult decision. Anna, 
Chelsie, Maks and Louis continue to be a part of the Dancing With the 
Stars family.'

He knows what he's doing: The 33-year-old, pictured here with partner Denise Richards, is a Latin ballroom dancing champion and choreographer

Maksim is likely hoping to emulate 
his ex-colleague Julianne, who has managed to carve out a successful 
acting career for herself in films like Rock of Ages and the new romance
flick Safe Haven.

He
has appeared on the Ukrainian version of The Bachelor and is said to 
have landed the lead role of a dancer in a romantic comedy that begins 
shooting this year.

'I
never thought I was ready [for movie acting]. Then I had a whole day of
reading with the director and casting director, and I enjoyed it so 
much,' Maksim told the New York Post recently. 'I caught the bug, as they say. 
This is something I really want to do.'
