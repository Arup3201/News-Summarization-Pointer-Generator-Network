The number of man-hours lost through strikes has almost doubled in the last year as workers ranging from midwives to firefighters took part in walkouts.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show 782,000 days were lost because of labour disputes in the year to October, compared with 405,000 a year earlier.

There were 27 stoppages in October alone, involving 109,000 workers.

Suggesting a rise in industrial militancy, 745,000 workers were involved in the strikes in the last year, more than twice as many as in 2013.

This included a strike over pay involving hundreds of thousands of nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and ambulance drivers.

Even the Royal College of Midwives took part in the walkout in the organisation’s first strike in its 133-year history.

Scans and home visits for expectant mothers were delayed, while dozens of less-urgent 999 calls went unattended by paramedics.

Members of the Unite union alone have been involved in more than 150 days of strike action in 2014, an increase of a quarter on last year.

This does not even include disputes which have not been resolved or are looming.

Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of Unite, said strike action had risen because working people have simply ‘had enough’.

He said: ‘They have had enough of a failed, ideological economic strategy of austerity, real term pay cuts, rising costs and little hope.

‘The only growth experienced by most workers is a devastating growth in poverty and food-banks supporting the most vulnerable while everyday costs in rip-off Britain such as rent, transport, food and energy force more into debt and often, despair.

‘People are rightly outraged when they see the richest in society pocket millions in wage hikes, bonuses, share options and pension pots, much of which appears to be whisked away to the nearest tax haven rather than being spent in the local economy to support jobs and businesses.’

Mr Turner indicated that industrial unrest will continue into the new year and even leading up to the general election.

Several high profile disputes remain unresolved, including those in the NHS, fire service and civil service, as well as in the private sector.

Thousands of workers in organisations ranging from defence firms and libraries to a homeless charity were also involved in industrial disputes in 2014, while bus drivers in London are among those gearing up for action in the new year.

Most of the disputes are now about pay, however, others have centred around pensions, working conditions and job cuts.

It comes as the Trades Union Congress claimed wages had fallen by about £2,509 for the average employee since 2010, when adjusted for inflation.

Frances O’Grady, of the TUC, said: ‘Government, employers and unions must work together to promote wage led growth.

‘This means increasing pay for those at the bottom with a higher minimum wage and spreading the living wage.’

However, most British workers are finally starting to benefit from above-inflation pay rises, figures showed this month.

ONS data showed that wages excluding bonuses are 1.6 per cent higher than last year, while the cost of goods has risen by just one per cent.
