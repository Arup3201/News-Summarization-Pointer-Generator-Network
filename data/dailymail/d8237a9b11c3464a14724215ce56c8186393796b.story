Nick Clegg yesterday announced plans for an £8 billion tax hike after the election, as he laid the groundwork for a coalition with Labour.

In a significant shift towards Labour’s position, Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would pursue a higher ratio of tax rises to spending cuts if they find themselves still in power again after the election.

He said this would involve ‘at least’ £8 billion in tax rises, more than half of which have yet to be set out.

David Cameron condemned the move, saying it would hit millions of ordinary families. But the shift opens the door to a potential post-election deal with Ed Miliband, who is also expected to raise taxes and reduce the pace of spending cuts if he wins power in May.

The coalition has pursued a deficit reduction programme comprising 80 per cent spending and welfare cuts and 20 per cent tax rises.

But the new Lib Dem plans will see that shift to 60 per cent cuts and 40 per cent tax rises after the election.

The Conservatives want to clear the remaining budget deficit entirely through cuts to spending and benefits. Mr Clegg yesterday dismissed the Tory plans as ‘implausible and undeliverable’.

Speaking at the Shangri La Hotel on the 52nd floor of the Shard building in London, Mr Clegg said his party’s ‘sensible, balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society.

‘Austerity should only be a means to an end - and the end is in sight,’ he said.

Mr Clegg insisted that the planned tax rises would not hit those on low and middle incomes, and would not involve a rise in the headline rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.

But speaking at a campaign event in Leeds, Mr Cameron dismissed the Lib Dem proposals, warning that they would hit ‘hard-working people’.

‘I don’t think it is right to have a plan that involves really quite substantial tax increases that would hit hard working people,” he said.

‘I think that what we need now is a plan that the Conservative Party has set out which is to eradicate the remaining deficit, to start putting money aside during years of growth for a rainy day.’

The Lib Dem shift came as a new analysis found the party now shares almost 100 policies, fuelling speculation that they are plotting a post-election Coalition.

Agreement over major issues such as the mansion tax, votes at 16 and a green light for further government borrowing would make it easier for Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg to come to a deal in May.

A commitment to implement in full the draconian recommendations of the Leveson Report into press regulation is also shared between the two leaders’ parties – as is a commitment to sex and relationship education in schools.

The analysis by the Fabian Society and Centre Forum, two think tanks, suggests that agreement between Labour and the Lib Dems may be significantly easier than between the Tories and the Lib Dems.

The two organisations, which are close to the respective parties, has identified 97 areas of agreement in their joint report, ‘Common Ground?’.

These include fiscal rules which permit the government to borrow billions more, a mansion tax for properties over £2million, decarbonising the power sector by 2030, and major devolution of power and money to English councils.

Other shared priorities include more free childcare for children under five, greater control over free schools and academies, the construction of at least 200,000 new homes a year, and restrictions on access to some benefits for EU migrants while supporting international students.

The two parties also agree on a higher minimum wage, withdrawal of the winter fuel payment from the richest pensioners, votes at 16 and a commitment that the UK should ‘remain a committed member of the EU’ and of the European Convention on Human Rights.
