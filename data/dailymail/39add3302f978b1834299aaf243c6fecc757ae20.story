It is still seen as a carefree time of innovation, peace, fashion and great music.

So it is no surprise that the Sixties has been chosen as the best decade in history.

One third of Britons say they would rather be living in the Swinging Sixties than in today’s trouble-torn world, saying it was an ‘age of change for the better’.

Carnaby Street, 1968: One third of Britons say they would rather be living in the Swinging Sixties

Ironically, though, the majority of the 2,000 people aged 18 to 60 who were polled are far too young to remember the era.

Two thirds said there was ‘greater optimism’ in the Sixties than today, despite the Cold War tensions of the time. Only 17 per cent said they would prefer to be living in the Seventies and 10 per cent chose the Fifties.

The Sixties topped the poll in every category, from memorable events to music and films.

Asked to pick their top three ‘defining moments’ of the decade, 63 per cent chose Neil Armstrong becoming the first man on the moon in 1969 followed by the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963 and the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King. 

The events, all of which occurred in the US, beat England winning the World Cup in 1966, chosen by 47 per cent, and The Beatles cutting their first single in 1962.

When it came to naming the best Sixties record, The Beatles took four of the top five places with She Loves You, Can’t Buy Me Love, I Want To Hold Your Hand and We Can Work It Out, with Elvis Presley’s It’s Now Or Never at number four.

The best movie was Mary Poppins, beating The Sound Of Music, Psycho, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid and Doctor Zhivago. 

Marilyn Monroe was voted the decade’s greatest female icon, with Elvis Presley greatest male icon. 

The poll was conducted to mark the start of a ten-part documentary series, The Sixties, on the Yesterday TV channel tonight.

Adrian Wills, general manager of Yesterday, said: ‘Regardless of whether we were around in the 1960s or not, Brits tend to have a real sense of nostalgia when it comes to the music and the history surrounding that era. 

'Few decades have had the breadth of impact. The events of that period transformed the world.’
