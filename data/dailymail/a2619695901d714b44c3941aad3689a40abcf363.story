Just over a year ago, Sian Clarke weighted just three and a half stone and nearly died of a cardiac arrest.

The 20-year-old, from Solihull, was battling anorexia so severe  her own mother considered planning her funeral.

With a BMI of just nine, she was moved between six hospitals in less than a year – including to a secure ward with very unwell and violent patients.

But none of the facilities seemed able to treat her illness, prompting her mother to accuse the NHS of 'leaving her to die'.

But now Miss Clarke is on the road to recovery, planning her 21st birthday party and acting as a mentor to others with eating disorders. 

Sian Clarke, 20, has battled anorexia since she was 15 and bullied at school. In June 2013, she suffered a cardiac arrest and nearly died. Now, after a course of treatment, she is on the road to recovery and is mentoring other people with eating disorders

Miss Clarke, pictured here in hospital, has been treated at six different hospitals since 2012. Her mother says the NHS 'left her to die' and that she received 'appalling care'

After her cardiac arrest, Miss Clarke was put on a course of treatment and is on the road to recovery. She is staying at Beverley House, a mental health centre in Birmingham, but hopes to move back home soon

Miss Clarke first developed an eating disorder at 15 years old.

She was being bullied at school and couldn't cope with it, and started worrying about her weight.

Things went from bad to worse and she spent much of her teens in and out of treatment centres.

But doctors struggled to find her the appropriate way to help her - and her weight continued to drop to dangerous levels.

In October 2012, she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

This led to her being passed between six different hospitals for treatment - a move her mother Denise calls 'appalling'.

Mrs Clarke, 41, said: 'It's no joke to say that I would be planning her funeral now if she hadn't finally made it to the centre that helped her. It's shocking, and I'm absolutely appalled.

'The NHS has got a lot to answer for. This is somebody's life - but everyone seems to blame someone else.'

In October 2012, Miss Clarke was was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. This led to her being passed between many hospitals for treatment - a move her mother Denise has described previously as 'appalling'

'Sian was left to die. She was passed between different hospitals, and none of them could treat her anorexia.

'The doctors told me that she was on the brink of death.'

In June 2013, when Miss Clarke was 19 and being treated at the Cygnet Hospital in Derby, she went into cardiac arrest.

This is where the heart stops pumping blood around the body – usually because the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead.

Miss Clarke collapsed and stopped breathing - a moment her mother described as 'hell'.

'I would say to those who are going through the same thing: you have to believe in yourself. You can beat this thing,' Miss Clarke said. She is pictured in hospital with her mother Denise 

At one point, Mrs Clarke, 41, began planning her daughter's funeral. But now mother and daughter are now  planning Sian's 21st birthday party instead

'It's a mother's worst nightmare. She was so close to death,' said Mrs Clarke. 

'We had a bedside vigil and I started thinking I would have to start planning her funeral.

'I could easily be visiting her grave now.'

Miss Clarke was rushed to the Derby Royal Hospital, where she underwent emergency treatment.

She had a BMI (Body Mass Index) of just nine and was not expected to live.

The typical BMI for a healthy 19-year-old girl ranges from 18 to 26.

'No-one should technically be alive at three-and-a-half stone,' her mother said.

'Sian was so emaciated you could see every bone, and her teeth were protruding out of her mouth.'

Anorexia can lead to a life-threatening cardiac arrest because the heart needs adequate amounts of potassium, sodium and other electrolytes in a certain balance.

Miss Clarke now wants to raise as much awareness to anorexia as possible, including posting this striking image of herself on Facebook

Starving the body depletes these electrolyte and the electrical activity of the heart is interrupted, leading to heart rhythm problems or cardiac arrest. 

Miss Clarke was put on a course of treatment and gradually started to get well.

While she has not fully recovered, Miss Clarke hopes to return home from the treatment centre soon.

And grateful at being given the chance to live, she now wants to help others with eating disorders recover.

Her mother said: 'Sian says to me now "Mum this can't happen to anyone else".'

In order to raise awareness, she has put a striking image of herself, leaning over a toilet, on Facebook.

The accompanying message reads: 'A struggle is an easy thing to mistake for attention.

'You can't see it by merely looking at someone, or even begin to know what happens behind closed doors.

'The pain, anguish, torment and overall, the fight. Stand up to eating disorders.'

She also helps to mentor other people with anorexia, and has been awarded a national Service Users Award.

'I feel great,' Miss Clarke said. 'Don't get me wrong, I have my off days.

'There are times when I get on the scales and think: "What have I done?"

'This illness has taken over my life since I was 15 years old. I have not been able to live a normal life.

'I would say to those who are going through the same thing: you have to believe in yourself.

'You have to focus on the reason you are doing what you are doing.

'You can beat this thing.'

A spokesperson for NHS England (West Midlands), who are responsible for Miss Clarke's care, said: 'We are committed to ensuring that patients have access to safe, effective and high-quality mental health services.

'An investigation into the care and treatment of this patient has taken place and a full response has been shared with the parents and family.

'If there are any further concerns, we would encourage the family to contact us to discuss them further.

'NHS England takes complaints very seriously and regrets that on this occasion the patient was unhappy with the care and treatment that they received.'
