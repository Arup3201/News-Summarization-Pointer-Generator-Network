Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma has revealed he has dreams of winning the Ballon d'Or.

Zouma has impressed at the heart of the Chelsea defence this season and proved his versatility by seemlessly switching into a holding midfield role when called upon this term.

And while his career remains firmly in its infancy, he hopes he can emulate the likes of his compatriot, World Cup winner Marcel Desailly.

Speaking to Canal+, he said: 'I think about it. It is a dream for me. I am somebody who dreams.

‘I am often compared with Marcel Desailly, but he, he made a great career.

‘He is a football legend. He did a lot of big games. I have only just arrived on the scene and I have a lot to prove.’

Zouma, 20, joined the Blues in January 2014 after making 73 appearances for Ligue 1 outfit Saint-Etienne.

But he claims he has no regrets over leaving his native France so early in his career.

He said: 'I do not regret it at all, because it is the club that I always liked. I did not play a lot at the start but now, it is starting to go better and I am very happy.'
