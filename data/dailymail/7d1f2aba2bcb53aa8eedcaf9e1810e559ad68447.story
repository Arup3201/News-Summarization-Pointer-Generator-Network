A hotel in a wild west gold mining town in West Australia will now allow travelers to settle bills for accommodation with gold.

The Rydges Resort and Spa in Kalgoorlie, 600km east of Perth, will start accepting nuggets, bars and 'anything as long as it's gold'.

Resort manager Nicholas Parkinson-Bates said it made sense to accept gold transactions in the goldfields.

'Everyone here knows the value of gold - it's sort of a way of life in Kalgoorlie,' Mr Parkinson-Bates told AAP.

'There are a number of corporates who do use gold or get paid in gold. People buy cars in gold here.

'I've also heard of some other types of businesses even doctors and stuff who have been accepting gold.'

The idea to allow people to pay for a room with the precious metal was inspired by the Diggers and Dealers Mining Forum to be held in August.

But Mr Parkinson-Bates said he was keen to extend the payment method for life.

He said the gold transactions would be carried out through a local buyer with connections to Perth Mint, the ABC reports.

'Guests who do want to use their gold will come to us and we will weigh it and I then contact the buyer and they give us an 80-85 per cent value on that gold and then I will tell the customer "your gold is worth X amount",' he said.

'I will still take a credit card to hold for any extras the guests may spend and I will get cash from the gold trader in town.'

Mr Parkinson-Bates said no-one had paid the hotel in gold yet and he wasn't expecting a sudden influx of people wanting to pay with that method.

'I'm not expecting it's going to be today or tomorrow but we want to provide that service, we are in Kalgoorlie, we're in the gold capital of Australia, we should be doing this,' he said.

Mr Parkinson-Bates said it was about time Kalgoorlie, the gold capital of Australia, started making gold payments available
