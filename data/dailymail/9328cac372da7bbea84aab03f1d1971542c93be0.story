Billie-Jean Biria didn't plan to hike more than a half mile on September 18 when she took her 10-month-old son Shadan and two dogs to search for her son's missing red beanie.

But the 34-year-old mother lost her way and couldn't find her way back to her husband's hunting camp near Beaver Marsh, Oregon.

Twenty-one hours later, after spending the night in a hollowed out tree, she was rescued thanks to help of about 50 volunteers.

Lost and found: Billie-Jean Biria (above) got lost in the woods of Southern Oregon last month while looking for a lost hat with her 10-month-old son Shadan

Moved by all the people that came out to find her and her young son, Mrs Biria is now training to volunteer on similar search-and-rescue operations.

Mrs Biria was reported missing around 4:30 the afternoon of September 18.

She says that when she finally found her son's beanie, she turned around and lost site of camp.

'I took for granted I knew where I was going,' she told the Herald and News.

So she had the dogs sniff their way back to the camp, but eventually realized they were just sniffing the scents of the forest. Her surroundings became more unfamiliar and she knew she was just drifting further away from camp.

As it became dark, Mrs Biria found shelter in a hollowed-out tree. She curled up and warmed her son underneath her shirt to wait for morning.

'At no point was I scared,' she said. 'I think my maternal instincts kicked in'.

At first light, Mrs Biria tried walking up hill to look for a road. At one point she heard a helicopter pass overhead, but couldn't get the pilot's attention.

She was finally rescued later that afternoon when she heard her husband's truck and started in the direction of the noise where she found camp. In an interesting twist, it was right after hearing her husband's truck that she lost the red beanie yet again. This time, she didn't go back for it.

It was back at camp that she saw the massive effort that was organized to search for her. She estimates that there were 50 or 60 people out combing the woods.

Paying it forward: After seeing the large group of volunteers that put in the time to look for her, Mrs Biria decided to train to become a search-and-rescue volunteer herself

'I didn't know I was such a big deal,' she said. 'It was a lot of people. I was amazed and thankful'.

According to Klamath County Sheriff Sgt Randall Swan, a smaller group of local volunteers spent the night looking for Mrs Biria, but when they were unsuccessful they called in volunteers from California and other regional counties.

'We call it pushing the big button,' Sgt Swan said.

Inspired by all the people who took the time to search for her, Mrs Biria is currently training to be a search-and-rescue volunteer herself. She attended a rescue academy last weekend.
