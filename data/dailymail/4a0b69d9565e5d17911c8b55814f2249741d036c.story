A mother and her nine-year-old daughter are fighting for life after both being struck down with the same potentially-fatal tumour condition.

Anna Hillman, 33, contracted cavernoma - clusters of abnormal blood vessels - just three months after her daughter Madi was diagnosed with the condition for the second time.

The brave schoolgirl is now fighting for survival yet again after the condition, which is extremely rare in children, left her with a tumour on her brain stem.

Anna Hillman, 33, and her daughter Madison, 9, are both are suffering from the rare and potentially fatal condition cavernoma

The condition, called brain stem genetic cavernoma, causes oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or seizures

The mother and daughter describe their condition as a 'ticking time bomb' because neither know what their outcome will be.

Mrs Hillman, a horse breeder, said: 'It is an extremely rare condition, particularly in children. Madi is now in a position where she will either die or they will operate, obviously we hope it is the latter.

'We are in a position where, when it gets bigger to about 3cm, she dies [from a haemorrhage]. At the moment it is small, but essentially, Madi is a ticking time bomb.

'As for me, I know I have at least one tumour in my temple lobe which is a dangerous place to have them, and I have one growing at the back of my head.

'The symptoms include seizures and strokes, so I know at some point I will experience that, I already quite often wake up with my left side is numb.'

The condition is genetic, meaning that Madi's three siblings, Jack, 14, Georgia, seven, and Charlie, two, will also have to undergo brain scans. They have a 50 per cent chance of developing the condition

Madi was first diagnosed with the brain 
stem genetic cavernoma, which causes oversized blood vessels in the 
brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or 
seizures, at the age of five.

Cavernomas are clusters of abnormal blood vessels found mainly in the brain and spinal cord.

They vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres across.

Every year one person in every 400,000 thousand is diagnosed with a cavernoma that is causing symptoms.

They can run in families - every child of someone with inherited cavernomas has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the condition.

Nine out of ten cases are not inherited.

The average age of diagnosis is 40.

Symptoms include seizures, strokes, weakness, slurred speech, numbness, migraines and double vision.

The main form of treatment is surgery.

The tiny youngster collapsed and suffered such a huge stroke that doctors had to wait 10 days before carrying out an operation - which only had a two per cent chance of survival.

But despite beating all the odds for the operation and leading two of years of 'normal' life, her symptoms returned for a second time just before Christmas last year.

Her desperate family are now pleading with friends and relatives to help raise money to take Madi to a clinic in Chicago after her doctors said they had run out of options.

'Time is not on our side at the moment - we know how quickly this grows from when she was five,' said Mrs Hillman.

'We need to find some solution. Nobody will ever accept their child will die and if there is any way we can try and give Madi the longest future we will.'

But as she fought for her daughter's survival, she too was diagnosed with the deadly condition and has been told she faces an inevitable operation.

She said: 'It has had a massive impact 
on my life. I live with constant migraines, headaches, short term memory
 loss, falling numb on one side of my body.

'I need to be fit and healthy and fighting for Madi, so I'm so frustrated to be fighting for myself.'

Mrs Hillman said: 'I'm so frustrated I have to be fighting for myself because I need to be fit and healthy and fighting for Madi'

In a further devastating development, the family - who are originally from Clutton, Somerset, but now run a gîte in the south of France - were told the condition is genetic.

That means Madi's three siblings, Jack, 14, Georgia, seven, and Charlie, two, will also have to undergo brain scans.

They have been told they have a 50 per cent chance of contracting the condition.

'When it first happened Madi was completely paralysed,' said Mrs Hillman, who is married to property developer Tim, 33.

'We had got to a stage before where she had the operation and was starting to go back to school, but by Christmas she had really gone downhill again.

'She had the symptoms of a mini stroke, she was constantly falling over and she had headaches every day.

'The cavernoma attaches itself all around our veins, they are not cancerous so there is no radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment that can help them.

'The gene I carry means it is a very aggressive and it does grow and bleed at an impressive rate.

'The children understand and are aware of it, they expected to be tested but I don't think it has truly sunk in for them.

'Once reality sets in it will be tough, we give them the best possible life outside of the hospital, we just try and keep life as normal as we possibly can.

'The alternative is to fall apart, but that is the last thing anybody needs.'
