Olympic torch-bearer Natneal Yemane carrying the flame through Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottingham. A few hours later, he went missing from his hotel

An Ethiopian teenager who went missing hours after taking part in the Olympic torch relay has been found by police.

Natnael Yemane, 15, was last seen leaving his hotel at 9.15pm on Thursday having earlier carried the torch during the Nottinghamshire stretch of the route.

His disappearance prompted police to launch a missing person appeal, and were concerned for his welfare.

But officers found him safe and well in Nottingham last night - around 24 hours after he vanished.

He was one of 20 young people selected to take part in the torch relay through Locog's International Inspiration programme.

The youngster was chosen as a 
torchbearer as part of the programme 
which provides sport and play opportunities to more than 12 million 
children in 20 countries around the world.

The
programme was developed to help enrich the lives of young people around
the world through physical education and activities.

He took part in the Olympic torch relay on Thursday, carrying the flame on a leg through Radcliffe-on-Trent.

The teenager was cheered on by thousands of people as he carried the torch.

Hours later however, he was reported missing from the hotel he was staying at in Nottingham.

He was staying at the Jurys Inn, at Waterfront Plaza, Nottingham and is believed to have left at 9.15pm..

Police in Nottingham reported they found Olympic torchbearer Natnael Yemane last night

Nottinghamshire Police were concerned as Mr Yemane does not speak very good English and was not thought to be street-wise.

Police had been studying CCTV footage 
from in and around Nottingham, including train and bus stations. He was 
reported found by police late yesterday evening
