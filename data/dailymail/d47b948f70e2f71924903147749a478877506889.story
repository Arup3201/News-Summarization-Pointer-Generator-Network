The population of Romania has shrunk by nearly eight per cent in a decade, largely thanks to emigration.

Figures from the country’s latest census showed yesterday that numbers have fallen by 1.5million over the last ten years.

The key reason is that many younger Romanians have departed to work in countries including Spain and Italy, leaving behind an ageing population and falling birthrates.

Romania's population is falling as a result of migration and a low birth rate. Last month several Romanian squatters were found to be living in a 'shanty town' illegally in north London

The census figures were published in 
advance of the new wave of emigration expected at the end of the year. 
In January Britain will open its labour market to  citizens of Romania 
and Bulgaria.

More than 100,000 Romanians and 
Bulgarians have already come to live in this country, but under EU 
freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take British jobs
 without restrictions from January.

The figures released in Bucharest 
yesterday showed that the Romanian population was just over 20million in
 2011. This was 1.55 million fewer than in the 2001 census.

Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London

Some 68 mainly Romanian squatters were living in the huts made of plastic and waste wood amid filth

The population of Romania has fallen by 1.55million in just ten years according to the 2011 census

In 1989, when Romania emerged from the Ceausescu communist dictatorship, the population was 23million.

David Cameron has come under pressure to maintain restrictions next year in spite of EU rules.

Ministers are deeply aware of powerful indications that Britain faces a large new influx of migrants.

Romania and Bulgaria are both deeply mired in poverty compared to most EU countries.

A BBC Newsnight poll indicated in 
April that 8.2 per cent of Romanians and 13.6 per cent of Bulgarians are
 ready to consider travelling to Britain as a migration destination this
 year or next.

Britain is a much more likely 
destination country than Italy or Spain, which are both suffering very 
high unemployment as their governments enforce austerity to deal with 
the euro crisis.

Last month Police and immigration officials moved in to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by Romanian migrants in  a leafy London suburb.

A total of 68 mainly Romanian 
squatters were found living in huts built from waste wood and plastic 
amid the filth of a tip at the former Hendon FC ground.

The immigrants were said to have been living at the site for several months before the raid

The Roma travellers were given papers ordering them to leave the site which had 'danger' notices written in Romanian

Just
 five of those at the camp, which was featured in the Daily Mail earlier
 this month, were found to have the right to work in the UK.

The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer. Only 19 took up the offer.

Those who didn't take the ticket were told they would have to 
leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to 
live rough or in shelters.

It could cost up to £15,000 for 
police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them.

London mayor Boris Johnson recently said that the country should give illegal immigrants amnesty.

He said the government had to be 'honest' that when someone has been in Britain for 15 or 20 years 'authorities no longer really pursue you'.

But
 the Prime Minister has rejected the idea, warning last week that it 
would send out a ‘terrible signal of Britain as a soft touch’.

Boris Johnson defied warnings from David Cameron to back the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the UK

The coalition has sought to take a 
tougher line on immigration, unveiling a raft of measures to curb 
benefit tourism and deport people in the UK illegally.

Appearing on his new monthly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3, the London Mayor said: 'This is a chronic problem and if you 
look at what has happened in this country over the last 20 years, we 
have continuously failed to evict anybody.

‘If you look at the number of people 
who are staying here illegally and you measure that against the number 
that are meant to be on planes, it is absolutely astonishingly small.

‘The culture of human rights, the 
immense power of the ambulance-chasing lawyers who immediately come in 
and offer people protection against eviction, insert all sorts of delays
 into the procedure. It is blindingly difficult to get people on to 
planes.

‘They melt away into the maquis, into 
the undergrowth, and they are lost again. It is one of the reasons 
people lost confidence in the immigration system.’

Romania joined the EU in 2007, allowing increased migration

This combined with the falling birth rate has caused the drop
