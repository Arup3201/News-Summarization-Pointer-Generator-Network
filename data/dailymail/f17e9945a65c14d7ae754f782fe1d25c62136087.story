We may think that trolling is a modern phenomenon, but the Romans wrote vile messages wishing ill on others, centuries before social media was invented.

A collection of 130 ancient 'curse tablets' featuring gruesome messages of revenge has been added to the World Heritage register.

They include wishes that thieves should go blind and mad, while cheaters become as 'liquid as water.'

The wishing of ill-health and death on a person is typical of many Roman curses.

People inscribed pieces of lead and pewter with nasty messages asking gods and spirits to act on their behalf.

Some messages included magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Others were pierced with nails to achieve a similar result.

Many of the tablets were thrown into sacred pools in temples or interred with the dead so that gods could be easily contacted.

Curses were sometimes rolled up, hidden under floors or in wall cavities, or nailed up.

The nasty messages – known as curse tablets - were written on pieces of lead by victims of theft or wrong doing, and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset.

Now 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the
 Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation 
(Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary 
heritage.

In what could be the Roman version of modern-day trolling, the authors poured bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways.

One tablet asks for an adversary's intestines to be ‘quite eaten away’, while another one reveals that the victim of a theft of a bronze vessel wanted the cup to be filled with the thief’s blood.

One of the tablets is written in British Celtic - the only text known to survive in that language - while another tablet contains the earliest known use of the word Christian in Britain.

The curses, which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of lead and pewter and are addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva.

Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom and healing (as well as the arts, commerce, strategy and magic). She can be depicted with weapons or with an owl.

Celts worshiped Sulis, who was a sun god of fertility at the thermal spring of Bath -named Aquae Sulis in Latin.

The two goddesses were gradually rolled into one so that British Romans came to worship Sulis Minerva.

Fires were continually burned at shrines, which were natural hot springs.

The lead tablets suggest that Sulis Minerva was life-giving but also adept at punishing wrong-doers as a goddess of justice.

Over 130 curse tablets addressed to the goddess have been found in Bath - written in Latin, a local version of the Roman language and in Brythonic, an ancient Celtic language.

There is a Roman temple dedicated to Sulis Minerva - the primary deity of the temple spa - in Bath.

Aquae Sulis was a religious site before the Romans arrived and the springs at bath have been used for more than 10,000 years, with the Celts thought to have built the first shrine there in 700BC.

But the Romans modernised the site with grand temples, altars and bath buildings complete with lead pipes to ensure a constant flow of water to the giant lead-lined pool.

They were cast into the hot springs at Bath, where they were left for the goddess, who was worshiped by Celts and Romans and believed to dispense justice.

They are the only objects from Roman Britain to have been added to the UK’s part of the register.

Many of the curses have been translated from their original Latin and reveal that not only were Bath's Romans creative in their requests for revenge, but were also very specific.

One person asked that a thief who had stolen their gloves should go 'mad and blind', saying: ‘Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds and eyes in the goddess' temple.’

While 
another person wrote: ‘May he who carried off Vilbia from me become 
liquid as the water. May he who so obscenely devoured her become dumb’.

There was also a tendency for particularly gory punishments for the guilty, including a curse about a stolen ring.

The
 aggrieved victim said: ‘…so long as someone, whether slave or free, 
keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) 
blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite 
eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft).’

Councillor
 Ben Stevens, Bath and North East Somerset Council's cabinet member for 
sustainable development, accepted the certificate of inscription on 
behalf of the local authority.

He
 said: ‘The decision by Unesco to inscribe the Roman curse tablets from 
Bath on the Memory of the World register reflects the very special 
nature of this collection, and is another reason for local people to 
take pride in the exceptional quality of our local heritage here in 
Bath.’
