An actor with an uncanny resemblance to Rob Ford is to take on the role of Toronto's controversial mayor in a new musical comedy.

Sheldon Bergstrom, a portly 42-year-old Canadian who dyed his hair blond, said he begged producers to audition for the part in 'Rob Ford the Musical: Birth of A Ford Nation'.

The musical is set to debut at Toronto's Factory Theatre in September - just over a month before the infamous politician seeks re-election.

The 90-minute show has ten original tunes and sees a 'spiritual guide' leading Ford through the past year of his tumultuous life — including his admitted drug use and stint in rehab.

Producers said the actor won the role over nearly 100 other hopeful actors, including one who is starring on Broadway.

Mr Bergstrom said: 'All across Canada, all throughout the world, people are watching this man, this mayor of ... Canada's greatest city, and he has managed to pull off some amazing things and pull off some crazy things in his time as mayor.

He added that the script gives Ford a 'fair shake' and that it was not an attempt to pick on Ford, who has gone from one controversy to another since admitting last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor.'

The 90-minute show has ten original tunes and sees a 'spiritual guide' leading Rob Ford, pictured in 2013, through the past year of his tumultuous life - including his admitted drug use and stint in rehab.

Ford returned to work in June after a two-month stint in rehab, pledging an 'unwavering' commitment to living clean. 

His duties as mayor have been curtailed since last year, when Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers.

Writer Brett McCaig said that resemblance, as well as the actor's talent, got him the part. 

And he hopes the show will be extended, with ambitions of going 'off-Broadway' with the production. 

But that will depend on the outcome of the mayoral race, he said.

Representatives for Rob Ford, pictured, have reportedly expressed indifference about the musical

'The story dies if Rob doesn't get voted back in,' he added. 

'If Rob gets voted back in, I think we've got legs for a continued run, for sure.'

Rob Ford's spokesman Amin Massoudi expressed indifference about the musical, repeating a phrase that the mayor has taken to using when asked about his personal troubles: 'This is not news.'

'The mayor is concerned with running an efficient municipal government, creating jobs and building more subways in Toronto,' Massoudi said.
