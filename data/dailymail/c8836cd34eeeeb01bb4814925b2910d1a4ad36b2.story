Spreading the word: The popular hook-up app Tinder has gained a huge following among young Mormons in recent months

Tinder, the hook-up app, has gained a huge following among college students since its launch last fall. Now it's finding a more unlikely audience: Mormons.

According to The Universe, Brigham Young University's student newspaper, the free iPhone app is spreading through the college like wildfire.

Some have labeled Tinder the 'female Grindr' because it works in a similar way as the gay dating app. So why is it so popular among an ultra-religious student body where more than 20per cent of the student body is married by graduation?

Perhaps the app appeals to Mormons because it also has a clean-cut, polite image.

The app works like virtual speed dating meets 'Hot or Not': It uses Facebook profiles to
pair users up with matches within their geographical area, rating them based on shared friends, interests, and networks.

Instead
of ringing a bell at the end of a seven-minute date, a user can 
'like' or reject a picture  within seconds. They can only chat with people who have
liked them back. Otherwise, they can 'keep playing' and scroll through 
more pictures.

Because it's totally anonymous until both users opt in, the rejection factor is low.

Tinder has appealed to women in particular more than Blendr (the actual female version of Grindr
that was developed by the same company), because it offers an added 
layer of authentication via Facebook.

This helps avoid the creep factor 
of an inbox filled with random emails from shirtless men posing in front
of their bathroom mirrors, and filter out catfish.

Unlikely new audience: Tinder is commonly described as a Grindr for women, and is typically used for casual dating. Now Mormon students at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, are using it too

But many dating apps targeting members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints seem seriously heavy: One requires users to complete an in-depth questionnaire to generate a compatibility score, daters to list their thresholds and dealbreakers and 
offers a Myers-Briggs personality profile as an optional feature.

Tinder, unlike a lot of other dating websites, is actually fun to use.

It may seem strange for a casual hook-up app to become popular at a school known for its strict honor code: In 2011, starting forward
Brandon Davies was controversially suspended for the rest of his season
for having sex with his girlfriend, violating the provision 
preventing premarital sex.

But dating is a huge pastime at BYU. According to official LDS dating guildelines, young people 16 or older should 'go in groups or on double 
dates' and 'avoid going on frequent dates with the same person' so that 
they avoid getting too serious with someone until they are old enough 
for a serious relationship. 

In other words, keep it casual - but nix the sexting.
