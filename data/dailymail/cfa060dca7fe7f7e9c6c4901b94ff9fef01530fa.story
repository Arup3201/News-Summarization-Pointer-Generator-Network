Provocative: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange addresses a meeting 
at the United Nations in New York via videolink from Ecuador's 
London embassy

David Cameron faced acute embarrassment last night as Wikileaks fugitive Julian Assange mocked Britain in an address to the United Nations in which he bragged about being a ‘free man'.

The leaks campaigner addressed a UN meeting in New York over a satellite link from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.

Speaking via videolink from the embassy study, Assange said: ‘I speak to you today as a free man because despite having been detained for 659 days without charge, I am free in the most basic and important sense - I am free to speak my mind.

‘It is thanks to the United Nations that I’m able to exercise my inalienable right to seek protection from this arbitrary and excessive action taken by governments against me and the staff and supporters of my organisation’.

Mr Cameron had earlier addressed the UN General Assembly on the second day of his visit to New York calling for greater backing for ‘emerging democracies’ in the Arab world.

But fears that his speech would be overshadowed by the Wikileaks campaigner were borne out when Mr Assange accused the United States of persecuting his organisation and torturing Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables.

The Wikileaks founder’s speech came as it emerged that Ecuador’s foreign minister plans to hold talks with the UK Government tomorrow to try to resolve the deadlock over Assange’s continued presence at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.

Addressing a UN conference called ‘Strengthening Human Rights’, in his typical grandstanding style, Assange spent 14 minutes railing railing against the US government for investigating WikiLeaks - and claimed credit for sparking the Arab Spring.

He accused the US government of detaining Bradley Manning without charge and mistreating him - telling the UN that Manning was ‘degraded, abused and psychologically tortured.’.

Manning, the alleged source of Wikileaks' embassy cables, without charge and mistreating him

Assange also accused the United States
 of harassing his organisation claiming the ‘FBI produced 42,135 pages 
of WikiLeaks-related activity; less than 8,000 concern Manning’.

In his speech Assange said the US was ‘trying to erect a national regime of secrecy, a national regime of obfuscation’.

He tore into President Obama and said that he was ‘distorting’ facts ‘for his own gain’.

Assange said: ‘There is a time for action and a time for words. The time for words has run out.

‘It is time for the US to cease its 
persecution of WikiLeaks, to cease its persecution of our people and to 
cease its persecution of our alleged sources.

Assange, an Australian national, 
spoke on the day that it emerged he has been labelled an ‘enemy of the 
state’ by the US government.

The classification, which puts him in
 the same bracket as Al Qaeda, means he could face the death penalty if 
convicted of a crime in America.

Embarrassed: Prime Minister David Cameron had earlier spoken to the UN on the second day of his visit to New York calling for greater backing for 'emerging democracies' in the Arab world

Big moment ruined: Fears that Mr Cameron's speech would be 
overshadowed by the Wikileaks campaigner were borne out when Mr Assange 
accused the United States of persecuting his organisation

Today marks 100 days since Mr Assange 
sought political asylum in an effort to avoid extradition to Sweden 
where he is wanted on rape and sex abuse charges.

Mr
 Assange arrived at the embassy on June 19, after a court ruled he could
 be sent for trial.

During his appeal, which went all the way to the 
Supreme Court, he was allowed out on bail and since losing the case he 
has refused to leave the embassy

An official from the Ecuadorian 
embassy said that foreign minister Ricardo Patino planned to meet UK 
Foreign Secretary William Hague at the United Nations in New York 
tomorrow.

He said: ‘We hope 
that tomorrow’s meeting will mark the beginning of a new chapter in 
seeking a solution to the present situation.

‘For
 the part of the Ecuadorian government we are more than willing to find 
an amicable answer that respects the values of international human 
rights and the integrity of sovereign nations.’

A Foreign Office spokesman also confirmed the meeting was scheduled to take place tomorrow.

Dozens of police officers have been on
 guard outside the building in Knightsbridge, central London, ever since
 - at huge cost to taxpayers.

It is thought the saga has already cost taxpayers some £1million in court, legal and policing costs.

Mr
 Assange claims he fears extradition to the United States over the 
activities of the whistle-blowing website if he travels to Sweden.

He was granted political asylum by the government of Ecuador last month and has remained in the embassy ever since.

Ecuador’s foreign minister Ricardo 
Pantino also addressed the United Nations yesterday on the subject of 
political asylum, referring specifically to the Assange case.

Mr Assange is thought to be planning an appeal to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which could delay the process by years.

Ecuador has called for Britain to allow Mr Assange safe passage to the South American country. But the Government has made clear he must be arrested if he steps outside the building.

The Foreign Office was left humiliated when Ecuador published a letter in which British diplomats threatened to storm the embassy and arrest Mr Assange if he refused to come out.
