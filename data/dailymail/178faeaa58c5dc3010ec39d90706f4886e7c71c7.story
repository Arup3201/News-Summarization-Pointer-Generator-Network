A teacher has managed to lose five and a half stone after her size caused a classroom chair to break beneath her - in front of an entire class of pupils.

Lucy Miller, 23, sat on the chair in front of her class, only to be mortified as it collapsed under her 17st weight.

Humiliated, Lucy vowed to beat the bulge. She ditched her unhealthy lifestyle and now weighs in at just under 12st.

Lucy has dropped from 17st 3lbs and size 22 to 11st 10lbs and a size 12 (right)

It was after breaking the chair in class that Lucy decided it was time to take action about her size

Lucy said: 'When I felt the chair legs give way beneath me I was just so embarrassed.

'As I lay in a heap on the floor I heard one of the pupils say that I was too fat for the chair.

'The little boy wasn’t being rude - he was only five - but it was the shock I needed to make me realise how big I was.

'I picked myself up, trying to pretend like it was nothing, but it was just awful.

'I left school that day determined to do something about my weight.'

Lucy, from Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancs, had piled on the pounds since becoming a primary school teacher.

Lucy said: 'I’ve always been a big girl, I come from an overweight family and my mum was always on diets.

Lucy, who has always struggled with her weight, found that it began to creep up when she started her job as a school teacher, but now she has shed the pounds she finds it much easier to keep up with the children

'It was normal for me to have seconds or thirds after dinner, and at high school I’d always have sweets in my pocket.

'But when I got my first job as a teacher I put on even more weight.

'I’d have pastries and sweets for breakfast, have pies as a snack on my way home from work and then eat tea too.

'After eight months my trousers didn’t fit and I was wearing my baggiest blouses.

Lucy said that her determination to lose weight was in part because both her parents suffered health conditions which can be made worse by being overweight

'Even my size 22 dress was getting tight.

'It started to become difficult to sit down on the floor with the children, and run around after them.

'I’d dread teaching P.E because I didn’t have the energy to do it - it was a nightmare.

'I was always out of breath.'

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Fast food like KFC or Subway

Dinner: Large portion of cottage pie or chicken curry, plus cake or ice cream

Snacks: Many throughout the day

Breakfast: Cambridge Weight Plan shake

Lunch: Chicken salad

Dinner: Small portion of chicken and vegetables

Drink as much water as possible each day

But after breaking the chair in class, Lucy decided it was time to take action.

Lucy now has lots oif energy and can easily keep up with her class

She joined the Cambridge Weight Plan in May 2013 and in just six months has gone from 17st 3lbs, to a svelte 11st 10lbs.

She said: 'I’d tried various diets in the past but nothing ever worked for me.

'I’d spent so much time and money on diets, but it didn’t matter.

'I’d go to meetings to get weighed but then I’d head straight out the doors into the fish and chip shop.

'But this time it was different - I was so determined that I would lose it.

'It was hard at first but as the weight melted off I gained more energy and I loved the person I was becoming.

'Whenever I wanted to give up, I had to remember the health benefits. My dad had a heart attack and my mum has been diagnosed with high cholesterol - I didn’t want to go the same way as them.

'I think even my family and friends found it hard to believe that I would do it this time, with people telling me I’d never keep the weight off, but I was determined to prove myself.

'I wear a size 12 now, and I’m much more confident.'

Now, Lucy has the energy to run around after her lively class of children.

'Now I can jump about in P.E, and put together fun and energetic lessons.

'Getting down on the floor to read to the children is no problem, and everything is so much easier.

'I’m so proud of myself for losing the weight, and it’s taught me so much.

'I love the fact that I am now a good role model for the children I teach in my school.

'It’s the best thing I’ve ever done, I’m so happy.'
