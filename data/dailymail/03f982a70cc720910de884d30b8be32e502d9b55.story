U.S. President Barack Obama's request to have roundabouts demolished to make way for The Beast may have seemed outrageous but now the demands of Russian President Vladimir Putin may have put that request to shame.

During his whirlwind stay at Brisbane's Hilton hotel for the G20 Summit, Mr Putin had his food tested before he ate it just in case it was poisoned and was often flanked by a mob of security officers.

An unnamed employee of the hotel in the city's CBD has lifted the lid on the tight security measures and the demands of one of its most powerful guests.

The worker told news.com.au the hotel usually had to step up its game 'a heck of a lot' to meet the standards required by a high-profile guest, which included musicians and athletes.

The hotel, which is located across the river from the South Bank location of the Brisbane Convention Centre where most of the talks were held, also had guests from Mexico and Mauritania during the two-day summit.

But it was the Russian strongman's entourage that took up 75 per cent of the rooms in the hotel.

Like other countries' leaders, Mr Putin had travelled to Brisbane with his own bodyguards and had added protection with 'undercover' police officers patrolling not only the outside of the hotel but staying inside as well.

The employee said it was all hands on deck 24 hours a day during the weekend, including the kitchen which was responsible for cooking up food for Mr Putin and members of his delegation who opted to dine-in.

This was the case with most leaders unless they had official engagements to attend.

'We prepared it in our kitchen and it was taken up to him [Mr Putin] in the restaurant or wherever he was dining and it was tasted by someone first to ensure that it wasn't poisoned or anything along those lines and then it was plated up and served,' he said.

The employee also put an end to speculation as to why Mr Putin had left the summit earlier than expected, saying his Sunday afternoon departure had always been planned.

But Mr Putin's demands are not the first outrageous ones to emerge.

Leading up to the summit, which ran from Saturday to Sunday, it was revealed Barack Obama's delegation made a request to have a major roundabout in Brisbane demolished.

The roundabout is located near the University of Queensland - in the city's western suburbs - where Mr Obama gave an address to a packed room.

The reason given for the request was so his enormous presidential car, known as The Beast, did not have to slow down but it was rejected by Queensland authorities, The Australian reported.
