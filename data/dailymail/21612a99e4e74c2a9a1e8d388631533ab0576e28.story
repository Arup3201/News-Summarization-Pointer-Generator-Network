A businessman who destroyed his 40-year marriage by ‘putting to death’ his wife’s pet ram has been ordered to pay her £170,000 a year in maintenance.

The globe-trotting couple – whose property portfolio includes a £15million home in Camden, north London – enjoyed a life of luxury until the pet was slaughtered at one of their homes in the south of France.

Mr Justice Mostyn said the ram’s death last year followed an ‘animated argument’ between the husband, 68, and his 70-year-old wife and it was ‘perhaps unsurprising that the relationship irretrievably collapsed at that point’.

Put to death: The husband caused a 'very animated' row by killing her wife's pet ram, a High Court Judge said

The mother of two issued a divorce 
petition in London, insisting her ‘completely Anglicised’ husband had 
made his home in the UK, although he had for years insisted to the tax 
authorities that he had ‘non-dom’ status.

The
 husband, whose main interests are said to be shooting and fine wine, 
had spent over 110 days in England in the past 12 months – more than 
anywhere else in the world – and the wife therefore had an ‘arguable 
case’ he was domiciled here, the judge ruled.

The
 wife had claimed more than £390,000 in annual maintenance to tide her 
over, including £24,000 for ‘clothes and footwear’. However, Mr Justice 
Mostyn trimmed this down to £170,000 a year.

The
 case will return to court when a judge will decide if the English 
courts have jurisdiction to hear the wife’s divorce petition.

Details of the couple's disputes emerged after a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Mr Jusitce Mostyn said: 'After over 40 years of marriage, relations between the parties in 2011 soured and, in that year, according to the wife, the husband asked for a separation,' said Mr Justice Mostyn in a written ruling on a preliminary dispute about maintenance.

'In June 2013, relations between the parties irretrievably broke down, when the parties had a most animated argument in the south of France, in circumstances where the husband had put to death the wife’s pet ram.'

Mr Justice Mostyn said the woman applied for maintenance, pending a trial of the couple’s claims over money, at a hearing in March.

The woman’s 'budget' included £18,000 a year for restaurants, £70,000 for holidays and European flights, and £24,000 for clothes and footwear. The man said her claims, which totalled £393,000 a year, were 'too high'.

Mr Justice Mostyn said he had concluded that she should be paid around £14,166 a month - about £170,000 a year - in maintenance.

Her revised budget included £12,000 for clothes and shoes, £50,000 for flights and holidays and £10,000 for restaurants.

Mr Justice Mostyn added that there was no suggestion the man would struggle to pay the huge sums for his wife's upkeep.

His judgment also dealt with the issue of 'divorce tourism' raised by the fact that the man and woman are filing for divorce in separate countries in an apparent bid to get a better settlement.

Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'It is perfectly obvious what the motives of the parties were in issuing proceedings respectively in England and Austria.

'The wife obviously believes that she will be afforded more generous treatment by this court than in the court of her homeland.  The husband believes that he will be afforded more conservative and, therefore to him, more generous treatment in the court of his wife's homeland.'

However he added that under European law there is nothing to stop claimants 'shopping' for a better deal, and that to an extent the practice is 'encouraged' by the lack of clauses to stop it.

The case is due to continue at a further hearing in December.
