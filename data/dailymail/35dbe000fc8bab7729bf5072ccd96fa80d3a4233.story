Monica Lewinsky is writing a tell-all book about her affair with Bill Clinton after the scandal left her hard up, unable to get a job and with her dreams dashed, friends have claimed.

The former White House intern, 39, is reportedly penning the book - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he desired threesomes - for revenge on her former flame.

But friends say it could simply be a matter of cash for Lewinsky, who was left with massive legal debts and could never achieve her dream of 'losing 30 lbs, finding a boy, moving to Westchester County and having a family' after revelations of her Oval Office trysts with Clinton surfaced.

Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky is reportedly writing a $12 million tell-all book about her affair with Clinton

While Lewinsky has yet to sign a deal, it had previously been claimed that publishers were scrambling for the book and had offered her as much as $12 million.

'She may very well need the money,' a friend told MailOnline. 'That’s why she did the Andrew Morton [biography in 1998]. She had massive legal debts. It was a misconception that she came from a wealthy family. She's had trouble finding work.

'She went to the London School of Economics where it was easier for her blend in, because, in Europe, what prime minister hasn’t had an affair? But when she came back to the States, she couldn’t escape her past.

'Who is going to hire her and have her name come across in an email? It's unfair. She's a smart, capable, personable woman. How many 22-year-olds have made bad judgements?

'I think, if she had her dream, she would have lost 30 pounds, found a boy, moved to Westchester County, and had a family.'

Speaking to the National Enquirer, friends
 said the book will include never-before-seen love letters that she
 wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent 
them.

They reportedly detail her love for 
Clinton and how Lewinsky, then just 22, could make him much happier than
 his wife, Hillary, who the president called a 'cold fish'.

The book will also reportedly detail how he laughed about his nonexistent sex life with Hillary - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage.

'Monica can describe how Bill went on 
and on about his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies and the use
 of sex toys of all kinds,' the friend added to the Enquirer.

As
 well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky 
also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her
 liaison with the president, the source said.

She
 was carrying a child fathered by a Pentagon employee called 'Thomas', 
she revealed in an earlier biography written by Andrew Morton. 'That 
void has never been filled,' said the friend.

She is also writing it to get revenge on Clinton, now 66, friends said.

'For years, Monica tried to protect 
Bill out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,' a source told the Enquirer. 'But she no 
longer feels that way, and her memoir is his worst nightmare.'

During her grand jury testimony 
against Clinton in 1998, an immunity deal prevented her from exposing 
intimate details about their affair in the Morton expose that came out that 
year.

Denial: With his wife standing by in January 1998, Clinton insists he did not have relations with 'that woman'

Truth: But in August 1998, Clinton confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her

'But that agreement expired in 2001, and 
when Bill published his autobiography My Life three years later, 
Monica felt betrayed by him all over again,' said the source.

But another source told MailOnline 
that, while she was exploring the option of writing a book, she wasn't 
out for revenge. 'That's not like her,' they said.

Another longtime friend added: 
'Someone may have pitched her the idea and she said, "Why not?" Maybe 
she could do a self-help book on how to survive a scandal.'

But they added it was unlikely it 
would be a sordid tell-all: 'She wouldn’t get into salacious details 
like that. That's not her mindset.'

Editors have also cast doubt over interest in the book, questioning whether a $12 million deal is really on the cards.

One top editor told MailOnline she 
believed that, considering Clinton's current popularity, a book trashing
 him 'would be a non-starter' that would only be suited to select, 
conservative publishers.

'Nightmare': Lewinsky's friends believe the book could rock Clinton's marriage to Hillary, left, who he called a 'cold fish' during the affair. They are also pictured with daughter Chelsea

Her bids for a book deal will at least 
shake Clinton - bringing him crashing down from the success he enjoyed 
after an energetic speech at the Democratic National Convention earlier 
this month.

Her apparent attempts to cash in on the affair could rattle the 
Clinton marriage - and wreck Hillary's bid for the presidency in 2016.

It could also affect Clinton's health; he has undergone two heart surgeries in recent years.

Though it has been 14 years since she
 claimed she had nine sexual encounters with the president, her presence
 still looms in the life of Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's 
political career.

In what was an unfortunate and 
awkward schedule at the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina
 earlier this month, Lewinsky's former rabbi - who publicly condemned 
Clinton during the sex scandal - gave the benediction minutes after the 
former President took the stage.

ABC
 News reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by 
organizers because Rabbi David Wolpe is such a well-known figure in the 
Jewish community.

And 
in July, during a visit to Egypt as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary 
Clinton was taunted by her husband's affair by protesters as they 
chanted 'Monica, Monica!'
