This unfortunate mug shot belongs to Gabriel Harris, a 33-year-old blue-haired man who was arrested at a Taco Bell restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, just after 3 a.m. on Sunday.

According to his arrest report, Harris  got into an altercation at the drive-through after staff refused to take his order because he wasn’t in a car.

Harris and a woman, named as Sarah Haliburton, then entered the restaurant but were again refused because it was after 3 a.m. and the restaurant had closed.

When Harris refused to leave because he had already placed an order, employees called the cops. 

An employee told Aron Tobler told police that he refused service to Harris and Haliburton because 'they placed an order on bicycles.' 

Police found Harris on a bicycle by the menu speaker, reports The Daytona Beach News-Journal.

When police arrived they asked Harris to leave, but then spotted a red Swiss Army knife on his belt loop and tried to reach for it. 

Harris then grabbed the officer's wrist and was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.

Police say he suffered a scraped forehead as a result of the scuffle.

Sunday's incident is Harris’ second arrest in the past four months. He was arrested for resisting an officer without violence in early August, reports the Miami Herald.
