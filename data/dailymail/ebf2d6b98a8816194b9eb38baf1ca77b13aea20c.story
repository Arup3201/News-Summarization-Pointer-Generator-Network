It is one of the world's most photographed cities.

But these images offer a completely new and unique perspective on New York.

They were taken by taxi driver David Bradford as he travelled around the famous city.

Mr Bradford became a taxi driver in 1990 and immediately realised he had a unique front-row view of the city.

Speaking in a short film for New York.com, Mr Bradford said: 'The first day behind the wheel I realised 'wow, i have got a front row seat on New York City'.

'When I have a camera in hand it is like I am fully engaged with the city. It is like a dialogue.

'A city is like a moody person. It is a gut thing. I shoot from my gut.'

As well as being a photographer and taxi driver,  Mr Bradford has also been a dancer, trombone player, artist and  freelance illustrator.

For 10 years, he was an art director at Saks Fifth Avenue.

But he decided to become a taxi driver to have more time to develop independent projects.

But, after picking up his camera, he began creating his unique portrait of New York in 1993.

Since then he has created two books called Drive-by Shootings and Back Seat Book.

Drive-by Shootings sold out of its initial 50,000-book print run in just three months.
