A psychotic couple took two children hostage at knifepoint in their own home after a two-day alcohol and drugs binge.

Michaela Brown and her boyfriend William Lawday barricaded themselves in to a bedroom with a ten-year-old girl and a boy aged 14 because they thought they were under attack from 80 soldiers.

Both were let into the house by the children after banging on the doors and windows.

Brown, 24, and Lawday, 30, had fled their own home believing they were in imminent danger after 48 hours of taking the former legal high M-Cat, alcohol and the anti-anxiety drug diazepam.

They both appeared at Hull Crown Court
 for sentence after pleading guilty to two charges of false imprisonment of each of the two children.

The
 court heard Lawday ordered the children upstairs while wielding a 
12-inch knife and barricaded the bedroom door with a chest of draws, toy
 box and TV set.

The terrified girl was told to hide in a cupboard and at one point Lawday attempted to climb in as well.

An
 hour before the incident, Lawday and mother-of-two Brown had called the
 police to their own home claiming men were banging around in their loft.

A police officer searched the loft and found no one.

He formed the belief the couple were suffering from a drug-induced psychosis and left.

Prosecutor
 James Byatt told the court the couple had arrived at a house on an 
estate in Hull not realising the children were left home alone.

The mother of the 10-year-old girl had
 taken her two-year-old child to hospital, leaving her with a 
22-year-old babysitter and a 14-year-old friend.

The 22-year-old had then left the pair home alone at around 4pm on February 25.

Mr Byatt told the court: 'The Crown 
says they were well under the influence of drugs and alcohol they held 
these two children captive for an hour. Lawday had a knife.

'The children had heard banging on the windows with Lawday shouting: "Let me in! Let me in!"

'The boy said Lawday's pupils were dilated. He said the pair were both talking about guns and knives.

'Lawday had a knife up his sleeve and the boy described him as off his face.

'Both adults told the children to go upstairs and get in the spare room.

'Sinner': Lawday shows off his tattoo. The court heard he ordered the terrified girl to hide in a cupboard and at one point attempted to climb in as well

'The boy said he did this because Lawday had a knife. The girl was crying, she said she was terrified. There were no verbal threats to the children.'

He said Brown tried to use her mobile phone to call the police, but the battery had died.

He added: 'She asked one of the children if they had a phone.

'The boy said there was one downstairs. He was told to get it.

'When he got back Lawday said there were 25 people in the loft. Then he said there were eight. He did not make much sense.'

The 999 call was made and Lawday told a police operator four males where outside with Samurai swords trying to get in.

He told the police he was in a room with children.

Armed police took less than 10 minutes to arrive at the hostage scene.

The boy went to the window and signalled to the police with a set of house keys from an upstairs window.

The girl told the police: 'I was crying and very frightened.'

The boy said: 'It was scary to see a large man with a knife, who was off his head on drugs.'

Both Brown and Lawday denied they were on drugs when interviewed by the police.

Brown told a probation worker she had been on diazepam for two days.

Lawday said he had drunk alcohol and taken M-Cat.

The court was told that Lawday has 45 previous convictions, including burglary, assaulting police and possession of a knife.

Brown has one conviction and a police caution.

John Thackray, mitigating for Lawday, said: 'This is quite an extraordinary case.

'It demonstrates the consequences of people taking M-Cat.

'Lawday says he was shocked by his conduct on this occasion. He intended no real harm and at no time were the children in danger.'

Brown has two children aged five and six who lived with her former partner, the court heard.

Behind bars: Lawday (pictured) was jailed for a year, while Brown was handed a 10-month suspended prison term after each pleaded guilty to two counts of false imprisonment

Claire Holmes, for Brown, said: 'She is extremely remorseful. She is a mother and knows how the children must have felt.'

Ms Holmes said a custody hearing was due to take place next week which, depending on the result of this case, could mean she would not see her children again until they are sixteen.

She urged the judge not to jail her as she had recently suffered a miscarriage.

Sentencing the pair, Recorder Graham Robinson said their drug taking had caused serious trauma to children.

He said it had not been the fault of the young girlâ€™s mother who had perfectly properly left her and the 14-year-old boy with a babysitter who had then betrayed her trust by leaving them home alone.

'It is perfectly plain what happened. Two young children got caught up in the middle of your drug-induced psychosis.

'The result of which led to them being imprisoned in their own home as you barricaded the door with them inside.

'The boy said he saw you, Lawday, passing the 12inch kitchen knife from one hand to the other.

'Both of them seem to have been utterly terrified. I accept that the balance of your both your minds was disturbed as a result of the various substances you had taken before you attended at their home.

He jailed Lawday for 12 months because of his previous record and for possessing a knife.

He gave Brown a 10-month suspended prison sentence with a requirement to attend a women's programme to help with her drug problem.

She smiled as she walked free from court.
