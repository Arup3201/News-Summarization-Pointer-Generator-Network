Roberto Martinez has said the chance for Everton to build a new 50,000-seater stadium at Walton Hall Park is 'an incredible opportunity which the club should seriously examine.

The Everton boss praised the club's current home Goodison Park, but admitted that they needed t look at bringing in more revenue from their stadium if they wanted to progress.

The club are expected to announce a breakthrough this week about the new site, which Chairman Bill Kenwright claims 'ticks all the boxes'.

Everton's current stadium Goodison Park has a maximum capacity of 39,600 and they want to up it to 50,000

Roberto Martinez says the club want to keep the positives of Goodison Park while making progress

'It is an incredible opportunity not just for us as a football club but as an area, it is a project that can bring a lot of jobs. It is an exciting project,' said Martinez on talkSPORT.

'If we want to progress, if we want the city to have the two teams competing at the highest level we can, it is something we need to explore and we need to make sure we work extremely hard to see what the possibilities are in front of us.

Everton believe Goodison Park, their home since 1892, can no longer generate sufficient revenue

'The noise and voice of Goodison is special and is something that we treasure and value and that is something that will always be in our DNA. We will always carry that with us.

'At the moment we are enjoying Goodison Park, it is a special football ground, but in the modern game you need to take other sources of revenue into consideration if you want to carry on growing and carry on competing with the highest level of competition.'
