David Beckham and Sachin Tendulkar were among the star sporting names due at rain-soaked Wimbledon on Saturday.

Former England football captain Beckham and India's now-retired cricket talisman Tendulkar were due in Centre Court's Royal Box, as the tournament invited well-known competitors from across the sporting spectrum, in keeping with tradition for the first weekend of the championships.

Beckham was due to be accompanied by his mother, Sandra, with Tendulkar alongside wife Anjali.

Among the other names expected were World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton, England rugby captain Chris Robshaw, England cricketers past and present in Phil Tufnell, Andrew Strauss, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn.

Olympic medallists Tom Daley, Victoria Pendleton, Nicola Adams, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Amy Williams and Lizzie Yarnold are all due, as well as golfer Ian Poulter, boxing stars David Haye and Anthony Joshua, and British squash ace Laura Massaro.

There were also appearances from other celebrities including Countdown's Rachel Riley and former Miss Universe Amy Willerton.

A 10.15am downpour at the All England Club meant groundstaff had to cover the outside courts, with the roof closed on Centre Court, where play was guaranteed.

By 10.45am the rain had relented.

Forecasters MeteoGroup said heavy showers were anticipated, 'with the risk of thunder, leading to interruptions in play'.
