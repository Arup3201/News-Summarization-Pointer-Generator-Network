An eight-grade student's father was angry after his son received an assignment with a cartoon depicting political views on immigration policy.

Scott Radies of Wisconsin said his 13-year-old son, Jarrett, received the homework for social studies class at Shattuck Middle School with an illustration of two bricklayers - one each to represent a Republican and a Democrat, while the bricks symbolized a 'pathway to citizenship'.

The political cartoon, which originally appeared in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, depicts the Democrat laying down the bricks while the Republican is removing them.

Radies became upset when the questions included in the homework (above) were leading his son to not be 'fair and objective', and lean towards a particular political view

Radies became upset because he thought the questions included in the homework were marked in a way that led his son to be less 'fair and objective', and lean towards a particular political view, according to the Independent Journal Review.

Teacher Grace Davis, who did not create the cartoon, included in the worksheet questions about identifying the men in the picture, what they were building, what the symbols on their shirt represented, what action they were doing and what it meant about immigration and citizenship.

In some of Jarrett's responses, which were all marked as correct, he wrote the builders' job is 'to build and destroy the pathway to citizenship' and that 'Democrats want immigrants to come in and Republicans don't'. 

Radies said that when he discussed assignment with social studies teacher Grace Davis, she said she just wanted to expose the students to other views (left, Radies's 13-year-old son Jarrett). A spokesperson for the school district said the cartoon was skill-building for reading and understanding a political cartoon (right, Shattuck Middle School)

The angry father posted the homework assignment on Facebook with the caption: 'Knowing my political views, my son thought I would be interested in seeing what his social studies teacher has been "teaching" his 8th grade class. He was right. I am! Wth (sic) is this?'

'This assignment is absolutely unacceptable. Rather than brainwashing our kids into being future Dem voters, shouldn't they be exposing them to both sides of an issue and teach critical thinking skills? BTW (sic), notice the grade of 5/5 for giving the politically 'correct' answers. Ridiculous.' 

Radies said Davis was trying to expose other views to the students. He replied saying 'some of the other things' his son has heard during her class are consistent with not giving the 'other view' (above a comment on his Facebook about a classroom discussion with the teacher and eighth grade students)

It was confirmed that the worksheet was used in Davis's class, but Jim Strick, the Communications Director for the Neenah Joint School District, said that it was not meant to shape the eighth graders' political views (above Radies and his partner)

It was confirmed that the worksheet was used in Davis's class, but Jim Strick, the Communications Director for the Neenah Joint School District, said that it was not meant to shape the eighth graders' political views.

1. Who are the men in the picture (What is their job? Look at what they are doing for a hint)

2. What are they building?

3. What do the symbols on their shirts represent?

4. What action is being done by each man?

5. What might this mean to us about immigration and citizenship?

'The fact that the way that she structured the questions and then rewarded them with five out of five, I thought 'Wow, it definitely looks like she wanted a certain answer', and the whole thing was ridiculous, I thought,' said Radies. 

Radies said that when he discussed the assignment with Davis, she said she just wanted to expose the students to other views.

But he replied telling her 'some of the other things' his son has heard during her class are consistent with not giving the 'other view'. She responded saying the semester was not over yet.

Strick said the cartoon was skill-building for reading and understanding a political cartoon, and that it was the simplest one Davis could find at an eighth-grade level to comprehend the concept of political cartoons.
