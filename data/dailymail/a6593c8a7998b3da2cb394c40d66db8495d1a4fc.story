Allies of Vince Cable reacted furiously last night over a Liberal Democrat ‘whispering campaign’ suggesting that he is on the brink  of walking out of the Coalition.

The Mail on Sunday has been told by two well-placed sources within the party that the 71-year-old Business Secretary is considering leaving the Cabinet immediately after the party’s autumn conference.

One source close to leader Nick Clegg insisted: ‘He wants to step aside from the grind of office and take up an Election campaigning role in which he would woo back disaffected Lib Dems.

'Mischief': Vince Cable denies he is stepping down in October despite claims from within Clegg's party 

‘He would be replaced either by [Chief Secretary to the Treasury] Danny Alexander or [Scottish Secretary] Alistair Carmichael with [Employment Minister] Jo Swinson taking the remaining open Cabinet slot.’

The other source said: ‘He has just had enough. The fight has gone out of him.’

However, last night Mr Cable denounced the claims as ‘nonsense’ and insisted he would stick with  the Coalition right up to next year’s General Election.

His spokeswoman said: ‘Vince  has already been reselected to  fight his Twickenham seat in May 2015 and he fully intends to serve out his term in Government as Business Secretary.’

However, Mr Clegg’s inner circle believe Mr Cable will step aside when the Deputy PM reshuffles his team in October – and might even drop plans to contest his seat.

Doing a Hague? Many claim Cable will follow William Hague's example and step down in the next reshuffle

It has been billed as ‘doing a Hague’, after William Hague’s surprise move in the Tory reshuffle last month from Foreign Secretary to the lower-profile role of Commons Leader.

Last night a former Lib Dem MP added to the reports by claiming even ‘friends’ of Mr Cable were suggesting he would stand down before the Election. The ex MP said: ‘The rumour that Vince may go is definitely circulating.’

An announcement is expected at October’s Glasgow conference that Mr Alexander will be the party’s economic spokesman next year – a move likely to anger Mr Cable, who performed the role during the last Election.

The Business Secretary, still seen by some as a potential replacement for Mr Clegg, has had a famously fractious relationship with his leader.

Just four months ago, Clegg loyalists were furious when long- time Cable ally Lord Oakeshott commissioned an opinion poll suggesting the party would pick  up votes in marginal seats if Mr Cable replaced Mr Clegg.

And at last year’s party conference, Mr Cable infuriated the high command by suggesting it was ‘certainly possible’ the Coalition could break up before 2015 and by defying the leader’s calls to back the Government’s economic policy.

But Mr Cable’s allies angrily blamed the reports on a ‘whispering campaign’ designed to undermine the Business Secretary. One said: ‘There has been no mention  of Vince packing it in. Whoever’s putting this around is simply out to make mischief.’

Another said: ‘He’s already been reselected to fight Twickenham and there’s no suggestion at all  that he won’t.’ Mr Clegg’s office also denied any suggestion that Mr Cable would quit.

The row comes with the Lib Dems polling under ten per cent in one recent survey and facing a huge battle to hold on to many of their  57 seats next year.
