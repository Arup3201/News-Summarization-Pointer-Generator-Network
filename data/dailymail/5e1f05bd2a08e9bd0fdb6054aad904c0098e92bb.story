The man who died after falling 65-feet from an upper deck at Turner Field during a baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies on Monday has been named as life-long braves fan Ronald Lee Homer Jr.

The 30-year-old landscape gardener spoke to his mother before his fatal fall to tell her that the game had been postponed for two hours because of rain and ended the phone call telling his mother, Connie Homer, that he loved her.

According to WBSTV, Homer fell from the 400-level upper deck and landed in the players parking area outside the stadium.

Fatal Fall: Ronald Lee Homer Jr. plummeted 65-feet to his death from the upper level of stands during an Atlanta Braves game on Monday night in Georgia 

'He said ‘I love you mom, and I said ‘I love you too’ and that was 
it,' his mother said in an interview with The Associated Press on 
Tuesday morning.

'He was big hearted, just a great guy, very 
respectful,' she said. 'It didn’t matter if they were winning, losing or
what — he’s been a Braves fan forever.'

Homer, who grew up in Conyers, Georgia, graduated in 2001 from Rockdale High School, where he was involved in student government.

He
was 6 feet, 6-inches tall and did landscape work for a living, his 
mother said. He was her only son and leaves behind one sister.

There’s no indication of foul play, and the fall appears to have been an accident, Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said.

Connie
Homer said she’s heard nothing from authorities as to what might have 
caused her son to fall. An autopsy was planned for Tuesday, the Fulton 
County Medical Examiner’s Office said.

An Atlanta Braves spokeswoman declined comment Monday night, referring calls to the Atlanta police.

Fatal fall: Turner Field in Georgia, where a man has died after falling from the stands

The game had just begun after heavy rains had caused an almost two-hour delay of the game which was scheduled to start at 7:10pm when the man fell.

At 11pm, police were still on the scene at the stadium trying to piece together how Homer fell.

Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said witnesses described the fall as accidental, and added that he was not sure whether wet conditions or alcohol contributed to the fall.

'At this time there's no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental,' Chafee said late Monday.

'It appears he fell from an upper-level platform to a secured lot below.'

Monday's accident wasn't the first of 
its kind to happen at Turner Field, and marked at least the third time a
sports fan has fallen from the stands in Atlanta in about a year.

In May 2008, a 25-year-old Cumming, Georgia, man suffered head injuries when 
he fell down a stairwell at Turner Field during a game against the New 
York Mets and later died.

Police found that alcohol had factored into 
that accident, which the Braves said was the first non-medical fatality 
to happen at the ballpark.

Isaac Grubb, 20, of Lenoir City, Tennessee, died after falling over a railing at the Georgia Dome during a football game between Tennessee and North Carolina State on August 31, 2012. Authorities said he landed on another man seated in the lower level, and that alcohol was a factor.

A man fell about 25 feet over a staircase railing at a Georgia Tech-Miami football game on September 22, 2012 and was not seriously injured.

Turner Field became the home of the Braves in 1997, a year after serving as the site of major events for the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Police cannot yet comment on whether alcohol was a factor in this latest fall.
