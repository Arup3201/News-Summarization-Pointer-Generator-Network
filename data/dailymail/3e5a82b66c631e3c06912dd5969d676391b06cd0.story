Wannabe diplomat: Newly-released emails give more detail on how Tampa socialite Jill Kelley (pictured) wormed her way into military society 

Newly-released emails shed light on the ambitious Tampa socialite who inadvertently exposed General Petraeus' affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, which ended his storied career in one of the biggest military scandals of the past decade.

More than two hundred pages of emails between Jill Kelley and two senior military officials were recently obtained by the Washington Post, two years after the newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see them.  

The emails between Kelley, a married mother of three and medical researcher, show how she flattered former Marine General James N Mattis, then commander to all military forces in the Middle East, and his deputy, Vice Admiral Robert Harward, to win honorary titles that she treated as if they were a real-life diplomatic job. 

The emails show no inappropriate behavior between Kelley and the officials, though both Mattis and Harward retired from the military within a year of the scandal.

The emails, strewn with exclamation marks and capitalized letters for flair, Kelley praises Mattis and Harward for their diplomatic prowess. 

In one email sent to Mattis after a party in 2012, Kelly wrote: 'Everyone thinks you're a RockStar! We agreed how amazing it must be that you're single-handedly re-writing history.'

In a later response, Marris returned the compliment by telling Kelley: 'I wish that we could clone a couple thousand of you, but the land is likely not ready for that big an impact.'

The 39-year-old is currently in the middle of a lawsuit against the FBI and Department of Defense, agencies she claims violated her privacy by revealing her identity in the midst of the embarrassing 2012 scandal involving Petraeusm, then CIA director. 

That year, Kelley started receiving emails from an unknown account, accusing her of having an affair with Petraeus. When the emails turned threatening towards herself and her family, she filed a complaint with the FBI. 

The FBI discovered that the emails had originated from Paula Broadwell, General Petraeus' biographer, and it was revealed that the two were having an extramarital affair and that Broadwell feared Kelley was some sort of romantic rival.

That revelation caused Gen Petraeus to quit his position in disgrace, and for Marine General John Allen to retire early. 

Allen became caught up in the scandal since he was found to have exchanged an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 emails with Kelley, though some say the figure was exaggerated and closer to 300 messages.

He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and is currently working as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). 

Kelley has consistently denied having a relationship with Petraeus, or anyone else, and no evidence has ever been revealed implicating herself of any inappropriate relationship with the former four-star general.

The emails just published in the Washington Post also hold no evidence of inappropriate behavior between Kelley and her military chums.

They emails were ultimately traced back to Broadwell who apparently saw Kelley as a romantic rival, though both Petraeus and Kelley have fiercely denied any inappropriate relationship

They do however, paint a picture of how she set out to make a name for herself among the upper echelons of the military community in Florida, and how she grew over confident when she was awarded honorary diplomatic titles just for hosting parties.

'The latest set of e-mails made public by the government simply confirms that Jill Kelley is and was a talented, civic-minded woman doing productive work as Honorary Ambassador to Central Command in Tampa and as Honorary Consul for the Republic of Korea,' her attorney Allen C Raul said in a statement to the Post. 'Nonetheless, continued unauthorized government release of Kelley's emails exposes them to further unjustified embarrassment and injury.' 

Kelley and her husband Scott started to familiarize themselves with the military community in Tampa by hosting parties for officials at their mansion near MacDill Air Force Base, home to U.S. Central Command.  

After befriending Mattis and his deputy Vice Admiral Robert Harward, Kelley practically begged to be named the honorary ambassador to Central Command.

In one email to Harward on January 12, 2012, Kelley wrote: 'Sooooooooo…..Did you and Jim finally decide to make me your "official" CentCom ambassador????? Please! Please! Please! I always wanted to be an Ambassador, since I was made to be a ‘catalyst’ — that helps build or facilitate Foreign relations.' 

Military chums: The Washington Post received more than 200 pages of emails between Kelley and former Marine Gen James Mattis (left) and his deputy Vice Adm Robert Harward (right), two years after the newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see them 

'We'll have to put you through the vetting process and interviews to ensure you have the right attributes!' Harward replied. 

Kelley's efforts were not in vain as she was named the United States Central Command and Coalition Honorary Ambassador in a ceremony just three months later. 

Gen Mattis was in Baghdad at the time, so couldn't attend the April 19 ceremony. But Kelley made sure to write him in detail about the event and how seriously she took the  responsibilities of the title.

'I gave my commitment . . . as the Ambassador, to make it my priority to advance global trust, international exchange, and camaraderie within the Command.

'But most importantly I thanked Gen Mattis for his priceless support and glorius leadership. I said, without him, this would not be a reality!

'Harward also spoke — really flattering words about ‘Madame Ambassador’ He explained how they decided to designate this new position — and why the CentCom unilaterally chose me. :) (which was very humbling to hear in front of a million guys)' 

During the course of her brief time in the good graces of military society, Kelley was also named Honorary Consul to South Korea. 

The appointment came out of the blue, since she knew little about the country, but that didn't prevent her from taking the position in stride.

In an email to Gen Mattis, informing him of the position, she wrote: 'YES!!!! Honorary Consul General. I’m soooooo excited about the humbling honor. It’s ironic that I get the request from the state of Korea — which is NOT my expertise. However as a lover of International Politics/Foreign Affairs, I do find the Korean Statehood quite interesting . . . (I’m a lover of conflict problem solving, and have a keen sense of seeking opportunities in chaos.)'

It has also been revealed that Kelley was invited to visit Kabul by the Afghanistan parliament, though it's unclear why they chose to honor her. 

In an email to an unidentified State Department official on August 27, Kelley said she was 'honored' by the invitation and 'would be humbled to serve the request to foster, promote and proliferate future relations and agreements with the Members of Parliament.' She added that  Commander John Allen supported the trip, and copied him on the email. Kelley's lawyer would not say if she actually followed through with the visit.

The longer she maintained these relationships, the more confident Kelley became with her honorary titles. The emails show a darker side to the socialite, in one instance sending a dramatic message to Harward after learning that she wouldn't be the only honored guest  to attend a Bastille Day ceremony.

Though thick and thin: Kelley remains married to her husband Scott, and the couple live in Tampa with their three children while pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. government for violating their privacy

'Bob, WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT??? You never informed me of ‘3’ other Honorary Ambassadors??????'

When Adm Harward replied that he would look into the matter, Kelley responded: 'Please call . . . and make it very clear that you are NOT supporting this. These NATO guys manipulate passive behavior . . . Clearly, I’m offended, and not standing up for this . . . Please address this today, and kill this for once and for all.' 

When Petraeus' affair was revealed in November 2012, Kelley lost her favor in the military community and the honorary titles she worked to hard to win.

But she has gained some success in her privacy lawsuit. The federal government's request to throw out the case was recently overruled by a judge and the case has been cleared to continue in U.S. District Court in Washington, DC.   

Meanwhile the Justice Department is still deciding whether to bring up charges against Petraeus for allegedly leaking classified material to his mistress and biographer Broadwell. He has continually denied passing secret information.
