Prince Harry isn't the only royal blowing out candles on a birthday cake today. It's also Queen Letizia's big day as the Spanish monarch turns 42. 

But the royal didn't let her birthday get in the way of her duties as she attended the Carandell Awards at the Senate Palace in Madrid to present awards and make a speech.

For the occasion, she wore a figure-hugging floral dress with nude heels, showing once again that the mother-of-two can give the Duchess of Cambridge a run for her money as Europe's most stylish royal. 

So as she celebrates another year, FEMAIL round up her other glamorous looks...
