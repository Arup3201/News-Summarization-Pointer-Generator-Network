An era of unprecedented sporting domination came to an end at the London Olympics today, with a stunning victory for Michael Phelps in his last competitive race.

Swimming the butterfly leg of the 4X100 medley relay, Phelps, 27, displayed his characteristic power to close down the leading Japanese team and claim a record 18th gold medal and pull clear as the most successful Olympian of all time.

Cheered on by an appreciative crowd at the London Olympic Park Acquatic Centre, the U.S team romped home and Phelps punched the sky with delight as he pulled down the curtain on his stunning career competing in the pool.

Goodbye and goodluck: Michael Phelps leaves the Olympic pool for the last time

The Baltimore Bullet was joined in victory by Matthew Grevers, Brendan Hansen and Nathan Adrian.

Aided by Phelps, the U.S. team comfortably won edging out Japan and Australia in an event the United States has never lost in the history of the modern Olympic games, excluding the boycotted 1980 Moscow games.

In the final swimming event of the eight-day meet, the Americans clocked 3 minutes, 29.35 seconds.

Matt Grevers led off in the backstroke leg, Brendan Hansen swam the breaststroke, Phelps did his usual butterfly leg and Nathan Adrian was the anchor in freestyle.

The Americans trailed when Phelps dove in, but he pushed them in front.

Japan touched in 3:31.26 to take the silver medal and Australia finished in 3:31.58 to take bronze.

Bouncing back from a disappointing first race in London, a fourth-place finish in the 400 individual medley, Phelps wound up with more medals than any other swimmer at the games: four golds and two silvers.

Grevers had the Americans in front on the opening backstroke leg of the relay, but Kosuke Kitajima put Japan slightly ahead going against Hansen in the breaststroke.

Not to worry, not with Phelps going next.

He surged through the water, handing off a lead of about a quarter of a second to Adrian for the freesytle anchor. The Americans won going away in 3 minutes, 29.35 seconds, just off their own Olympic record from Beijing.

Japan held on for silver in 3:31.26, with Australia taking the bronze in 3:31.68.

The victory concludes the games for 
Phelps after a mixed start where he was denied gold in the 400m 
individual medley and 200m butterfly finals.

He
 managed to recover his form to defeat compatriot Ryan Lochte in the 
200m individual medley final and then took gold in the 100m butterfly 
yesterday.

The swimmer is the greatest Olympian 
in history and will finish the London 2012 games with four gold medals 
and two silver medals.

It was almost unthinkable for the 
Phelps era to end with anything less than a performance that puts him 
atop the podium one last time, with yet another gold medal around his 
neck, his 22nd in all.

Phelps was honored with a special individual ceremony after 
concluding his record-breaking career Saturday as the most decorated 
Olympian.

FINA president Julio Maglione presented Phelps with a silver trophy to recognize his achievements.

Phelps pushed the United States in front to win the medley relay 
Saturday in the final swimming event of the London Games, after which he
 is retiring.

He leaves the sport with a record 18 golds and 22 medals overall.

At
 the 2008 Beijing Games, Phelps won eight golds, one more than the 
previous record of seven at one games held by fellow swimmer Mark Spitz.

He picked up his 17th gold on Friday 
in his final individual race, the 100-meter butterfly, making the turn 
in seventh but rallying for a victory that was actually much more 
comfortable than his margin in the last two Olympics — a combined 
five-hundredths of a second

Phelps
 slammed the wall in 51.21 seconds for payback against the guy who edged
 him in the 200 fly, Chad le Clos of South Africa. No gliding into this 
finish, the move that cost Phelps the gold in their first meeting.

'Once I'm done,' he added, 'I think there's going to be a lot more emotion that really comes out.'

Don't
 fret about American swimming after he's gone. Led by a pair of high 
schoolers, the post-Phelps era will be in very good hands.

In
 what amounted to a symbolic changing of the guard, Phelps' victory in 
the 100 fly was sandwiched between 17-year-old Missy Franklin breaking a
 world record in the backstroke and 15-year-old Katie Ledecky taking 
down a hallowed American mark that was set nearly eight years before she
 was born.

'This has 
sort of turned into the youth Olympics,' Franklin said. 'There's so many
 members of the team that are coming up this year that are going to 
carry on this incredible generation.'

No one is more incredible than Phelps.

It
 always takes him a while to get up to speed, but he brought it home 
like a champion. That, in a sense, sums up his Olympics farewell.

'He
 has made a world of difference for swimming,' said Franklin, who 
captured her third gold of the London Games. 'It's helped people rethink
 the impossible.'

'I cannot be compared to Michael Phelps,' said Cavic, who also plans to retire after the London Games. 'I'm a one-trick pony.'

And to cap a stellar week in the pool for the United States there was victory in the women's 4x100 metres medley relay in a world record time at the London Olympics on Saturday.

The
 U.S. quartet of Missy Franklin, Rebecca Soni, Dana Vollmer and Allison 
Schmitt clocked three minutes 52.05 seconds to break the 3:52.19 set by 
China at the 2009 world championships in Rome to win gold ahead of 
Australia who won the silver, while Japan clinched bronze.
