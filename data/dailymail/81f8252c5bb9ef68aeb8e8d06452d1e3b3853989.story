Christian Benteke is out of Aston Villa's FA Cup clash with local rivals West Bromwich Albion after sustaining a minor hip injury in training.

The Belgian striker scored a nerveless stoppage-time penalty to inflict defeat on West Brom in the Premier League on Tuesday and Tim Sherwood hoped he would carry the momentum into the repeat tie at Villa Park.

But he picked up a knock before Saturday and is missing from the Villa squad entirely, with Scott Sinclair coming in as a replacement.

Writing in the match day programme, Sherwood said: 'It's unusual to play the same team twice in the space of a few says, never mind your local rivals, but having won the first one we remain just as determined to win this one.

'We know it will be a difficult game but with a sell-out crowd behind us we are hoping to win the game and make sure we are in the hat for the next round.'  

Benteke scores a goal past Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul at St James' Park, but it is disallowed
