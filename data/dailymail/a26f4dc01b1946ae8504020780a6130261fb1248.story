With long auburn hair flowing over the shoulders of a sharp suit, she looks like a businesswoman  popping into the bank to collect cash.

But in fact, she is a he – and a conman who has been targeting elderly victims into handing over their bank cards and PINs.

The cross-dressing fraudster,  captured on CCTV images, is part of a gang that is stealing thousands of pounds from old people.

North Yorkshire Police has issued CCTV of conmen who have been dressing up as women to trick elderly people into handing over their bank cards and PINs

One suspect is shown in a bank and is believed to be part of a team who don women's clothing to evade capture

Police in North Yorkshire are hunting the tricksters. Officers describe them as ‘very charming’ as they convince victims to part with their bank details and then go on to fleece their accounts.

Under the scam, the fraudsters  call their victims on the phone, pretending to be from their bank or a utility company.

They tell the elderly person there has been fraud committed against their bank account or that they have not paid a bill. The conmen then offer to send someone to the victim’s house to pick up their bank card in order to sort out the fraud or to settle the bill.

At some point, as part of their ‘plausible’ act, the conmen  also manage to obtain the victim’s PIN from them.

The gang, which struck on a number of occasions in Harrogate and York late last month and earlier this month, have succeeded in stealing thousands of pounds  after going to banks to withdraw money using their victims’ bank cards and PINs.

At the time, senior North Yorkshire officers issued a warning  for residents to be on their guard for anyone they do not know  getting in touch or calling at  the door.

The group allegedly charmed their way into pensioners' homes in York and Harrogate by posing as officials from a bank or utility company

Suspects, including a man seen in a travel agent, right, spent the money on goods and withdrew cash

They are now releasing CCTV footage of
some of the suspects which was captured as they used the stolen cards 
to withdraw cash or try to buy goods. Police are  also appealing to the 
public for information to help them track down the gang.

Detective Sergeant Lydia Davenport, of
Harrogate CID,  said: ‘These people are very plausible and charming 
when they contact the elderly people and it is easy to see how they can 
be convinced by what they are saying.  In reality they are preying on  
elderly people’s vulnerability and trusting nature.

‘There are a number of suspects 
involved who go to some lengths to disguise their identity, including 
dressing up as the opposite sex.

‘We are determined to catch them and bring them to justice.’

One suspect is seen here in a bank. Police are trying to find out if the conmen wore their disguises at the victims' homes or just when withdrawing money

North Yorkshire Police hope people will recognise the suspects from CCTV pictures

Detectives are investigating whether 
the conmen were dressed as women when they visited their victims, or 
whether it was purely a ruse to evade detection when they withdrew the 
money.

The CCTV footage shows one suspect in a
bank and a jewellery store, one in a travel agency and another 
attempting to withdraw money from a cash machine.

Five offences have been reported in Harrogate and two in York.

DS Davenport added: ‘Anyone who recognises the suspects from the images or knows who they may be should contact the police.

‘Secondly, anyone who sees any suspicious activity or vehicles in their neighbourhood, please alert the police.’

Officers from local Safer 
Neighbourhood Teams will be delivering leaflets to elderly residents to 
raise awareness of the scam and to warn them not to give their bank 
details to anyone.
