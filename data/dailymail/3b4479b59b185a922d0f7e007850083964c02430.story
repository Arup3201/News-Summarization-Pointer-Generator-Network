Most women are only too happy to shed a few pounds.

But after decades of Olympic training, it seems Victoria Pendleton cannot bear to part with even an ounce – especially off her thighs.

The cyclist, 32, who won a gold and silver medal at London 2012, revealed she has lost 10lb since signing up to Strictly Come Dancing.

However, instead of feeling more feminine with her slimmer physique, 
Miss Pendleton said she is ‘sad’ her powerful thighs are vanishing 
before her eyes.

Miss Pendleton weighed nine-and-a-half stone before training for the BBC1 show, which begins tomorrow.

The gold-medal winner also finally admitted she is determined to win the
BBC1 show, after weeks of denying she is treating it as a serious 
competition.

Speaking after the Classical Brit Awards on Tuesday, the 32-year-old
said her body shape has changed dramatically since the London Games 
this summer.

She said: ‘I’ve lost weight. Since the Olympics, I haven’t done any 
serious weight training. I’ve done a bit of work in the gym, but not any
weight training to the level that I’m used to.

‘And as a consequence I’ve already lost four and a half kilos of muscle. Mainly from my thighs.

Working hard: Despite attending lots of rehearsal sessions they are not as demanding as her cycling training

‘When I sit down and look at my legs they don’t look like mine any more.
I feel a bit sad because I’ve worked for so many years to get that.

‘And putting on a millimetre on my thigh girth, I used to be like: “Yes!, yes! Thank you. It’s working”. It is hard.’

At the peak of her cycling powers, Miss Pendleton weighed 62 kilograms (9.8stone).

She signed up to Strictly a month before winning a cycling gold in the 
women’s keirin and silver in the sprint, but was sworn to secrecy at the
time.

But asked if she feels more feminine now she has toned down the athletic
physique that powered her to victory in the velodrome, she said: ‘No. 
That’s not me.

‘I have spent my whole life trying to get bigger, musclier thighs, and 
now they are just disappearing in front of my very eyes, daily. It is 
going to take some time to get used to it.’

Miss Pendleton added her athletic frame was badly suited to the demands of ballroom dancing.

She said: ‘I have a lifetime of bad habits in dance terms. For example, 
zero flexibility in the feet. Because as a cyclist, having stiff ankles 
is an advantage.

‘And obviously on the dance floor it couldn’t be any worse, because you 
are standing on your very tip-toes the whole time. I am getting a lot of
cramp in my feet.’

'Competitive instinct': The Olympic gold medalist (pictured far right, front row, alongside her fellow contestants) has admitted that taking part in Strictly Come Dancing has brought out her competitive side

The star – who is engaged to her former cycling coach Scott Gardner - 
insisted she felt under no pressure to perform on Saturday’s live show 
with her professional partner Brendan Cole.

She said: ‘Dancing is not my thing. I’ve never done it before. So if I 
fall flat on my face, well, that’s life isn’t it. You just have to laugh
and get over it.’

However, she appeared to let slip her true feelings about the beating 
her rivals in another interview with Women’s Fitness magazine, which 
went on sale yesterday.

Asked if Strictly would bring out her competitive side, she told the 
magazine: ‘Oh God, yeah! I mean, I’d like to be good at the next thing I
choose to do, but I don’t have to be.

‘I don’t have years and years of experience, but obviously I always try 
my best at whatever I do. I want to do it as fast and efficiently as 
possible, and better than anyone else there. It’s just my instinct.’
