'Revenge porn': New York Jets linebacker Jermaine Cunningham, who has been charged with sharing explicit photos of a female friend

New York Jets linebacker Jermaine Cunningham is embroiled in the latest high-profile case of so-called 'revenge porn' after he was charged with sharing explicit photos of a woman.

The Union County prosecutor's office said Cunningham was arrested December 29 in Summit, New Jersey, and charged with invasion of privacy, criminal mischief and unlawful weapons transport.

They allege Cunningham violated a law that forbids disclosing photos or videos without the consent of someone 'whose intimate parts are exposed' or who is engaged in a sex act.

They told the Associated Press Cunningham had lived with the woman involved. It wasn't immediately known how or where the images were shared.

Cunningham was arrested at his apartment after police responded to a 911 call from someone nearby at about 4.15pm, Union County Prosecutor's office spokesman Mark Spivey told NJ.com.

Mr Spivey said the criminal mischief charge was in connection with alleged destruction of clothes belonging to the former resident, who had been in a relationship with Cunningham.

Cunningham was released without bail. It wasn't immediately known if he had an attorney. 

A Summit phone number wasn't listed for Cunningham.

The criminal mischief and invasion of privacy charges are third-degree offenses that can be punished by prison sentences of up to five years upon conviction.

The unlawful weapons transport charge came after a loaded .38-calibre handgun was found in Cunningham's Audi, a prosecutor's spokesman said. Police seized the weapon.

New Jersey led the U.S. in tackling so-called 'revenge porn', with its 10-year-old law the first in the nation to criminalise spreading sexual images of someone without their consent.

Tom Haydon of NJ.com writes cites lawyers familiar with such invasions of privacy who say the increasing prevalence of camera phones and popularity of social media has nevertheless made it a growing problem.

Brooklyn lawyer Carrie Goldberg told him that although the practise is commonly dubbed 'revenge porn', in effect that's actually a catch-all phrase referring to disclosure of sexual pictures without consent.

'Regardless of the motive, the harm and humiliation to the victim are the same,' Ms Goldberg said.

Cunningham, a fifth-year professional, missed last season with a torn Achilles tendon. 

Sports Illustrated reports that he was originally picked by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 2010 NFL draft.  He appeared in 36 games for the Patriots, recording 3.5 sacks, before being cut during training camp in 2013. 

The New York Jets said it was aware of the charges but declined to comment on the arrest. Cunningham is expected to appear in court within the next few weeks.
