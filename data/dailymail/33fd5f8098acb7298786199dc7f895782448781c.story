There was a time when a cosmonaut returning to Earth would be feted as a national hero and showered with medals.

These days, however, it seems the reward is something rather more modest... a watermelon.

Russia's Oleg Artemyev was presented with the fruit yesterday after returning from a six-month posting aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

The crew had reportedly developed a craving for apples and watermelons, which they hoped would help quench their thirst upon landing.

By contrast Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, was given numerous honours and treated to a huge reception in Red Square after touching down in 1961.

The Russian Soyuz capsule that landed in Kazakhstan yesterday also contained US astronaut Steve Swanson and a second cosmonaut, Alexander Skvortsov. 

Riding inside a Russian Soyuz capsule, the three landed southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan at 0223 Wednesday GMT.

Rob Navias, a NASA mission commentator, said it was a 'a pinpoint touchdown'.

The men rode home in the same Soyuz capsule that carried them to the station in March.

Mr Swanson said: 'We accomplished a lot. We've had a lot of fun.'

In addition to a pair of Russian space walks, the returning crew tackled a record number of science experiments, upgraded the station's prototype humanoid robot and repaired broken equipment.

'We did a lot of maintenance, which is good and bad,' Mr Swanson said. 'I love doing maintenance, but it means things broke.'

New station commander Max Suraev remains aboard the orbital outpost along with NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman and the European Space Agency's Alexander Gerst.

Three new crew members, including the first Russian woman to serve on the station, are due to launch on September 25.

During their time aboard the space station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, human behavior and performance, and studies of bone and muscle physiology.

One of the key areas was also human health management for long duration space travel - NASA and Roscosmos are currently preparing for two crew members to spend an entire year aboard the ISS laboratory in 2015.

During their time on ISS, the crew members orbited Earth more than 2,700 times, traveled more than 71.7million miles and welcomed five different cargo spacecraft.

Mr Swanson also ventured outside for a spacewalk to replace a backup computer relay box that unexpectedly failed, while Mr Skvortsov and Mr Artemyev conducted two spacewalks totaling 12 hours and 34 minutes.

Having completed his third space station mission, Mr Swanson now has spent a total of 196 days in space. Mr Skvortsov has accumulated 345 days in space on two flights, and Mr Artemyev accrued 169 days in space on what was his first mission. 

'Getting three new faces up here will be lots of fun,' Mr Wiseman said in an in-flight interview.

The newcomers are NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore and cosmonauts Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova - who will become only the fourth Russian woman to fly in space and the first to serve on the ISS.

The last Russian woman to fly in space was Yelena Kondakova, who was part of a NASA space shuttle crew in May 1997.
