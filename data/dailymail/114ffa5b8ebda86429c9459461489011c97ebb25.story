A British cyclist has been killed on one of the best known roads in the Alps after a collision with a motorist, who was also British.

Joe Pether, 53, was cycling down the steep descent from the French mountain resort of Alpe d’Huez on a stretch of road famed for its 21 hairpin bends and is often part of the Tour de France route.

Mr Pether, from Lower Sunbury, Surrey, collided head-on with the car at one of the road's sharp turns on Sunday evening.

Sharp turns: Joe Pether, 53, from Surrey was killed while cycling down from Alpe d'Huez on a stretch of road  famous for its hairpin bends (pictured). He collided head-on with a motorist, who was also a British tourist

Police carried out a breath test on the motorist but it was negative.

A local police spokeswoman from said: 'An investigation has been opened. We heard from witnesses on Monday morning but the inquiry is ongoing.

'Tragically the victim died at the scene.

'He was a British tourist, as was the driver of the vehicle. They were both tourists.'

Police are investigating Sunday’s crash and examining a theory that the driver, 50, approached the turn too widely.

The road attracts both cyclists and motorcyclists in large numbers, seeking to conquer the steep 13km stretch.

Well-known: The stretch of road is often included as part of the Tour de France route. Last year a British bus driver was killed and three passengers injured after their bus crashed on the same part of the road

Last year a British driver of a coach carrying resort staff back to the UK was killed on the same stretch of road and three people were critically injured.

The bus, with 53 people on board, was on the descent when it careered off a hairpin bend and erupted in flames.

Witnesses told police that moments before the crash, driver Maurice Wrightson, 64, from Northumberland, had frantically tried to warn passengers that there was a catastrophic problem with the brakes.
