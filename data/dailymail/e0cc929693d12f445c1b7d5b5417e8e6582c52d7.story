Michael Owen is currently out in Taiwan as part of his Spey Whiskey promotional tour and arrived at the press conference in true showmanship style as he self-promotes the brand.

The former Liverpool striker was the butt of many jokes after his advert for the whiskey was released and his apperance in Taipei certainly caught the eye. 

Owen turned up to the press meeting in a horse and carriage before posing for photos and showing off the ball skills which earned him a big-money move to Real Madrid.

The ex-England international is a popular figure in Asia and as the global ambassador for Spey, he's been a real driving force behind their attempts to boost sales in that part of the world.

The striker, whose been criticised in the past for being 'boring,' then decided to try and show his comical side by posting a rather bizarre photo.

Lying on the deck next to a sign for the 'MO Bar,' Owen took up what some might call 'The Austin Powers' pose before captioning the image, 'Just arrived at my bar!!!'
