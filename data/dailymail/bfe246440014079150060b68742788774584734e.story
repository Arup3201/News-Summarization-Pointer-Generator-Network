Belfast-born John Cole left £816,563 in his will 

Former BBC political editor John Cole left £816,563 in his will.

Belfast-born Cole, who died last year aged 85, was famed for his reporting during Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and known for his fast-paced Ulster accent.

The father of four left the bulk of his estate to his wife Madge, whom he married in 1956 and his sons - Donald, Patrick, David and Michael - and nine grandchildren.

Cole was BBC political editor from 1981 to 1992, covering the Brighton bomb, the Westland affair and the miner's strike. 

He also predicted the Iron Lady’s downfall.

The Labour-supporter died at his sleep at his home in Claygate, Surrey on November 7, 2013.

He had been diagnosed with cancer four years previous and subsequently developed aphasia.

He had suffered other health problems in his retirement including heart problems and a stroke.
