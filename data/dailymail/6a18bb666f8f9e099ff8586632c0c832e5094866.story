Manchester United are considering a summer move for Wolfsburg defender Ricardo Rodriguez, claims the player's agent.

Rodriguez has been one of Wolfsburg's key players during an impressive campaign for the German club and has pitched in with six goals so far, including a stunning free-kick against Everton last September. 

The Swiss star's agent Gianluca di Domenico has now revealed that Wolfsburg will attempt to keep hold of their man despite rumoured interest from Louis van Gaal's side.

He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'I can say that United have called for information, but that Wolfsburg do not want to give in. With Real there was nothing official.'

The 22-year-old had been linked with United last summer before the Old Trafford side swooped for former Southampton youngster Luke Shaw. 

Shaw has made a steady start to his Red Devils career, but will no doubt be looking to nail down a first team place ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season. The signing of Rodriguez could make life more complicated for the English left-back.
