California's notorious 'Pillowcase Rapist,' who attacked 38 women from the early 1970's to the late 1990's may be released from a state mental hospital in the next few weeks.

The California State Supreme Court denied the District Attorney's petition to block Christopher Hubbart's, now 62, release when he comes up for parole.

Now in light of this new ruling, Hubbart, who earned his nickname by putting pillow cases over his female victims heads in order to muffle their screams, may once again be walking the streets where he one-time victims still live.

Christopher Hubbart, the California Pillowcase Rapist is set to be released from a state mental institution in a few weeks

Hubbart, has spent nearly two decades in and out of mental institution after he was convicted of assaulted 38 women throughout the state between 1971 and 1982.

District
Attorney Jackie Lacey, who's petition was denied by the court, is now seeking to have Hubbart released in a county other than Los Angeles, where he committed his most recent crimes, according to Fox News.

'We aggressively pursued and exhausted all legal avenues to stop the 
release of sexually violent predator Christopher Hubbart to Los Angeles 
County,' Lacey said according to the news organization.

'We now are 
committed to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure that 
all terms and conditions of Hubbart's release from custody are strictly 
enforced. We will do everything within our power to keep all members of 
our community safe from harm.'

Yet officials say that when Hubbart is released the public has nothing to fear as he will be closely monitored.

"Any sex offender, especially one that's a serial rapist, would be 
subject to 24-hour supervision with a GPS ankle bracelet, register (as a
sex offender) and be placed under very strong special conditions of 
parole," California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Luis Patino told The Los Angeles Daily News.

Officials say that a guard will also be posted outside of his place of residence to closely monitor his movements.

However if Hubbart cannot find permanent housing monitoring him will be made much harder Santa Clara County 
Deputy District Attorney Vonda Tracey told The Huffington Post.

'It’s more ideal, from a
public safety standpoint, to have him in one location instead of moving
around,' Tracey told the website.

Hubbart has been convicted of sexually assaulting over three dozen women

Hubbart has a long history of sexual violence with Lacey had detailed in his petition to the supreme court, Fox News reported.

'He first sexually assaulted a woman when he was a senior in high 
school; he reached out and touched her breast as she was walking by' the petition reprinted by Fox News states. 'He repeated that type of assault seven or eight 
times before 1971, and about eight to nine times after he started 
college in 1971. He would sometime follow women home.'

The following year Hubbart committed 26 assaults on women in the Los Angeles area.

'He would drive around in the early morning and look for homes that 
had garage doors open, indicating the man of the house had gone to 
work,' the petition says. 'He would also look for children’s toys, 
believing that mothers would be protective of their children and more 
likely to cooperate with him. He would bind the women’s hand and cover 
their faces, then sexually assault them.'

Hubbart was locked away for his crimes in state hospital, however in 1979 the doctors there deemed him to longer be a public threat.

Hubbart was released and moved to the San Francisco area where he soon began attacking more women. He was quickly re-convicted and recommitted to a mental facility.

He was once again released in 1990, but was sent back to prison after attacking a female jogger, Fox News reported.

In 1996, Hubbart was declared a 'sexually violent predator,' which is a diagnosed mental disorder for people who have been convicted of sexually violent crimes and pose a threat to the safety of others.

Hubbart's attorney, Santa Clara County Deputy Public Defender Jeff 
Dunn, did not return Fox New's call for comment, but has spoken out in the past in favor of his client's release.

The news organization reported that last month Dunn publicly stated that his client is 'no longer a public safety risk.'
