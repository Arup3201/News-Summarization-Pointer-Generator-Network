Nick Clegg will promise tax cuts, a crackdown on foreign workers who cannot speak English and free childcare at the next election, secret documents reveal.

The Lib Dems' red lines for a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour were revealed as photographers snapped papers carried by the party's strategy chief Ryan Coetzee as he left a meeting in Westminster.

The front page demands include tackling the deficit, an income tax cut worth £400, increasing spending on mental health and protecting budgets for nurseries, schools and colleges from cuts.

The front page of the Lib Dem manifesto, which will carry the red lines for a new coalition in 2015, were revealed in documents captured by photographers

It includes a promise to balance the budget, cut income tax by £400, improve mental health care and protect spending on nurseries, schools and colleges from cuts

Senior Lib Dems met today to discuss the blueprint for the party's pitch to voters in May 2015.

It came hours after Mr Clegg admitted the party risks appearing 'invisible' to the public as the smaller party in the coalition.

However, he hopes that a small list of eye-catching policies will win enough support to ensure his party again holds the balance of power.

Mr Coetzee was photographed leaving Mr Clegg's Whitehall HQ this afternoon clutching copies of the draft manifesto.

South African Mr Coetzee is paid £110,000 as head of strategy and spends much of his time advising Mr Clegg on how to boost the Lib Dems’ dismal poll ratings. One poll yesterday put them behind the Green party.

The document he was carrying states: 'Only the Liberal Democrats will create the opportunity for everyone by building a stronger economy and a fairer society.'

It promises to 'balance the budget' by 2018, bringing down Britain's debts. There is a pledge of an income tax cut worth £400-a-year for low and middle earners by increasing the income tax threshold to £12,500 paid for by increasing taxes on the richest.

The promises include language tests for benefits claimants, increased childcare for all children and help for renters to buy their own home

Nick Clegg has revealed he would like to install a webcam inside Number 10 to film his rows with David Cameron.

The Lib Dem leader admitted that being in the smaller party of a coalition meant he was at risk of being 'invisible' to voters.

It came as a poll put the Lib Dems behind the Green party for the first time, raising fresh fears Mr Clegg's party will be hammered in next year's general election.

In other European countries, the smaller coalition party has often paid a heavier price at the ballot box.

Voters often choose to punish them for breaking promises while the larger party is able to claim credit for the good news.

Mr Clegg said it was a problem the Lib Dems face but insisted he had not disappeared from view and suggested a live internet feed to record his influence in the corridors of power.

He told ITV's The Agenda: 'I certainly accept, and you see this across Europe, the fate of smaller parties in coalition. 

'Sometimes I wish I could persuade David Cameron to have a webcam.'

However he also admitted: 'I don't think that's going to happen.'

On mental health, there will be guaranteed waiting times equal to physical health conditions.

And on education it promises every child will have a qualified teacher, with spending protected for nurseries, schools and colleges.

This goes much further than the Tory promise to protect the schools budget from cuts.

The four areas will be seen as 'red lines' for the Lib Dems to enter a new power-sharing deal with Labour or the Tories.

However, a second page of pledges will be regarded as key demands for a future coalition.

They include an ambitious promise to offer up to 20 hours free childcare for almost all pre-school children by 2020.

Under the plan, all parents with children aged two to four will be offered 20 hours of free childcare every week.

At present, all three and four year olds get 15 hours a week, with the poorest 40 per cent of two year-olds also getting 15 hours.

In a major extension of the promise, the Lib Dems will say that eventually the 20 hours should also be offered to all toddlers over the age of 9 months, as long as both parents are working.

Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Liberal Democrats want to help families with childcare support and nursery education right the way through from the end of parental leave to the start of school.'

The document, photographed outside the Scotland Office on Whitehall, also reveals the Lib Dems are planning to toughen their stance on immigration.

All new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance will have their English skills assessed, and those who are considered to have 'poor' English will have their benefits cut unless they take language lessons.

There is also a promise to 'bring back proper border checks so we know who's coming in and leaving the UK, allowing the government to identify and deport people who over-stay their visa'.  

On housing, more help is promised for people struggling to get on to the property ladder.

It includes a 'new model of affordable housing' where rent payments earn a stake in a home, 'creating a path to home ownership for lower income working families'.

Under-21s are promised to pay just a third of their bus fares so they can get to college or work.

Other pledges include a £250 'Carer's Bonus', a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2million and at least one GP in every area open from 7am to 7pm, seven days-a-week.

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'The fact that the key sentence on this document is 'only the Liberal Democrats will create opportunity for everyone by building a stronger economy and a fairer society' shouldn't surprise anyone.

'The public will have already heard it many times from us and everyone will be hearing a lot more about it between now and May.

'The subjects mentioned – tax, mental health and education – were the key themes of Nick Clegg's Conference speech. And unlike Ed Miliband, we think tackling the deficit should be a top priority for the next government.

'Like all political parties, we're currently discussing our priorities for the next Parliament and we'll provide more details in due course.'
