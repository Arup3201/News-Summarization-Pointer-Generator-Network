New signing Esteban Cambiasso is already having a huge impact at Leicester City, according to teammate Danny Drinkwater.

The former Real Madrid and Inter Milan midfielder signed for the Foxes as a free agent in the summer and his experience and medal collection have instantly warmed him to his new teammates.

Drinkwater insists that having such an illustrious name around the training ground can only be a benefit to the club.
