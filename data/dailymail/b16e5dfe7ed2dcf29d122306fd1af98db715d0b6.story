Venezuela has declared the United States to be an 'imminent danger' at the launch of two weeks of Cold War-style military drills and parades featuring weapons made in Russia and China.

Chanting 'socialist motherland' and branding the U.S. 'imperialist', 80,000 military staff and 20,000 civilians took the streets of the capital Caracas for anti-American protests on Saturday afternoon.

The Venezuelan parliament followed the protests by yesterday approving a law giving embattled President Nicolas Maduro the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what were described as 'American threats' to the South American nation.

The launch of two weeks of military drills came just days after Barack Obama declared Venezuela a national security threat, restricted travel to the nation and froze the assets of some citizens of a nation already struggling with a widespread shortage of goods.

Yesterday Venezuela's parliament approved a law giving Maduro the power to legislate by decree for nine months in the face of what he described as threats by the U.S. government.

The so-called 'anti-imperialist' law will be in effect from the time it is published in Venezuela's Official Gazette until December 31.

Maduro requested the expanded powers in response to new U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan officials accused of human rights violations. Critics of Venezuela's government have called the move a power grab.

The U.S. is targeting officials in the top echelon of Venezuela's security apparatus responsible for cracking down on last year's anti-government protests and for pursuing charges against opponents. The officials will be denied U.S. visas and have their U.S. assets frozen.

The leaders of South America's leftist governments have come out in support of Venezuela, while Washington has denied Maduro's claim that it is seeking to undermine his government and urged him to focus on Venezuela's domestic problems, including food shortages and soaring inflation.

The two weeks of military drills are widely seen as Maduro's attempt to stir up patriotic sentiment in the hope of improving his falling approval rating ahead of key parliamentary elections later this year.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Carlos Romero, a professor of international relations at the Central University of Venezuela, said Washington's declaration of the nation as a national security threat has 'worked very well for the Venezuelan government'.

He said Venezuela had used the announcement to 'trumpet up support' for the government by reacting in 'an exaggerated, almost dramatic' manner.

Maduro has previously claimed that the United States, which remains Venezuela's largest cash-generating oil export market, has backed attempts to remove him from power.

In 2002 a coup that had the tacit support of America briefly ousted the late Hugo Chávez - Maduro's charismatic mentor and presidential predecessor.
