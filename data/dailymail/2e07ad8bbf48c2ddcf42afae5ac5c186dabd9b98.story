Up to 50 troops are living at a £100-a-night hotel at taxpayers’ expense because there are not enough beds at their barracks.

Around 20 Royal Marines and 30 Royal Navy personnel have been booked into the three-star Holiday Inn in Plymouth, four miles from the Devonport naval base.

The hotel, near the city centre, has a restaurant, sauna, steam room, gym and satellite television. Members of the group are each receiving £25 food vouchers a day and have boasted of dining ‘on fillet steak every night’.

Lucky manoeuvre: Around 50 troops, including marines like those pictured, are being housed in the Plymouth Holiday Inn

The revelation provoked anger as the Ministry of Defence has pushed through crippling military cuts, including axing 30,000 troops, fighter jets and warships, in a bid to save around £43billion.

It also emerged as Prime Minister David Cameron defended the belt-tightening during an appearance before a Parliamentary committee.

The MoD yesterday insisted that it was 'extremely rare' to put up troops in hotels.

The story came to light after three Royal Marines enjoying a sauna at the Holiday Inn told another guest of the situation.

According to the men they had been placed at the hotel 'indefinitely'.

The man said: 'They seemed to be enjoying themselves. They told me some of them were going to Nando's every night.

Lap of luxury: The marines, who are given a £25 food voucher every day, boasted of eating fillet steak every night

'But in a time of defence cutbacks sticking 50 troops in a hotel seems like madness.

'It must be costing so much money to put them up there. The hotel is three star and they said they're getting a £25 food vouchers a day.

'It seems crazy they're in a hotel just four miles away from the barracks just because the military can't get their act together.'

Defence sources insisted the MoD had negotiated a special discount rate for the rooms of about £50 a night. The situation is expected to last 'a few days', they said.

Insiders said there were not enough beds at barracks because there had been an influx of troops passing through Devonport.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Due to a slight increase in the requirement for accommodation in Plymouth we can confirm that a limited number of Navy personnel are staying at a local hotel.

'We can be clear that this is only a temporary arrangement to ensure their duties can be carried out and a special rate was secured to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.'
