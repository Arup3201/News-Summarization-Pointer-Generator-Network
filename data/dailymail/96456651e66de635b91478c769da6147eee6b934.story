These are the shocking injuries inflicted on Miss Harrison by  Stenhouse who beat her with nine times with the rubber mallet, with five of the blows striking her head

Miss Harrison eventually managed to escape the attack by tricking Stenhouse, then 38, into letting her into her daughter's bedroom, where she was able to block the door and call 999.

Stenhouse ran away as police arrived, but was tracked down and arrested. He was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Reading Crown Court after admitting grievous bodily harm and false imprisonment.

Miss Harrison and Stenhouse had separated in January 2013 and he had visited her to collect his items on March 5 of that year.   

In the intermittent period she had become close to a work colleague, Damien Selleck, 31, who supported her through her ordeal and who she has since married and whose name she has taken.

Miss Harrison said she blacked out as Stenhouse attacked her with the rubber mallet. When she came round he tied her up with security cables

Speaking publicly for the first time since Stenhouse, then 38, of no fixed address, was jailed for in August 2013, she said: 'I remember shielding my face and seeing Darren was holding a rubber mallet.

'He hit me once, then another eight times including five times to the head.

'I dropped to the blood-splattered floor and blacked out.

'When I came round, Darren was holding plastic padlocks and chains.

'He said he'd bought them earlier that day to use on me.

'He tied my arms and legs with metal security cables.

Miss Harrison said she had tried to shield her face as Stenhouse attacked her

Miss Harrison tried to tell Stenhouse she loved him to 'get him on side' and make him stop

Stenhouse had told Miss Harrison (pictured during their relationship) that she had betrayed him by speaking to other men

'He told me his friends were coming round, "to have fun with me". I was petrified.

'There were tears running down my face. I begged him to stop.'

She told how she knew she had to 'get him on side'.

'I told him I loved him and we could make the relationship work,' she revealed.

'But he just shouted at me.

'He said, "If I stop this, I'll be arrested".

'He then said, "This is going to end with you in a box".

'He said he had duct tape and knives to cut me up until I was unrecognisable.

'He said he planned to hurt me in front of my kids, to torment them.'

The mother-of-three's children Iisha, now 13, Kenzie, now seven and Morgan, now five, were at nursery and school when the attack took place

Mrs Selleck's children, Iisha, now 13, Kenzie, now seven and Morgan, now five, were at nursery and school.

She continued: 'When I asked why he was doing this, he said I'd betrayed him by speaking to other men.

'I remember lying on the kitchen floor, aching.

'I wanted to close my eyes and give up but I couldn't stop thinking about my poor kids.

Miss Harrison was able to escape by barricading herself in her daughter's bedroom , and calling 999

'So I forced myself to stay awake, and planned my escape.'

Stenhouse had not realised that she had her mobile phone in her pocket, and Mrs Selleck realised could help her escape. 

'I decided I would lock myself in the bathroom and call the police,' she said. 'I asked Darren if I could use the toilet so he untied me and guided me there. Then I remembered there was no reception so I asked to lie down.

'Darren steered me toward Iisha's room, but I knew there was a table in mine that I could use to barricade the door.

'So I said I didn't want to get blood on her sheets. Darren took me to my room, then asked where my phone was.

'I couldn't believe he hadn't searched me. I lied and said it was in Iisha's room.

'As he disappeared, I realised he must think I was too hurt to run away.

'But I found the strength to get up to block the door and then I called the police.'

She said she yelled, "Come now or I am going to die," down the phone.

'Darren tried to break in,' she said. 'But as the police arrived he ran away.

'They searched the area for him.'

She was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital and Stenhouse was found nearby and arrested.

'Blood was pouring from my head,' she said. 'The next day I was allowed home. The children were terrified of my swollen face, but eventually they let me hug them.'

Afterwards she found support in her old work colleague Mr Selleck.

'Damien was handsome and kind,' she said. 'He acted nothing like Darren.

'In July he proposed.'

She described how Stenhouse had been violent before the hammer attack – but she had always taken him back.

After splitting with Stenhouse, Miss Harrison became close to a work colleague, Damien Selleck, 31, who supported her through her ordeal and who she has since married and whose name she has taken

Mr Selleck with his wife's three children. She says her new love has made her realise that men should never be violent towards their partners

'When we met in a nightclub in Aylesbury in 2009 he was loving and gentle,' she said. 'We spent every minute together and he got on with my children.

'But a few weeks later, while down the pub, he told me to get out.

'But he came outside to say sorry, and I thought he'd just had too many drinks.

'But a few months later I realised Darren snapped whenever he drank. I asked if he had a problem but he said no.

'He apologised for hurting me and I believed him.

'But he carried on calling me names and I always walked around on egg shells with him. He hit me when my kids went to bed too.

'I should have left, but Darren never hurt them and I loved him, despite him making me feel worthless. He said no-one else would ever love me.

'In March 2011, Darren smashed a cricket ball against the side of my head.' On this occasion Stenhouse appeared at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court where he admitted a count of common assault and was jailed for 22 weeks.

The moment Mr Selleck asked Miss Harrison to marry him last July

After he was released she took him back.

'I hoped it would be a new start but then he began being verbally abusive,' she said.

'Being called a fat ugly whore didn't leave a mark like a bruise, but it hurt just as much.

'I left in January 2013.'

Now she wants other women to leave violent partners.

'People need to pack their bags and leave,' she said. 'Damien made me realise that you should never let your partner be violent.

'I realise Darren manipulated me.

'He made me feel like I didn't have a future without him.

'I've told Iisha not to stand for any man's abuse.

'I don't want her ever to suffer like I did.

'I feel lucky to be alive.

'Had Darren found my phone, I wouldn't have been able to escape and he could have eventually killed me.

'I urge victims of domestic abuse to tell someone.

'Don't live in silence and fear like me. Get help before it's too late.'
