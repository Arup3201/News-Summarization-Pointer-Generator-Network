If a wild cheer from the crowd is a sportsman’s greatest reward then spare a thought for the youngsters of Yorkshire this weekend.

For in an unprecedented move rugby bosses have ordered that all youth games have to be played in complete silence.

The bizarre rule has been introduced in an attempt to improve behaviour on the touchlines after a spate of unsavoury incidents. Officials said that referees are increasingly becoming targets for abuse from aggressive parents during games.

The ban will affect spectators, parents and coaches, with only the players on the field permitted to make any noise.

But as well as banning shouting and chanting, officials have told spectators that they are not even allowed to applaud impressive play on the pitch.

The ‘Silent Sundays’ initiative has been approved by the Rugby Football Union, with former Lions coach Sir Ian McGeechan also backing the plan.

It is unclear how Yorkshire RFU will apply the rules, but the letter they sent to clubs complained that a ‘small minority’ were forgetting rugby’s ‘core values’ when attending games at weekends.

It went on to say: ‘Some referees are being verbally abused and we are finding it harder to recruit new referees because of this. And junior players who leave the game have highlighted this pitch-side pressure as a reason for giving up.’

Last year the Football Association started offering courses to parents caught swearing during children’s football matches.

The three-hour sessions include a quiz designed to show parents ‘that they do not know the rules better than the referee’.
