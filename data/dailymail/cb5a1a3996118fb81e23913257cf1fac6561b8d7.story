Animals come in all shapes and sizes and now scientists have demonstrated how their form affects their perception of moving objects.

By studying a variety of animals, researchers have discovered that a creature’s body mass and metabolic rate dictates how it perceives the speed of a moving object - or person.

They found that a dog and housefly see movements more slowly than a human, while a rat and a cat see movement more quickly.

To examine how animals experience the passing of time, the scientists examined how fast they could see a light flash in a second (Hz).

The higher the number, the slower time seems to move for the animals.

The scientists, from the School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, said that speed perception depends on how fast an animal’s nervous system processes information in order to react to its environment.

To investigate, they showed 34 types of vertebrates, including fish, birds, lizards and mammals, a flashing light.

If the light flashes fast enough, both humans and animals see it as a constant beam, Scientific American reported.

By measuring an animal’s brain activity, they examined the highest frequency that it saw the light flashing.

To animals that can see the light flashing at higher speeds, it is as if movements and situations unfold more slowly, according to the study, published in the journal Animal Behaviour.

The team think that this is advantageous to animals that need to avoid obstacles or predators quickly.

For example, chipmunks and pigeons can see a light flash 100 times a second, while cats see it flash 55 times a second.

By studying an array of different animals, a team of researchers discovered that a creature’s body mass and metabolic rate dictates how they experience the passing of time. This means that a mouse (pictured left) experiences the world and time very different than an elephant, (left) for example

Animals that could see the light flash at high speeds were found to have faster metabolisms, confirming the scientists’ hypothesis that the species that can see objects move at a higher frequency of flashes tend to be smaller.

A dog can take in visual information – 
and see a light flashing – 25 per cent faster than a human, and while 
this makes it seem that time moves more slowly for canines, it is not 
enough to mean that one dog year equates to seven human years, they added .

The study demonstrates that a mouse sees the world and experiences time in a very different way to an elephant, for example.

The connection between the perception of time and a creature’s body size and metabolism suggests that different nervous systems have evolved based upon a species’ environment and how they survive in the wild.

Smaller animals that need to avoid predators quickly tend to see events unfolding more slowly, but this is not an absolute rule

Dogs take in visual information 25 per cent faster than humans, which makes time move more slowly for them
