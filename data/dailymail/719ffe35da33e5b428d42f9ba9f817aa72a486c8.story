A man is facing the death penalty for the murder of his stepson after the child suffered severe abuse.

Nathan Sloop, 34, is charged with  aggravated murder over the death of four-year-old Ethan Stacy in 2010.

Sloop reportedly told police that he had smashed the boy's face and teeth with a hammer to conceal his identity before burying his body off a mountain trail.

The boy died after prolonged beatings, being burned, drugged and starved, authorities said. He was also locked up and left alone by his mother 29-year-old Stephanie Sloop and her husband at their home in Layton, Utah.

Mrs Sloop is also charged with murder but is not facing the death penalty.

Nathan Sloop has pleaded not guilty and is next due in court on December 11 while his wife will appear on December 14.

Between April 29 and May 8, 2010, the couple allegedly severely beat the little boy and failed to get him necessary medical care.

They also allegedly locked him in a bedroom at the home without any food when they went to get married on May 6.

Stephanie Sloop said that she had wanted 
to get her son to a doctor but was afraid that her husband would harm 
her too, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
