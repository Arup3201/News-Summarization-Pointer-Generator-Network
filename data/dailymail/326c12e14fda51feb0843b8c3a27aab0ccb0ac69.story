The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been invited to make an official visit to China early next year, when Kate could be eight months pregnant with the couple's second child. 

Chinese officials are said to be keen for the Royal couple to visit in a bid to improve political and trade relations between the two countries. 

However there are concerns that the Duchess could be nearing eight months pregnant by the time of the visit. 

Clarence House said plans had not yet been made for a visit by the pair and it was too early to confirm whether they would travel to the country. 

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been invited to visit China early next year, but there are concerns that the Duchess's pregnancy could hamper the trip as she is due to give birth to their second child in April

Officials in China are understood to be hopeful that a visit by the couple could take place before April next year, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

Prince George, who turned one in July, is not expected to accompany them. 

Chinese leaders are likely to view a visit by the Duke and Duchess as a way to improve relations between the two countries, which have been strained by visits to the UK by the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, and his relationship with Prince Charles and the Prime Minister. 

In June Li Keqiang, the current Chinese Premier, met the Queen during a visit to Britain. His visit was the first time a Premier had visited the UK since a row in 2012 about David Cameron meeting the Dalai Lama.

However, the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy could affect the trip going ahead. 

She is believed to be around four months pregnant and is due to give birth in April 2015. 

The Queen met Chinese premier Li Keqiang at Windsor Castle in June, the first visit by a Premier since 2012 

This could hamper a possible trip by the couple as most airlines will not transport pregnant women who are more than 36 weeks pregnant.

It is hoped a visit by the couple could be more successful that previous royal trips to the country. 

Prince Charles visited China in 1997 when Hong Kong became part of the country and was rumoured to describe Chinese leaders as 'waxworks.' 

The last time the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh visited was in 1986 when the Duke was overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly.' 

2011 - Shortly after they were married the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made an official tour of Canada. It was the third time Prince William had visited the country and the first for Kate.  

2012 - The couple visited Singapore, Malaysia, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu in September on behalf of the Queen as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Their visit took in eight cities. 

2014 - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, accompanied by Prince George who was nine months old, completed a 19 day royal tour of Australia and New Zealand in April. 

2014 - The Duchess of Cambridge had to cancel her first solo tour to Malta in September because she was suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition. Prince went in place of his wife. 

2014 - The couple are due to visit New York in December and will attend a fundraiser for St Andrew's University at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Mew York.
