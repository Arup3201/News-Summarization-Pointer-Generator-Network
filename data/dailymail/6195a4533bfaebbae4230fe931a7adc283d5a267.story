Thierry Henry believes Arsenal fans demand a lot from the Gunners because of the standard Arsene Wenger has set himself during his time at the club.

The 37-year-old, who spent eight seasons playing under Wenger, said his fellow countryman has transformed Arsenal for the better, despite having not won the league in ten years.

'For me, it's a no brainer,' he said speaking to BBC's Football Focus. 'Was Arsenal successful before? Yes, they were, but in a different way.

Thierry Henry says Arsene Wenger deserves praise for transforming Arsenal into playing attractive football

Henry believes Gunners' fans expect so much of Arsenal because of the standard Wenger set himself 

Henry won seven trophies in eight years working under Wenger in north London

'Now Arsenal is recognised for the type of football they play, and that is all down to him.' 

Henry believes the success that saw him win seven trophies during his time in North London has lead the fans to demand so much from Wenger and his team.

He said: 'When you give people a lot, they get used to it and they just expect and demand [a lot], and rightly so, because when you are at a club like Arsenal people expect and want you to win.'

The Arsenal legend believes that Wenger's current crop is capable of winning the Premier League title but sees Jose Mourinho's Chelsea as a large obstacle to overcome. 

'They do have a squad to win the league,' he said. 'But they are nine points behind Chelsea and somehow you are going to have to make sure you can grab somewhere those points, hoping Chelsea is going to lose somewhere.'

Arsenal haven't won the Premier League in ten years when Henry was a part of the side 

The Frenchman believes, however, that Wenger's current crop are capable of winning the title

To do that they need to find nine points from somewhere to catch Jose Mourinho's Chelsea
