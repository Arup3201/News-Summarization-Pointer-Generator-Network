The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, pictured, magnified the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims, according to the report

Children as young as ten have been responsible for anti-Muslim abuse, a study has claimed.

It suggests that the Muslim community is facing abuse on a daily basis, with many of the attacks carried out by younger people.

And the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby 'clearly magnified' the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims, the study's author has claimed.

The report found that there were 734 self-reported cases of anti-Islamic abuse between May 2013 and February this year - equivalent to more than two a day on average.

Researchers at the Centre for Fascist, Anti-Fascist and Post-Fascist Studies at Teesside University, in Middlesbrough, used data collected over a ten month period by the Tell Mama (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) project.

Separate figures produced by Tell Mama were questioned a year ago when directors of the government-funded project said they had received more than 200 reports of Islamophobia in just over a week after the brutal murder.

It emerged that more than half of the incidents reported on the hotline related to offensive messages on Twitter, Facebook or online blogs, and only a tiny minority were physical attacks.

Nearly 600 of the incidents examined in the separate university study were online abuse and threats.

The rest were 'offline' attacks such as violence, spreading of anti-Muslim literature, threats and assaults.

Around 60 per cent of these 'offline' attacks are believed to have been carried out by individuals estimated to be aged between ten and 30.

The study also suggests that around two fifths of the cases recorded by Tell MAMA had a link to far-right groups.

It found that more than half of the victims reporting incidents to the project were women, while less than one in six of all of those who reported incidents also told the police.

Study author Dr Matthew Feldman, co-director of the Centre for Fascist, Anti-Fascist and Post-Fascist Studies said: 'Muslims remain among the most likely minority group in Britain to be targeted for a hate crime.

‘"Trigger" events like the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby clearly magnify the possibility of far-right groups and others victimising Muslims simply for who they are and what they believe.”

The report noted a spike in reported incidents in the wake of Fusilier Rigby’s murder in Woolwich, south east London on May 22 last year.

The soldier’s death sparked shock across the country after he was run over with a car and then hacked to death by British Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

In the week after the murder, there were 127 reported incidents, according to Tell Mama’s figures, while a total of 354 cases of anti-Muslim activity were reported in May and June last year.

A number of attacks received widespread coverage at the time alongside warnings from Tell Mama Project director Fiyaz Mughal of a ‘cycle of violence’ against Muslims which had led to ‘a sense of endemic fear’.

But while they included a petrol bomb attack on a mosque in Grimsby and another incident in Essex where a man entered a mosque armed with a knife, only 17 cases involved individuals being physically targeted, it was claimed in a Sunday newspaper at the time.

Six people had things thrown at them and most of the other 11 incidents related to attempts to rip off women’s headscarves or other items of Islamic dress.

More than half related to offensive or abusive messages on social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter.
