Thailand is renowned for its delicious curries and mouthwatering noodle dishes - so much so, many restaurants attempt to replicate these national cuisines, but with limited success.

In a bid to clamp down on poorly made, bland meals, the Thai government has stepped in and created its Thai Delicious program.

The initiative will use an app to find authentic recipes, alongside a so-called ‘e-delicious’ machine to test dishes across the country.

The Thai Delicious program was setup to improve meals across Thailand. Its ‘e-delicious machine’ (illustrated) features 10 sensors that identify taste signatures for dishes, by measuring the conductivity of the samples at different voltages. Dishes are then given an authenticity score out of 100

The Thai Delicious program uses an app to store authentic recipes.

Its so-called ‘e-delicious’ machine is then taken to restaurants to test samples of  dishes.

The machine has a total of 10 taste sensors. 

Each recipe has a unique signature, and, using these sensors, the machine can identify the signature of tested dishes. 

These signatures are created by measuring the conductivity of the food samples at different voltages.

The two signatures, or electrical readings, are compared to one another, to achieve an authenticity score, out of 100. 

A score lower than 80 is a poor replica.

Each authentic recipe has a unique signature, and, using these sensors, the machine can also identify the signature of tested dishes.

Any dish that scores lower than 80 is deemed a poor replica. 

But those that score highly are given an award of authenticity.

This includes a sticker that can be placed in the windows of restaurants.

The technical specifications have not been revealed, but Nakah Thawichawatt, a Thai businessman involved in the project, told the New York Times the machines cost around £11,000 ($18,000) each.

During tests, the New York Times used the machine to discover the authenticity of a green curry from the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand.

Last week, PhD student Joana Guerreiro from Aarhus University in Denmark released details of a nanosensor (pictured) that performs a similar ‘taste’ test for wine. Dubbed 'mini-mouth', the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and how astringent it is

Last week, PhD student Joana Guerreiro from Aarhus University in Denmark released details of a nanosensor that performs a similar ‘taste’ test for wine.

Dubbed 'mini-mouth', the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and, in particular, how astringent it is.

The sensor uses salivary proteins to measure the sensation that would be felt on a human mouth. The researchers study how the proteins change in the interaction with the wine, and they can use this to describe the effect of the wine.

It involves an app for storing authentic recipes and an ‘e-delicious machine’

@highlight

E-delicious has 10 sensors that create taste readings on an electrical scale

@highlight

This creates a dish ‘signature’ that can be compared to an original recipe

@highlight

The machine then gives the dish a score out of 100 - and anything lower than 80 is considered poor quality

Restaurants that serve authentic Thai dishes receive an authenticity award
