Comedian Joan Rivers was quizzed by a squad of balaclava-clad UK Border Agency officials - after being mistaken for an illegal immigrant.

Four guards swooped as the American star enjoyed a weekend fishing trip while filming her latest reality show.

The Border Agency officials had been alerted about a suspicious group of people on two fishing trawlers on the Swale Estuary in Kent - a well-known spot for attempts at illegal immigration.

Mistaken identity: Joan Rivers, pictured with her film crew on a fishing boat, was recording an episode for her US reality television show during a visit to Lees Court Estate in Kent to see her friend the Countess Sondes

Sense of humour: Despite the mix-up Rivers, pictured with her daughter Melissa and members of her team, saw the funny side and was 'hilarious' throughout

Despite the mix-up, Rivers managed to hang on to her notorious sense of humour.

She said: 'Even though we were innocent I am so sorry they didn't arrest us. I love Englishmen and they were very cute.'

The 79-year-old was visiting her friend, and fellow New Yorker, the Countess Sones at the 6,900 acre Lees Court Estate in Faversham, Kent, which she owns.

Border Agency officers, dressed in black, quizzed Sondes, Rivers and her daughter Melissa who were filming Joan and Melissa, Joan Knows Best! for US television.

After the discussion the Border Agency allowed Rivers to go back to work.

Lady Sondes said: 'Given the Lees Court 
Estate's close involvement with the Swale, it was a great comfort to 
know that the Border Agency acted in a pro-active, efficient and 
friendly manner.'

A spokeswoman for the estate added: 'It was all very dramatic. Joan was hilarious throughout the whole time she was with us.

'The Border Agency did not have the same sense of humour - they understandably took the situation very seriously.

'They were all dressed in black and were wearing balaclavas but you could still see their face - they were very efficient not the sort of people you would want to mess with.

'But they were very professional and did a fantastic job - it's great to know people like that are protecting our shores.'

The UK Border Agency yesterday confirmed the incident on October 20, but denied they were acting on a tip off.

A spokeswoman said officers spotted the vessel while on routine patrol.

She said: 'Our officers will investigate any potential immigration or customs offences and take swift and robust action to ensure our borders remain secure.

'On October 20, 2012, whilst on routine patrol, Her Majesty's Cutter Vigilant approached a fishing vessel in the Swale Estuary, Kent.

'Border Force officers spoke with the captain of the vessel to establish ownership and number of passengers.

'After a short discussion, Border Force officers were satisfied the passengers and crew did not present a risk to the border.

'The search of any vessel in UK territorial seas and internal waters plays an important role in protecting the border.

'Presently there is no means of establishing, with any certainty, where a vessel has come from until Border Force officers have spoken to the captain, crew and in some cases boarded the vessel.

'In the vast majority of instances, officers will take no more than a few minutes to satisfy themselves as to whether a vessel presents a risk to the border.'
