A new teacher in Wagoner, Oklahoma, was arrested on her first day after she showed up at the school both drunk and without pants.

School officials called Wagoner police around 9 a.m. on Monday morning to report that Lorie Ann Hill, 49, smelled of alcohol and was also missing the lower half of her clothing.

She was discovered slumped over the desk by two teachers in an empty classroom she was claiming was her own, Fox 23 reports.

Bad teacher: School officials called Wagoner police around 9 a.m. on Monday morning to report that Lorie Ann Hill, 49, pictured, smelled of alcohol and was also missing the lower half of her clothing

By the time police arrived, she was in the principal's office, and someone had managed to find a pair of shorts for her to wear.

'She was found in a room kind of disoriented,' Police Chief Bob Haley told the Tulsa World. 'By the time we got there she was in a room and wearing shorts.'

Hill was interviewed by police and admitted she'd been drinking.

A search of her car turned up an empty cup that reportedly smelled of vodka. 

Haley said, however, that there wasn't 
enough evidence to prove she drove to the school drunk, and no 'credible
 witnesses' at her home.

She therefore escaped a DUI charge but was booked into Wagoner City Jail on suspicion of public intoxication. She was released Tuesday evening.

Haley said Hill was recently hired by the school district, where classes start Thursday.

She was reporting for her first day on the job as other teachers were returning from summer break.

'They didn't know who she was, she was apparently new and was supposed to start yesterday,' Haley told Fox 23.

Parents were outraged by the teacher's behavior.

Frank Sandiford said: 'I don’t know, as an adult, I just don't know how you can be a professional teacher and teaching young people, and then show up drunk.'
