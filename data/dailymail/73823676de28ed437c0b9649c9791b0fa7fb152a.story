It takes more than a cumbersome leg brace to stop the heiress apparent to the Swedish throne from carrying out her duties.

Crown Princess Victoria, 36, presented the prestigious Tobias Prize at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Wednesday despite a leg brace weighing her down.

It was fitted after she sprained her ankle while skiing in Italy.

The Tobias Foundation established the Tobias Prize in 2008.

Its main aim is to give the recipient the means to carry out high-class research concerning problems of importance for cell therapy in hematological (blood-related) disorders.

It consists of a personal prize of SEK 100,000 (Â£9,500) and a research grant of SEK two million (Â£190,000) per annum for five years.

Princess Victoria sprained her ankle in the Italian Alpine resort of Cervinia on Monday December 30.

She was holidaying there with family members including her husband, Prince Daniel and their toddler daughter Estelle when the incident occurred.

She was taken by private helicopter to a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, where doctors X-rayed her foot to assess the damage.

'The crown princess suffered a sprain in the foot but is feeling otherwise well,' the royal palace said in a brief statement afterwards.

A spokeswoman at the time insisted that the injury would not affect Victoria's public commitments in the New Year â€“ and she was right.

On New Year's Eve she was seen back on the snow walking around with the aid of the leg brace and crutches.
