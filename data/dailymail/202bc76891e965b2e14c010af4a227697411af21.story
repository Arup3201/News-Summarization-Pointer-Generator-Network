Lois Arlene Janish, has been arrested and charged with open murder

A 74-year-old woman has been charged with the murder of her teenage granddaughter who went missing 15 years ago.

Coral Hall was 14 years old when she disappeared on September 22 1998.

Her grandmother, Lois Arlene Janish, has been arrested and charged with open murder, and is in custody at Genesee County Jail.

Police would not confirm the details 
of their evidence, but said that she had always been a suspect in the 
teen’s disappearance, reported WNEM 

Hall had allegedly arranged to meet with a friend, but never showed up to the pre-arranged location.

Another
 friend said that Hall had phoned her asking to stay at her house as 
Hall and her grandmother had been fighting. But she never arrived.

She had been living with her grandmother and her grandmother’s boyfriend in Flint, Michigan at the time of her disappearance.

Janish’s boyfriend has since died, but Hall has never been seen and a body never found.

A cold case investigation was led by Detective Sergeant Gregory Hosmer.

K Live reported that Sgt. Greg Hosmer
 said: 'All of (the grandmother’s) statements over the years have been 
inconsistent. Trying to sort them out just didn’t make any sense. We 
just followed up on all of that.'

Prosecutor
 David Leyton told WNEM: ‘I believe we have probable cause and at this 
time I think it is time to go forward and see if we can make this case.'

Prosecutor Leyton said that Hosmer ‘never gives up, he keeps working on this case.’
