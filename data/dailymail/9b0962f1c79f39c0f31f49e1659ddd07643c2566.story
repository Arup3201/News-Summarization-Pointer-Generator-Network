The son of famed Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy accused of stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend had an unbelievably long history of violence against women that began when he was just 17.

Documents show a trail of five terrorized girlfriends who Jared Remy, now 35, allegedly brutalized or threatened to kill beginning in the late 1990s and continuing steadily until his arrest for murder on August 15.

Despite the endless accusations, constant threats and visible wounds sported by girlfriends and friends who crossed him, Boston-area judges only found the beloved baseball announcer's son guilty twice out of 18 total charges since 1998.

Trail of terror: Jared Remy had already left behind a trail of terrorized women by the time police arrived to his Massachusetts home to find him covered in the blood of his girlfriend, who was stabbed to death by his side back in August

And the punishment those two times? Suspended sentences and nothing more.

The Boston Globe dug deep into Remy's past and found nearly 20 years worth of glaring warning signs that the hulking admitted steroid abuser was capable of uncontrolled violence.

But those warnings went unheeded. And, as the Globe writes, Remy became 'the king of second chances.'

'This is an old story for the American judicial system. You get a high-priced attorney, you get better justice,' former Lowell, Massachusetts prosecutor Joshua Friedman, who once tried and failed to  convince a jodge to give Remy a real punishment.

'If he had been Jared Smith from a well-off family, he may have gotten the same result.'

While the story may be old, Remy's tale is far from typical.

Not
 only had he faced 18 criminal charges over the years by the time he 
entered his not guilty plea to ruthlessly stabbing 27-year-old Jennifer 
Martel, the mother of his daughter, but 10 of those times he walked free
 despite being on probation or having pending charges.

The Globe notes that Remy's allegedly abhorrent treatment of the females in his life first became noticeable in 1996.

Just
 after his son was asked to leave a special school for youths with 
aggression problems, Jerry Remy asked Weston police to speak with Jared,
 who was allegedly harassed and 'pushed' a girl he'd recently broken up 
with.

History of violence: The admitted steroid abuser collected nearly twenty criminal charges dating back to the late 1990s, but his violent history did not stop Boston-area judges from continually offering the son of a beloved Red Sox personality probation and continuances instead of harsher punishments

Unbelievable: Remy was in and out of the court system but was only ever given two guilty verdicts

Famous father: Remy's father is famed Red Sox broadcaster and former Big Leaguer Jerry Remy

It was the first of long list of progressively more serious accusations against the sportscaster scion.

Remy's next girlfriend was Tiffany Guyette. She was three years his junior when they began dating.

She would give birth to their baby at 16, when Jared was 19.

The following year, in 1998, Remy would be charged with choking and hitting Guyette in his parents driveway while she held their baby.

With the help of his attorney Peter Bella, Jared would get what is called a 'continuance without a finding,' or CWOF, which means Jared could be sentenced without the court actually ruling against him.

He received one year of probation and was told he must get counseling. It was the first of a stunning six CWOFs that judges would hand Jared, largely for assaulting or threatening women.

Jared Remy's wealthy parents paid for him to get some of the best legal representation  money could buy...and he needed it.

The 35-year-old's run-ins with the law began in the mid 1990s and before the new millennium had already been accused of threatening his girlfriends.

Six of Jared's criminal charges ended with a 'continuance without a finding' or CWOF.

A CWOF allowed the judges to give Jared probation without actually determining his innocence or guilt.

Jared was on probation after CWOF rulings, or had pending charges, at the time of 10 of his arrests

The first of these alleged incidents occurred in 1996, when a concerned Jerry Remy called police to speak with his son who he believed had threatened and pushed an ex-girlfriend at just 17.

Jared's next girlfriend also became the mother of this baby. Tiffany Guyette was just 16 when she gave birth.

Son after, Jared was accused of beating and choking her as she held their infant child.

Later, he was accused of smashing a bottle of his friend's head for hanging out with Guyette.

Lysa Gianacopolis accused Jared of threatening to kill her and of slashing her friend's car tires after the two of them broke up.

Jared's girlfriend Ryan McMahon got a restraining order against Jared, who she said bloodied her nose and threatened her life, among other appalling acts.

Jared racked up about 20 criminal charges before he finally was found covered in Jennifer Martell's blood last summer.

Of those charges, he was found guilty just two times.

Tragic: Martell accused Remy of threatening and abusing her in August 2013. She filed for a protective order, but didn't show up to court to have the emergency order extended. Remy was allowed to go free August 13, 2013. Two days later, Martell would be dead

Before his probation was up, Jared was charged with smashing a beer bottle over his friend's head, reportedly because the friend was involved with his now-ex girlfriend Guyette.

He would receive another CWOF and an extended probation for that charge.

Remy's next girlfriend Lysa Gianacopolis would also accuse him of threatening her, but after she failed to testify against him, the charges eventually faded away.

In May of 2000, Remy got two more CWOFs: One for possession of hypodermic needles and another related to an incident in which he was reportedly causing a scene in his driveway as he screamed at his mother and then elbowed a responding police officer.

The next girlfriend to allege that Remy beat her was Ryan McMahon.

Most notable among his more dubious 
interactions with McMahon was a 2003 incident in which Remy was booked 
and then bailed out on charges he was terrorizing her and then allegedly
 called to threaten McMahon twenty minutes after his arrest from front 
right in front of the police station.

Nearly
 eight years went by before Martel was again charged with a violent 
crime, an August 13, 2013 assault charge police filed on behalf of 
Jennifer Martel.

She was dead two days later.

'No parents are immune from trouble with their children,' said Jerry Remy. 'My wife and I did everything we could to provide Jared with the necessary professional help'

In court, prosecutors described a brutal and determined attack, saying Remy assaulted Martel in the kitchen, living room, on a stairway and then pinned her to the ground in the patio where he stabbed her several times. Neighbors who tried to help Martel were driven back when Remy slashed at them, Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern told a judge.

Remy was arrested at the scene, his clothes soaked in the victim's blood.

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend.

'She said, "I was planning my escape,"' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on Wednesday. She said, "Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape."'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing.

Jared Remy's murder trial has been scheduled for October this year.

He's pleaded not guilty and thus far has maintained that he's innocent of killing Martel.

Horrific: Martel was in the midst of her escape from life with Remy when he allegedly surprised her in their home and stabbed her to death, leaving a trail of blood throughout the house

Witnesses: A neighbor at the couple's Waltham townhouse says he tried pulling Remy off of Martell, but it was no use. She was dead by the time help arrived
