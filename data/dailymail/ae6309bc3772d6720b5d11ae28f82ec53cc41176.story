An 11-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet is among the two dead and nearly two dozen other people wounded by yet another brutal night of gun violence in Chicago.

Shamiya Adams was making s'mores inside a South Side home for a sleepover Friday night when a bullet went into the house and struck her in the head. A 30-year-old man was also shot dead, police said.

An additional 20 people were injured across the city. As usual, the bulk of the violence occurred on the South and West Sides – a refrain that is now playing out on a nightly basis.

‘They were just running around through the house, dancing. That's all they do is dance all the time. And dancing, dancing, dancing,’ homeowner Rosemarie Jones told WLS.

Until a bullet came through the wall and struck Adams in the head, according to police, she was rushed to a nearby hospital and died Saturday morning.

‘The familiarity of laughter has been replaced by the familiarity of gunfire,’ Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a Saturday morning press briefing.

The innocent girl was making s'mores with her friends when the bullet struck her, according to the Chicago Tribune. Her young friends saw the bullet strike her head.

Hours after the girl was rushed to a hospital and as police still searched for her killer without any solid leads, marshmallows and chocolate bars were still scattered over the bed Adams and friends were on, according to the paper.

Spattered traces of the 11-year-old girl's blood were observed just under a stuffed Tweety Bird doll hanging on the wall. Adams was enjoying her summer vacation with her friends like any other girl her age.

'They were just doing their girlie things,' a resident of the house who was not home at the time of the shooting told the paper. 'They heard shots and a bullet came through the window.'

The children were likely inside because of how dangerous the city's West Side, where the home is, becomes on summer nights.

Adams’ mother was protective of her to 
the point the young girl was rarely allowed to go out, those who knew 
her say. It was the 11-year-old’s first sleepover.

‘She
 don't let Shamiya go much unless she go to family and then the first 
time you let her go something like this happens? This is really eating 
her up,’ Nanette Dailey told the station.

‘I
 got nothing left to say to these moms,’ Emanuel continued. ‘I don't 
know where they find the strength to go on, put one foot in front of 
another. Because she had the... she wanted her daughter to play with her
 friends. We're a better city than that.’

But statistics paint a different picture.

Despite city officials infamously claiming “crime is down” earlier this year, murders are on pace to at least equal last year’s total.

There have so far this year been 223 shooting deaths this year, according to an independent website that tracks crime and mayhem in Chicago.

There were 454 shooting deaths in Chicago in 2013.

The 223rd person shot to death this year in the city was an unidentified 30-year-old man found in a car parked in an alley at 10.00 p.m. by police – only half an hour after Adams was shot.

He had multiple gunshot wounds to his neck, back and shoulder, according to the Chicago Tribune, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Among the injured were four men who showed up with unexplained gunshot wounds at a West Side hospital, authorities said.

Two 15-year-old boys were shot in unrelated incidents. One suffered only a wound to his leg, the Tribune reported. The other told doctors he was on a sidewalk when someone walked up and shot him in the arm and foot.

A 26-year-old was shot after arguing with a male in a car parked on the same street corner where he was standing, cops said. The male got out of the car, opened fire and fled.

No arrests have been made in any of the shootings.
