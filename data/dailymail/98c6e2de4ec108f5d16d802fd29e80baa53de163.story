George Osborne yesterday handed the Bank of England sweeping new powers to kick-start the economy – following talks with its new Canadian governor.

In a shake-up of monetary policy, the Chancellor said the central bank should focus on boosting jobs and growth and not just controlling inflation.

But the change of direction has fuelled fears Britain faces a prolonged period of record low interest rates and above-target inflation in a crushing blow to savers and pensioners. Campaigners accused the Chancellor of ‘a disgraceful betrayal of Britain’s savers’.

New powers: Chancellor George Osborne's Budget statement outlined plans to hand new powers to the Bank of England to kick-start the economy

The move, outlined in the Budget, has been signed off by Mark Carney, who takes over as governor from Sir Mervyn King in July.

It is hoped his arrival will herald a new  pro-growth era at the Bank following two decades of relentlessly targeting inflation.

The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 and pumped billions of emergency cash into the economy through quantitative easing in a desperate bid to stimulate growth.

But Britain remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century.

Mr Osborne said the Bank will still have a 2 per cent inflation target – but added it was no longer enough to spur the economy. ‘As we have seen over the last five years, low and stable inflation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for prosperity,’ he said.

The Chancellor said the new remit gives the rate-setting monetary policy committee greater flexibility to support the economy rather than just target inflation.

It paves the way for the Bank to let inflation remain above the 2 per cent target for some time if the economy is not strong enough to withstand interest rate rises.

He also said the Bank ‘may wish’ to follow the route taken in the US where the Federal Reserve issues ‘guidance’ on the future path of interest rates.

He added: ‘This can help the economy because it gives families planning their futures, and businesses wondering whether to invest, more confidence that interest rates will stay lower for longer.’

Mr Osborne said the Bank will provide a report on how this might work in August.Richard Barwell, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said explicit promises to keep rates low risked stoking inflation.

He added: ‘My concern is the man on the street will believe an unconditional promise has been made to keep rates low and the small print – that everything depends on inflation remaining under control – will get lost in the translation.’

Simon Rose, of campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘The Chancellor has thrown savers to the wolves. The Chancellor’s announcement will lead to even lower savings rates and still higher inflation, with appalling effects for those relying on savings income.’

Challenge: When new Bank of England governor Mark Carney walks into the inner sanctum of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street in July, he will face a colossal task

Now we know why the Chancellor felt 
it was worth making Mark Carney, the incoming Governor of the Bank of 
England, the highest-paid head of a central bank anywhere in the Western
world.

When the 48-year-old Canadian marches 
past the pink-clad doormen into the inner sanctum of the Old Lady of 
Threadneedle Street in July, he will face a colossal task.

Carney is being asked by the 
government to do for Britain what his counterpart at the Federal Reserve
Board in Washington, Ben Bernanke, has done for America. In the U.S., 
unemployment has been brought down and growth rekindled.

In the face of enormous problems in 
the public finances in Britain, Carney is being asked to kick-start the 
economy and free our government from the perils of slump and debt.

To assist him, the Bank is being given
the power to use what the Chancellor yesterday called ‘unconventional 
monetary instruments’ to conduct the biggest monetary experiment of 
modern times.

The new Governor will have carte 
blanche to keep interest rates low and to print money — a process known 
as ‘quantitative easing’ — for as long as it takes, until such time as 
the British economy has spluttered fully back to life. In theory, the 
more money in circulation, the more cash there is for businesses to 
invest and consumers to spend.

Yet there is an enormous risk that 
this strategy of flooding the country with billions in newly printed 
money could provoke a full-blown sterling crisis. This happens when 
international investors and speculators lose faith in the pound and sell
it on the foreign exchange markets, leading to an uncontrolled fall in 
the value of sterling.

The other danger is that the flood of 
money into the economy could lead to higher prices, which in turn might 
unleash a surge in inflation far in excess of that already squeezing 
British households.
Speculation that the UK is about to 
embark on a grand monetary experiment has already knocked the pound down
by 8 per cent against the dollar and 7 per cent against the euro (at 
least until this week’s Cyprus crisis) since the start of the year.

Carte Blanche: As the new Bank of England governor, Carney is being asked to do for Britain what his counterpart at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington has done for the U.S.

The scale and speed of the fall in 
sterling provides a sharp reminder of how the best-laid government plans
can be blown out of the water if financial markets start to believe 
that the currency is being weakened.

In preparing his Budget, George 
Osborne found himself with very little room for manoeuvre. His 
underlying strategy of placing the public sector on short rations to 
stimulate recovery has so far not worked as well as he had hoped.

A combination of factors, including 
the worsening crisis in the eurozone and the tighter regulation of banks
— which has made it harder for them to lend to business and households —
has meant a longer and more sustained period of downturn than anyone 
envisaged.

Indeed, irony of ironies, the 
independent Office for Budget Responsibility — Osborne’s own creation — 
has delivered him another crushing blow by halving the growth forecast 
for this year from 1.2 per cent (the figure it came up with as recently 
as the autumn statement in December) to just 0.6 per cent.

That means Britain’s debt burden — the
accumulation of years of feckless New Labour borrowing — will not start
to fall until 2017-18, a year later than previously promised.

By definition a ‘neutral’ Budget — 
which does not place any more cash in people’s pockets — of the kind 
Osborne delivered yesterday cannot by itself deliver economic expansion.

This’s why Carney is being asked to 
pick up the ball and run with it at the Bank of England. The Chancellor 
may have reiterated his commitment to holding inflation at 2 per cent, 
but he is also asking the Bank to do far more than it already is.

Downturn: In preparing his Budget, Mr Osborne found himself with very little room for manoeuvre

He is setting the Bank’s Monetary 
Policy Committee the awesome task of pitching interest rates for set 
periods of time at levels that will encourage higher growth and lower 
unemployment, while pegging back inflation.

This is precisely what has been done 
in the U.S., where the central bank has promised to keep interest rates 
at low levels and persist with radical policies such as printing more 
dollars until normality has returned to the financial system in the wake
of the 2008 meltdown.

It is not yet clear what 
‘unconventional’ methods Carney will use. But there are plenty of hints 
buried in the Budget documents. Among those listed are further rounds of
printing money beyond the £375 billion already undertaken.

Another strong possibility is to 
supercharge the ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme, which has rekindled the 
housing market by using the Government’s ability to borrow more cheaply 
to lower the cost of mortgages and business loans.

Carney might also consider the use of 
official ‘negative interest’ rates, which means that banks are required 
to pay an interest rate penalty for keeping their cash reserves safe at 
the Bank of England. (At present they prefer to keep them in this safe 
haven rather than lend to other banks that are less stable.)

By thus charging a fee to the banks for not lending out their excess cash, Carney would hope to force them to lend more.

One big downside of printing more 
money and keeping interest rates low is that, yet again, savers with 
money on deposit will see their returns savaged, and the hard-won 
rewards of thrift undermined.

Yet Osborne, Carney and the Government
will see this as a price worth paying if the avalanche of new cash can 
resuscitate an economy operating well below its capacity.

In his native Canada, Carney — the 
central banker with the George Clooney looks — is lauded for having 
steered one of the world’s richest countries successfully through the 
great recession of recent years.

In Britain he faces a much tougher 
task in the shape of an unwieldy financial sector and a eurozone trading
partner going through its own banking and monetary crisis.

Admittedly, the UK economy he inherits
is not in quite such bad shape as the Opposition parties and much of 
the media would have you believe. It is growing, if only just, and the 
capacity to create new private sector jobs — more than 470,000 in the 
past year alone — is remarkable.

If the Bank of England can lubricate 
the machine sufficiently to boost expansion prospects, Carney could be 
remembered as the monetary wizard who defied the odds  and saved George 
Osborne’s bacon.

But if the eurozone implodes, 
inflation takes off and interest rates are forced higher, then the 
consequences could be dramatic, with house prices falling and ordinary 
families left with huge mortgage debts they can’t repay. That is 
George’s gamble.
