The British 'stiff upper lip' and a fear of wasting a doctor's time mean nearly half of the over-50s ignore symptoms of cancer.

Further reasons for not seeking help were fearing the worst, dismissing warning signs and lacking confidence in the country's healthcare system.

The Cancer Research UK study was published ahead of an NHS campaign warning people to tell their doctor about trivial complaints – such as a persistent cough or heart burn – that could indicate cancer.  

Other tell-tale signs include an unexplained lump, a persistent change in bowel or bladder habits, unexplained weight loss, constant difficulty swallowing and a change in the appearance of a mole.

The study, of more than 1,700 people aged 50 and over, looked at how those who experience possible cancer symptoms decide whether or not to seek medical help.

Many dismissed their symptoms as 'normal for them' while others reported them to their GP only in passing, or preferred to go to A&E.

Cancer Research UK said many symptoms may not be a cause of cancer but, if they are, early diagnosis increases survival chances. The survey found that more than 900 people reported having at least one symptom of cancer in the previous three months.

One woman explained away her persistent abdominal pain by saying: 'At times I thought it was bad...but then it kind of fades away and it doesn't seem worth pursuing.'

A man with a change in bladder habits said: 'You've just got to get on with it. And if you go to the doctor too much, it's seen as a sign of weakness or that you are not strong enough to manage things on your own.'

Katriina Whitaker, a senior cancer research fellow at University College London, said: 'Many of the people we interviewed had red flag symptoms but felt that these were trivial and didn't need medical attention, particularly if they were painless or intermittent.

'Others felt that they shouldn't make a fuss or waste valuable NHS resources. The stiff-upper-lip stoicism of some who decided not to go to their doctor was alarming because they put up with often debilitating symptoms.

'Some people made the decision to get symptoms checked out after seeing a cancer awareness campaign or being encouraged to do so by family or friends – this seemed to almost legitimise their symptoms as important.'

The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice.
