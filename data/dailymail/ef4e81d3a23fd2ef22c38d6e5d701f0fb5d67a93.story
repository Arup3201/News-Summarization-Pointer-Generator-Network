Once upon a time, the Borscht Belt beat with life.

Resorts dotting the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York were filled with families spending their summer days swimming in pools, and their nights dancing in clubs or watching stand-up from soon-to-be-famous comedians. The holiday destinations were immortalized in the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, which was set in fictional Catskills resort, Kellerman's.

But that Borscht Belt no longer exists. As captured in these photographs by Marisa Scheinfeld, the only thing that now thrives in the area is the moss that is unrecognizable from the carpets, the trees that have cracked through the swimming pools.

The upstate New York holiday destinations were immortalized in 1987 movie Dirty Dancing, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, which was set in fictional Catskills resort, Kellerman's. Guests were portrayed enjoying dance lessons and light musical entertainment in the evening

Scheinfeld, 33, grew up in the Borscht Belt, nicknamed because it was a popular vacation spot for New York City Jews for more than fifty years. It was also sometimes called the Jewish Alps. 

According to Scheinfeld, Jews were banned from most hotels in the United States in the early 1920s. The region first began developing as farmers turned their extra space into boarding houses. 

It was in the 1950s that the Borscht Belt, which included the counties of Sullivan, Orange and Ulster, really boomed, she told the Brian Lehrer Show. 

There were more than 500 hotels in Sullivan county at the height of the region's popularity, and 1,000 additional summer bungalows.

The Grossinger Country Club in 1954 was bustling with sunbathers and even had its own lap pool

The Concord, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous hotels, had 40 tennis courts, three golf courses, 1,200 guest rooms and a dining room that could fit up to 3,000 people, according to Newsweek. 

It even had its own gas station. Muhammad Ali trained for fights at the hotel. 

But when Scheinfeld revisited it, the Concord was a corpse of its former self. It had been demolished and used as a fireman training camp. Now she said it's just a 'pile of rubble, deformed and rusting with times and seasons and change'. 

Scheinfeld began her photography project in 2009, inspired by a bout of homesickness after she had moved to the West Coast.

A phone still remains in a guest room at the Tamarack Lodge. According to Scheinfeld, the Borscht Belt started losing popularity due to multiple things, including the boom of the airline industry in the 1970s

The photographer yearned to revisit her childhood home and reconnect with herself, she told the New York Times. 

She wanted to see the halls where she used to play with her grandparents and the pool where she learned how to swim in.

Scheinfeld said she saw the havoc of human and nature. Of graffiti and buildings gutted for wires, of once glamorous rooms overwrought with moss.

But she said she didn't want to make the entire project 'about decay'. 

'I see beauty and growth in the pictures as well,' she told the New York Times. 

'There's something still there, even if people think it's washed away.' 

But the region might have a chance at new life after all. Three casinos were recently approved as part of a $1.1billion resort project in the region.
