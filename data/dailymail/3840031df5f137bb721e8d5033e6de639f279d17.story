With her glossy blonde hair, demure smile and outgoing personality, Lady Kitty Spencer
 bears more than a passing resemblance to her late aunt, Princess Diana.

And last night Earl Spencer's daughter Lady Kitty followed in her relative's charitable footsteps by supporting a high-profile event in London in aid of servicemen back from war zones.

Dressed in an eye-catching floor-length cream and gold gown, Lady Kitty met with soldiers from 11 EOD regiment after their tour in Afghanistan at the Give Us Time event.

With a glowing tan and bouncy blonde curls, Lady Kitty seemed to enjoy her evening as she mingled with fellow guests and servicemen.

The 22-year-old, who boasts a lineage dating from pre-Tudor 
times and a family fortune of more than £100million, was named the 
most eligible girl in Britain by Tatler magazine in 2007.

Kitty grew up away from the media spotlight in South Africa with her mother 
Victoria Lockwood, the former model who was Earl Spencer's first wife.

She quickly caught the media's attention when she made one of her first public appearances in 2007, alongside her cousins Prince William and Prince Harry at a memorial service for Diana.

She also attended William and Kate's wedding in 2011 but her parents have deliberately tried to keep her out of the media spotlight.

Rarely seen out on the party scene, Kitty was a straight-A 
student at Reddam House, a private school for South Africa's elite.

She then went on to study psychology, politics and English literature at the University of Cape Town.

It was widely reported in April this year that she was dating England cricket star, Nick Compton.

Asked at the time whether her son was ‘keen on 
Kitty’, Mrs Compton said with the kind of toe-curling candour only a 
mother can: ‘Of course he is keen on her! He hasn’t had many girlfriends
 because he’s always been really focussed on his cricket and hasn’t had 
time for relationships. But he is still with Kitty… ‘

The pair have not been seen together for some months, and it is not known whether they are still dating.

Public: The pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at Lord's earlier in the year

Royal cousins: Lady Kitty Spencer is a first cousin of the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry
