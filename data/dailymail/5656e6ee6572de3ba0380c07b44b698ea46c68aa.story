Ever thought that giving up your favourite sweet treat was almost impossible?

Scientists at the University of New South Wales have found that feeding rats a junk food diet made it harder for the rats to return to a healthy diet.

This study could explain why it's harder for overweight people to avoid high calorie foods.

Junk food could actually be changing your brain's ability to eat healthy food

The study published in Frontiers in Psychology led by Professor Margaret Morrie helps explain how excessive consumption of junk food can change behavior, weaken self-control and lead to overeating and obesity.The team of researchers taught young male rats to associate two different sound cues with a two particular flavours of sugar water.

Healthy rats, raised on a healthy diet, stopped responding to cues linked to a flavour they had recently overindulged in.

This instinctive mechanism in animals protects against overeating and promotes a healthy, balanced diet.

The key to why junk food is so addictive may have been found

After two weeks on a diet that included pies, dumplings, cookies and cake – with 150 per cent more calories – the rats’ weight increased by 10 per cent and their behaviour changed dramatically.

They became indifferent in their food choices and no longer avoided the sound advertising the over familiar taste, indicating they had lost their natural preference for novelty.

The change lasted for some time after the rats returned to a healthy diet.

'We think that a junk diet causes lasting changes in the reward circuit parts of the rats’ brains in the area responsible for decision-making,' said Professor Morris.

'Because the brain’s reward circuitry is similar in all mammals, this could have implications for people’s ability to limit their intake of certain kinds of foods.'

'If the same thing happens in humans, eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards. It’s like you’ve just had ice cream for lunch, yet you still go and eat more when you hear the ice cream van comes by,' she explained.

Dr Amy Reichelt from the School of Psychology in UNSW Science says:'As the global obesity epidemic intensifies, advertisements may have a greater effect on people who are overweight and make purchases of snacks like chocolate bars harder to resist.'

Ultimately the study shows that if the human brain works like the rats brain, junk food is almost an addiction that our bodies are not able to resist.

The study performed on rats shows that junk food not only makes rats fat, it also stops them from seeking out a balanced diet
