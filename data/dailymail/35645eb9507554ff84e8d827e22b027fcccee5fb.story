Oldham will not offer convicted rapist Ched Evans a return to football, the club confirmed on Monday.  

The 25-year-old was released from prison in October after serving just half of his sentence for the rape of a teenage girl. 

The former Sheffield United striker had looked set to re-sign for the Blades but they bowed to intense public pressure not to allow him back.

League One Oldham had spoken to Evans about joining Lee Johnson’s side but a source said: ‘It is 99.9 per cent not going to happen.'

And on Monday, Oldham released a statement confirming no offer would be made to Evans. 

'Oldham Athletic are aware of various newspaper reports linking the club to Ched Evans yesterday,' the statement said. 'The Board of Directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for Ched Evans to train with Oldham Athletic nor will we be offering him a contract. The club will not be making any further comment on this subject.'

Evans had initially been allowed to train with his former side Sheffield United, but after several sponsors and patrons either stepped down or threatened to, the club retracted their offer.
