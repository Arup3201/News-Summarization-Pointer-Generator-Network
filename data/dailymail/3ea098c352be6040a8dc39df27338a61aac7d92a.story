Popular: Chinese wine is now being stocked by Britain's oldest wine merchant Berry Bros & Rudd. There are tens of millions of wine lovers in China

It has supplied fine wines and other vintage beverages to the Royal Family since the reign of King George III.

But now Britain's oldest wine merchant is focusing on the future by stocking claret from China - reflecting the astonishing growth of the country's wine industry.

Berry Bros & Rudd - which has been based in St James', London, since 1698 - now sells four kinds of Chinese wine.

The firm has tapped into the growing taste for wine in Asia, and now has offices in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Its decision to stock Chinese wine is a major boon for the country's winemakers as Berry Bros & Rudd has supplied the Royal Family since the 1700s.

The Chinese wines the firm stocks are sourced from European grapes and were bought from Château Changyu - the world's tenth largest winery, The Times reports.

The drink is increasingly popular with China's expanding middles classes, with more than 1.6 billion bottles already consumed in the country each year.

Perhaps unsurprisingly China is on course to becoming the World's largest consumer of wine - and is the eighth largest producer.

One of the four wines stocked by Berry Bros is a red from Changyu, while the other three are sweet, 'ice wines' made from frozen grapes, according to The Times.

They include a 2008 Chateau Changyu Moser priced at £39.

Wine production in China is aided by the similarity in climate in parts of the nation to key wine growing regions in Europe.

Concerns have been raised over the amount of 'fake' European or New World wines that are available on the black market.

However, the best Chinese wine is now competing with vintage from more established nations in Europe and the New World and could become a common sight on British supermarket shelves.

Wine production in China dates back thousands of years, with Xinjiang and Ningxia the two key regions.

However, the modern wine industry in 
Xinjiang is not connected to the country's traditional wine making culture. Many of the 
wineries are instead based on French methods.

Ningxia province is also noted for its high quality wines, with some winning prestigious industry awards for quality.
