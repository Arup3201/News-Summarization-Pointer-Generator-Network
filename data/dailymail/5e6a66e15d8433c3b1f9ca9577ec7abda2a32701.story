Ronnie Moore could be set for a return to management with the Football League’s bottom club Hartlepool United, eight months after he was sacked by Tranmere Rovers for a breach of betting rules.

The 61-year-old was fired in April after he admitted an FA charge relating to betting on competitions and matches in which his club was involved.

Moore broke the rules after placing bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere to win in a double with Manchester United, which returned £3.93.

Following his dismissal, Moore said: ‘The only thing I’m guilty of really is I’m embarrassed because as a manager of Tranmere Rovers I should have known (the rules) – so I hold my hands up, it was my fault.’

Speaking at the time, his solicitor, Steve Smith, added: ‘The prosecution accepted there were no integrity issues against him.’

Moore was fined £2,000 and given a one-month suspension, suspended for two years.

And now Sportsmail understands he is in the running to replace Paul Murray at Victoria Park.

The final straw for Hartlepool's hierarchy came when the side lost to non-League Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup

Moore – who came close to landing the Carlisle job before Keith Curle was appointed in September - faces competition from former Scunthorpe boss Brian Laws and ex-Middlesbrough assistant Mark Venus, although Pools are keen to install an experienced manager and the Scouser fits the bill.

They are six points from safety at the bottom of League Two and have not won in the league for two months.

Murray’s reign lasted just seven matches, during which time Pools won once – 2-0 against East Thurrock in the FA Cup First Round – but were beaten 2-1 by non-league Blyth Spartans in the Second Round last weekend. That result led to Murray and assistant Willie Donachie being sacked.

Sportsmail understands Murray had even offered to help contribute towards the cost of bringing in new players in a bid to spark a turnaround.
