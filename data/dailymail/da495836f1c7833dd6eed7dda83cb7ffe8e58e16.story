In the Premier League, Manchester United supporters saw the highest number of arrests - 112 - in the 2013/14 season. This compares to 71 at Manchester City and 67 at Arsenal.

At the other end of the table sit Norwich, who were relegated to the Championship, with just four arrests, while Swansea were 19th with nine arrests and Southampton 18th with 14.

The number of arrests made for racist and indecent chants has fallen my a massive 76 per sent since 2000, with just 21 people detained last season. 

A Football League spokesperson, said: 'The Football League and our clubs work closely with the police and local authorities to ensure that our grounds are safe places for people to watch and enjoy football. 

'Every season clubs spend over £10 million on security arrangements to keep supporters safe and a further £6million on police services where they are required, although more than half of Football League matches are now police free.

'It's hugely encouraging that arrests at football matches are at a record low and the large fall in incidents over the last decade demonstrates that the approach being taken to crowd management at our clubs is the correct one.'
