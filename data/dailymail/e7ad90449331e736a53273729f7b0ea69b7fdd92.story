Snub: Several Muslim leaders turned down an invitation by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his comments over NYPD policing practices

Several Muslim leaders have refused invitations to the New York Mayor's interfaith breakfast over 'disturbing' claims police are spying on and infiltrating mosques.

The unnamed imams and activists said in a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg they're disturbed by New York Police Department's intelligence-gathering programs which monitored Muslim groups, businesses and houses of worship.

Reports recently revealed
16 police officers speaking at least five languages were assigned to use 
census information and government databases to map ethnic neighbourhoods
in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Undercover 
police officers known as ‘rakers’ visited local businesses such as 
Islamic bookstores and cafes, chatting up store owners to determine 
their ethnicities and gauge their views.

They played cricket and eavesdropped in ethnic cafes and clubs.

But Mayor Bloomberg has defended the NYPD, saying it doesn't take religion into account in its policing.

His spokesman Stu Loeser added although a several people turned down the breakfast invitation, a couple of dozen said they plan to attend.

In an open letter to Mayor Bloomberg the Muslim leaders said they believe NYPD police measures ‘threaten the rights of all Americans, and deepen mistrust between our communities and law enforcement.’

'Mayor Bloomberg, the extent of these civil rights violations is astonishing, yet instead of calling for accountability and the rule of law, you have thus far defended the NYPD's misconduct,' the letter said.

The Muslim leaders said they although they appreciate the mayor's support a year ago during an uproar over a planned Islamic center near the World Trade Center site they are disappointed by reports police were infiltrating Muslim neighbourhoods.

The leaders claim aggressive programs designed by a CIA officer who worked with the department after the September 11 attacks are unnecessary and troubling.

The CIA is prohibited from spying domestically. Its unusual partnership with the NYPD has troubled top lawmakers and prompted an internal investigation.

Mayor Bloomberg in October defended the arrangement, saying it was necessary in a dangerous world.

'There are people trying to kill us,' he said. 'And if the CIA can help us I'm all for getting any information they have and then letting the police department use it as - if it's appropriate to protect you and to protect me.'

The letter noted that Muslims comprise at least 10 per cent of the city's population. It said the Muslims leaders were seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss the issues raised by the reports.

It read: "We are deeply disturbed that to date we have only heard your words of strong support for these troubling policies and violations of our rights.

'We are equally disturbed by (Police Commissioner Raymond) Kelly's denials of what we know to be true as verified by the leaked documents.'
