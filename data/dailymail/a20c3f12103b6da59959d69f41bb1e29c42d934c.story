If you go shopping for NBA jerseys, Louis Vuitton handbags or Ugg boots today then be rest assured there’s less chance of you being sold a fake.

Around 150 websites accused of selling knock-off or pirated goods to unsuspecting online bargain hunters have been shut down by authorities.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized domain names for the sites in a three-month probe.

‘This is straight crime,’ ICE Director John Morton said. ‘This is people being duped into buying a counterfeit.’

Results of the investigation were revealed on ‘Cyber Monday’ - the day for many shoppers that kicks off the online holiday shopping season.

The U.S. federal government has seized the domain names of 350 websites since first targeting online counterfeiters in June 2010.

Visitors to the seized domains are now greeted with a message from authorities saying the site has been seized by the government. It says:

'Wilful copyright infringement is a federal crime that is punishable by up to five years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine, forfeiture and full restitution.’

Did you shop more on Cyber Monday than Black Friday?

Mr Morton and Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said the domain names were registered in the U.S. but most were run abroad in China.

Nobody has yet been charged with a crime in connection with the most recently seized domains.

Earlier this year five people were indicted in Virginia on conspiracy and copyright infringement charges for their roles in operating a website.

NinjaVideo.net allowed people to illegally download high-quality movies and television shows, the Justice Department said.

Mr Breuer said since the crackdown on counterfeit sellers started last year, internet users have gone to the seized domains 77 million times.

'It is very large figures. Well, well above millions'

‘Typically we don't track the volumes of sales of these particular sites,’ Mr Morton said. ‘It is very large figures. Well, well above millions.’

He said it may seem trivial to buy knock-off sunglasses, but profits for the counterfeiters can help fund far more nefarious activities.

‘This is increasingly not simply a matter of mom and pop violations at the corner of Fourth and Main,’ Mr Morton added.
