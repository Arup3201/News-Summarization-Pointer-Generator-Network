'Killer driver': Marek Wojciechowski, 26, pictured with his wife Agnieszka, 'deliberately' crashed into an Irish family's car - killing a father, his unborn child and his son

A woman lost her husband, toddler son and unborn child when a suicidal driver ploughed head-on into their car, an inquest heard yesterday.

Elber Twomey, 36, was the only survivor of the crash caused by taxi driver Marek Wojciechowski, who had earlier written a suicide note after splitting up from his wife.

Wojciechowski died, along with Mrs Twomey’s husband Con, their 16-month-old son Oisin, and the baby she was carrying. She was 24 weeks pregnant.

After reading his suicide note, Wojciechowski’s wife alerted police, who followed him but were unable to stop him before he smashed into the family’s vehicle.

Oisin was killed immediately and Mr Twomey, who was 39, suffered serious brain injuries and died ten months later.

The crash happened on the last day of the family’s summer holiday in Devon.

An inquest into the deaths heard that Polish-born Wojciechowski, 26, had left a four-page suicide note after breaking up with his wife Agnieszka.

She alerted police who spotted his vehicle and turned on their siren and flashing lights.

But instead of stopping, witnesses say Wojciechowski sped on, veering across into the opposite carriageway and straight at the Twomeys’ car making it ‘impossible’ for the family to avoid him.

Before the crash, Wojciechowski spent 40 minutes driving his black taxi 12 two-mile circuits around the Hamelin Way loop

Witness John Onions said he still suffered flashbacks after letting the Twomeys’ VW Golf overtake him at an earlier junction.

Describing
 the collision, Mr Onions told the inquest into the deaths of Oisin and 
Wojciechowski that the Pole’s Vauxhall Vectra ‘just took off’.

He continued: ‘It just went straight across into the car in front of me.

‘It
 sounds awful now, but the crash looked deliberate. It decided to 
accelerate and go straight across the road. The image was that the 
Vectra seemed to shoot straight across.

‘It was impossible for them to do anything. The oncoming car decided to turn and go straight into it. It’s as simple as that.’

He added: ‘It dawned on me afterwards that if I hadn’t let them in, it would have been me.’

Wojciechowski was arrested at the scene and taken to hospital but died from his injuries later that day.

The
 inquest in Torquay heard how the Pole had driven up and down the same 
stretch of road for 39 minutes before finally ploughing into the 
Twomeys’ car.

CCTV 
cameras recorded him driving in a continuous two-mile loop between two 
roundabouts in Torquay before he was spotted by police.

PC
 Ben Bickford approached with his lights flashing and siren sounding in 
an attempt to get him to pull over but Wojiechowski sped on.

The
 officer told the jury he spotted a black car driving in the opposite 
carriageway and followed ‘on a hunch’ to see if it was Wojiechowski.

Split: Agnieszka Wojiechowska, the Polish taxi driver's wife, who raised the alarm and said he had left a suicide note

He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up with the Vectra and flashed his lights four times to signal the driver to pull over.

Crash victim: Oisin, aged 16 months, was killed in the accident on the last day of his family's holiday in England

PC
 Bickford said: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I
 am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence.

'As
 we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of 
accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.

‘The back end of the vehicle dipped dramatically, turning directly into an oncoming car. I was just in shock.’

Mrs Twomey asked questions through her barrister about the lack of a specific police procedure to deal with suicidal drivers.

But Chief Superintendent James Nye told the court that PC Bickford was operating within standard police procedures.

He
 added: ‘No one foresaw that outcome. It is tragic and it affected the 
whole policing community but it was in line with guidelines.’

The court heard Wojciechowski’s suicide note said he did not blame his wife for their split and that he loved their children.

He had taken a job as a taxi driver working six nights a week after the couple got into financial difficulties.

Interviewed
 by police a week after her husband’s death, Mrs Wojciechowski, a 
housekeeper, blamed herself for the accident in July 2012. 

She
 told officers: ‘Marek wasn’t coping well. He didn’t kill himself – I 
killed him. I took hope away from him. I took everything away from him.’

Anguish: Con Towmey's coffin is carried out of St Joseph's Church, in Meelin, Cork, in May. He never recovered from a brain injury sustained in the collision and died 10 months after the crash in July last year

Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May.

It is understood his wife visited his bedside on a daily basis before his death.

The inquest continues.
