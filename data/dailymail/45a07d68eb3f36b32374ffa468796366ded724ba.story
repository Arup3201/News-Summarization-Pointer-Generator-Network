The World Cup final can be the best occasion of a footballer's life, or the worst if they crumble under the pressure.

Germany and Argentina contested the climax to the 2014 tournament, with Mario Gotze scoring a stunning late winner to win it for Joachim Low's side.

Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown, the ex-England and Arsenal defender, rates all of the players involved in the match.

Crucial: Mario Gotze celebrates scoring the goal that won Germany the World Cup against Argentina

Leader: Jerome Boateng was superb in the World Cup final

Ouch: Manuel Neuer clatters into Gonzalo Higuain in the second half... he still earned his team a foul

GERMANY

MANUEL NEUER - 7

Didn’t have much to do in the first half. Dangerous challenge on Higuain. Presence helped put off Messi when through on goal.

PHILLIP LAHM - 7

Partnership with Muller good again. Intelligent and economical with his passing. Timed his tackles and interceptions perfectly.

JEROME BOATENG - 8... STAR MAN

Did well. Saw the danger early and put his body on the line. Only one with real pace in the German back line. Suited central role.

MATS HUMMELS - 6

Outpaced by Messi time and time again. Had a good tournament but struggled against the runners from deep

BENEDIKT HOWEDES - 6

Very high tackle and was maybe a tad fortunate just to get a yellow. Exposed by his side’s high line. Also missed good chance with header near end of the first half. Booked.

Great chance: Benedikt Howedes missed a fine chance to open the scoring for Germany with a header

Leader: Bastian Schweinsteiger did a fine job in stemming the flow of the Argentine attacks

BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER - 7.5

Made very important interceptions. Crucial role in stemming the Argentina runs from deep. Booked.

CHRISTOPH KRAMER - 5

Fleeting appearance. Unlucky to have that clash of heads. Did OK before that but was a huge call to pick him. Not sure I would have.

Unlucky: Cristoph Kramer had to go off after picking up a head injury in this challenge

THOMAS MULLER - 8

Boundless energy down the right-hand side but delivery needed to be better at times. Movement, as ever, was incredibly intelligent.

TONI KROOS - 7

Quite quiet but still had chances to score. Plays longer balls than the rest of their midfield and that gave Germany variety.

MESUT OZIL - 6.5

Looked up for the game, worked hard off the ball. However, didn’t do enough in possession in final third.

Commendable: Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil worked hard for his team on Sunday night

Experience: Miroslav Klose lead the line well at the Maracana

MIROSLAV KLOSE - 7

A bit quiet. He’s a finisher and was too reliant on everybody else bringing him into the game. Didn’t have legs to keep up.

SUBSTITUTES

ANDRE SCHURRLE (for Kramer 29, 6.5)

Impact player normally but did job well on the left-hand side.

MARIO GOTZE (for Klose, 88)

The best moment of his life.

MANAGER

JOACHIM LOW – 7

Not the right call to hand Kramer his full debut. You were waiting for his Plan B but not sure there really was one.

TEAM AVG - 6.8

Best moment of his life: Mario Gotze's technique was superb... it was a superb touch

Motivator: Joachim Low has been superb tactically all tournament 

ARGENTINA

SERGIO ROMERO - 7

Looked very good and made a couple of smart saves, particularly in the first half. Dealt well with crosses, too. A commanding figure.

PABLO ZABALETA - 7.5

Got forward well and made a few vital interceptions. So important for Argentina and also made decent ventures forward.

MARTIN DEMICHELIS - 6.5

Was hanging on at times, just about making the right decisions. Had just enough pace to get by. Good for him that Klose isn’t fast.

EZEQUIEL GARAY - 6.5

Much quicker than Demichelis so provides a good balance. Not really troubled but dealt well with what was thrown at him.

Organised: Martin Demichelis and Ezequiel Garay were solid at the back for Argentina

MARCUS ROJO - 7

Another player with real pace. Didn’t go forward very much but awkward to beat. It’s not easy marking Muller.

JAVIER MASCHERANO - 7

No-nonsense performance. Would tackle his grandma. Was around the referee at every opportunity. Booked.

LUCAS BIGLIA - 7

He linked the defence and front players. That meant he covered a lot of ground and was very calm on the ball.

ENZO PEREZ - 6

Quieter than he was against Holland, when he impressed me a lot. Part of the hard-working midfield. Gave away no space.

Wasn't his day: Lionel Messi was encouraging for the South Americans, but couldn't quite lead them to victory

LIONEL MESSI - 7.5

Troubled Germany by running at them. Worked hard and came very deep for the ball. Poor miss early in second half.

GONZALO HIGUAIN - 5.5

Missed such an easy chance — scored a harder one against Belgium. Should have timed run better for disallowed goal, too.

Opener? Higuain thought he scored for Argentina in the first half, but he was yards offside

Fluffed his lines: The Napoli striker also scuffed his shot wide with just the goalkeeper to beat early on

EZEQUIEL LAVEZZI - 7

Has such pace. Is so direct and made yards every time he got the ball. Superb cross for disallowed goal. Blow to lose him injured.

SUBSTITUTES

SERGIO AGUERO (for Lavezzi 46, 6).

Looked fired up, desperate to make impact. Booked.

PALACIO (for Higuain 77, 6).

No real impact.

GAGO (for Perez 86).

MANAGER

ALEJANDRO SABELLA – 8

Sabella set his team up to be so much better organised than Brazil. Deserves credit for that. His team more dangerous.

REFEREE

NICOLA RIZZOLI (Italy) — 7

Big call not to send off Howedes. Didn’t notice him too much, which is a good thing. Was very firm withMascherano, who is difficult to referee as he is so mouthy.

ATTENDANCE: 74,738

Off at half-time: Argentina missed Ezequiel Lavezzi's pace
