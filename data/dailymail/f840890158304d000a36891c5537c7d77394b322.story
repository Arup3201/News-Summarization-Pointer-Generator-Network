Tycoon: Vasileios Omarov, seen outside Blackfriars Crown Court today, tried to 'buy off' the hotel worker he groped, the trial heard

A Russian business tycoon drunkenly groped a hotel worker's bottom then offered her thousands of pounds to drop her case against him, a court heard today.Vasileios Omarov, 44, tried to 'buy off' the woman after the incident a four star hotel in  central London, in December 2010, a jury was told. Instead of approaching her himself, the 'very rich' company director got Kiril Angelov, then head concierge at the hotel, to 'do his dirty work for him,' the court heard. 

The woman, who was at the time a senior guest relations manager tasked with looking after the hotel's elite clients, claims she was initially offered £2,000 not to give evidence, then £4,000, and eventually £5,000 plus a 'favour for the future' when she refused.The pair were arrested when the 'terrified' woman went to police in May 2011 - days before Omarov's sexual assault trial was due to begin, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Chronic alcoholic Omarov, who is currently staying in The Priory, later admitted a reduced charge of unlawful assault, the court was told.Omarov, who arrived at today's hearing in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, is now in the dock again alongside Angelov accused of perverting the course of justice. Benjamin Temple, prosecuting, said: 'The first defendant, Vasileios Omarov, is, on the Crown's understanding, a Russian-born Greek national residing in London. 'He is a very successful businessman who, by anyone's standards, is very rich. 'The second, Kiril Angelov, is a Bulgarian national who was, at the time, head concierge in the hotel.'

Mr Temple said an incident took place at the London hotel where Omarov was a paying guest.'Just before Christmas on December 18th Mr Omarov was by anyone's standards intoxicated in the hotel,' he said.

'He was very drunk, was on medication and was in a very bad way. 'At about 4.45pm a member of staff saw him at a computer terminal at the concierge counter. He was urinating on the desk and on himself. 'He was asked to leave and he assaulted one of the staff, the lady in the indictment. 'She told him his behaviour was unacceptable and wanted to escort him to his room on the first floor so he could pack his things. 'Initially he said "okay" and followed her to the lift, but he decided he wanted to check out first,' Mr Temple said.

'At the desk she stood just to the right of him within touching distance of him, and that's precisely what he did. He touched her with an open palm over her clothes on her buttocks.

'She told him not to touch her and he replied: "F*** off".

'He then walked to the lobby bar where he was ultimately escorted to his room, the police were called and he was arrested.'

'Very successful': The court heard the businessman, who arrived at his trial in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, was so drunk on the night in question he could barely stand

The court heard Omarov was so drunk at the time he could barely stand up, kept bumping into guests and at one point hugged a staff member and made him walk around the restaurant with him. When he was interviewed by police he denied there was any sexual element to the touching and claimed he had little memory of it as he was 'worse for wear on drink and medication'.Mr Temple added: 'What happened in the run up to the trial was that this rich businessman tried to buy her off. He offered her money to drop the case. 'As a rich businessman he is no doubt used to having people run errands for him so he enlisted a "fixer" - the concierge - to do his dirty work for him, and they were in it together.'

Trial: The Russian-born company director, seen right outside court, is accused of perverting the course of justice

Giving evidence the woman said she was approached by Angelov on three occasions in 2011. The first time, on April 27th, was in the hotel canteen while the second and third on May 1st and May 2nd were in the hotel's basement car park. She told jurors: 'Kiril said he had been approached by Mr Omarov and that he wanted to offer me money not to go to court. 'I said: "Is this for real? It seems like a movie. Does he take me for a fool?"'He said Mr Omarov was a respectable gentleman and going to court would embarrass him in his society.'She said she continued to refuse the offer, but on the third occasion she claims Angelov became 'upset and aggressive' with her. 'He said "Listen, Mr Omarov is offering a maximum of £5,000 and a favour in the future. He is a very important gentleman. If he goes to jail for three months, what benefit is it to you?"'He said he couldn't sleep as Mr Omarov was calling him all the time. I said I couldn't sleep myself. 'I was genuinely frightened. It's something that I still think about.'Afterwards the woman, who still works for the chain as a sales executive at a different hotel, said she went to police because she was 'really terrified'.She broke down as she added: 'I was really scared that day. I was scared to go home.'Omarov and Angelov, of Edgware, north west London, deny the charge against them. The trial continues.
