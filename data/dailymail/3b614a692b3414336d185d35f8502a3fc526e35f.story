These pictures from inside a McDonald's show the moment a masked robber pulled out a knife and started threatening terrified workers.

The brazen thief, dressed in a black and white striped jumper - much like Ronald McDonald's nemesis the Hamburglar, walked into the fast food restaurant before vaulting the counter and brandishing a six-inch knife.

He then forced staff to open a safe and hand over cash, before leaping back over the tills and making a getaway in a van parked outside.

The burglar, who did not harm anyone in the restaurant, is said to have escaped with a bag full of 20p coins.

The robbery took place shortly after 1am on November 27 at the McDonald's at Parsonage Retail Park in Leigh, Greater Manchester.

Traumatised staff described the tattooed burglar as being white, about 5ft 7in tall, of slim build and having a local accent. 

As well as the black and white jumper, the man was wearing grey jogging bottoms with stripes down each leg, white trainers, black gloves, and a black balaclava.

Police are investigating and are appealing for witnesses and information.  

Detective Constable Stuart Woodhead, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Fortunately no-one was hurt, but staff were understandably terrified as the man threatened them with a knife.

'I would urge you to look at the CCTV images closely.

'The offender has a distinctive tattoo on his left shoulder/neck and someone may recognise it and, if you do, I would urge you to contact police.'

Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 7225 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
