Snakes are sneaky creatures that can be found almost anywhere.

From the freezing Arctic to the planet’s arid deserts, these animals are talented travellers.

Now space scientists are planning to use this talent to explore a much tougher location- the hostile surface of Mars. 

A team from the SINTEF research 
institute in Trondheim, Norway, is studying how snake robots could be 
used to gather samples from hard-to-reach places on the red planet.

The work is part of a feasibility study by the European Space Agency (ESA) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide.

One idea is to use a conventional rover, such as Curiosity, to carry the robot snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover can’t access.

So far, NASA has landed four rovers on Mars. These are solar-powered robots with six wheels and robotic arms that can take soil samples and operate cameras.

Sojourner landed in 1997, Spirit and Opportunity in 2003, while the more advanced Curiosity was landed last summer.

‘Manoeuvrability is a challenge. The Spirit rover was lost after it became stuck in the sand on Mars,’ said Pål Liljebäck and Aksel Transeth at SINTEF ICT.

‘The vehicles just cannot get to many of the places from which samples have to be taken.’

At the moment, soil samples from Mars are analysed on board the rover itself, and the results are sent back to Earth.

But this takes time. Even moving at light speed, results from Mars take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of Earth.

ESA also wants to explore options that could allow samples to be returned to Earth for more detailed analysis, which an extra terrestrial snake robot may help achieve.

The group have already developed Wheeko, an experimental snake robot, to study snake robot motion across flat surfaces. 

The robot consists of 10 identical joint modules, each having two motorised degrees of freedom.

The modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground friction, which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces.

‘We are looking at several alternatives to enable a rover and a robot to work together,’ said Mr Transeth.

‘Since the rover has a powerful energy source, it can provide the snake robot with power through a cable extending between the rover and the robot.

‘If the robot had to use its own batteries, it would run out of power and we would lose it.’

‘One option is to make the robot into one of the vehicle's arms, with the ability to disconnect and reconnect itself, so that it can be lowered to the ground, where it can crawl about independently.'

The researchers envisage a cable 
connecting the robot to the vehicle to supply power and communication 
signals and also help winch it back in.

‘The connection between the robot and the rover also means that the snake robot will be able to assist the vehicle if the latter gets stuck’, said Mr Liljebäck.

‘In such a situation, the robot could lower itself to the ground and coil itself around a rock enabling the rover to pull itself loose by means of the cable winch, which the rover would normally use to pull the snake robot towards the rover.’

Another option would be for the robot to be located underneath or on top of the rover.

This would require a hoisting mechanism to pick up the robot, lift it up and connect it to the rover.

The researchers, who are working with CIRiS (Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space) and NSC (the Norwegian Space Centre), plan to publish a detailed report on the extra-terrestrial snake robot in December.
