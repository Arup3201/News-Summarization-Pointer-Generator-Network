A teacher was killed after he suffered a fatal allergic reaction when he ate a piece of bread without realising it had nuts in it.

Music teacher Andrew Turner, 38, went into sudden anaphylactic shock after he ate the bread with some soup while at a friend’s house in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Today his family told of Mr Turner's death as they warned other allergy sufferers to take care when staying away from home over Christmas.

Andrew Turner, 38, died from a fatal allergic reaction after eating a piece of bread that contained nuts

Speaking from the family home in St Donats, near Cardiff, Mr Turner's mother, Claudette, father, Ian, and brother Anthony, said he had always been 'very careful' to avoid nuts because even smelling them on people’s breath would make him ill.

But he had no idea there were nuts in the wholegrain bread when he dipped the crust into the soup.  Mr Turner went into sudden anaphylactic shock and paramedics were unable to save him.

Mrs Turner described her son's death on 26 November as a 'terrible tragedy'.

She said: 'Andrew was always very careful after being diagnosed with the allergy at the age of three.

'We suspected a horse hair allergy and when he was tested they found one for nuts as well, but Andrew was always very sensible child and he took great care with what he ate.

'He could even smell nuts on people’s breath - and would feel unwell as a result.'

Mr Turner, who had just accepted a new job teaching music, was always extremely careful with his allergy

She said her son had been so careful about his allergy that the question of carrying an epipen, used by those with allergies to administer a rapid dose of adrenalin, 'simply never arose'.

Music teacher Andrew had been tutoring part time in Swansea but had recently accepted a new job in Cardiff.

A spokeswoman for Anaphylaxis UK, a charity that raises awareness of the dangers of allergies, warned people to be especially vigilant over Christmas.

She said: 'There are lots of factors that can contribute towards an individual’s sensitivity at any particular time.

'Surviving a severe reaction can depend on factors such as how soon they receive emergency medication and the first aid treatment following the reaction.'
