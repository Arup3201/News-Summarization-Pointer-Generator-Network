Addiction: Danny Bowman, 19, became so obsessed with seeking perfection he took an overdose at his Newcastle home

When Danny Bowman was at school, he was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image.

But his addiction, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight.

He did not leave his house in Newcastle upon Tyne for six months, and when he failed to take the flawless shot, he tried to kill himself by taking an overdose.

His mother, Penny, managed to save him, but he was forced to seek help after his addiction had spiralled out of control.

The 19-year-old believed to be Britain's first selfie addict, has now had therapy to treat his technology addiction, OCD and Body dysmorphic disorder – an excessive anxiety about personal appearance.

He has not taken a picture of himself in seven months, and has realised that achieving perfection is impossible.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was constantly in search of taking the perfect selfie and
 when I realised I couldn’t I wanted to die.

I lost my friends, my 
education, my health and almost my life.

'The only thing I cared about was having my phone with me so I could 
satisfy the urge to capture a picture of myself at any time of the day.'

He would look at photos of his 'idol' Leonardo Di Caprio and would then replicate his poses.

Danny's dream was to become a male model, and it was an successful casting session in 2011 that ignited the obsession.

He would take 10 photos of himself before he washed and would sneak out of class three times every hour.

At 16, he dropped out of school so he could focus on his addiction, and his diet began to deteriorate.

His parents, who are both mental health nurses, tried to confiscate his phone, but he became aggressive.

When he posted the images on 
Facebook, he said people would write negative comments, with one saying 
his nose was too big while another mocked his complexity.

He told ITV's Daybreak: 'Perfection is impossible. I just kept taking them and taking them.

'I wanted to have one that was completely flawless. It was ten hours a day, 200 selfies.

'I think this kind of thing can happen to anyone, for me it manifested itself in selfies; it could be something different for someone else.

'This would not have happened if it was not in the media age.

The programme's psychiatrist Dr. Linda Papadopoulos said that modern day pressures are getting to some younger people.

She said: 'You add on to that this cultural need to almost release press releases for ourselves.

'It's like people saying "look at my life" and "look how exciting my life is".'

The selfie craze has grown in past 
five years, with stars, ­politicians and even Pope Francis posting 
getting involved in the sensation.

But
 one psychologist at a clinic where Danny was treated said the addiction
 with taking selfies has now become a mental illness.

Now
 determined to raise awareness of the anxiety disorder, Danny is working
 with Fixers – a national charity helping young people ‘to ‘fix’ the 
issues that matter to them.

He said their help has kept him alive and called on others to seek help before they end up in hospital.

Danny spoke to Daybreak's Dr Ranj about his experiences of the disorder, which distorted his view of himself

Many people feel unhappy about the way they look at some point in their life, but for some, it can become a mental illness with long-lasting effects.

The condition causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and have a distorted view of how they look.

They may be convinced a scar has developed into a major flaw that everyone is starring at.

All ages can be affected, but it usually begins in adolescence and does not necessarily mean the person is vain.

The condition can lead to the person becoming depressed and may, in cases like Danny's, lead to thoughts of suicide.
