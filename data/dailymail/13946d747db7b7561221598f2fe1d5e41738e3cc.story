Mike Catt is just the man to evaluate the hype around Jonathan Joseph and the comparisons being made with Jeremy Guscott, as the long span of his career meant he played with both centres.

After England’s man of the moment touched down twice at Twickenham on Saturday, following a try-scoring contribution to the victory in Cardiff, the ‘new Guscott’ tag was being applied with more conviction than ever.

Catt, the national team’s attacking skills coach, worked with Joseph during his transition from playing to coaching at London Irish, so he has been aware of his potential for several years.

Asked about the comparisons with his former Bath and England accomplice, Catt said: ‘I made them four years ago but he’s a different player. Jerry was more of a swerving outside centre, when there’s a big hole in the 13 channel.

‘There aren’t many holes any more, so JJ’s footwork and his ability to slip out of tackles, like you saw (on Saturday) and last week, is phenomenal. That’s the X factor you need to win games. You know you need the X factor like that to be able to break defences down.

‘But Jerry got 70-odd caps so we’ll see how many JJ gets. He’s got a lot more tries to get, to be fair to Guscott. But three from eight caps is not bad. It’s brilliant to see, it’s refreshing.’

There were many satisfying aspects of England’s six-try demolition of Italy which maintained the fine start to their RBS 6 Nations crusade and a few glaring problems to address. But as the capacity crowd dispersed there was no doubt about the primary subject for excited discussion.

Joseph is creating a buzz. He has been the form centre in the country this season and now his stellar form has transferred seamlessly to the Test arena. His tries on Saturday came after he had been shunted out to the wing as part of a reshuffle caused by the early loss of Mike Brown.

The 23-year-old’s first try, from turnover ball near halfway, featured a glorious side-step and a turbo-charged burst clear of the covering defenders. His second strike was expertly crafted by George Ford’s delayed pass to send him hurtling through a gap.

Catt is delighted to see confirmation of the promise he saw years ago as Joseph shows there is a place in the modern international game for subtle attacking qualities amid the thunder of heavy cavalry.

‘Everybody thinks international rugby is all about size but players who play against Jonathan Joseph don’t want to defend him because he’s lethal,’ he said. ‘He’s a hard man to stop. He has incredible feet.

‘He’s very hard to break down if you get the ball to him early, and that’s where George (Ford) has been phenomenal. George gives him early ball and then he’s able to see what’s in front of him. He just plants guys down and gets round them. He’s never tackled behind the gain line. He always makes an extra two or three metres and that’s crucial when it comes to attack, especially in the 13 channel.’

Joseph’s exploits from the flank against Italy will give the England coaches cause to consider him as a wing option if they ever have their full midfield contingent fit. 

But he is making a powerful case for a long run in his preferred position at outside centre. 

The No 13 shirt was seemingly only made to measure for Manu Tuilagi but the Leicester wrecking ball faces a battle to regain his place when he returns from injury.

‘Going into a World Cup you’ve got to have four centres,’ said Catt, a member of the victorious 2003 England team. ‘Having guys like Manu who can break down a defence in a different way to how JJ does is what you want. You’ve got a good balance there — and competition.

‘For Manu to get his place back you’re going to have to see some fireworks. Let’s see how it carries on going. It’s just great to have a consistency again between a centre partnership. We’ll see how they develop. I’m sure they will.’

Catt said there will have to be 'fireworks' from Manu Tuilagi (centre) to regain his place in the England side

Catt also praised the impressive performances of George Ford in England's Six Nations campaign so far

England coach Stuart Lancaster will want to see his side combat the sluggish start made against Italy

England were far too strong for Italy but Lancaster’s tempered reaction to the victory told its own tale of shortcomings which must be addressed. 

A repeat of Saturday’s sluggish start will be far harder to recover from against Ireland in Dublin in 13 days’ time when the championship’s two unbeaten teams collide.

Of the six English tries, the first by Billy Vunipola owed much to a generous interpretation of the footage by the TMO. Joseph’s finishes were sublime, while Ben Youngs was alert enough to pounce with a quick tap penalty from close range when the visitors’ defence had switched off.

The other scorers were the recalled Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter, which went some way to justifying their return to the Test fold.

Captain Chris Robshaw had a titanic influence as usual — topping the tackle charts as always with 18, while his Harlequins skipper Joe Marler built on his superb autumn campaign with another imposing display.

In the second row, George Kruis again belied his inexperience with a forceful contribution and No 8 Vunipola ran amok as the game wore on.

But Lancaster was rightly concerned by a dip in defensive intensity which allowed the Italians to score three tries.

In attacking terms, Jonny May created Cipriani’s try but lacked composure when he squandered a three-on-one overlap just before half-time. Such fundamental lapses are not critical in a one-sided encounter but they could be fatal in a World Cup knock-out match.

Still, clear room for improvement from a winning position is probably the management’s ultimate scenario at this juncture.
