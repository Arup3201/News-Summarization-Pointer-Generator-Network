The teenagers who were sexually assaulted by former New York Yankee Chad Curtis have filed a complaint  alleging members of the school board were 'devoted to him'  even after his sex conviction.

Curtis, 46, is currently serving seven to 15 years in prison after a Michigan jury convicted him of criminal sexual misconduct in 2013 while he was a coach at Lakewood High School.

He  sexually assaulted three young girls - two of whom were only 15 at the time  - in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach.

According to the teenagers who have filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Education members of the school board acted improperly and sent him jail house prayers.

Forgiveness: In a shocking jail house interview in 2014, from Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian repeated his claims that his victims made the allegations up

Four students have filed a federal lawsuit against Curtis and the school district. Evidence uncovered during that process included text messages and emails that are part of the complaint. 

According to NBC, the complaint highlights the fact that school board member Brian Potter wrote to Curtis after the first molestation charge was made in 2012.

Potter wrote to the ex-outfielder: 'Some words of encouragement that have been running through my mind. 

'You have lived and continue to live a righteousness life that no on[e], or no word can take away. Nothing can separate you from our father. Praise God.' 

During his glittering decade-long career, Curtis received acclaim for hitting a walk-off home run during Game 3 of the 1999 World Series. 

He also played for a half-dozen teams but has maintained he is innocent and that the girls lied about being groped and violated during secret sports massage sessions. 

Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32. 

He was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration.

In a shocking jail house interview in 2014 from Harrison Correctional Facility in Michigan, the staunch Christian repeated his claims that his victims made the allegations up.

Describing one of his victims, then a 15-year-old sophomore, he declared: 'She'll wake up, throw up her hands and just say, 'I can't do it anymore. And when that happens, I have every intention of forgiving her.'

Support: Curtis hugged his wife center, and children after the verdict was read out during his trial

But his victims said members of the school board including Potter and fellow board member Gary Foltz also supported him with post-conviction character references.

In addition, they acted as members of his 'prayer team.' 

The victims' lawyer, Douglas Fierberg said that the school board's support for Curtis occurred despite some of his victims being harassed for coming forward about the abuse.

This was particularly difficult as two of them still attended Lakewood school.  

The complaint said Curtis 'was revered at Lakewood both for his celebrity, and for the persona as a 'man of faith' he perpetuated at the school, and at a nearby church.

'This blind devotion to Curtis is evident throughout Curtis's tenure at Lakewood, and in all of Lakewood's dealings with Curtis and Curtis's victims.' 

In addition the victims said that they did not receive any protection after they made the allegations against him.

In response to the complaint, Lakewood Superintendent Mike O'Mara said he could not comment because of pending litigation.

However, the school's lawyers told NBC that it had no idea Curtis was molesting the students before they came forward and immediately cooperated with police and barred him from school. 

A spokesman for the Education Department said an assessment of the complaint is ongoing.
