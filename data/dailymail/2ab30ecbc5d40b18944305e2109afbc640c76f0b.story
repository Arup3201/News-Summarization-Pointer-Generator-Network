Nearly 300 Amtrak passengers were left stranded on a cold, dark train for more than three hours after it lost power in snowy Connecticut - and then a train sent to rescue them broke down too.

The 299 commuters were stuck without any lights or heat after their Boston-bound train came to a halt while traveling near Mystic at 6.25pm on Thursday, Amtrak spokesman Craig Schulz said.

It is believed that the vehicle lost hour due to ice and snow on the overhead power system. Within an hour, another train from Lynchburg, Virginia, to Boston was sent  to pick up the restless passengers.

However, it also lost power when it neared Acela train 2164. At around 9.30pm, more than three hours after the first train broke down,  the passengers were transferred to a train on adjacent tracks.

Having a joke: Kevin Mimoso tweeted: 'On a disabled Ascela with no power in Ct/RI border. Flashlight anyone?'

The second train,  carrying 400 passengers, regained power at about 9.45pm, officials said.

During the time that the Acela train was broken down, commuters took to social media to document their experiences of being stranded on-board the vehicle, which had set off from Washington DC.

One female Twitter user, with the handle @yaelbt, wrote: 'Someone just shut off the train @Amtrak #stranded', before adding: 'I predict a Lord Of The Flies situation will start soon.'

She later joked: 'Update: We are putting together a team to go hunt small animals for dinner.'

Snowy state: Connecticut is currently blanketed in snow after a snowstorm swept across the region on Thursday, bringing sub-zero temperatures to many parts. Record cold is forecast along the shoreline Friday

Meanwhile, user Kevin Mimoso, posted a photo of a dark train carriage, writing: 'On a disabled Ascela with no power in Ct/RI border, awaiting rescue from another train. Flashlight anyone?'

And one user, Christine Talcott, who works in sales operations, tweeted: 'Crossing "stranded on a broken down train" off my bucket list #@Amtrak #WinterStormThor #acela.'

After the second train broke down, she added: 'Now the rescue train is broken. Sitting for an hour in darkness. Can't make this up.' Some passengers  used glow sticks to create  light on the train.

Lauryn Bennett, 30, who was on the rescue train - Northeast Regional 176 - also tweeted about being trapped on a 'loud, crowded train'. She described the crew as 'patient and hard-working'.

Huge delay: Mr Schulz said no passengers nor crew were injured on the Acela train (file picture). After being transferred onto the relief train - on which, many had to stand - they finally arrived at South Station at 11.27pm

Mr Schulz said no passengers nor crew were injured on the Acela train. After being transferred onto the relief train - on which, many had to stand - they finally arrived at South Station at 11.27pm. 

'It’s likely to be a weather-related issue here, ice and snow build-up on the overhead power system,' he told the Boston Globe, adding refunds/vouchers would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. 

He advised that affected passengers contact Amtrak at 1-800-USA-Rail.
