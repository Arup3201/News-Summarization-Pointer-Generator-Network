Billionaire property investor Jeff Greene recently spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he believes people in the United States need to stop aiming so high and start living with less.

'America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence,' Greene, who ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida in 2010, said in an interview.

'We need to reinvent our whole system of life.'

The only issue Americans took with the 60-year-old's opinions was, well, everything, given he owns a $195 million palace in Beverly Hills, which has 23 bathrooms and a rotating dance floor, as well as four other blue ribbon properties, and is famous for throwing wild parties on a 145-foot yacht, Yahoo! Homes reported.

This is 'living with less'?: Billionaire property investor Jeff Greene, 60, who recently said the 'lifestyle expectations of Americans is far too high', is the owner of America's most expensive home - this Beverly Hills estate - which is listed for $195 million

Greene's claim to real estate fame is the Palazzo di Amore, or Palace of Love, that sits on 25 acres in Beverly Hills and includes a vineyard that produces 400 to 500 cases of private label wine a year.

It became the most expensive home in the U.S. last year when Greene listed it for $195 million.

The main house is 35,000-square-feet, with 12 bedrooms, including a master suite measuring 5,000-square-feet.

There is a a 15,000-square-foot entertainment center with a bowling alley, 50-seat theater, a 10,000-bottle cellar and a kitchen with a walk-in fridge.

Greene paid $35 million for the property in 2007 when it was unfinished, and has since spent between $25 and $40 million completing it.

Bungalow: The house backs onto the beach in Malibu and is where Greene often stays

However, the estate is often rented out to royal families and other visiting internationals for hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, and Greene and his wife, Chinese-Australian real estate executive Mei Sze Chan, usually spend their time at a more modest beach-front abode in Malibu.

Greene built the three-story modern bungalow in 2010.

The home has four bedroom, windows throughout overlooking the ocean, and backs right onto the sand.

It is currently listed as for sale at $11.5 million.

Prime real estate: When not in California, Greene spends time at this sprawling estate in Palm Beach, Florida

Greene also keeps a prized home in that other luxury real estate mecca, Palm Beach, Florida.

There he has a trophy property called La Bellucia - or 'beautiful lady' - which he bought in 2009 for $24 million.

The estate dates back to 1920.

The main house has nine bedrooms and, like the Malibu home, backs straight onto the water. 

And, also like his other properties, he performed extensive renovations to expand the existing structure. 

At the time of the purchase, Greene's estimated fortune was $1.3 billion, which ranked him him as number 317 on the list of the 400 Richest Americans in 2009.

Spacious: In 2011 Greene purchased this parcel of land in New Haven, New York, for $36 million

An entrepreneur like Greene would not consider his portfolio complete without a house in Hamptons.

And in 2011 he completed that by buying a sprawling 55-acre peninsula in New Haven known as Tyndal Point.

The purchase gave Greene three separate houses, two docks, and 3,000 feet of private beach.

The initial price was rumored to be $41 million, but Curbed later reported that the final sale was $36 million. 

Bachelor pad: Before getting married, Greene resided in this Beverly Hills house, which comes complete with a dance club

Greene's fifth property is his oldest.

Bought in 2002, before his 2007 marriage, the Beverly Hills abode has come to called Greene's 'bachelor pad'.

Yahoo reported the house has five bedrooms and, as every single man needs, a 1,000-bottle wine cellar and a dance club. 

Greene paid $1.575 million for it and, after languishing on the market for years, recently offloaded it for $8.9 million. 

Expert: Greene reportedly manages about $2 billion in financial investments, more than $750 million in real estate and at least $1.5 billion in assorted property development projects

Greene's controversial comments at the World Economic Forum came during an interview with Bloomberg.

In it he said he said the United States is facing a job crisis that is going to lead to social unrest.

Greene said Greene says he  manages about $2 billion in financial investments, more than $750 million in real estate and at least $1.5 billion in assorted property development projects.

And he does it all on his own, without investors or partners, he said. 

'I'm remarkably long for my level of pessimism,' he said. 

'Our economy is in deep trouble. 

'We need to be honest with ourselves. 

'We've had a realistic level of job destruction, and those jobs aren't coming back.'
