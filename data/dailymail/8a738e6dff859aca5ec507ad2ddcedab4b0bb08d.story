Icy pleasure: Vice Cream is a 'female-only' ice-cream that promises to heat things up in the bedroom

Th dessert is the brainchild of London-based ice-cream manufacturers The Licktators

Vice Cream is made with Ecuadorian chocolate, plant-based pleasure enhancer Lady Prelox and thick, creamy British whipping cream.

According to The Licktators, the  ice-cream was created to 'give women's sexual appetites a deliciously natural boost'. 

The Ecuadorian chocolate, they say, will stimulate the release of serotonins, the brain's natural pleasure-enhancers.

The dessert also contains a dash of Lady Prelox, a natural, plant-based pleasure enhancer made from pine bark that boosts libido and encourages blood-flow to the sexual regions.

Finally, the experience is enhanced by the addition of whipped cream which, the makers say can 'be eaten, shared - or even applied to intimate areas' as things get steamy.

The new ice-cream was made in the The Licktators' secret south London 'Whipping Room.'

The company is well-known for its inventive flavour combinations and unique product names and is behind General Custard, a vanilla custard ice-cream; chocolate and praline Choc N Roll Rehab; Jiggu Pop popcorn ice-cream; cinnamon doughnut flavour Doughnut Disturb; Marshmallow Law and John Lemon, made with lemon curd and British milk and cream.

Miss Whiplash, head of the The Licktator's Whipping Room, said they hope to see women 'screaming for Vice Cream on Valentine's Day'.

She added: 'For many women, eating chocolate ice cream is already a sensual experience. So we thought why not turn the volume up to 11 and give all the lovely ladies out there a big, raunchy boost.

'Whether you think you need it or not, or you simply fancy recreating the ice cream scene from Fifty Shades of Grey, bringing Vice Cream into your life can only make your sex life saucier.'

Lady Prelox is a dietary supplement made by German company Horphag Research. 

On their website they say it is meant to  'synergistically promote sexual comfort and pleasure' and was developed exclusively for women to give them a fulfilling sex life.

Its makers say the product was clinically tested on more than 200 women. 

It contains pycnogenol, a botanical extract from the bark of the French maritime pine tree, known for its potent antioxidant properties and proven to expand and support healthy blood vessels.

The product also contains branded and patented rose hip extract Rosvita, a potent antioxidant containing vitamin C, which contributes to normal psychological function an reduction of tiredness and fatigue.

The other ingredients in Lady Prelox are the amino acids L-Arginine and L-Citrulline. 

L-Arginine plays an important role in nitric oxide mechanisms in the body. Nitric oxide is crucial for the regulation of blood flow to the genital area and plays a critical role in sex drive and sexual satisfaction.

L-Citrulline is naturally occurring amino acid. As a precursor of L-Arginine, it has been shown to help open up veins and arteries to improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure.
