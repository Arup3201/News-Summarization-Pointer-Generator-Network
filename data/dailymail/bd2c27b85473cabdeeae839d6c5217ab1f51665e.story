Murdered: Jamie McMahon, 26, was found dead after stopping to eat a takeaway in a churchyard

A man found murdered in a church graveyard after stopping to eat a takeaway may have been killed in a robbery which went wrong, police claimed last night.

Jamie McMahon, 26, from Northampton, was found by a member of the public near St Giles Church in the town centre at around 7.45am on Wednesday morning.

Mr McMahon, who had spent the night playing snooker with friends suffered a violent attack that left him with head and facial injuries.

He was last seen alive shortly after 2am and is believed to have gone to the churchyard to eat some food.

Assistant chief constable Russ Foster, of Northamptonshire Police, said: 'We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry. We cannot rule out robbery as a motive and that is a line of inquiry at the moment.

'We are awaiting further test results to confirm his exact cause of death.

'This does appear to be an isolated incident. We have a team of detectives across the region working with us to try and piece together the events leading up to Jamie’s death and also to identify any suspects.'

Detective inspector Louise Hemingway, who is working on the investigation, said: 'We know that Jamie was enjoying a night out with some friends and had been playing snooker earlier on, on Tuesday evening.

'We think that maybe Jamie came into the churchyard to eat food that he purchased but from that point onwards we really don’t know what happened and that’s why we need help from members of the public.'

Yesterday family members described him as 'the most lovable, caring young man', and appealed for anyone with information about the murder to contact the police.

'We are devastated to lose our beloved Jamie in such tragic circumstances,' they said.

'He was the most lovable, caring young man, with a tremendous sense of humour and a contagious smile. We are so proud that he was part of our family.

'He would do absolutely anything for anyone, which has been evident in the enormous amount of messages we have received from his large circle of friends.

'We are overwhelmed and comforted by the heart warming and wonderful tributes that have been flooding in from far and wide.'
