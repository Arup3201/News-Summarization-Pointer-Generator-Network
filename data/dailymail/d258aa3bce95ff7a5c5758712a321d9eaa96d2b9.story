Louis van Gaal has received the backing of Manchester United legend Gary Neville, who strongly believes the Dutchman shouldn't be sacked - even if the club fails to finish in the top four.

United, who were beaten by Swansea on Saturday, are currently fourth but face strong competition from Southampton, Liverpool and Spurs for a place in the European elite.

Speaking on talkSPORT, Neville says he is fully behind Van Gaal, who has come under pressure in recent weeks, despite his side only losing once in their last five.

Neville did admit however that finishing outside the Champions League places would be a failure

He said: 'Louis van Gaal should not be sacked [if Manchester United fail to make the top four].

'It would be a terrible season for Man United and Louis van Gaal. He would probably say it was a big failure because he knows his job this season.

'He has to get in the Champions League but, on the other hand, if he didn't, no, you can't just sack a manager one year and then sack another manager the year after. Where do you go from there?

'There has to be a level of continuity. I absolutely believe this time there will be continuity at Man United and they will stand by him even if he doesn't finish in the top four and that's the right thing to do.'

Neville is still hopeful his former side can qualify for the Champions League but admits they need to step up and make the final part of the season count.

'I still think Manchester United will finish in the top four, he added. 'I think they will scrape in.

'At the start of the season I thought they'd finish third.

'There is a period in March where they have Arsenal in an FA Cup quarter-final, then they have Spurs the Sunday after and Liverpool after that. There is an international break and then they have got Aston Villa, Man City and Chelsea.

'That will be a big period but, actually, Van Gaal and Man United started the season really poorly and these big games came along and they seemed to grow.

'I'd like to think these games will inspire some of the bigger players at Man United. They need to step up their performances. There is no doubt about that.'
