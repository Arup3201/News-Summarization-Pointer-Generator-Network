The curtain came down on another thrilling Champions League group stage this week.

We must now wait until February before Europe’s premier competition resumes with the two-legged knockout rounds.

But, for now, Sportsmail takes a look back over the group matches and assesses the winners and losers…

So who were the Invincibles?

Well, only one team waltzed through the group stage victorious in all six matches, and that was holders Real Madrid. They were irresistible as they stormed through Group B with 16 goals scored and just two conceded. Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema were the stars with five goals apiece.

Anyone else?

Just two other teams remain undefeated in this year’s competition – Chelsea and Porto, the current and former homes of Jose Mourinho. They progressed with near-identical records having won four and drawn two en route to the last 16.

Lionel Messi broke a couple of records, didn’t he?

Not quite yet… He did break Raul’s record of 71 Champions League goals – winning the race ahead of Ronaldo – but the Barcelona star has only drawn level with the former Real Madrid captain when it comes to goals in all European competitions. The pair have 76. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has 75, meaning he could still beat Messi to that title.

So Messi must have been top scorer in the group stages?

With eight goals you would think so. But Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano, of Shakhtar Donetsk, managed to smash an incredible nine goals as the Ukrainians made it through to the second phase. Adriano, though, was something of a flat-track bully – he scored five of his goals in a 7-0 win at Belarussian side BATE Borisov before adding a hat-trick in the return fixture.

So Adriano was the top scorer, which team netted the most?

With 17, that honour goes to Chelsea. The 6-0 home drubbing of Slovenian side Maribor helped in that respect, as did the four penalties they scored, which was more than any other team.

And the tightest defence?

Monaco somehow conceded just once as they topped Group C. Still, though, they did not qualify until the final game when they defeated Zenit 2-0. In fact, Group C was a bit of a turn-off. From 12 matches, just 17 goals were scored.

And the leakiest backline?

It’s no surprise to see BATE Borisov – shipping an average of four goals per game – emerge as the worst defence. In response, they scored just twice, and that double was enough to earn them a shock 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao.

Did anyone scrape through?

Basle lost three matches but still managed to progress, at the expense of Liverpool. Their 1-1 draw at Anfield on Tuesday night took their points tally to a meagre seven, but that was still enough to win a place in the knockout rounds with two points to spare over the third-placed Reds.

And who were the unlucky losers?

Olympiacos boasted a 100 per cent record in Athens, but three defeats on the road meant their nine-point tally was not enough and they must now settle for the Europa League.

The big guns are all through, how does it compare to this time last year?

Zenit, Olympiacos, Milan and Galatasaray are the four teams missing who made it through to the second round 12 months ago. In their place are Shakhtar, Porto, Monaco and Juventus.

Who were the stars of the group stage?

It is hard to look past eight-goal Lionel Messi… again. He was outstanding for Barcelona and, in the year when Ronaldo is expected to enjoy a clean sweep of the individual honours, the Argentine served a reminder of his mesmerising ability on the biggest stage.

Chelsea’s Eden Hazard has produced his best on the European stage so far this season with two goals and two assists, while Manchester United's forgotten man Nani – on loan at Sporting – also starred in the Blues' group, but his two goals and four assists could only earn them a Europa League place.

Meanwhile, a pair of players to catch the eye for Porto – unbeaten to top Group H – were Algerian attacking midfielder Yacine Brahimi – who scored four and laid on two – and defensive midfielder Casemiro, the Real Madrid loanee who anchored their engine-room so impressively.

Any young players catch the eye?

Max Meyer of Schalke strengthened his reputation and it was his goal which sent the Germans into the second round. Roberto Di Matteo’s side needed victory in Maribor and the 19-year-old Germany midfielder came good half an hour from time to ensure it was they and not Sporting who progressed.

Koke, the Atletico Madrid playmaker, was arguably the best young player of the group phase. He scored twice and assisted four goals to further inflate a price tag which is said to top £30million.

Isco, of Real Madrid, and Lucas Moura of PSG are already players with big reputations, and they justified such hype as their respective sides enjoyed safe passage.

And Mario Gotze – the man who scored the winning goal for Germany in the World Cup final – continued his fine year with three goals for Bayern Munich.
