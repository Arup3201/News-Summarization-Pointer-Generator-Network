Better prevention: Cancer death rates have dropped significantly thanks to better screening for different types of the disease such as breast cancer

Cancer death rates in Britain have dropped to the lowest in 40 years thanks to more people quitting smoking and better screening.

Tens of thousands of people are now beating the disease every year as the disease is caught earlier and patients receive treatment at earlier stages.

Deaths rates for cancer sufferers aged between 50 and 59 have dropped 40 per cent from 310 for every 100,000 people in 1971 to 185 two years ago, according to Cancer Research UK.

And since 1971, deaths for the 50 to 
59 group have gone from more than 21,000 a year to less than 14,000 in 
2010 out of the 43,100 people of that age group diagnosed with cancer.

In
total 309,500 new cases are diagnosed across all age groups each year 
with 76,000 patients dying from the disease every year. 

Professor
Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician said: 'Our latest 
figures show that for the first time in the last four decades cancer 
deaths among people aged 50-59 have dropped below 14,000 a year.

'The reduction in people smoking has been a big help, and we are also better at diagnosing cancers early and better at treating them whether by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.'

Breakthrough drugs credited with helping slash death rates include tamoxifen, which is a hormone therapy mainly used to treat breast cancer.

The biggest falls in death rates among men were for stomach cancer, which fell by 83 per cent. This was followed by Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Testicular cancer. The biggest fall for women was cervical cancer, which fell by 80 per cent, followed by stomach cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

How premature cancer deaths have fallen

Someone in Britain is diagnosed with cancer every two minutes while more than one in three will develop some form of the disease in their lifetime.

There are more than 200 types of cancer but 40 per cent of all cancers are preventable if people make a few simple changes to their lives to minimise the risk.

These include doing more exercise, eating more fresh fruit and vegetables and less red meat, reducing alcohol intake, and keeping weight down and not smoking.

Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said: 'There is still so much more to do.  Smoking remains the largest cause of cancer which is why Cancer Research UK is petitioning the government to bring in plain packaging of tobacco so children are less likely to be seduced by the sophisticated marketing techniques designed to make smoking attractive to youngsters.'
