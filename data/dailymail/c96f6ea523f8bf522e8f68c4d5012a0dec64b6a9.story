 

After striking gold at the Ballon d'Or award ceremony, Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo was rewarded with diamonds.  

Nike, the Portuguese forward's sponsor, made the 'Mercurial CR7 Rare Gold' boots as a tribute to Ronaldo's remarkable year, in which he won the Champions League, Copa del Rey, European Super Cup, Club World Cup and Ballon d'Or.

The boots, which are primarily gold in colour, have 'micro diamonds' encrusted onto the CR7 logo towards the heel.

The US sportswear manufacturer revealed that the diamonds on the boots are the remnants of larger stones that have already been cut.

Ronaldo beat Barcelona star Lionel Messi and World Cup-winning goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to the recent FIFA award for the world's best footballer.

After winning the award, he said: 'It's been an unforgettable year. To win this trophy, a trophy of this kind, is something unique and all I can say is I want to continue working as I have so far, trying to go on to more titles - individual and as a team - for my mother, my father who is up there looking at there any my son.

'I can see my mother, my family. I would like to thank all those who voted for me. My coach, my fellow player, the president of my club.

'I want to get better as the days go by. I want to say to all the Portuguese that I never thought I could win this trophy on three different occasions.
