Tottenham star Christian Eriksen has been blamed by Denmark manager Morten Olsen for their last-gasp defeat by Portugal on Tuesday.

The 22-year-old was slammed by Olsen for his lack of impact in a Euro 2016 qualifier settled by Cristiano Ronaldo's last-gasp header.

Olsen ripped into Eriksen's lack of impact at international level and also indicated he hasn't continued his progression in the Premier League since leaving Ajax 14 months ago.

Tottenham midfielder Eriksen has admitted he needs to impose himself more when playing for Denmark

'It is a brutal world, otherwise you have to play at another level. It is not Ajax any more, this is not development,' said Olsen.

On Eriksen's display against Portugal, the Denmark manager added: 'After so many matches he could pick up the ball and help to control the game. He has not been able to.

'It is quite something when you have to criticise a player like Christian Eriksen. It should not take place.

'If it was a player at a lower level, one could say that he had no class. But with Christian Eriksen do not make the mistake. I must be tough and say to him. And he knows it well. 

Eriksen has enjoyed a promising start to the season with Spurs but Olsen says he hasn't improved in England

'Therefore, we blame him. He must stand up to the criticism, and he does too.'

Eriksen scored 10 times for Tottenham last season and has impressed so far this campaign for Mauricio Pochettino's side.

The Dane also netted the winner against Southampton in the last match before the current international fixtures but he admits he needs to do more for his country

'I was on the ball and should have brought myself more into the game,' said Eriksen.

'I am not getting the results in terms of goals and assists and that is not what I want. You can always hope to give your best but it was not one of those days.'
