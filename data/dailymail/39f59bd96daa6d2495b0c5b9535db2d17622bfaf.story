Paris Saint-Germain forward Ezequiel Lavezzi has admitted he often thinks about quitting football for good, and will not stay in the game when he retires.

There are rumours that the 29-year-old Argentinian is set to leave the French capital after two seasons, and he admits he has become disillusioned with the game he once loved.

'Sometimes I think about giving it all up. It's a thought running through my head today, not just in the past,' Lavezzi told Marca Plus. 'Once I leave football, I will not continue in the world of sport. Right now I don't know what I might do.'

Lavezzi joined PSG from Napoli after five years at the club, and has now played over 70 times in Paris

Lavezzi, who spent five years at Napoli before moving to France, did admit that football has given him some opportunities he couldn't have had without it, but believes there is a self-centred element to footballers. 

'Certainly the best thing that ties me to football is the possibility of living well, discovering new cultures, and spending time with my family when it's possible – I enjoy it all the more.

'The worst aspect of it is the environment, everyone is powered by their own interests. It's not all what it looks like from outside.'

With the transfer window now open, and the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal said to be showing an interest, it would not be a surprise to see Lavezzi make a fresh start.
