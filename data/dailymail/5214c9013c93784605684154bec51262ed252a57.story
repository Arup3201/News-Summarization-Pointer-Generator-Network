The humble fish finger celebrates its 60th anniversary next year and once accounted for 10 per cent of all the fish eaten in Britain.

But new statistics show that Britain could be falling out of love with the traditional teatime snack, with sales falling by more than two per cent this year.

While the breadcrumbed treat is struggling, fresh fish is doing better, with sales increasing, even while fresh meat sales, fresh poultry and game sales fell.

Britain is losing its taste for fish fingers after nearly 60 years as one of the nation's best loved teatime treats

Figures show that sales of all fish fingers, including own label and big name brands, fell by 2.2%

Price rises, shoppers choosing healthier, fresh alternatives and simply getting tired of the frozen favourite are all being blamed for the decline of the fish finger.

Big brands like Birds Eye, the original inventor of the snack, saw sales fall by up to seven per cent according to trade journal The Grocer.

Figures show sales of all fish fingers, including own label and big name brands, fell by 2.2 per cent to 28.7 million kilos in the 12 months to the end of August. 

The breaded fishy favourite is losing ground to fresh fish from the chiller cabinet - which saw sales rise to 0.3 per cent in volume, during the same period that fresh meat sales were down two per cent, and fresh poultry and game fell 2.3 per cent.

And sales of  'ambient' fish like tuna, salmon and crabmeat which can go in the cupboard and last much longer have risen 4.6 per cent in value and 2.1 per cent to 88 million kg a year in volume, the report said. 

Dinenrtime staple: Analysts say that diners are falling out of love with the treat as a snack in a sandwich

According to analysts, diners are falling out of love with the treat whether it is as a snack in a sandwich or served in the traditional way with chips and peas.

Part of this may be to do with habits - families are less likely to all sit round the table and eat together - or health reasons with alternative foods chosen for protein for instance. 

But experts say a lack of innovation and marketing has also contributed to the decline of the dinnertime staple.

No longer popular: Big brands like Birds Eye, the original inventor of the fish finger, saw sales fall by up to seven per cent. Fish fingers were first produced by Birds Eye in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1955

It added: 'It's enough to drive poor of Captain Birdseye to drink. Sales of frozen fish have continued on their downward trajectory this year.' 

Birds Eye senior brand manager Andrew Foster told The Grocer shoppers were seeking 'delicious guilt-free meal options' rather than products coated in batter or breadcrumbs.

Yvonne Adam of rivals Young's Seafood said: 'Consumers are looking for the best fish, made delicious, which is easy to cook, with health benefits and value for money promotions.'

The first fish fingers were produced by Birds Eye at their factory in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1955 and launched to British consumers on September 26 in the same year. 

They had originally been patented by the company's founder Clarence Birdseye in 1927 but it took years to create a commercial version.

Even though they were designed to be frozen, when they first when on sale, only one in five homes had a freezer so they had to be eaten almost immediately as if fresh.
