Tottenham fans may be wondering who new boss Mauricio Pochettino will sign as the club look to break into the Premier League's top four next season.

The 42-year-old joined the White Hart Lane outfit from rivals Southampton on Tuesday after an impressive 18-month spell with the south coast club.

The Argentine guided Saints to eighth this season as he strengthened the squad with three additions at the start of campaign.

Here at Sportsmail we review Pochettino's hattrick of signings at St Mary's and what type of players the Spurs faithful may expect in the future.

Shrewd business: Mauricio Pochettino made three signings at Southampton before joining Tottenham

Victor Wanyama

Signed for £12.5m on a four-year-deal from Celtic in July 2013.

He scored zero goals in 24 appearances in all competitions.

Kenyan endured an injury-plagued debut season.

Pochettino signed the influential midfielder after the young Kenyan had impressed during the previous campaign with Scottish Champions Celtic.

The 22-year-old managed to score nine times in the 2012-13 season, including one against Barcelona in the Champions League.

The £12.5million transfer fee was the highest amount that a Scottish club had received for a player, showing just how much belief Pochettino had in Wanyama.

The midfielder's first season with Southampton was a relatively quiet one in comparison to his final one in Glasgow.

The Kenyan suffered a serious injury in December 2013, during a match against Aston Villa - chipping a bone in his lower leg.

The subsequent incident meant he did not to return until February.

With his season ruined with injuries, Wanyama failed to score a single goal for Southampton and will be hoping to be more successful next season.

Pablo Daniel Osvaldo

Southampton's record signing at a fee of £14.6m from Roma in August 2013.

Scored three goals in 13 appearances.

Fined £40,000 and banned for three matches in January for a touch-line scuffle at Newcastle in December.

Loaned out to Juventus in January after breaking team-mate Jose Fonte's nose in a training ground fight.

The signing of Osvaldo turned out to be a very controversial and problematic one for Pochettino.

Osvaldo arrived in England with a bad reputation, having in the past had bust-ups at former clubs.

The Italy international had previously punched Roma team-mate, Erik Lamela, in the face for not passing him the ball during a match.

Osvaldo also had a training ground bust-up with Nicola Mingazzini whilst they were at Bologna.

The forward had seemingly put his troubles behind him when he grabbed his first goal for Southampton during a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace in September.

The 28-year-old’s troublesome past soon reappeared though as he was fined £40,000 and banned for three matches in January after getting involved in a touch-line scuffle at Newcastle in December.

Just weeks later Osvaldo found himself in yet another training ground fight and ended up breaking the nose of Southampton team-mate, Jose Fonte.

Osvaldo was subsequently sent out on-loan to Juventus for the remainder of the season and is likely to leave Southampton permanently during the summer.

Dejan Lovren

Signed for a fee of £8.5m from Lyon in June 2013.

Scored two goal

s in 31 appearances.

Part of Southampton defence that kept 15 clean sheets all season.

Arguably Pochettino’s best signing during his time at Southampton, Lovren has impressed a lot of people with his defensive performances this season.

The Croatia international was a vital member of a Southampton defence that managed to keep 15 clean sheets throughout the campaign.

Lovren was also impressive at the other end of the pitch, with one of his two goals coming at Anfield to give his side a historical 1-0 win over Liverpool.

The centre-back may have had an even better season had he not been ruled out for a few weeks in January, after suffering ankle ligament damage.

His performances mean Southampton may have a fight on their hands to keep Lovren at the club, with Liverpool, Manchester United and Roma all believed to be interested in the 24-year-old.
