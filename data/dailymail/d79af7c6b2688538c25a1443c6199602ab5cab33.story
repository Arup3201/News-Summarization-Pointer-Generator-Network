The futures of Cardiff City duo Steven Caulker and Fraizer Campbell look all but over after the pair were left out of the club's pre-season tour of Austria.

Towering centre back Caulker, rated at £8million, is the subject of interest from Crystal Palace, Southampton and QPR, while Palace have also bid for striker Campbell.

Caulker, 22, joined Cardiff last summer for £8m from Tottenham, while Campbell has been in South Wales since January 2013. Both players have one England cap.

Cardiff have heavily revamped their squad following relegation from the Barclays Premier League in May and it appears they are resigned to losing two of their prized assets.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has signed five players already this summer and takes his new-look squad to Austria on Thursday.

Cardiff begin their season in the Sky bet Championship with an away fixture at Blackburn's Ewood Park on Friday, August 9.
