A man from Sydney's northern beaches arranged online to meet a woman so he could have sex with her and her 13-year-old daughter, police allege.

They say sex crimes detectives were working undercover on an adult social networking site late last year when they discovered him in conversation with a woman and making sexually explicit and inappropriate comments.

It is alleged he arranged to meet the woman and her daughter so he could have sex with them both.
