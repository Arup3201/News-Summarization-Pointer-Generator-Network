Japanese tourists are travelling to Cheltenham for a more obscure attraction than Stonehenge, the famous steeplechase or the Cheltenham festival.

The tomb of a 'pig killer' has enticed an influx of Asian visitors to the historic Cotswold spa town.

The quaint grave of local butcher John Higgs, who died 187 years ago, is proving popular with visitors from Japan and the Far East eager to read the curious inscription.

In memory: The grave of John Higgs has proved popular and amusing as it reads 'Here lies John Higgs, A famous man for killing pigs'

Resting place of the 'pig killer': Local butcher John Higgs was buried in St Mary's Churchyard in Cheltenham in 1825. His grave is enticing an increased number of Japanese tourists to the town

It reads: ‘Here lies John Higgs, A famous man for killing pigs.

‘For killing pigs was his delight both morning, afternoon and night.’

Sue Adie, press and marketing officer for Cheltenham Tourism, said they were unsure why the grave has attracted Japanese tourists in particular.

She said: ‘It’s a bit of a mystery really.

‘Maybe it’s been written about in some Japanese guide books that we don’t know about.

‘Most people come to Cheltenham for the festivals of racing, literature, music and so on or for the architecture and the shopping but there are enquiries like this about the tomb that surprise us.

‘We often discover the reason is that a new tourist guide has been published in a particular country which prompts people to visit different attractions.’

The butcher, whose grave has attracted many English visitors as well, had a market stall in the town before he died in 1825, aged 55.

His grave lies in St Mary’s Churchyard. The church is Cheltenham’s oldest building, dating from the mid 11th century.

Local historian Roger Jones said the inscription had amused many.

He said: ‘The rhyme brings a smile to people’s faces and it seems to bring the past alive.

'We haven't been able to find out very much about John Higgs but he lives on through his grave.

The grave, which is also popular with British tourists, was restored last year.

Mr Jones said: ‘The engraving had been eroded and was very difficult to read, but after some much needed conservation work, you can just about make out the letters again.

‘You can learn a lot from a cemetery and you get some weird and wonderful gravestones. This particular grave has always fascinated people.’

The church is filled with at least 50 memorials including one to a women who was murdered by her servants, a blacksmith and a will writer.
