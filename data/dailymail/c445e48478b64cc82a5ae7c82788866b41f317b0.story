A history of violence and mental illness exists in the family of a woman who shot her three children and boyfriend before turning the gun on herself. 

Sara McMeen, 30, shot her children Skyler Lemke, eight, Ian Lemke, seven and ten-month-old Maggie Warren in the back yard of their home in Emington, Illinois. The body of her partner, 29-year-old Daniel Warren, was found inside the home last Friday.

It emerged today that McMeen's father shot his first wife dead more than 40 years ago in front of their two-year-old son. It happened before Sara McMeen was born.

Looking forward to Christmas: Ian Lemke, seven and his eight-year-old sister Skyler were shot by their mother Sara McMeen while playing in the back yard of their home in Emignton, Illinois

A happier time: Sarah McMeen, right, and Daniel Warren, left, cuttle their newborn baby Maggie. All three are now dead along with McMeen's two children from a previous relationship

A jury found Louis McMeen not guilty 
by reason of insanity in the 1971 killing of Pamela Bradley McMeen.

Sheriff's
officials say they may never know Sara McMeen's state of mind before 
the killings but the mother of Mr Warren said she had suffered from 
bi-polar disorder.

Authorities were waiting until the funerals of the family have taken place before questioning relatives and friends.

The four victims will be buried 
today. Daniel and Maggie Warren will be laid to rest in Morris, Illinois while the
funeral of McMeen's children from a previous relationship, Skyler and Ian, 
will be held in Dwight.

Young family: Sara McMeen was said to have been suffering from bi-polar disorder but was not on any medication when she reportedly shot her ten-month old baby Maggie

Around 125 mourners attended the funeral of Sara McMeen in Dwight yesterday, saying that McMeen was a 'good person who lost her way', according to NBC Chicago. 

Pastor Roy Leve, who attended the 
funeral, said: 'The McMeen family are very faithful in their desire to 
love the Lord, and I'm just here to kind of support them in their loss.'

The mother of Daniel Warren said she 
saw McMeen just before the shooting and that she seemed happy, despite 
not being on any medication for the mood disorder.

Speaking to RadarOnline,Wendy Warren 
said: 'Sara and my grandbaby came by to see me just the day before it 
happened. She was happy and everything. She came to collect some clothes
that I had bought for baby Maggie.'

Mourners: A congregation of around 125 attended the funeral of Sara McMeen who took her own life last week in Illinois after killing her own family

Grief: Mourners leave the funeral home yesterday after a service for Sara McMeen who was described as a 'good girl' who lost her way

The ten-month-old infant McMeen 
shared with Mr Warren was shot at point-blank range in front of a 
horrified neighbour at their home in the tiny farm town, after police 
say she shot with Skylar Lemke, eight, and Ian Lemke, seven - from her 
relationship with ex-boyfriend Brad Lemke. She then turned the gun on 
herself.

Around 40 years ago, Miss McMeen's 
father Louis McMeen took his wife, from whom he had separated, to 
secluded woods in Streator, Illinois and shot her before driving 
to the police station with her body and his son on his lap.

Mr McMeen had been released from a psychiatric ward a month earlier and was 
returned to the custody of the state being unfit to stand trial, according
to the Chicago Tribune.There were no records of when he was released. 
He is now believed to be living in Dwight, according to the Pontiac 
Daily Leader.

Adored: McMeen cares for little Maggie right after she was born. It's unclear why the 30-year-old killed her family

Mrs Warren said Sara McMeen and her son had been dating on-and-off for five years.

'They had their issues and they’d 
fight but they’d get back together,' Mrs Warren said. 'They had bought 
rings but they weren’t married. They were working on their issues.'

She said her son had several guns in the home.

'There were three children in the 
house so he never kept the bullets the same place as the weapons and he 
always had them locked up,' Mrs Warren told Radar. 'He had always wanted
to be a cop but was happy working in security.'

Gruesome discovery: Daniel Warren was found inside the house while the bodies of the three children were lying in the back yard of the rented home

All killed: The young family had only moved to the tiny farming town of Emington six months ago

Brad Lemke earlier told the Chicago 
Tribune he was at a loss to explain why the 30-year-old mother-of-three 
might have annihilated her own family.

'I don't know, I have no idea,' he said.

Neighbour Annelise Fiedler said she 
heard gunshots on Friday afternoon and ran outside to see McMeen 
wrapping her ten-month-old daughter Maggie in a blanket on the ground in
the family's backyard.

Ms Fiedler, not realising what was happening, asked McMeen whether she was alright.

McMeen responded: 'No, everything is not OK,' then bent down and shot the baby at point-blank range.

Tragic end: The schoolchildren in the family were said to be excited as they got off the bus because school was out for Chirstmas

Ms Fiedler said she ran for help. 
When she returned McMeen was dead, having apparently turned the 
semi-automatic pistol on herself.

The gunshots Ms Fiedler heard were likely the sounds of McMeen gunning down Mr Warren and her son Ian inside the house. In the backyard, she killed Skyler before taking the life of her infant.

Ms Fiedler said she had heard her 
next door neighbours fighting at least three times since they moved in 
this summer. But they otherwise kept to themselves.

The two school children, on the other hand, were well-known in the town of 120 people. Neighbours reported seeing them playing in the backyard and nearby park often.

McMeen's mother Cynthia, who is a 
school bus driver in a town 12 miles north of Emington, issued a 
statement asking for privacy as the family copes with the deaths:

'The family grieves over the loss of 
their loved ones. They realize this (tragic) incident affects not only 
their family, but other families as well. The family is drawing together
during this time, relying on God, and grieving. They would ask for your
prayers for all the families involved and would like their privacy to 
be honoured.'

Skyler and Ian Lemke, the two older children, were seen getting off a school bus an hour before they were murdered.

Tiny town: Emington, Illinois, is a farm down with a population of just 100. Residents say they have never seen anything like this before

'They were happy because it was the last day of school before Christmas break,' neighbour Ronald Groetsema said.

Neighbours reported seeing the school children playing in the backyard moments before they were gunned down.

The family had moved to the town of 
about 100 people about 80 miles southwest of Chicago this summer and the
two older children attend school in nearby Saunemin.

Livingston County Sheriff Martin 
Meredith said first responders found the bodies after Livingston County 
dispatchers received a call on Friday afternoon.

Ronald Groetsema lives near the home 
where the family was found and said he heard six to eight gunshots, then
heard a second round of four to six shots a few minutes later.

Mr Groetsema's 12-year-old son got off the school bus with the children who died, he said. Residents described Emington as a 
once strictly farming town that has gone through changes in the last 20 
years as young families moved in.

Young said the town has become more 
of a bedroom community from which people commute north to cities such as
Joliet, about 45 miles away.

'We did have an awful disaster here,' said Emington Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years.

'You never would have thought it 
would happen in our town of 100 people or less. It's very sad. There 
were helicopters flying over earlier. Right now it's just very, very, 
very sad for us here.'

Mayor Delaney said the town is not prosperous and has received help from the state.

'It's always really had a hard time. Most of the people are retired or farmers who moved into town,' he said.

Emington has a post office that's 
been targeted for closure and just a handful of small businesses - a 
grain elevator, a dog groomer and a small beauty salon.

The town, Livingston County Board member Bob Young said, had never experienced anything like Friday's shootings.

'I've lived here all my life. I 
guess, 60, 70 years ago we had a bank robbery, was the other big thing, 
but otherwise, nothing like this,' he said. Young said he did not know the family well.

'We've seen the kids playing at the playground and talk to them,' Mr Young said. 'We thought everything was fine.'

McMeen was one of nine children. Mrs Warren said she had spoken to McMeen's family, and that they were all consoling each other.
