Sir David Nicholson will celebrate his departure from the NHS with a £12,000 leaving do, it was reported today

The outgoing chief executive of NHS England is planning to celebrate his departure with a £12,000 leaving do, it was reported today.

Sir David Nicholson - dubbed the Man With No Shame after he refused to resign over the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal - is said to have organised a drinks party and dinner in central London next week.

Around 70 NHS executives and friends of the civil servant, including NHS England board directors Sir Bruce Keogh and Jane Cumnings, are expected to attend the lavish, £180-a-head, party on Monday.

They will first enjoy drinks and canapes at St Thomas' Hospital on the banks of the River Thames, before sitting down to dinner at the walkways at Tower Bridge, which cost £12,000 to hire, according to the Sun, although the party is not believed to be funded by the taxpayer.

Sir David, a former member of the communist party, is to leave his £210,000-a-year job next month with a £110,000-a-year pension after the party, which is said to be a celebration of his 'service to the NHS'.

Today whistleblower Julie Bailey, who exposed the neglect at Stafford Hospital after her mother, Bella, died there in appalling conditions, said: 'David Nicholson has no reason to celebrate.

'He presided over the biggest disaster in the history of the NHS, the Mid-Staffs scandal, as well as the Keogh review, 11 hospitals being put into special measures, the Morecambe Bay baby deaths, the 111 disaster, the care data fiasco, and gagging orders, which we had never heard of before his watch, among others.

'He should be apologising not only to relatives of those involved in the Mid-Staffs scandal, but also to every patient whose care suffered due to the NHS because of his lack of leadership.

'It would be better if he just went quickly and let a leader who cares for the staff and patients of the NHS take over.'

Campaigners called for Sir David to be 
sacked or resign after the publication of the public inquiry report into
 Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where up to 1,200 patients needlessly died.

He was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for the trust for a period while patients were being mistreated.

Yesterday Sir David spoke of his 'bitter
 regret' over not speaking to patients and their families who were so 
badly treated during the Stafford Hospital scandal.

He admitted his response to the Mid Stafforshire report – which revealed serious and systematic failures in care - had been one of the hardest lessons he learned during his 36-year career with the NHS.

Sir David said not talking to campaigners and other patients was his 'biggest mistake' of his service.

He said he avoided speaking to those affected because he did not want to be embroiled in a media circus - something he now says was the 'wrong call'.

The chief executive told delegates at the Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester: 'The biggest and most obvious mistake that I made was when it became clear when the Health Care Commission reported on Mid Staffordshire.

'I went to the hospital and I didn't seek out the patients representatives and the people who were in Cure The NHS, and I didn't do it because I made the wrong call.

Neither Sir David nor the NHS responded to calls from MailOnline this morning.
