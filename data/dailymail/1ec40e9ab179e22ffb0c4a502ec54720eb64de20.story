CSKA Moscow may have been forced to play their recent clash with Bayern Munich behind closed doors, but that didn't stop a group of German fans from attending.

The Bayern supporters rented a room in a tower block overlooking the Arena Khimki, giving them a bird's-eye view of proceedings. 

The game was played without fans as punishment for the racist chants and banners of CSKA supporters against Viktoria Plzen last December.

Thomas Muller scores the only goal of the game, a penalty in front of the empty stands 

Fan troubles have plagued the Russian club in European competition. Yaya Toure complained he had been the victim of racial abuse while playing them last season and in their match against Roma last month their supporters were involved in numerous incidents with the local police.

But Pep Guardiola's side were unperturbed by the vacant stands and have now won successive Champions League group games with a 1-0 scoreline. Thomas Muller's penalty was enough to seal the win in the Russian capital.

With no noise from the crowd, Guardiola could actually be heard calling for Polish striker Robert Lewandowski to take the spot kick, but Muller took it upon himself to but the German's in front. 

Bayern are now top of Group E with Italian side Roma in second place after their 1-1 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad.
