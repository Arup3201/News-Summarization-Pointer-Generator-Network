Huge roars greeted the Germans, with 'Oles' roaring around the stadium for any sustained passing sequence by Joachim Low's side.

Argentina were met with whistles and jeers and all around Rio there has been one refrain from the locals: 'Anyone but Argentina.'

On twitter, #todossomosalemanhes or 'we're all German' was trending in Brazil and Martin Demichelis complained that the team had been kept awake by fireworks until 4am.

It seems some Brazilians would do anything rather than let this World Cup finish in a further humiliation.

The Brazilians did at least respect the Argentine national anthem - which is more than they did for the Chileans in the last 16.

There are no issues with who sings the Argentine anthem or not - FIFA limit anthem time to a minute and their anthem is so long, it doesn't even reach the words within that allotted time.

It doesn't stop the fans singing along - in a dum-de-dum manner - and bouncing up and down the jauntier sections.

The invasion has been truly overwhelming. All Saturday tens of thousands Argentines poured into Rio, the majority without tickets.

The queues for the Copacabana Fan Park was a few thousand strong hours before its opening and trains en route to The Maracana were literally rocking as Argentines - from gnarled old hooligan leaders to 12-year-old girls with flowers in their hair - running through their extensive repertoire of provocative songs as they bounced up and down, punching the walls with the equilibrium of the trains in constant jeopardy.

There were less Argentines in the stadium at the final than at any other of their previous games, due to the scarcity of tickets.

That said, there were enough to run through their usual chants, most of which were laughing at their Brazilians hosts. Encouragingly England aren't yet considered a total irrelevance.

The old favourite 'Whoever doesn't jump is an Englishman' has received numerous outings here.

The list of VIP guests for the final was impressive, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff along with supermodel Gisele Bundchen, Rihanna, Shakira, David Beckham, Zico and Kaka.

Which only made it more perplexing that Olivier Dacourt was also included on the list of VIPs. Clearly his time at Everton and Leeds made an impression on Sepp Blatter.

The closing ceremony was a kaleidoscope of colour, with samba bands, carnival queens and Shakira and Wyclef Jean performing.

Wyclef had begun his press conference 'with a big shout out to my people in the favelas'.

Which was nice, though his 'people' might have wanted to ask why he was performing for FIFA, the organisation jointly responsible for Brazil spending billions of pounds on useless football stadia rather than electricity and sanitation in the favelas.

There was no sign of any protest near the stadium - largely because key leaders involved in the demonstrations against the World Cup were arrested the night before the final.

In moves which their lawyers described as clear human rights abuses, police swooped on their address and detained them during the final.

The police said that the detained leaders had been involved in violent protests in the past.

Bastian Schweinsteiger was the epitome of coolness and calm in the build up to the final and the Germans have been delightful and humble throughout the tournament.

Schweinsteiger even tweeted a photo playing basketball in a Brazil shirt before the final, thanking the host for their hospitality. (Though he neglected to add: ‘Especially for the semi-final debacle).

For the final though, Schweingsteiger had reasserted an air of authority and some might say arrogance.

His boots bore the inscription: ‘The Chosen One.’ Which made him sounds like someone in The Matrix. Or The Lego Movie.
