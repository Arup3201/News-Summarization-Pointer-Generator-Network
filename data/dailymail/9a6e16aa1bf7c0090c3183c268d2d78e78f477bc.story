Giovanni Simeone wants to be known for his skills and not as the son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone after impressing in a two-goal performance for Argentina's Under 20 side.

Argentina crushed Ecuador 5-2 in their opening match of the South American Under 20 championship in Uruguay on Wednesday with striker Simeone helping himself to a brace.

'I had a hard time trying to make my team mates understand I'm not a different (type of) person, I haven't come here because I'm the son of (someone famous),' the Madrid-born 19-year-old told the Argentine site Ole.

'I'm trying to show my skills and personality,' added Simeone, who has already had first division experience with River Plate, where he made his league debut in August 2013.

Argentina are looking to qualify for the world under-20 championship they have won a record six times.

The top four teams in the tournament that ends on Feb. 7 will go through to the May 30-June 20 world championship in New Zealand.

The winners will also qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, unless hosts Brazil are champions, in which case the runners-up will go through with them.
