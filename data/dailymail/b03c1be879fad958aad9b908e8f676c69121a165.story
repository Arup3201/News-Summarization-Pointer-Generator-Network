Rabbits braved a chilly start in Cambridgeshire this morning and starlings looked to be flying south for the winter in Scotland as much of the UK woke up to a blanket of frost this morning.

These beautiful pictures show how a cold snap overnight turned the countryside white with temperatures turning bitterly cold.

But despite the chill, autumn hasn't yet said a final farewell with water parting beautiful autumn leaves at Sourmilk Gill in Cumbria.

And forecasters predict a fine outlook for the rest of the day.

Large sections of the country will bask 
in glorious sunshine today, with Met Office forecasters predicting clear
skies, but don't be fooled by the sun as temperatures will remain 
chilly.

Much of the country can expect similar scenes tomorrow morning with 
temperatures expected to drop as low as 1C in urban areas overnight and below 
freezing in rural areas.

Isolated
showers are forecast in coastal areas in the west and in northern 
Scotland, but elsewhere it should remain dry and bright with 
temperatures peaking at 11C in some areas.

Clear skies will ensure that the temperature will drop quickly this evening particularly in central and eastern areas.

By dawn tomorrow south west England, 
western Scotland and Northern Ireland will see some rain in something of
an east west divide, with showers likely to be heavy in north westerly 
areas.

Through the day showers will gradually move eastwards and a southwesterly wind will increase.

Temperatures are likely to stay between 7C and 12C with some southern spots hitting 13C.

Tuesday could see heavy outbreaks of rain across Northern Ireland and some parts of Scotland. Elsewhere, there will be bright spells though it will be fairly breezy.

Temperatures will be similar to tomorrow.

The Met Office say that it will turn milder as the week goes on, but turn gloomier.

Meanwhile, autumn made a late appearance in Hillsea, Hampshire, this morning with beautiful clear skies and autumnal colours reflected in the crystal waters.

Much of the UK woke up to frosty scenes like this this morning. Today is expected to be a fine but chilly day
