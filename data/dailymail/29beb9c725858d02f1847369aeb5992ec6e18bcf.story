A weekend fight allegedly involving nearly every member of the Sarah Palin's family was actually started by her daughter' ex-boyfriend, according to a source close to the family.

It had been reported that the drunken brawl erupted when the Palin pack apparently had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20, on Saturday night in South Anchorage, Alaska.

But a source from the Palin side is now claiming it began when Cleary 'tried to get in' to the Hummer limousine after he had engaged in some unspecified 'questionable behavior.'

The former vice-presidential candidate has not commented publicly on the episode, but RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. 

The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him.'

That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his fiftieth that night, although it was not his party- became involved.

Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, "You know who we are, don’t you?"'

But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!'

Her son Track served with the U.S. Army service in the Iraq War.

According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose.

Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. 

She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.'

But the source said that Bristol is left-handed.

One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. 

Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend.

The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 

'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News.

'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence.

'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made.

'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.'

Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office.
