Authorities say the last one of the 13 teenagers who escaped from a youth detention center in Nashville is back in custody.

Metropolitan Nashville Police say the 16-year-old Timothy B. Willis was located early Sunday by an officer on patrol.

The Tennessee Department of Children's Services says in a statement that Willis and 12 other teens overpowered a guard late Friday, taking his keys to open a door at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center.

Timothy B. Willis, a 16-year-old with a record including charges for theft, assault, and being a runaway, was busted Sunday a little more than one day after escaping a youth detention center

According to the Tennessean, one managed to squeeze out through an opening between the rolling gate and perimeter fence.

That boy was able to throw a rock through the guard house window on the opposite side, then open the gate and let the rest free.

The statement says police located all but Willis within hours.

The 12 youth back in custody were taken to a juvenile court detention center.

The breach was the third major disturbance reported in recent weeks at the center.

In that case, the teens escaped by kicking through the dorm walls and shimmying underneath a weak spot in the perimeter fence.

Two juveniles from a Sept. 1 escape remain at large.

Several of those who participated in this most recent attempt were also part of previous escapes.

Repeat offenders may be transferred to a new facility.

The state department of corrections may also transfer extra guards to the facility.

The facility generally houses teens with at least three felonies on their records, spokesman Rob Johnson told the Tennessean.

Officials say the boys tried to convince the facility's 52 other inmates to follow them out.

'We believe the students tried to get other youth to join in, but they refused,' a statement from authorities said.

Two of the 14 staff members working during the escape sustained minor injuries.

'Aside from calling for help on a radio, the guards have few methods to control the youth,' the statement read. 'They do not have weapons or pepper spray.'

Children's Services officials and police didn't immediately answer Associated Press calls for details Saturday.

The department said 52 other teens at Woodland Hills remained securely held.

Authorities are asking that anyone with information on the whereabouts of Willis call 862-8600.
