Michelle Obama has admitted that she is already tired of the bangs she first sported in January.

The First Lady said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight: 'Bangs are a day-by-day proposition. They're starting to grow out, get a little irritating.'

Still, she hasn't let her hairdo woes get her down. 'It's okay,' she said 
after her initial complaint. 'We'll be good.'

Hair regret: Michelle Obama has admitted she is already tiring of the bangs she first sported in January. 'They're starting to grow out, get a little irritating,' she told Entertainment Tonight

The first indication that her hairstyle 
was becoming a burden came about last weekend, when Malia, 14, was 
spotted adjusting her mother's hair during the White House Easter Egg 
Roll.

The high school freshman gently smoothed her mother's hair for the cameras, then leaned in to kiss her on the cheek.

Mrs Obama's new haircut made headlines when it was first debuted in January, even managing to overshadow the President's inauguration weekend.

He jokingly announced at the start of the festivities: 'To address the most significant event of the weekend, I love her bangs.'

'The bangs are fun but you know, I'm like a girl, what's next?'

The hairstyle became such a talking point that one fan even created a Twitter account called MichellesBangs.

But it appears what at first was a 
novelty has turned into a burden for the First Lady, who has grown tired
of her high-maintenance hairstyle.

'It's fun but you know, I'm like a girl, what's next?' she said to the interviewer.

While her husband has been supportive throughout, not everybody been a fan of Mrs Obama's hair change; designer Karl Lagerfield, for example, famously described them as 'a bad idea.'

Not slowing down: The First Lady didn't let her bangs bother her as she planted the White House kitchen garden with school children yesterday, as part of her Let's Move initiative

But despite critics and the irritation it may cause, Mrs Obama hasn't let her hairdo slow her down.

Yesterday Mrs Obama joined school children
from across the country to plant a vegetable garden on the South Lawn 
of the White House, as part of her Let's Move initiative.

'My style is pretty easy and comfortable. Lots of good color and flowy fabrics for spring'

Her bangs looked perfectly styled as she crouched to plant and water the greens.

And despite her hair frustration, the First Lady told the ET interviewer she is looking forward to sporting floaty fabrics and skirts once spring finally rolls around.

'My style is pretty easy and comfortable,' she explained, noting that she is excited to be able to wear bright spring colors this season.
