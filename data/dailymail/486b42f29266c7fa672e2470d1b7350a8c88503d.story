Holiday nightmare: Paul and Xanta Watts, pictured on their wedding day, are suing after the bride fell ill on their honeymoon

A newly married couple are suing a four-star hotel after the bride fell violently ill and was hospitalised after contracting a serious infection while on their dream honeymoon in Asia. 

Paul, 36, and Xanta Watts, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, spent £10,000 on a three-week tour of Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand - where the bride started to feel unwell.

While staying at the four-star Paradise Koh Yao Resort Boutique Beach Resort & Spa on Koh Yao Noi Island near Phuket, Xanta, 29, suffered diarrhoea, vomiting and severe stomach cramps. 

She fell 
violently ill and was hospitalised for seven days after contracting 
Paratyphoid - a disease caused by the salmonella bacteria - diagnosed 
when she returned to the UK.

The
 couple claim they saw worm-like creatures in the swimming pools and 
fresh food being piled on top of old dishes at the luxury resort. 

The disease is commonly caused by eating contaminated food and water. 

The Watts are now taking legal action against the resort and tour operator Kuoni after their ‘honeymoon from hell’. 

Care worker Xanta, said: ‘We were devastated that our so called luxury holiday was completely ruined.

‘I couldn't believe that my dreams of a perfect start to my married life had been shattered by the illness we suffered.

‘I was still so ill when I got home that I was hospitalised and had to have a month off work.

‘We, our families and friends spent so long planning our perfect wedding and honeymoon. 

‘It therefore seems so unfair to think that our honeymoon is something we'd rather forget. 

‘Although we cannot turn back time and nothing can make up for what we suffered, we want answers over what caused our illness.

‘We experienced some horrible sights at the resort, such as seeing wormlike creatures in the pool on occasions during our stay, the food was undercooked on occasions, flies were often seen hovering around the fresh food, utensils were often being used for a number of dishes in the restaurant and fresh food was often piled on top of existing food rather than the trays being replaced.’

Amandeep 
Dhillon, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who is representing the couple, 
said: ‘Paul and Xanta feel that the standards which they experienced at 
this hotel, completely destroyed what was meant to be one of the most 
special and cherished experiences of their lives.

‘To spend part of your holiday, never mind your honeymoon, suffering such gastric symptoms is clearly disastrous.

‘We are currently carrying out investigations into the standards at the hotel following the reports from our clients. 

‘Paratyphoid is a type of salmonella. It is not an infection to be taken lightly and we are keen to determine its source.'

A spokesman for Kuoni said: 'We take any claims surrounding the health and well-being of our customers very seriously indeed and we are currently investigating this case.'
