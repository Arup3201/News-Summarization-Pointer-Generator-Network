The humiliated wife of serial sexter Anthony Weiner partly blames herself for his philandering ways, it emerged today.

Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, told People magazine that she began to beat herself up because Weiner returned to phone sex after they stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up more of her time.

However, after returning to counseling, she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media appearances.

While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claimed in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband.

'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine.

'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine.

'Any woman could have understood that.'

Indeed, Abedin and New York mayoral candidate Weiner let their friends know that their marriage might end.

Their friends let People Magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago.

'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.'

However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself.

He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.

However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son.

'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari.

'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?'

Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son.

'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine.

And, since it became clear she is not going to walk away from her marriage, Abedin has become distraught at the second guessing of her decision by friends - including the Clintons.

'No one wants to see Huma go through this,' said a source close to the Clintons.

'They are done with him. As part of caring about Huma, neither would shed a tear if he left the race and went away.'

Despite the public disapproval for remaining with Weiner, Abedin has vowed to continued to campaign by his side.

Seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place, Abedin is acutely aware that if she appears too forgiving it will add to her husband's problems, but if she disappears altogether, it will look worse.

'Every day that she alluded to his problems and said he's a better man and it's in the past, she was taking it too far,' a friend said. 'She knows that.'

'What worries me about her is this feeling that she has to be what everyone thinks she is. Some steely superhuman.'
