Talk about a dream home - because this one really did come straight out of the movies.

A house in in Herriman, Utah, modelled after the home featured in the animated movie ‘Up’, has been sold to a family who are self-described Disney and Pixar fanatics.

Clinton and Lynette Hamblin, of Petaluma, California, are buying the amazing 2,800 sq ft home near Salt Lake City for $400,000.

The Hamblins say they were searching for a home in California that was similar to the colourful cottage seen in the movie when they heard about the Disney-approved ‘Up’ house in Utah.

Builder Adam Bangerter has said the blueprints for the house were drawn based entirely on details found in the popular movie and much of the home had to be custom-designed.

The house has a stencilled front lawn post box, vibrant exterior paints and colourful murals inside that make it immediately recognisable to ‘Up’ fans.

Contractors matched the smallest of things from the garden hose reel to the front door, right down to the weather vane to those seen in the 2009 animated film.

The property was even painted with the identical multi-coloured pastel colour scheme, complete with white-picket fence and bright purple window frames.

But it is unclear whether the chimney comes equipped with large net of balloons for when the owner wants to make a handy escape or embark on overseas adventures.

The builders also installed a 'Paradise Falls' painting above the fireplace of the house, which features four bedrooms and three and a half baths.

The heart-warming film 'Up' follows the story of 79-year-old Carl Fredricksen.

Cartoon: The heart-warming film Up follows the story of 79-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who is at risk of losing his home because of local planned construction

He is at risk of losing his home because of local planned construction and so the elderly widower attaches balloons to his house to pull it from its foundations.

So Mr Fredricksen sets out to fulfil his lifelong dream to explore the wilds of South America.

Once airborne he discovers that he isn't alone and has a stowaway in the form of eight-year old boy scout Russell - who had visited his house trying to earn his 'assisting the elderly' merit badge.

The pair land in a place called Paradise Falls - which he had always dreamed of exploring - and begin their adventure involving a talking dog, an explorer and the battle for a flightless bird.
