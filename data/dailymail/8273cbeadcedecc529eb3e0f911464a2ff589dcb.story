A talented teenage jockey paralysed in a car crash just after completing her first competitive races is back in the saddle after being given pioneering treatment using a bionic leg.

Katie Watson, 19, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, broke her neck when her car aquaplaned on a puddle in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in February and flipped over. 

She spent five months in hospital and had daily physiotherapy, where she became one of the first people in the UK to use a bionic leg.

Miss Watson had just completed her first two competitive races when she broke her neck in an accident and was left bedridden 

The battery-powered device sits over the patient's own limb and responds to their desire to move, helping them learn to walk again.

Miss Watson is already able to walk unaided, started riding again a month ago and says she hopes to return to competitive racing soon.

She said: 'I was told by two different doctors and a consultant that I would never walk again, which was devastating to hear but I was determined to do whatever it took to get back on my feet,

'The Bionic Leg is amazing and has helped me so much. I would wear it every day for half an hour and its effects would carry over.

'At first I used a walking frame, two sticks, then one stick and now I can walk unaided. Four weeks ago I got back on a horse and I want to get back to race-riding again.' 

Miss Watson is currently living at Oaksey House in Lambourn, Berkshire, a rehabilitation centre funded by the Injured Jockeys Fund.

She was rushed to hospital (left) where she had to learn to walk again using a frame and walking sticks. The bionic leg fitted over her limb and responded to her desire to walk, assisting the recovery

The accident happened when she was driving back from visiting her boyfriend in Cheltenham to work in Lambourn.

She had been at the beginning of her promising career as a professional flat jockey, having competed in two rides.

AlterG, the company which make the electronic limb, claim it is the world's first bionic leg and say the device is designed to help patients after stroke, injury, orthopaedic surgery or traumatic brain injury. 

John Hammond, a clinical specialist for AlterG, said the bionic leg had recently launched in the UK.

Miss Watson began riding again a month ago and says she would like to get back to competitive racing as soon as she feels able

He said: 'The Bionic Leg is a crucial piece of equipment for stroke rehabilitation and therapy for patients with chronic, degenerative neurological gait impairment including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

'It's excellent that we can now offer the benefits that the Bionic Leg delivers to people in the UK.'

The device is claimed to help improve patient stance and strength, stability and gait while sensing their movements and only assisting when necessary.
