Arsene Wenger must dip his toe into the transfer market before the deadline passes if Arsenal want any chance of winning the Premier League title.

That's the view of Gary Neville, who believes the Gunners are set to lag behind Chelsea and Manchester City if they don't bring in another striker. 

Olivier Giroud is out until the end of December after breaking his leg away at Everton, with Alexis Sanchez leading the line in midweek against Besiktas.

Waving goodbye to good business? Arsene Wenger should sign a new striker in the coming days 

The Chilean cannot carry the weight of goalscoring on his own, however, and Wenger should move for a new frontman quickly.

'We thought even before Giroud got injured that Arsene Wenger would want to sign a top centre forward,' Neville told skysports.com.

'If we're judging them on getting third or fourth place, then Arsenal might not have a problem. But if we're judging them in terms of targeting a title, which I think is where Arsene Wenger and the Arsenal fans are at, then they're going to have to sign a centre forward – and probably a central midfield player as well.

'We're imagining Alexis as someone who is going to be played as a wide forward but he can play as a centre forward; he is tough and durable. But you think they are going to need somebody, unless he's going to put faith in Yaya Sanogo or Joel Campbell.'
