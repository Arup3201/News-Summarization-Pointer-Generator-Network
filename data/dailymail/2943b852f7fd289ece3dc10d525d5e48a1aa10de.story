Like most London clubs, it operated a strict dress code and admission was in a 'one in, one out' basis.Â 

There's just one thing not quite right about this exclusive nightspot - it's in a Tube carriage.

A group of pranksters set up a lively nightclub on the London Underground, complete with bouncers, pushy promoter and, of course, loud music.

The line's director said he didn't mind people having fun - but the event was held without permission.

The jokers transformed a carriage on the Northern Line, much to the amusement of fellow passengers, who were asked for ID, checked for drugs and told 'if you're name isn't down, you're not coming in.'

A video posted on YouTube on Saturday shows the carriage filled with ravers, some in fancy dress, dancing behind a roped off area of the train.

A man is then asked if he is carrying drugs, and 'searched' by a 'bouncer' armed with a torch.

'If it was up to me I'd let you in the club,' he tells the passenger filming the amusing sketch.

The man with the clipboard, playing the part of the doorman, adds: 'It's a party tonight, OK. If you wait one minute you can come in. It's one in, one out, OK?'

Passengers seem to be both baffled and amused by the episode - with some breaking out into laughter as they are invited into the party

The clip has been posted to YouTube where it has clocked up more than 45,000 views since Saturday.

Nigel Holness, Operations Director for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, said, 'This stunt was carried out without our permission.

'We obviously don't mind people having fun, but any event on our network needs to ensure it doesn't disrupt the service or put the safety of our passengers at risk.'
