Eurocrats are due to rubber-stamp the cultivation of the first genetically modified crop in nearly two decades, despite the opposition of 19 countries.

A new pest-resistant maize will be approved for commercial planting by the European Commission in the coming months.

It will be the first GM crop to be given the go-ahead since 1998, and only the second to be commercially grown in Europe.

Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health.

Yesterday the representatives of 19 governments tried to block the development in the EU General Affairs Council. But because of complex voting rules, it was not enough to stop the approval.

Now the application for commercial planting will go to the unelected European Commission, which is legally obliged to approve it.

David Lidington, Britain’s Europe Minister, voted in favour of the application - one of just five country representatives to do so. Four abstained.

Under EU rules each nation is given voting points depending on their population sizes. To block the application the representatives of roughly 75 per cent of European population needed to vote against - but only 52 per cent did so.

The British Government is fiercely in favour of GM food, despite strong consumer concerns. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said last month that Europe risked ‘becoming the museum of world farming’ if it continued to oppose GM technology.

Of the maize proposal, he said: ‘If approval is granted, as it should be based on the scientific evidence, then it will be the first GM food crop authorised for planting by the EU for 15 years.

‘Delays and blockages have been politically-motivated rather than based on evidence.’

The new crop - called Pioneer 1507 and developed by DuPont and Dow Chemical - is unlikely to be grown in Britain because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country.

European Health Commissioner Tonio Borg said extensive research had shown the crop, whose developers first applied for authorisation in 2001, was safe.

DuPont Pioneer said in a statement that the EU had ‘a legal obligation to itself, to its farmers and scientists and to its trade partners’ to support the approval of safe new agricultural products.

EU authorities have only ever approved two other GM crops for commercial cultivation - a different maize and a potato. The potato was later blocked by a court.

Campaigners last night said the European Commission should not approve the development - despite rules which oblige it to do so because not enough countries had voted to block it.

Greenpeace agriculture policy director Marco Contiero said: ‘The Commission cannot ignore the scientific, political and legal concerns voiced by a large majority of countries, by two thirds of the European Parliament and supported by most EU citizens.

‘The European Court of Justice would very likely overturn an authorisation of this GM maize in a legal challenge, as it did with the latest Commission approval of the Amflora GM potato.

‘The Commission must learn from its mistakes and stop breaching the rules that help ensure the safety of what is grown in Europe.’

Emma Hockridge, head of policy at organic campaign group the Soil Association, said: ‘Recent research by the EU’s own safety authority has shown that the GM maize poses a risk to certain species of butterflies and moths.

‘GM crops do not benefit farmers, consumers or the environment; only a handful of seed and chemical companies.’

Liz O’Neill, director of GM Freeze, said: ‘Pioneer 1507 maize is unnecessary and unwelcome. Despite 13 years in the application process, there are still too many unanswered questions about its impact on the natural environment and potential harm to human health.

‘Now that 19 European nations have given a clear signal that they do not want Pioneer 1507 grown on their doorstep, we sincerely hope that the European Commission upholds that view by rejecting DuPont’s application.’
