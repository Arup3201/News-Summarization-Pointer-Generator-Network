Men, if you're sat at your desk wishing you had a better job, you might want to look away now.

Just another day in the office: Russell James has been working as a Victoria's Secret photographer since 1997 and now he's released a book celebrating all the beautiful women he's shot such as Doutzen Kroes, pictured 

A quick flick through the 304-page coffee table tome will reveal the likes of Kendall Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Lily Aldridge, Candice Swanepoel and Alessandra Ambrosio in the nude. 

Russell, who has been the lingerie giant's chief photographer for 20 years, has worked on every single campaign and catalogue.

Job envy? The 304-page coffee table tome called Angels features the likes of Kendall Jenner, Lily Aldridge, Candice Swanepoel and Alessandra Ambrosio, pictured, in the nude

Lucky man: Russell has worked with the ladies for 20 years and says he is 'humbled and deeply grateful' for the opportunity 

So envied is 52-year-old Russell, that he was even asked to star on a TV show called Best Jobs Ever.

Aside from his Victoria's Secret duties, he has worked on numerous glossy magazine shoots and starred on America's Next Top Model and Australia's Next Top Model as a guest photographer or judge.

Speaking about his enviable gig, he said: 'For the past 20 years, I've had the good fortune to shoot the most beautiful women in the world, many of whom I met through my association with Victoria's Secret.

'To the women who appear here, and all those I've shot these many years, I want to say thank you for the privilege and, most importantly, your trust. I am humbled and deeply grateful.'

However, getting a sneak peek at some of the world's most beautiful women nearly nude doesn't come cheap; the book will set you back £125.
