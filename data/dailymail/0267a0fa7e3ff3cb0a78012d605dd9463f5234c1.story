An American Ebola survivor has donated blood to photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo as he fights for his life against the deadly virus. 

Dr Kent Brantly was on a road trip from Indiana to Texas when he was called by the Nebraska Medical Center asking him to donate plasma to help boost Mr Mukpo's immune system after their blood types were found to be a match. 

The doctor, who beat Ebola after being flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July,  raced to the nearest clinic in Kansas City, Missouri to donate. His blood is due to arrive in Omaha later on Wednesday to be used on Mr Mukpo.

Dr Kent Brantly was flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse. 

He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. 

As Mr Mukpo's condition worsened at Nebraska Medical Center, doctors decided to try a previous technique of a giving the patient a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor. 

Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease.

Dr Brantly had earlier donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease. 

Mr Mukpo's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, told NBC that the family were deeply touched by Dr Brantly's selfless actions.

Dr Levy told the network: 'This act of kindness and generosity makes me believe in the goodness of humanity.'

Mr Mukpo's girlfriend, Helen Finlay, said on Tuesday that it was heart-wrenching to watch her boyfriend on four years battle the deadly virus and be unable to get close to him

Parents of Ashoka Mukpo, Lady Diana Mukpo and Dr Mitchell Levy, said on Monday that they were relieved to have their son back in the U.S. to be treated for Ebola 

The girlfriend of Mr Mukpo described on Wednesday the torment of watching him battle the deadly virus - but be unable to get close to comfort him.

British-born Helen Finlay described the experience as 'heart-wrenching', adding: 'I mean when you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them you're going to be okay and be close to them and obviously you can't do that. It is a little bit hard.' 

Mr Mukpo, who was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC when he contracted the disease, is receiving the experimental drug Brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the virus. 

His symptoms have deteriorated since he arrived in the U.S. but he is still in the early stages of the disease, doctors said on Wednesday.

The drug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. It has never before been used on Ebola patients.

Dallas Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, a Liberian national, passed away from the disease on Wednesday morning. 

Mr Duncan, the first ever Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S., had also been receiving Brincidofovir.

Thomas Duncan passed away on Wednesday morning after contracting Ebola last month. He was receiving the experimental drug Brincidofovir
