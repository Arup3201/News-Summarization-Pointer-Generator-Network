The future of 25 Australian babies born to  parents who are asylum seekers is uncertain after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison retrospectively changed the legal status of some children born in detention.

Born in Australia from the 19 July 2013, the infants - who range from the age of one to just a few months old - are currently in detention centres in the country, where their families anxiously await their fate. 

Legislation passed by the government in parliament on Tuesday morning means the babies are now defined as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals (UMAs) because their asylum seeker parents arrived in Australia by boat.

The babies' lawyer Katie Robertson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Falling pregnant was the catalyst for many of these women to come to Australia... it was the final straw, they didn't want to impose what they'd suffered on their child.'

The future of 25 babies born in Australia to asylum seeker mothers is uncertain after a change in legislation

Lawyer Katie Robertson, who is representing the families on behalf of Maurice Blackburn’s social justice department, had been fighting for the right to apply for visas for the babies

The mothers of the babies, all classed to have high-risk pregnancies, gave birth in Australian immigration detention - watched over by security guards - because the medical conditions on the tiny Pacific Island of Nauru where they were originally being held were so poor.

Ms Robertson, who is representing the families on behalf of Maurice Blackburn’s social justice department, had been fighting for the right to apply for visas for the babies.

However, a change to the Bill announced by Mr Morrison on Tuesday means the babies now have little chance of being allowed to stay in the country in which they were born.

Ms Robertson said: 'These babies are born to the most vulnerable parents.

'The babies have never had a free day in their life... It’s so arbitrary and cruel'.

Speaking to New Matilda Ms Robertson also said: 'Clearly Morrison and his department agreed we had a good argument because they've now amended the law.’

Eight of the 25 babies are born to parents from Myanmar. Because of their Rohingya heritage the government does not recognise them as citizens.

One of the babies fighting to stay in Australia is a one-year-old Rohingya baby called Ferouz, who was born in Brisbane. He is now being sent to live on Nauru until his future is decided.

Ferouz was born prematurely in Australia after his mother was classed as a high-risk pregnancy. 

Ms Robertson said the families are ‘beside themselves with anxiety’. 

The legislation means put forward by Scott Morrison (pictured) the babies are now defined as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals (UMAs)

'One woman grew up in an refugee camp in Africa from the age of three. She came to Australia when she was pregnant and spent time in Nauru,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'She says she is tough but she does not want her child to go there as it is no place for children.

'If you can put yourself in their situation these families have fled persecution. They have been returned to Australia because they are the most vulnerable cases.' 

The changes came as part of a deal Mr Morrison made.

He argued that if the government would pass the Bill he would allow 108 children currently being held on Christmas Island with their parents to be granted Temporary Protection Visas rather than be deported to Nauru. 

Ms Robertson has a clear message for Mr Morrison, calling him out on the promise he broke when he vowed to allow children of asylum seekers to live in the community.

'We are calling on him to be true to his word. He made a clear promise that children in detention would be released into the community,' she said.

'We are not saying they should be able to stay, we are saying they should go through the same application process. If they are not found to be refugees, fair enough.’ 

Maurice Blackburn Senior Associate Murray Watt said: ‘Minister Morrison claims that his bill will release children from detention, when in fact it will do just the opposite.

‘While some children may be released and may become eligible to apply for Temporary Protection Visas, the bill also condemns 25 Australian-born babies to removal to Nauru.

‘Buried in the bill are amendments that retrospectively deem these babies to have come from Nauru, when they were born here and have never left Australia.’ 

The infants are now being classed as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals despite being born in Australia. This is the ID card of one of the babies

They could be sent to Nauru detention centre as early as Wednesday 

Mr Blackburn added: ‘We are urgently calling on Scott Morrison to amend his bill and let these babies stay in Australia – they were born in Australia and have spent their entire lives here, yet because their mothers spent time previously on Nauru they will now be taken away. 

‘That is grossly unfair, and it is not the Australian way.

'We also appeal to Senator Ricky Muir, who holds the deciding vote, to stand up for these Aussie kids and amend this bill.

‘Senator Muir has kids of his own, and I can’t imagine he would want to see other kids born in our country locked up indefinitely on Nauru.’ 

Ms Robertson argues the children have never left Australia and should at least have the right to apply to stay

In response to the 25 babies' imminent deportation, Christian Leaders around Australia held nationwide prayer sit-ins in seven MP's offices in six cities: Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide.

More than 50 church-goers were spread protested in Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's Perth office as well as Mr Morrison's office on Wednesday.

On Friday, Guardian Australia published photos from inside the family and single adult women camp - Regional Processing Centre 3 (RPC3) – were the women would have lived.

Christian action group Love Makes A Way organised a sit-in at Scott Morrison's office 

Church-goers also visited Julie Bishop's office in Perth 

The distressing images showed young children playing in dirt, covering from the sun under cardboard boxes, and clothes hanging on fences. 

There have long been concerns over the way asylum seekers are treated at Nauru and in October the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) visited RPC3 and expressed concerns that facilities there were in violation of international human rights laws 

In November 2013, a UNHCR report ruled the education room at the centre was ‘too hot for the children to remain in it for any length of time’ and highlighted ‘deteriorating mental health’ of children held there.

Members of the media are currently denied access to the detention centre on Nauru where there are already 106 asylum seeker children detained.

The UNHCR recommended the government should ‘cease to transfer children and their families to Nauru under current conditions’. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Immigration Minister Scott Morrison for comment. 

Many reports have slammed the conditions of the facilities saying they are no place for children or families
