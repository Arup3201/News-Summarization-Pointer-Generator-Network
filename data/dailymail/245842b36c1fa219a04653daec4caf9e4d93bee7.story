Wigan prop Ben Flower was sent off after just two minutes of Saturday's Grand Final for a shocking attack on St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia. 

Wales international Flower had spilled the ball with a try beckoning in the opening minute and seconds later he lost his head.

Flower appeared to take exception to stand-off Lance Hohaia's use of a forearm on him during a Wigan attack and reacted by knocking him to the ground with a left hook.

The former Crusaders forward then struck his defenceless opponent with a second punch to his face while he laid motionless on the turf. 

Referee Phil Bentham had no choice but to brandish a red card and Flower became the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final. 

St Helens went on to win the showpiece 14-6 thanks to second-half tries from Tommy Makinson and Sia Soliola.

For a time Flower was the top-trending topic on Twitter in the United Kingdom and he looks certain to be the talking point for some time to come. 

Hohaia was helped from the field badly dazed, only to return after the final hooter to help his team-mates celebrate their famous 14-6 victory.

A Rugby Football League spokesman said it would be up to Hohaia and St Helens to decide whether to pursue action outside the game's jurisdiction, otherwise the case would go as normal before the match-review panel on Monday.

Michael Owen and Joey Barton, both fans of the 13-man game, condemned the Wigan man, and former England rugby union hooker Brian Moore suggested the second punch thrown by Flower was 'unforgivable'.

QPR midfielder Barton suggested Flower and Hohaia should have resolved their differences 'over a gingerbread latte and a philosophy discussion'.

He wrote on Twitter that the punches Flower launched after two minutes of the Old Trafford showpiece were 'madness', before moderating his initial verdict.

'Actually feel a bit sorry for Ben Flower,' Barton wrote on Twitter. 'Lance started it with his elbow. Superb 1st dig from Flower. 2nd when he's KO'd is out of order.'

He added across a number of messages: 'In my eyes if you go round throwing digs and you get put a sleep, you get minimal sympathy. Its not draughts after all. £SuperLeague.

'I'm not sure why they didn't just sort it over a gingerbread latte and a philosophy discussion like I would have advocated... £SuperLeague

'I'm not defending Ben Flower at all. Just saying he did cop a beauty of an elbow right in the mush just before he threw the 1st dig.'

Owen, the former Liverpool and England striker, wrote: 'Can you imagine the outcry if a footballer did that?'

He added: 'Can sort of understand the first punch after being provoked but to hit someone again when they are already out cold is hard to understand.'

Moore, no stranger to physical combat at the heart of rugby union scrums, stressed Flower had overstepped the mark.

The 52-year-old wrote: 'Ben Flower - his first punch was retaliation for a cheap shot on him; second one was unforgiveable (sic).

'...to be absolutely correct his cheap shot on Ohaia led to Ohaia's cheap shot then Flower's retaliation & second punch on prone man.'
