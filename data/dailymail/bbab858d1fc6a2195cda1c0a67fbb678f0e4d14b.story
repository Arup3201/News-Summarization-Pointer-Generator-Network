A toy baby will cost American Sniper the Oscar, movie insiders predict.

Clint Eastwood's movie  picked up six Academy Award nominations and more at the box office than the other seven nominees combined.

But the scene which shows Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller cradling a doll was widely mocked.

Anticipating the outcome of this Sunday's ceremony, a panel of experts agreed that one prop is the movie's Achilles Heel.

Fatal flaw: This fake baby will prevent American Sniper from winning Best Picture, experts say 

In a scene where Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller discuss Chris' duty to the military, a fake was used

The panel assembled by Vanity Fair on Tuesday consisted of movie producer Jennifer Todd, Vanity Fair's Krista Smith, Allison Samuels of the Daily Beast, IndieWire's Anne Thompson, Pete Hammond of Deadline, Fandango's Dave Karger.

Best Picture, they say, will be between Boyhood and Birdman.

American Sniper would win if it were a public vote, a study showed.

But the biopic about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who claimed to have killed 255 people, will be snubbed by the upper echelons of Hollywood, the group agreed.

According to Pete Hammond, Eastwood had cast a baby but the child was ill on the day of shooting so he made the fatal error of substituting a plastic doll.  

The movie stoked heated debate over the morality of war - and the art of prop selection.

Feeding: Sienna Miller had the difficult task of playing Taya Kyle and breastfeeding the fake baby

The man on whom it is based, Chris Kyle, was shot and killed by a veteran before the movie was completed

On the same weekend American Sniper hit movie theaters, director Michael Moore tweeted: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

He later claimed that his words were incidental and not aimed at the movie. 

Seth Rogen also hit out at Eastwood's latest piece, likening it to a violent episode in Quentin Tarantino's Nazi-era movie Inglorious Basterds. 

But it was that baby that merited unabashed ridicule. 

The scene involves Cooper, as Chris Kyle, and Miller, as Taya Kyle, having a conversation about him leaving the family and returning to war.

Both parents hold their 'baby' daughter as they discuss whether soldiers or Chris' wife and children are more important.

A second instance of using a doll instead of a human occurs earlier in the film, when Chris and Taya welcome their baby son into the world.

Tough call: Because the babies cast in American Sniper were ill, Eastwood decided to use a doll instead

Nod: The panel of experts believe Julianne Moore can clear shelf space for her Best Actress Oscar already

Favorite: Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, is tipped as one of the two favorites to take Best Picture

Early reviews identified the scene as a major flaw for the Oscar contender.

On the website HitFix, for example, reviewer Drew McWeeny wrote, 'I get so distracted by the baby... the entire rest of the scene, that's all I can look at.'

'Neither one of them looks like they are comfortable holding it,' McWeeny continued, speaking on the actors. 'Cooper in particular looks like he's just plain never held a baby.'

'Hate to ruin the fun but real baby #1 showed up with a fever,' script writer Jason Hall tweeted in response to those questioning the choice to use a doll.

'Real baby #2 was no show. (Clint voice) Gimme the doll, kid,' Hall continued in a message published by The Hollywood Reporter. The original tweet has since been deleted.

Unanimously, the panel of experts said Patricia Arquette will take home Best Supporting Actress for Boyhood, JK Simmons the equivalent for Whiplash, and Julianne Moore will land the Best Actress award for Still Alice.

A Harvard senior and statistics whiz who uses a mathematical model to predict an Oscar nominees chance of winning - and has a 75 percent success rate from previous years - also gave the nod to Birdman for Best Picture. 

However, Matthew Belloni, executive editor of industry journal The Hollywood Reporter, told AFP: 'Boyhood and Birdman are the frontrunners, and American Sniper is the dark horse.'

According to other forecasters, it could be that the top contenders split best picture and best director, as 12 Years a Slave and Gravity did last year.

'It seems a lot of people are saying that if they vote Birdman in one of those two categories, they are going to vote Boyhood in the other,' said Paul Sheehan, editor at awards handicapper GoldDerby.com.

But because of the best picture category's preferential ballot, in which members rank their top films rather than vote for just one, a movie that is many people's second choice could prevail. 

For Sheehan, that's director Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel.
