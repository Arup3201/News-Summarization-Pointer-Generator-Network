Teachers at a secondary school have made a hilarious video parody of this year's biggest pop hits which has already had thousands of hits on YouTube - and they hope it will raise thousands for charity.

In the video teachers from Fair Oak Academy in Rugeley, Staffordshire, dress up as famous celebrities and singers, and attempt to replicate popular music videos from 2014 in order to raise money for charity in memory of Stephen Sutton.

The footage includes re-makes of the Pharrell Williams hit, 'Happy', the infamous Miley Cyrus 'Wrecking Ball' video, the original Band Aid recording and even the John Lewis Christmas advert.

The video was uploaded on Friday evening and has already received 2,500 views.

Fair Oak Academy is hoping it will go viral and help raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust in memory of Stephen Sutton, who died in May this year.

Mr Sutton's story attracted worldwide attention when the 19-year-old from Burntwood, Staffordshire, became a sensation for his upbeat attitude and refusal to give up after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Rachael Sandham, director of design at the school and producer of the video, said: 'For the past few years we have done one of these Christmas videos and they are so much fun for parents and pupils, as well as staff.

The video parodies this year's biggest  videos - including the Monty the Penguin advert from John Lewis

'For the previous videos we did struggle to get all the staff together but when we decided to do it in memory of Stephen they all rallied around and gave up their own time after school to help.

'A lady in our finance office has a daughter who was at the same school in the same year as Stephen so we had that connection to him.

'The video has given everyone such a morale boost.

'It has taken about three weeks to put together. By the time I finished filming we had about seven hours of footage to condense down to about seven minutes.

'I just really hope it raises awareness and money so we can give something back.

'My favourite bit is probably the wrecking ball clip. The teacher, Phil Yeomans, is such a character, and it took someone like him to pull off that outrageous scene.

'Principal Mr Powell is leaving after this term and he was such a good sport, he got very involved and it was a lot of fun.

'We plan to do it every year, and give one student a chance to appear in the video with the teachers.

'This time we had Cole Parker get involved as a reward for his exceptional performance this year. He stars as the little boy in our version of the John Lewis advert with the penguin.'

The video starts by showing school principal David Powell sitting in his office watching Christmas videos on the TV while helping himself to several glasses of mulled wine.

As he changes channel, different scenes are re-created  as parodies of this year's most popular songs.

The first is a re-make of this year's John Lewis Christmas advert, with a human-sized penguin co-starring with 11-year-old pupil, Cole.

Then after a channel switch Mr Yeomans, performs an exuberant interpretation of Miley Cyrus's 'Wrecking Ball' video.

Next, several teachers mime into a microphone to parody the Band Aid music video from the 1980s, while  'Do They Know It's Christmas?' plays in the background.

After that, a rendition of 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams is filmed around the school campus.

Then finally, staff dress up in ballet costumes and gangster gear to poke fun at the Taylor Swift music video for 'Shake It Off'.

The footage ends with a cleaner coming into Mr Powell's office, where he has fallen asleep having finished off his bottle of mulled wine.

Miss Sandham added: 'The staff were so supportive and the Sutton family have given it their blessing.

'We were so happy to do it in memory of Stephen because his is such an amazing story, it is hard to imagine what he went through and yet he never gave up.

'We did it so we are able to show the pupils the importance of never giving up and what they are able to do when they put their minds to something.'

Fair Oak Academy is a senior school which caters for 832 boys and girls from the age of 11 to 18, and received a rating of 'Good' at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013.

Mr Powell, who retired on Friday after two years in charge at the academy said: 'It was brilliant and it was for a good cause.

'It's not normal for a principal to dress up in a tutu but I thought I might as well since I was retiring.

'I didn't enjoy the costumes at all but it was all for the greater good. 

'I think I sacrificed most of my integrity but it was for a good cause.'

The video also sees a number of teachers performing the dancing continuous shot from Pharell's 'Happy'
