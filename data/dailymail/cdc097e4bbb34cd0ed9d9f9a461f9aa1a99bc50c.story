A relaxing day scuba diving soon turned into a scene from the film Jaws for two divers  when a Great White shark appeared from nowhere and left them scrambling desperately to get out of the water.

Adelaide University Scuba Club divers Mark Sutcliffe and Jan Busch got up close and personal with the Great White at the Glenelg tyre reef last weekend.

The Advertiser reported that the divers encountered the “largest fish” they had ever seen on Sunday. They could only watch in horror as the shark circled the pair three times before disappearing into the blue.

In a post to the club’s Facebook page, Sutcliffe made the understatement of the month by describing it as an 'interesting dive'.

'Well done Jan Busch for snapping these shots while I had half my body inside a tyre tetrahedron and breathing my ass off,' he wrote.

'We waited until it cleared off before exiting the water. Omitted the safety stop on the way up!'

Adelaide University Scuba Club president Gail Jackman however, was not so light-hearted about the close encounter of the man-eating kind, and said the club would review its safety policies in light of what happened.

Jackman said the policy of each boat having a shark shield attached to its anchor line may change to ensure that each group of divers now had a shark shield with them underwater in the future as well.

'Sharks are always there – that’s the risk you take as a scuba diver,' Jackman said.

'Safety is the most important thing.'

Shark sightings are common at this time of year along the metropolitan coast line.
