Dennis Whitfield, 66, was a tutor for 37 years but at the same time was conning his pupils out of cash

A driving instructor dubbed 'the Doc' because of his resemblance to the Back To The Future character has been jailed for conning pupils in a £250,000 investment scam. 

Dennis Whitfield, 66, who was a tutor for 37 years, was given his nickname because he looked like Doc Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in the Back to the Future movies.

However, beneath his honest church-going persona, Whitfield was secretly pocketing nearly £250,000 by exploiting his job with the British School of Motoring to fool learner drivers into parting with extra cash. 

He spent 20 years giving his girlfriend lessons yet never put her in for a test. 

Over that time Dennis Whitfield conned the woman out of £206,000 - telling her he had a pharmaceuticals investment scheme and high interest bank account she should move her money into.

When her savings ran out he persuaded her to take out loans for the scheme.

He swindled a further £31,000 from other driving school pupils - saying he could get cheap second-hand cars for them.

In fact it was all lies, but Whitfield - who pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and two of theft - refused to explain where any of the cash went, simply telling police he is ‘silly with money’.

Whitfield, 66, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was jailed for three years and four months, as Bolton Crown Court heard he has left his former girlfriend penniless and in debt.

Whitfield had won her trust after first becoming friends with her sister - who he also conned out of £20,000.

He invented a fictitious ‘professor’ working on pioneering medicine and persuaded both women to invest in what they thought was a pharmaceuticals firm.

He even gave the family what he said were pills created there - but they were just vitamins.

Seven driving school pupils were duped out of between £1,700 and £4,200 each after Whitfield said he could get cheap, second-hand Vauxhall Corsas for them.

Each victim handed over cash only to never hear from Whitfield again.

The court heard he won the trust of all his victims by talking about his regular church-going and long-standing employment with BSM, formerly the British School of Motoring.

Whitfield, who was convicted of another almost identical fraud last year, was said to be ‘ashamed’ of the offences, which occurred between 1995 to 2013.

Sentencing Whitfield, judge Recorder Ray Herman told him: 'As a result [of your offences] you left [this woman] in terrible difficulties and she is obliged to pay interest on these loans she raised and has had no money returned by you.

'Some of your victims were vulnerable adults, particularly [this woman].

'You told her you loved her and persuaded her to have driving lessons with you for 20 years.'
