1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 238 points

2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 216 points

3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 166 points

The notion that Lewis Hamilton did not win the Italian Grand Prix fair and square is about as believable as Elvis faking his own death. Both can be found in the file under ‘f’ for far-fetched.

The incident that turned the race in Hamilton’s favour was when he was pursuing Rosberg along the start straight at 220mph. The German seemingly cracked, ran straight on at the chicane and surrendered the lead.

The TV camera caught Mercedes boss Toto Wolff smiling on the pit wall. The cynics took this as a sign that he had ordered Rosberg to give way to make up for having crashed into Hamilton in the previous race in Spa, and was delighted to see the crafty plan carried out so adroitly.

Sir Jackie Stewart, the three-time world champion, was not convinced. ‘There was very little rubber smoke. I don’t quite understand why it happened on a very easy part of the track. I thought it was a bit too easy. He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’

Fuel to the conspiracy fire is that Rosberg made the same mistake at the same point earlier in the race. Barring Daniil Kvyat’s brake failure, no other driver missed the chicane all race.

Stewart added: ‘The first time I thought “that’s wise”; the second time I thought: “hello, what’s going on here?”’

Formula One is not totally unused to such things. The 2008 Singapore Grand Prix was fixed by Renault asking Nelson Piquet Jnr to crash to let Fernando Alonso win. But Piquet was a desperate man seeking a new contract. Rosberg is fighting for the world drivers’ championship.

‘I just messed up,’ said the German. ‘What would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately? There is no possible reason.

‘If you’re ordered by the team to do it then you would do it, but there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position, or something like that.

‘The only thing in people’s minds could be Spa, but Spa was a mistake I’ve apologised for.

‘It’s not like we are now starting to shuffling our cars.’

Wolff was even more emphatic, saying: ‘Only a paranoid mind would have dreamed up such an idea.’ Indeed, why go to such lengths to fix the result when there are so many easier ways of doing it? They could have issued an order over the radio or fumbled a pit stop?

In the total absence of evidence of a foul play, I would rather give credit to Hamilton for the stridency of his driving that forced the mistake from the usually unflappable Rosberg.

Hamilton’s victory – his sixth of the season – was achieved despite an awful start that took him from pole to fourth position by the first corner after a technical problem with his launch setting.

He recovered manfully, even seizing the initiative to charge at Rosberg there and then despite the advice from the pit wall to sit back and conserve his tyres for the end of the race. His sense of adventure, shrewd tactical judgment, meant he was on Rosberg’s tail by 29th and pivotal lap.

Rosberg went off when Lewis was just over a second behind him. Hamilton was untroubled all afternoon. 

Rosberg came home second, his lead trimmed to 22 points with six races remaining.

Finally, Hamilton had had some luck in a season that has tripped him up at every turn. Watching slightly fretfully, as is his wont, was Lewis’s father Anthony and his step-mother Linda. Anthony’s verdict was both blunt and encouraging.

‘Lewis drove the way he knows best and that is what he needs to do from now on,’ he said. ‘He can catch up in this championship. It is just head down and drive like he did in go-karts – to win. Drive to win, no other way.

‘What has happened to Lewis in the past few weeks has been unreal. Sometimes things go well and then they go badly. 

It is down to the strength of character of the driver to keep plugging away and be honest about hard it is. It is not about engines or anything, it is about getting out there and doing your job.

‘It is all character building but it is extraordinary – and that is why I am feeling this extra special something, that this championship is about giving Lewis such a hard time but he comes through it. We just have to keep the faith.’

Away from Mercedes, there was a minor disaster for Ferrari. Fernando Alonso was non-classified for the first time in five years when his battery pack gave up on him. Kimi Raikkonen scored a mere two points.

It was hardly what the throng who made their traditional post-race pilgrimage along the start straight wanted. 

But there were many others – Union Jack-waving British fans – among the tifosi got the winner they craved. Some of them again, regrettably, booed Rosberg for his Spa mistake.

Hamilton was cheered loudly. He had finally secured a psychological blow, one that will mean far more to him if, as seems likely, it was earned fairly.
