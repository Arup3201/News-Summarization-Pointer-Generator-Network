A murderer walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits, obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday.

The disappearance of Hell’s Angel David Richards, 53, should have triggered a  manhunt after he absconded from a Derbyshire open prison in 2005.

But local police refused to look for him, leaving him free to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society.

Murder victim: Michael Groves, left, with his younger brother Marcus. David Richards and his girlfriend attacked Michael with a wrench, hammer and knife before writing 'Hell's Angels' on the wall with his blood

He rented a flat, claimed thousands in benefits, went to Ireland on holiday and even complained to police that youths had been throwing stones at his window.

Richards was only recaptured after the Daily Mail was tipped off about him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act.

Last night, his victim’s shocked family demanded an urgent inquiry into the farce, which raises serious questions about measures to manage dangerous offenders.

Louise Bull, 42, whose 16-year-old brother, Michael Groves, was murdered by Richards, said those responsible for the ‘disgraceful failings’ should be named. She added: ‘My family were fobbed off again and again. We deserve to know what went wrong so it can never happen again.’

Richards was jailed for life with his girlfriend in 1984 for Michael’s frenzied, drug-fuelled murder at their West London flat.

They attacked him with a knife, hammer and wrench, leaving him with 56 injuries. They then wrote ‘Hell’s Angels’ on the wall in his blood. Richards was sentenced to at least 16 years, but was deemed so dangerous that he was still in prison in 2005 – 21 years later.

However, just months before his release, he walked out of Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, because he was stressed and fed up with being bullied, according to his parents.

Instead of mounting a manhunt, Derbyshire Police merely logged his disappearance on a national database. It took no further action, even after being contacted by the Daily Mail.

Instead it was left to the Met Police, which dealt with the original murder, to travel to Wolverhampton and arrest Richards. Detectives discovered the former Hell’s Angel in a flat near his parents, where the keen odd-jobber was known for helping neighbours.

Richards had been able to register for disability and housing benefits, claiming he was unable to work because he has difficulty walking. His mother Patricia, 79, said: ‘As far as we were concerned, he was a free man.

‘He never hid from anyone and was even claiming disability benefits. He’s got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a stick.

‘He can’t work but he’s so helpful to everyone and he’s just a lovely, kind man. It’s ridiculous that he has been arrested after so much time. He only had a few months to serve. We thought he was free because no one came for him.

‘He’s had a passport for heaven’s sake, so he’s not exactly been lying low.’

Absconded: Just months before his release, Richards walked out of Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, because he was stressed and fed up with being bullied, according to his parents

Mrs Bull, a nurse from Fareham, Hampshire, said she was stonewalled by police when she asked what was being done to find him. In 2005, a police family liaison officer even refused to tell her which prison he walked out of because of the killer’s ‘right to privacy’.

She said: ‘I’m ecstatic he’s been caught. Now I want him to serve the time he should’ve served in the first place.

‘People need to explain how this can possibly have been able to happen and those responsible for doing nothing need to be named.

‘My family got the real life sentence. He took everything away from us and we miss my brother at every special event, every family occasion. I have spent the last nine years full of anger and living in fear.’

A Met spokesman said Richards was arrested on Friday and remains in custody at a West Midlands police station.

He said: ‘On Monday, June 2, the Met was contacted by the Daily Mail regarding Richards who was wanted by police having absconded from HMP Sudbury. As a result, officers attended an address in the West Midlands where Richards was subsequently arrested.’

His capture follows the disappearance of an armed robber known as the Skull Cracker, which ignited a row about open prisons. Michael Wheatley, 55, walked out of a Kent jail last month, holding up a building society in Surrey before being caught.

Ministers said inmates should no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed on temporary release if they had absconded before.
