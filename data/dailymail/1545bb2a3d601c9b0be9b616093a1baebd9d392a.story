Four years ago, Greece was hit by one of the worst economic crisis in history with concerns about social unrest and the country's possible departure from the eurozone keeping holidaymakers away.

With tourism being the country's biggest industry, the country seriously suffered, but the mood here is changing. Tourism will be up 20 per cent next year and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010.

And now, luxury hotels are opening their doors down south to draw in the kind of crowds you'd see splashing the cash in Monaco in a high-end revamp they hope will inject some serious glamour into the country.

Back in business: Tourism will be up 20 per cent next year in Greece and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010 with hoteliers hoping to redefine the south as the Greek Riviera 

'We want to transform the South Coast into the Greek Riviera,' says a local taxi driver, who had been out of work for eight months before securing a job as one of the new hotel's private drivers.

'We want this area to be a luxurious haven of choice for the world's jet set, VIP and celebrity clientele,' he adds. And they're not off to a bad start. 

Nikki Beach, a global beach club brand, has opened  in Porto Heli, a picturesque fishing village a few hours from Athens.

You may not have heard of Porto Heli but that's kind of its appeal. The eastern Peloponnese region is a favourite among Athenian weekenders, royals, footballers and Greek shipping heirs, who use the remote location as a relaxing getaway, making it the perfect home for the newest addition to the Nikki Beach family.

Room with a view: Each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the Agean waters and a 'floating bed'

Nikki Beach was the brainchild of Jack Penrod, who became the largest McDonald's franchise owner in the State of Florida in the 80's. Tragically, the billionaire's daughter Nikki was killed in a car accident. Penrod decided that, rather than mourn his daughter’s passing, he would celebrate her life for years to come. In 1997, after a complete renovation, Nikki Beach Club was opened. The venue and its sister properties all over the world are a continuing homage to Nikki Penrod and the Nikki Beach brand is meant to exemplify all that she was as a person; beautiful, fun-loving, a trendsetter and cutting edge in every way.

Fast forward twenty years and you'll find the famous beach clubs in eleven destinations worldwide, including Marbella, St Barts, Mallorca and Thailand, with Dubai, Turkey and Croatia resorts to follow.

With it's all-white decor, infinity pool and super cool vibe, Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Porto Heli - a totally converted 1970s building spanning 8,000 square metres - is a place to see and be seen.

Forget trying to wangle a sea view room upgrade because each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the Agean waters, as well as personalised mini bar, 'floating bed' and Malin + Goetz toiletries. 

Well, if it's good enough for Mrs Clooney! Amal Alamuddin Clooney has been in Greece this week with Greek Culture Minister Kostas Tasoulas, after meeting him in his office in Athens as she begins advising the government on its bid to reclaim the Parthenon marbles

Who need a shared pool? Each one of the suites on the ground floor comes with its own private pool and the balconies light up by night

By night, the balcony lights turn purple, the DJ's beats subtly ramp up and the headboard lights dim to suit your mood; and that's just the standard rooms (which start at £235 a night). Elsewhere in the 5* hotel, there's suites with private pools, rooftop terraces and personal jacuzzis.

Health and fitness play a key role here - you want to look and feel good sunbathing next to Porto Heli regular, supermodel Bar Refaeli, after all. The spa offers massages and facials using ESPA products and next summer will see the opening of every woman's dream hangout - a martini manicure bar. Fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel's jetties.

You can reward your hard work in Cafe Nikki, the hotel's central restaurant offering a vast array of mouthwatering salads, gourmet burgers and the brand's iconic sushi dragon. Next summer, the resturant will offer gourmet dishes to suit the more sophisticated palette - think deconstructed Niçoise salad, sprinklings of caviar and plenty of lobster foam.

Get in shape: Fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel's jettys (or you can just lounge out there on a sunbed if you prefer)

For a more laidback vibe, head upstairs to the resort's roof terrace, Pearl, which offers delicious pan Asian cuisine and fresh and fruity cocktails set to the sound of a live house DJ.

If you can tear yourself away from poolside posing and champagne spray parties (the world record for bottles of champagne sprayed stands at an eye-watering 2,000), a 20-minute boat trip to the island of Spetses is well worth it.

A car-free island, Spetses is home to trendy bars, delicious fish eateries (we loved Tarsana), and cool clubs. After dark, you'll find Greek shipping heirs partying the night away - and a 24/7 water taxi service back to the mainland beats rushing for the last tube in London.

Yacht owners and local celebrities rest their heads at the Poseidonion Hotel, which recently celebrated its 100th birthday, and designer Etro loves it here so much, he makes the toiletries.

So who can you expect to sprawl out on a sunbed next to in one of South Greece's hip hotels? Naomi Campbell is a fan of Nikki Beach; in fact, the famous 'white parties', which celebrate the start of the season, have been hosted by her.

Eye candy: Footballer Ronaldo, left, and supermodel Bar Rafaeli both love Porto Heli

Prince William's godfather King Constantine II, the exiled King of Greece, has a holiday home and yacht here, and his sister, the former Queen Sofia of Spain, loves the area too. Her son, King Felipe of Spain, and his wife Queen Letizia have holidayed here. 

Michael Jordan, Cristiano Ronaldo and his Victoria's Secret Angel girlfriend, Irina Shayk, are rumoured to love the super exclusive Amanzoe, a ten minute drive from Porto Heli - and it's not hard to see why.

The 38-suite resort boasts a yoga studio looking out to undulating olive groves, a private beach club and a staggering 598 columns inspired by the architecture of Ancient Greece. Seeking privacy? Fear not, each pavilion suite has a private pool, housekeeper and in-house chefs who can conjure up delicacies using honey from the local bee keeper and wine from the winery down the road. But this calibre of service comes with an A-list price tag; a night at Amanzoe will set you back 1,600 euros per night.

While a weekend on the 'Greek Riviera' doesn't come cheap, who can resist panoramic views of the Aegean sea, cobalt blue waters and the chance of seeing Ronaldo in his speedos?
