Many men are often told how much they
look like their fathers, especially as they get older, a statement that 
sparked an idea for a photo project for Craig Gibson.

The
UK-based photographer decided to overlap photos of fathers and sons to 
help focus the eye on the similarities in facial features between the 
different generations.

Gibson
took countless photos of each subject to ensure that he had shots of 
both father and son’s faces that were aligned at the same angle for his 
photo series ‘Boys And Their Fathers.’

By
overlapping the images the father and sons appear to have far more 
physical attributes in common than one would notice by simply looking at
them next to each other.

Each
photograph urges the viewer to take a closer look at both father and 
son, showing that we are genetically bonded to our families, no matter 
how different we seem to be, reports My Modern Met.
