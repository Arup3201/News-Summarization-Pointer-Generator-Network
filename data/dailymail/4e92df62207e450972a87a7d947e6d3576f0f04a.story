A university chief accused of wasteful spending has been allowed to return to work on her full £250,000 salary despite having her role drastically downgraded.

Professor Wendy Purcell was suspended as vice-chancellor of Plymouth University after commissioning seven custom-made chairs costing £95,000.

She was also criticised over a three-day trip to Miami, when she stayed in a luxury boutique hotel and spent £3,500 on business-class flights.

Another report claimed she ran up a £15,000 expenses bill for first-class train travel.

Miss Purcell was suspended on full pay last summer but returned to work as Plymouth’s vice-chancellor and president in November. However, she did not resume her duties running the university and it was announced last week that she is now president only, with her former deputy now the interim vice-chancellor.

Despite her much reduced responsibilities, Freedom of Information requests from the Times Higher Education journal have revealed that Miss Purcell has returned to work on full pay. The university said: ‘The vice-chancellor’s present salary is £250,000, the same as in 2013/14.’

It refused to say whether Miss Purcell’s pay would be cut now she will not be vice-chancellor. Disclosures also show that the university has run up a £270,000 legal bill over the matter.

The university did not reply to requests for a comment. The news will pile further pressure on Plymouth over its handling of several months of crisis.

A second leading figure, retired judge William Taylor, resigned as university chairman last year amid allegations that he sexually harassed female colleagues. He denies the claims.

The controversy over Miss Purcell includes claims she was responsible for initiating a project to commission seven hand-crafted ceremonial chairs – costing £13,500 each – to be used at graduation ceremonies.

She was part of a panel that selected designer John Makepeace to lead the project.

But news of the £95,000 commission sparked anger among students and staff – despite the university’s insistence that the cost of the furniture would be met through fundraising.

The university then said that ‘approval of the project was not sought from the University Executive nor the University Board’. It later said the vice-chancellor decided she wanted no further involvement with the project but ‘did not advise cancellation’.

The Plymouth Herald newspaper reported that the university also spent £24,000 sending six staff, including Miss Purcell, on a three-day conference in Miami.

It further reported that she had taken a first-class train journey on average once every eight days for three years on expenses.
