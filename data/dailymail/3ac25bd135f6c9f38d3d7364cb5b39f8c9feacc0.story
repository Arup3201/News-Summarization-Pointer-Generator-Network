The body of London McCabe, aged six, was found on Monday after his mother allegedly threw him from an Oregon bridge 

A mommy-blogger who threw her six-year-old autistic son from a bridge told officers on the scene that voices in her head made her do it, police said today.

Jillian McCabe, 34, has been charged with aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter after allegedly throwing London McCabe from the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Newport, Oregon on Monday night. 

In a probable cause affidavit, which was issued on Tuesday prior to her arraignment, she called 911 after throwing her son 100 feet from the bridge.

She reportedly told dispatchers shortly after 6pm that her son was 'in the water and gone'.

She then described what her son was wearing along with his date of birth and details of his physical appearance.

Mrs McCabe, whose husband Matt is battling multiple sclerosis, claimed voices in her head told her to throw her son, Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda told OregonLive.

Another police officer revealed in witness statements that he had earlier passed the woman carrying a boy 'who seemed too big to be carried' on to the center of the bridge. 

Both Newport Police Department and the District Attorney's Office refused to comment on the case to MailOnline today. 

Kelly Beaudry, principal of Crestview Heights School in Waldport, said on Wednesday that London McCabe was filled with laughter and loved to sing. 

Ms Beaudry said the school will be dedicating a wall in his memory. Samples of his work with be posted and teachers can bring students to share their feelings.

The state medical examiner's office said an autopsy was being conducted on the boy.

Jillian McCabe had previously posted a number of blogs and videos on social media sites trying to raise money for the care of her son and husband, who was diagnosed with MS at the end of last year. 

In one video, recorded last year, the 34-year-old talked about how hard it was to raise her 'severely autistic' son and her desire to 'pull a Thelma and Louise'.

McCabe, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was taken in after authorities discovered the body of her son London in Oregon's Yaquina Bay just hours after she allegedly threw him off the bridge. 

Family members close to McCabe describe the young mother as mentally unstable, and old videos and blog posts written by the woman seem to highlight her difficulties raising a child with severe autism.

Family members said her downward spiral began soon after her father died and her husband, Matt, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

'I'm sorry but to wake up one day and your whole world is topsy-turvy in a world that already was topsy-turvy with our son,' Jillian said of the situation in a 2013 video.

'All of a sudden, my husband who was your provider, the caregiver, my captain Kirk, and its hard to talk to him, and everything's hard.'

In that same video, which she recorded and posted to thank her friends and people who were supporting her and her family financially after Matt lost his job, Jillian said; 'Matt and I love you guys. ... If we don't know you, we still love you. 

'You are making this experience livable versus us pulling a Thelma and Louise, which I have totally thought about.'

Other videos on her YouTube page show London throwing coins into a fountain, playing with his iPad on a hammock, and visiting his father in the hospital.

Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, told NBC News: 'Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.'

She added: 'It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get. We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.'

Tanya McCabe also said how shocked and heartbroken she was to find out what happened to London.

'Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition,' she said. 

'When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was.'  

One family member, Tanya McCabe, described Jillian as 'patient and loving' when she was caring for son London who had severe autism (above)

Matt McCabe (above with son London) has yet to comment on what happened. Mr McCabe was diagnosed with MS late last year

London's uncle, Andrew McCabe, also cited Jillian's mental instability as the cause of this horrific tragedy.

He told NBC: 'The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need.'

“She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. 

McCabe was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder, and first-degree manslaughter on Monday and is being held on $750,000 bail.

The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body 

Her first hearing will be on November 12.
