John Bercow has been accused of encouraging groaning of a Lib Dem MP every time he is called to speak in the Commons.

Cambridge MP Dr Julian Huppert claims the abuse he receives across the green benches amounts to workplace bullying which sets a ‘very bad example’ to the viewing public.

But analysis of Mr Bercow’s role in the abuse reveals his frequent mock surprise at heckling from the Labour side and repeatedly referring him to him as ‘the good doctor’.

Bullying: Lib Dem Dr Julian Huppert has complained about the abuse and groans which greet his every appearance in the Commons but Speaker John Bercow is accused of not helping with his references to the 'good doctor'

Dr Huppert has gained a reputation in Westminster for long-winded questions and interventions in debates.

He riled long-serving MPs when he arrived in the Commons in 2010 by suggesting they all needed to be sent on a crash course in basic scientific techniques.

But his every appearance in the Commons is now greeted with a chorus of abuse even before he has spoken.

Mr Bercow appears to join in with the teasing. While he calls most MPs to ask a questions simply by shouting their name, this week he announced Dr Huppert with: ‘Time for a dose from the doctor.'

One MP today claimed Mr Bercow’s behaviour ‘doesn’t help’ to curtail the abuse.

Julian Huppert is one of the most frequent speakers in the Commons, but his interventions are often long and fail to hold the attention of other MPs.

Here is an example of some of his contributions:

'I dare say that I have occasionally done things that are “capable” of annoying other people in this Chamber; I am sure we all have.' 10 June 2013'If the hon. Lady listened more and spoke less, she would hear what I am going to say.' To Labour's transport spokesman Maria Eagle 16 May 2012'A number of people said that they had become interested in politics as a result of following Twitter and receiving tweets from myself.' 13 October 2011

Dr Huppert would not be drawn specifically on the Speaker’s role in the bullying, but told The Times the joke had gone too far.

He said: ‘I think it's an example of how badly behaved Prime Minister's Questions are.

‘There are people shouting and talking in a deeply discourteous way.

"It is perfectly reasonable to respond to what people are saying but I think the atmosphere is far too often [about] trying to shout down people and that's a very bad example for everybody.’

He tried to put a brave face on the attention he now receives.

‘You have to have a bit of a thick skin. In some ways it's better to be noticed than ignored.’

At Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday Dr Huppert had only got 14 words into asking David Cameron about carers week before Mr Bercow was forced to intervene to silence the wall of jeers.

Hansard, the official record of Commons debates, often records groans of ‘Oh no!’ from MPs when Dr Huppert is called.

However, there are some who believe Dr Huppert’s striking appearance – he has a ginger goatee beard – and manner may rile and amuse his opponents.

Last month his local paper questioned why his contributions to Parliament were met with such mirth.

Daniel Zeichner, his Labour opponent in the city, told the Cambridge News: ‘Parliamentary behaviour is quite often pretty poor and I wouldn’t encourage that kind of behaviour.

‘But, having said that, Julian can sometimes be a touch annoying.’

SNP MP Angus MacNeil said that that MPs' behaviour amounted to ‘collective bullying’ and claimed that Mr Bercow ‘doesn't help’. He said: ‘For whatever reason, people are picking on him because he's brighter than them or because he has red hair.

‘Before the man has opened his mouth this nonsense has started. It's very unedifying,’ he told The Times.

Julian Huppert addresses the Commons

Regular observers of Parliament know that Commons Speaker John Bercow enjoys having his say.

All he has to do is call out an MP's name, but he rarely misses the chance to comment on the groans which greet Julian Huppert - which only seems to encourage them:'Order. It is very discourteous of the House to issue a collective groan - notably on the Opposition Benches. It is quite inexplicable. I have called the good doctor; let us hear from the good doctor.' 13 February 2013

'I have a choice on the Lib Dem Benches between two doctors. Let us hear from the good Dr Julian Huppert.' 25 March 2013

'Members on both sides are very discourteous to the good doctor. I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are groans whenever I call the good doctor, but it is very unsatisfactory.' 24 April 2013

'I call Dr Julian Huppert. If he can speak more briefly—he does not have to—more Members will get in.' 21 May 2013

'I am looking for a sharp mind and pithy expression, and I need look no further than Dr Julian Huppert.' 3 June 2013

'Time for a dose from the doctor.' 10 June 2013

'I have no idea what more there could be to ask, but I have a feeling that the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) will have an idea.' 14 June 2013
