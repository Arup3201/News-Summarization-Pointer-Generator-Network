There appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary in the parking lot of this Virginia Beach apartment complex - until a speeding fighter jet dropped out of the sky and crashed there in a fiery wreck.

Part of the dramatic April 6 crash were captured by a security camera that was rotating just yards away from where the Navy F-18 slammed to earth.

The two-seater F-18 jet crashed into the Mayfield 
Mews apartment complex, about a mile from the Atlantic Ocean,, after suffering a 'catastrophic 
mechanical malfunction' during a training flight.

Streak: The fighter jet can be seen as a blur before crashing into the apartment complex

Visibility: The jet is moving so fast that it can only be seen in two frames of the video - and even then, it's just a blur

Before and after: As the camera panned back to the apartment, the building that was one standing is now leveled by the crash

In a true 'blink or you'll miss it' moment, the camera slowly pans in the parking lot of the complex before the aircraft quickly streaks across the screen.

The jet is moving so fast that it can only be seen in two frames of the video. And even in those two frames, it is just a blur.

While the camera was not fixed on the building at the time of the crash, the moment of impact can be seen in a reflection on a car door, glowing bright orange as flames erupt from the downed jet.

As the tape continues rolling, a driver appears not to notice what had just happened as he calmly exits the parking lot.

Response: Moments after the crash, police and firefighters can be seen arriving at the scene

Flames: Callers flooded 911 following the sudden impact of the jet into the apartment complex in Virginia Beach

Inferno: Though the pilots expelled most of the fuel before crashing, the fuselage caught ablaze as people called for help

Moments later, residents, police and firefighters are on the scene to deal with the emergency situation.

Miraculously, no one on the ground was killed, and both pilots had ejected safely from the plane.

Three three buildings and damaging more than 65 of the housing units  of the Mayfield Mews were destroyed, and several residents were hospitalized with smoke and stress-related injuries.

The pilots ejected from the plane and are credited with 
saving lives by dumping their fuel seconds before impact.

Aircraft: The jet was an F/A-18D, similar to the one seen here

Concerns: There are no known fatalities from the dramatic crash, but three elderly residents who lived in the apartment block are unaccounted for

Wrecked: An aerial view of the apartments shows the roofs of several buildings completely destroyed

Bruce Nedelka, the Virginia Beach EMS
 division chief, said that it seemed like the pilots were dumping the 
jetâ€™s fuel prior to the crash.

That action likely prevented a 
massive fireball upon impact, he said.

'He mitigated what could have 
been an absolute massive, massive fireball. With all of that jet fuel 
dumped, it was much less than what it could have been.'

The Navy said that 
the jet was an F/A-18D assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 106 based at 
Naval Air Station Ocean. It crashed shortly after 
takeoff at a site near the base at about 12:05pm.
