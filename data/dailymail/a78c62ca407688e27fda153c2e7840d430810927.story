A thug who carried out horrifying acts of torture for Robert Mugabe escaped jail yesterday – despite earning £151,000 while working illegally in Britain.

Phillip Machemedze, 47, was able to work here for seven years as a carer for those with learning disabilities and on a unit dealing with drug and alcohol addicts.

He was able to secure the jobs by  showing a letter from the Home Office, a National Insurance number and birth and marriage certificates. These documents were not checked properly in a series of failures.

Asylum: Phillip Machemedze, a former henchman of Robert Mugabe, earned £151,000 while working illegally in Britain

There was outrage earlier this year when he was allowed to stay in Britain to protect his human rights.

An immigration court in May ruled he must be allowed to stay because he could face mistreatment if sent back to Zimbabwe.

Yesterday he admitted breaking immigration rules – but was told he will not be jailed if he volunteers for just half a day a week for the next six months.

Dictator: Robert Mugabe's former henchman was working as a carer

Machemedze – who is now jobless and 
trying to claim benefits – admitted two charges of obtaining pecuniary 
advantage by deception.

Judge
 Julian Lambert deferred sentencing for six months, but told him he had 
to work for half a day a week at his local Pentecostal church.

‘I require you to work hard with your church to make better the lives of the poor and needy,’ he said.

‘You
 should bring letters to show the good work you have done. I expect you 
to devote half a day each week to serving the community through your 
church. If I see you have done good work when you return and I have your
 promise that you will continue that good work I shall give you your 
liberty.’

Machemedze, from Bristol, worked as a bodyguard in Mugabe’s feared Central Intelligence Organisation.

An immigration hearing heard he 
committed ‘savage acts of extreme violence’, including torturing 
numerous political opponents of the Mugabe regime.

He smashed one victim’s jaw with a  pair of pliers, before pulling out one of  their teeth.

Another victim was electrocuted, 
slapped, beaten and punched unconscious and a woman victim  was taken to
 an underground cell where she was stripped naked and whipped.

Machemedze admitted putting salt in her wounds.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who represents
 Kingswood, Bristol, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that our system allows these
 people who have committed crimes elsewhere to remain in this country.

Escape: Machemedze leaves Bristol Crown Court yesterday after learning he will not be jailed

‘It’s ludicrous that people can hide 
behind human rights acts in order to prevent themselves from being sent 
back to their own country to face justice.’

Yesterday Richard Posner, prosecuting,
 told Bristol Crown Court that Machemedze arrived at Gatwick Airport 
from Zimbabwe in July 2000 and was given a six-month visitor visa which 
banned him from working.

But he stayed in Britain, working 
illegally as a carer at the adolescent unit within The Priory, a drug 
and alcohol recovery hospital, in Stapleton, Bristol, from June 2005 to 
May 2010.

He also worked as a support worker for
 the Milestones Trust, a learning disabilities and mental health charity
 from May 2003 to May 2010.

In April 2005 bosses at the Milestones
 Trust were tipped off that Machemedze was working illegally but after 
Machemedze showed them the Home Office letter the matter was dropped.

Mr Posner told the court: ‘At a 
subsequent meeting the defendant provided a letter from the Home Office 
confirming he was allowed to work in the UK.

‘That letter was deemed satisfactory and he was allowed to continue to work.

‘This case is primarily the use of 
that Home Office letter in order to create a deception that the 
defendant was allowed to work here.’

The court was told that in the seven years he had worked Machemedze took home a net income of around £151,000.

Jane Chamberlain, defending, said her 
client had indefinite leave to remain in the country and was allowed to 
work but was now unemployed and seeking benefits. Machemedze’s wife 
Febbie had been granted asylum.
