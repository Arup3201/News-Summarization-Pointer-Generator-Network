The family of the black teenager shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, have claimed that he knew all along he would get away with it.

Relatives of Michael Brown said that Darren Wilson had such ‘brazen confidence’ that he must have been thinking he would never be prosecuted when he opened fire.

They claimed that he treated the unarmed 18-year-old as ‘less than human’ by shooting him six times as he had his hands raised in surrender.

Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's family has claimed Wilson was 'brazen' in shooting the teenager multiple times, knowing he would suffer no consequences

'Less than human': The family's submission, to be given to a U.N. committee tomorrow, says Wilson's disregard to Michael Brown's body after he shot him dead shows endemic racism in Ferguson's police force

Submission: Members of Brown's family, including his father Michael Brown Senior, left, and Lesley McSpadden, right, have written a report on the event for a UN torture committee

Brown’s family also called for the embattled Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson to step down because his department has targeted blacks in a ‘predatory and degrading manner’.

And they demanded that all protesters who were arrested during the unrest in August be given an amnesty because they had been treated unfairly.

Brown’s family will appear before the United Nations Committee Against Torture in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday to argue that what happened in Ferguson amounts to a breach of the organization’s rules.

A grand jury is currently deciding whether to indict Wilson, 28, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks.

Leaks reported by the St Louis Post Dispatch and the New York Times suggest that he will not be prosecuted, and the community is said to be preparing itself for yet more violence.

Demonstrations: Brown's death sparked protests and vigils in Ferguson, where riot police officers came toe-to-toe with furious activists accusing them of racial violence

'Brazen': The family says the killing is part of a culture of discrimination. Above, investigators, not including Wilson, inspect Brown's body after the killing 

'Intimidation': The Brown family has also demanded that Missouri's Governor apologize for the treatment of protesters, who were met with a heavy police presence

When Brown was shot dead on August 9, Ferguson tore itself apart in two weeks of angry protests and looting that was met with a militarized response by the police which sparked a national debate on race relations.

MailOnline has seen a copy of the report that Browns’ family will present to the UN, and it gives one of the starkest illustrations yet of the family’s sense of injustice.

In it, Brown’s father Michael Brown Sr and his mother Leslie McSpadden speak of their anger that their son’s dead body was left bleeding in the street for four hours.

They write: ‘Given the history of racial tensions in the city of Ferguson, this particularly disrespectful treatment of Brown’s body and callous disregard for the trauma it could cause Ferguson residents repeated and reinforced the longstanding degrading treatment of black racial minorities by an overwhelmingly white police force.

Severe: The world was shocked by the use of heavy weaponry and riot gear in response to the protests

Severe: Ranks of armed officers faced down protesters, who were buffeted with tear gas and stun grenades

‘Not only did the abandonment of the body convey to residents that the police officer regarded the black youth as less than human, but it also illustrated the officer’s brazen confidence that he would not be punished for such unwarranted violence’.

In the document Brown’s family call for the immediate arrest of Wilson, who is in hiding at an undisclosed location.

They also want the Ferguson police department to be placed under ‘federal receivership to hold it accountable for systematically targeting and harassing residents of color in a predatory and degrading manner’.

Among their other calls is a demand from Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to apologize for the ‘intimidation and excessive force used against’ protesters.

They also say they want an ‘amnesty to those protesters arrested while protesting the killing of Michael Brown.’

Ferguson and St Louis are currently on edge as they wait for the verdict of the grand jury amid reports that Chief Jackson will be made to step down, though he has denied the claims.

Meanwhile, what actually happened on that night is still disputed, with witnesses giving wildly different accounts.

What is clear is that Wilson stopped Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson as they walked along Canfield Drive in Ferguson as they were heading back to Brown’s house.

Wilson drove off, then backed up and stopped in the middle of the street to talk to them again.

Protests: Thousands have taken to the streets of Ferguson in outrage over the incident

Response: Police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations

In leaked reports of his testimony to the grand jury, which is held in secret, Wilson supposedly said that Brown pushed him back into his police SUV as he was trying to get out and pinned him down.

At that point Wilson reached for his gun and fired two shots, one of which hit Brown, whose blood was found inside the car.

The account did not explain why Wilson then shot Brown five more times in the front as, according to some witnesses, he put his hands in the air to surrender.

Brown’s supporters are worried that Wilson is trying to exploit the law in Missouri which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat.

Wilson’s account also flatly contradicts that of witnesses including Johnson, who was standing next to him at the time.

Johnson has said that Wilson was the aggressor and grabbed Brown's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot.

Another witness, whose name has been withheld, has also reportedly told the grand jury that Brown did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot him but instead they were 'out to his sides.'

He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.'

In addition to the grand jury, a separate federal prosecution into Brown’s shooting was started by former Attorney General Eric Holder - but reportedly has too little evidence to take Wilson to court.

Brown’s parents' trip to Geneva is being sponsored by the U.S. Human Rights Network, a nonprofit organization.

According to the Ferguson to Geneva official website, ‘the goal of this trip is not only to achieve justice in Ferguson, but is intended to unite governments around the world against the human rights violations that result from racial profiling and police violence.’
