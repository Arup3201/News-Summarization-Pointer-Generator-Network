Rev Howard Curtis was arrested on suspicion of assaulting three people at Coulsdon Christian Fellowship

A church minister has been arrested over claims he spanked worshippers.

Rev Howard Curtis, 70, allegedly persuaded worshippers to undress for him in the office of Coulsdon Christian Fellowship, in Croydon, south London.

The claims are believed to centre around a movement known as Christian Domestic Discipline, which involves men asserting authority over women through physical punishment, usually spanking.

Mr Curtis has been banned from unsupervised contact with children and forbidden from attending his own church alone while the Metropolitan Police probes allegations about his conduct.

Three people have lodged assault allegations against Mr Curtis, senior minister, who is believed to have been involved with the church for at least two decades.

They include claims he asked women to strip in his office before spanking them. The assaults are alleged to have happened between 2006 and 2009.

He was arrested in July and has been bailed until October 22 while police continue their investigation.

Mr Curtis denied the allegations, which he described as 'malicious'.

Speaking outside his home in Croydon, on Monday, he said: 'I have not done anything wrong, but it seems you are guilty as soon as you are accused. The police seem to think so, arresting me.

'I believe these allegations were maliciously made. I don't even know exactly what I have been accused of. I am having to wait while the police investigate.'

Mr Curtis said he had 'heard of' Christian Domestic Discipline, but refused to be drawn on whether he practised it.

Worshippers at Coulsdon Christian Fellowship, which describes itself as an 'independent charismatic Baptist church' in Chipstead Valley Road, also declined to discuss the practice on Monday.

They said Mr Curtis was no longer involved with the church but would not comment further.

Rev Dominic Warner, a minister at the church, did not respond to requests for a comment.

Mr Curtis is also chairman of Coulsdon Chess Fellowship and listed as a trustee of the 1st Coulsdon Scout Group, both of which meet at the church.

The website of Christian Domestic Discipline says the practice is 'intended to be a haven for married couples who practise safe and consensual' discipline.

It espouses that women are the 'heart' of the home, while men are the 'head'.

The website states that 'most CDD marriages use spanking', for offences including disobedience, disrespect, dishonesty or dangerous choices.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
