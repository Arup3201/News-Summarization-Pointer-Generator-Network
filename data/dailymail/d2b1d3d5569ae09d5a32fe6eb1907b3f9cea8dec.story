UKIP supporters in Rotherham have been driving around in a pickup truck covered in anti-European slogans with a number plate containing the letters 'EEC'. 

The 2001 Nissan 2.5 diesel pick up truck was spotted carrying a large triangular sign around the Yorkshire town featuring the embarrassing number plate in advance of a visit by party leader Nigel Farage. 

The rear of the truck featured an unflattering photograph of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, above a slogan claiming 'Vote Labour Get Merkel'.

Ukip supporters in Rotherham prepared for a visit by party leader Nigel Farage in a 2001 Nissan pickup truck carrying anti-EU slogans but featuring the letters EEC on its number plate 

The pickup truck, pictured,  featured slogans attacking Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Angela Merkel 

The Ukip leader wanted to visit Rotherham as it is one of his party's main targets in the north of England

The left-hand-side of the truck had a photograph of Prime Minister David Cameron photoshopped onto a chicken beside the words: 'Come on David, Let's Talk About Broken Promises On Immigration.'

The opposite side had a photograph of a gagged Ed Miliband featuring 'No Voice For The Working Man'.

The truck was spotted otuside the UKIP campaign headquarters of their parliamentary hopeful Jane Collins.

Vice-chairman of the Ukip's Rotherham branch John Wilkinson told Mail Online that the number plate should not offend his party's supporters. 

'The EEC no longer exists so I don't think that this is an issue. It disappeared with the introduction of the European Union. I have no idea about the vehicle as it does not belong to me. 

'It belongs to someone from another Ukip branch who came to Rotherham to provide support for Nigel's visit.'

The Ukip leader visited Rotherham last week where he was confronted by a large group of protesters and was forced to remain inside the party's new office in the town. 

South Yorkshire police told Mr Farage that he should remain inside after the anti-Ukip demonstrators congregated outside the office. 

After almost two hours he was led to safety under a large red umbrella.

Rotherham is one of the party's main target seats in the north of England after they returned 10 councillors in the last local elections.

The party is campaigning heavily on the handling of the Rotherham grooming scandal.

Following the demonstration, a Ukip statement said: 'These protesters aren't the real people of Rotherham. This is the Labour Party running scared and trying to shut down any voice of opposition.

'They are just people who are trying to stifle democratic debate. Surely they should be directing their anger at those who presided over the industrial scale of abuse in this town, rather than those who are trying to change it for the better.

'They are more interested in keeping power than serving the people, which is what led to the cover-up.'
