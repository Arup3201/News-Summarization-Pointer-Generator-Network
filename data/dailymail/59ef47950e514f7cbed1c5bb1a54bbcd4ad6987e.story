Rolling Stone Keith Richards has objected to a planned £1.5million cafe being built on a beachfront near his country mansion. 

The 71-year-old guitarist has lodged an objection against the new development which is near his Redlands estate where he was famously arrested with band mate Mick Jagger in 1967 in a drugs raid. 

Richards is opposed to the planned restaurant which is earmarked for West Wittering beach in West Sussex.

The new restaurant is planned to replace a smaller beach cafe which burned down due to an electrical fault in October last year. 

However, many local residents are opposed to the new, larger development. 

The Rolling Stone musician has written to planning authorities to express his objection to the plan. 

He said: 'The second-storey restaurant overlooks and is visible from the sea and beach. It spoils the natural beauty and seclusion of the beach. It dominates the area and degrades its character.

'The restaurant threatens the environment and locals. It cannot be allowed.'

Richards has objected to several other planned developments near his property, which is surrounded by its own moat.  

The new building would replace a cafe that was damaged by a fire caused by an electrical fault in October last year, and it has been operating from the life savers' hut since then.

West Wittering Estate runs the cafe and the company are proposing the planned redevelopment.

It has around 390 shareholders who purchased the land in 1952 to keep it as unspoilt and as undeveloped as possible.

Peter Dawson, Mr Richards' neighbour, said he was 'gobsmacked' when he saw the plans.

Shareholder Warren Tayler said he was surprised the new building had been located closer to the sea as an erosion map created by the Environment Agency showed the site 'was predicted to be eroded' by 2105.

He said: 'It's an enormous development on a beach which is preserved not to have development.

'It will be visible for everybody boating or sailing and all up the Channel.

Mr Tayler also said it would be 'dangerous' to have premises selling alcohol in a secluded area so close to the sea.

The plans include space to sit 60 indoors and 40 outdoors in seating on a terrace which overlooks the beach.

Developers want to build the new restaurant on a beach less than two miles from the musician's house

The planned beachfront restaurant is just two miles form Keith Richards' Elizabethan house 

A small restaurant is planned on the upper floor during the daytime, with a self-service cafe on the ground floor, take-away windows and ice cream kiosks.

Patrick Byrne, a director of the estate, said the building had been sited nearer the beach so visitors could enjoy sea views for the next 50 years, as plans had not been made for the next 100 years.

He said the building's wooden exterior would help it blend into the landscape and that it would have be eco-friendly solar panels.

Stephen Hammett, chairman of the estate, said: 'We believe it will provide a tasteful improvement, and it has been carefully designed to ensure the overall feel of the estate remains unspoilt and as natural as possible.

'Our aim is to provide our customers with a better service of food and drink, so that visiting West Wittering is an even better experience than before.' 

Following a trial in 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months in prison for possession of amphetamines, while Richards was jailed for a year for allowing cannabis to be smoked in his home. 

Both sentences were overturned on appeal.
