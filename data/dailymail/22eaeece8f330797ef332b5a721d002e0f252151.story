A Mexican singer has posed with a jar apparently containing two of her ribs.

Ariadna Thalia Sodi Miranda - known solely as Thalía - has taunted fans for years with the suggestion that she had two ribs removed to make her waist thinner.

Last week, the 42-year-old reignited the rumour by mentioning it in an interview. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Shocking: Mexican singer Thalía has posed with a jar of the ribs she apparently removed to look thinner

Taunting: This is the latest of a number of teasing vines released by the singer about the myth

She then posted a video of herself on Instagram, holding her bare abdomen, with the caption: 'You think I removed my ribs? Yes, no? #ThaliasRibs #Myth'

Now, the performer, who has a strong Filipino fan base, has posted another video - of her ribs apparently pickling in a jar.

The teasing vine shows her gasping as she sits on a sunny balcony with the jar on a table in front of her.

Posting it on Instagram, she wrote: 'To all my loving Filipino fans, here is the proof! I love my famous ribs, I kept them with me all these years! And the saga continues...'

It is still unclear whether the video was a joke.

Thalía has been dubbed both the 'Queen of Latin Pop' and 'Queen of Telenovelas [hispanic soaps]' during her prolific career as a singer, songwriter, actress, author and entrepreneur.

She has released her own clothing line, starred in numerous Mexican soaps, and sold 40 million records

She first starred in a commercial at the age of one and has sold 40 million records worldwide.

The myth surrounding her ribs is set to continue, as she teasingly posted on Instagram that there is another video to come.
