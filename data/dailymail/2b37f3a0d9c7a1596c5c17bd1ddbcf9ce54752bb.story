'Mad period of collecting eggs': Former Suffolk policeman Michael Upson raided the nests of rare wild birds

A retired policeman who stole eggs from the nests of rare wild birds was today warned that he could be jailed.

Michael Upson, 52, raided the nests while he was a Suffolk police constable and acting sergeant.

Police found 649 eggs, along with secret diaries detailing how they had been taken, when they searched Upson's cottage on June 21 this year.

Norwich magistrates heard that the eggs were hidden in margarine cartons, kept in a battered suitcase in his loft.

The court was told that officers found a fake index card system, which suggested that all the eggs dated back to before 1954 - the year when taking eggs from nests became illegal.

But the search also uncovered plastic boxes containing the diaries and another set of catalogue cards, hidden inside Upson's attic water tank.

These documents corresponded exactly with the eggs in Upson's collection and indicated that they had been taken from nests of different species between 1991 and 2001.

Upson, of Sotherton, near Halesworth, Suffolk, admitted possessing 584 wild eggs - an offence under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.

The married father of two also pleaded guilty to a separate offence of possessing 65 eggs of Schedule One rare birds, which are the most protected in the UK.

The court head that the Schedule One eggs comprised seven from a marsh harrier, 53 from woodlark and five from a cettis warbler.

A further charge of having equipment to steal eggs was withdrawn.

Magistrates suggested he could be jailed, but adjourned sentencing until Thursday so that the probation service can investigate whether a community order is suitable.

Prosecutor Judith Piggin told the court that police had found egg-carrying boxes hidden in towels in Upson's airing cupboard as well as the eggs, secret diaries and catalogue cards in the attic.

Taken: Some of the eggs from rare species which were found in Michael Upson's Suffolk home

Collection: Diaries kept by Upson indicated that the eggs had been taken from nests of different species between 1991 and 2001

She said officers had also seized drills for blowing eggs, photographs and around 50 Ordnance Survey maps, including some marked with nesting sites.

Miss Piggin said: 'The defendant attended the police station and made admissions that for a number of years he had built up a collection of eggs, but said he had stopped many years ago.

'He was unable to give more information as to when and how they were found and how the collection was built up.

'The defendant admitted that all the eggs found were his and that he was a serving officer throughout the time that he had collected them.'

Miss Piggin said the woodlark eggs were all taken from the Dunwich and Westleton Heath in Suffolk and his actions would have had an 'environmental impact' on the bird population in the area.

Guilty: Upson admitted possessing 584 wild eggs and a further 65 eggs of Schedule One rare birds, which are the most protected in the UK

She also asked magistrates to make an order for Upson's egg collection, diaries, cards, maps and photographs to be destroyed.

The court heard that Upson could not be charged with collecting eggs as charges had to be brought within two years of the offence.

Roger Thomson, defending, described Upson as a keen naturalist and ornithologist since he was a child.

He added that the retired officer was of previous good character with no police disciplinary issues.

Mr Thomson said: 'He is not charged with taking eggs, but we cannot ignore that because he admits that is what he did.

'He said he went through a mad period of collecting eggs in the 1990s at the time when he was having marriage problems with his first wife and suffering from depression. It was a way of getting over it.

Hidden: The eggs were stored in margarine cartons, kept in a battered suitcase in the loft of Upson's cottage

Troubled: The court heard that Upson collected the eggs when he was having marital problems and suffering from depression

'He was a police officer at the time and should have known better, but you have to balance that against the fact that it is ancient history.'

Mr Thomson said Upson's collection had been 'gathering dust in his attic' since 2001 and he had not looked at it or attempted to sell or swap any of his eggs.

Presiding magistrate Eamon Lambert suggested that Upson could be jailed for 14 weeks.

But he adjourned sentencing to allow time for a probation report to investigate whether a 'satisfactory community penalty' could be found.

Outside court, Upson, who worked as a training officer at Suffolk Police headquarters in Martlesham before retiring in August, denied that he had taken any eggs while on duty.

But this claim was challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, who said that one of Upson's diary entries indicated that he had taken kittiwake eggs from Lowestoft pier while he was on a police night shift.

Misleading: Police searching Upson's home found a fake index card system, which suggested that all the eggs dated back to before 1954 - the year when taking eggs from nests became illegal

Diaries: Documents detailing how the eggs had been taken were hidden inside Upson's attic water tank

The charity also said that the diaries suggested that Upson had helped another collector take golden eagle eggs on a trip to the Outer Hebrides in April 1997, although no such eggs were found in his own collection.

Mark Thomas, a senior investigator for the RSPB, said: 'That a police officer should knowingly break the law in pursuit of this obsession is shocking, and we welcome his conviction.

'Evidence from the diaries indicates that Upson stole over 900 wild bird eggs in an eight-year period. Not all of these eggs were recovered.'

Mr Thomas said that Upson's diaries revealed he had waded through marshes up to his waist to steal the cettis warbler eggs from a reserve at Slapton Ley, Devon.

Upson also went to North Wales to steal chough eggs and the New Forest to take hawfinch eggs, he added.

Mr Thomas said: 'Upson kept detailed records which linked him to all the eggs in his collection.

'Some of the eggs he had were from very rare species. He took 54 woodlark eggs at a time when there were only believed to be 500 breeding pairs in the country.

'He also detailed his diaries how he had helped another collector take golden eagles' eggs in the Outer Hebrides.

'He said in interview that he felt ashamed about what he did, but he would not say where the eggs were now or who the man was.'
