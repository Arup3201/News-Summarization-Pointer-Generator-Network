Their hands no bigger than postage stamps, this is the heartwarming moment that tiny twins Blair and Innes reached out to touch one another for the first time.

Just one week earlier, the brothers had been born weighing little more than 3lbs and rushed to intensive care, where doctors feared they might not make a full recovery.

But as soon as the twins were reunited side-by-side, the newborns reached out across the incubator and clasped onto one another, forming a brotherly bond that will never be broken.

The adorable moment, which their parents captured on camera, melted the hearts of the doctors and nurses who had been looking after them at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

For parents Laura and Craig, from Duddingston, Edinburgh, it was also one of the most special moments of their lives.

Mrs Lowden, who went into labour at just 30 weeks, said: 'It was the most wonderful thing to see. So touching. This will always remain a very special moment for us.

'We were amazed to see them reach out for each other after being parted.'

Blair and Innes were born ten weeks early on February 5 this year and transferred immediately to intensive care.

Blair had been born first, weighing just 3lbs 2oz, while Innes weighed 3lbs 3oz. 

But doctors were amazed when, one week later, the baby boys began to breathe on their own.

The non-identical brothers were then placed back together in an incubator, when the special moment took place.

Mr Lowden, 32, said: 'It was so cute.'

The boys had been born by Caesarean section before being transferred to their separate incubators.

Mrs Lowden, a senior gas and oil analyst with Lloyds Bank, said she had been totally unprepared for their sons' arrival.

'The antenatal class on labour wasn't until the following week and we still had a few baby clothes and equipment to buy,' she said. 

'Babies, though, are unpredictable and you just have to go with the flow, as they say.' 

She added: 'Staff at the hospital have been wonderful and the boys are being treated with the utmost care and attention.

'The midwives tell us the boys are a good weight for twins 10 weeks early.' 

Most babies are not able to breathe on their own until 34 weeks into pregnancy because their lungs do not mature until then.

But Mrs Lowden was injected with steroids after she went into labour, which helped the young twins make a quicker recovery. 

'It appears to have worked and we are delighted they are doing so well,' added Mr Lowden.

'They have progressed enough to be breathing on their own in special care which is a great step forward from intensive care.'  

Twins are 57 per cent more likely to be born three or more weeks early, say obstetricians.

Their special bond starts developing prior to birth according to emeritus psychology Professor Elvidina Adamson-Macedo.

The expert said: 'These twins are very likely to be replicating something they did before birth.

'Memory is formed before birth and babies touch from just over seven weeks gestation.'
