Serena Williams has departed  Wimbledon but the mystery about her bizarre display on Tuesday has deepened, with doubts cast on the ‘viral illness’ explanation.

The world No 1 lasted three games in her doubles match, serving four hopeless double faults in her one service game before defaulting, looking dishevelled and disorientated.

Serena  insisted this was due to a ‘bug’, yet according to authoritative sources her pulse, temperature and blood pressure were normal when she received an on-court visit from the doctor.

Furthermore, Williams’s half-sister Isha Price told the newspaper USA Today that  Serena did not appear ill before the match and she was unaware that any  medication was being taken. ‘She seemed emotional, sad, you know what I mean?’ said Price.

Serena’s French coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, added that he had not seen her for two days before the tie. ‘Before the match she was fine,’ he said.

The reaction of her sister Venus during the incident was interesting. The two are incredibly close yet she did not seem massively concerned for her sibling’s well-being, looking instead bemused and frustrated.

Serena was crestfallen after her third-round exit from the singles on Saturday against France’s Alize Cornet and,  referring to her partnership with Venus in its aftermath, said: ‘I suck right now at  doubles, I told Venus I am so bad that I don’t even want to play.’

The incident will only heighten speculation about her relationship with Mouratoglou, with whom she has enjoyed a career surge in her early thirties. Although Mouratoglou has never commented on the pair’s romantic involvement, there were reports at the recent French Open that the partnership has become purely professional in nature.

Alternative theories are that she was acting, or was in a highly emotional state and unable to function. As one medical source said, the bug she described would have made her feel ill but not affected her co-ordination in such a way that was evident.

It may be that this will be added to the list of  mysteries that have sprung up during a long career. In November 2011, at home in Los Angeles, she hid in a panic room after a drug-tester called at her house unannounced. Serena said she believed it was an intruder.

Another is the long injury lay-off after she won Wimbledon in  2010. The explanation was that she had stepped on broken glass in a Munich restaurant, and that the injury required surgery. The restaurant in question has never been identified.

Williams is due to play next week at the Swedish Open, but whether she turns up or not is one of the many questions  surrounding her future.
