Julie Bishop has taken her love of emojis to another level by opting to answer a question from Today's Karl Stefanovic by morphing her face into one of the characters.

The Foreign Minister was asked if she knew what a Thermomix was after several Senators were left confused on Tuesday when the $2,000 cooking appliance appeared on a list of items the Governor General was after for his two residences.

'This is how it was discussed in Senate estimates yesterday... they said they didn't know what a Thermomix is. Julie Bishop, do you know what a Thermomix is?' Stefanovic asked. 

Ms Bishop responded: 'I'm going to answer in emoji' as she raised her eyebrows and stared wide-eyed into the camera.

'That's why you rock, Julie Bishop,' Stefanovic said as he laughed hysterically.

Ms Bishop has made her love of emojis clear in the past having once only responded to tweets with the characters for several hours.  

Her response comes after the multi-talented kitchen appliance sparked debate in a Senate hearing on Tuesday when Labor senator Joe Ludwig read through a list of kitchen appliances put forward by Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove. 

'You're seeking four stick blenders, two food processors... and you're going to have to help me with this - a Thermomix?' he said.

'I don't know what a Thermomix is.'

The Governor General's list of appliances, estimated to be worth between $80,000-$100,000, are for his two residences - Yarralumla in Canberra and Admiralty House in Sydney.

Committee chair and South Australian senator Cory Bernardi ridiculed Mr Ludwig, asking: 'Where have you been?'

The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following with thousands of loyal users around the world.

'Queensland,' Senator Ludwig responded. 'A kitchen aid mixer, an upright freezer, a deep fryer and a pasta machine. And what's a Thermomix?,' he continued.

The Governor General's official secretary, Mark Fraser, confessed: 'I don't know what a Thermomix is.'

'So there are a couple of us who don't know what a Thermomix is,' Senator Ludwig announced.

Attempting to fill the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee in on the almost $2,000 kitchen toy, Senator Bernardi explained: 'They're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today.'

They cannot be bought in stores and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. 

There are more than 3,000 Thermomix consultants across Australia.

'Is that the elite trendies that use that, are they?' asked Senator Ludwig.

The Governor General's office has requested a Thermomix but the Governor General's official secretary Mark Fraser (left) was forced to confess to Labor senator Joe Ludwig (right) he didn't know what it is

The Governor General's (pictured) office put out a tender for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment

'In Queensland, you may refer to them as that, I just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking,' Senator Bernardi retorted.

Noticing he'd touched a nerve, Senator Ludwig probed: 'Is that the new model or the old model?'

'I'm no Masterchef myself all I know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' Mr Fraser said.

Senator Ludwig then took the opportunity to point out how much the Governor General's office is spending elsewhere.

'You have $168,000 spent on redundancies, one involuntary, you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor… the previous Governor General managed not to require them.

'And now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount, plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances. You wonder where the priorities are,' he said.

But Mr Fraser reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the 'heritage properties'.

'We're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items,' he said.
