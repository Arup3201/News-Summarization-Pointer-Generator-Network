Arrested: Kristen Forester, 18, was pulled over for speeding and driving recklessly on a street in Fort Pierce, Florida

A Florida teenager who was pulled over for reckless driving was wearing only her underwear when police arrested her for drink driving.

Kristen Forester, 18, of the 3100 block of North U.S. 1 in Fort Pierce, was arrested on a DUI charge at 3:16am on October 21.

Police stopped Forester, who was driving a 2001 Honda, for speeding and driving recklessly on Seaway Drive.

In
the police dash cam video, posted by TCPalm.com, the girl is seen standing in front of the 
police car swaying as she waits for the police officer to start field 
sobriety exercises.

She had already put a T-shirt on but had no bottoms on except for panties.

According to the report, the police officer asked her why she was not wearing clothes.

Naked incident: Kristen Forester, 18, was pulled over by police in Fort Pierce wearing only her panties and bra. She put on a T-shirt before stepping out of the car

'Just a little bit': Forester admitted to the police officer that she had had 'a shot' before driving

Forester replied she had been ‘at work and drove home like that’.

Her place of employment was not listed, however she admitted to the police officer that she had had ‘a shot’ before driving.

Forester had to do a series of sobriety tests, including standing on one leg, walking down a straight line and touching her finger to her nose with her eyes closed. She failed all of them and was subsequently arrested.

Breath tests measured her blood alcohol content at 0.157 and 0.144 -- greater than the legal limit of 0.08.

Follow the finger: The police officer asks the teen to follow his finger with just her eyes without moving her head left and right in the first sobriety test

The officer explains to the driver how to angle her foot in one of the sobriety tests

Nice try: Forester is seen attempting to stand on one foot but struggles and eventually loses her balance

Walk the line: She is then asked to walk a straight line with one foot after the next without falling out of balance

Forester, wearing a sports shirt, is then asked to stand facing the dash cam in the police car

Final test: The officer asks her to close her eyes and touch her nose

Missed! Forester can't find her nose on most of the attempts, instead putting her finger on her lips. The officer indicates this to the camera and his colleagues who are watching

One more: She tries again and misses again as the officer cracks a little smile

Game over: Forester is subsequently arrested after failing the sobriety tests
