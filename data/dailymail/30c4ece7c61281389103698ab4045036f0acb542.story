A Romanian couple wanted by Interpol for an alleged $68million tax evasion built a network of sealed bunkers under their rural Washington home where they could have hid out for months. 

Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, built a network of bunkers and passages and filled them with stockpiles of gold coins and food at their home, set on 53 acres in Yelm.

The fascinating details emerged in recently-unsealed FBI documents on the alleged Romanian fraudsters. The couple were arrested in March and are facing extradition to Romania after being accused of working with corrupt politicians in their home country on the massive tax dodge.

The bunker could be sealed from the inside on the rural Yelm property and was stockpiled with goods

Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, are facing extradition to Romania to face charges that they dodged millions in fuel taxes. They were caught hiding out in Washington state where they had joined a spiritual group

The couple had accrued a number of 
properties, including a $3million log cabin, and number of businesses in
 Washington which are believed to have been paid for with laundered 
money.

Millions were also spent on gold and silver coins, construction equipment and at least on yacht.

Mr Nemes and his wife Diana, who is 38 and pregnant with her third child, poured thousands of dollars into building the elaborate bunker. The couple have two other sons, aged eight and nine.

The shelter could be sealed from the inside and had food, water, a working kitchen and practical supplies to live for months.

A stash of four pistols and two rifles including an AR-15-style assault rifle were found at the home.

According to court papers seen by Seattle PI, investigators searching the property with radar equipment discovered a 'fully equipped and furnished underground bunker'.

'That bunker could comfortably have housed the entire family for months if not years, given the supply of food found in storage in that structure,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said in court papers.

The FBI also reported that the Nemes had been traveling the U.S. on first-class flights. They spent more than $200,000 at designer boutiques and blew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.

The couple allegedly moved their 70-ft yacht â€“ the Ramaya â€“ from the Mediterranean in late 2012. It was sold months later for $2.3million.

The bunker, which was stacked with chemicals and food supplies, was discovered by the FBI last month using radar equipment

The Nemes, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012 after reportedly fleeing their native Romania following charges of tax evasion, settled in the quiet town, far out west.

It is then that they became members of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (RSE).

The
 RSE was established by female leader J.Z. Knight, a business school 
drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico, who claims to channel messages from a
 35,000-year-old warrior.

Her spiritual method claims to bring 
together ancient wisdom with the power of consciousness and the latest 
scientific discoveries.

Ms Knight, (the J.Z. stands for Judy Zebra),
 a 68-year-old who has three marriages under her belt, holds retreats 
for her followers on private land attached to her French chateau-style 
mansion.

In 2007, her business filed profits of $2.6million from retreats, books, CDs and DVD sales.

A
 former business partner of the Nemes, Doug McCrea, told MailOnline last 
month that despite being evidently very wealth, the couple were quiet 
and unassuming. 

He
 said occasionally the couple came for a glass of wine at his bar but 
kept to themselves. He described Mrs Nemes as a 'petite blonde' who came
 across as a very nice person.

Court documents show that the Nemes also bought a home in Thurston 
County, and were allegedly in the process of building a lavish property on the grounds with the 
illegal funds, according to investigators.

They also owned a a 
restaurant and a large commercial property in Yelm.

The Ramtha method uses ancient wisdom and scientific developments, according to its followers

According to filings, Radu Nemes 
allegedly worked as part of a criminal gang to illegally import 1million
 tons of diesel fuel and sell it in Romania through shell companies 
between 2011 and 2012.

The shell companies were set up in names of homeless people to distance the Nemes from the fraud.

The massive tax dodge came by importing the fuel for manufacturing purposes then selling it directly to consumers.

Diana Nemes allegedly helped her 
husband by laundering money from the fuel scheme through Dubai accounts 
and then bringing it into the U.S.

A
 spokesman for the Ramtha school issued a statement to MailOnline in 
March saying the school 'has no information about allegations from the 
Romanian government or the student referenced'.

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which claims roots in the teachings of a 35,000-year-old warrior from a mystical land, was founded 26 years ago by a business school drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico.

JZ Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton in 1946) is the spiritual school's 'high priestess' after she claims that she was visited in 1977 by an entity named Ramtha, an ancient warrior who channels his teachings through her.

Ramtha, the 'Enlightened One', marries ancient wisdom with neuroscience and quantum physics to allow followers to access their own 'direct channel' with God.

Between 1979 and 1988, Knight traveled the U.S. having private 'dialogues' with students.

In 1988, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment was founded on former ranch land in Yelm, a small city in rural Washington state.

It is 
an 'academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of 
all ages and cultures', according to its official website

By 1995, Ramtha's school had an international reputation. J.Z. Knight was touring Australia, Italy, Japan and South Africa to spread her message of how students can use their brain power to 'Become a Remarkable Life'.

The school has a 80-acre fenced compound, not open to the public, which is the site of retreats for students and staff.

The 68-year-old religious guru's company, JZK Inc. posted profits of $2.6million in 2007 from these courses along with books, tapes and DVDs. 

In 2008, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment spread to 20 more countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile.

Ramtha's claims that more than 100,000 people globally have attended their spiritual events.
