Gennadji Raivich, whois facing jail for molesting a woman who used his insemination services

A ‘narcissistic’ academic who claims to have fathered 58 children as a  private sperm donor is facing jail for molesting a woman who used his services.

Professor Gennadij Raivich, 51, set up a ‘one-stop shop’ on the internet to artificially inseminate women who were desperate to start a family.

He visited them at home and pretended to be trying to help them, but instead he was ‘sexually motivated’ to embark upon a ‘breeding programme’, a court heard.

The neuroscientist, an expert in maternal and foetal medicine,  was found guilty of sexually assaulting one woman who used his services and was cleared of abusing two others.

Blackfriars Crown Court in South East London heard that Raivich advertised his services online under a false name and carried out home visits around the country.

He carried a ‘donation kit’ with him containing a DVD player so he could watch pornography, rubber gloves and laboratory equipment.

But he was arrested after three women complained that he had sexually assaulted them. Raivich, who worked at University College, London, once gave an interview in which he described being a sperm donor as ‘like a hobby or charitable act’ and said that he got ‘satisfaction by helping’.

He also said that he offered his services as a donor and as a doctor because he ‘loved children’ and wanted others to enjoy parenthood. Tom Wilkins, prosecuting, told jurors: ‘You have to ask yourselves what kind of woman agrees to meet a complete stranger for artificial insemination: Someone who is desperate and is prepared to put up with the potential embarrassment and humiliation and who has kept the details from their friends and families.

‘A perfect victim for sexual assault, someone unlikely to complain.

‘Compare the women to this defendant, someone who has traded on the fact he is a doctor and paraded his scientific knowledge, impressing them with his apparent expertise. What kind of man embarks on a breeding  programme to have as many  children as possible?

‘You may feel there is a high degree of narcissism in what he  has done and that he is sexually motivated in some of these transactions.’

His victim told the court that Raivich had visited her at home after she contacted him.

She said she went along with his request for her to perform a sex act on him on several occasions because she had been trying to conceive for a year and was desperate for success this time.

Mr Wilkins said he sexually assaulted her, adding: ‘She told him three or four times not to touch her, but he went ahead regardless.

‘He was not the altruistic  donor, but someone who is sexually motivated.’

Raivich, of North London, was convicted of two counts of sexually assaulting the woman and was released on bail until September 30 for a pre-sentence report.

Two other women, both 26-year-old lesbians, also told the court the defendant abused them – which he denied, but the jury were unable to reach verdicts on this.

Raivich is a qualified doctor in Germany, but has never practised medicine and is not registered with the General Medical Council.

Following his arrest, 15 women who had children by him came to his defence, including a police officer, a maths teacher and a lecturer.

His conviction on June 27 could not be reported until now because the Crown Prosecution Service was considering a retrial over eight charges relating to alleged assaults on the lesbians, but it has now decided not to proceed.
