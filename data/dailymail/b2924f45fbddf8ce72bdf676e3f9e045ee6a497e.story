The Duchess of Cornwall has been forced to cancel a number of engagements this week after developing a severe ear infection and sinusitis, Clarence House said today.

Camilla was due to attend the Classical Brit Awards at the Royal Albert Hall tonight and a series of events in London tomorrow but will now miss them because of illness.

It is thought the Duchess has sought medical advice and been advised not to fly down from Scotland where she has been spending the summer with the Prince of Wales.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'The 
Duchess of Cornwall has developed sinusitis and a severe middle ear 
infection over the last few days, which means she will not be able to 
carry out her engagements in London this evening and tomorrow.'

The Duchess is understood to be very disappointed at missing her engagements this week.

Camilla was due to celebrate National Community Meals Week at a hospitality and catering college in central London tomorrow.

She was then expected to travel to Clarence House to honour Madeline Mason, who has been named a Diamond Champion for her work as a volunteer with the charity Guide Dogs, and that evening attend the charity screening of the First World War film Private Peaceful.

It is hoped that some of the events can be rescheduled for a later date.
