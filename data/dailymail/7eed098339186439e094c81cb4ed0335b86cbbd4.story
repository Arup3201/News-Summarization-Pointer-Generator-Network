A cheap form of IVF that uses baking soda is to be trialled in Britain next month.

It costs a third of the price of standard treatment as it does not involve costly drugs and equipment.

In conventional IVF, the embryo is grown a mixture of nutrients in a large incubator with expensive carbon dioxide pumped through.

A revolutionary IVF, called simplifed culture system and costs £1,000, will be trialled in Britain next month

But scientists from Colorado University in America found they could get the same effect using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate – baking soda.

This enables the embryo to be grown in a far smaller incubator the size of a shoe box.

The technique – called simplified culture system – has already resulted in the birth of 18 healthy babies in Belgium.

As part of the trial next month, 50 British women under the age of 37 will pay £1,000 to undergo the procedure.

The treatment will initially only be available privately but doctors hope that if successful, it will eventually be offered on the NHS.

Standard IVF costs at least £3,000 meaning this version is a third of the price.

Scientists found baking soda - or sodium bicarbonate - created same effect as conventional IVF methods

Dr Geeta Nargund, director of the Walking Egg Foundation, the charity overseeing it, said: ‘The initial focus was to develop a simplified low-cost procedure to provide IVF in the developing world.

‘However, the public funding for IVF in the UK is very limited and by reducing costs significantly through this method we can offer a realistic opportunity to end the current postcode lottery because more cycles could be offered within the existing NHS budget constraints.’

The trial in Belgium showed that the procedure had the same success rates of conventional IVF - about 34 per cent.

It has led to the births of 18 babies and six women are pregnant.

In the paper, published in March, lead researcher Professor Jonathan Van Blerkom wrote: ‘While the demand for IVF has shown no diminution since its formal introduction nearly 35 years ago, neither have treatment costs, which have progressively increased.’
