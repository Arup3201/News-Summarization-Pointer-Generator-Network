It's an estate that would give neighbors like Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres a serious run for their money, or perhaps just some envy by proximity.

And with a price tag of $125 million, it would want to.

Welcome to Rancho San Carlos, a 237-acre mega-property that has just been listed in Montecito, the wealthiest and most celebrity-laden suburb in Santa Barbara county.

Owned by the same family for the last 90 years, the expansive manor and its features - including 10 cottages, an English-style pub, barn and stable, outdoor stable and covered horse riding arena - is what real estate agents Suzanne Perkins and Harry Kolb of Sotheby's International Realty describe as 'one of a kind'.

Bargain: For $125 million, this 237-acre mega-property in the well-to-do California area of Montecito, could be all yours

Californian colonial: The main house is built around a courtyard and features a secret tower office (top right) that can only be accessed via the master suite

Expansive: With mountain and ocean views, the 237-acre grounds feature over 100 orchards of avocado and citrus orchards

Classic: While expertly maintained, the home has been used as a full-time residence since 1990 and has become too difficult to look after

Bonus: Accessed by a secret Prohibition-era door, the home comes with its own English-style pub

Rancher and property investor Charles H. Jackson, Jr. and his wife, Ann, bought the land in the late 1920s and built the main house, which has since been expanded to a 30,000 square-foot mansion, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The Jackson family took over the estate following the death of the couple, with the house not being used as a full-time residence since 1990.

The family, now spread all over the country, have finally decided to sell, with the mammoth grounds becoming too difficult to maintain.

The Alta California-style house is built around a courtyard and has 12 bedrooms and 10 full and three half bathrooms.

The pub is located by a hidden door on the bottom level.

Some 10 separate cottages - which were typically used to house staff and guests - dot the land, which features about 100 acres of citrus and avocado orchards.

The Jackson's bred polo and race horses as well as dogs on the property, so there is a barn and stable, outdoor paddocks, a 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena and an outdoor training track, according to The Wall Street Journal.

There is also a secret tower office that can only be accessed by an exterior set of stairs attached to the master bedroom.

'It's almost like a small city,' Mr. Kolb told The Journal.

Comfortable: With the main house measuring 30,00 square-feet, there is plenty of space

Stable: Keen polo players, the long-time owners built major equestrian facilities into the property

Horse friendly: At one time there were 30 horses on the land, with the equestrian facilities more than up to scratch

Space: There are numerous paddocks as well on the land
