A freshman Republican representative said Wednesday that August 1, the day contraception coverage goes into effect, is one of the darkest days in modern American history, likening it to the attacks on Pearl Harbour and the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Rep Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania) said that America was under attack with the mandate, saying: ‘I know in your mind you can think of times when America was attacked. One is December 7th, that’s Pearl Harbour. The other is September 11th, and that’s the day of the terrorist attack.’

He continued: ‘I want you to remember August the 1st, 2012, the attack on our religious freedom. That is a day that will live in infamy, along with those other dates.’

Anger: Rep. Mike Kelly spoke at the GOP Freshman Class Press Conference Wednesday at at Capitol Hill, likening the birth control mandate to Pearl Harbour and 9/11

Rep Kelly, who is an outspoken supporter for the pro-life movement, made the apocalyptic comparison on Capitol Hill Wednesday. NBC News originally reported the Republican’s angry reaction to the mandate going into effect.

He also called it ‘religious bigotry.’

Rep Billy Long (R-Missouri) agreed with his fellow Republican, caustically throwing out more thoughts against the HHS mandate. ‘We’re not in the land of the free anymore,’ he said, ‘and we need to get that straight.’

A spokesperson to Rep Kelly’s office did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment.

The issue of birth control has been a hot topic in Washington and across the country, with Democrats and Republicans often seeing dramatically different views.

Aside from the partisan debate, many Catholic leaders in many different dioceses rallied against the Obama administration’s health care reform.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York wrote a letter to the president in February saying the law ‘does not meet our standard of respecting the religious liberty and moral convictions of all stakeholders in the health coverage transition.

The new law requires employers – including those in religious organisations – to provide health insurance plans that in turn offer free contraception to their workers, something that many religious leaders find contradictory to their beliefs.

Taking control: With the mandate going into law, non-exempt employers must provide insurance which in turn must provide birth control with no co-pays

President Obama signed the historic heath care reform bill into law in March of 2010.

TPM notes that Rep Kelly’s fuming response to the bill’s passing is not the only one from a Republican representative.

'I know you can think of
times when America was attacked. One is Pearl 
Harbour. The other is 9/11. I want you to remember August the 1st, 2012, the attack on 
our religious freedom. That is a day that will live in infamy.'

Earlier this summer, Rep Mike Pence (R-Indiana) compared the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the health care law to September 11, according to several Politico sources.

Immediately after making the comment, Rep Pence issued a statement saying: ‘My remarks at the Republican Conference following the Supreme Court decision were thoughtless. I certainly did not intend to minimize any tragedy our nation has faced and I apologise.’

As of Wednesday night, Rep Kelly had not offered an apology for his statements earlier in the day. Those infuriated by his comments took to his Facebook page.

One user wrote: ‘How embarrassing for our country. I think the congressmen ought to think carefully… then think again before he sprouts this fundamentalist garbage while wrapping himself in our flag.’

The freshman representative has already been blasted by Hawaiian Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who is a veteran of World War II. 

He wrote: ‘I witnessed the attack on Pearl Harbour and had the privilege of serving in the United States Army during World War II and I find the comments made by the Congressman from Pennsylvania to be misguided and insulting. 

‘It is complete nonsense to suggest that a matter discussed, debated, and approved by the Congress and the President is akin to a surprise attack that killed nearly 2,500 people and launched our nation into the second World War or a terrorist attack that left nearly 3,000 dead and led to fighting and dying in Afghanistan and Iraq.’
