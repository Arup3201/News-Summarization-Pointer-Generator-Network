A hit-and-run driver who killed a father and his beloved dog while they went for a morning walk has been jailed for four years. 

Joshua Butler, 22, hit Stuart Blackwell, 40, and his faithful labrador Oscar as they walked along the pavement in Lichfield, Staffordshire, before driving off.

Mr Blackwell was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.

His wife Clare today said he was a devoted father to their eight-year-old daughter.

Butler, from Lichfield, handed himself 
in to police the following morning where he was charged with causing 
death by dangerous driving and failing to stop.

He pleaded guilty to both charges and was today sentenced at Stafford Crown Court.

DC Andy Weatherley, from 
Staffordshire Police, said: 'Mr Blackwell was a responsible dog walker 
who took the same route at the same time every week day for eight 
years.

'His wife and daughter always expected him to return home and when he didn't it was the worst news they could ever receive.

'Butler's car mounted the pavement 
and hit Stuart and Oscar before Butler left the scene.

'He is now in prison which will, 
hopefully, bring some closure for Stuart's family as they continue to 
mourn his tragic and unnecessary loss.'

Mr Blackwell's wife Clare, 39, said: 'Making an early guilty plea was the one thing Mr Butler
could do which will allow our family to begin to face our future 
without my husband, Stuart. 

'I believe this decision took bravery
and compassion and I was glad to see that Mr Butler had the support of 
his family in court.

'A custodial sentence will not bring 
Stuart and Oscar home from their walk but I very much hope it will deter
other drivers from making irresponsible choices in the future.

'As the legal process draws to a 
close, my daughter and I can begin to grieve for our loss and remember 
Stuart as a caring, fun-loving, devoted daddy and husband.'
