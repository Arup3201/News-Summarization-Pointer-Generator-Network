David Cameron will travel to Paris on Sunday to attend a 'unity rally' with other world leaders following the spate terror attacks which have rocked France over the last three days.

The Prime Minister said he had accepted an invitation from President Hollande to celebrate 'the values behind Charlie Hebdo'. 

It comes after French commandos simultaneously stormed a grocery store in Paris and printing firm outside the capital where three terrorists were  holed up - killing all the Al Qaeda fanatics.

The 'unity rally' is set to take place at around 3pm on Sunday at the Place de la Republique in central Paris.

Mr Cameron and other world leaders will go to the Elysee Palace first, before joining the rally. 

Mr Cameron's decision to attend the rally on Sunday comes after security chiefs warned that Britain was also being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists.

MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK.

Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists.

Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain.

He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain.

But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later.

He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. 

In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.'

Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. 

In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed.

He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness.

'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year.

'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq.

'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in.

'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.'

Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months.

Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car.

Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect.

At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said.

Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. 

Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK.

'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf.

'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.'

'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely.

'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.'

Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks.

He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen.

'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks.

'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'

There is also growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS fights returning to the UK.

Radicalisation expert Shiraz Maher this morning told the BBC's Today programme that strict blasphemy laws in Muslim countries abroad were inflaming tensions in the West.

He said stricter controls on what could be said about Islam and the prophet Muhammad 'affect some European Muslim's tolerance of satire'.

Earlier, the Today programme heard from a number of British Muslims in High Wycombe who expressed anger at the journalists Charlie Hebdo for lampooning Islam.

One Pakistani gentleman, Sajjad Haidyer, told the programme that the murdered journalists were 'not innocent'.

He said: 'If the people make his cartoons or something else, they are hurting my heart. You can insult the peoples, you can insult me, you can insult anybody else – but not god, not the prophet Muhammad – we are not allowing that.

'If they are doing that, that will happen again and again.'

He added: 'Some of these people were not innocent. The editor who makes the cartoons. He has no right to make cartoons or the prophet. He has no right to say Islam is bad.'

Another elderly Muslim man said: 'Democracy doesn't mean you can go and insult anybody. Insulting somebody, you shouldn't allow that. What are they achieving with the cartoon – what is the point?'

But another man in the town said people did not have the right to take people lives. 'What Islam means is peace, love,' he said.

Prince Harry has paid his respects to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre by signing a book of condolence at the French embassy.

Harry added his name to a growing list of signatures from leading figures who have expressed sympathy for the 12 people gunned down by attackers who targeted a satirical magazine based in Paris.

London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May have already signed the book set up at the embassy in London for national figures.

Members of the public have been leaving messages of support in another book opened at the French Institute.

When Harry first arrived at the embassy in Knightsbridge he was greeted by Sylvie Bermann, France's ambassador to the UK.

Ms Bermann ushered him in to a room where the book of condolence was opened on a large table next to colour photographs of all the victims.

The table also displayed the slogan Je suis Charlie, adopted worldwide by supporters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and a bouquet of roses left by the London Mayor.

Harry, dressed in a suit and tie, wrote the brief message 'With warmest best wishes' above his name.

As the prince and the ambassador left the room, they chatted briefly, and in a possible reference to the two Islamist militants suspected of the Charlie Hebdo attack who are holed up in a building outside Paris, Harry said: 'I'm sure it will come to an end soon.'

The Queen has already sent a message of condolence to France's president Francois Hollande in which she expressed her 'sincere condolences' to the families of those who were killed in the attack.

After the prince left, the ambassador said: 'For us, it's very important to have the support of the Royal Family.

'We were very moved by the support of Her Majesty the Queen and then the prince. It shows the solidarity of the British people and British Government and Royal Family (with us).'
