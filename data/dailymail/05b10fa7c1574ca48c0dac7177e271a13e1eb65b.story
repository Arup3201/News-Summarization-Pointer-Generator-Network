Lucky: Rebecca Chew, 18, was working at a seaside cafe in Polkerris, Cornwall, when Richard Curtis popped in for dinner with his family

A teenage waitress was given a slice of luck when she was offered a part in a new Richard Curtis film after serving the film directer pizza.  

Rebecca Chew, 18, was working at a seaside cafe in Polkerris, Cornwall, when the Four Weddings and a Funeral writer popped in for dinner with his family.

She did not recognise the famous diner, who was in the area to film scenes for his new movie, About Time.

Miss Chew served the family pizza and thought nothing more of last summer's encounter until a month later when she received a call from an assistant director.

He explained that Curtis was on the lookout for someone to play a waitress in the time-travelling comedy and was so impressed with the teenager he wanted her for the part.

Thrilled Rebecca was sunbathing in Mallorca when she took the call, having just finished a diploma in singing while working at Sam's On The Beach restaurant.

After accepting the role, Rebecca joined Hollywood stars including Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams on set.

She said: 'I was on holiday so it was all very surreal. The assistant director called me up and said Richard Curtis would like me to play a small part in the film.

'I was in shock. I think he must just have seen me at Sam's on the Beach and thought I might fit the role.

'It was a massive surprise. It's quite an honour really and I love his films, like Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral.

'I'd heard rumours about him filming 
in Cornwall but when he came in with his family I didn't recognise him 
at first. I'm just a Cornish girl - this isn't something you expect to 
happen.

'Rachel McAdams came in later in the evening so the pizza must have gone down well.'

Miss
Chew described filming her scene, in which she serves a sandwich to one
of the film's stars, Domhnall Gleeson, in a cafe as 'very 
nerve-racking'.

She hopes that catching Curtis' eye will help her launch a career in musical theatre.

She
said: 'He certainly wouldn't be a bad contact to have. There were quite
a few takes but I don't think that it was because I did anything wrong.

'I hadn't done anything like this since school plays, and usually I was just a backing dancer or something.'

Miss Chew returned to Cornwall over the weekend for the premier of the About Time, which opened in cinemas. 

The
film follows the adventures of Gleeson's character, Tim, who discovers 
he can travel in time and change what has happened in his own life.

He uses his powers to romance Mary, who he meets after moving to London to train as a lawyer.

Speaking at the glitzy showbiz event in St Austell, Curtis lavished praise on Miss Chew's waitressing skills.

He said: 'She was so sweet when she was giving pizzas to our kids that we cast her in the film and she came up and acted a crucial part of a waitress in Pret A Manger.

'This was just typical of the reception we received - people were so nice that we wanted to take them with us.'
