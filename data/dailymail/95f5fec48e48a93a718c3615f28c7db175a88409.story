A British teenager died after falling from the ninth floor of a hotel in Spain – minutes after being told to get off the fire escape.

Tom Ousby, 19, was said to have ignored a warning from a maintenance man who told him to get down from the outside stairway.

He then slipped and fell more than 60ft, landing on a wall.

Paramedics rushed to the four-star 
hotel in Magaluf, Majorca, and battled for an hour to save the teenager.
 But he had suffered catastrophic injuries and was later pronounced 
dead.

An aspiring model and musician Tom, 
19, of Uxbridge, north-west London, had told friends he was promoting 
bars and boat trips at the Spanish party resort.

He had been in Majorca for several 
weeks, tweeting in June: ‘Crazy times, haha! It’s all good, selling 
tickets for bar crawls and boat parties.’

Tom, who was said to have been 
staying at another hotel, is thought to have been out on Thursday and 
was trying to get into the hotel to see a friend when he fell.

Fall: A spokesman for the Atlantic Park hotel in Magaluf, where the incident is reported to have happened, refused to comment

A Civil Guard officer said a maintenance worker had spoken to the teenager.

He added: ‘He went inside the hotel shortly after telling the lad not to use the emergency stairway and didn’t see him again.’

Spanish police are said to be 
investigating the death, which  they are treating as a tragic accident. 
In the days before his death Tom had spoken online about returning 
Britain.

He told friends on Twitter: ‘Magas 
[sic] all good, coming home sometime this week though.’ Tributes were 
left on the website, including a picture of his name spelt out in 
tea-light candles.

'I truly adore him and cannot understand why he's not here'

Danielle McCabe, friend

Tom lived with his parents, John and 
Yvonne Ousby. He had hopes of being a drummer and an actor and had 
worked as a model for Marks & Spencer as a child.

Lily Delphine, 18, a film student 
from London, wrote on Twitter: ‘I wish we were all together again,’ 
adding, ‘On the balcony with everyone, having a cheeky drink and 
listening to Tom’s iPod’.

Danielle McCabe tweeted: ‘Thomas William Ousby has the most amazing energy I’ve ever met in a person.

‘I truly adore him and cannot understand why he’s not here.’

Another friend, Chelsie Louise,  
tweeted: ‘Delighted I got the privilege to meet such an outstanding 
genuinely happy guy and call him a friend.’

A YouTube video of Tom Ousby playing drums to Taylor Swift’s song 22 has been watched more than 9,000 times.

The Atlantic Park hotel in Magaluf, where the incident is reported to have happened, declined to comment.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We 
were notified on August 3 of the death of a British national in Spain 
and are providing consular assistance to the family at this time.’

The teenager is the fifth Briton to die in a hotel fall in little over a year.
