They're a group of enthusiastic young girls who have always wanted to be cheerleaders but, due to assorted medical ailments, would never actually qualify for a proper team.

But now they have their own.

A gym in Tyler, Texas, is offering a creative new charity program for kids in the area by forming a special needs cheerleading squad, according to KETK.

Their name? Team Inspire.

Team Inspire: The new cheer squad, formed for children with special needs at the Gym Tyler in Texas, watch on as another squad performs

Active: At the moment the team is made up of about 15 enthusiastic girls, but boys are welcome too

Open arms: Everyone is welcome to join the team

Alot of people have got involved to help the children learn the cheer routine

'I am excited': Ava Penkilo, 8, is one of the girl's on Team Inspire

Motivated:  Team Inspire, a group of cheerleaders with special needs, will start practice at Johnson's gym in September. So far, about 15 cheerleaders are interested in the program

The owner of GymTyler Gymnastics, Kim Johnson, said the idea came about in February, when a one-off squad was created for the developmentally challenged.

The team performed a two and a half minute routine at a University of Texas at Tyler basketball game.

'It was so awesome and overwhelming,' Johnson told the Tyler Morning Telegraph.

'I really think God reached down and said, ''this is what we are doing''.'

Johnson then set out on a fundraising effort in order to collect enough money so the squad could become a permanent part of her gym.

While raising a cheerleader will usually set parents back anywhere between $1,500 to $5,000 a year, the cost to join the Team Inspire is $15 a month.

Cheering: The cost for the children joining Team Inspire will be just $15 per month following a fundraiser

Ready, ok: Gym owner Kim Johnson (back left) said she wanted to launch the cheer program for years

Some of the loudest cheers aren't coming from the girls, but from their supporters, especially the other girls that help out among the group

That money will be used for team parties and for uniforms.

Some of the children involved have Down syndrome, while one girl, Stevena Pate, 7, suffers from Prader-Willi syndrome â€” a rare genetic condition characterized by constant hunger and an inability to feel full.

Stevena loves music, dancing and singing, according to her grandmother, Debbie Pate.

The squad have already started learning their routine, with the first verse: 'GymTyler, the show has took to the floor. Inspiring the world, we are here to rock the floor.'

The gym is raising money to include more children on the team and help out parents with costs.

An account is set up for donations at Prosperity Bank under Twisters Inspire.
