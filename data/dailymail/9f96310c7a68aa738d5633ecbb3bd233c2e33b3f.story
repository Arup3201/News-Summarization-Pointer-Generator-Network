The Ebola survivor whose dog was put down over fears it could have the killer disease has adopted a new puppy, it was revealed today.

Nurse Teresa Romero’s beloved pet Excalibur was sacrificed in October despite a public outcry that saw protesters clash with riot police outside her home in Alcorcon, Spain, as it was taken away.

The 44-year-old health worker described the dog as being like a child to her and announced she would fight for compensation through the courts after winning her battle for life.

But yesterday she took home an American Stafford puppy called Alma - Spanish for Soul. Mrs Romero and husband Javier Limon adopted the dog from an animal protection centre in Alcorcon.

Mr Limon had attacked health chiefs for putting Excalibur down while he and his wife were in quarantine in a Madrid hospital.

But he said as they picked up their new pet: ‘We’ve come here to adopt Alma and we want society to realise there are many abandoned animals that need a new home.’

Mrs Romero added: ‘I’d like it if our idea of adopting a dog could serve as an example so these animals can have a family like Alma and be happy.’

Authorities obtained a court order to enter the couple’s home and take Excalibur away while Mrs Romero, the first person to contract Ebola outside of West Africa, was battling the disease and her husband was being kept in isolation as a precaution.

The nurse fell ill days after cleaning the room of Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo who died from Ebola in September after being flown back from West Africa for treatment.

She was released from hospital at the start of November after being treated with blood plasma from an Ebola survivor. Around 400,000 people signed a petition calling for Excalibur to be saved.

Mr Limon wrote a letter to Excalibur a week after he was put to sleep, telling his pet: ‘Bad people without feelings took you away’ and promising to ‘seek justice’.

Teresa later announced she was demanding €150,000 euros (£112,000) compensation for the sacrifice of her dog.

Lawyers for the Spanish nurse claimed the decision to put the animal down was ‘improvised and taken against medical advice’.

Yesterday it emerged British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, 39, had left hospital in London after making a complete recovery from Ebola. 

She caught the disease while volunteering in Sierra Leone.

The current Ebola epidemic is believed to have started in December 2013 with an infected fruit bat in a forested area of Guinea.

The World Health Organisation said in its latest update on the epidemic - the worst the world has ever seen - that 8,688 people had died.

It said the crisis was still ‘extremely alarming’ although the UN said yesterday that Liberia, one of the worst-affected countries, was dealing with just five remaining cases of the disease.
