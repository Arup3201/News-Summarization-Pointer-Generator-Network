Tasteless: Kate Winslet stars in Movie 43, the first comedy produced by Sir Richard Branson's film studio Virgin Produced

Not since she dallied on the deck of the Titantic with Leonardo DiCaprio has Kate Winslet had a screen role so ill-fated.

But while James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster made the British actress a superstar, she must be hoping her latest film follows in the wake of the doomed ship, and sinks without trace.

For Movie 43 — the first comedy produced by Sir Richard Branson’s film studio Virgin Produced — is a Hollywood movie so unremittingly awful that it had to be sneaked out on an unsuspecting public before critics could see it and warn them.

But now that they’ve seen the final edit and reached for the tranquillisers (if not a revolver), it’s hard to imagine they would dream of encouraging anyone to actually see it.

Even the famously publicity-hungry Sir Richard has gone suddenly quiet after hailing the film on his blog last week — then saying he hoped ‘the most outrageous comedy ever made … will put a smile on your face’. If only.

Last year, Winslet, 37, saved Branson’s elderly mother from a house fire on his Caribbean island of Necker, and the actress recently married his nephew Ned RocknRoll.

Branson has now rewarded the Oscar-winner by forever linking her with a film that tries to get laughs from a woman’s scatological sexual preferences, a teenager’s first menstruation, a woman who uses her breasts to stir guacamole, and a man whose testicles dangle from his throat. There’s more, but it’s not printable.

As Hollywood shakes its head and wonders whatever possessed so many stars to get involved in such barrel-scraping sleaze, many of America’s top critics believe they may have witnessed  cinematic history.

Quite simply, Movie 43 — now on general release in Britain — could be the worst film ever made.

The reviews, which are far more entertaining than the actual film, don’t pull any punches. Respected U.S. critic Richard Roeper describes it as the ‘Citizen Kane of awful’. Most of his colleagues struggle to remember another film so dire. The ‘gross-out’ humour of defecation, perverted sex, cruelty and rampant political incorrectness isn’t even funny or original, they complain.

But the general dismay at how low the standards of taste have sunk is matched by sheer bewilderment at how the film ever came to be made. As one New York critic put it: ‘Was someone holding Kate Winslet’s children hostage? Did Richard Gere or Hugh Jackman have gambling debts?’

Worst film ever? Director Peter Farrelly (right) has has told critics, who complain Hollywood never does anything new but 'flip out' when they get it, to 'lighten up'

If the cast had done it for the money, one might have understood. But insiders say it was produced on a shoestring, with its stars agreeing to be paid the union minimum rates of around $800 (around £500) a day. The entire film cost a lean $6 million (and amazingly recouped almost all that in its opening weekend in the U.S.).

Its main director, Peter Farrelly, was responsible for the popular, if obscene, Nineties comedies Dumb & Dumber and There’s Something About Mary. Stung by the abuse about Movie 43, he has tweeted to critics: ‘You always complain that Hollywood never gives you new stuff, and then when you get it, you flip out. Lighten up.’

The ‘comedy’ — and the term has perhaps never been more loosely used — is composed of a dozen short films or sketches linked by a flimsy plotline.

I watched it in an almost empty New York cinema this week. The only other occupant walked out after ten minutes. The sketches that drove her away included the first, in which Winslet goes on a blind date with Hugh Jackman — star of Les Miserables and X-Men. Here he plays a successful lawyer whose only flaw is a pair of testicles hanging from his throat.

Apparently, Winslet is the only person in the restaurant who notices anything amiss.

The next skit continues in the same taste-free vein with A-list actress Naomi Watts and Golden Globe-nominated actor Liev Schreiber playing parents who home-school their teenage son.

Determined to give him the full high-school experience, especially with sex, his father propositions him while his mother ends up French-kissing him.

Later on, Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant — who wrote The Office with Ricky Gervais — go on a date in which they play truth or dare. Oscar-winning Berry ends up stirring guacamole with what’s clearly a prosthetic breast.

Some of the sketches are even more disgusting. In one, a young woman wants her fiancé to do something unspeakable to her. In a second, actress Elizabeth Banks is drenched with cat urine from her boyfriend’s jealous pet, and ripped to pieces by children.

Her fate is marginally better than the foul-mouthed leprechaun played by British action star Gerard Butler, who is tortured and murdered by two friends trying to get their hands on his pot of gold.

So how did this glittering piece of movie-making history make it to the screen? Its producer, Charles Wessler, claims he came up with the idea 15 years ago. But various directors pulled out, and his actor of choice, George Clooney, refused point-blank to play a man unable to chat up women.

But four years ago the film finally took flight when Wessler met Hugh Jackman at a wedding and he later agreed to do it.

Astonishingly, Winslet also liked the script. The sketch featuring her and Jackman was then used to persuade a Hollywood studio, Relativity Media, to distribute the movie. And insiders say the producers and director called in a lot of favours from actor friends.

Sir Richard Branson last week boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he'd watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life

The fact each role only took a few days to film helped their cause. And some of the ‘serious’ actors said they wanted to try their hand at risqué comedy any-way. In fact, director Farrelly insisted that all the stars ‘wanted to push it further’, although it is far from clear how they could have sunk even lower.

The film took nearly four years to make because production had to fit in with the cast’s other filming commitments. The producers admitted the actors weren’t ‘completely aware’ of the other sketches, and few bothered to ask. ‘They were attracted to their script, and as long as that tickled their funnybone, that was enough,’ said co-producer John Penotti.

Friends of Winslet have defended her decision to take part, saying she spent only a few days filming it, and pointing out that she clearly wasn’t the only star who thought the script was funny.

‘Not everything turns out as well as it looks on the printed page,’ said one.

Insiders insisted that she agreed to appear in the film before her romance began with Ned, whom she secretly married in New York.

That aside, there are rumours in Hollywood that many of Movie 43’s stars are regretting their involvement. The thought of being associated with the most derided film in Hollywood history must be utterly galling.

Last week, Sir Richard boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he’d watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life. ‘I think it’s a Virgin film, which makes total sense,’ this businessman apparently added. ‘That crazy Brit is taking over the world!’

One wonders whether Sir Richard feels so all-conquering now. Unless, of course, it was always the plan to add ‘world’s most unwatchable movie disaster’ to his list of achievements.

Movie 43’s provocative tagline is: ‘Once you see it, you can’t unsee it.’ There’s a simple solution to that conundrum, and it’s one that a small army of humbled Hollywood stars are praying you take: don’t see it.
