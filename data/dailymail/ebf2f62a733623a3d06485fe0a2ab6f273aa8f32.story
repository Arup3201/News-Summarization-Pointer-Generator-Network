More than £3.5billion has been lost in benefit fraud and error, despite David Cameron’s promise of an ‘uncompromising’ crackdown.

Repeated announcements about efforts to catch welfare cheats and curb bungling by officials have led to no change in the amount of money lost.

In fact, since the coalition came to power in 2010 the amount of cash written off has risen by £300million.

Official figures show how fraud and error has risen in cash terms, and as a proportion of the total welfare bill has remained flat at 2.1 per cent since the coalition was formed

Today the Department for Work and Pensions insisted it was ‘fixing the welfare system’

But the National Audit Office has warned that the scale of the losses – up by more than 9 per cent in a last year – are ‘unacceptable’.

Of the £3.5billion lost last year, £1.2billion was the result of fraud, £1.6billion was attributed to error by benefits claimants and £800million was lost by officials paying out too much.

In 2010-11, the first year of the coalition, £3.2billion was lost in fraud and error, leading Mr Cameron to promise a ‘tough and uncompromising’ strategy to deal with the problem.

In August 2010 he said: ‘We will not shrug our shoulders and let them get away with it any longer.

‘We will take the necessary measures to stop fraud happening in the first place; root out and take tough action against those found committing fraud; and make sure the stolen money is paid back.’

But losses have risen every year in cash terms, and still accounts for 2.1 per cent of the total welfare budget, down slightly on the 2.2 per cent seen in 2009-10.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan smith was tasked by David Cameron with tackling fraud and error

Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary of Rachel Reeves said: 'David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith have repeatedly promised to catch down on fraud and error in the benefits system, yet on the latest figures from government show the value of overpayments by the DWP rising, not falling, on their watch.  

'Some £3.5 billion has been overpaid in benefits in the last year and millions have been written off on their flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. Ministers talk tough on benefits, but are not acting. It's time for them to get a grip of fraud and error.'

Figures released today show that in 2012-13 £1.32billion was lost through almost £500million from Pension Credit, £250million in Disability Living Allowance and £230million in Income Support.

Council Tax Benefit accounted for £230million, Jobseeker's Allowance £210million, Carer's Allowance £110million, the State Pension £90million and Incapacity Benefit £80million.

Welfare minister Lord Freud said: ‘We are fixing the welfare system to stop errors and ensuring investigators have the resources to catch cheats.

‘The level of fraud and error in the benefits system is lower than three years ago, and only a small minority commit fraud, but we are determined to continue the battle. This year we expect a record number of prosecutions.

‘The public play a vital role in our efforts to crack down on benefit fraud and error. We urge anyone who suspects someone of cheating the system to report this to the benefit fraud hotline.’

Last month the NAO refused to sign of the department’s accounts because of the scale of the problem.

In 2012-13 a total of £1.2billion was lost in fraud overpayments, including £800million in benefits handed out by the DWP and a further £400million lost in payments made by local councils.

In 2011-12 the figure was £1.1billion, still markedly up on £800million in 2007-08.

Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support and Pension Credit were most likely to be used to con the taxpayer out of money, the NAO said, because ‘they require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in order to establish entitlement to benefit’.

The biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living with a partner, or lying about income levels and working cash in hand.

NAO chief Amyas Morse ‘qualified’ the DWP accounts as a result of fraud and error which it was said remains ‘unacceptably high’.

The accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988-89.
