Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razzak has cut short his vacation to the U.S. due to public outrage over pictures emerged showing him playing golf with President Barack Obama as more than 160,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Malaysia's worst-ever flooding.

Despite  cutting short his holiday, anger among those affected by the flooding has not eased amid accusations the government has been far too slow in responding to the crisis.

Both vacationing this week in Oahu, Hawaii, Obama and Najib teed off on Wednesday on a cloudy but balmy afternoon at a Marine Corps base, not far from where Obama is renting a home for his two-week stay.

The two leaders appeared at ease together, smiling and laughing in casual clothes as they sized up their shots.

'The president and Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia enjoyed golf together today,' a White House official said. 'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia.'

But while they golfed, thousands of people in Malaysia were forced to flee their homes amid widespread devastation.

Authorities have evacuated numerous villages and towns in five Malaysian states that were inundated following unusually strong torrential rains. The majority of these are now seeking shelter in schools, community halls and other relief centers, according to flood monitoring centers.

Najib's Facebook page, meanwhile, was inundated with messages urging him to return home as the flooding worsened.

He has now returned, cutting short his holiday by six days in an attempt to quell the growing public indignation and oversee the flooding response.

Even on holiday, he said he was in constant touch with disaster and relief officials, who were doing all they can to help victims.

'I am deeply concerned by the floods. I feel for the people who have lost their homes, and the families who have lost loved ones,' he said. 'I want to see the situation for myself and be with the people.' 

Najib arrived in Kelantan, which has the biggest problems among eight affected states, following his announcement of 500 million ringgit (£91.31million) will be spent to aid victims after the flood subsides, following an initial government allocation of 50 million ringgit two days ago.

He attended briefings with the National Security Council, the National Disaster Management and Relief Committee, state government and local emergency responders, a statement yesterday said.
