A Chinese construction worker who fell off a building site, breaking his arms and legs was forced to survive for a week by drinking his own urine. 

Yang Hsieh was working on a building site in Hunan province, central China, when he fell 65ft to the ground breaking his four limbs and his mobile phone.

Mr Hsieh had been finishing off a job on the site when he plunged over an unguarded edge, plummeting to the gound.

His colleagues assumed when he failed to show for work that he had quit and got a job elsewhere 

The unfortunate construction worker tried calling for help, but none of his colleagues could hear him. 

Worse still, when he failed to show up for work over the next six days, his friends assumed he had got a job elsewhere without telling them. 

Bulider Fai She, 32, said: 'At first we thought he was off sick. We tried calling him but the phone was constantly off and by day four we thought he must have found work somewhere else

'We had no idea he was lying on the ground below us.'

Luckily for the construction worker, Kang Chia, 47, could hear a noise from the building site and decided to investigate. 

Mr Hsieh, pictured, admitted he was forced to drink his own urine while for six days awaiting rescue

He said: 'I was walking my dog when I heard someone calling for help. I went over and saw him lying at the bottom of a pit.

'He looked in a very bad way.'

Mr Hsieh was rushed to hospital where doctors anticipate he will make a full recovery. 

Commenting on his ordeal, Mr Hsieh added: 'I had to drink my own urine for six days to stop myself dehydrating.'
