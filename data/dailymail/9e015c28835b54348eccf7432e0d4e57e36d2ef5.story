Football clubs across the country united to pay tribute to fallen troops ahead of Remembrance Sunday services by observing a minute's silence before matches kicked off at stadiums from St Mary's to Ibrox.

Premier League sides wore commemorative shirts featuring a poppy design at the front with the words '1914 - 2014 Football Remembers', while Championship side Millwall produced a special matchday programme and played in a one-off camouflage kit against Brentford.

Events were even more pronounced up north where Glasgow Rangers produced a fantastic 'tifo' card display as well as fans unfurling a banner bearing words from Robert Laurence Binyon’s poem ‘For the Fallen’.

All 20 Premier League clubs had banded together for the first time to support the Tickets for Troops campaign which provides free match day passes to members of the Armed Forces.

Free tickets have been offered to some soldiers to all of the November 8 and 9 top flight fixtures to mark Remembrance Weekend, including  Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunderland v Everton, Liverpool v Chelsea, Tottenham v Stoke and Swansea v Arsenal.

This year marks a particularly special landmark with the centenary of the First World War being commemorated.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'This is a very significant year in the history of our nation and football has had a prominent part in wartime, whether it was supporters and players volunteering to fight for their country or the famous football matches played in the trenches by soldiers from both sides during the Christmas Truce in 1914.'
