The World Cup may have ended miserably for England, but in just a few months Roy Hodgson's side have enjoyed a pleasant change in fortunes.

Having left Brazil 2014 without a victory, the Three Lions have now won their last five games including four Euro 2016 qualifiers.

England will now look to end the year with a sixth straight win as they travelled to Scotland to face 'the old enemy' in a friendly at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

Roy Hodgson was all smiles as he took an early look at the Celtic Park pitch - no doubt relieved that the recent football played on the surface was not of the American kind. 

The England players looked in good spirits ahead of flying out to Glasgow, with Arsenal forward Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain posting a picture on Instagram with team-mates while sitting on a shuttle bus waiting to be transferred to their flight.

England battled back from a goal down to win 3-1 in their last outing against Slovenia, a result which sees them top their Euro 2016 qualifying group by six points.

It leaves them in an excellent position to reach the finals in France.

But attention will now turn to the clash with Scotland, as England travel north of the border for the first time since Paul Scholes scored twice in a 2-0 win for the Three Lions in a Euro 2000 play-off in 1999.
