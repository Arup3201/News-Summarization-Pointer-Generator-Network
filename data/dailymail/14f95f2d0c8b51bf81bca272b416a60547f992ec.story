Five babies have tested positive for a tuberculosis infection after being exposed to the deadly disease by a nursery healthcare worker at an El Paso hospital.  

The newborn babies were exposed to TB by the unnamed employee who worked on the maternity ward at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso, Texas. 

At least 700 babies and 40 employees were placed at risk of contracting the disease between September 2013 and August 2014, according to the El Paso Department of Public Health.

Exposure: More than 700 babies and 40 employees at Providence Memorial Hospital were exposed to TB

Newborn: Parents of infants born between September 2013 and August 25 of this year were asked to come in for tests

However, officials said that the babies who tested positive do not have active TB which can destroy the lungs and be potentially fatal. 

Dr. Enrique Martinez told local TV station KVIA: 'These individuals [babies] do not have active tuberculosis. They are not sick. They are not contagious.'  

Four of the babies were given a vaccine called BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) that can generate false positives in this kind of testing according to the hospital, but all will be treated as a precaution.  

Last week, the El Paso Department of Public Health was given a list of babies who were exposed to TB and the department quickly notified their parents by mail, phone and e-mail.   

So far, 200 babies have undergone X-ray and skin tests, according to the health department.

Hospital officials said that they 'should have done more' when the employee's symptoms were revealed during her annual screening in July.

But at least 858 parents have received letters and phone calls asking them to come in for screening and that number will fluctuate as the investigation continues.

Parents with infants born between September 2013 and August 2014 - when the unnamed female nurse was put on leave after testing positive for tuberculosis - underwent screenings.

However hundreds of parents are still bringing their children in for testing, so that they can determine whether their babies have become infected. 

Update: A representative from Providence Memorial Hospital confirmed Saturday at a joint news conference five babies have tested positive for Tuberculosis infection

Department of Public Health: A spokesman said it's important to point out that the five children who tested positive are not considered to have the active TB

Robert Resendes, the Director of the El Paso Health Department, said that  they have the situation under control.

Resendes said: ‘This is nothing new, it just may be a little larger than we are used to dealing with but it is something we know how to deal with.’ 

Most of the babies who were exposed to TB are now in Mexico or New Mexico, according to The El Paso Times. 

TB infection is spread through coughs and sneezes of an infected individual, but can lay dormant for years before becoming active, according to health officials. 

There are an estimated 22,000 tuberculosis cases reported in the U.S. each year.
