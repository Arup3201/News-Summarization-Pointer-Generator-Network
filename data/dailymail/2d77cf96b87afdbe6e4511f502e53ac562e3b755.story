Glee star Jane Lynch is officially a single woman, after her divorce became final on Monday.

However, TMZ reports that Jane has had to pay her ex-wife - psychologist Dr. Lara Embry - a whopping $1.2 million in a property settlement spread over a two-year period.

The site reports that Embry is also entitled to a lot more, including half of Lynch's royalties from her hit show Glee, and other TV appearances.

She is also being granted $847, 485 - half of 'several bank and trust accounts' and keeping their dog Francis.

Lynch filed court documents in July to legally dissolve her three-year marriage to Embry, after splitting in February 2012.

The pair are said to have been on 'very civilized' terms with one another after coming to an agreement about their split.

Lynch previously insisted that her divorce was 'not a horrible thing' and friends explained the actress wanted to stay friends with Lara for the sake of her former spouse's 10-year-old daughter, Haden.

She said: 'It's not dramatic. It's not a horrible thing. It's something that we're dealing with. It's two people who just decided it's better to go apart than stay together.'

Not her little dog too! Jane has also given up her pooch Francis to her ex-wife 

However, it is unclear if Lynch will have a change of heart following the outcome of Monday's ruling.  

The pair got engaged in 2010 and married on Memorial Day in May the same year in an intimate ceremony in Sunderland, Massachusetts.

In a 2013 Lynch said in an interview with PopCrush that she expected to give a pay-out to Embry from some of her 'highest earning years.'

'[California] is a half and half state, as well as it should be, so that's fine ...It's just money.'

She added: 'I should be dating. I should... and I don't want to do any of those things.'
