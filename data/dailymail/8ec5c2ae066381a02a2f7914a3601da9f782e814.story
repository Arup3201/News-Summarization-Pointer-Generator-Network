Must-see: Banksy's naked man image in Bristol is on VisitEngland's 101 Things To Do In England

From eating a sizzling balti in Birmingham, to enjoying a night on the 'toon' in Newcastle or looking at Banksy's image of a naked man hanging from a Bristol window ledge, there is no better way to celebrate the best of England, according to tourism bosses.

These and other suggestions are included on VisitEngland's 'bucket list' of experiences to enjoy on these shores, before heading abroad for the summer.

The full list of 101 Things To Do In England will be revealed on Tuesday in time for St George's Day.

Unsurprisingly, Stonehenge, the Tower
of London and Buckingham Palace have made it onto the list, but so too 
have a host of unusual suggestions for the more adventurous tourist.

These include swinging through the Sherwood pines at Go Ape in 
Nottinghamshire, and searching for bats in the caves at Cheddar Gorge in 
Somerset.

Bill Oddie, actor, bird-watcher
and former presenter of BBC’s Springwatch and Autumnwatch, selected The
Farne Islands in Northumberland for the list.

He said: 'There are just a few places that I would
recommend to anyone and feel absolutely confident that they would have 
an unforgettable experience.

'The Farne Islands in Northumberland is – or
are – one of them.

'I’d recommend April to early September, with June 
and July for maximum bird activity. I have visited sea bird colonies all
round the world and believe me the Farnes are the best place to 
literally walk amongst terns, shags, kittiwakes and the photogenic and 
endlessly entertaining puffins. Simply the best.'

As old as time: Stonehenge in Wiltshire has made it onto the 'bucket list' of 101 things to do from VisitEngland

Legendary: Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, the mythical home of King Arthur

Mouthwatering: Enjoy fresh oysters at Whitstable, Kent

Meanwhile presenter Sonali Shah opted for coasteering in Cornwall: 'I've chosen coasteering in Cornwall as my ultimate pick, because it sounds like a super-charged version of something many of us will have tried as kids on a seaside holiday.

'The variety of activity – the sport involves swimming, jumping, diving, climbing and scrambling – would make it a totally adrenaline-packed experience, but you can also push yourself only as far as you want to.

'It's a unique way of exploring one of England's most stunning coastlines.'

Have a cuppa: Tea at Betty's in Harrogate, North Yorkshire is one of the must-do activities on the list

Aside from exploring England's diverse wildlife and nature, tourists can also experience the country's finest food and drink.

Tourist bosses suggest eating fish and chips on the beach at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, tucking into a 'proper' Cornish pasty in Redruth, or for the quintessential experience, having a truly English cuppa at the country's only tea estate in Tregothnan, Cornwall.

Michelin-starred chef Skye Gyngell, who selected oysters for the list, said: 'Eating oysters in Whitstable has to be a favourite of mine. I love oysters, they really are one of my favourite treats, and growing up I remember reading books that Whitstable featured in. So I think the combination of the two, a food I really love to eat and a town I read about thousands of miles away, makes this a special choice for me.'

Dress to impress: Tourists can enjoy a day out at Royal Ascot, Berkshire.

Meanwhile claymation favourites Wallace and Gromit asked for the finest example of English eccentricity to be added to the list - cheese rolling in the Cotswolds.

Other activities for the 'full English' experience include visiting Tintagel Castle, the legendary home of King Arthur, in Cornwall, having a night 'on the Toon' in Newcastle, and mixing Martinis at Dukes Bar in St James', the spiritual home of 007.
