It is a story as heart-warming of one of their Christmas adverts.

John Lewis has launched an appeal to find the five-year-old girl who wrote them a letter saying sorry for breaking a bauble.

Known only as Faith, the girl sent a handwritten apology to her local store after she said she accidentally broke the decoration on a visit to the shop.

Faith even attached two pound coins to the note, apologising for the damage she caused at the Cambridge branch of the department store.

Adorable: A child, known only as Faith, accidentally knocked a baubel decoration to the ground in Cambridge on Saturday - and wrote a letter to say sorry, attaching two pound coins with a piece of Sellotape

The letter arrived there after being posted to the ‘Christmas Department’ soon after her visit.

In the note, Faith said: ‘To John Lewis Cambridge, I am sorry I broke a Christmas bauble on Saturday.

‘It cost two pounds, here is the money. Sorry again, Faith. Aged 5.’

Staff at John Lewis are  touched by the gesture but also baffled as to who the young girl could be. Store boss Dominic Joyce said: ‘The letter arrived on Tuesday afternoon and had no return address or indication of who the young girl was. We really want to find out who she is so we can thank her.

‘She visited us on one of our busiest weekends of the year and we still are unsure as to which bauble was broken.

‘We’d like to thank her and because of her adorable letter maybe give her something from the store she would like.’

Mr Joyce also took to Twitter in an attempt to use social media to find out who the little girl is.

Earlier today he posted a tweet: 
‘@johnlewisretail the cutest letter sent to JL Cambridge. There is no 
address so we wanted to thank Faith on Twitter!’

Search: Since the tweet was posted, users have started using the hashtag 'FindFaith' in the hope of identifying Faith and allowing the John Lewis store (pictured) in Cambridge to get in contact with her

Broken: The bauble as it should look, and after it was smashed by the five-year-old girl

In another effort to locate the girl the hashtag ‘#findfaith’ has been seen across the social media platform in the Cambridge area.

Dominic said: ‘We will keep looking until we find her.

‘We’re hopeful we will as many people have shown interest as it has slowly spread to websites with the help of Twitter.’

Faith is believed to have visited the John Lewis store for an event based on its Bare and Hare television advertising campaign.

The £7million Disney-inspired advert tells the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn’t miss Christmas when he hibernates. The hare buys the bear an alarm clock to make sure he wakes up.

The advert has been a hit, the week after it was launched, the John Lewis had takings of £101.45 million, 10.7 per cent up on 2012.

One woman last night claimed on Twitter to have seen the little girl drop the bauble, @LizzieHannaford said: ‘I saw her drop the bauble when i was in JL for bare and hare!’
