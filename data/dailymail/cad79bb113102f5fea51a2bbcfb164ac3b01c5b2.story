This is the moment CCTV cameras caught a heroin addict just before he attacked three women with a claw hammer in a hotel room and then left with a large suitcase of stolen goods.

Cameras tracked Philip Spence's journey to the Cumberland hotel in London and his escape after the attack.

Spence, 32, admits grievous bodily harm against the three women in the early hours of April 6 but denies attempted murder.

Dressed in a t-shirt with a distinctive logo on the front, a dark blazer and a brown leather jacket, he concealed the hammer in his clothing.

He entered the hotel at around 1.09am and can be seen striding through the spacious white lobby moments before launching his savage attack. 

At 1.36am, he walks back out of the hotel through the lobby with a dark brown suitcase in his hand and turns left to go to Marble Arch.

The court was shown CCTV of Philip Spence in the entrance area at the Cumberland Hotel at 1.13am on April 6

Spence ditched the hammer out of a seventh floor fire escape window, jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard.

Two minutes later, Spence is seen running towards the N16 night bus to Victoria, breathing heavily and boarding. 

The footage showed him climbing the stairs to the empty upper deck and sitting on the back row with a large suitcase before travelling to co-defendant Thomas Efremi's flat in north London. 

He is seen getting off a second bus almost an hour after he is seen exiting the Cumberland Hotel.

Spence then walked to Efremi's flat and within minutes Efremi, 57, left his flat in possession of the stolen bank cards and withdrew £5000 in cash. 

Khulood Al Najjar, 36, and her sisters Ohoud, 34, and Fatima, 31, from the United Arab Emirates, suffered fractured skulls and life-threatening injuries in the 'vicious and sustained attack' at the four-star hotel.   

Southwark Crown Court heard that when he was arrested on April 10, Spence told police: 'There ain't no blood on the hammer. I licked it all off, it went down my throat, yeah.'

He was also said to have asked officers: 'Why so many of you involved? Are the Arabs paying you to catch me?'  

Efremi is later seen on CCTV shopping at various locations including the Vodafone store in Angel, north London.  

The court heard that following the attack Spence made several visits to Emma Moss, whose brother James, of Stroud Green in north London, has admitted handling stolen goods in relation to the case.

The 33-year-old pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods last week after police found a significant amount of the stolen property in his home.  

A stash of the victims' property was found hidden in Moss's cellar and the stolen brown suitcase was discovered in an Amazon cardboard box.

Officers found a prayer mat, a Gucci bag and some gold earrings belonging to 19-year-old Sheika Al-Mheiri.

There was also a Chanel compact, sunglasses, a camera, five mobile phones and three iPads concealed in a TopShop bag.

But valuables worth thousands of pounds were never recovered including two gold rings and two gold bracelets, one by designer Louis Vuitton, which were never found.

A Louis Vuitton necklace and gold earrings and a rose gold solitaire diamond ring have not been seen again.

Black Gucci sunglasses, cash and bank cards were also among the items which were not recovered after the attack. 

In a police statement read out in court, Ms Moss said: 'I have known Philip Spence since I was 10 years old. My family and his family are long-time friends.

'I have never been in a relationship with Philip and we have no sort of relationship because of his drug addiction. I believe he uses crack cocaine and heroin.

'He doesn't have a home and stays with different people. The last address he was at was in south-east London.

'I know Philip to be a criminal who commits burglaries and robberies and he has told me he has stolen from hotels before.

'He is also someone who exaggerates and tells lies.'

The court heard that on the evening of April 6, Spence turned up at Ms Moss's home.

Kahlood al-Najar told Southwark Crown Court that she was woken to the sound of Spence shouting 'give me the f****** money' before he hit her over the head 'around 30 times'

In her statement to police, she said: 'He was hyperactive and told me about getting £50,000 worth of jewellery, BlackBerrys, iPods, bags and perfume.

'He told me he got them from a hotel room. I knew he had done something bad but he often tells tales.'

Ms Moss said Spence was on crack but that she thought nothing more of what he had told her.

The following day he returned and appeared to be 'paranoid', telling Ms Moss that his friends were trying to set him up and he was in 'big trouble'.

She said Spence told her what had happened with the hammer, adding: 'Philip always carries a hammer with him.

'Philip told me that he had left the hammer there (at the hotel). He was crying but I believe this was about himself, not the women.' 

The court also heard Spence has a history of violence including an attempted hammer attack on his landlord.

Simon Mayo QC, for the prosecution, told a jury of seven women and five men that Spence had been convicted twice for ABH, twice for affray, five times for burglary and once for theft, amongst other offences.

The violence included attacks on a female council office worker, care home staff and passers-by on the street, and Spence also threatened to kill a man he met on an online dating site.

Explaining the previous incident with a hammer, Mr Mayo said: 'On November 13 2007, Spence threatened his landlord at Forest Road in Walthamstow regarding rent.

'Spence became abusive and took a hammer from his landlord's handyman bag and chased the victim.

'He then used the hammer to attack the door to get at the victim, smashing a glass panel.

'Spence left the building briefly before returning to attack the door a second time.'

Spence had also threatened to kill a man he had met through an online dating site before committing burglary at the victim's house, the court heard.

Mr Mayo told the court: 'Spence was in contact with a Mr Pasquarelli through an online dating site. When Mr Pasquarelli refused to meet him, Spence telephoned him and became abusive.

'On one occasion, overheard by police, Spence telephoned him and became abusive, threatening to kill the victim by stabbing him.

'Spence also admitted breaking into the victim's house in Peckham Grove.'

He was sentenced over the matter in September 2010 for sending a menacing message and burglary.

In April 2007 the defendant was sentenced for punching a female employee unconscious at Islington Borough Council offices in north London, the court heard.

Mr Mayo said: 'He was complaining about problems with his accommodation and shouted 'You will deal with this now' at a female member of staff.

'He punched her in the face, causing her to lose conciousness. She woke with serious head pain and later attended A&E.'

Spence was also said to have become violent towards staff at a care home for homeless people where he was staying.

He was sentenced in June 2011 for throwing a glass of water at one employee at the home before threatening staff that he would 'f*** (them) up'.

And in April 2011, he was convicted for kicking a box at a man before spitting at him, punching him and biting his life shoulder whilst walking along Conway Road in north London. 

Spence, from north-west London, is also standing trial for conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary alongside Thomas Efremi, 57, from Islington in north London.

While he was being held at Islington police station, Spence told officers: 'You know the only person you should be holding is Tom.'

Efremi, who denies the conspiracy charge but has admitted one count of fraud in relation to the case, shook his head in the dock as the statement was read out and looked away from Spence, who stared straight ahead.
