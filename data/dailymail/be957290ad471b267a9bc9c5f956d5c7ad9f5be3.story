A 625 pound felon who claimed his size made him a virtual prisoner in his home and that he shouldn’t be sent to prison after being convicted of making a bomb threat was arrested by police on earlier this month behind the wheel of his car.

Jeffery Klein of Jackson, Michigan, had spent more than two years claiming that any time behind bars could put Klein at extreme risk after he admitted calling in a bomb threat at the Cedar Springs Mobile Estates on Aug. 25, 2012.

When Klein repeatedly failed to appear for court hearings his attorney maintained that his client was unable to get himself to the courtroom.

Klein was eventually imprisoned after police pulled over a car with a broken tail-light on New Year's Day and found Klein behind the wheel

A Kent County Circuit Court judge was considering the possibility of home-based punishment after agreeing to take Klein’s plea via internet in December, reports MLive.

Then on New Year’s Day, police pulled over a car with a broken tail-light and found Klein behind the wheel.

Klein was arrested and housed at the Kent County Jail until he fell while using a walker and spent several days in the hospital prior to his January 23 sentencing.

In court Klein gave a tearful performance during which he said that he didn't know how long he had left and that he didn't want to die behind bars. Instead he was sentenced to at least 18 months. 

Klein was transferred to the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center in Jackson on Monday and in a month's time he will know where he will serve his sentence.

Since his arrest on New Year's Day, Klein has lost a staggering 65 pounds and he now weighs 560 pounds.

A Michigan corrections spokesman told MLive that prison can actually help severely obese inmates lose weight.

‘We’ve had prisoners come in here heavy and they’ve left us much healthier because they are under a specialized medical and dietary plan,’ said Chris Gautz.

Prisoners like Klein don't get special food, but do not have access to the quantities of food that led to obesity in the first place. Dietitians are also on hand to ensure that they get the necessary amount of calories.

Many facilities also have units with widened entries and specialized beds and larger prisoners can be housed on the ground floor to avoid stairs.
