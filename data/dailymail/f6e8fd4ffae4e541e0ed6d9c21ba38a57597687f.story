Paul McCartney has asked Vladimir Putin to release 28 Greenpeace activists arrested for scaling an oil rig.

The former Beatle reminded the Russian president that his 1968 single Back in the USSR was positive about the Soviet Union – and he wanted the favour returned.

In a letter, he said the White Album song also had a line about how good it was to come home and the protesters deserved the same thing.

Sir Paul McCartney has written a personal letter to the Russian president calling for the release of Greenpeace activists

Sir Paul, 71, said the activists, who 
include eight Britons, were not anti-Russian or violent. ‘It would be 
great if this misunderstanding could be resolved and the protesters can 
be home with their families in time for Christmas,’ he wrote.

‘Vladimir,
millions of people in dozens of countries would be hugely grateful if 
you were to intervene to bring about an end to this affair.’

The protesters, who  were arrested in the Arctic Sea on September 18, are being held in St Petersburg.

The Russian ambassador to London claims their plight has not been properly represented by the media.

Sir Paul, who has met Mr Putin in the Kremlin, wrote: 'Forty-five years ago I wrote a song about Russia for the White Album, back when it wasn't fashionable for English people to say nice things about your country.

'That song had one of my favourite Beatles lines in it: "Been away so long I hardly knew the place, gee it's good to be back home." Could you make that come true for the Greenpeace prisoners?'

This morning, after releasing the letter on his website, he tweeted: 'The Russian Ambassador kindly responded saying that their situation "is not properly represented in the world media"'.

The private letter, written on October 14, added: 'I understand of course that the Russian courts and the Russian Presidency are separate.

'Nevertheless I wonder if you may be able to use whatever influence you have to reunite the detainees with their families?'

'I am writing to assure you that the Greenpeace I know is most certainly not an anti-Russian organisation...And above all else they are peaceful. In my experience, non-violence is an essential part of who they are.'

Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: 'Sir Paul's letter is an extraordinary and beautiful plea for justice from one of the 20th century's most famous icons, and it went straight into the inbox of President Putin himself.

'We know some of the Arctic 30 are able to listen to the radio in their cells, and some of them are no doubt Beatles fans, so this news would be music to their ears. 

'Sir Paul is hugely respected in Russia, and so we hope his letter brings the day closer when those 30 brave men and women are back with their families.'

Greenpeace said more than two million people have sent letters and emails calling for the Arctic 30 to be released.
