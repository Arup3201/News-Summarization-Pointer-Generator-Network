British Gas has been hit by a 6 per cent fall in profits after fed up customers switched to cheaper rivals.

Parent company Centrica revealed its arm supplying homes with gas and electricity made £571million in 2013, down from £606million a year earlier.

Chief executive Sam Laidlaw hit out at political attacks on the industry but critics said the firm was continuing to make huge profits ‘on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed consumers’.

British Gas saw profits fall by 6 per cent, after 2 per cent of customers switched to rival firms

British Gas lost two per cent of its residential customers 2013, down to 15.3 million as households switched to other suppliers.

It came after its move to increase bills by 9.2per cent on average from November as part of the winter round of price hikes. Another 100,000 people have quit the group so far this year.

But the company claimed customer switching was now ‘stabilising’ after it scaled back its price rise by 3.2per cent following a shake-up of the Government's so-called green levies on bills.

Across the Centrica group as a whole, operating profits were 2 per cent lower at £2.7 billion last year.

Mr Laidlaw admitted that public and investor trust in the energy industry had been ‘damaged’ by the threat of price controls and political intervention.

He said: ‘British Gas has reduced prices, designed new, competitive propositions and has a renewed focus on service.

‘Our customers trust us to keep their lights on and their homes warm, as well as making the big, long-term investments which will secure their supplies for the future.

'As we continue to debate the right future shape and structure of our industry, we will never lose sight of that.’

However he attacked Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze bills for two years if Labour wins power in 2015, saying it was ‘not a credible solution’.

He said: ‘We firmly believe that any form of price control in a competitive market is not the answer and is not in the best interests of customers, and this has been clearly demonstrated by experience in other markets.

‘Such proposals create both short-term uncertainty for all energy suppliers and longer-term additional costs for customers,’ he added.

Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw blamed politicians for creating uncertainty in the energy market

Shares in Centrica have plunged by more than a fifth since autumn following Labour's price freeze pledge.

The stock has been driven down further after Energy Secretary Ed Davey recently called for a full-scale investigation into the energy market that could see British Gas broken up.

In a letter, Mr Davey urged competition authorities to ‘think radically’ as they consider whether to launch a probe.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘British Gas are still posting decent profits, despite angry customers leaving following recent price hikes and the company receiving over a million complaints last year. 

‘When healthy profits aren't based on satisfied customers it's further evidence the energy market is broken.’

Centrica's results showed that higher wholesale prices and unseasonally warm weather at the end of last year saw British Gas suffer an 18 per cent slump in operating profit in the final six months of 2013, which offset a better start to the year.

Caroline Flint, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: ‘However you look at it, there’s no hiding the fact that on David Cameron’s watch the energy companies have made their profits on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed consumers.

‘That’s why the next Labour Government will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation.

‘Our plans will break up the big energy companies, put an end to their secret deals and make tariffs simpler and fairer. And until these reforms kick in, we will put a stop to unfair price rises by freezing energy bills until 2017, saving the average household £120.’
