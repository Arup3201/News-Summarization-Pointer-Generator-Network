Sex worker Charlotte Rose, who has slept with more than 1,000 men, is to stand as an MP in the Clacton by-election in Essex next month

A former 'Sex Worker of the Year' who claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men is to stand as an independent MP.

Self-confessed 'high-class courtesan' Charlotte Rose, 34, will be going up against Ukip defector Douglas Carswell and 1980s television star Giles Watling in the Clacton by-election, in Essex.

She previously appeared in a Channel 4 TV series about prostitution called Love for Sale, which starred Rupert Everett and Russell Brand.

But now the sex worker, who started out in the industry at just 17 when she agreed to take part in a dominatrix-themed photo shoot, says she is ready for a life in politics.

'My main policy is about sexual freedom, taking control away from others,' said Ms Rose, who charges £180 an hour for her services.

'I also want there to be better sexual education in schools.

'Schools are not obliged to teach advanced sex and relationship education, which can deal with issues such as porn addiction and intimacy issues.

'Today's politicians have a lack of knowledge and understanding about what's really happening.

'Sex and relationships are second to survival when it comes to basic human needs.

'I'm dead against trafficking of women, but a large amount of women also choose to be sex workers - we do this work because we enjoy it.

'We want to help people learn and gain knowledge and skills.'

After delving into the world of domination, Ms Rose fell pregnant and had the first of two children with her childhood sweetheart.

But their seven-year relationship broke down when her partner had an affair with a neighbour.

She then completed a hospitality degree at Plymouth University, where she worked in hotels, before deciding to combine two of her passions, people and sex, and become an escort.

The mother-of-two joined a local escort agency but, after finding herself travelling far afield to get work, became independent.

She moved to London from Exeter, Devon, after claiming she was hounded out by locals following media attention sparked by the Love for Sale TV show.

She won a British Erotic Award for being Sex Worker of the Year 2013 and launched a sexual training franchise

Ms Rose won a British Erotic Award for being Sex Worker of the Year 2013 and has launched a sexual training franchise as part of a bid to improve people's sex lives.

She said the government had failed to address issues with 'porn addiction' which had led to young men causing harm to women by trying to recreate what they have seen on the web.

The aspiring politician also hit out at the authorities for failing to act over the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal.

She said: 'It's appalling that people and government are too scared to take action.

'All politicians talk about family values, but how can they do that without talking about sex.'
