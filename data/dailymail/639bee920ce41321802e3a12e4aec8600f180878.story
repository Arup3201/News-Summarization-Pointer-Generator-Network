Caring about the poor doesn’t make me a Communist, the pope has insisted.

Francis said that he had been labelled a Marxist simply for following church teachings on defending the rights of the less well off.

In a six-page speech delivered in his native Spanish, he lamented that ‘land, housing and work are increasingly unavailable to the majority’ of the world’s population,

Pope Francis calls 'for dignity of the rural family, for water, for life and for all to benefit from fruits of the earth'

‘It is strange, but if I talk like this, there are those who say that the Pope is a communist,’ he added.

Church doctrine commands Catholics to fight ‘for the dignity of the rural family, for water, for life and for all to benefit from the fruits of the earth,’ he said.

He said it was right ‘to combat the structural causes of poverty, inequality, unemployment and [loss of] land, housing, social and labour rights’

Christians must also confront the destructive effects of the ‘Empire Of Money’ – namely forcible displacements and migrations, human and drug trafficking, war, violence,’ he said.

Francis was speaking to participants at the World Meeting of Popular Movements, which is holding a three-day conference in Rome this week, partly organised by the Vatican’s Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace.

The Holy Father says  the ‘Empire Of Money’ behind forced migrations, human and drug trafficking, war, violence

The global conference, for trade unions, the landless, peasant farmers, precarious workers and domestic workers among others, includes the Argentine Excluded Workers Movement, the Brazilian Rural Workers Without Land Movement as well as Bolivian President Evo Morale who was there to represent indigenous tribes.

Francis has been labelled a communist by some hard right elements in the US after denouncing the ‘tyranny of capitalism’, calling the wealth made from financial speculation as intolerable and saying speculation on commodities was a scandal that compromised the poor’s access to food.
