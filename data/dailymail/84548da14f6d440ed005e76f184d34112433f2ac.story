There were 2,253 at the Racecourse Ground last weekend as Wrexham beat Woking to make it to round two of the FA Cup. As is often the case, the Welsh club’s most famous FA Cup face was one of them.

‘Yes, I still go there when I can,’ former Wrexham forward Mickey Thomas told Sportsmail. ‘And when I do people still ask me about the goal.

‘Of all the things that happened to me in my life and my career, that is the one that people want to talk about the most. I must get asked about it by somebody every day of my life.’

Nobody over a certain age will need reminding what ‘the goal’ is.

Thomas’s left-foot free-kick against Arsenal on January 4, 1992 helped Wrexham to a famous third round win over the First Division team and was recently voted one of the BBC’s top 50 FA Cup goals.

Having played in a final for Manchester United in 1979 and reached the last eight during his first spell at Wrexham the previous year, Thomas still treasures his hammer blow from the Racecourse as his favourite memory which is perhaps why he - among others - was disappointed to learn that third round weekend will have a different look about it this season.

Because of the full programme of Barclays Premier League fixtures on New Year’s Day - a Thursday - talks are under way about shifting the weekend’s FA Cup games across the Sunday, Monday and perhaps even Tuesday.

For the traditionalists it is yet another dispiriting development.

Hereford 2-1 Newcastle (1972)

After drawing 2-2 with their top flight opponents at St James’ Park, non-league Hereford produced a massive upset when they knocked out Newcastle in extra time thanks to Ricky George’s winner.

Sutton 2-1 Coventry  (1989)

Coventry, then a top flight side, had won the FA Cup just 18 months prior to this match, but goals from Tony Rains and Matthew Hanlan ensured the Sky Blues were humbled by non-league Sutton at Gander Green Lane.

Wrexham 2-1 Arsenal (1992)

Reigning First Division champions Arsenal were fully in control of their match against Fourth Division Wrexham until a two-minute spell late on, in which goals from Mickey Thomas and Steve Watkin sent the Racecourse Ground faithful into raptures.

Burnley 1-0 Liverpool (2005)

Rafa Benitez paid the price for fielding a weakened XI against Championship side Burnley, as Djimi Traore’s famous spinning, backheel goal sent the Anfield side crashing out of the competition.

Manchester United 0- 1 Leeds (2010)

Jermaine Beckford’s chipped finish decided the latest installment of this classic rivalry with two divisions separating the sides. United’s poor performance didn’t prevent Sir Alex Ferguson complaining after referee Phil Dowd played only five minutes of injury time.

‘Sometimes I wonder if the English football authorities realise what a special thing they have in the FA Cup,’ added Thomas, 60. ‘Everywhere I go around the country or around the world people talk about the FA Cup. It’s so special to so many people.

‘Yet here we seem determined to do our best to sideline it and undermine it to the point that it looks to everybody else as if we just don’t care about it.

‘It’s just strange because most football fans I know still love the competition.

‘I certainly do. I was a fan of football before I was a player and I am a fan now. When I was growing up my dream was to play in big FA Cup ties. I was lucky enough to be able to do it and I will never forget it. I think we need to cherish the FA Cup, not mess about with it.

‘The third round is supposed to be one of the really big days on the calendar as it is when all the big boys from the top division turn up. It’s a day when all the players and fans of the smaller clubs have something to dream about. It won’t be the same though if all the games are being played at different times. I am just very disappointed.’

Over the years the FA Cup has been squeezed from several different angles. Repeat replays - such a memory of many childhoods - were lost to the expansion of the Champions League, regional semi-finals lost to the need to pay for the new Wembley, and the final’s 3pm kick-off time lost to the demands of the TV companies.

Scorer of the winning goal for Wimbledon against Liverpool in the 1988 final was Lawrie Sanchez - and he believes this season’s problem could have been avoided.

Sanchez, who also led Wycombe to the semi-final in 2001, said: ‘If they’d looked ahead they could have seen this coming.

‘The situation should have been seen in good time, with New Year’s Day on a Thursday. No-one will want to lose those fixtures because it’s one of the biggest days of the year for attendances.

‘But the third round could have been a weekend later, on the 10th. As it is the majority of the Premier League will see this as a chance to rest players in the FA Cup and have the excuse that they have had a tough period over Christmas and New Year.

‘I’m sure it will pan out that way. I’ll be interested to see how many Premier League players start the game on New Year’s Day and then the FA Cup game.

‘I would say no more than 15 to 20 per cent.’

With an increasing number of foreign managers and players in the English game, it is no longer safe to presume those involved will understand the unique place the FA Cup has always had in English consciousness.

Too many Premier League managers now seem to approach the competition as one that gets in the way, while Newcastle actually announced last summer that progress in cup competitions was of no particular interest to them as it was perceived to have no long-term value.

Perhaps then it is time, as Sanchez suggests here, to add new incentives. ‘There’s still a passion for the FA Cup,’ he added.

‘You can see it this year with attendances up, and the draws back on Mondays, where people want them to be. The BBC are helping to push it back into the conscience of the people.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admitted last year that they don't have particular interest in cup competitions

‘It’s the oldest competition in the world. By comparison, the Premier League is a new competition.

‘I’m not trying to say anything against the Premier League, but the FA Cup is a massive deal. It is the crown jewel and we need to keep its integrity intact.

‘A Champions League place for the winners would concentrate the minds of the Premier League clubs a little bit more and take away the sanctimonious idea that finishing fourth is a big achievement for the season.

‘Whether UEFA would allow it, I don’t know, but they’ve given a Champions League place to the winners of the Europa League so why not?’

1991 - To avoid fixture pile-ups, FA Cup ties were limited to one replay followed by extra time and penalties. The longest ever tie was the fourth qualifying round clash between Oxford City and Alvechurch in 1971. It stretched to six matches, Alvechurch winning the fifth replay 1-0. 1991 also saw the first Wembley semi-final, Tottenham beating Arsenal 3-1.

2000 - Starting with Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Aston Villa, drawn FA Cup finals would no longer be replayed and instead settled by extra time and then penalties.

2011 - Wembley hosted the Champions League final and UEFA’s rule that no fixture could be played on the surface in the two weeks before the match meant the FA Cup final was brought forward. That meant Manchester City’s 1-0 win over Stoke clashed with the penultimate round of Premier League games.

2012 - Again, the final was played on the same day as Premier League fixtures, this time to provide a four-week break before the start of Euro 2012. To avoid clashing kick-off times, the Wembley showpiece was moved to 5.15pm, where it has remained since.

2014-15 - Those third-round ties featuring top-flight clubs will be moved from Saturday, January 3, to Sunday or Monday to allow for a full Premier League programme two days earlier on New Year’s Day.
