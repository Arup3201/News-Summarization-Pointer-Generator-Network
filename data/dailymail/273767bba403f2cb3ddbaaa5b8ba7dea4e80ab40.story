The father of a man fatally shot by police at a Walmart for holding a toy gun says a cellphone call in which he heard his son's dying breaths keeps replaying in his head.

John Crawford Jr. talked about that last day of son's life to the Cincinnati Enquirer in a telephone interview from his home in Jackson, Tennessee, recalling how his son was 'gasping' for life.

His son, John Crawford III, was shot Aug. 5 in a Walmart in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek, Ohio.

Dying words: John Crawford Jr. (above) says he heard his son 'gasping' for breath after he was shot by officers at a Walmart in Ohio

Officers have said Crawford III was shot when he didn't respond to orders to put down the gun he was holding, which they claim they believed was real. 

This all happened after a shopper contacted police to report that Crawford III was waving an A5-15 rifle at customers, including children. 

But footage of the 22-year-old proves he was in fact holding an unpackaged MK-177 BB rifle he had picked up in the store's toy department. 

The family has requested public release of the store video, but Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has refused to release it while the investigation is continuing.

Crawford Jr. said he was in Ohio the day of the shooting and had stopped by to see his son, who wasn't at his Fairfield home. The mother of his son's two young children was there talking on her cellphone to Crawford III, who was at the Wal-Mart shopping, according to Crawford Jr. He said she began screaming when she heard shots and put the call on speaker.

'You could hear in the background he was gasping,' Crawford Jr. told the newspaper. 

'I'm virtually listening to my kid taking his last breath.'

Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier is now overseeing the investigation as special prosecutor. Piepmeier is scheduled to present evidence in the case to a Greene County grand jury this month. Jurors will determine if anyone should be charged in the shooting.

But the parents of Crawford III and their attorney have asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to take over the investigation and determine if there were any civil rights violations.

'We do believe there was a violation of his civil rights and that does have to do with race,' family attorney Michael Wright said.

Federal authorities have said they are monitoring the situation.

Crawford Jr. described his son as a typical 22-year-old who was laid back and very family oriented. He had once considered going into the military and had recently said he wanted to start college, his father said.

'He was figuring out his next step,' Crawford Jr. said.

The final autopsy report has not been completed, and Crawford Jr. said he has not been told which of the two officers involved shot his son.
