Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp believes that Manchester City will recover from their 2-2 draw with QPR on Saturday, but he is not certain it will be in time to catch runaway leaders Chelsea.

The reigning Premier League champions were forced to come from behind twice before settling for a draw at Loftus Road, which leaves them eight-points behind Chelsea who defeated Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield.

Manuel Pellegrini claimed his side were unlucky for a second successive away game and insisted that he is not concerned by the results being racked up at Stamford Bridge.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea have opened up an eight-point lead over City following a 2-1 win at Anfield

'I think we were very unlucky – we are not playing well but we had enough chances to win the game. It was the same against West Ham in our last defeat where their goalkeeper was the best player,' said Pellegrini.

'I'm not worried about Chelsea – they are in a good moment but we have a lot more games to play. At this moment we are just thinking about returning to our style of play,' he added.

However, speaking in his role as Sky Sports pundit, Redknapp said: 'Not worried about being eight points behind the Chelsea of last season would be alright, but eight points behind Chelsea from this season is a different matter.'

The former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder also claimed that the Manchester club were fortunate not to have lost the game against his father Harry's side.

'City got away with it. If it wasn't for Aguero they would have lost that game,' he said.

'Fernandinho and Yaya Toure have not been anywhere near the right level. Defensively as well, they are giving away too many silly goals.

'They will come back because they have too many good players – but they have to comeback quickly because this Chelsea side can run away with it.'

Sergio Aguero may come away with the plaudits after his exquisite brace prevented City from leaving empty handed, but Redknapp was equally impressed with Rangers striker Charlie Austin who opened the scoring after having two previous efforts disallowed.

'I'd never have believed at the start of the year if you'd have said we'd be talking about him for England. I'd have said 'do me a favour'. It just shows you,' said Redknapp.

City keeper Joe Hart explains to Austin why his opening strike was disallowed

'Five years ago he was playing for Poole Town. Now look at him; he is giving top centre-backs real problems. It's a great story.'

Austin's opening attempt was disallowed after City keeper Joe Hart touched the ball twice in his area meaning his goal kick had to be retaken, although the QPR striker was unaware of the decision.

When asked if he knew that his strike had been ruled out, he said: ‘No, didn’t you see from my celebration? I turned around and no one was with me!'
