Shoppers dusted off their shoulder pads and donned their biggest flares as they were taken back in time wit a show of Britain's favourite fashions from decades past.

The Marks and Spencer Company Archive showcased pieces from the swinging sixties, super seventies and eccentric eighties with a nostalgic event in Leeds today – where the retailer’s story began.

More than 70,000 historic items were on display and guests were asked to dress in items from the era were they could enjoy being pampered by two vintage make-up and hair artists.

The archive demonstrates how style evolved for men, women and children over the three decade period - in a time when the miniskirt and bell-bottom flares were all the rage.

Visitors could take part in twisting and disco dancing classes and the best dressed was in with a chance of winning a £50 M&S voucher.

Helen Chatterton, education and outreach officer at the M&S Company Archive, said: ‘These three decades are key to the development of technology, fashion and pop culture, so we are thrilled that we can use the resources here at the archive to transport visitors to these iconic decades.’

There were also a mixture of fashion adverts, in store display photography and product images on show.

Marks and Spencer was formed in 1884 when Michael Marks, a Polish refugee opened a market stall in Leeds with the slogan ‘don’t ask the price, it’s a penny’.

He went into partnership with Thomas Spencer, a former cashier from wholesale company Dewhirst, in 1894 and subsequently opened their first shop in Leeds in 1904.

It became a limited public company in 1926 before opening its flagship store in Marble Arch four years later – a year before it introduced a food department.
