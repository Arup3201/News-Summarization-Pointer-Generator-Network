Most passengers are accustomed to stepping off the plane and onto a crowded shuttle bus, so seeing a luxury car waiting on the tarmac may be a welcome sight indeed.

American Airlines has announced a new service  in partnership with Cadillac to shuttle VIP passengers with tight transfer times directly from the plane to their next gate. 

Available only to members of the airline's invitation-only ConciergeKey program, it follows other airlines offering similar services to first class passengers.

VIP: Passengers with tight transfer times will be collected from the tarmac and driven to their next gate

Delta currently chauffeurs its premium passengers between flights in a Porsche, while United has teamed up Mercedes-Benz for its private transfers.

By pre-arrangement, American Airlines will collect passengers from the tarmac in a Cadillac CTS, SRX or Escalade and transfer them to their next departure gate.

American Airlines' partnership with Cadillac is currently only available  at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). 

There are plans to roll out the service to Dallas/Fort Worth, John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia in New York by the end of the year, pending approval.

As part of this partnership, American's AAdvantage members will also be able to earn additional miles - 7,500 to be exact - when they test drive a Cadillac at their local dealership. 

'American and Cadillac are two iconic American brands, both in the process of redefining the contemporary American luxury experience,' said Suzanne Rubin, President of the AAdvantage Loyalty Program.

'This is just the beginning of the opportunities we will see with our partnership with Cadillac, and we are thrilled to be able to offer these benefits to our customers.' 

American Airlines is now the world's largest airline following its merger with US Airways.
