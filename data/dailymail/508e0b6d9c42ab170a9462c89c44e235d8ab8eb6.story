The restaurant manager and barman of an upmarket riverside restaurant stood before a judge today accused of killing a customer.

The two men, along with the boyfriend of another colleague, allegedly restrained the man so forcefully that he stopped breathing and suffered a fatal heart attack.

Gary Eastley, Jake Corney and Dawid Lamkowski deny the charge of manslaughter.

A jury heard that Eastley and Lamkowski 
held Marcin Pastuszczak down on the ground outside Boulters Restaurant and Bar in Maidenhead for more than half an hour, before 
being joined by Corney.

When police arrived at the scene in Maidenhead, Berkshire, they turned the unresponsive 34-year-old over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue. They called for an ambulance and tried in vain to revive him.

The three defendants and barmaid Tasha Wicks - Corney’s girlfriend - were all arrested even though Mr Pastuszczak was not formally pronounced dead until the following morning.

Police later charged the men with manslaughter on the grounds of using unreasonable force against their victim.

Prosecutor John Price QC told the nine women and three men on the jury: ‘Prolonged restraint of a person, involving the application of pressure to their trunk or torso, may inhibit the in-and-out movements of the chest which are essential for proper respiration.

‘In other words, an individual may be prevented by such pressure from fully breathing in and out.

‘Mr Pastuszczak had been restrained with such force and for so long a time that ultimately he suffered a cardiac arrest, itself being brought on because during the time he was under the restraint he could not breathe properly.’

He told the jury at Guildford Crown Court: ‘They are charged with the offence of manslaughter because the use of the force by which the fatal restraint was applied by them, was unlawful.’

Mr Price said that following his arrest, bar manager Gary Eastley had told police the victim had grabbed him and had been trying to do the same to barmaid Tasha Wicks and get her telephone number.

He said that fearing for his safety and that of colleagues and customers, he had restrained the man, before restaurant manager Lamkowski helped to take him outside.

Meanwhile, Miss Wicks made the first of several emergency calls to Thames Valley Police.

When police arrived at the scene in Maidenhead, Berkshire, they turned the unresponsive drinker over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue

‘He continued to struggle violently. He had so much strength. He was lashing out at us,’ Eastley said in a prepared statement to the police.

‘We were simply trying to restrain him, desperate for the police to arrive.’

However, jurors watched CCTV footage from cameras at the restaurant which showed that after the initial restraint inside the bar, Mr Pastuszczak was lying on the floor motionless and was even dragged from the room without appearing to offer any resistance.

Accounts by other customers, David Chapman and Laura Tuffrey, on Mr Pastuszczak’s behaviour before and after the initial confrontation contrasted with Eastley’s statement, said the prosecution.

Mr Price said earlier CCTV footage also cast doubt on Eastley’s account of the victim’s alleged aggression and behaviour towards him and Miss Wicks.

He said: ‘It is submitted by the prosecution that by comparison with other available evidence as to what took place on the first floor, what was said can be demonstrated to be untrue.

‘Things did not happen as he described to the police.’

Once outside the bar the employees got Mr Pastuszczak onto the ground again. Corney then arrived, having heard of the situation in a phone call with his girlfriend.

He joined in the restraint, allowing Eastley to return inside and make more calls to the police.

The prosecution said it was during this time that Corney could be seen striking a number of blows at the victim.

‘The prosecution submit that Mr Corney had an agenda of his own. It was to punish him. This was not and could never have been lawful,’ said Mr Price.

He accepted that by the fateful night of November 8, 2012, 34-year-old Polish-born Mr Pastuszczak had established a reputation as a heavy drinker and troublemaker, which had seen him barred from a number of pubs in the Berkshire town.

He had even had a confrontation with Eastley at the bar five months before his death and it was this which the prosecution believes played a large part in what happened.

He urged the jury to base their findings predominantly on what happened on the night in question and not previous events.

To do otherwise would be, he said, using a footballing analogy, ‘to play the man rather than the ball’, which is what he said Eastley had done.

‘He responded not to the behaviour in front of him but to the reputation,’ he said.

Eastley, 26, from Moor Lane, Maidenhead, Lamkowski, 29, from Snowdon Avenue, Maidstone, Kent, and Jake Corney, 23, of Filmer Road, Windsor, Berkshire, all deny the single charge.

The trial, before Judge Christopher Critchlow is expected to last about two weeks.
