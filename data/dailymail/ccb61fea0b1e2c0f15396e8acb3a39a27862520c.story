The former prime minister said it Ed Miliband must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and Europe. He said changing course now would only 'confuse' voters

Tony Blair this morning launched a furious assault on Ukip in the wake of the party's European election triumph - describing it as 'nasty and unpleasant'.

The former Prime Minister urged the Labour leader Ed Miliband to 'stand up' and take on Nigel Farage.

He said Mr Miliband had to 'stand firm' in the face of growing demands to promise an in-out referendum on Europe and ignore pleas from within his party to take a tougher stance on immigration.

It came after Labour MP Simon Danczuk broke ranks to demand stricter curbs on who can come to work in Britain.

But Mr Blair said swinging to the right on Europe and immigration would only 'confuse' Labour voters.

The former PM's intervention this morning risks deepening the growing division within the party over how to respond to Ukip's rise, amid growing fears that it will eat into traditional Labour heartlands at next year's election.

Labour MP Ben Bradshaw ‏said Mr Blair's interview was 'great'. He added, in a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Miliband, that it was 'what many of us have been wanting & waiting to hear'.

Speaking on Radio 4, Mr Blair said: 'The way to deal with Ukip is to stand up and take them on, because what they're putting before people is a set of solutions that anybody who analyses where a country like Britain has to be in the 21st century, knows they are solutions that are regressive, reactionary and would make all the problems of the country worse, not better.'

Mr Blair added that Mr Miliband had to be 'prepared to stand up, to lead, to take them on' and 'confront and expose reactionary forces'.

When asked about the growing pressure to offer voters an in-out referendum, Mr Blair added: 'I’d advise him to stay firm.'

He said: 'It’s not as if yielding to that pressure from Ukip has actually done the Conservatives any good at the present time.

'For the Labour Party if it tries to follow either Ukip on its anti-European platform or, even worse frankly, on its anti-immigrant platform, all that will happen is it will confuse its own supporters and it won't actually draw any greater support.'

He said to allow a trend of 'anti-immigrant feeling' would be a 'huge mistake for the country'.

Mr Blair added: 'People in Ukip always say that the other politicians don't get it. I mean, I do get it and I get them. You look a little bit beneath that Ukip facade and you see something in my view pretty nasty and unpleasant.'

Veteran Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said Ukip voters were 'blaming foreigners' for the country's problems and urged David Cameron to push ahead with his plan to reform the EU

Mr Blair's warning was echoed by the veteran Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke - who also lashed out at Ukip for pandering anti-immigration voters.

Speaking before Mr Blair on the Today programme this morning, the Europhile former Tory Chancellor claimed Mr Farage was out of touch with ordinary Brits who did not care that the UK attracted a lot of foreigners.

In a dig at the Ukip leader's comments that he felt uncomfortable listening to foreign languages on the train, Mr Clarke said: 'Every western country is multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and everybody gets used to listening to foreign languages on the bus. Young people aren't bothered by that.'

Mr Clarke accepted immigration needed to be 'controlled' but added that Britain needed foreigners to help the economy.

He added: 'We need some people to do jobs that British people somehow can't be persuaded to do.'

Ukip's rise was 'symbolic of the disillusion' voters felt with politics, Mr Clarke said. He added: 'People are blaming foreigners and blaming Brussels.'

But he said: 'Only one in 10 of the electorate voted for UKIP... the important thing is, really, two-thirds of the electorate couldn't be bothered to vote at all.

'I think what we have to do is firstly persuade those people - particularly younger people - actually to vote when they say they're not interested or all the politicians are the same and all the rest of it.

'We have to make the case, the intelligent case, why it's in Britain's national interest to stay in the European Union, and what sensible reforms we can actually make of the European Union that mainstream politicians across the rest of Europe are likely to agree to, because they face the same problem that we do.

'I think, actually, we need to articulate the case, as to why it's in the national interest - particularly younger people whose future it is - that our prosperity, our political security, our role in the world actually depend on our being a leading member of the European Union.'

The Cabinet minister dismissed suggestions his colleague Theresa May was being soft on immigration but agrees it is good for the country.

'We're in the 21st century, it's no good blaming foreigners, blaming England, telling our damn politicians 'you need to look at our role in the EU in terms of the malaise of the population in their prosperity and the sense of security.

'The first thing to point out is that immigration is a feature of the 21st century in every prosperous western democracy.'

Mr Blair's remarks this morning came after he was criticised  for complaining about voters who elected Ukip MEPs opposed to rampant immigration – despite  running an ‘open door’ policy on migrants while in office.

The former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the EU was dominated by ‘anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe’. These, he added, were ‘not answers to what is happening in the world’.

But critics pointed out that it was Mr Blair’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade, creating the largest population explosion since Saxon times.

In his comments, made to a Swedish television station, Mr Blair said: ‘Of course we should be worried when a party like Ukip comes first in the European election, it would be foolish not to be.

‘But on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of Britain in the 21st century.

‘When the world is changing so fast, to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe, these are not solutions for the 21st century.’

But Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said Mr Blair was a member of a ‘supranational, smug, anti-democratic elite’.

He added: ‘Tony Blair was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened.

Labour’s open-door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in Britain in more than a thousand years.

Between 1997 and 2010, the foreign-born population of the UK increased by three million, while nearly a million British citizens left.

In that period, the size of the foreign-born workforce nearly doubled.

In 1997, people born outside the UK held two million jobs – making up around 7.5 per cent of the total workforce. By 2009, that had swelled to 3.8million jobs, or 13 per cent of the total.

Labour ministers predicted in 2004 that opening Britain’s labour market to millions of workers from former Eastern Bloc countries would result in only 13,000 new arrivals. By the end of 2009, more than a million workers had signed up to a Home Office registration scheme.

In 2009 former Blairite aide Andrew Neather revealed that the increase in immigration under Labour was a deliberate policy designed to change Britain.

He said the influx of foreign nationals was intended to socially engineer a ‘truly multicultural’ country.

It was also a politically motivated attempt to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’, he said.

Mr Neather, a former speechwriter to Mr Blair, wrote that ‘the policy of ministers from late 2000 ... was to open up the UK to  mass migration.’
