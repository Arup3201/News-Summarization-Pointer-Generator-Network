Wayne Rooney will only be truly appreciated by England fans and pundits when he is gone, according to Leighton Baines.

Rooney, at 29, is set to win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday and is six goals shy of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goalscoring record of 49.

But he has come in for criticism of his form at various points in his career, particularly at major tournaments.

Baines, however, said the pressure placed on Rooney’s shoulders was greater than any of his international team-mates and that he frequently provided the goods. 'Sometimes it’s not until later on that people get the credit they deserve,’ said Baines. 'If Wayne can keep fit, keep playing, he’s going to break more records.

'He has been at the forefront of everything England have done since his involvement in the squads and has carried a lot of pressure. Everyone will look back when he’s finished and has broken all the records and will acknowledge he has been one of the all-time greats for England.

'It will be great to see Wayne get 100 caps, thoroughly well deserved. He’s got a really good goal-scoring record and has scored some really important goals down the years for England.

'He’s carried more than his fair share of weight of expectation that comes with England. Wayne has always been someone that people have focused on and we’ve asked a lot of him over the years and he’s tended to produce.’

Baines added: 'He’s moved into his role as captain and rightly so. He’s earned that right to be leading the team. He’s a leader amongst the squad.’

Baines also gave his support to Roy Hodgson being handed a contract extension.

'The players would all be delighted with that,’ added the Everton left-back.

'We all enjoy working with him. He’s a good guy, a good person to speak to. He’s got a lot of knowledge about football, has had a lot of different jobs, worked in different countries. Us, as a bunch of players, would be really happy if he extended.’
