The model girlfriend of American football star Philip Wheeler joined a major breastfeeding protest at a Florida mall on Friday after she was attacked online for sharing a picture of herself feeding her son.

Ashley Nicole, partner of the Miami Dolphins linebacker, joined the demonstration to support the mom who was asked to leave a South Florida earlier this week for breastfeeding.

More than 100 women took part in the protest at Aventura Mall after mom Kristie Quinones was asked to leave, according to TMZ.

Nicole described being involved as 'an honor' and again posted a photo of herself breastfeeding to Instagram.

'I wisssssshhhhh someone would ever say something to me about nursing my child in public,' she wrote.

The photograph is still post on Ashley's Instagram page and it is understood Miss Nicole has no plans to remove it.

The image attracted more than 2,000 likes from users as well as a raft of comments supporting Nicole.
