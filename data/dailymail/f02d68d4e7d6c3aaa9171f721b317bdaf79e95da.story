David Cameron has ordered Tory fundraisers to build a £30 million election warchest to keep Ed Miliband out of power.

Tory chiefs have been told they need to raise £100,000 a day between now and the election to pay for what is set to be the most expensive campaign for years.

Insiders say the demanding target is being achieved as entrepreneurs alarmed by Ed Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric reach for their chequebooks.

David Cameron has ordered Tory fundraisers to build a £30million election warchest to keep Ed Miliband out of power. It means Tory chiefs will need to raise £100,000 a day between now and the election

A senior Tory source said: ‘We’ve been told we need to raise £100,000 every day – including weekends. It’s a huge target but we’re confident we can hit it.

‘Our message to our donors is quite simple - don’t risk letting Labour back in.

‘We tell them to think of their donation as an insurance policy against Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister.’

The source said Labour would ‘never raise this amount from the unions – or anyone else’.

Election spending for each party is capped at about £20 million in the year running up to the general election. In the last campaign the Conservatives spent £16.7 million – around £3 million short of the limit.

The new target shows the Tories are determined to max out their spending this time.

But it also suggests they may want to pay off their £2 million debts and start amassing funds to pay for a potential snap election if next May’s vote results in another hung parliament.

The first signs of the new Tory drive came in official figures for party fundraising in the first quarter of this year.

The Conservatives raised £6.6 million in this period, compared to £4.4 million for Labour, £1 million for the Liberal Democrats and just under £500,000 for Ukip.

The Tory effort comes as Labour faces a funding crisis.

The party is already more than £12 million in debt and is unlikely to be able to rely on soft loans from the beleaguered Co-op Bank to keep it afloat.

The GMB union has said it will cut £1 million from its automatic affiliation fees following Ed Miliband’s decision to reform Labour’s links with the unions. Affiliation fees are also likely to fall from the other main unions, including Unite, which bankrolls the party.

The shortfall will force Mr Miliband to go cap-in-hand to union barons, such as Unite’s Len McCluskey, in the hope of getting top-up donations from their political funds.

Mr Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric has seen donations from entrepreneurs all but dry up compared to the New Labour years. Union donations now account for around £80 per cent of Labour’s total.
