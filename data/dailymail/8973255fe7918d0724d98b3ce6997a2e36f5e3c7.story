Labour MP Frank Field is in hospital after collapsing at a meeting in Birkenhead last night

Veteran Labour MP Frank Field is in hospital after collapsing at a meeting yesterday evening.

The 72-year-old apparently blacked out following a public meeting and was taken to hospital by ambulance.

He had been at a meeting at Highfield Church on the future of the Rock Ferry High School site. 

Mr Field is being treated at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital.

He is reportedly responding well to treatment.

A witness told the Wirral Globe Mr Field appeared to have 'fainted' as the debate grew heated.

A Labour Party spokesman told the newspaper: 'He was taken to hospital last night.

'He is responding well to treatment. He will be making his own statement in due course.' 

A statement on the Save Rock Ferry High School Facebook page reported Mr Field said: 'Thankfully, I was told he was sitting up and OK but he was being taken to hospital for a check up.

'I also saw the ambulance arrive so that is likely to have been the case.

'Other than that, we know nothing and share your concern.' 

It added: 'We wish Mr Field well and a speedy recovery.' 

Mr Field, who was born in London, was first elected to the Commons in 1979. 

Previously, he was the first director of pressure group The Child Poverty Action, from 1969 to 1979.

He was famously told to 'think the unthinkable' by Tony Blair while welfare reform minister. He resigned later after reported clashes with Gordon Brown and Harriet Harman. 

He went on to become one of the Labour Government's most outspoken critics.

After the party's defeat in the 2010 general election, he was appointed Prime Minister David Cameron's poverty tsar and became the first member of the Labour party to be given a role in Cameron's team.
