With Muhammad Ali and Snoop Dogg cheering you on in the freezing cold stands, the pressure was undoubtedly pretty high.

But Ali's grandson Biaggio Walsh and Snoop's son Cordell Broadus dominated the field, scoring two touchdowns each, to become Nevada high school state champions.

Snoop and Ali sat together at the game at Damonte High School in Reno, Nevada, as the Bishop Gorman High School earned a 70-28 victory over Reed High.

And incredibly, one of Walsh's touchdowns was a 91-yard run. 

After the result, the Las Vegas team finished their season ranked the best high school football team in the US. 

TMZ reported the sophomore, who is the son of Ali's daughter Rasheda, is set to be one of top running backs in the state next year.

Speaking about his grandfather's support, Walsh has previously said: 'He always tells me how proud he is of me. That makes me feel happy and strong.'
