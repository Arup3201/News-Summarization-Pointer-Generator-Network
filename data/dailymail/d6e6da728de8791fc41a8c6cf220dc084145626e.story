Neil Warnock is under investigation by the FA for his comments about referee Craig Pawson following Crystal Palace’s home defeat by Chelsea on Saturday.

The FA are looking at the interview during which Warnock claimed Pawson had been looking to ‘even up’ the teams by sending off Damien Delaney two minutes after showing a red card to Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta.

Warnock claimed the officials had been influenced by the Chelsea players, including John Terry, on Saturday

The Palace manager also claimed the officials was influenced by the Chelsea players and inferred they had been operating double-standards, failing to book John Terry but showing Delaney the first of his two yellow cards for a similar foul. The FA must rule on whether any of his comments have questioned the integrity of Pawson and his assistants, before deciding to charge him, issue an official warning or say there is no case to answer.

In his press conference, Warnock told reporters: ‘They buzzed me down from upstairs saying it’ll be evened up if we’re not careful. Delaney shouldn’t have given him a chance but it was wrong that four or five Chelsea players surrounded the referee. 

'I thought he was influenced by one or two things. John Terry’s (non) booking — if that’s one of my players, it’s a booking. I don’t understand why it’s not an even platform.’

Cesar Azpilicueta was shown a straight red card for a two-footed challenge on Mile Jedinak

Referee Craig Pawson then sent off Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney two minutes later 

Warnock has a history of disciplinary trouble for criticising referees but this is his first scrape since returning to Palace.

The FA are also looking into comments by Swansea manager Garry Monk after their defeat at Stoke on Sunday.

Monk criticised referee Michael Oliver for a ‘disgusting’ decision in awarding a penalty for a foul on Stoke’s Victor Moses, which the Swans boss claimed was a blatant dive.
