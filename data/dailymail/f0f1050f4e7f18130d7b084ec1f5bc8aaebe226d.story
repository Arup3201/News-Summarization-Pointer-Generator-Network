This shocking video, caught on a police helicopter, shows a 13-year-old boy on a motorbike leading officers on a high-speed pursuit through narrow residential streets.

Aerial footage shows the teenager fleeing from police on the back of the high-powered vehicle during the 30-minute chase.

West Midlands Police had tried to stop the youth after a family dialled 999 after nearly being run over by the bike in Druids Heath, Birmingham.

The footage, caught on a police helicopter, shows a 13-year-old boy on a motorbike leading officers on a high-speed pursuit on a motorbike in Birmingham

After dropping off two passengers, the teenager on the white Yamaha bike spots the police helicopter

He can then be seen dropping off two of his passengers who were also on the back of the white Yamaha bike after glancing up and spotting the police helicopter.

The teenager then speeds off down the estate swerving onto pavements and driveways while narrowly avoiding collisions with oncoming cars.

Moments later he falls from the bike after skidding on a patch of grass and is quickly chased on foot by a police officer.

Incredibly, he then somehow manages to avoid being captured and outruns the Pc who comes within inches from grabbing the youth.

The young rider finally gives himself up to another pursuing officer following the half-hour long chase on May 14 last year.

West Midlands Police released the dramatic 98-second clip yesterday as part of their 'NPAS helicopter year in review.'

A police spokesman said: 'The motorbike was tracked from above by the helicopter enabling officers on the ground to catch up with it.

'The 13-year-old riding the bike then made a run for it and after initially evading one officer was arrested by a second moments later.

'He was questioned about what happened and handed a police caution.'
