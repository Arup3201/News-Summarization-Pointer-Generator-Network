Passengers whose cruise aboard a Royal Caribbean vessel was cut short by a massive on-board fire have begun arriving back in Baltimore on charter flights from the Bahamas.

The  2,224 cruise passengers were forced to abandon their rooms after the massive fire broke out on the Grandeur of the Seas  on Monday morning as it made its way to the Bahamas.

Passengers
began flying back to Maryland on 11 flights chartered by the cruise 
line, while 25 passengers who did not want to fly were provided other 
transportation.

And while many holidaymakers have told how they feared the ship was going to sink, the passengers arriving in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon grinned and applauded the company's service.

'I'll never go on any other cruise line,' said Craig Dzubak, 26, of Pittsburgh, who was on his first cruise. 'They couldn't have handled it any better.'

He said he and his wife, Chelsea, were planning their next cruise while on the flight home.

Robert Alexander of Hamilton, New Jersey, said he was impressed by how well-prepared everyone on board was for emergencies.

An actor from the ship's theater made announcements to passengers after they were evacuated from their rooms, he said.

'It just shows the training they do,' Alexander said. 'Our head waiter at our dinner table was one of the first responders' to the fire.

Earlier, startling photos of the ship had emerged 
on social networking sites showing the entire stern of the vessel charred and 
destroyed, as passengers recounted their terrifying experiences.

'I heard these big explosions and saw the fire jump out of the ship,' passenger Dan McTigue told ABC News. 'We couldn't get to the muster station because it was on fire.'

'I started crying,' his granddaughter Sophia said. 'I thought we were gonna die.'

Passengers report that amid the chaos life preservers were distributed to several people as they waited in safety areas

The fire broke out on deck 3 and was quickly extinguished but the damage caused Royal Caribbean to cancel the cruise bound for the Bahamas

Damage: The blaze wiped out the stern of the Grandeur of the Seas as well as a bar and the resturant

No cause for the fire has been revealed, and authorities continue to investigate. A bar and a restaurant were also destroyed by the flames, which reached four decks.

Royal Caribbean said that the blaze began at 2.50am and was extinguished about two hours later with no injuries reported. They said all 2,224 guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for.

Royal Caribbean announced that the 2,224 passengers would be receiving a full refund and a gift certificate from the company. The company is also organizing flights for all passengers.

Twenty five passengers who do not want to fly will take a ferry to Fort Lauderdale, and then the train or bus to Baltimore, the company said on Twitter.

Bang Warren, one of the passengers who had to evacuate her room as a warning horn blared over the sound system, described the chaotic scene  to The Baltimore Sun.

'A lot of people were passing out with fear,' she said. She added that she saw crew members distributing oxygen masks and life vests: 'I know some children were vomiting.'

Grandeur of the Seas passenger Danielle Miller initially thought the ship was sinking as she filmed this footage

Waiting game: The passengers were given life jackets and told to wait in muster stations on the ship

Another passenger, Danielle Miller, 
23, said that she was sound asleep and was unaware of anything untoward 
until the ship's intercom asked passengers to put life jackets on.

'My first thought was that we were sinking,' said Danielle of her terror.

'I
opened the door and just see people running around with life jackets on
and we were being yelled at to get our life jackets on and run up to a 
deck that was two floors above us,' she told ABC News.

'But
we didn't know what was going on because when we were going to bed it 
was really stormy, so we honestly thought the boat might have been 
sinking. And we were just panicking and running upstairs.

'And we didn't know for about a half hour that there was a fire two decks below where we were at.'

According to several passenger accounts nobody was seriously injured but the fire did cause smoke and flooding

Miller revealed she was so nervous as the fire raged that her hands were shaking and her heart was pounding.

'A couple people fainted. People were throwing up, crying. Just anxiety attacks everywhere. I was just telling my roommate stay calm,' she said.

Royal Caribbean said that two guests were treated after fainting, and medical staff responded to reports of high blood pressure and an ankle sprain.

Nathan Pletscher spoke to ABC News to
explain how he became nervous for his parents aboard the ship only 
after he looked at a photo tweeted by Royal Caribbean's public relations
team.

'We originally saw a news article and
were a little nervous. When we made contact with my parents, they said 
there was a small fire,' he said.

'When I saw the photo on Twitter, I said, "That 
was a little more than a small fire." It's really fortunate the crew was
able to get fire under control and things of that nature.'

Speaking to the news network, 
Pletscher admitted that his parents had a 'sense of panic' and had 
become 'obviously nervous', but were calmed by the ships crew.

'When the alarm first went off, there
was an 'uh-oh' moment,' Pletscher said. 'But they couldn't say enough 
about how organized and professional both the captain and crew were. 
They kept everyone calm and were extremely transparent on with the whole
situation.'

The Twitter account for their public 
relations department announced they were in the process of scheduling 
passengers on flights to Baltimore.

Panic on the High Seas: Royal Caribbean said all guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for

Royal Caribbean has said they are in the process of arranging flights for the 2,224 guests currently aboard the ship

Firefighter Brian Goss, a passenger on the ship, told WOOD-TV that some of the cabins experienced flooding and that the hallways smelled of smoke for most of the morning.

But he praised the efforts of the company, and said they were working tirelessly on the situation: 'Up all night in emergency mode and now serving food and drinks with smiling faces and no sleep.'

An announcement from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship that passengers needed to go their muster stations roused Mark J. Ormesher from his stateroom on the Grandeur of the Seas early Monday.

Ormesher said in an email to The Associated Press that immediately after the captain's announcement, his room attendant knocked on the door and told him and his girlfriend to grab their flotation devices, saying: 'This was not a drill.'

The native of England, who lives in Manassas, Virginia, Ormesher said he and his girlfriend smelled acrid smoke as they went to their muster station, the ship's casino. He said the crew quickly provided instruction.

The company in a statement on its website said it is 'deeply sorry for this unexpected development in our guests' vacation. We understand that this may have been a very stressful time for them'

'This encouraged calm amongst the passengers,' he said.

Passengers were required to remain at their stations for four hours, he said, and the captain 'provided us as much information as we needed to stay safe.'

Ormesher, 25, and on his first cruise, said the air conditioner had been shut off, and as the hours passed and the ship got hot, bottled water was passed around.

The crew and passengers remained calm, and helped those who needed it. Crying babies were given formula and held while their parents used the bathrooms.

After passengers 
were allowed to leave their stations, Ormesher said he saw water on the 
outside of deck 5 and in the hallways. The mooring lines were destroyed 
he said; crew members brought new lines from storage.

Royal Caribbean said all 2,224 guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for

In Freeport, passenger Andrea Sanders
of Washington, D.C., said she slept on the deck with hundreds of other 
passengers as smoke billowed out of the stern of the ship. 'I was 
terrified with it being my first cruise,' Sanders told The Freeport News
as she ate lunch in port.

A spokesman for Royal Caribbean said: 'Royal Caribbean International is deeply sorry for this unexpected development in our guests' vacation.

'We understand that this may have been a very stressful time for them. And we also know that it has significantly impacted their vacation experience. We appreciate their patience and cooperation in dealing with this unfortunate situation.'

Royal Caribbean said in a statement 
on its website that most public areas and staterooms are safe and power,
propulsion and communications systems functioned without interruption.

Royal Caribbean International president and CEO Adam Goldstein met with passengers in Freeport.

A tweet sent from the NTSB shows they are investigating the situation

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a tweet that it will join the U.S. Coast Guard in investigating the fire.

Carnival Corp. also had trouble with fire aboard ship earlier this year.

The
900-foot Triumph was disabled during a February cruise by an engine 
room fire in the Gulf of Mexico, leaving thousands of passengers to 
endure cold food, unsanitary conditions and power outages while the ship
was towed to Mobile, Alabama.

It remained there for repairs until early May when it headed back to sea under its own power.
