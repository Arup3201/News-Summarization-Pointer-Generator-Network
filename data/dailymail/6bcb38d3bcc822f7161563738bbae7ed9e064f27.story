Industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new £1 coin could be more than £200million. 

The 12-sided coin, which resembles a classic threepenny bit, was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of £1 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some £45million a year.

But roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece, which is set to be introduced in 2017, according to one industry expert.

New design: The coin will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin. And the Government will embed luminescent particles  that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot

Upgrade: Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket self-service check-outs are among the roughly £1.2million machines that will need to be re-fitted

Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded.

Earlier this year, the Royal Mint suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around £20million. 

But company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much. 

Jonathan Hilder, CEO of the Automatic Vending Association, estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion £1 coins in circulation.

He said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines. 

The new coin  will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin.

will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement
 will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last 
circulated in 1971

And the Government will imbed tiny luminescent particles in the coin that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot. 

Mr Hilder said that, while the AVA agrees with the principle of introducing a new £1 coin, it also believes that the Government needs to do more to cover the cost of converting the machines.

He told MailOnline that it will cost £72.8million to adapt 450,000 coffee, snack and drink machines across the country. 

He added: 'We need a categorical assurance that there will be no upgrade of the 20p or 50p coins in the forseeable future', explaining that the move would lead to crippling costs for some. 

Costly: Earlier this year, it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £500 a time, which means converting every one across the UK would add up to £50million

Bacta, the body that represents the amusement industry, said that it will cost £100million to adapt 350,000 gaming machines. 

Chief executive John White said: 'This cost cannot be passed on to customers because of strict rules governing the relationship between stakes and winnings. 

'The industry is faced with a number of challenges already and our members, many of whom are small independent businesses, cannot afford this additional cost.' 

Earlier this year, it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £500 a time, which means converting every one across the UK  would add up to £50million.

The British Parking Association, whose members run car parks and on-street parking machines for councils and private firms estimated that the bills will be much higher.

The BPA has estimated that about 80,000 parking machines - 10,000 of which dispense change. 

In a statement it said: 'It is estimated that the simplest software upgrade on a pay and display machine will cost in the region of £90 to £130 per machine. 

If the validator requires changing, this can often also require new fixing brackets for the new validator and would cost in the region of £250 to £350 per machine. 

'On machines providing change, it will be considerably more.'  

However, the association said that one benefit of the change will be to stop around 40million counterfeit coins going in to parking machines each year, which would offset the cost.   

The British Retail Consortium told MailOnline today that it was working with the Mint and the Treasury on the project to ensure that there was a 'fair and sufficient implementation period'. 

A spokesman said that self-service check-outs, tills and weighting machines in the back office were among those that would need an upgrade. 

But he said that it was difficult to estimate a final total cost without receiving the final specifications. 

A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'After thirty year’s loyal service, the time is right to replace the current £1 coin with a new, more secure coin that will reduce the costs of counterfeiting to our economy. 

'It is the small and medium businesses that feel the costs the most and ultimately, the costs of bringing in the new coin could never compare to the price we’d pay in the event that confidence in the £1 coin deteriorated. 

'That’s why the government is acting now, to stay several steps ahead of the counterfeiters. In doing that, we are committed to arriving at a final specification of the coin that maximises the benefits to the UK and to introducing the new coin in a manageable way for industry. 

'That is why we have been undertaking a full consultation with all interested parties, which will determine the final specification of the coin.'

In September, George Osborne launched a competition for members of the public to design what goes on the tails of the new 12-sided £1 coin. 

This unique opportunity will put a design on millions of new £1 coins while the winner will receive a £10,000 fee in exchange for the right to use it. 

But the contest, which is now closed, sparked the creation of a number of spoof coins - with pranksters posting designs using Mr Blobby, Alex Salmond and the Chuckle Brothers to Twitter.
