Bishop of London Richard Chartres said: 'After the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm¿ at Baroness Thatcher's funeral

The Bishop of London paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher yesterday by saying that ‘after the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm’. He added: ‘Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all.’

The funeral address by the Right Reverend Richard Chartres was the centrepiece of a simple service; at Lady Thatcher’s own request there were no eulogies.

His words delighted the former prime minister’s allies and prompted tears and laughter as he applauded her strength of character and Methodist faith.

He also debunked controversy over  the most provocative quote of Baroness Thatcher’s career – that there is ‘no such thing as society’.

In an address deemed perfectly pitched by her closest friends in politics, the bishop hailed her as a ‘mythological figure’ and went out of his way to draw a line under the comment that has been a millstone around Tory necks since she delivered it in 1987 – setting it in its proper context.

He said the former premier had referred to the Christian doctrine, ‘that we are  all members one of another, expressed  in the concept of the Church on earth as the Body of Christ’.

‘From this we learn our interdependence and the great truth that we do not achieve happiness or salvation in isolation from each other but as members of society,’ he quoted her saying.

‘Her later remark about there being no such thing as “society” has been misunderstood, and refers to some impersonal entity to which we are tempted to surrender our independence,’ he explained.

‘She was very aware there are prior dispositions which are needed to make market economics and democratic institutions function well: the habits of  truth-telling, mutual sympathy, and  the capacity to co-operate. These dispositions are incubated and given power by our relationships.

‘In her words, “the basic ties of the family are at the heart of our society and are the very nursery of civic virtue”.’

Conservative MP Ben Wallace, an aide to minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke, said: ‘The Bishop of London chose to dispel one of the Left’s many smears that Mrs Thatcher didn’t believe in society. It is a long overdue correction.’ 

The bishop paid tribute to Lady Thatcher’s ‘courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her, as well as her capacity to reach out to the young, and often also to those who were not, in the world’s eyes, “important”.’

He added that it was important to debate Lady Thatcher’s policies and legacy and to assess the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals  and communities.

But he insisted: ‘Parliament held a frank debate last week – but here and today is neither the time nor the place. This, at Lady Thatcher’s personal request, is a funeral service, not a memorial service with the customary eulogies.

‘At such a time, the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician; instead this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling.

‘It is also the place for the simple truths which transcend political debate. Above all it is the place for hope.’

He said she described her religious upbringing in a lecture she gave in the nearby church of St Lawrence Jewry: ‘Her upbringing, of course, was in Methodism to which this country owes a huge debt. When it was time to challenge the political and economic status quo in 19th century Britain, it was so often the Methodists who took the lead.’

The Bishop pointed out it was the Methodist tradition that inspired the Tolpuddle Martyrs, who, in protest at wage cuts, formed the first trade union.
