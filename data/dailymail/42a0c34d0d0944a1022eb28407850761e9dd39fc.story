Chelsea are coasting at the top of the Premier League table and they are also leading the way when it comes to Vine followers in the English game.

The West London club's Vine account has the most followers - 102,400 - in the Premier League, followed by Arsenal (86,900) and Manchester United (83,700).

Twitter's short video service Vine has boomed in popularity in the last couple of years, and all bar four Premier League sides have an account according to Digiday.

Arsenal (left) and Manchester United have the second and third most Vine followers respectively

Vine has been utilised in many different ways be Premier League sides, including showing behind the scenes footage, community projects, team line-ups and up-coming events.

Interestingly, Brandsonvine has also compiled figures of which Premier League sides have had the most 'loops' - the amount of times the short video has been played on a 'loop', not necessarily how many views it has received.

Again, Chelsea are far and away the leaders of this list with 15,235,236 loops, with Liverpool second (3,754,877) and Manchester City third (3,753,636).

Only the LA Lakers basketball team and the LA Dodgers baseball side have had more 'loops' worldwide.

The Blues' three most-viewed Vines are manager Jose Mourinho's Ice Bucket Challenge (4.5million loops), midfielder Cesc Fabregas' welcome to Chelsea (1.6m loops) and Didier Drogba's return to the club (1.2m loops).
