Despite protestations of public loyalty from senior Labour figures, behind the scenes even shadow cabinet members who still believe in Ed Miliband (and they are rapidly decreasing in number) are pressing for a change in style and direction.

They know Miliband neither looks nor sounds the part of the Leader of the Opposition, let alone Prime Minister-in-waiting.

With six months to the election, there is pressure from those shadow ministers for senior MPs and trade union leaders to see Miliband in private and persuade him to make way for a caretaker leader like Alan Johnson, former home secretary, because there is no mechanism to force a leadership ballot so close to an election.

Despite assurances from Ed Miliband that his party is on course for an election victory in 2015, behind closed doors shadow ministers are said to be calling for him to step aside

One senior Labour source said: ‘The calls are pouring into the Chief Whip’s office … colleagues, some shadow ministers, with 5,000 majorities … who are terrified Ukip will defeat them, or … hand seats to the Tories. 

'We had nothing to say in the Middleton by-election on immigration, which was a big issue.’

It’s hardly surprising Labour MPs had no ammunition on immigration. Miliband ‘forgot’ to mention it in his conference speech – along with the deficit.

His close-knit kitchen cabinet of aides and advisers are still in denial about the extent of the Ukip threat. Utterly sycophantic, they often greet him with applause even after a badly received speech, and there are plenty of those.

Huddled in their bunker, they are as out of touch with Labour MPs as Miliband is with voters in the party’s heartlands.

Bizarrely, he has viewed the rise of Ukip solely as a problem for the Tories, even though Nigel Farage’s party have come second to Labour in five by-elections in this parliament. 

There is pressure for Miliband to hand caretaker leadership to the likes of former Home Secretary Alan Johnson

Heywood and Middleton was only 148th on Ukip’s list of targets.

In his conference speech, Miliband made only one reference to Nigel Farage’s party by mocking David Cameron for caring more about Ukip than the UK. But the joke is now on him.

Confidence is draining from Miliband. He sounded tetchy and rattled in interviews yesterday and looked tired. He is braced for a difficult weekend with more MPs making public attacks.

The problem is that in a party once synonymous with flat caps and coal miners, one in four Labour MPs used to work at Westminster, with no experience of the real world. 

One shadow cabinet member who defended Miliband on the radio was overheard saying afterwards: ‘I have been trying for so long to get Ed’s team to do something about our core voters to stop Ukip, but it’s not getting through.’

Miliband is losing authority over his shadow cabinet. The New Statesman reported yesterday that he wanted to cut university tuition fees to £6,000. 

But the magazine was briefed that Miliband had been blocked from making the change by shadow cabinet members. Earlier, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it was a ‘mistake’ for Miliband to omit the deficit in his conference speech.

The truth is Miliband is now a lame duck leader, a prisoner of his shadow cabinet and the trade unions. Labour MPs panicking about their seats have only got themselves to blame for not doing anything about him when they had the chance.

It’s too late to get rid of him now – unless the big beasts of the party make him an offer he can’t refuse.
