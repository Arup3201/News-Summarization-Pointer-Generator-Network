Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes England will soon be playing in a World Cup final, as the Three Lions have greater resources than any other nation.

The centre back even compared England favourably to Germany, and said imminent English success was ‘inevitable’.

Kompany told Sky Sports News: ‘The future is bright. England will have a shot at playing a World Cup final. I've seen the development. I was in Germany when it [their development] happened.

‘I see the same kind of movement here - but times 10. The clubs didn't have the development for youth before.

‘No one has more resources than England now to take the next steps. It's inevitable (England’s success).’

The Belgian, who helped his country get to the last eight of this summer’s World Cup, has noticed a change in mentality at Manchester City that he feels bodes well for future England glory.

He said: ‘What I've seen at City is that youth formation is a priority. I'm looking at City - the coaches are being coached.

‘No other country has got the resources like England to go to a level that anyone has ever achieved.’

The defender added that he is confident the Citizens will defend their Premier League title. ‘We know what to look out for, we know what not to do,’ he said.

‘The players at City have got experience with winning trophies. It goes in phases. We're in this phase now – we feel we can win it.’

Kompany was less willing to discuss Wayne Rooney’s appointment as United captain, and said: ‘I'm very focused on Man City, so in the softest way [of saying this] I couldn't care less.’
