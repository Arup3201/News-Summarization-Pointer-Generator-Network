The NHS body that rations life-saving drugs has spent tens of thousands on taxpayer-funded credit cards.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence spent £78,000 on government procurement cards last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.

They were used by staff to travel ‘for business purposes’ to destinations including Rio de Janeiro, Vietnam, California, South Korea, Chicago and Prague.

But the documents reveal they were also used for such unlikely purchases as a box of toilet brushes and sink plungers at £16.92, an inflatable cushion at £11.10 for a member of staff with a sore tail-bone, a £49.99 Christmas tree from Argos and seasonal decorations costing £7.99.

They were also used to pay for morale-boosting staff ‘away days’, including one costing £751 at the Eden Bar and Restaurant in Manchester and another worth £379.77 at the city’s Victorian Chop House.

Other expenses included Marks & Spencer gift tokens used as prizes for staff quizzes, as well as wheat and gluten-free sandwiches from the upmarket chain.

The cards were used to buy a tablecloth for £19.98 and a vacuum cleaner for £27.99, both from Robert Dyas, as well as dishwasher tablets (£7) and dishwasher cleaning fluid (£4.44) from Tesco.

Officials also used the cards at Sainsbury’s to pay for fruit juice, milk and biscuits ‘for meetings’.

Nice agreed to publish details of its 
spending only after several Freedom of Information requests from the 
Mail, our sister paper the Mail on Sunday and the TaxPayers’ Alliance.

When the Mail first asked for the information in September, we were told Nice ‘does not use government procurement cards’.

When the organisation finally acknowledged their use, it pointed out its bill was much lower than those of other public bodies.

Last month the Mail revealed the Health Protection Agency had used the cards to spend £3.1million in two years on items such as golf equipment, clogs, nail care and even a prawn-peeling machine.

And the Government Offices for the Regions quango was found to have blown £5million in three years on items including video games, yoga and skiing trips.

There are thought to be around 140,000 government procurement cards in circulation and civil servants used them to spend £1billion last year alone.

Nice said about 14 of its senior members of staff had the cards.

Sir Andrew Dillon, the organisation’s chief executive, said: ‘Government procurement cards and other credit cards are only used when it is difficult to make a payment any other way and their use is subject to strict guidelines.

'All our expenditure is for business purposes.’
