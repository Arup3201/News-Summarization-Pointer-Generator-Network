A judge who praised burglars for their 'courage' before letting a serial offender walk free from court is facing an official investigation as David Cameron waded into the row.

Judge Peter Bowers took the astonishing decision not to lock up Richard Rochford after saying that prison ‘very rarely does anybody any good’.

‘It takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s house,’ he told Rochford. ‘I wouldn’t have the nerve.’

Ruckas: David Cameron used an interview on ITV this morning to attack a judge who freed a burglar, admitting that he has been burgled twice and the crime showed 'cowardice'

Rochford, 26, who could have been 
jailed for two-and-a-half years, was instead handed a suspended 12-month
 prison term.  ‘I’m going to take a chance on you,’ the 67-year-old 
judge told him.

The comments sparked a wave of anger 
from victims and campaigners, and prompted criticism from the Prime 
Minister, himself a victim of two burglaries, and Rochford’s own mother.

Several complaints have been made to the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) which has launched an investigation.

If the complaints are upheld, Judge Bowers could face disciplinary action.

On ITV’s Daybreak programme, Mr 
Cameron said he had not read the full details of the case but added: ‘I 
am very clear that burglary is not bravery. Burglary is cowardice. 
Burglary is a hateful crime. People sometimes say it is not a violent 
crime, but actually if you have been burgled, you do feel it was 
violence.

‘I have a very clear view about this, 
which is burglary is a despicable and hateful crime. People who 
repeatedly burgle should be sent to prison.’

Tory MP Philip Davies criticised the 
judge in the Commons, saying: ‘How can we ensure that idiots like that 
do not remain in the judiciary?’

Rochford himself said last night said 
he did not consider himself brave. The burglar said: ‘I feel bad for 
what I did. It won’t make up for what I’ve done but I am sorry.

‘I don’t think burglary is a 
courageous thing to do. I felt awful about it, to be honest, but I can 
barely remember even doing it. I was on 60 to 70 valium tablets a day at
 the time.’

Even Rochford’s mother failed to agree
 with the judge. Caroline Whitehouse said: ‘To say what the judge said 
is out of order. You don’t call a burglary courageous. I’m ashamed of 
what he’s done. The judge shouldn’t have said that because it causes so 
much trouble. It’s not courage – I think it’s wrong, it’s low to burgle 
someone.’

Rochford admitted to a burglary spree 
in February. The offences were his first burglary convictions, although 
he was cautioned for burgling a home at the age of ten. He has 
previously been jailed for three years for arson.
