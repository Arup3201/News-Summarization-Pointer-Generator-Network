Fifteen sex offenders are living in the same street as a number of residential homes for vulnerable children, a government minister has revealed.

Vulnerable children are being sent to residential homes in Margate, pictured, in the same street as known sex offenders

Too many privately-run children's homes are near high numbers of registered sex offenders, the childrne's minister Tim Loughton has said

He warned yesterday that privately-owned homes have 
become dumping grounds for unwanted children where they are ‘out of 
sight, out of mind’.

Thousands of children have gone missing from 
hundreds of homes which have too often been given a clean bill of health
by Ofsted even though the teenage residents have been exposed to sexual
abuse.

The violence, sadism and exploitation these youngsters are subjected to was described as ‘chilling’ and ‘truly horrific’

Children's minister Tim Loughton said vulnerable children are at risk
