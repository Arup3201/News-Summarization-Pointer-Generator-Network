Susan Sarandon may be a mother-of-three and new grandmother-of-one, but in a new interview she reveals she was told she would never be able to have children after being diagnosed with endometriosis.

The actress, now 67, told Terri White, editor-in-chief of Time Out New York, that she had 'gone for years and years and years without using birth 
control, with the explanation from these doctors.'

And while the condition had not devastated her as it might another woman, she welcomed the opportunity when she became pregnant while dating Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri in 1984.

Susan Sarandon, now a mother-of-three and new grandmother-of-one, has revealed she was once told she would never be able to have children

'I was ready to do it on my own, even 
though a lot of people counseled me against it - that it would be the end 
of my career,' she said.

'It was just such a freak [thing] that I got pregnant that I
 thought I can’t ignore this. And so I jumped. I had to pay 
attention when it happened, because nobody could understand how it had 
happened.'

Ms Sarandon's daughter, Eva, was born in 1985 - the first of three children - she went on to have two sons (Jack, now 25, and Miles, now 22) with ex-husband Tim Robbins.

On the idea of becoming a grandmother, she admitted: 'I feel a little like I did when I was pregnant. You go about physically dealing with it and rationally dealing with it, but there’s some part of your brain that can’t wrap itself around this idea that your child, that your daughter, is going to have a daughter. I mean, it’s just so beautiful and huge.'

Not that the actress will be a traditional grandmother. In addition to being rather more glamorous and famous than the average woman, she told People earlier this year that she would like her granddaughter to call her Honey.

'I borrowed this name from a very dear friend of mine who’s from the South, and his grandma was "Honey,"' she said. 'That’s what I’m experimenting with, and Eva likes it, so we’ll see.'

Ms Sarandon is now dating Jonathan Bricklin, 36, her co-investor in ping-pong bar Spin.

She told Time Out of their relationship: I think the sexiest thing you can possibly do is to create with another person. And that doesn’t even mean there has to be sex involved. If I’m doing a film and it’s a collaborative situation that is rich and makes you think outside the box and surprises you, it’s just a wonderful planet to be on.'
