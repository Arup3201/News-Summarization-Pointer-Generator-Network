A young man who tried to take a selfie right next to the tracks while a huge locomotive passed by him has learned the hard way why it's a bad idea.

Jared Michael received a well-deserved boot to his head from the train's engineer who yelled at him as he motored past the foolish would-be photographer.

Uploading the video to YouTube, Michael attempted to explain that he 'tried to take a selfie while a train passed a 'safe' distance behind'. But conceded, 'I guess I was still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up'.

Selfie time: The young man prepares his angles for the picture of a train he is planning

However, despite his admission of a lesson well-learned following the engineer's justified swing, Michael's first reaction as captured in his video is amazement.

Instead of saying 'Ow!', or 'Maybe I was too close to the train', Michael exclaims, 'Wow! I got kicked in the head! I think I got that on film!'

Here it comes: The train appears in view as the young man no doubt is getting excited about his upcoming picture

Here comes trouble: The train's engineer appears on the side of the train ready to kick the kid

Follow-through: The train speeds past and the young man's head feels the full force of the conductors boot

But, before everyone holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now go to for the perfect selfie, some have joked they see the hand at work of America's prankster in chief, Jimmy Kimmel.

Indeed, Cooper Fleishman, the editor of the Dailydot tweeted that he would find it amusing if the video was revealed to be a set-up, filmed on an ABC studio lot and that the engineer was in fact Kimmel.

The ABC late-night host has a past history for viral internet pranks - during the Sochi Winter Olympics he managed to get a picture of a wolf roaming the athletes village to go viral.

In fact it was a fake, but that did not stop multiple outlets running with the image.

That really hurt: The young man feels his face after his kick
