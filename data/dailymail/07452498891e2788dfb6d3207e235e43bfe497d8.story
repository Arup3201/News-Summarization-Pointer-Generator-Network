A  £100,000 futuristic hospital bed is helping critically-ill George Michael fight severe pneumonia.

He was rushed to the AKH hospital in Vienna a week ago after falling ill during his European tour.

On Saturday, Professor Dr Christoph Zielinski and Professor Dr Thomas Staudinger, who are looking after the singer around the clock, said: ‘George Michael has severe community acquired pneumonia and is being 
treated as an in-patient.

‘His condition has stabilised and he is responding to treatment.'

However, yesterday morning The Sun claimed Mr Michael 
had developed acute respiratory distress - a dangerous new complication that stops oxygen getting 
into the blood and can often prove fatal.

The
 Wham! star is now being treated on a Triadyne Proventa bed, which is 
for people with pneumonia who are unable to move. His family are believed to be by his bedside.

Dr Carol Cooper, told the paper: 'The bed has probably saved his life so far. But he is far from out of the woods yet.'

The futuristic bed, which measures 7ft 6in by 3ft 5in, mimics the body’s 
natural movements to improve blood and lymph flow. It is also equipped with sophisticated technology to reduce 
pressure on the patient's lungs.

The bed holds them securely in place using moulded foam, while special Gore medical fabric creates a barrier against bacteria.

It rotates the patient from side to side at 40 degrees or more to increase oxygenation of the blood and stop fluid building up in the lungs.

It has an integrated scale to measure the patient's weight as well as an airflow system that helps maintain skin temperature control and manage moisture levels.

The Triadyne can also transform into a chair or rotate fully upright to 
enable medical staff to take chest X-rays.

A doctor told Austrian daily Osterreich: 'He is still in intensive care and his condition remains critical. The next 48 hours are going to be crucial in George Michael's recovery.'

He added that it was very possible the singer could still be in hospital at Christmas.

George Michael is believed to have fallen ill in his suite at Vienna’s exclusive Imperial Hotel on Monday.

After a doctor was called, he was immediately taken to the city’s Rudolfinerhaus private hospital.

Doctors later decided to transfer him 
to Vienna’s AKH hospital, which has the advanced specialist facilities 
to treat his illness.

He is being treated in a special ward at the hospital used by Austrian politicians and VIPs when they are seriously ill.

A
statement from his publicist stressed that he has pneumonia 
and said any other speculation regarding his illness was ‘unfounded and 
untrue’.

It added Michael 
had been told by doctors it was unclear how long he would take to 
recover and he could not continue with his Symphonica tour because he would need complete rest.

Ear, Nose and Throat specialist Gerrit Wohlt who has treated many famous opera and pop stars said the illness could have a terrible effect on his voice.

'It depends how long he spends on the ventilator, but in the worst case scenario his illness could seriously affect his singing capacity.

'The pressure put on his throat by the ventilator is very close to his vocal cords and in the worst case scenario could affect them,' said Dr Wohlt.

Dr Wohlt continued: 'He could end up with a hoarse voice either short term or long term. A comeback in the new year is unlikely. George Michael will need months of rest and recuperation.'

All 14 remaining dates have been postponed, including three concerts at Earl’s Court as a finale before Christmas.

The latest cancellations come after 
Michael had to call off one of his concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 
London after being hit by a viral infection. That concert has now been 
rescheduled for next May.

Regular tweeter Michael has also been conspicuously absent from his Twitter page since November 17.

He announced the 65-show tour of Europe in May – three years after he said he would quit live performance.

At the time, the singer, who spent a 
month in prison for drug-driving last year, told a press conference: ‘I 
felt very re-energised after my recent troubles.

‘I felt it was really what I want to do as an artist.’
