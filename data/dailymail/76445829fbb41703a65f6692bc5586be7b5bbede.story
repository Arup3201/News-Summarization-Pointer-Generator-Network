A gay rights activist who caused a national panic on social media when he posted that he had been kidnapped has been found- and charged with faking his own abduction.

Adam Hoover, 20, from Cincinnati, Ohio, the co-president of Marriage Equality Ohio, sent out a post on Twitter and Facebook Monday evening saying that he had been taken by individuals who were keeping him in the trunk of his car and threatening to kill him and his family.

The post was quickly picked up by thousands across the country, most notably LGBT advocate Tyler Oakley, who shared the young man's cry for help with his 3.8million Twitter followers.

Hoover was found safe in the trunk of his car some time later, and then, early this morning, charged with faking the entire incident.

'Please help me I'm in the trunk of my ford escort red,' Hoover posted last night, including the license plate number of his car, his mother's phone number and the stretch of road where police could find the automobile.

'They said they are going to kill my family please call 911 I don't want them to hear me. Please please call. I don't want to die.'

Authorities did find him, shortly after, thanks to the widespread support and outreach conducted on social media, but, according to WLWT, determined soon after that the entire abduction had been orchestrated by Hoover.

It is not known if he had any accomplices in the alleged hoax.

Hoover's mother seemed to confirm these charges when she posted on his Facebook account Tuesday morning; 'This is Adams mom Anna. Thank you for your support and prayers. I have a special request. Social media is powerful. Could every please remove posts and tags and give us some time to figure this all out. Adam has helped so many please help me help him.'

Police would not reveal how they learned that Hoover had faked the kidnapping, and the young man left the station at 7am Tuesday morning without making a comment to the media.

The young man has been charged with making false alarms, a first-degree misdemeanor. 

Marriage Equality Ohio and GLAAD did not respond to requests for comment.
