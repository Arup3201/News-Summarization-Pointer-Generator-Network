It is perhaps fitting that these prisons - which US convicts would once have called home - have themselves been abandoned and left to rot.

The images, taken by US photographer Matthew Christopher, show two deserted institutions: Old Essex County Jail in Newark, New Jersey, and Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia.

The 35-year-old has captured the sense of despair that so many of the lags incarcerated behind the walls of the two jails would almost certainly have felt. It is as if the prisons themselves have been sentenced to a lifetime of rust.

Philadelphia's county jail, Holmesburg Prison, earned a reputation for brutal conditions. A 1922 expose by the Evening Public Ledger branded it 'the worst prison in the United States.

Built in 1896, prisoners were often kept in solitary confinement and only allowed 20 minutes of exercise each day.

According to website Hidden City, the prison was exposed for the 'bake-oven murders' in 1938. Guards were found to have been putting prisoners into a small building fitted with steam radiators, where they would turn up the heat to full blast.

Inmates called it the 'Klondike'. Four prisoners died one hot August weekend, after temperatures inside reached almost 200 degrees.

An investigation by the governor of Pennsylvania following a local police cover-up resulted in involuntary manslaughter convictions for the deputy warden and guard.

In the 1950s, medical testing a programme of medical testing began at Holmesburg. Hidden city claims experiments were carried out on inmates on behalf of private clients.

The CIA was also said to have tested more than a dozen psychotropic drugs there during the course of a decade. The programme ended in 1974.

In 1973, two prisoners stabbed warden Patrick Curran and his deputy Robert Fromhold to death. The current county jail, Curran-Fromhold Correctional Center, was named after them.

Holmesburg finally closed its doors in 1995.

The Old Essex County Jail Complex was designed by architect John Haviland and opened its doors in 1837.

Also
 known as Newark Street Jail, it was located over two storeys and had 
300 cells, with each one fitted with running water and toilet 
facilities.

But when a new prison was opened in 1970, Old Essex was closed down.

According to Forbidden Places website, it is the oldest building in the county and is on the national register of historic places.

In 1991 scenes for the Malcolm X, a film starring Denzil Washington, were shot at the prison.

Ten years later a fire took hold in the building causing considerable damage.

Nothing
 is being done to bring the building back into use, and it is said to be
 a retreat for squatters, dealers and drug-addicts.

Matthew, who lives in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began his journey to document abandoned 
sites a decade ago while researching the decline of the state hospital 
system.

He said: 'I 
want to be able to convey the respect, appreciation and awe that I have 
for the locations I visit. Trying to tell someone about a place conveys 
so little compared to being able to show it to them.

'My
 favourite part of exploring ruins is that to me, it is peaceful. I can 
focus on what I am seeing and experiencing rather than being wrapped up 
in my thoughts all the time.

'Discovering
 new or intriguing places, finding something you know not many people 
have seen, or managing to get permission to somewhere you'd really like 
to see are also a lot of fun.

'These places also help me appreciate the comforts of the waking world when I return to it.'

Realising that words alone could not adequately convey the harsh realities of institutional care, Matthew embarked on a journey to visit and photograph crumbling state schools and asylums all over the US.

Ten years later, Matthew's focus has broadened to include the ruins of American infrastructure, industry, churches, schools, theaters, hospitals, prisons, resorts and hotels.

He Added: 'The Baltimore Gas and Electric's Westport Power Station was a favourite of mine, but I love different things about each place I've visited.

'Sometimes it can get scary, especially if a place is really structurally unstable, that would probably be my biggest concern. I also don't want to get murdered for my camera gear or arrested.

'There have been several occasions where I have had close calls with security and police, but thankfully nothing that has ever proven to be a long-term issue.

'I try to be very quiet and careful to avoid anybody when I am photographing a location, and if I do run into anyone am polite and respectful, I try to get across the fact that I am not vandalising, damaging, or stealing anything. I have been lucky that so far that has been enough.'

Derelict: Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia has been abandoned for so long, even the graffiti is now peeling off the wall along with the plaster

From Taunton State Hospital in Massachusetts to the US Air Force's aircraft graveyard in Tucson, Arizona, Matt's extensive collection of derelict sites is one of the largest ever amassed.

His work has gained international attention and he is considered a leading expert on urban blight and the efforts to preserve America's endangered architectural history.

'I do quite a bit of research about the locations to try to find them. I also get tips from people who follow my work, and network with others who have similar interests.

'I am very fortunate to have a fantastic family that has never discouraged me from doing what I do and has been very supportive of it all along.

'Many of my friends are the same way, although there are certainly those that just don't find it interesting or follow it as much and we get along for other reasons.

'My current goal is figuring out new ways to make sites more accessible and raise funds for site maintenance or restoration efforts, as well as continuing to add to the amount of locations I photograph.

'I am typically pretty busy, always working out how to take things one step further and help people understand what is so important about them, both historically and in terms of their cultural significance to our own era.'
