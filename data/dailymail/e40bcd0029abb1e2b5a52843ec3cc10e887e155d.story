A reduced-fare program has launched for commuters in Seattle's metropolitan area offering transit tickets based on income.

The ORCA (One Regional Card For All) Lift program provides a discounted rate of $1.50 per trip for residents using public transportation earning less than 200 per cent of the federal poverty rate, which is currently $23,340 per person.

As the metropolitan area's Metro fares increased for the fifth time since 2008 today, the program was created with the hopes that public transit would remain accessible for those who cannot afford the higher prices.

In the second program of its kind in the nation, residents are eligible for the two-year long ORCA cards based on particular maximum household incomes (above a chart illustrating the maximum income for households to qualify for the ORCA Lift program)

The program, run by King County Metro Transit, is unique because it relies on health clinics and organizations that signed up people for ObamaCare to enroll residents for ORCA Lift

The program, run by King County Metro Transit, is unique because it relies on health clinics and organizations that signed up people for ObamaCare  to enroll residents for ORCA Lift.

This is why Seattle resident Basro Jama, 27, a single mom and an immigrant from Somalia, received her card last week while at the doctor with her two children, according to the New York Times.

Jama, who earns less than $25,000 a year after taxes, will now save at least ten dollars on commuting costs each week with her ORCA Lift card. 

In the second program of its kind available on a large-scale in the nation, residents are eligible for the cards, which are active for two years, based on particular maximum household incomes.

For example, a family of three with a maximum income of $39,580 would be able to apply for the program, as would a family of five with maximum income of $55,820.

'ORCA Lift will help people across our region get to work and school each day even as bus fares continue to rise,' said King County Executive Dow Constantine. 

'By taking advantage of the strong network of community partners that we've built in recent years, we're making it convenient for riders to find out if they qualify for this new opportunity.'

The first group of residents to sign up took place last week, and the program could possibly reach 100,000 people. Seattle resident Justin Bonzai shared on Twitter (above) that he received his ORCA Lift card on Friday

Some residents who do not qualify for the program have shared bitter feelings. Resident Lynn Sellick-Lane shared on Twitter (above) that if you do not qualify for ORCA Lift, 'you get to pay for everyone who does'

The first group of residents enrolled in the program  last week, and it is reported the benefits could reach between 45,000 and 100,000 people, according to the Seattle Times. Around 1,000 people already received the card.

Seattle resident Justin Bonzai shared on Twitter that he received his ORCA Lift card on Friday. 

He wrote: 'Yay I got the ORCA Lift card (discount bus trips) $1.50 for a bus ride instead of $2.75. Awesome.'

But some residents who do not qualify for the program have shared bitter feelings. Resident Lynn Sellick-Lane shared on Twitter that if you do not qualify for ORCA Lift, 'you get to pay for everyone who does'. 

The program, created through a joint effort between Constantine and Metropolitan King County Council, has been characterized as a 'safety valve'.

The fare changes are aimed to bring a balance between bringing in a revenue that will support Metro service while keeping bus trips affordable for people with low incomes

The fare changes are aimed to bring a balance between bringing in a revenue that will support Metro service while keeping bus trips affordable for people with low incomes, according to KING5.

Between 1999 and 2012, 95 per cent of King County's new households have been earning either more than $125,000 or less than $33,000 with hardly any middle ground, said Constantine.

He said: 'It's people doing really well, and people making espresso for people who are doing really well.'

Even if commuters are qualified for the reduced fare program, but then start earning more than the 200 per cent of the federal poverty, they can still reap the benefits until their ORCA card expires

The reduced fare will provide 50 percent or more off fares to income-qualified riders which is applied to their travel on Metro Transit buses, Sound Transit Link light rail, and the Seattle Streetcar. 

And even if commuters are qualified for the reduced fare program, but then start earning more than the 200 per cent of the federal poverty, they can still reap the benefits until their ORCA card expires.

As the fares increased 25 cents today on King County Metro Transit, the raised prices are part of a larger problem impacting America's public transportation systems.

It was reported that more than 70 per cent of the country's transit systems raised fares or cut services since the recession, according to the American Public Transportation Association.

While Seattle rolls out its ORCA Lift program, it is not the first of its kind.

In 2005, San Francisco delivered its Muni Lifeline fare program but it currently only has less than 20,000 card holders - within a system that provides services to  350,000 people a day.

Programs on a smaller scale have been launched in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

But all eyes will remain focused on Seattle as other states watch to see how the program unfolds. 

'Metro is only the second large transit system in the country to roll out a fare of this type,' said Metro General Manager Kevin Desmond. 

'I am proud that we are able to step up to ensure continued access to bus service for those who need it the most.'
