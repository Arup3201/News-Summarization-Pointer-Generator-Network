The roof of a double-decker bus was torn off and left lying in the middle of the street after its driver crashed it into a low railway bridge.

Three people were injured when the bus - which was not carrying passengers at the time - hit the structure in front of shocked commuters in Chelmsford, Essex.

The impact tore off the entire roof of the vehicle, which was left in a heap on the road surrounded by broken glass.

Damage: The roof of this bus was torn off when it was driven into a low railway bridge in Chelmsford, Essex

Torn: Luckily no passengers were on board at the time of the crash, which left the entire top deck exposed

Injuries: Three people were injured when the bus, which was not carrying passengers at the time, hit the bridge - leaving the smashed roof lying in the street

After the collision, which took place at 4.30pm yesterday, the driver carried 
on for a short distance to the city bus station, leaving the roof of his
bus
lying in the road next to the bridge.

Those hurt suffered minor injuries and were taken by ambulance to the city’s Broomfield Hospital, while the bus driver was treated for shock at scene close to the city’s railway station.

Police confirmed this morning that the driver, who has not been named, has been reported for a motoring offence - meaning he is likely to be prosecuted.

Rail services were delayed for a short period as engineers carried out structural examinations on the bridge to ensure it was safe for trains to pass overhead.

Student Mark Marshall, 18, saw the aftermath of the crash said it was 'like being on the set of a movie.'

'How nobody was seriously injured is beyond me,' he said. 'If it had been full of passengers on the top deck then people would surely have died. The bus roof was sliced open by the bridge like a knife going through butter.'

Witness Harriet Minns said: 'I had been waiting to get onto my bus when I heard the bang. I turned round just in time to see the bus - it was going quite fast and looked like it was unable to stop.

'There was a huge cloud of dust which came up and bricks flew everywhere off the railway bridge. People started rushing off other nearby buses and were screaming. There was then a sort of silence as shock mixed with panic.'

An Essex Police spokesman said officers were investigating the circumstances leading to the crash and that the driver had been reported for a driving offence.
