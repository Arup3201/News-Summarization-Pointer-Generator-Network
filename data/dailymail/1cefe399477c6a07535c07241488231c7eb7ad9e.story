Last Christmas cyber criminals made £12million from online fraud in the UK and IT security experts are warning shoppers that unless they take precautions thieves will be in for a bumper haul again.

Research reveals that far too many people have a cavalier attitude to staying safe online and Security Minister James Brokenshire has warned shoppers to stay vigilant.

His advice comes as 34 million people prepare to log on to buy gifts and ahead of Cyber Monday, when festive online shopping peaks.

Careless: 27 per cent admit that they don¿t take precautionary measures to protect their finances online

Between November 1 2012 and February 
28 Action Fraud received 11,161 reports of online fraud, with the 
average loss to each victim being £1,700.

These
 crimes netted cyber criminals some £12million. The Christmas fraud 
figures run to March because for many online festive shoppers, it's not 
immediately apparent that they've been fleeced.

Since last December, according to research conducted by 
Barclays, Kaspersky Lab and Getsafeonline.org, more than four million 
people have been conned online, with a staggering 
£1.5billion lining the pockets of cyber thieves in total.

Potential targets during last year's festive season included iPhones, iPads, games consoles like the Nintendo 3DS, as well as designer gear such as Ugg boots, Nike trainers, Jimmy Choos, and jewellery such as watches, charms, rings and precious metals, according to the Home Office.

This year the list is likely to include the iPad mini and Air, Kindles, and the new Xbox One and PS4 games consoles.

And it's apparent from Barclays' study that shoppers are making life for cyber criminals far too easy.

The research shows that despite online shopping becoming part of the fabric of life in the UK, there are still large numbers of consumers who have a naïve attitude to the risk of fraud with over a quarter (27 per cent) admitting that they don’t take precautionary measures to protect their finances online.

Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'We are taking the fight to cyber criminals with the newly created National Cyber Crime Unit, which is part of the National Crime Agency.

'But the public should also stay vigilant to ensure they don’t lose their hard-earned money on fakes and frauds. Following straightforward steps while shopping online will help the public to avoid cyber fraudsters.

'Shoppers can find great bargains online ahead of Christmas and this time of year provides a welcome boost to retailers. But shoppers should remember if something looks too good to be true it often is.'

Logging on: 33.6 million of us are planning to do our shopping on the web this Christmas

Alex Grant, Managing Director, Fraud Prevention at Barclays, said: ‘As the number of people shopping online is set to peak this Monday – with 33.6 million of us planning to do our shopping on the web this Christmas – cyber-criminals will have a field day if precautions aren’t taken. Our research has shown that internet shoppers will be faced with a high level of threat to their personal and financial information as they hit the online stores this Christmas.

‘That’s why we’ve teamed up with Kaspersky Lab to offer all our customers free access to their suite of products that keep financial information safe and have created a range of tools and advice working with Getsafeonline.org.

‘If everyone takes some simple steps, we can all avoid giving fraudsters a gift this Christmas.’When it comes to taking precautions online, consumers should follow the lead of older shoppers, who tend to be more cautious.

While over eight in ten (82 per cent) of over 55s take precautionary measures to protect their finances, just six in ten (62 per cent) 18-24-year-olds do the same.

Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online said: ‘I’ve been talking to people about shopping safely online for years but every Christmas, without fail, I see worrying statistics about people being scammed online. £1.5 billion is a huge amount of money. The problem is, scams are evolving and getting more sophisticated all the time, they also change as trends come and go so it’s understandable that people sometimes get caught out.’

Not only does the older generation take the necessary steps to safeguard their online purchases, nearly nine in 10 (87 per cent) say they always consider the risks of online fraud when making a purchase, compared to less than seven out of ten (68 per cent) of their younger counterparts.

David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab said: ‘Fraud is not the only thing that will be putting Brits at risk when they hit the online stores this Christmas. In 2013 more than one in three people encountered malware when searching the web. With the anticipated spike in online shopping traffic in the run up to Christmas, this statistic must act as a red flag reminder that we need to protect ourselves against the variety of cyber threats we may face.

‘The good news here is that the answer to protecting ourselves against these threats lies in common sense. There are simple tools and tricks we can all employ when shopping online to avoid risk – such as being mindful of where you log on to the Internet and keeping your personal information secure.

'It’s not dissimilar to offline safety. It might be okay to walk alone at night – but it’s risky. If we take the right precautions in the first place, for example taking well-lit routes, staying close to our friends, the risk reduces. We should adopt a similar common sense mindset when we shop online.’

Tony Neate added: ‘At Get Safe Online we make it our responsibility to try and highlight new types of fraud as much as we can to keep shoppers safe online. What consumers need to do is keep the basics in mind as a good preventative measure.

'We know that Christmas is a busy and stressful time for people so we don’t try and overwhelm people with over complicated advice. If you’ve managed to hunt down that perfect present that you’ve been traipsing round the high street for online, at a fraction of the cost, take a step back and think before you buy it. Is it too good to be true?’

Barclays has a good record for fraud protection, with its customers benefitting from its handheld pinsentry device while logging on.

Now, in a show of festive generosity, it’s ramping up the defences for its customers even further by offering the Kaspersky Internet Security Suite, Kaspersky Mobile Security Suite and Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac free of charge to all its online and mobile banking customers.
