Daniel Sturridge has provided Liverpool with a major boost in their race to claim a Champions League spot by declaring he is ready to play in his side's remaining 10 games of the season.

Sturridge, who has been hampered by injuries this season, played 83 minutes of Liverpool's 2-0 win against Burnley on Wednesday night.

And the 25-year-old, who scored his fourth Premier League goal against the Clarets, has revealed he is feeling 'really good' after playing his 10th game since returning from a troublesome thigh injury at the end of January.

Sturridge, speaking to the Liverpool Echo, said: 'I feel good, I have felt really good since I came back and I am ready to play every game.

'I don’t want to be eased in but I suppose that is what the manager wants.'

The England international heaped praise on team-mate Jordan Henderson by claiming the midfielder has 'taken it to the next level'.

He added: 'He is improving every game and he has taken on the responsibility with the captain’s armband. He has taken it to the next level.'
