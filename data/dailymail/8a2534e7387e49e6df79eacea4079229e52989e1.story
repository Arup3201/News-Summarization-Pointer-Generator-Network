A garage in an upmarket area of London has gone on the market for a staggering £100,000 - and the owner can only keep it for 14 years.

The double lock-up is located off Cheyne Gardens, Chelsea, where the price of the average home is almost £4million.

The courtyard, just a minute's walk from the Thames, is just seven feet wide meaning it can just about squeeze in a Range Rover - otherwise known as a Chelsea Tractor.

The £100,000 garage (circled) in Cheyne Gardens, Chelsea - where the average price of a home is almost £4million - has had plenty of interest

With just 14 years left on the garage's lease, which cannot be extended, the secure parking space will cost £7,142 a year, £137 a week, or £20 a day. 

Despite the cost of the garage, it has had a plenty of interest from people living nearby.

Many residents of nearby streets paid multi-million pound sums for their homes which have nowhere secure to park.

John D Wood & Co, the upmarket estate agent selling the garage, has a five-bedroom home for sale on Cheyne Row for £6.45million.

It has three bathrooms, two reception rooms, a pantry, laundry with patio, wine cellar and store rooms, gardens, separate studio - but no garage. 

The £100,000 price tag makes the lock-up as expensive as a renovated cottage in the West Country or a charming two-bed home in Cumbria. 

For £100,000 - the same price as the garage in Chelsea - you could buy this charming two-bedroom cottage in Aikton, which is just five miles from the Scottish border and comes with wooden beamed ceilings and an open fireplace

The cosy two-up two-down is perfect first step on to the housing ladder for young families and is just 15 miles from the Lake District

Robert Green, director of John D Wood & Co, said: 'The garage is located in a part of Chelsea close to the large houses of Cheyne Walk, and smart flats of Cheyne Gardens.

'Many of the owners of these houses and flats value being able to park a classic or special car away from the street and winter weather.

'Normally these garages rent for up to £8,500 per year, so the opportunity to acquire one on a lease with 14 years remaining has created good interest.

'The price offers a degree of certainty, and by paying upfront for 14 years one can forget about rent reviews.'
