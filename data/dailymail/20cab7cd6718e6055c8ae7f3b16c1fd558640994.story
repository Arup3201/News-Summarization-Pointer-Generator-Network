A drunken man who waved a slice of pizza at police officers was shot with a Taser.

Neil Griffiths, 28, was felled by the 50,000-volt stun gun after being told to come out of his house to be arrested.

‘When he came out, he was very aggressive towards police,’ said Rachel Knight, the prosecutor in the court case against Griffiths.

‘He was holding a piece of pizza at them and making threats, but the police were not concerned about it when they identified what it [the pizza] was.’

The use of the potentially fatal weapon brought to an end an evening of violence by Griffiths in his home village of Penrhys, South Wales. 

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard how it began with him arguing with two fellow customers in a kebab shop after ordering a pizza. He left with his food, only to return with a kitchen knife.

Mrs Knight yesterday told the court that Griffiths attacked one of the men, Christopher McGrath, 20, who tried to grab the knife – but it ended up against his throat.

His friend, Gavin Lloyd Clement, 18, was rugby-tackled to the floor during the fight, and Griffiths knelt over him with the knife at Mr Clement’s throat.

After Griffiths went home, armed police surrounded his property.

‘When he came out, he was very aggressive towards police,’ said Mrs Knight.

‘He was holding a piece of pizza at them and making threats but the police were not concerned about it when they identified what it was.’

He later told them he had been drunk and high on cocaine. He was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to two counts of assault and possessing an offensive weapon. He must also pay an £80 victim surcharge.

His lawyer said his client was a ‘hard-working’ man with a young son who had learned a ‘salutary lesson’. He has three previous convictions for public disorder and possessing drugs with intent to supply.

Tasers are increasingly being relied upon by British police, who now fire up to five a day.

Figures published last year showed the number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250.

There has been a huge investment in the weapons in the decade since they were introduced, and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times a year.

There are 14,700 officers trained to use the stun guns. But Police Federation chairman Steve White last week repeated calls for every frontline officer to be handed one.

Experts estimate that each officer will draw his weapon once every two years and fire them once in eight years.

Many police chiefs argue that the weapons offers a less lethal alternative to live ammunition and can help resolve some of the most challenging stand-offs.

Critics express fears about training and monitoring and claim the police are being ‘armed by stealth’.
