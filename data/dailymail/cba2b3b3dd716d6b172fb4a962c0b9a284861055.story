Despite sounding like Frankenstein’s pet, this crafty crow is all bird – even though he can bark like a dog, catch mice like a cat and natter like a parrot.

The pet crow, who does not have a name, likes catching rodents on the farm where he lives and also manages basic Chinese.

According to owner Ma Baocheng, the crow can manage simple phrases and expressions in Chinese, like saying hello, and also barks like a dog.

What a catch: Ma Baocheng's pet crow is the top bird when it comes to hunting mice in Nanning, Guangxi Province

Mr Ma, from Nanning, Guangxi Province, bought the crow a year ago to keep as a pet.

Mr Ma has said that although he is impressed by the crow’s Chinese skills and barking noise, its biggest stunt is catching mice.

‘If he spotted a mouse in the farm, he would fly down and peck the mouse.’

Watcha lookin at? The pet crow does not just catch mice, it also knows basic Chinese and barks like a dog

The crow's owner Mr Ma claims that it can speak Chinese, managing simple expressions such as saying hello

Mr Ma's neighbours thought the crow was a bad omen and made him give it to a friend

Although Ma loves his pet crow very much, his neighbours have complained and see it as a bad omen. 

A month ago, Ma had to resettle his pet crow in a friend's farm.

He said: ‘The last time I visited him, he was like a spoiled kid in the beginning, staring at me coldly.

‘But in a short time, he flew onto my shoulder and we played together like good friends.’
