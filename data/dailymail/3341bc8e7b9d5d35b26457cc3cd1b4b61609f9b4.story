The MP who first raised the alarm against Nigel Evans last night warned that Westminster was 'turning a blind eye' to sexual harassment in the corridors of power.

Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, said she had faced 'rank hostility' from colleagues whom she accused of turning on her over her decisions to report allegations against Mr Evans.

She said senior political figures have many 'questions to answer' over the culture of the Houses of Parliament, dubbed the 'Palace of Sexminster'.

The MP spoke out days after fellow Conservative Mr Evans, the former Commons deputy speaker, was cleared of eight charges of sex attacks on young men, including one of rape.

Speaking out: Sarah Wollaston said she had faced 'rank hostility' from colleagues whom she accused of turning on her over her decisions to report allegations against Nigel Evans

The case went to court after Dr Wollaston raised allegations she had heard from an alleged victim with the Commons Speaker John Bercow. Mr Evans said he had been the victim of a Machiavellian plot and said Dr Wollaston had 'decided to have it in' for him.

But last night he claimed he bore no ill will towards Dr Wollaston. '[If I met her] I'd say, "Hello Sarah, let's have a chat", and no doubt at some stage we will,' he told LBC radio.

'It's difficult for anybody to be put in the position that Sarah Wollaston was put in, and then to think, "What would you do if somebody came to you with something like that?", and so I don't blame her.'

It emerged last night that former Tory leadership contender David Davis had organised a welcome back to Parliament party for Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, to be held next week.

After Mr Evans's acquittal a survey for Channel 4 News uncovered evidence of a culture of excessive drinking between some MPs and young male researchers in Commons bars.

Writing for the Telegraph's website, Dr Wollaston said: 'This process was never going to be easy. But I have been truly shocked by the rank hostility since Mr Evans's acquittal, from those who seriously feel I should have done nothing.

How can it be acceptable for a third of the 70 researchers interviewed by Channel 4 News to have experienced sexual harassment at Westminster?

'The people who truly have questions to answer are those who have for so long turned a blind eye to the reports of such harassment. I didn't, and don't, want to be one of them.'

One of the alleged victims in the case spoke to police last May after telling Dr Wollaston what he claimed had happened.

She informed Mr Bercow, who said it was a police matter after being told another young man had accused Mr Evans of rape.

In court, Mr Evans said that the alleged rape had been consensual sex, and accused other complainants of telling 'absurd' stories as part of a co-ordinated effort to wreck his political career.

Dr Wollaston wrote: 'Following his acquittal on nine charges of rape and sexual assault, Nigel Evans – the former Deputy Speaker – has claimed that I "had it in for him".

'Others have demanded that I apologise, and reflect on my role in the case.

'To them, I ask: What would you do if, in a social setting, someone told you that they had been sexually assaulted by one of your most popular colleagues?

'Would you have laughed off the allegation, or brushed it aside? I did not.'

She revealed that since the verdict, she had spoken to the young men and 'offered to stand down as an MP if they feel that I pressured them to take the complaint forward'.

'Both are clear that I did not do so, and that I discussed with them the risks of doing so as well as their own concerns about protecting others,' she said.

And she also rejected Mr Evans' argument that rape suspects should be given anonymity. 'Few cases make it to a courtroom and fewer still result in a conviction,' she said.

'Changing the rules on anonymity would slash reporting rates even further.'  Dr Wollaston, who is a GP, said she felt she had to pass on the allegations because she was a member of the Commons health select committee which has called for doctors to be struck off if they fail to report serious allegations about colleagues.

'It would have been rank hypocrisy to demand that standard from my fellow doctors, while failing to be prepared to do so myself,' she said.
