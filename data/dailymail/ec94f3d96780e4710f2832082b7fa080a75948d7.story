The personal financial details of millions of taxpayers could be sold to private firms under Government plans that have been branded ‘borderline insane’.

HM Revenue and Customs last night confirmed it was planning a change in the law to allow the release of ‘anonymised’ data to third parties – despite warnings it could lead to a catastrophic privacy breach.

A consultation issued by the department says it is looking at ‘charging options’, but says the aim is to share data with researchers and companies in order to benefit the public.

It remains unclear exactly what data HMRC could be allowed to share in the future.

Officials insisted it would be impossible to identify the details of any individual taxpayer, preserving their confidentiality.

But critics warned it could follow the catastrophic example of the NHS’s Care.data scheme, which has been delayed after it emerged that supposedly anonymised data included key personal details like postcodes, dates of birth and NHS numbers.

Former shadow home secretary David Davis
 described the proposal as ‘borderline insane’ and said the Treasury had
 listed ‘no credible benefits’ to support the move.

The senior Tory added: ‘The officials who drew this up clearly have no idea of the risks to data in an electronic age.

Our forefathers put these checks and balances in place when the information was kept in cardboard files, and data was therefore difficult to appropriate and misuse.

‘It defies logic that we would remove those restraints at a time when data can be collected by the gigabyte, processed in milliseconds and transported around the world almost instantaneously.’

Privacy campaigners also raised the alarm. Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said the data could be ‘vulnerable to reidentification’.

Stephen Coleclough, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said HMRC did not understand the ‘worrying and dangerous’ implications of the move.

The Treasury last night confirmed it was pressing ahead with the plans, but insisted safeguards would be put in place to protect privacy.
