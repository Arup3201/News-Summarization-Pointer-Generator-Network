Ronny Deila hopes Celtic can be inspired by history when they seek to condemn Italian giants Inter Milan to a Europa League exit.

The Parkhead club were paired with Inter in yesterday's last-32 draw in Nyon, creating a rematch of the Lisbon Lions' famous victory in the 1967 European Cup final.

And Deila admits the echoes from Celtic's finest hour add another dimension to the glamour tie against Roberto Mancini's men.

'It's going to be a very good match and I'm really looking forward to it,' said the Parkhead boss. 'We are meeting a big opponent but we always have a chance.

'I know Roberto Mancini is their manager now, that they have been struggling a bit for the last year or two and aren't the team they were in 2010 when they won the Champions League.

'But they are a good team and it's going to be a tough game. Everything is possible, however, and we have everything to play for. We will have to be at our best in both games to hopefully go through.

'The history adds to the match and every training exercise and match will be to prepare us as good as possible.'

Celtic host Inter – currently mid-table in Serie A - on February 19 before the return leg in San Siro seven days later. Deila's side have lost their last two European outings, but will have Swedish striker John Guidetti eligible to play after he was sidelined during the group stage.

'It will be a positive thing to have John with us during these games,' Deila told the Celtic website.

'It's important to get everybody ready for the game, keep them injury-free and keep the squad as good as possible.'

Celtic assistant manager John Collins also enthused about the tie, adding: 'It' s a wonderful draw, an exciting draw. They are a big Italian side but they are not firing on all cylinders in their league and are beatable, particularly at home with our support.

'They are a prestigious club, with a fantastic venue and a lot of history, similar to us. It's two massive clubs with great history going up against one another.

'It's a very good draw and we will have to play well to win. It will have everyone excited - the players, coaching staff and the supporters. And that's what we want – we need excitement and challenges.

'It brings back wonderful memories, certainly among the older supporters, of a special day in the club's history. But the stories have been passed down from generation to generation. It ticks all the boxes.

'There will be a big crowd at Celtic Park and one that will excite the supporters, and the players will be motivated and fired-up for it.

'They have international-class players and it will be a big challenge. We wanted a big game and a big challenge. It's winnable but we will have to play well, which we are at the moment.'

Inter managing director Marco Farrone represented his club at the draw and is eagerly anticipating their trip to Glasgow.

'The Celtic tie has the feel of a Champions League match, due to the two sides' history,' said Farrone.

'There will be an incredible atmosphere but we're ready to face that. Playing the second leg at home is a minor advantage. It will be one of the most exciting ties of the round.

'There are five rounds between here and (the final) in Warsaw. But we need to try and win this competition for the prestige and for the chance to qualify for the Champions League.'
