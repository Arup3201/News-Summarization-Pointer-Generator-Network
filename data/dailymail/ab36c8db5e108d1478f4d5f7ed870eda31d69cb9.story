Julia Pierson has been named the first female director of the Secret Service by President Barack Obama today signalling his desire to change the culture at the male-dominated service which has been marred by scandal.

Pierson, who most recently served as the agency's chief of staff, takes over from Mark Sullivan, who announced his retirement last month following a prostitution scandal within his department last year.

Several of Sullivan's agents hired prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia during preparations for one of Obama's planned trips, firing off an avalanche of intense criticism over the agency's handling.

It also raised questions within the agency â€“ as well as at the White House and on Capitol Hill- about the culture, particularly during foreign travel. In addition to protecting the president, the Secret Service also investigates financial crimes.

'Over her 30 years of experience with the Secret Service, Julia has consistently exemplified the spirit and dedication the men and women of the service demonstrate every day,' Obama said in a statement announcing Pierson's appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation.

At the Secret Service, Pierson has served as deputy assistant director of the office of protective operations, assistant director of human resources and training and chief of staff.

She started in 1983 as a special agent in Miami. Before that, she was a police officer in Orlando, Florida.

'Julia is eminently qualified to lead the agency that not only safeguards Americans at major events and secures our financial system, but also protects our leaders and our first families, including my own,' Obama said.

'Julia has had an exemplary career, and I know these experiences will guide her as she takes on this new challenge to lead the impressive men and women of this important agency.'

Thirteen Secret Service employees were caught up in last year's prostitution scandal.

After a night of heavy partying in the Caribbean resort city of Cartagena, the employees brought women, including prostitutes, to the hotel where they were staying. The incident became public after one agent refused to pay a prostitute and the pair argued about payment in a hotel hallway.

Eight of the employees were forced out of the agency, three were cleared of serious misconduct and at least two have been fighting to get their jobs back.

The incident took place before Obama arrived in Colombia and the service said the president's safety was never compromised. But news of the scandal broke during his trip, overshadowing the summit and embarrassing the U.S. delegation.

Sullivan issued a new code of conduct that bans employees from drinking within 10 hours of starting a shift or bringing foreign nationals back to their hotel rooms.

Sullivan apologized for the incident last year during testimony before a Senate panel.

'I have known and worked with Julie for close to thirty years,' said Sullivan in a statement on Tuesday.

'She was an excellent Assistant Director and Chief of Staff, demonstrating sound judgment, leadership, character, and commitment to our Country, the men and women of the U.S. Secret Service and those we serve and protect. This is a historic and exciting time for the Secret Service and I know Julie will do an outstanding job.'
