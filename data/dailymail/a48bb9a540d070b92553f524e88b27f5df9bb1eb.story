A pensioner has died after he is believed to have been crushed to death by a tree he was cutting down.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said that controllers dispatched an ambulance and a rapid response car to the scene.

'Sadly the man was already dead by the time our crews got there,' he said.

The incident happened in a wooded area that separates the Marsh Farm and Sundon Park estates close to Leagrave Park.

The park is owned by Luton Borough Council.

A Council spokesman confirmed today that an investigation has been launched and will be referred to the Health and Safety Executive.

According to the spokesman, no issues concerning the woodland surrounding the park had been reported before the incident and the area was checked before the park was reopened to the public earlier today.
