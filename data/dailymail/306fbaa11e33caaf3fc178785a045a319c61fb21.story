A Premier League club has played the unlikely role of matchmaker to help a bashful fan meet the 'unreal looking girl' seated in front of him. 

The Southampton supporter, known only as Timothy, was too shy to speak to the pretty brunette himself so went to the club for help. 

Determined to assist the shy supporter, the club placed a red rose on his seat to help break the ice between the pair.

The Southampton supporter known as Timothy tweeted this picture after the club left flowers on his seat

After he contacted them on Twitter, the club left the flowers complete with a 'good luck' message for Timothy

A supporter took a picture of the pair together inside the St Mary's Stadium, with the girl clutching the flowers

The plucky Southampton fan began the campaign to try and get to know the girl seated in front of him

He described the fellow supporter as an 'unreal looking' girl who keeps 'giving me (the) eyes' 

Southampton FC stepped in and advised the supporter on how he should proceed to win over the girl

The fan was shocked to have received relationship advice from his football club 

He planned to approach the girl during the home match against Chelsea on December 28 but could not make the match when his car broke down

He abandoned the plan until the  match against Arsenal and got support from Saints legend Matt Le Tissier

He gave her the flowers and Bovril and tweeted a selfie of the grinning pair from inside the St Mary's stadium

Supporter Kelly Morse snapped a picture of the pair with the caption 'she got the flowers' 

The club said they were 'proud' of Tim after he gave the girl the rose and Bovil they put on his seat

Initially Timothy contacted the club's official Twitter account asking if they would him tell him the name of the girl, who sits near him at St Mary's Stadium.

But the Premier League outfit replied saying this would not be possible due to data protection laws.

Instead, staff at the south coast side - who sit in fourth place in the league table - hatched a  plan.

Southampton mascot 'Sammy Saint' did his bit for lovestruck Timothy by leaving a rose and Bovril voucher on his seat and wishing him good luck ahead of yesterday's 2-0 victory over Arsenal.

And after the game Timothy tweeted: 'Thank you to Southampton FC. She didn't like the Bovril but loved the flowers!'

The romantic tale began when the Southampton fan wrote to the club asking if they could tell him who the girl was who was 'giving him the eyes'.

He tweeted: 'Unreal looking girl that sits 4 seats next to me that keeps giving me eyes. Can you tell me who sits in Block 24 seat 626?'

Timothy gave the girl the flowers and Bovil during Southampton's match against Arsenal that they won 2-0

This prompted Southampton fan Gary Brant to step in as he urged Timothy to man up and simply speak to her.

Gary wrote: 'Why don't you just speak to her next game?'

The club replied the day after Southampton's 3-0 over Everton on December 20: 'We're with Gary. Christmas is the time to tell people how you really feel - maybe you should've done it yesterday?'

He appeared to take this advice and intended to speak to her during the Chelsea match on December 28, but his plans were dashed when his car broke down - meaning his missed the game.

Timothy wrote: 'My car broke down on the way, didn't make the game. Maybe a New Year's Day halftime shout out?' 

Spurred on with support from Saints icon Matt Le Tisser, Timothy gave her the flower and the voucher before taking a selfie of the pair at the stadium. 

After the match, the club tweeted: 'We're proud of you. Our work here is done. #WellDoneTim'
