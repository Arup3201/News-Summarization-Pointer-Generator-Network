A newly discovered species of beetle has been named in honour of TV naturalist, Sir David Attenborough.

Trigonopterus attenboroughi is the latest of a long list of animals and plants to be named after the broadcaster, including a grasshopper, a rat eating plant, and an Australian goblin spider.

The researchers hope their findings will strengthen their case for protecting the beetles' natural habitat around Java, Bali and Lombok.

It was one of 98 other new species of this particular beetle genus discovered by German scientists on Indonesia, according to the report published in the open access journal ZooKeys.

Researchers identified the new species by taking a part of the beetle's DNA to sequence.

Trigonopterus attenboroughi is reddish-brown in colour and measures up to 0.1-inch (2.63mm) in length. 

Alexander Riedel, the researcher who discovered the Trigonopterus attenboroughi, said naming the latest find after Sir David Attenborough was an easy decision.

He got the idea when he was watching Life on Earth with his daughter.

'It was surprising that in Bali even areas regularly visited by package tours can be the home of unknown species,' said Dr Riedel from the Natural History Museum in Karlsruhe, Germany.

'It was a challenge to find suitable names for so many new species.

'Some could be based on their respective localities; others were named by the Indonesian numbers one to 12; however, the easiest choice was to name one for Sir David Attenborough in recognition of his outstanding documentaries on natural history.

'It can be hoped that the documentation of nature´s beauty finally leads to an effective protection of this heritage.'

Doctor Yayuk Suhardjono, of the Indonesian Research Centre of Biology, added: 'Many of these species are restricted to small areas; sometimes they are found only in a single locality.

'These beetles are wingless and usually stay for millions of years where they are.

'This makes them extremely vulnerable to changes of their habitat.'

In 2012, a tiny species of Goblin Spider, Prethopalpus attenborough, found on an island off Australia was named after Sir David Attenborough.

Just two years earlier, Sir Attenborough was the inspiration for naming a flesh-eating pitcher plant that was able to swallow rats whole.

Sir Attenborough has previously said 'naming a species is the biggest of compliments that you could ask from any scientific community.'
