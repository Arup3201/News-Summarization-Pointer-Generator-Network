Women have deserted David Cameron’s Tories in three years because they think he is out of touch and too posh, a demining survey has found.

After securing a five-point Conservative lead among female voters at the last general election, the party has now slumped to 13 points behind Labour.

Almost half of women think Mr Cameron is the most out of touch of the main party leaders, with just a third satisfied with his leadership.

Woman trouble: David Cameron has seen his popularity with female voters evaporate, handing Labour a large lead in the polls

Switch: Labour's lead over the Tories among women now stands at 13 points, according to the Mumsnet/ Ipsos Mori poll

The Conservatives have repeatedly launched attempts to woo the female vote, hiring advisers dedicated to developing policies which appeal to women.

But the increase in Labour’s popularity since 2010 has been fuelled by women abandoning Mr Cameron in favour of Ed Miliband.

Three years ago 36 per cent of women backed the Tories, compared to 31 per cent for Labour.

But a new Ipsos Mori survey for Mumsnet shows only 29 per cent now support the Conservatives, with Labour up to 42 per cent. The gap is three times large than among male voters.

Labour has a 25 point lead among women aged 18-34 and 21 points among 35-54 year olds.

Adding to the Tory woes, Labour is even ahead among the most affluent women who might be expected to back the Tories.

Justine Roberts, chief executive of Mumsnet, said: ‘On the key issues of the economy and employment and particularly where the cuts have fallen, women feel like there is a lack of someone looking out for their interests.

‘One bit of the narrative [about Cameron] that stands up is this elitist Oxbridge-Eton man who doesn't quite get women.’

More than half of women (58 per cent) say they are satisfied with Mr Cameron’s leadership, with only 33 per cent satisfied.

And asked which leader is the most out of touch – Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband or Nick Clegg – the Tory leader came out on top at 46 per cent.

During a series of focus groups, female voters were asked what they thought about the party leaders.

Mr Cameron was described as ‘out of touch’, with mothers angry at cuts to child benefit and a lack of help for families.

‘He does bugger all for women like me,’ said Tanya, a stay-at-home mother who voted Conservative in 2010.

Thumbs down: Labour leader Ed Miliband was branded 'creepy' while Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg was described in a focus group as 'damaged goods'

Carla, who backed the Lib Dems in 2010, said of the PM: ‘Rich, privileged, public-school-educated, what has he got in common with 99% of voters?’

But there was little good news for the Labour and Lib Dem leaders.

Mr Clegg was branded a ‘snake in the grass [who] sacrificed his integrity to get a place in the leadership’. The Sunday Times reported. Another branded him ‘damaged goods in terms of integrity’.

Mr Miliband was described as ‘creepy’ and ‘faceless’, with many struggling to distinguish between him from his brother David.

Miss Roberts, the chief executive of Mumsnet, added: ‘There is no real positive feeling. If anything the messaging is that there is a real job for Miliband to do to convince women in particular that he is actually capable."
