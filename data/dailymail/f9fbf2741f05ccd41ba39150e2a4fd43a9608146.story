Wealthy foreigners will be able to buy European citizenship under controversial plans by Malta to sell passports for half a million pounds.

The policy will allow the super-rich from countries like Russia and China to effectively by the right to live and work anywhere in the EU.

The Home Office warns it will not tolerate ‘abuse’ of free movement rules across the EU and is working to prevent people using loopholes to enter the UK.

Malta, which joined the EU in 2004, will offer the citizenship and passport from next month.

Up to 300 ‘high value’ people are expected to take advantage of the scheme, each paying €650,000 (£546,000).

Opposition parties in Malta have raised concerns about the vetting process and the fact the identities of those who buy a passport will be kept secret.

Many countries have schemes speeding up the citizenship process for wealthy investors.

But Malta will give applicants a passport without requiring them to live in the country first.

The Home Office said: ‘The Government is clear that EU citizens who benefit from the right to free movement must adhere to the responsibilities this brings with it.

‘The Government does not tolerate the abuse of free movement rights and is working at a domestic level and with other member states to tackle such abuse.’

However, the UK government is facing calls to intervene to stop the scheme going ahead.

Labour’s
shadow immigration minister David Hanson told the Financial Times: 
‘This risks being a backdoor route to reside anywhere in the EU which is
not a tight or appropriate immigration policy’.

The UK offers an ‘investor visa’ to non-EU citizens with more than £1million in personal wealth to invest in Britain.

However they must spend at least 185 days in the UK each year.

There are warnings the appeal of investing in the UK will be undermined if the super-rich flock to Malta instead.

The
Malta scheme has also been the subject of controversy for countries 
outside the EU, because a Maltese citizen can travel without a visa to 
the US and 160 other countries.

The European Commission is refusing to get embroiled in the row, insisting it is a matter of ‘national competency’ how individual countries administer their visa policies.

A spokesman said: 'The EU has no legal power to intervene. It in effect only has powers that are delegated to it by the Member States, who have - and (presumably this would include the UK) want to keep - full sovereignty over to whom they grant their nationality. 

'Member States also decide the conditions of entry and stay of third country nationals who wish to invest in the country.'
