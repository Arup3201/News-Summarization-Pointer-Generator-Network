The boyfriend of a woman whose remains were found in 55-gallon plastic drum filled with concrete hidden in a storage facility has been charged with her murder.

Scott Wobbe, 37, of Westland, Michigan, is accused of killing 22-year-old Theresa DeKeyzer of Warren.

Wobbe, who's been jailed on a probation violation in Midland County, has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and dismemberment or mutilation of a body.

Police found DeKeyzer's (pictured) body at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing

He was arraigned and held without bond Tuesday morning, reports Mlive.com.

Her family appeared at Warren's 37th District Court for the hearing - her mother Marie Dekeyzer wore a t-shirt with the words 'Justice for Theresa' across the front as did other supporters. 

Police found DeKeyzer's body at a Detroit-area storage facility in September, three months after she was reported missing.

Wobbe reported that he last saw DeKeyzer on June 16 near her Warren home - he was the last person confirmed to have seen her.

DeKeyzer's family launched a campaign after she was reported missing to find her

In her home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety.

Her body was found at Travel Trailer Storage in Plymouth Township after Warren police executed a search warrant, Plymouth Township detective Charlie Rozum said

DeKeyzer was identified by her tattoos, clothing, and jewelry.

There were also crime scene photos available from a domestic assault reported the day on June 15 before her disappearance when, according to police, a drunken Wobbe assaulted her.

Wobbe reportedly dragged her out of his car by her shirt and punched her in the face.

A neighbor intervened, and he had fled by the time police arrived. 

At some point during the night, DeKeyzer apparently walked to a gas station for cigarettes. 

Wobbe told police he picked DeKeyzer up from the gas station and they went back to his house and made up, the Detroit News reported.

Wobbe told police he dropped DeKeyzer off, at her request, near Nine Mile and Van Dyke at 6 a.m. on June 16.

DeKeyzer's aunt, Kathi Olechowski told CBS Detroit: 'We knew the suspect who should've been looked at right away, and it took the police awhile to listen to us; but it looks like he's finally gonna get his due, and we're ecstatic about it,' Olechowski said.

'Why she went back to him we'll never understand, but, I mean, who else were they gonna look at? I mean, honestly…he's nothing but trouble, that guy.'

Wobbe faces life in prison if convicted on the murder charge.
