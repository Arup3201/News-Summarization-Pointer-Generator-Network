Stoke City assistant manager Mark Bowen has revealed that Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri is a surprise transfer target for the club.

Inter Milan are the firm favourites for the 23-year-old who is due to hold discussions with Bayern officials on Wednesday morning. 

'To get a good player like him on board would be fantastic,' Bowen told Radio Stoke on Tuesday.

Several clubs are chasing the signature of Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri in January 

'There are other clubs interested, but it doesn't mean we rule ourselves out. He's definitely on the list, but there is competition for a player of his ability.'

Bowen believes Bojan's move to the club from Barcelona helps.

'It's bound to help and it does help,' he said. 'There's many boxes to tick, not least the financial side of it, and with Shaqiri coming from one of the best clubs in the world, there's a lot of persuasion to get it done.'

Shaqiri has also been linked with Liverpool with the midfielder said to be well liked by Brendan Rodgers.  

Stoke pulled off a major coup in the summer when they secured Bojan Krkic (right) from Barcelona 

The Reds, however, are reluctant to spend now and would prefer to look at a deal in the summer instead.

Inter have offered £2million for a loan deal, similar to the one proposed to Arsenal for Lukas Podolski, but Bayern want to sell outright and would like Liverpool to come to the table. 

Erdin, Xherdan's agent, wants to see if Bayern will accept a loan deal to Inter now with the prospect of joining Liverpool in the summer.

Bayern are still on their winter break but the player's immediate future should come to a conclusion after Wednesday's meeting.
