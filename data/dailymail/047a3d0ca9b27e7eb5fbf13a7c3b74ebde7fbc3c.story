The DNA combination says it is a billion in one match of Stephen Farrow and Betty Yates

A mixture of a retired teacher's DNA and that of the man accused of her murder has a one-in-a-billion match after it was found on the back of her hand, a court heard today.

A 'full DNA profile' of drifter Stephen Farrow, 48, was found on a swab taken from Betty Yates’ left hand following the discovery of her body.

The 77-year-old was found stabbed to death in her cottage, in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on January 4, having been killed two days earlier.

Farrow, of no fixed address, claims he saw Mrs Yates on December 30 but Bristol Crown Court heard the location the DNA sample was found would make it 'extremely rare' to get such a strong profile days later.

Forensic Scientist Christopher McKenzie told the jury: 'The DNA profile obtained showed a mixture of DNA from two people which matched the corresponding DNA profiles of Mrs Yates and Stephen Farrow.

'We found that it is a billion times more likely to have come from Betty Yates and Stephen Farrow than from Betty Yates and someone other than Stephen Farrow.'

Mr McKenzie said he would expect the DNA to only stay on the hands for a relatively short period of time.

'Typically washing is the best way of removing it, or contact with other surfaces,' he said.

'You would expect the hands to be regularly washed and in contact with other items.'

Mr McKenzie said given the strength of the DNA profile he would expect there to have been either direct physical contact between Mrs Yates and Farrow or for it to have come from a bodily fluid - potentially saliva or sweat.

Farrow, who has a personality disorder, denies murdering Betty Yates, right, but admits the manslaughter of Rev John Suddrds on the grounds of diminished responsibility

He added it was 'extremely rare' to find a DNA profile in such a strong level in active life after just 12 hours.

When questioned by Farrow’s barrister Peter Gower QC about the possibility of 'secondary transfer' - meaning that Farrow may have touch a surface and Mrs Yates picked up the DNA from that surface - Mr McKenzie said it is 'very rare' to detect DNA in the levels they have found from secondary transfer.

The court heard a number of swabs were taken from Mrs Yates but the sample from the back of her left hand gave the strongest profile.

Farrow, who was not present to hear the evidence having declined to come to court, denies the murder of Mrs Yates.

Accused Farrow has pleaded guilty to burgling another property, where a note was found threatening to kill 'Christian scum'

He is also standing trial for the murder of Rev John Suddards, found stabbed to death at his home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on February 14.

Farrow admits the manslaughter of Mr Suddards on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder.

He has pleaded guilty to burgling another property, Vine Cottage, also in Thornbury, over the Christmas and New Year period, where a note was found threatening to kill 'Christian scum'.

The jury heard yesterday that investigators examined Mrs Yates’s home for two weeks following the discovery of her body.

Mr McKenzie, who has worked as a forensic scientist since 1998, attended the scene on January 5.

He said Mrs Yates was laid at the 
bottom of the stairs dressed in a woollen jumper, black tracksuit 
bottoms and with socks and clogs on her feet.

He agreed that her head was laid on a 
cushion from her sofa, with the knife sticking out of her neck and that 
arms were in a raised position and her legs slightly twisted.

'I looked closely at the location of the knife and how it was in her body,' Mr McKenzie said.

'When you looked closely at the jumper it was folded. The knife had passed through three layers, so as it was folded it went through one layer, then another fold, then the collar and into her neck.'

He said that after the body had been removed they did not find any blood under the cushion her head had been laid on.

'It was as I would expect if she had been hit and stabbed in the position in which she was found,' he said.

The jury were shown a long walking stick and a two inch long splinter that had broken off the stick.

Mr McKenzie said blood found on the walking stick matched that of Mrs Yates.

Farrow was arrested in Folkestone, Kent in February after Avon and Somerset Police launched a nationwide manhunt after Mr Suddards’s body was discovered.

Farrow has a severe personality disorder, which the prosecution accepts.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
