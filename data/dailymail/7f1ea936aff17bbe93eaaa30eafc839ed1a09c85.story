A Waitrose magazine showcasing the food of Israel has been hammered online for ignoring what activists regard to be the 'illegal occupation of Palestine'.

The supermarket chain's monthly food magazine 'Waitrose Kitchen' contained a 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel.

But the glossy advert, sponsored by Israel's Government Tourist Board, has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an 'apartheid regime'.

The Waitrose magazine features a glossy pull-out featuring recipe ideas and an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes

Others have posted harrowing images taken during last year's Gaza conflict.

The travel and food pull-out, in the February edition, contains an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes as well as a guide of its 'Top 10 restaurants'.

It also includes 'market tours' interviews with top Israeli chefs and an article explaining 'Why Israeli wine is winning awards, plus five wines to taste.'

Recipes in the insert include shakshuka, white fish on vegetable ragu, endive salad, and 'instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus'.

Backlash: The advert sparked anger online with some saying it ignored what campaigners described as an 'apartheid' 

Outrage: Some threatened to boycott the supermarket chain after learning of the contents of the magazine

Anger: One Twitter user accused Waitrose and the Israel Tourist Office of 'pushing Israeli propaganda'

Criticism: Others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation

The Palestine Solidarity Campaign called the insert 'disgraceful' adding: 'The booklet is a prime example of Israeli government propaganda, highlighting its efforts to distract the public abroad from its brutal military occupation of Palestinian land by replacing the image of an apartheid regime with that of a tourist-friendly, culture-loving country.'

Activisits took to Twitter with some vowing to boycott Waitrose - and encouraging others to follow suit.

One user, Rory Evans, wrote: Nothing like the taste of falafel with a side-order of apartheid, is there @waitrose #tasteofisrael.'

Another Twitter user, 'Paul in Brighton' said: 'Waitrose and Israel Tourist Office are pushing Israeli propaganda 'Taste of Israel' using @waitrose #tasteofIsrael.' 

One said that the magazine 'erases Palestinian history and culture' while others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation.

However, some hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking.'

A number of users posted pictures of the advert along with messages demanding an apology from Waitrose

Ilir Dema wrote: 'Perhaps @waitrose genuinely wants to promote cooking, why is that propaganda?'

According to BT.com, Waitrose have included a disclaimer in the magazine saying that 'every care is taken in compiling the contents of the magazine but the publishers assume no responsibility in the effect arising therefrom.

'The recipes here have been provided by the Israel Government Tourist Office and have not been tested by Waitrose or Waitrose Kitchen.'

The Independent quotes William Sitwell, Editor of Waitrose Kitchen magazine, as saying: 'Waitrose Kitchen is not political - we take adverts from a wide range of different businesses and organisations.'

A Waitrose spokesman told BT.com that the magazine containing the Taste of Israel booklet was no longer available in shops.
