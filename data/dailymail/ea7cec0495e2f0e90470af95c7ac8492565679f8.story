A self-published author was 'astounded' to discover her crime thrillers have sold a million copies after agents rejected her first efforts.

Sheila Rodgers's first novel Only The Innocent, written under the pen name Rachel Abbott, and its two sequels, have together sold a million copies - but the 62-year-old had thought she would be 'lucky' to sell 1,000.

The three e-books have been bestsellers on Amazon's Kindle store - and remain in the top 100.

Sheila Rodgers self-published published her first novel, under the pen name Rachel Abbott, in 2011

'Nobody is more astounded than me,' she told The Sunday Times.

Ms Rodgers self-published Only The Innocent in 2011 - which were soon followed by The Black Road and Sleep Tight. Her latest self-published psychological thriller - Stranger Child - is out later this month. 

All four novels feature protagonist Detective Chief Inspector Tom Douglas and focus on relationships and crime. 

'Unlike the stereotype policeman, he's not a drunkard.

'He is divorced, but he's not bitter and twisted.' 

The author, who lives on Alderney with her husband, says on her website: 'For many years it was my ambition to write a book. 

'I wasn’t particularly bothered about publishing it – I just wanted to write it.'

She adds: 'But then – when it’s finished – what do you do with it? I was under pressure from my various readers to get it published, but I didn’t really have much heart for chasing agents and all that went with it.  

'I decided that as it’s just sitting on my computer, I may as well publish it for the Kindle. Easy, I thought!'

For frustrated authors rejected by publishers or wanting to cut out the middle man, self-publishing has never been easier.

It has been revolutionized in recent years by a host of free self-publishing platforms from Amazon, Apple and specialists like Smashwords.

These have created new opportunities and a huge market for both unknown hopefuls and a few established writers.

As well as Ms Rodgers, success stories include E. L. James - whose Fifty Shades of Grey series was first self-published.

It was then picked up by Random House and became the fastest-selling paperback of all time, propelling James to the top of the Forbes list of highest-earning authors in 2013.

A big-screen adaptation starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson is hitting cinemas this month.

Mark Coker, who founded Smashwords after having his own co-authored novel rejected by publishers, wrote in a recent blog post: 'The stigma that once haunted self-published authors is quickly melting away.'
