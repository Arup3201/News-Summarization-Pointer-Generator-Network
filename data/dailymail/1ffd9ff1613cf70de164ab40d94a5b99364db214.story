Three Barclays Premier League managers are facing up to a terrible Tuesday with showdown talks planned over their futures, while another could also lose his job.

Sam Allardyce, Tim Sherwood and Neil Adams know their jobs are on the line when they meet their bosses, while Gus Poyet's future is in serious doubt.

Sportsmail revealed last week the West Ham board have decided to call time on Allardyce's reign.

On his way: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will have his fate sealed during showdown talks with the club

For the chop: Allardyce and Tim Sherwood (second left) are both expected to get the sack

The manager will be informed of co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold's decision at an end-of-season meeting.

The club have been under pressure from fans to sack Allardyce despite the 59-year-old steering the club clear of relegation.

They are unhappy with their team's style of play and the unrest has not gone unnoticed within the corridors of power at Upton Park. Work has already  begun on identifying Allardyce's replacement.

On the brink: Tottenham manager Sherwood is set to be sacked in a meeting on Tuesday

Sherwood is due to meet Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, when he is expected to be relieved of his managerial duties.

Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino is Levy's first choice to replace Sherwood, 45, while the White Hart Lane club are also interested in Ajax boss Frank de Boer.

Sherwood could be offered an immediate return to management by Championship club Brighton. They are keen for him to replace Oscar Garcia, who left the club after Sunday's play-off semi-final defeat by Derby.

Garcia, meanwhile, has emerged as a contender for the manager's post at West Bromwich Albion following the departure of Pepe Mel.

Sunderland owner Ellis Short and chief executive Margaret Byrne have started planning for life without Poyet.

Sportsmail revealed last week how Poyet's future was uncertain despite leading them to safety. He wants greater control over the club's transfer dealings but it is understood the club have reservations after the manager's January signings made little impact. Sunderland are already exploring their options should Poyet leave.

Relegation: Neil Adams took charge of Norwich for the final five games but couldn't avoid the drop

The former Chelsea midfielder will not be short of job offers. Sportsmail understands he has already turned down a move to Spanish club Celta Vigo while Southampton and West Ham could also be interested.

Norwich boss Adams, who replaced Chris Hughton with five games left but failed to save the club from relegation, is expected to learn his fate from chief executive David McNally. Malky Mackay is a contender to replace him at Carrow Road.
