An historic London house inhabited by squatters was completely trashed last night after violence erupted at a 'closing party' advertised on Facebook.

Police were forced to step in this morning after hundreds of people descended on the squat in Brixton, south London, following a council announcement that inhabitants of the property would be evicted today.

There were reports of muggings and vandalism at the party at Clifton Mansions, a block of 22 council-owned flats on Coldharbour Lane.

Hundreds of revellers last night turned up to a party at Clifton Mansions on Coldharbour Lane, which was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents

The flats once housed alternative musicians and artists, such as members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller.

The council notified residents of the building, which has been squatted for over a decade, of this morning's eviction several weeks ago, claiming they were cracking down on 'anti-social behaviour'.

In anticipation of the eviction, residents held an 'eviction party', with more than 1,000 people signing up for the event on Facebook.

Twitter user 'smileandsubvert' tweeted: 'Brixton's longest squats turned into teenage Facebook party, vandalism, theft and finally eviction this morning.'

In other tweets he said: '2 Polish 
guys who lived there got pinned down & had their bikes and laptops 
stolen' and '2 guys pulled all the copper piping off the walls.'

Police also said they were notified of a robbery at the address at 3.50am.

A 17-year-old boy from Beckenham had his mobile phone stolen by two suspects.

'BrixtonBuzz' tweeted party-goers who heard about the event via Facebook had 'trashed what should have been a celebration of an old Brixton squat'.

The party was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents.

A police spokesman said: 'The pre-planned eviction of Clifton Mansions went ahead with minimal pockets of resistance and the premises have now been vacated and handed back over to the Local Authority.

'During this incident a police officer received an injury to his eye and has been taken to a south London hospital. A 35 year-old man had been arrested for assault on police.'

The council now plans to sell off the property, and will be employing 'live-in guardians' to safeguard the property until a buyer is found.
