Alex Rodriguez's tattered reputation is in for another battering after a new book reveals lewd details of his alleged penchant for three-way sexual trysts with prostitutes.

The book 'House Of Outrageous Fortune: Fifteen Central Park West, The World's Most Powerful Address,' by Michael Gross, claims the Yankee slugger frequently hired escorts and often in pairs.

The alleged trysts occurred when A-Rod was paying $30,000-a-month to rent an apartment at an exclusive Upper East Side building in 2010.

New scandal: Alex Rodriguez's tattered reputation is in for another battering after a new book reveals lewd details of his alleged penchant for three-way sexual trysts with prostitutes

Claims appear in the book 'House Of Outrageous Fortune: Fifteen Central Park West, The World's Most Powerful Address' by Michael Gross

He shared the star-studded limestone tower with Sting, Denzel Washington and Bob Costas, plus a few of Wall Street's biggest names.

A-Rod's spokesman, Ron Berkowitz, told The Post the allegations concerning prostitutes were 'categorically false.'

'This is a further effort to fabricate scandal around Alex,' he said.

But according to The New York Post, a building worker told Gross the sports star 'got hookers all the time,' even when he was still seeing Cameron Diaz.

'Usually two at a time, two times a week. One time he had two go up, they came down and left, and 10 minutes later, Cameron Diaz walks in,' he recalled to the author.

'Fifteen [Central Park West] became A-Rod's home plate,' Gross writes, according to The Post.

There,
the Yankee who is worth some $275 million scored Madonna and Kate 
Hudson, as well as Diaz. But the hooker's allegedly kept coming.

A broker called Rodriguez 'the best tenant' in the book, but the staff at 15 Central Park West didn't feel the same.

'He was a douche, an unfriendly narcissist,' another building worker told Gross, according to The Post. 'I hate the guy. He thought he was God.'

The book will be published March 11, 2014, by Atria/Simon & Schuster.
