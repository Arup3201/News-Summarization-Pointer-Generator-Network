A two-mile, £600million tunnel must be built under Stonehenge to end decades of congestion on one of the country's busiest roads, business leaders have warned.

John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said reducing congestion on the busy A303 was 'vital', despite the difficulty of bypassing the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire. 

He said the landmark could not be moved, so traffic should be diverted under it and urged Chancellor George Osborne to give the go-ahead to the project in next month's Autumn Statement.

Business groups are urging the Chancellor to act to ensure the slowdown is no more than that and that the economy continues to grow at a steady pace. Top of the wish-list is investment in infrastructure.

The EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, complains that Britain’s road network is ‘crumbling’ while the British Chambers of Commerce says business is ‘dismayed’ by the lack of action on infrastructure.

Mr Cridland said both he and business want to see ‘diggers on the ground’ – and his top priority is a tunnel under Stonehenge to ease traffic on the A303.

He added: ‘Look at the main links that are really important to the country in terms of growth. The link between London and the South West is under invested in.’

Plans to build a tunnel under Stonehenge were dropped seven years ago on cost grounds but ministers and civil servants are again looking at the idea. 

An announcement about upgrading the whole A303 - which runs from Honiton in Devon to Basingstoke, Hampshire - is expected in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement next month.

A new visitor centre has been built at Stonehenge and an adjacent road closed, but the area remains blighted by massive traffic jams.

Mr Cridland says it is ‘the right thing to do for the country’. ‘We should just get on with it. It’s the only solution,’ he insists.

'The most significant barrier is Stonehenge. You obviously can't move it, so why not go under it?' he said.

Mr Cridland said investment in infrastructure was one of a series of measures business wanted from the Chancellor.

Security of energy supplies was also crucial for industry, while moves to boost business investment, such as extending tax credits for research and development, should also be included in the Autumn Statement, said Mr Cridland.

He also backed the free movement of labour in Europe, saying that overseas workers were needed to plug skills shortages.

Business wanted to remain in a reformed European Union, said Mr Cridland, adding it was disappointing that so much coverage of the EU was negative.

He called for more British students to spend part of their course in another area of the EU to promote better links between countries.

Mr Cridland said he was optimistic about the British economy, forecasting growth of 3 per cent this year, but expressed concerns about 'headwinds' from the eurozone.
