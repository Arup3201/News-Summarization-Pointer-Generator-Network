Winter mornings spent shivering and scraping the ice from your windscreen could soon go out of the window.

Scientists have developed a coating for glass which keeps it clear – no matter what Mother Nature throws at it.

Created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it repels rain but absorbs moisture from the environment rather than allowing it to gather as condensation.

The team tested coatings by chilling glass to -20C, then leaving them at room temperature. The new coating (right) remained frost free and outperformed current anti-frost coatings (left) and untreated glass (middle)

The coating is a 'zwitter-wettable surface' 
which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain.

This
means that, in effect, rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in
the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation 
on the surface.

Engineers Michael Rubner and Robert 
Cohen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: ‘It resists 
both fogging and frosting which could have uses ranging from automobile 
windshields to camera lenses.’

Its
application could also work for spectacles or any kind of glass that is
susceptible to getting steamed up in certain conditions, they said.

Currently
the best water-repellent coatings are good for 
maintaining visibility through the windscreen in the driving rain.

But
they do not prevent the glass from getting misty because of the 
condensation that builds up in wet weather, the researchers said.

However,
the latest version developed is called a 'zwitter-wettable surface' 
which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain.

This
means that, in effect, rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in
the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation 
on the surface.

Zwitter, Rubner said, is a German word for hybrid, used in a number of chemistry terms to describe something that carries two opposite properties at once.

In this case, it describes a surface 
that has the ability to behave as both hydrophobic (to water droplets) 
and hydrophilic (to gas-phase water molecules).

The surface is made by a process 
called layer-by-layer deposition. In this case, alternating layers of 
two different polymers — poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(acrylic acid) — 
are deposited on a glass surface.

'The magic of what we do is nanoscale 
processing,' Rubner explains: producing the layers so as to control 
their properties almost down to the level of individual molecules.

This production process appears relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out on large scales.

'These are common polymers,' Rubner says. 'They’re well-known and cheap, but brought together in a unique way.'

To test the effectiveness of this material, and that of many other alternatives, the team devised a set of extreme tests.

For example, they kept samples of the 
material at minus 20 degrees Celsius for an hour, then exposed them to a
very humid environment.

Development: Scraping frost from your car windscreen on cold mornings may become a thing of the past

While untreated glass, or glass 
treated with conventional hydrophilic or hydrophobic coatings, quickly 
develop a layer of frost following such treatment, glass with the new 
treatment remains clear.

However, it still appears to be hydrophobic in the presence of large water droplets.

They believe it could be used in 
everything from the inside of car windshields and ski goggles to the inside of 
supermarket refrigerator cases and double glazing.

Joseph Schlenoff, a professor of 
polymer science at Florida State University who was not involved in this
work, says, 'Everyone knows how inconvenient, or even dangerous, it is 
to have a cold window or lens fog up when water condenses on it.

'The MIT
group has devised a practical and effective method of combatting the 
fogging problem using a new ultrathin polymer film.'
