A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland is taking legal action against the Government under the Human Rights Act.

Cait Reilly, who studied geology at university, had been unable to find a job in her subject area and was claiming unemployment benefit while volunteering in a museum in the hope it would lead to a job in that sector.

But the 22-year-old had to give up the placement in order to work in the budget store under a Government scheme designed to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work.

Work experience: Cait Reilly said she had to sweep up and fill the shelves at the Poundland store in Kings Heath, Birmingham

Miss Reilly is now taking landmark 
legal action against the Government after being told she risked losing 
her £53.45-a-week Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) payment if she turned down
 the two-week unpaid work experience stint at Poundland.

Lawyers for the graduate are seeking a
 judicial review into Department for Work and Pensions rules that compel
 unemployed people to take unpaid work.

They say the scheme, part of the 
Coalition’s Work Programme to break the cycle of benefit dependency, 
amounts to ‘forced labour’ and is against the Human Rights Act.

The Government programme aims to help 
around 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and
 unpaid work experience in the public, private and charity sectors. 
Placement providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and
 Asda.

But Miss Reilly said: ‘I was actually 
doing something that was helping me work towards a job and was taken 
away from that to do something of no value to me. It was very 
frustrating.’

The graduate was sucked into the 
scheme after attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in the autumn at the 
suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser, who said it would lead to a 
period of training and a job interview.

Miss Reilly and other candidates were 
sent to an employment skills training workshop for a week, aimed at 
improving attributes such as communication skills, followed by the 
five-hour-a-day stint at Poundland near Miss Reilly’s home in King’s 
Heath, Birmingham, in November.

She and five other claimants spent 
their time on the placement sweeping up and stacking and cleaning 
shelves, before they had to attend a final week of training under the 
‘sector-based work academy’ scheme (SBWA). The promised job interview 
never materialised.

The SBWA scheme is supposed to offer the young unemployed a direct route off benefits and into work.

Graduate: Miss Reilly has been looking for work since she left Birmingham University (pictured) and had been volunteering on an unpaid basis

Miss Reilly graduated from Birmingham 
University in 2010 and has been claiming unemployment benefit since 
August.

She has now returned to her voluntary role at the city’s Pen 
Room Museum of writing and pen trade memorabilia, still looking for paid
 employment.

She believes the placement allowed Poundland to use her as ‘free labour’ in the run-up  to Christmas.

The DWP says that candidates who 
‘express an interest’ in doing unpaid placements will lose  their JSA if
 they pull out after the first ‘cooling off’ week on the scheme. But 
Miss Reilly says she was not informed about any cooling off period.

In order to meet the criteria to 
receive the Jobseeker's Allowance benefit, claimants are required to 
participate in Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme.

The scheme offers work placements 
with companies, working in conjunction with the government, designed to 
give claimants practical work experience to improve their chances of 
employment.

If claimants refuse to take part in the work placements they risk losing their benefits.

She said she felt she had to do it because ‘without my Jobseeker’s Allowance, I would literally have nothing’.

Miss Reilly’s solicitor, Jim Duffy, 
said the practice contravenes article 4 (2) of the Human Rights Act, 
which states: ‘No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory 
labour.’

Mr Duffy, from Public Interest Lawyers
 in Birmingham, said: ‘This Government has created – without 
Parliamentary authority – a complex array of schemes that allow 
Jobcentres to force people into futile, unpaid labour for weeks or 
months at a time.

‘We have no problem with Government 
schemes that increase the chances of people gaining employment – that is
 key to combating the current economic crisis – but these “work for 
benefit schemes” have been proven in other countries to do nothing other
 than increase the cycle of unemployment and poverty.

‘Cait wasn’t told when she went to the
 open day that she was committing herself to work for free. She has been
 taken away from a voluntary role useful to help her break into the 
career she would like to have, simply to stack shelves.’

Latest figures show there are now more
 than one million young people not in employment, education or training –
 so-called Neets. Employment minister Chris Grayling said: ‘We think 
it’s really important to provide young people with the opportunity to 
get into workplaces and show what they can do.

‘It’s a nonsense to suggest we should 
just be leaving them on benefits without making a real effort to find 
work. Retail offers really good career opportunities for many young 
people.’

Poundland said it had a ‘positive 
experience’ of the work placement programme which was ‘designed to 
provide on-the-job training for those looking to retail as a  career 
opportunity’.

A furniture store has received more 
than 1,300 applications for just 16 jobs at its new branch - just under 
87 candidates for each post at the DFS sofa centre in Llandudno, Wales.

The company said it had been 
'inundated' with 1,385 applications for the 16 advertised positions at 
the new store, which opens on February 18.

Greg Robbins, Llandudno's Mayor, 
welcomed the store and called for other companies to invest in the 
resort, adding: 'It’s a very positive
 thing for the town that a national company is coming here.

'I don’t know if desperation is the 
word. It shows there’s a massive shortage of long-term employment jobs 
and that we need further inward investment.'

He added that he expected vacancies 
at the proposed Travelodge in Llandudno to be similarly oversubscribed. 
It is expected to create 60 permanent jobs when it opens an 83-bed 
hotel.

Latest figures from the Office for 
National Statistics show that 9.1 per cent of Wales’ workforce were 
unemployed in the period of August to October 2011 - up from 8.4 per 
cent between May and July last year.

DFS area sales manager Adam Hankinson
 said: 'I have been amazed by both the number of applications we’ve 
received but also the high quality of the candidates.

'We’ve recruited a great bunch of 
people and I’m really excited about creating a new local team who will 
open the store within weeks.'
