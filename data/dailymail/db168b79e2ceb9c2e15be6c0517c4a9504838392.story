Nestlé has won a trademark battle against Cadbury over the shape of KitKats.

The world’s biggest food company, has succeeded in stopping rivals from copying the shape of the four-fingered bar after a seven-year legal battle.

Nestlé, the Swiss giant registered the shape of a KitKat as a trademark in 2006 - but Cadbury fought back by appealing against the application.

KitKat win: Nestlé, the world's biggest food company, has succeeded in stopping rivals from copying the shape of the four-fingered bar after a seven-year legal battle

However the latest ruling by the Board of Appeal at the EU’s Community Trade Mark Office will now prevent rival companies from producing similar bars of chocolate.

Regulators said the four-fingered shape, which was created in 1935, is now exclusively associated with Nestlé.

Marisa Broughton, trademark attorney at intellectual property law firm Withers & Rogers, said today: ‘It is possible to register shapes as trade marks under certain circumstances and in the mind of the consumer, the four-fingered shape of the KitKat chocolate bar has become synonymous with the Nestle’s product. This is a significant win for Nestle.’

Legal battle: Last year, Cadbury secured trademark rights to the purple colour used on its packaging

Nestlé’s triumph follows a history of legal battles between the two companies. Last year, Cadbury secured trademark rights to the purple colour used on its packaging.

The Intellectual Property Office said rights to the particular shade of purple - pantone 2685c - would apply to chocolate bars and drinking chocolate.

However, it said it was not yet satisfied that the colour had acquired a distinctive association for Cadbury on ‘chocolate confectionery’ and ‘chocolate assortments’.
