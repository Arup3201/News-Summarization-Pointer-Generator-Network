After her daughter was the victim of a school hate campaign, Hayley Harker refused to let the bullies win.

She promised Paige, 16, the prom of her dreams if she finished school despite the torment.

And thanks to a £1,000 splurge – and the same horse-drawn carriage used by Katie Price on her wedding day – Mrs Harker has delivered on that promise.

Devoted: Hayley Harker splashed out £1,000 to make her daughter's prom night perfect, after Paige endured years of bullying at school where she was verbally abused, kicked and tripped up

Cinderella moment: Ms Harker even hired the £600 horse-drawn carriage used by Katie Price on the day she married Peter Andre to take Paige to the prom - pulled by two horses

The mother-of-two, from Telford, 
Shropshire, splashed out £600 on hiring the carriage, drawn by two grey 
horses, as well as £240 for a custom-made dress from China.

Mrs Harker said the prom ‘marked the end of five years of hell’ for her daughter.

‘She was almost not going to go to 
college because of the bullies. She was prepared to sacrifice her 
career. But now she has had her perfect prom and closed that door .’

Shoes and jewellery to complement 
Paige’s royal blue dress set her back a further £100 – as well as £45 
for eyelash extensions and £25 for a spray tan.

The horses that took her to the event
at the Telford Whitehouse Hotel, in Wellington, were even decked out in
plumes that matched the dress.

'Sleepless nights': Ms Harker, seen with her daughter at their home in Telford, said the promise of a special prom night helped to give her daughter the strength to remain in school

Celebration: Paige wore a custom-made royal blue gown to her prom, which her mother said marked the end of 'five years of hell' for her daughter

Paige, who is ‘relieved’ to be 
leaving school and looking forward to starting beauty college in 
September, said: ‘When we drove through town, everyone’s heads were 
turning. It was like being a celebrity.

‘I had the best time and I am so grateful that my mum paid so much for my prom. It was the night that I dreamed of.’

The bullying started when Paige was 
11 and had a row with a classmate over online messaging site MSN 
Messenger. Soon she was the victim of vicious rumours.

The bullying then escalated and she 
was verbally abused, tripped up and kicked on a daily basis. It became 
so bad Paige was forced to miss a month of school and her mother had to 
pay £2,000 for a maths tutor as she fell behind.

Paige said: ‘I hated school, it was a
constant struggle. I was called names and people even tried to push me 
down a flight of stairs. It was horrible.’

Mrs Harker, a hairdresser, said: ‘She
had such a awful time at school but I didn’t want her to drop out, so I
decided to try and convince her to stay with the promise of an amazing 
prom.

‘It was all worth it to see  her dressed up and happy. I was welling up.’

'I had sleepless nights on the run up to the prom - I was so worried about everything running smoothly,' Ms Harker said.

'I just wanted Paige
to have what she wanted, she deserved it and I had promised her all 
year she could have an amazing prom - no expense spared,' she said.

Paige's ordeal began when she first 
started secondary school, and turned into a five year campaign of 
bullying that saw her verbally abused, tripped up and kicked on a daily 
basis.

Total: £1,035

Ms Harker said: 'She had such a awful time at school, she really hated going, but
I didn’t want her to drop out, so I decided to try and convince her to 
stay with the promise of an amazing prom.

'I had the dress made for her six months before, as an incentive for Paige to stay in school.'

Paige
said: 'We spent ages choosing the right material, and once we found it 
we sent off a sample to a company in China, where they used my 
measurements to make me an original dress, which no-one else would have.
It was a perfect fit.'

The strapless blue dress had eight hoops sewn into the lining of the skirt to give it extra impact.

'It was amazing, but so heavy. I was exhausted by the end of the night. Most other people had straight up and down dresses but mine was really big, and really stood out - I loved it,' the teenager said.

'The night I dreamed of': Paige, 16, says she is 'so grateful' to her mother for helping to make her night special

'No expense spared': Single mother Ms Harker, from Telford, said she had promised her daughter the 'amazing' prom night she deserved and even organised for her blue dress to be hand-made in China

'They even managed to match the feathers on the horses’ heads, which pulled my carriage, to the same royal blue as my dress, it was perfect.

'The carriages were different prices for black and white, but I had the exact same one as Katie Price had, the company bought it two days after her wedding. It was expensive but I knew it would be amazing.

'The carriage arrived early and all the neighbours came out to have a look and take pictures. When we drove through town, everyone’s heads were turning. It was like being a celebrity.

'On the day, the carriage arrived early and when I went outside all the neighbours had come out of their houses and gathered around to look and kids were asking for photos,' said Paige.

Dream come true: Paige was whisked to her prom in the same horse-drawn carriage Katie Price travelled in on the day she married Peter Andre

Ms Harker has another daughter, four-year-old Miley, who also had a new outfit for her sister’s prom and rode in the carriage with Paige on the 30-minute journey through the town.

Paige said: 'Miley will want just as big a prom as me, although she is a bit of a tomboy so probably won’t have the carriage.

'Me and my mum are very close, I tell her everything, we are the best of friends. She has really helped to fight my corner.'

Ms Harker said the bullying became so bad at one stage her daughter missed a month of school.

'Paige’s face flared up with stress acne and she didn’t want anyone to see her,' she said.

'Worth it': Ms Harker, left with her daughter Paige, said she was 'welling up' as she watched her daughter leave for her prom in all her finery
