Arsene Wenger believes that the addition of Alexis Sanchez has helped to fill his squad with belief ahead of a Premier League title charge.

The Arsenal boss oversaw a 3-0 win at Wembley against Premier League champions Manchester City in the Community Shield and felt his players are now 'united' after having problems with departing players in the past.

The Gunners lost a series of big names with Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri and Cesc Fabregas all departing for rivals at home and abroad in recent years but they have recently hung onto their star players while adding to the squad.

And Wenger believes that is making a big difference to the spirit of his players - with the likes of Aaron Ramsey praising the positive atmosphere in the dressing room. 

'It was a united team performance,' Wenger said of the Wembley win. 'We stopped physically in the second half which was expected but it was a first half of quality, togetherness and good movement.

'In the last two years we’ve added (Mesut) Ozil and Sanchez and every year before that we lost big transfers -so that of course strengthens the squad.'

And Wenger praised Sanchez's immediate impact in the Community Shield despite not enjoying a full pre season with his new team mates.

'He's not completely ready but in the first half he was lively it is very promising for the future.

'It will be an interesting season. People who watch the Premier League should be excited because there are so many strong teams in the league.'

And Mikel Arteta also believes that Sanchez's addition is making an immediate difference.

'We've got pace up front now and it makes a big difference so we're really happy to get another trophy,' he said.
