In the hotseat: England manager Roy Hodgson (left) talks to the media on Wednesday

Back in action: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) returns from a knee injury

One to watch: Edinson Cavani

With all the talk being about Suarez’s return to the side, not so much thought has focused on the presence of £55million striker who will partner the Liverpool forward. Cavani was far from his best against Costa Rica but will be desperate to prove he can perform on the big stage and with Suarez will provide a handful for England’s back four.

Key clash: Luis Suarez vs Gary Cahill

Suarez had very little joy against Cahill’s Chelsea this season – ending up on the losing side twice and failing to score against the England centre back. Uruguay have rushed their talismanic striker back into the side but he still lacks full fitness and Cahill will hope that will make his task a little easier against the Premier League’s top scorer.

Head-to-head record: Played 10, Uruguay wins 4, Draws 3, England wins 3

Key man: Gary Cahill has kept Suarez quiet in the past playing for Chelsea
