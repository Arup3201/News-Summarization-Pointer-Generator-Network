A boy was taken to an Atlanta hospital Tuesday night after being struck in the head with a foul bowl during a baseball game at Turner Field.

Milwaukee Brewers leadoff hitter Carlos Gomez lined a pitch in the seventh inning into the stands along the first-base line behind the Atlanta Braves dugout. Pitcher Julio Teheran heard the child get hit and crouched down on the mound in obvious anguish. Gomez also looked toward the stands with concern. Someone in the Braves dugout threw a towel into the stands, but the boy did not appear to be bleeding.

The unidentified child was hustled up the aisle by medical personnel. The Braves said he was 'conscious and talkative' while being treated at Turner Field, before he was transported to a hospital.

'The team and all of Braves Country have him in our thoughts and prayers,' the Braves said in a statement.

'That was scary for me,' Teheran said. 'I knew it hit somebody. It was a fast and hard. No one had a chance to get out of the way.'

He sent his best wishes to the child.

'If anyone knows him, please let him know I hope he’s fine,' Teheran said.

Gomez visited the child on Wednesday in the hospital.

'Just went to see the young fan that was hit by my foul ball last night,' Gomez wrote on Twitter. “He was in great spirits and I had a chance to sign the ball.'

Gomez also said, 'You don’t like to see anyone get hurt, especially a child. Fans, please be alert and bring your glove!'

Gomez also reminded fans to be alert during the game in case hard hit balls come flying into the stands
