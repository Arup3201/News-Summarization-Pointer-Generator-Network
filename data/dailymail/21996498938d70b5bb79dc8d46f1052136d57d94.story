BlackBerry is to give its BBM software away to iPhone and Android users in a bit to boost its popularity and stop consumers switching to rival handsets.

Speaking at BlackBerry Live - a three-day annual event in Orlando - BlackBerry's CEO Thorsten Heins said the firm's popular BBM messaging software will be available on the iPhone and Android handsets for the first time.

He also announced a low cost handset with a keyboard many believe could be the firm's last attempt at survival.

'It’s time to bring BBM to a greater audience,' said Thorsten Heins as he announced a massive shift is BlackBerry's messaging service.

The messaging service is hugely popular among users, with more than 60 million active monthly users.

The BBM messaging service will arrive on the iPhone and Android in the summer with the messaging and groups features.

BBM voice, screen sharing, video and channels will be rolled out later, allowing the firm to compete with Google Talk and Apple's iMessage.

However, it will also face competition from newer services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat which are hugely popular.

CEO Thorsten Heins said the time is right to offer BBM on rival devices.

'It's time to bring BBM to a greater audience,' Heins said.

'I cannot wait for the day when all of our BlackBerry fans can send BBM invites to all their friends on other platforms.

'They have asked us for this for years.'

The new lower cost handset was also unveiled.

The Q5 will be available in red, black, white and pink. 

It has a physical QWERTY keyboard as well as a 3.1inch touchscreen. 

The Q5 has a metal casing, which is a break away from previous BlackBerry handsets which were predominantly made of plastic. 

The phone will run BlackBerry's latest operating system, BlackBerry 10.

It will be the third handset to be released running this version.

'BlackBerry is excited to bring the new BlackBerry Q5 smartphone to our customers in selected markets around world,' said Heins.

'The BlackBerry Q5 gives you the best
of everything with its cutting-edge BlackBerry 10 functionality and a 
physical QWERTY keyboard.

Grammy Award-winning singer Alicia Keys, who was named BlackBerry's global creative director in January, announced the company's new BlackBerry Scholars Program. The new initiative will begin this year and provide scholarships in science-based studies for students around the globe.

'It is for youthful fans that are 
passionate, confident and bold, and it makes it easy for them to have 
fun, create, share and stay connected.'

He said the 'slim, sleek' device will be available in red, black, white and pink.

'I know it's going to be a big hit,' Heins said.

'I think you're really gonna like it.' 

BlackBerry 10 comes with Instant Action shortcuts that let you flick words up and down while typing, to make writing messages and emails quicker.

You can easily switch, or 'flow' between apps using the sidebar navigation and task manager.

The Q5 will also come with BlackBerry Time Shift Mode and Story Maker and you can switch your BlackBerry Messenger chat to a BBM Video conversation, plus share your screen with friends with BlackBerry 10.

The BlackBerry Q5 will be available across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America, with from July. 

Heins said the Q5 is designed to appeal to 'emerging markets', suggesting the handset will be a low-cost option.

Heins, who became RIM's CEO in January 2012, said the company has made a lot of progress in a short period of time, by moving a diverse collection of people into leadership positions.

He restated BlackBerry's committed to 'mobile first' and took a subtle jab at industry predictions that he might not make it to this year's conference as CEO because of the competitive mobile landscape.

'I'm happy to say they were wrong,' Heins said.

The Q5 is expected to be aimed at emerging markets and those who cannot afford a higher end smartphone

'We are not only still here. We are firing on all cylinders as a company.'

RIM's iconic BlackBerry device, introduced in 1999, was the dominant smartphone for on-the-go business people and consumers before the iPhone debuted in 2007. The device showed that phones could handle much more than email and calls.

Though RIM continues to do well in many overseas markets, the company faced numerous delays modernizing its operating system in an effort to compete with the iPhone and smartphones running Google's Android operating system.

RIM's stock fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.58 in morning trading Tuesday.

Heins said that RIM is 'definitely in the race' and that he is excited about its outlook.

'The most successful year for BlackBerry is well under way," he said.

Grammy Award-winning singer Alicia Keys, who was named BlackBerry's global creative director in January, announced the company's new BlackBerry Scholars Program.

The new initiative will begin this year and provide scholarships in science-based studies for students around the globe.

'I was inspired. I wanted to take this journey with BlackBerry,' Keys said.

The scholarship program hopes to attract women, who Keys said make up more than half of mobile users.

'It's the beginning for a powerful network of women and a profound change in our culture,' she said.

The firm also launched a range of celebrity endorsements and channels, including a Mercedes channel launched by Lewis Hamilton (pictured)

It's expected to cost around £130 ($200) although no official announcement on the price has been announced.

Adam Leach, principal device and platforms analyst at Ovum said: 'The Q5 could be a very significant device for the company, as there is a significant opportunity for high-quality low-cost smartphones.

'Emerging markets accounted for roughly 17% of the nearly 450 million smartphone shipments globally in 2011 and Ovum projects that emerging markets will account for nearly 40% of the 1.7 billion smartphone devices shipped globally in 2017.

'Blackberry is clearly aiming to replicate the success of the Blackberry Curve in emerging markets, doing so will help the company establish the Blackberry 10 platform in the market.

However, Blackberry has significant competition in this area with a number of handset manufacturers championing an array of low-cost Android devices as well as Nokia’s Asha 501.

'The crucial aspect of the Q5 launch will be its price and if  Blackberry can address the sub-$100 smartphone opportunity.'
