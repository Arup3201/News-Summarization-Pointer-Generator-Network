Authorities hunting for the driver of a pickup truck that hit and dragged an autistic California man more than 100 feet have released video they hope will help lead to an arrest.

Jeff Bell, 24, of Stanton, is shown in the grisly April 23 video being hit, dragged and left for dead in the middle of a busy street as he walked to a nearby bus stop – he is still hospitalized from those injuries.

Investigators have had little luck tracking down the person behind the wheel of the teal mid-1990s GMC pickup truck that mowed Bell down, they announced at a Friday news conference, and are asking for the public’s help.

Impact: The moment Jeff Bell is hit by the nearly 20-year-old GMC truck

‘It sickens me. That’s not just some human being, that’s my boy,’ Michael Bell, the victim’s father, lamented at the news conference aired by KTLA. ‘His scalp was basically torn from his head. It took 38 staples to attach it.’

Jeff Bell suffered burns and abrasions to more than 20 per cent of his body, authorities said.The ailing man’s father claimed he was on his way to work after recently getting a job at an office supplies store.

‘We understand that accidents happen. But making a conscious decision to drag someone 100 feet across the asphalt and drive away, without helping him, leaving him for dead — that’s no accident,’ he continued.

Horrifying: Bell suffered cuts and abrasions to nearly 20 per cent of his body, and his scalp took 38 stitches to fully reattach, his father said

Left for dead: The driver kept going even after Bell came unattached from the truck's underside

The truck’s front end sustained damage after the impact, and there were also stickers on the outside of the rear window, cops said.

The Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs has offered a $5,000 reward for anyone who provides information leading to the driver’s arrest.

‘Only a coward could knowingly inflict such pain on another human being and leave them for dead in the middle of the street,’ said association president Tom Dominguez.

‘It is a miracle Mr. Bell managed to survive.’
