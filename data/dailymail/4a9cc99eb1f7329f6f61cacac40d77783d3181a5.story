It is the off-court romance that has been the talk of Wimbledon.

But yesterday there was one woman who was not so keen on discussing Serena Williams’ relationship with her tennis coach – namely, his wife.

This is the first picture of Clarisse Mouratoglou, who is reported to be divorcing her husband Patrick after learning of the attachment.

Feeling the strain: Clarisse Mouratoglou, 40, who has started divorce proceedings against her husband, tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou, 43, who is having an alleged affair with U.S. tennis star Serena Williams, 31

Mr Mouratoglu, 43, began coaching Miss Williams, 31, after she crashed out of the French Open in May last year.

They were first pictured holding each other’s hands last September.

Yesterday lunchtime, Mrs Mouratoglou, 40, looked as though she was feeling the strain as she left the offices of her husband’s company, where she still works, in Montfort-l’Amaury, France.

Wearing a grey scarf and cardigan and her blonde hair swept back into a bun, she refused to speak about the situation before driving away in a cream Mini.

Courtship: Mr Mouratoglou with Miss Williams at 
Wimbledon yesterday. The relationship was aired in public on Saturday when rival 
tennis star Maria Sharapova spoke about it at a press conference

The relationship was aired in public 
on Saturday when Maria Sharapova spoke about it at a press conference, 
after Miss Williams had called her ‘boring’ in an interview.

She said: ‘If Serena wants to talk 
about something personal, she should talk about her relationship and her
boyfriend who was married, who is getting a divorce and who has kids – 
and not draw attention to other things.’

Afterwards,
Miss Williams refused to comment on her relationship, but said she had 
become ‘more intense’ on court thanks to her coach’s training.

It
is not clear when the marriage broke down, but the French press have 
reported the couple are divorcing because of the relationship with Miss 
Williams.

A colleague said Mrs Mouratoglou, an interior designer, still works with her husband at his company, PM Management Consulting.

Mrs Mouratoglou has been heavily involved in the day-to-day running of the company since it was founded 10 years ago.

It is one of five companies owned by Mr Mouratoglou. His other interests include his tennis academy and property company.

Sharapova in action: She and Miss Williams traded catty remarks and insulted each other's boyfriends after
the American called the Russian 'boring'

Mrs Mouratoglou has travelled the world with her husband for tennis tournaments and used to also work for his academy.

She is his second wife and the mother of his two young daughters, Charlotte and Juliette.

The couple own several large properties in the area that they have renovated.

At Mr Mouratoglou’s tennis academy in Thiverval, ten miles from where Mrs Mouratoglou was pictured, there is a large black and white picture of Miss Williams.

At the family home close by, a neighbour yesterday said that Mr Mouratoglou still lived there but his daughters only visited at weekends.

He said: ‘The girls come at weekends and you hear them playing. I see Mr Mouratoglou but I have never seen Serena Williams here.’

It comes after Miss Williams said she had apologised to her rival Miss Sharapova over their war of words in the run-up to Wimbledon.

The pair had traded catty remarks and insulted each other’s boyfriends after Miss Williams called the Russian ‘boring’ in an interview in America.

Yesterday, Miss Sharapova said she wanted to ‘move on’ now that Wimbledon had started but admitted she was not close to other players.

She said: ‘I wouldn’t say I’m really close to a lot of players.

‘I think just because you’re in the same sport doesn’t mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you’re categorised, you’re a tennis player, so you’re going to get along with tennis players.’
