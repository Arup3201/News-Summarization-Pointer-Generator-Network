Grandfather: Christopher Carlson, 45, was found guilty of three of six charges of child abuse

A man who forced his three grandsons on a series of grueling Grand Canyon treks has been jailed for just 27 months - because the judge said he could tell he loves his young relatives.

Christopher Alan Carlson, 45, made the trio of overweight boys, aged eight, nine and 12, walk on a 15 mile and then a 19 mile hike in 100 degree temperatures in August last year.

He thought trekking in the extreme heat 'would get them into shape' - and punished them for going too slow by kicking or hitting them.

After the hikes, the Indianapolis 'fitness freak' only allowed his hungry charges to eat healthy food like tofu, hummus and veggie burgers.

He was handed the minimum possible sentence and, because he has already served 10 months behind bars, could be out in under a year.

U.S. District Judge Frederick Martone said the fact Carlson 'obviously cares very much for his grandchildren' led to the lighter punishment.

He also said that Carlson's suffering of attention-deficit disorder and hyperactivity for his whole life had spared him from being locked up for the maximum of 17 years.

Carlson told the court he would never hurt his grandchildren and that he just wanted to show them the beauty of the Grand Canyon. Shackled at the hands and ankles, and dressed in a black-and-white prison uniform, he said: 'I love my grandchildren greatly.

'I wanted to afford these children a beautiful opportunity at a young age to experience something magnificent.'

Carlson is such a young grandfather because he had his first child - Tara Danaher, the mother of the boys - when he was just 15.

Danaher was 17 when her oldest was born. In all, Carlson has five children, all with different mothers. The boys are now living with their grandmother in Indiana.

They said they love their grandfather and loved spending last summer traveling to various countries with him.

But the oldest boy Kevin also testified to jurors that he secretly asked a hiker to call emergency medical services towards the end of the final hike after he began throwing up.

He also fell down because of cramping and experienced changes to his vision.

Torture: The boys were given no food and water from sunrise to sunset

He said: 'I needed medical attention and I was hurting. He was hitting and pushing me and calling me fat. I was scared and it was hard and I was all weak and tired and kind of hurt.'

The middle boy, Micah, said he suffered excruciating pain from the blisters on the bottom of his feet, later undergoing treatment that is usually used for burn victims.

And the youngest, Kameron, joined his two siblings in saying their grandfather kicked them repeatedly with steel-toed boots and threw them into cactuses.

He also choked, pinched, pushed and squeezed them.

The court heard how a ranger with binoculars spotted the group during that day's hike, the same day a man died on another trail from heat exposure.

The ranger reported seeing Carlson shoving the oldest boy and whipping him with a rolled-up t-shirt.

Once they caught up with them, rangers fed and gave the boys water after one showed symptoms of heat stroke and the other two had signs of heat exhaustion and dehydration.

During trial, defence attorney Jeffrey Williams portrayed Carlson as an active health nut who had a firm hand and wanted to show the boys the world.

Prosecutors told jurors that Carlson deprived the boys of food and water during the hikes.

The boys reported that they did get some water, but not always enough, and ate celery and other snacks during the hike.

A jury found Carlson guilty in February of three counts of child abuse stemming from the August 28 hike, but not guilty of any abuse on the August 15 hike.
