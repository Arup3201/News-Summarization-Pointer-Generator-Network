Edward Wright, 52, was jailed for repeatedly sexually abusing three boys worked with vulnerable children

A pervert jailed for sexually abusing three boys worked with vulnerable children for six years after police checks failed to spot he had been convicted of spanking children.

Edward Wright, 52, received a caution for indecently assaulting youngsters aged 12 and 16 by smacking them in 1993.

But the incident was not reported in a police Criminal Records Bureau check.

The sex attacks should have seen Wright immediately rejected by Westminster's Youth Service in central London.

But the CRB check came back clear and the sexual predator was able to work with children aged as young as seven until he was arrested last year.

Police and former work colleagues now fear Wright may have abused more children in his care and urged any victims to come forward.

The Metropolitan Police has blamed 'human error' for failing to spot Wright's caution.

A Met Police spokeswoman said: 'Though the record of the caution was located during the vetting process, it was not passed to the disclosure team for further consideration.'

Wright was caged for six-and-a-half years yesterday for repeatedly assaulting three little boys between 1986 and 1994.

All three of the paedophile's victims, including two brothers, went on to become drink and drug abusers, while one of them is now serving a life sentence for murder, the Old Bailey heard.

Wright, of Streatham, south London, was convicted of three counts of buggery, having already admitted possessing a 'large number' of pornographic images of children.

There are no formal allegations of child abuse during his time working for Westminster between 2005 and 2011.

But the council said Wright was officially cautioned for inappropriate behaviour after he offered a child a lift outside of work hours.

One of his former colleagues at Westminster said he feared he may have abused other youngsters.

The outraged man, who did not want to be named, said: 'My worst fear is that he has done things to young people that we knew and Westminster allowed it to happen.

'We raised concerns about his inappropriate behaviour but they were swept under the carpet.

'A lot of us didn't trust him around young people but he was still able to take children on trips away.'

Westminster's director of family services, James Thomas, said the council acted promptly to suspend Wright in February 2011 and was 'deeply shocked to learn of the allegations against him'.

Mr Thomas said 'no Westminster young person has been identified as a victim' but the council continues to work closely with police.

A police spokeswoman said 'refresher training' had been introduced for staff.

Detective Inspector Justin Armstrong said: 'It is possible he may have committed further crimes.'
