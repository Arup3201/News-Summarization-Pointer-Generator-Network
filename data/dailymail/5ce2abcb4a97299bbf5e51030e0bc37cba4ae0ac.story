At first their mother put it down to coincidence: one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand, the other using her left.

But when Naomi and Hannah Moxon’s baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths, their mother Karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins.

The rare condition, which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins, refers to twins who are mirror images of one another.

Like in many cases, Naomi is left handed, while Hannah writes with her right. When they eat, Naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way, while Hannah’s knife and fork are held in reverse.

And their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads – Hannah’s on the left, Naomi’s on the right.

Yesterday the 19-year-olds, from Peterborough, who are currently competing in BBC talent show The Voice, opened up about their unusual situation.

Naomi said: ‘Our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands. She would say raise the hand you use to draw and I'd raise one and Hannah would raise the other.

'Then mum mentioned it at one of our check-ups and that's when they said about mirror twins. I don’t think many people know what it is.'

‘There were other things like I use my knife and fork the wrong way round,’ Hannah added, ‘our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well, one of mine would fall out and then within a few days Naomi lost the same tooth on the other side. Also our partings are naturally opposite, although we sometimes wear it the same.’

In other respects, Hannah and Naomi are remarkably similar, made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike.

They share a bedroom – and wardrobe – and they do their make-up in the same way. When they made it through the blind auditions round of The Voice as singing duo Classical Reflections, they wore matching white dresses to perform Nella Fantasia by Sarah Brightman.

Hannah said: ‘We like dressing the same, but not always. It's part of our performing act. What's good is that I can ask her to try something on so I can see what it looks like. And we always talk about what suits “us” not what suits “me”.’ ‘We started off as half a person,’ Naomi joked.

The pair often finish each other’s sentences, have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking – ‘If someone’s being annoying we can share it with each other with a look,’ Naomi said.

Speaking about their close bond, Hannah said: ‘We rely on each other a lot, we’re very protective of each other. At school we had a bad experience, we were teased quite a lot for being different to the other children, because we were twins. People would try to tell us apart by being like "oh you're the one with the fatter face" and "you're the one with the longer face", So we were very shy.’

However they left that school for an arts-based sixth form college where they developed their singing act, performing at local community events and weddings.

And tonight the Moxon twins, who live with their mother Karen, 50, and father David, 48, will perform on The Voice on BBC1.

When they first appeared on the programme they divided opinion on Twitter, with dozens of viewers writing mean spirited remarks about the twins.

Some likened them to the ghostly twins in horror film The Shining.

However, last night Naomi said their past experience of being teased at school meant they didn’t take the messages to heart.

She said: ‘I think sometimes it is a bit difficult for people because we are different, as twins, and sometimes people don’t know how to take that, so there was the odd slightly mean comment, like about The Shining, but the vast majority were lovely.

'Also I think because of our past experiences we’ve become really strong people and those sorts of comments don’t really affect us anymore.

'I think a lot of the time people don’t realise what they’re saying could be hurtful, like with the comments about The Shining – they are twins, we are twins, it’s a fact.

'We would always say to people just be careful what you write online, you might mean it harmlessly but it could be taken differently. But even those comments we just have to laugh at them really. We looked up the film because we’d never seen it before and it didn’t actually offend us.’

She added: ‘We feel really, really thankful for the response on social media.

It’s been so lovely. Such a high percentage of the comments have been so positive and even the slightly negative ones, they weren’t aimed at our singing at all.’

Mirror twins, though rare are not unheard of and occur when a fertilised egg splits late.

Normally, eggs split around two or three days after fertilisation happens, causing identical twins.

However, if the split doesn’t occur until day seven, it can lead to mirror twins. Later splits – at around day 12 – cause conjoined twins.

Around a quarter of identical twins are thought to be mirror twins.

Yesterday Jane Denton, director of the Multiple Births Foundation, said that investigating mirror twins was difficult.

 ‘It is difficult to research this because it happens in utero so you can’t observe it outside the body,' she said.

But we think it happens in about 25 per cent of monozygotic (identical) twins. It’s usually the right hand in one, the left hand in the other, sometimes it’s the hair wall, the crown of the head, which way round it goes.

‘Research indicates that in identical twins it is usual for the teeth to grow in the same place in the mouth, within a day or two of each other.

'But with mirror twins you may find that it will be on the other side of the mouth in one child, but in the same sort of pattern.’
