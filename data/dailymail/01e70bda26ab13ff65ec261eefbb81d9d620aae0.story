Relaxing on a cruise ship on one of their many luxury holidays, Andrew Kenny, Victoria Tracey and their children appear to have it all.

The couple drove cars with personalised number plates and had paid off the mortgage on their home despite being only in their thirties.

Few in their social circle had any reason to doubt their good fortune was anything other than hard-earned.

In fact their lifestyle was funded by a £65,000 benefits swindle – a crime which has now put them behind bars.

The couple told their local council 
that Kenny, 39, was landlord of the property and Tracey, 33, was his 
tenant, and drew up false tenancy agreements to back up their story.

This enabled them to collect up to £1,200 a month on their home in Gateacre, Liverpool – enough to pay the mortgage.

But
 the pair were really a couple with two young children, and a third 
thought to be from another relationship, who they took on the luxury 
holidays with them.

As he 
tried desperately to maintain the sham, Kenny denied he was their father
 until one fraud investigator pointed out he had tattoos with their 
names and birth dates on his arms. Both Kenny and Tracey wept as they 
were accused of falsely claiming the benefits over four years.

Reginald
 Mills, prosecuting, said: ‘This was a joint enterprise. They have acted
 together to intentionally defraud money from the  public purse in order
 to pay the mortgage on that house while maintaining the lifestyle that 
they were living.’

Mr Mills
 said Kenny insisted he wasn’t the father of his children. ‘He denied it
 until it was pointed out to him that he had tattoos all over his body 
that detailed the names and dates of birth of the children, at which 
point he caved,’ he said.

The
 court heard that Tracey was able to falsely claim £35,894 in housing 
benefit and income support over four years from November 2008. Kenny 
received £28,145 over the same period.

The couple cheated the welfare system and claimed over £65,000 in illegal benefits

Several
 photographs were  produced showing the couple enjoying a variety of 
luxury holidays – including cruises – with their children. On one cruise
 they sailed on the Royal Caribbean Independence of the Seas liner  to 
Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Madeira.

Kenny
 and Tracey also bought personalised number plates for their cars, 
including a silver VW Cabriolet, and paid off their mortgage early, the 
court was told.

Phillip Tully, defending, said Tracey was a ‘respected member of the community’ who took full responsibility for her actions.

‘This
 is not someone who is a professional fraudster,’ he said. ‘She made a 
very foolish decision to become involved in this and she shows genuine 
remorse.

‘She was a respected member of the community who was highly thought of by people and this was totally out of character.’

Jailing
 the pair for nine months each, Judge Robert Warnock said: ‘The fraud 
was straightforward. Over a period of four years you maintained the 
deception that you were not living in a common household.

‘The
 best illustration of your greed and dishonesty is the use of defrauded 
public money to pay the remortgage on your property.’

Liverpool City Council brought the prosecution and also acted on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions.

A
 council spokesman said: ‘During these difficult economic times, it is 
more vital than ever that benefits go to those who are eligible.

‘The message from this court case is clear – you could end up behind bars if you falsely claim benefits.’
