Facebook has unveiled an enormous new office in Silicon Valley, which is large enough to hold a 9-acre park on its roof, and will house 2,800 workers in a single room.

The new building in Menlo Park, California, measures 430,000 square feet and apparently has the 'largest open floor plan in the world'.

The social network's newest location was revealed by founder Mark Zuckerberg, who posted an aerial view on the building on his public page.

Settling in: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is pictured above having a meeting in an office-cum-ball pit, which was seemingly crammed with plastic playthings as a first-day prank

He wrote: 'Our goal was to create the perfect engineering space for our teams to work together.

'We wanted our space to create the same sense of community and connection among our teams that we try to enable with our services across the world.

To do this, we designed the largest open floor plan in the world - a single room that fits thousands of people.'

California skies: The office is not far from Facebook's current Silicon Valley campus - to which it is connected by tunnel

As well as the huge open space, which has yet to be pictured, there will be smaller spaces for meetings.

One Facebook employee posted an image of Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer meeting in one room, which had been filled with plastic balls - seemingly a first-day prank.

According to local news outlet The Almanac, 2,800 engineers will eventually work in the main, open room. They have reportedly not all been hired yet.

Trendy: The building will one day play host to 2,800 Facebook employees - but it is not yet at capacity

Construction on the new building, which is not far from Facebook's existing campus, and will be connected via tunnel, was started in September 2014.

And despite the simple philosophy behind it, the new Facebook building still has plenty of capacity to impress.

An army of Instagram stars was unleashed on the building, and captured its quirky stairways, unusual paintjobs and sculpture pieces made by Bay Area artists.
