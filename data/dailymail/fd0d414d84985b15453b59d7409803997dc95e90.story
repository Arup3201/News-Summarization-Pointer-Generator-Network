Taking a break: Jenny Winder has been branded a 'hypocrite' for arranging a holiday in term time

A head teacher has been branded a ‘hypocrite’ for arranging to take a holiday abroad in term-time when parents would be fined for doing the same.

Jenny Winder, 53, is due to fly to the Caribbean for a week in January, shortly after the Christmas holiday has ended.

The trip is understood to have been nodded through by the chairman of governors at Elstow School, near Bedford, and was not officially announced.

Earlier this week figures showed a crackdown on pupils’ term-time holidays had caused attendance to soar. Families face a £60 fine per parent per child for unauthorised absence.

The school, judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in 2009, reminds parents on its website to book breaks ‘only in holiday time’ and encourages pupils to achieve ‘highest possible levels of attendance’.

One mother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is disgraceful. [Mrs Winder] is a hypocrite. We can’t take holidays in term-time so why should she? The school is fast enough threatening parents with fines if they take their children out.’

A father added: ‘It is one rule for one and one for another. She shouldn’t have been allowed to go … Teachers’ holidays are long enough … this is arrogant.’

Families are only allowed to take children out of school in ‘exceptional circumstances’ under measures brought in by the last education secretary, Michael Gove. Previously, heads had the discretion to allow pupils up to ten days’ leave each year.

Parents wanted the flexibility of term-time holidays to avoid the punishing premiums holiday firms add in peak periods.

Now they face a £60 fine each for every child who fails to attend school without permission – meaning a two-parent two-child family would be charged £240.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, jailed for up to three months and fined £2,500.

Mrs Winder has been in charge of mixed primary Elstow School for nearly 15 years and is paid around £45,000 a year. On her Friends Reunited page, she describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead.

Caribbean: The head is likely to enjoy a week of sunny weather where average daytime temperatures of 28C

The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. Her leave was granted by chairman of governors Kevin Hunter in June, an insider told a local newspaper, saying: ‘Mr Hunter told the governors he … had agreed it and that they had to pass it … Three governors have since resigned, stating other reasons … the chairman now needs to take responsibility and resign himself.’

Mr Hunter said Mrs Winder was ‘devoted, well-liked, extremely hard-working and effective’, adding: ‘She made a request for a week off during term-time for personal reasons which we have judged to be appropriate.’

A Bedford council spokesman said ‘individual requests for leave are a matter for schools themselves to determine’. Mrs Winder refused to comment.
