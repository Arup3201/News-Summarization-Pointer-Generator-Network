A transgender golfer from Arizona is teeing up for the competition of her life after qualifying for the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour.

Dr Bobbi Lancaster credits golf with helping her as she struggled with her identity before having gender reassignment surgery in 2010.

The 63-year-old doctor, born Robert Lancaster, will be the first transgender player to take part in a tournament since the LPGA's historic vote just over three years ago.

After a tough season in which Dr Lancaster felt under scrutiny from fellow players and spectators, the golfer said she is mentally prepared for the tournament.

'I really feel like I'm in a much better place emotionally now where I can bring my best game and compete,' she told ABC News.

Her optimistic outlook shows how much
 Dr Lancaster has overcome. For decades she fought her instinct that she 
was a woman, and even married and had three children.

Dr Lancaster was six when she first started to feel like she wanted to be a girl.

'I was confused and I didn't know why I had these feelings,' she told 12 News. 'I didn't know who to talk to about it.'

Despite her feelings, Dr Lancaster met and fell in love with her second wife Lucy. The couple married but a few years later Dr Lancaster fell into a depression and even considered taking her own life.Â 

When her wife found a suicide note 
written by her husband, Dr Lancaster finally had the courage to move 
forward with her life - and had the support of Lucy throughout.

'Nothing really changed. I still have the same heart,' Dr Lancaster said.

The golfer admitted that at 6ft tall, and 63 years old, she stood out on the green among her young competitors.

But when she submitted medical test results to the LPGA it showed her hormone levels were in the same region as other women competitors.

The adjustment process after her surgery has also reduced muscle mass, again leveling the playing field, AZ Central reported.

The golf association has also been supportive. After the relevant paperwork and laboratory results were handed in, it never became an issue.

Its senior vice-president, Heather Daly-Donofrio, has also been supportive of Dr Lancaster.

Now it just falls to Dr Lancaster to prove herself on the green, after qualifying for the association's developmental Symetra Tour 2014.

Prepared: Bobbi Lancaster says she is emotionally ready for the competition

'[I] feel I have made great strides and am excited about the 2014 competitive year,' she told USA Today.

She added that as her story became well known, she received a huge response from hundreds of people who were inspired by her experiences.

'This was the best part for me. I felt I was making a difference and healing in many situations,' Dr Lancaster said.
