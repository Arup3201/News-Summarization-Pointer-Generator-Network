He found himself the unwilling participant in a fracas between Lindsay Lohan and Florida psychic Tiffany Eve Mitchell at a Manhattan nightclub on Wednesday night - which led to Lohan's arrest.

But a smiling Max George didn't look too bothered by the star's fate, or all the attention surrounding him as he returned to his hotel after performing at New York's Madison Square Garden on Thursday.

The Wanted singer planted a kiss on one waiting lady, and wrapped his arms around her as he posed for a picture on her camera phone

Sealed with a kiss: Max George from The Wanted plants a kiss on a fan as he returned to his hotel after a second night of performing at Madison Square Garden on Thursday night

Wearing a casual black hoodie and black trousers, Max smiled as he hugged another fan holding a camera.

Max and British The Wanted had just been supporting Justin Bieber for the second night.

On stage, the diminutive star made no mention of Wednesday night's fracas, but posted on his Twitter: 'Eventful night.'

Max split from his fiancée, British soap star Michelle Keegan in August and a
band source told MailOnline; 'Max is a single guy, he is flirtatious, 
and a lot of women find him attractive. He's free to play around.'

After the concert, Lohan, 26, and a friend joined Max and his bandmates Jay McGuiness and Tom Parker at the club.

Apparently a fight broke out near 
where a riled Lohan, a very drunk Max and the Tiffany Eve Mitchell and her husband were partying - 
and it is not yet clear how it involved The Wanted singer.

Police sources said Mitchell claimed 
the actress knocked her to the ground with a strong blow to the left 
side of her face,with sources saying Mitchell 'suffered swelling and 
substantial pain to the face,'  but refused medical attention, even 
though an ambulance was called.

Police
were called, and Mitchell identified Lohan as her attacker.

The actress had already left the venue but police later intercepted a car in which she was passenger and made the arrest.

As she was led away in handcuffs, the star is believed to have yelled: 'Oh my God! I didn't touch anyone!'

She kept repeating: 'Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?'

Lohan was 
later taken to the 10th Precinct Station House in Manhattan, where she 
was accused of misdemeanor assault.

She received a desk appearance 
ticket and will have to appear in court on January 7. She was described as being 'visibly tired'.

The 
actress's day got worse when California prosecutors filed charges 
against her over a car crash on the Pacific Coast Highway in June, in 
which she rammed her Porsche into the back of a dump truck while on her 
way to the set of her TV movie Liz & Dick.

The
flame-haired star allegedly lied to police, telling them she was the 
passenger in the car, when, in fact, she was the driver.

The
three charges are obstructing or resisting a police officer, providing 
false information to a police officer, and reckless driving.

According
to reports, Lohan told officers that her assistant Gavin Doyle had been
behind the wheel. But Santa Monica police said in a statement: 'During 
the subsequent investigation, information was developed that Lohan was 
the driver of the Porsche when the accident occurred.'

The legal implications for Lohan are more serious because she was probation at the time of the June 8 crash.
