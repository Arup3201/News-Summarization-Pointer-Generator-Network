A spelling error by hospital staff meant they missed a crucial chance to help a troubled mother who later killed herself.

NHS workers made a tiny keyboard mistake that left them unaware of Marie Natalie Piner’s long history of depression.

The records that would have shown her mental health issues were missed, and the young mother was discharged.

Marie Natalie Piner was found dead after she was discharged from hospital. A spelling blunder by NHS staff meant they were unaware of her long history of depression

The 36-year-old was later found dead in a car in her home town of Clacton, Essex after taking an overdose of prescription pills.

The
 computer system used at the hospital at the centre of the incident has 
now been revamped following the death, an inquest heard. The hearing was
 told that staff at Colchester General Hospital saw Mrs Piner on 
November 27 last year. They inputted her maiden name L’Aimable on a 
computer – but left off the vital apostrophe.

The mistake meant her long history of treatment for depression did not appear on screen.

She was still referred to mental health staff, who carried out an assessment but then discharged her.

Just
 weeks later on December 8 last year, Mrs Piner was reported missing 
after she phoned her daughter and a friend, warning them that she had 
large amounts of pills and intended to take them all.

The
 disappearance sparked a major search involving a police helicopter and 
lifeboats. Mrs Piner was found dead four days later in a Mercedes C180 
in a Clacton car park.

A 
toxicology report showed she had a fatal amount of the prescription 
opiate Tramadol in her system. A spokesman for North Essex Partnership, 
which carried out the mental health assessment, said a revamped computer
 system is set to go live from October. 

Changes mean that slight mistakes on spellings will still yield search results.

The
 spokesman said: ‘Mrs Piner was referred for assessment in November 2012
 following treatment in a general hospital setting, but under her maiden
 name L’Aimable and unfortunately without the apostrophe.

‘During her assessment she did not disclose her previous psychiatric history.

‘Regrettably
 the consequence was that at the end of her mental health assessment, 
with the information available, and with Mrs Piner’s agreement, no 
further support was required from the Trust at that time.’

Essex assistant coroner Eleanor McGann ruled the death was a suicide as a result of an overdose. 

She said: ‘Mrs Piner had a very high level of Tramadol in her system - much higher than would be required to kill somebody.’
