Going home: Happy Feet in his ice-lined air conditioned room at Wellington's Zoo. Today he was being taken back to his natural environment after undergoing life-saving surgery

He captivated the world when he was found wandering on a New Zealand beach 3,000 miles from home, desperately ill after eating sand he thought was snow.

Now Happy Feet, the lost emperor penguin, is on his way home to Antarctica after two months recovering at Wellington Zoo.

The 3ft-tall bird, named after the 2006 film, began his journey back to cooler southern waters yesterday.

He will make the four-day trip inside a custom-made crate – kept cool with 60 buckets of ice – on board the research vessel Tangaroa.

He was found at Peka Peka beach on June 20, and underwent lifesaving surgery to remove 7lb of sand from his stomach.

Since then the one-year-old has been nursed back to health at the zoo, where he was fed on fish milkshakes.  

He won the hearts of 250,000 fans who watched his progress on a web camera. More than 1,700 of those gathered to bid him farewell on Sunday.

Happy Feet has even been fitted with a GPS tracker, so his admirers will be able to follow him once he is released into the wild.

Lisa Argilla, a vet, said he has a ‘stronger and stroppier attitude’ than when he was found. ‘He’s definitely a survivor,’ she said.

The one-year-old has put on 18lb at Wellington Zoo in the last two months after 7lb of sand, sticks and stones were removed from his stomach.

He was fed on a diet of fish milkshakes in an air-conditioned room.

Yesterday he was moved to the research vessel Tangaroa ready to be taken to the Southern Ocean. Comedian Stephen Fry was among the people to visit Happy Feet while he was being nursed back to health.

Vets placed him in a custom-made crate for the journey. He will be kept cool with 60 buckets of ice and fed fish as he makes his way home.

His story has touched people from around the world. A web camera set up at the zoo has attracted about a quarter of a million viewers - despite the penguin doing little more than eating, sleeping and waddling.

'He's brought a lot of hope and joy 
to people,' said Karen Fifield, Wellington Zoo's chief executive. 'His 
story has driven to the heart of what makes us human.'

He had been eating wet sand on Peka Peka Beach to keep cool. The Tangaroa is New Zealand's largest
research vessel and was already scheduled to head to southern waters to
check on fish numbers in order to set quotas.

He will be released after four days at sea at a latitude of 51 degrees south.

The boat's skipper Richard O'Driscoll
said that once the Tangaroa has reached the drop-off point, he will 
likely cut the engines and then release the penguin from the deck into 
the sea with a makeshift canvas slide.

More
than 1,700 people gathered at the zoo yesterday to say a final goodbye 
to Happy Feet, who was visible in a glassed area while getting final 
medical checks.

Dr Argilla said that by next year Happy Feet he will be old enough to find a mate and breed.

She
added: 'He'll hopefully bump into some penguins that he recognises. 
Otherwise, he'll probably establish himself in another colony.'

Where he was found: The washed up emperor penguin walks along Peka Peka Beach in New Zealand - 3,000 miles north of its home in Antarctica

Where he should be: Emperor penguins walk over the ice in Antarctica

Life-saving: A team of medics operate on the 
penguin - named Happy Feet - who ended up 3,000 miles away from home and
became sick after eating sand it mistook for snow. He was found on June 20
