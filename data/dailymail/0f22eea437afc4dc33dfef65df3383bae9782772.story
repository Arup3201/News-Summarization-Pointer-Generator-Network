Villagers are accusing French shooting parties of coming to England and turning their country lanes into the ‘Wild West’.

Residents in Kent say they are overrun with car loads of Frenchmen who cross the Channel to shoot game but do not follow shooting etiquette.

In one village, Tilmanstone, locals say the men ‘kill anything that moves’ and are shooting too close to roads and footpaths.

Villagers in the English countryside have hit out at French poachers who
are crossing the channel to their fields for shooting sessions. A 
teenage rider was thrown from her horse after it got spooked by sudden 
loud firing last Wednesday - leading to this air ambulance coming to her aid

In the latest incident an 18-year-old 
girl was thrown from her horse after it was spooked by  gunfire.

The 
visitors are thought to be coming to the village, which is eight miles 
from Dover, on day trips and have been given permission to shoot by a 
local landowner.

Mog 
Ovenden, a councillor on Dover council, described them as a danger to 
the public. ‘I find it disgusting that they come to our fields with 
their guns, shooting across our footpaths and frightening horses,’ she 
said.

‘I’d have thought 
France was a big enough country, but they’ve chosen to come and shoot 
here. It is high time they stopped. They disregard any sort of etiquette
for English shooting.’

Air ambulance crews prepare the horse rider for her flight to hospital after the animal was spooked by loud firing - believed to be from French Poachers

Residents
say the men are breaking laws that state firearms should not be 
discharged less than 50ft from a public highway and target protected 
species.

Kent Police confirmed that officers were called after the 18-year-old was thrown from her horse.

A
spokesman said: ‘The neighbourhood officer has spoken with the 
landowner to advise him about the concerns raised and he has agreed to 
speak to the gun users concerned.’

The landowner, who has not been named, said he was not aware of any problems caused by the visitors.
