Shamed Paul Flowers is said to have boasted that he ‘often went for lunch’ with senior Labour figures.

The claim was made by a young male escort who says he met the former Co-operative Bank boss many times over the summer and was even invited by him to a party at the home of a Labour peer.

Flowers’s alleged boast heaps more pressure on the Party, which last week desperately tried  to distance itself from its former ‘favourite banker’ as a slew of sleazy revelations followed our exclusive exposé of his drug abuse last week.

The escort even said Flowers had specifically identified Ed Miliband and Ed Balls as the Labour figures he had lunched with – a claim that the party last night strongly denied.

The new claim comes as The Mail on Sunday publishes photographs showing Flowers and Mr Balls at the same conference in 2010. Both men were on the panel at the three-day Co-operative Party Conference.

Earlier this month, Flowers told MPs he helped to arrange a £50,000 donation by the Co-operative Group to the Shadow Chancellor’s office.

The former escort, who has found other work and does not want to be named, said: ‘Once [Flowers] hit the cocaine, his mouth would go off and he would soon be boasting and dropping names of people who he said he knew and places he had been. 

‘He told us he often went for lunch with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls,  and would speak about meeting important-sounding people in the House of Commons or for lunches in London.’

In another astonishing claim, the escort said Flowers, who was still chairman of the Co-op Bank when they met in April, admitted to being so hooked on Class-A drugs that he had to snort cocaine to sit through lengthy bank board meetings at the CIS Tower in Manchester.

The political war of words  over Paul Flowers intensified yesterday as the Conservatives reacted furiously to claims that they were conducting a ‘smear campaign’ over his links to the Labour leadership.  

Tory chairman Grant Shapps described Ed Miliband as ‘pathetic’ for claiming that the episode ‘showed more about the character of the Prime Minister than about the character of Labour’s relationship with the Co-op’, and for accusing Mr Cameron of trying ‘to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out’.

Mr Shapps said: ‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears.’

And he claimed Mr Miliband’s remarks amounted to hypocrisy ‘from the party that brought  you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband’.

‘McBride was simply the  latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan,’ he added.

‘We suggest that they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’

The escort, who was only 19 during most of their relationship, said: ‘As I got to know him, the scale of his dependency on drugs became clear. He couldn’t get through the day without snorting some. 

‘He told me bank board meetings were the worst and he would have a line at lunchtimes to keep him going through the afternoon session.’ 

The pair were introduced by another escort who had already begun having trysts with the Methodist minister. The escort said: ‘We first met  at the Renaissance hotel in Manchester, where he had a suite he used when he was in the city.

‘I wore a shirt and smart trousers, and he had on a polo shirt and chinos. He was very good company. He was well spoken and intelligent, and we were not short of conversation.

A Labour party spokesperson categorically denied that either Ed Miliband or Ed Balls had lunch with the disgraced Co-op bank chief

‘We had a meal at the hotel and he told me that he was the chairman of the Co-op Bank but he was about to step down. He also said he was a Methodist minister.

‘When I asked him what chairing  a bank entailed, he was a bit short on detail and just said he was mostly a figurehead and not concerned with the actual running of it.

‘We were drinking white wine all evening and then went up to his suite. It was a very large room with a bed that he proudly told me could “comfortably sleep three.” ’

He said they began to meet frequently, with Flowers booking him for £400-a-time ‘overnight sessions’ at his house in Bradford, owned by the Methodist church.

It was at one of these gatherings that Flowers apparently made the claim about his contact with Mr Miliband and Mr Balls.

The political wing of the Co-operative movement could be facing financial crisis of its own next year as the  Co-ope Group’s board reviews its £1million political fund.

Cutting the spending would deal a severe financial blow to the Co-operative Party, a sister group to the Labour Party, whose members include Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and 31 other Labour MPs.

Just two weeks ago the interim members meeting of the  Co-operative Group – the parent company behind the funerals, supermarkets and banking businesses – voted in favour of a £1million fund for political donations in 2014. 

But with the Group reeling from the Paul Flowers scandal, a strategic review is under way and a spokesman for the group confirmed political donations could be cut.

‘Given there is a group-wide strategy review under way, it is safe to assume everything will be looked at. 

‘In the case of political engagement, do we want to make donations to one political party?,’ said the spokesman.

The way the money is dished out is left to the discretion of the Co-op Group Board, but in previous years the vast bulk has gone to the Co-operative Party. 

The political donations pot was also the source of the £50,000 given to Ed Balls office by the Co-op group last year.

The Co-operative Party describes itself as Britain’s ‘fourth biggest political party’, although it only puts up candidates in partnership  with the Labour Party. 

Its politicians, who also number Stella Creasy, Stephen Twigg and Adrian Bailey, style themselves as ‘Co-operative  and Labour Party’ MPs.

Payouts to political groups  will be doubly controversial in the coming year as the Group battles to arrange a financial rescue for its struggling banking business, which  could cost investors, including private individuals, thousands  of pounds.

‘The comment about lunching with Miliband and Balls was made at his house in Bradford. There was another escort there and another man who he had picked up for the night from the Grindr [gay dating mobile phone] app. He loved an audience. 

‘He seemed serious about his politics. At one of our meetings at the Renaissance hotel, I remarked that perhaps Labour had gone for the wrong brother for the leadership.

He launched into a very forceful defence of Ed Miliband and promised me more than once that he would introduce me. He said I would change my mind if I met him.’

The escort said he was astonished by how unguarded Flowers was about his drug use. ‘He was either very naive or he just thought different rules applied to him.

Most people use code when referring to drugs in text messages or on the phone, but he didn’t seem to care. 

‘Often I would go to bed and he would stay up. When I got up, the next day he would say that he had just been taking coke all night. The day after we went to see Cabaret  at the Alhambra Theatre in Bradford, he had three lines of coke and then went to take charge of a funeral. It was totally inappropriate.’ 

A spokesman for the Co-op said he could not comment on claims that Flowers had used drugs to get through board meetings.

A Labour Party spokesman last night denied that Flowers enjoyed lunch with either Mr Miliband or Mr Balls: ‘This is not true. Ed Miliband has met Paul Flowers on only three occasions.

'They met in March this year and Flowers also attended, along with other business people, two informal dinners at which Ed Miliband was a guest. Ed Balls has been to a few events Flowers was also at but he has never had a meeting or a phone conversation with him.

‘Any attempt to suggest the behaviour of Flowers calls into question the integrity of the Labour Party as a whole is an unjustified smear. The Labour Party leadership has been  as shocked and appalled as anyone at the revelations regarding Flowers.

'That is why we took immediate action to suspend him from Labour within hours of the revelations.’
