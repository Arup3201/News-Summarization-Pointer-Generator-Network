January might be coming to an end but the nation's health kick is showing no signs of slowing down.

New research shows that Brits are still on a mission to lose weight and lead healthier lifestyles but they're embracing a new method - and it's good news for those who shudder at the thought of chugging a green juice.

New research by ao.com reveals that souping has become the go-to food trend so popular that sales of soup-maker blenders are overtaking the once-beloved juicer.

Juicing was big business in 2014 thanks to fans Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, right, but according to new research, 2015 is all about souping

Souping, which, according to nutritionists, reduces the high amount of saturated fats from dairy and meat products and offers nutrients, fibre and essential vitamins without all the sugar and salt of pre-packed soups, came from the US.

Clean-living preacher Gwyneth Paltrow included a different soup recipe in every day of her annual Goop detox. 

Recipes included a kabocha squash soup that she described as a 'warming winter soup' with 'a good kick of ginger, which helps stimulate digestion'.

She also includes red lentil soup, writing: 'This vegan soup is clean and bright from the cilantro and lime, but robust enough to keep you full between meals'.

Vegetable-based soups are designed to give  all the nutrition-packed benefits of a juice cleanse detox

The healthy mother and author also mentions blending a lot of leftover ingredients into soups for the health benefits.

Jennifer Aniston is also a big souping fan and favours a celery variety, made with onion, cauliflower and vegetable broth.

Companies like Soup Cleanse and Soupure offer cleanses they describe as a 'day-long regimen of vegetable-based soups, designed to give you all of the nutrition-packed benefits of a juice cleanse detox while sidestepping any glycaemic spike from the fruit in most juices - and with even fewer calories.'

Soups you sip on throughout the cleanse include kale, cauliflower and ginger, spinach and broccoli, beetroot and orange, and a cucumber, melon and mint dessert-style soup.

Speaking about the trend, Jo Travers BSc RD, an expert in nutrition and dietetics, said: 'Pre-packed soups are often loaded with salt or preservatives, or heated to very high temperatures, which can destroy some of the nutritional content, turning a healthy food into something much less so. 

'When you make soup yourself, you are in control of what goes in and what stays out.'

Madeleine Shaw, a nutritionist who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Soup is so nice this time of year, warming, nourishing and tasty.'

One of her favourite soup recipes is a beetroot and pumpkin dish packed with pumpkin, beetroots, cinnamon, coconut oil, onion, chicken stock and nutmeg. 

Speaking about the dish, she said: 'This  is easy to make and has the most amazing bright purple colour to it.

'It is abundant in the antioxidant beta-carotene thanks to the delicious pumpkin and gives us a healthy dose of folic acid from the beetroot. The cinnamon gives this dish that extra taste and also iron, calcium and manganese. It helps stabilize blood sugar levels too, which is great for weight loss.

'Just smelling cinnamon alone is said to boost cognitive function and memory, so give the soup a good whiff before you dig in.'

Neal's Yard Remedies, meanwhile, have unveiled a healing foods cookbook and includes soups packed with superfoods such as wheatgrass for an extra nutritional hit.

Susan Curtis, natural health director at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said: 'Soup is packed with nutrients. Even the simplest ingredients can be quickly transformed into easy to digest soups that stimulate, protect, detox and strengthen. 

'Vegetable based soups are an excellent source of soluble fibre, while soups with grains like barley and quinoa provide insoluble fibre, which are very helpful for healthy digestion. 

'Adding beans which are full of fibre and potassium, can help lower blood pressure whilst adding good slow releasing carbohydrates like brown rice, oats and root vegetables will keep you fuller for longer.'

Here are three healing soup recipes from the brand's cookbook, Neal's Yard Remedies Healing Foods, published by DK, £16.99, www.dk.com, nealsyardremedies.com 

Raw tomato soup 

Raw tomato soup is created to be cleansing

Comprising more than 90 per cent water and rich in antioxidants, tomatoes cleanse the liver, purify the blood, and are cooling and hydrating. They are useful in treating high blood pressure, accompanied by red eyes and headaches. The freshly juiced basil in this recipe enhances digestion, helps clear respiratory congestion and phlegm, and can lift the mood. 

Serves 4 

8 large ripe tomatoes 

2 tbsp basil 

8 celery sticks 

1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped 

2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped 

2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil salt and freshly ground black pepper 

1 Using a sharp knife, cut a light cross through the skin at the top of each tomato, then place the tomatoes in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let the water cool a little, then drain. Peel the skins off the tomatoes, cut into quarters, remove the seeds, dice the flesh, and place it in a blender or food processor. 

2 Remove the basil leaves from their stalks and reserve the leaves as a garnish. Juice the basil stalks with the celery sticks in a juicer and add the juice to the blender, along with the chilli and garlic. 

3 Blitz the ingredients until smooth. Add the olive oil, season to taste, and blitz once more. Pour the soup into 4 serving bowls. Garnish with the basil leaves, tearing them roughly with your fingers if they are large, or leaving them whole if they are small, and serve.

Wild garlic soup 

Wild garlic soup will boost the immune system

Sweet potato, wheatgrass, and wild garlic, all have anti-inflammatory and cleansing properties, so this is the perfect soup if you are feeling the cold or your immune system is sluggish after any winter bugs or illnesses. Wild garlic is only available in the spring, so if you want to make this soup at other times of the year, substitute it with a mixture of wild rocket and spinach. 

Serves 4 

1 tbsp sunflower oil 

4 medium shallots, chopped 

1 medium sweet potato (about 400g/14oz), peeled and chopped into small cubes 

700ml (11⁄4 pints) vegetable stock 

1 tbsp wheatgrass juice or 1 tsp wheatgrass powder (optional) 

4 tbsp crème fraîche or natural yogurt, to serve (optional) 

200g (7oz) young wild garlic leaves salt and freshly ground black pepper 

1 Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over a low heat, add the shallots and a little water, and allow the shallots to soften. Add the sweet potato and sauté for 5 minutes. Pour in the hot vegetable stock, bring to the boil, and simmer for about 15 minutes until the sweet potato softens. 

2 Meanwhile, if using the wheatgrass juice or powder, mix it with the crème fraîche or yogurt in a small bowl. 

3 Remove the pan from the heat, pour the mixture into a blender or food processor and blitz until smooth. Add the wild garlic leaves and blitz again until smooth. Season to taste. Pour the soup into 4 individual serving bowls, swirl a tablespoon of crème fraîche or yogurt into each portion, and serve. 

Butternut squash soup 

Butternut squash soup could help calm allergies

Squash has fibre, which benefits the stomach and digestive system. It’s a good choice if you suffer from allergies or food sensitivities, as it’s non-allergenic. Squash is also rich in beta-carotene to strengthen lungs, pancreas, and spleen. Combined with garlic, onions, and spices, this makes an immune-boosting meal. Both lemongrass and coconut milk add a mental and emotional uplift. 

Serves 6 

2 tbsp olive oil 

3 small onions, finely chopped 

1kg (2 1⁄4lb) butternut squash, deseeded and cut into small chunks 

1.5 litres (2 3⁄4 pints) vegetable stock 

4 kaffir lime leaves 

1 stalk lemongrass, bruised 

2 garlic cloves 

200ml (7fl oz) coconut milk zest and juice of 1 lime 

Salt and freshly ground black pepper and a few sprigs of coriander leaves, to garnish 

1 lime, cut into 6 wedges with a cut across the centre of each wedge, to serve 

1 Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions, and sauté over a low heat for 2–3 minutes until they are translucent. 

2 Add the squash and cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened at the edges. 

3 Add the stock, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, and garlic. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the squash is cooked through, but still retains some shape. 

4 Remove the kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass and discard. Add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the lime zest, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. 

5 Pour the soup into a food processor or blender, and blitz to a smooth consistency. Add some fresh lime juice to taste, pour into bowls, and garnish with the fresh coriander. 

6 Just before serving, fix a lime wedge to the rim of every bowl for each person to add a little extra lime juice, if they like. 

TIP: Keep the skin on the butternut squash to take advantage of the extra fibre, especially if it is a young one. Once cooked and blended the texture will become smooth.
