Lawsuit: John Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards a male massage therapist

John Travolta is being sued over accusations that he tried to have sex with a male a masseur during a therapy session at the luxury Beverly Hills Hotel.

The married actor, who has repeatedly denied being gay in the past, is said to have touched the unnamed therapist's genitals during a $200-per-hour massage appointment, the lawsuit claims.

The claim filed in court claims that Mr Travolta stripped naked - and appeared aroused - before being massaged while at the same time trying to remove the towel covering his bottom.

After the hour's session was over, the 58-year-old star is then alleged to have touched the man's scrotum and penis.

But the masseur insists he pulled away and claims he then informed the actor that he was a professional masseur and not a prostitute.

Mr Travolta, who has been married to Kelly Preston for 21 years, is then said to have responded that 'we must have got our signals crossed', before adding: 'Come on dude, I'll jerk you off.'

The star is then said to have suggested a 'reverse massage', which is believed to mean that he wanted the masseur to lie on the table while the actor gave the man a full body rub.

The lawsuit, filed at the U.S. District Court of Central California, claims Mr Travolta then masturbated.

During the alleged encounter Mr Travolta - who claims the accusation are 'fiction' - is also said to have told the man that Hollywood 'is controlled by homosexual Jewish men' who expect sexual favours in return for granting parts in films during the encounter in an annex of the five-star Beverly Hills Hotel.

The Grease star is alleged to have then claimed he had done things that 'would make most people throw up' during the apparent incident, said to have taken place on January 16.

G'Day LA event

Damning detail: This is the alleged interaction between the plaintiff and John Doe which forms the crux of the case

He allegedly claimed that he got his 
first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while 
starring in the 1975 TV series Welcome Back Kotter.

Whispers about John Travolta’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset.

Various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen the musical Hairspray – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay.

But there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image.

They include rumour that his 1991 marriage to Kelly Preston was arranged by the shadowy cult-like religion of Scientology, of which he is a leading disciple.

Seven years later, the father-of-two Travolta was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the Church. The case never got a hearing, however.

And in 2001, Travolta faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club.

However, the rumour mill reaches a crescendo in 2006, when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own Boeing 707 jet in Canada.

The plaintiff, or accuser - who refuses to be named because his
 lawyer claims he is frightened of the Hollywood powerhouse - alleges 
that Mr Travolta picked him up in his black Lexus SUV after a anonymous phone 
appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot 
in a nearby street.

During the journey, the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle,

After pulling up outside the Beverley
 Hills Hotel, they are then said to have entered one of the business's 
annexes opposite the main building, which are known as bungalows.

They were then greeted by an 
'overweight' black man who was grilling hamburgers. This chef is then 
said to have disappeared when Mr Travolta allegedly tried to have sex 
with the male masseur.

The masseur is seeking more than $2 million in damages.

A
 spokesperson for John issued a vehement denial, he said: 'This lawsuit 
is complete fiction and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the 
suit ever occurred.

'The plaintiff, who refuses to give 
their name, knows that the suit is a baseless lie…On that date when 
plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in California and it can be 
proved that he was on the East Coast.

'Plaintiff's attorney has filed this 
suit to try and get his 15 minutes of fame. John intends to get this 
case thrown out and then he will sue the attorney and Plaintiff for 
malicious prosecution.'

Okorie Okorcha, the lawyer representing the masseur told RadarOnline.com: 'My client is afraid of John Travolta.

'Fiction' A spokesperson for Travolta has hit out at the claims, even claiming that Travolta was not in LA at the time - though he was pictured at a G'Day LA event with his wife two days earlier

Witness:The plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage, which passed without incident

Serious allegations: Travolta is absolutely refuting that he was even in LA at the time of the alleged incident

Denial: Travolta, on the set of his latest film Savages in LA last year, will fight the case, according to his lawyer

He added: 'Mr. Travolta made very explicit threats against my client, which are contained in the lawsuit.

'Specifically, John Travolta told my client that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity.

'Let's face it, John Travolta is an extremely powerful man, and my client absolutely felt threatened by Mr. Travolta. My client was sexually assaulted by Mr. Travolta and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.'
