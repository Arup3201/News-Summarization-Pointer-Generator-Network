The battle of the instant messaging apps has taken a twist today after reports claim Facebook is working on a Snapchat rival.

The tech giant - which famously tried to buy Snapchat earlier this year - already has its own Messenger app, but rumours suggest it is planning to release a video-chat service, called Slingshot, later this month.

Like Snapchat, Slingshot would let users 
send short video messages by tapping the screen after selecting one or 
several contacts from their list of Facebook friends.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) is said to be preparing to take the site into a video-messaging war with rivals Snapchat and Vine. Rumours suggest the company has been working on a video-sharing app called Slingshot - and it might be released later this month

The move 
comes as both Vine and Snapchat have attempted to eat away at Facebook’s
 share of the messaging market with their Vine Messages and Chat updates
 respectively.

It’s no secret that some of the world’s biggest social networks are now locked in an instant messaging war.

A month ago Vine announced a messaging ability for its popular video-sharing service, dubbed Vine Messages.

And a few weeks ago Snapchat unveiled Chat, allowing users to send messages to each other on the app for the first time.

Facebook’s newest update would be a strike back at its rivals.

The rumours claim Mark Zuckerberg and his team have been working on the idea for several months, as Facebook attempts to separate various services out into different apps rather than combining them into one.

Back
in February, Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for 
$14.6 billion (£8.7 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion (£1.8 billion) bid to 
buy Snapchat.

At the start of April, Vine revealed its Vine Messages service that lets users send messages to each other.

This
directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get 
back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service.

At the start of May, Snapchat then unveiled 'Chat', a messaging service within the app that enabled users to send messages that, like photos and videos, are deleted after they're seen.

Facebook,
meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app,
with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native 
messaging client.

They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself.

And
even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are 
considering letting users have secret conversations on the site.

Talking to the Financial Times, sources said the app could be launched this month - although, as of yet there’s no official word from Facebook.

The move would follow Zuckerberg’s unsuccessful attempt to purchase Snapchat in late 2013 for $3 billion (£1.8 billion).

Instead, earlier this year Facebook bought WhatsApp for a whopping $14.6 billion (£8.7 billion) in cash and stock.

Despite the purchase, the move to provide users with simple ways to communicate is seen as a necessity as Facebook faces competition on all fronts.

Aside from the big-hitters a number of other apps like WeChat and Line are threatening to eat away at the Silicon Valley-based company.

Facebook acquired WhatsApp earlier this year for $14.6 billion (£8.7 billion) in cash and stock to complement its existing Facebook Messenger service. Further rumours suggest the company is planning to migrate all WhatsApp users onto Facebook Messenger

This isn’t the first time Facebook has made moves in these markets though.

Earlier this year they quietly removed two unpopular services on the iOS App Store – Poke and Facebook Camera.

The former, building on the once popular feature of its main website, was very similar to Snapchat and allowed users to send each other brief video messages.

The latter, meanwhile, was an attempt to rival Instagram and provide photographers with a means to applying filters to and editing their images.
