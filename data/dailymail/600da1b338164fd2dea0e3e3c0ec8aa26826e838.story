Danny Cipriani  demonstrated his enhanced defensive qualities in front of England coach Stuart Lancaster as Sale ambushed Wasps to claim a back-foot win in Salford on Sunday.

The Sharks moved up to eighth in the Aviva Premiership table, above the visitors on points difference, with this win founded on spirit and graft.

While Cipriani missed four kicks at goal — three penalties and a conversion — in blustery conditions, he ran the show with assurance for the hosts and tackled resolutely in the face of a Wasps onslaught.

He was certainly not alone in that regard, as Sale held their ground with committed resistance led by outstanding captain Dave Seymour.

‘We have spent a lot of time on our defence and we spent a lot of that game defending,’ said Cipriani. ‘It was a gutsy win and we’ll take confidence from that.’

With Lancaster in attendance, Cipriani was asked if Test selection was on his mind and added: ‘Everyone has thought about that. I’m happy with the way I’m going.

‘Defence is an area I’ve been working on a lot and I’m happy I’m stepping up in that area.’

His director of rugby, Steve Diamond, suggested the No 10’s defensive work has improved ‘beyond recognition’ and added: ‘He defended really well — he was putting people down then getting up and back into position.

‘He’s become a good player and he’s a good lad to coach.’

Sale went ahead through an early try by wing Tom Arscott, who was a livewire throughout, and although Nathan Hughes drove over at the other end, Chris Cusiter put the hosts back in charge when he scored after charging down a clearance by Charlie Davies.

Following a drop goal and penalty by Cipriani, Christian Wade wriggled through to touch down by the posts and put Wasps back in the hunt, but Tom Brady’s try three minutes from time settled the contest.

Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby, defended the absence of several frontline players for this game, saying: ‘Every change we made was a necessary change. We had enough ball to win that game three times over but we couldn’t do it.’

Meanwhile, Newcastle ended their 20-game losing run in the Premiership with an enthralling 29-24 victory over Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park.

Both sides scored three tries and had their chances to score a four-try bonus win in an end-to-end second half but, after Noah Cato’s 69th-minute score, the Falcons had the edge.

Director of rugby Dean Richards said: ‘I’m delighted for the boys the losing run is at an end.’
