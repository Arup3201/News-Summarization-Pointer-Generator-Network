Strung between the palm trees in the middle of Avenido Lusico Costa was a crude, home-made banner. Black spray paint on what appeared to be a white sheet. ‘Luisito — Uruguay te apoya,’ it read. ‘Little Luis — Uruguay supports you.’

And it does. The Uruguayan team arrived at their beachfront home in Barra de Tijuca, to the west of Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday night to a hero’s welcome. Little Luis may be the big villain of this World Cup in the eyes of many, but critical and ethical faculties have been suspended in  his homeland.

The fans that congregated around the team bus were unequivocal. ‘FIFA is corrupt,’ they chanted. ‘FIFA does not play football, but destroys it.’

On
 the Copacabana strip an adidas advert that shows Suarez, teeth bared 
like a ferocious animal, is attracting a line of pictorial comedians — 
posing circus-style with their heads in the lion’s mouth.

Yet, for Uruguay, the banishment of Suarez is a disgrace, not a comic caption on Facebook.

Arriving
 in Barra the captain, Diego Lugano, was taken almost immediately to the
 hotel’s gym, where he met that other noted arbiter of fair play, Diego 
Maradona. The pair enjoyed a long and  animated conversation, in 
Spanish, for the benefit of the television network covering Maradona’s 
trip. TeleSUR is a Venezuelan company based in Caracas. Do your own 
jokes, you know you want to.

The
 television screens high on the wall had Suarez’s clash with Giorgio 
Chiellini of Italy on an almost constant loop, interspersed with the 
most telegenic outrages of World Cups past. Horrific tackles, spitting 
at the referee, flying elbows and a torrent of red cards and redder 
mists were edited into a giant ball of malcontent.

Yet it all kept coming back to one man, now close to quarantined back home in Uruguay, considering his next move.

Maradona
 was flat on his back lifting weights when Lugano entered, but on 
sighting the captain he clambered to his feet to offer warm and 
effusive congratulations for sticking up for Suarez in public.

There
 was no doubt where Maradona also stood, having made his feelings plain
 by going on air to present his television show De Zurda — it means ‘The
 Lefty’ — wearing a T-shirt with the message ‘Luisito estamos con vos’ 
(‘Little Luis, we are with you’).

The
 pair began to talk for the TeleSUR cameras and it was clear this was 
going to be no rigorous inspection of moral standards and the boundaries
 of professional behaviour.

‘They
 treated him like a criminal,’ said Lugano. ‘Escorted out of our camp by
 the police. He did nothing. Why wouldn’t I defend him at that press 
conference? He’s such a great guy and this ban is very harsh.

‘It hits him at the very top of his level, at the best moment in his career. It is a very sad time for  Uruguay and for Luis.’

Lugano
 added that he hoped the team could grow stronger through adversity and 
with the support of the people. ‘I don’t understand it,’ Maradona told 
him. ‘The whole world was waiting to see Suarez at this World Cup. He 
had scored 31 goals in England last season.’

They then agreed that 
he had been banned only due to historical stuff. That this ancient 
history was two previous offences for the same crime seemed of little 
import.

‘This is the most important moment in Luis’s life,’ Lugano 
concluded. If he meant that he had to now choose one path, glory or 
infamy, therefore introducing the first tiny concession that behind this
 furore was a basically contemptible act that could never be repeated, 
he left the thought unsaid.

They parted with a hug of pure 
simpatico, as it is called in these parts; both victims, in their own 
minds at least, of terrible injustice.

It has not taken long for  
Maradona — still bitter over his expulsion from the 1994 World Cup for 
drug offences — to identify with Suarez, whom he sees as another 
renegade genius living beyond FIFA’s margins. Speaking earlier on his 
show, Maradona compared FIFA’s punishment to sending Suarez to 
Guantanamo Bay in handcuffs.

‘The FIFA sanction is shameful,’ he 
said. ‘It is a way of punishing Uruguayan clubs for asking the South 
American federation for a fairer share of money. It hurts that they have
 cut short the career of a lad who is a winner. It’s an excessive 
suspension and FIFA cannot talk about morals to anyone. ‘A player works hard the whole year to be able to play at the World Cup and they kick him out like this. It’s unbelievable.

‘Remember
 Zinedine Zidane and what he did in the 2006 World Cup final? FIFA then 
gave him the Golden Ball. In this World Cup there have been much greater
 incidents than Suarez’s. He didn’t kill anyone. This is an unjust 
punishment, the act of an incredible mafia.’

Maradona’s guest was 
Uruguayan president Jose Mujica, who had earlier made a wasted journey 
to Carrasco International Airport outside Montevideo, where Suarez was 
expected to return.

That the head of state should wish to welcome 
home a footballer ejected from the World Cup for biting an opponent 
affords some insight into the skewed Uruguayan mentality over this. 
Mujica looks like a much-loved grandpa and has modern, liberal, 
left-wing views on gay marriage, abortion and wealth distribution, but 
he knows how to work a crowd, too.

He gives 90 per cent of his 
salary to charity and has refused to move from a one-bedroom farmhouse 
to the palace that comes with his office. This makes him one of the most
 enlightened political leaders on any continent, but not immune to the 
odd act of pure populism.

The gathering at Carrasco Airport 
included fans  with banners and large cardboard cut-outs of Suarez’s  
face, some with false vampire teeth, celebrating an act that should  
provoke only revulsion. Mujica instinctively knew on which side his 
bread was buttered.

‘We feel that this is an assault on the poor,’ 
Mujica said. ‘This gang will not forgive Suarez because he never went to
 university, he isn’t educated, he grew up on the field, he is a natural
 rebel and expresses his anger naturally.

‘We have seen all the 
games and this is a different punishment. This is the most indignant 
punishment. Here they add everything together but the boy really 
shouldn’t be blamed. It’s a match and these things happen. There’s no 
need to look into every incident, because if we did that in each game 
we’d play five-a-side.’

Of course, there are plenty of working-class 
people in Latin America who go through a considerably more impoverished 
life than Suarez is experiencing without biting anybody, but Uruguay is 
in no mood for logic or social realism right now.

They are the 
victims here, the tiny nation of three million — ‘tres miliones de 
ilusiones… vamos  Uruguay!’ it says on the team bus, which translates as
 ‘Three million dreams … let’s go Uruguay’ —  that has been conspired 
against by the superpowers of England, Italy and FIFA.

Do they have a
 point? Not really. There is no way FIFA could look at this incident in 
isolation, considering the recidivism in Suarez’s behaviour, meaning 
wider comparisons are inappropriate.

Yet they are being made, 
constantly. One debate concerns the case of Josip Simunic of Croatia, 
banned for 10 international games — but not from all football — for 
using the Nazi inspired ‘Za dom spremni!’ chant after Croatia’s win over
 Iceland.

‘Not as bad as Suarez?’ it was asked on Brazilian 
television. Yet equivalency can be used to pick holes in any 
sanction: certainly when, to the banner-wavers, the apologists and 
Suarez simpaticos, the only correct punishment is no punishment at all.
