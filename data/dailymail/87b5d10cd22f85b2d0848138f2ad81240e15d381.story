President Hamid Karzai said Afghanistan would have been better off without NATO troops

Afghanistan's president angered the families of British soldiers yesterday by suggesting the presence of Nato troops over the past 13 years had made his country worse.

The US-led invasion in 2001, a response to the September 11 attacks, was launched to drive out Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

But describing the Taliban as 'brothers' and America as 'rivals', Afghan leader Hamid Karzai said: 'The mission, in terms of bringing security, has not been successful, particularly in Helmand.

'What they did was create pockets of wealth and a vast countryside of deprivation and anger.'

Asked by The Sunday Times whether it would have been better if British troops – many of whom are based in Helmand province – had never gone there, Karzai replied: 'I guess so. Yes.'

His remarks were labelled an insult by relatives of some of the 447 British soldiers who have lost their lives there.

Joan Humphreys, whose 24-year-old grandson Kevin Elliot, a Black Watch infantryman, was killed in Afghanistan in 2009, said: 'He has been hinting at this for a while but never said anything this blatant. I find his comments vile.'

Britain's commander in Afghanistan, Lieutenant General John Lorimer, disputed Karzai's claims. He said: 'Amazing things have been achieved here.'

British troops are due to be withdrawn later this year.

Elaine Bell, whose son Private Martin Bell won the George Medal after being killed trying to save a colleague from the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, told the Mail: ‘The president is entitled to his opinion but those lads and girls do a fantastic job out there. I can see why a lot of people will be infuriated by his comments.’

She added: ‘All we hear about are the deaths and horror stories but our soldiers are out there building schools. They have also been out there trying to close down terrorist training grounds and if they were not to keep a lid on it, we wouldn’t be able to sleep so soundly.’

The president was also accused by other relatives of ‘spitting on the graves’ of British soldiers.

Jacqui Janes, from Brighton, the mother of 20 year-old Guardsman Jamie Janes, who was killed by an IED in 2009, said: ‘His government’s corrupt and he’s a proper turncoat.

'I don’t know what he hopes to gain from saying this. It’s wrong and it’s disgusting.

‘He may as well as have just come and spat on our sons’ graves. It’s such an insult to everyone who lost their lives.’

Carol Valentine, whose son, Sergeant Simon Valentine, 29, died from injuries after an explosion while on foot patrol near Sangin, northern Helmand, in 2009, said: ‘He makes some very rash, weird statements and in the next breath he wants to come over and shake people’s hands.

'So many families are now suffering because of the support that this country gave to Afghanistan.’

Britain’s most senior commander in Afghanistan, Lieutenant-General John Lorimer, disputed that Afghanistan had been left in a worse state because of Nato involvement : ‘I don’t agree,’ he said.

The involvement of international troops meant al-Qaeda had been denied a safe haven in Afghanstan and that local security forces had developed into a ‘pretty impressive’ force.

He added: ‘Amazing things have been achieved here, if you go look at governance across country it has improved at province and district level.’

David Cameron provoked controversy when he recently suggested that the mission had been accomplished in Afghanistan.

Britain plans to withdraw its troops from the country this year, after 13 years of involvement in the country.

Mr Karzai is refusing to sign an agreement to allow American and other Nato soldiers to stay on until after this year to train Afghan forces.

He is understood to want to leave it to his successor to decide, who is due to be elected in the April presidential elections.
