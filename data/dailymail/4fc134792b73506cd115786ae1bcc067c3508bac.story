Doctors are to face compulsory checks on their medical skills to ensure they are not putting patients in danger.

From December, all GPs and hospital medics will have to start submitting dossiers of evidence proving their competence.

If they are not deemed to be up to scratch, they could be referred to the General Medical Council and even struck-off.

MoTs: Doctors will now have compulsory checks to make sure their medical skills are up to scratch

The checks were partly triggered by the inquiry into Harold Shipman, the Manchester GP who murdered up to 250 patients between 1972 and 1998.

They were meant to be rolled-out several years ago but have been repeatedly delayed because the system wasn’t deemed ready.

Presently doctors can go through their entire 40-year career without ever having to prove they are still competent and there are concerns patients may be at risk.

Under the new system doctors will face such checks every five years.

They will have to submit a file proving their medical skills to one of the chief doctors at the hospital or NHS organisation where they work - known as the ‘responsible officer’.

This will include feedback from their colleagues, comments from patients and a list of courses they have attended to keep skills up to date.

Doctors will either be passed, be told to go away and carry out more training or failed -which is officially termed ‘not to be engaging.’

Such doctors would then be referred to the General Medical Council and possibly struck-off - although this only expected to happen on rare occasions.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We want to have the best survival rates in Europe for the major killer diseases.

‘Doctors save lives every day and making sure they are up to speed with the latest treatments and technologies will help them save even more. This is why a proper system of revalidation is so important.’

The checks were in-part prompted by the scandal at the Bristol Royal Infirmary hospital, where up to a 100 babies died following heart surgery.

Doctors at the unit were accused of being ‘closed, secretive and defensive.’

Then in 2004, the inquiry into Harold Shipman called for doctors to face regular checks - it said the General Medical Council was not doing enough to protect patients.Professor Sir Peter Rubin, chair of the GMC said: ‘This is an historic day for patients and for the medical profession.

We are confident that the introduction of revalidation will make a major contribution to the quality of care that patients receive and will give them valuable assurance that the doctors who treat them are regularly assessed against our professional standards.’

The health secretary also announced plans for a national list of GPs and dentists to root-out poor performers.

At present there are only local registers meaning that if a doctor receives a high number of complaints in one area - and is removed from the list - they can just move to another and start afresh.

But the British Medical Association warned that the checks may just lead to even more bureaucracy in the NHS.

Dr Mark Porter, chair of the BMA’s Council said: ‘It is important to recognise, that while revalidation will undoubtedly enhance the rigorous testing that doctors undergo, clinicians are already offering patients a very high quality service and robust systems are currently in place to deal with any concerns.

‘There is too much bureaucracy in the NHS and so we have to be careful that revalidation does not add to this unnecessarily.’
