Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh has been sued by a FedEx delivery man for $2.9million after he slipped on a wet floor.

Mackintosh’s personal cleaner had mopped the floor outside of his Manhattan office.

The producer of Cats, Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables did not believe that the cleaning service provided by the building was good enough.

He had his cleaner Esme David tidy up the Broadway office twice a week and his apartment three times, reported the New York Daily News.

The FedEx delivery man slipped on the floor at 9.30am on November 13 2008.

He was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was told he tore his rotator cuff muscles in his shoulder, ruptured tendons in his thighs and torn cartilage in his knee.

The delivery man, who also had neck and back injuries, was disabled and told he could not work again.

His lawyer, Scott Rynecki said: ‘For someone who produced elaborate Broadway shows, he didn’t do such a good job managing his personnel.

‘There are obvious dangers with mopping the floor at the same time people are arriving for work.’

Mackintosh, 54, was not there at the time of the accident, and was not questioned under oath.

Staff at the office said that the arrangement was unusual, as Ms David only cleaned Mackintosh’s part.

Mackintosh, who was knighted in 1996, has produced musicals in New york and London, including My fair Lady (pictured)

Office manager Jennifer O’Connor said: ‘It is my understanding that because we care about the look of our office and our high-profile clientele that (Esme David) was hired to come in and do supplemental cleaning . . . because what was done by the building was not sufficient.’

The settlement was negotiated last week after a jury was selected at Brooklyn Supreme Court.

The claimant asked not to be identified as he lives in an area of high crime and was worried it would risk his safety.
