A huge security operation is underway today ahead of the clandestine Bilderberg conference starting at a five-star hotel in Hertfordshire tomorrow.

Anti-capitalists are planning to descend on the secret annual meeting of the world's leading politicians, bankers, academics and business minds.

It is being held at the exclusive Grove Hotel near Watford, which is now surrounded by a giant fence being guarded by police.

Famous for being shrouded in secrecy, the Bilderberg conference is taking place in Britain for the first time since 1998, and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination.

Luxurious: The secretive conference will take place at the five-star Grove Hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire (pictured) and a major police security operation has started today, which includes adding fencing

Preparations: Police were seen  doing security checks in bushes outside the hotel and checking the perimeter

Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour counterpart Ed Balls will be there along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt of Google.

But delegates never reveal exactly what is discussed, but it will involve the key issues these leaders believe the world faces. 

There is already a heavy police presence
 in the area because of the fears that the three-day meeting may be 
disrupted by anti-Globilisation protesters.

Extra fencing was erected in
 the grounds and footpaths were being closed.

The Grove Hotel, which is set in 300 acres or parkland, is close to the M25, the River Gade and the Grand Union Canal.

Guest list: Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour shadow Ed Balls will attend the Bilderberg Conference

Delegates will be spending three days
 with the heads of global corporations such as Google, Amazon, Goldman 
Sachs and BAE Systems as well as other leading figures such as Christine
 Lagarde, head of the IMF, and former US secretary of state, Henry 
Kissinger.

They are among the 
140 people, including only 14 women - 
who will this week discuss topics such as ‘cyber warfare’ and ‘jobs, 
entitlement and debt’.

Dorothy Thornhill, the Mayor of 
Watford has written to the Prime Minister voicing concern about cost of 
the security operation will have on Hertfordshire's police budget

Hertfordshire Police said the 
Bilderberg Group had made a donation to the policing costs of the 
conference, but would not say how much.

Given the amount of prestigious names 
set to attend the event at the luxury hotel, local police have been 
forced to step up security, which will be part-funded by the government.

As a result, there are fears that anti-capitalist protesters will cause ‘violence and disturbance’.

Bilderberg - which will also be 
attended by former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius - has a shadowy 
reputation which has come under scrutiny in recent years, forcing 
organisers to be more open.

A
 Bilderberg spokesman said in a press release on Monday: ‘The conference
 has always been a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about 
megatrends and the major issues facing the world.

‘Thanks
 to the private nature of the conference, the participants are not bound
 by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they 
can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights.’

Policing resources in Watford have been stretched to accommodate the elite guests that will arrive tomorrow. Protest are expected to break out

The
 conference was founded in 1954 as an annual event designed to foster 
dialogue between Europe and North America. Between 120 and 150 people 
take part each year.

They will also debate subjects including
 ‘can the U.S. and Europe grow faster and create jobs’, ‘how big data is
 changing almost everything’, ‘U.S. foreign policy’ and ‘Africa’s 
challenges’.

The cloak of secrecy surrounding the meetings bans journalists from attending.

Bilderberg follower Charlie Skelton said today he believes this year's conference to attract more attention than ever.

He also described how at the 2009 meeting in Greece he was 'being chased around Athens by the Greek secret police'.

Speaking to the International Business
 Times he said: 'I'm expecting quite a large number of people to be 
coming along to Watford to see it'.

Google has come under fire in recent weeks over reports that it paid just £10million in corporation tax in Britain between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9billion.

Amazon said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year - but told investors it in fact turned over 13 times that amount, with British sales of more than £4billion.
