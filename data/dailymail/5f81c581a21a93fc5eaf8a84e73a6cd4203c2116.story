Grieving parents have revealed how their miscarriages and stillbirths have been handled insensitively and callously by the NHS.

Many were horrified to be told that the remains of their dead babies would be incinerated with other medical waste.

Cathryn Hurley, 35, whose first pregnancy 
failed when she was 13 weeks along, was one of the victims.

Insensitive: Cathryn Hurley was told her miscarried baby would be disposed of with the rest of the day's waste, left, while Samantha Allington's, right, baby's remains were whisked off and incinerated before she was consulted

She said: 'We went for routine scan and I was really 
excited. But I was told "I'm really sorry your baby's heart stopped beating 
when you were eight weeks pregnant."

'Unbeknown to me I'd had a dead baby inside me for
five weeks. I was hysterical and crying. A nurse talked us through our 
options which was to let things happen naturally at home or have what's called a 
"medical management of miscarriage."

Cathryn said they opted for the latter but their ordeal was compounded by how they were then treated.'I
 asked one of the nurses what would happen to my baby and she said "it 
will be incinerated with the rest of the day's waste."' she recalled.

'That was 
difficult to hear, to me it wasn't the day's waste, it was my baby. It 
would have been nice to mark that baby's life but there was nothing in 
the hospital that gave us that opportunity.'

Cathryn, who went on to have a healthy son, shares her story with Amanda Holden for tonight's edition of Dispatches on Channel 4.Â 

Ordeal: Grieving mothers share their stories with Amanda Holden on this evening's Dispatches

The Britain's Got Talent judge has suffered from numerous heartache herself in her quest to be a mother.

She now has daughters Lexi and Holly with husband Chris. But in 2010 she had a miscarriage and in 2011, she had a stillborn son. Then when she gave birth to her second daughter, she nearly died after her heart stopped beating but was resuscitated by a midwife.

Amanda said she received "amazing" treatment and support from the NHS so she was shocked to hear of the suffering of other parents.

Samantha Allington revealed how she was mistreated when she was rushed hospital in pain when seven weeks pregnant.

She explained: 'I had to do urine sample and the baby passed when I went to the toilet. A nurse came and grabbed the pot and ran off with it.

'I was distressed wondering what she had done with my baby. I was then told it had been incinerated. I felt like my baby had been stolen from me, I had no rights over what happened.'

Loss: Katy Quillan buried her stillborn son David at Duke Street cemetery Southport

Misled: When Katy buried her son she thought this plot on the right would be his indefinitely

However, she returned find his grave had been dismantled and there was another baby in the same plot

Incineration of fetal remains is banned in Scotland but there are only guidelines for rest of UK stating remains should be handled 'sensitively'.

Dispatches discovered that 27 trusts incinerate remains, sometimes with the parents oblivious to the fact their babies are being disposed of along with other medical waste such as syringes and swabs.

One hospital, Addenbrooke, in Cambridge is even heated by burning clinical waste including miscarried babies.

Angela Whitton, from the Royal College of Nursing: 'That's appalling, it should not take place in this day and age. Hopefully we will ban incineration of fetal remains in the near future.'

As reported earlier in the Daily Mail, last night health minister Dan Poulter stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating fetal remains head of the documentary airing this evening.

Amanda praised her own experience of the NHS but was shocked to hear others had been less fortunate

'This practice is totally unacceptable,' he said. 'That is why I have asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, to write to all NHS hospital trusts, to make it clear that it must stop now.

'The Chief Medical Officer has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue.

'While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.'

Dispatches also reveals that other parents have suffered due to the way burials of their deceased babies have been handled.

Katy Quillan buried her stillborn son David at Duke Street cemetery Southport.

She said she discussed plans with her local hospital trust and funeral directors and then created a memorial where her son was buried with a small fence, stones and flowers.

She later returned to find it been dismantled and was horrified to find a new baby's grave in its place.

Both she and the parents of that baby were devastated to think their baby did not have a grave of their own or any lasting memorial.

When they complained, they were told the procedure had been explained previously but they probably weren't in the the "right frame of mind" to take it in.

But Katy said: 'I would have remembered if they've told me six other babies would be buried with mine.'

The NHS trust involved blamed the funeral directors and council who operate the cemetery for not fully explaining the situation to the bereaved parents.

Hunters Funeral Directors, who handed the burial, said all babies are buried individually in their own plots but permanent plots are not permitted in baby section. They added: 'We are truly sorry if this was not explained clearly enough, and we are working to improve information.'

Sefton Council who operate the cemetery added: 'Items were removed from her baby's grave to facilitate the burial of another baby in the adjacent space. This is normal practice and all the items were neatly left in a bag by the grave.'
