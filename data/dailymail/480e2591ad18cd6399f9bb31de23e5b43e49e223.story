Brendan Rodgers declared Mario Balotelli must improve after a disappointing week compounded by defeat at Basle.

The £16million striker was seen as something of a coup for the Reds in the summer, but a lack of goals and perceived snub of the club’s supporters on Wednesday night have raised question marks over the Italian’s suitability at Anfield.

Balotelli struggled in Switzerland on Wednesday, with Rodgers all too aware.

‘In terms of his behaviour the boy is trying to work hard in then game that we demand,’ the manager said.

‘In terms of goals, he needs to improve. There is no question about that. He has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.

‘We need to return to being a team. When confidence is low, it can become about the individual but we have to get back to being a team.

‘I encourage the strikers to get into the framework of the goal. I think our quality wasn't what it should be in the final third. We win and lose as a team and last night we were not good enough.’
