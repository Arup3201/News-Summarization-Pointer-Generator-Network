It is the perfect video for the armchair traveller - a snapshot of South East Asia in just four minutes.

American Josh Rapperport mounted a hands-fee camera on his motorbike as he raced around some of the beautiful and most perilous tracks in the world and turned the footage into a beautiful travel video.

The adventurer visited countries including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar, capturing amazing scenery and friendly locals.

The Harvard University student used the camera when dismounted from his motorbike to record some incredible and fascinating scenes

From dirt tracks, to mountain roads to bridges, it was certainly some adventure for Rapperport

The tourist had to wait at this 'elephant crossing' as the giant animal made its way past with a couple of tourists on board

Taking in crystal blue waters, mountain-winding dirt tracks and numerous stop-offs taking in the local cultures, his adventure can now be shared by us all.

Locals are filmed moving to the side as Rapperport speeds on by, with many of the routes perched perilously on the sides of mountains.

A stop off in Thailand is filmed; tourists are shown leaping through a burning ring of fire and onto the sand at one of the world famous Full Moon parties.

Rapperport then takes some time out to relax from his motorcycle trek.

The camera is taken to the beach, into rock-pools and then on the back of a kayak at one serene location on his adventure.

Cruising down the Mekong Delta, riding on elephants, and then an unfortunate collision with a moped are documented beautifully.

Hopefully not drink driving?! Rapperport takes a break from his epic trek to have a cold beverage

Rapperport was on hand to catch the antics of Thai locals as well as fellow tourists as they dived through the ring of fire

The student was on hand to join in New Year's celebrations during his time travelling in Asia

Rapperport takes us through a whole host of customs and traditions throughout his journey, from visiting Buddhist temples, a stop off at Angkor Wat, to cattle-herding and New Year's celebrations. 

The Harvard University student said: 'I took a year away from school to do some adventuring, ending up with a journey of a lifetime, riding 3,000 miles across Southeast Asia, mostly alone, via motorbike.

'The journey took almost three months, and the experiences are something I will never forget.

'This journey took place across 3,000 miles in Southeast Asia. 

The views as the American traversed on the dirt roads are something he will remember forever

Rapperport's friend Logan joined him for three weeks on the trip where the pair chilled out on the beaches

There was time for Rapperport to dismount the camera and film himself enjoying the crystal blue waters

'I rode over every variety of road and environment - through villages that rarely, if ever, had a traveler come through. 

'(It) was a wild and enlightening experience of adventure, culture and solitude. I rode alone for almost the entire three months. My good friend Logan joined me for three weeks.'
