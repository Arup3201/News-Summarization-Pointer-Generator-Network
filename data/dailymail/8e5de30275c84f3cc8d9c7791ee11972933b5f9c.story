The New York City cop who killed an unarmed man last week knew he was in trouble just seconds after the fatal shooting.

Officer Peter Liang told his partner Shaun Landau, 'I think I'm going to get fired,' moments after he 'accidentally' fired his gun on Thursday evening at the Louis Pink Houses in the East New York section of Brooklyn, and before he was aware of the fact that he had even struck someone with a bullet.

That victim, 28-year-old Akai Gurley, was pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital shortly after the shooting and his death has been ruled a homicide.

According to an internal police report obtained by the New York Post, Liang entered the darkened eighth floor stairwell landing with his gun drawn and a flashlight in his hands Thursday evening during a routine patrol.

The report then states, 'Almost instantly, Officer Liang discharged his service weapon one time directly outward.'

That bullet traveled down approximately 12 feet, striking Gurley in the chest.

Liang and Landau, both rookies, then ran down the stairwell, eventually coming across Gurley's girlfriend, Melissa Butler, sobbing over his body.

The four did not exchange any words, and Liang called for an ambulance.

Butler then ran to a neighbor's apartment to call 911, saying she 'feared for her life.'

Lt. Vitaliy Zelikov, who arrived on the scene in the aftermath, said Liang was 'visibly upset, shaken up and clearly very distraught.'

Justice: Now, the Brooklyn district attorney's office is launching an investigation into the shooting as friends and family mourn Gurley's death (above)

On Monday, Butler met with Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson who is investigating the shooting.

Thompson also met with community leaders on Sunday, this after more than 250 people marched in protest outside Liang's 75th Precinct on Saturday while holding up signs calling for justice.

The Internal Affairs Bureau of the NYPD has also launched an investigation into the shooting of Gurley, Commissioner Bill Bratton called a 'total innocent.'

Gurley, who has been described as a 'peacemaker,' was the father to a two-year-old daughter, Akaila.
