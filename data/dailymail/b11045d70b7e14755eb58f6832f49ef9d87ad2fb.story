Residents of a quiet Mayfield, New York, cul-de-sac are worried their neighbor's home is bringing down property values - but not for the usual reasons.

Steve Salton, 63, keeps three tigers and two leopards in an 'escape-proof' enclosure in his backyard.

And the families next door don't want the big - and potentially dangerous - cats living 500 feet from their homes for both their own safety, but also because they're scaring off prospective buyers.

According to The Times Union, one 3,500-square-foot home in the cul-de-sac was listed for more than $400,000 but it has remained vacant with no buyers for years.

The City of Mayfield is now moving to get the animals evicted from the property after a barrage of complaints.

Richard Travis moved to the area in 2006 and has for years been fighting for the cats to be removed, saying his friends won't visit him because they're so frightened.

'I bought what I think is a beautiful house,' Travis told the newspaper.

'And I'm on a street where there should be other homes of this character. But there can't be because of what is there.'

He added: 'Would you live here?'

It's not against the law in Mayfield to keep exotic pets but officials are trying to get rid of Salton's cats by deeming his operation a business and they have denied his request for a business permit, ruling that such a business isn't appropriate for a residential area.

Law suit: Salton is being sued by a property developer who says the animals are preventing home sales

That decision was upheld by a state supreme court but Salton is now appealing it, according to The Times Union.

He is also being sued by a local property develop who claims the animals are preventing home sales in the area.

Salton claims keeping the cats, which he began collecting in 2007, is a '24-7 job.'

The animals are endangered species and are allowed to roam freely within an animal enclosure in Salton's backyard though they are sometimes kept in cages.

'I made a commitment, and I won't back away from it,' Salton said of caring for the exotic pets. 'My mission is to give them a home.'
