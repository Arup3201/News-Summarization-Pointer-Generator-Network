Clearly deep in thought, David Cameron watched judo at the Olympics yesterday with a master of the sport, Vladimir Putin.

The Russian president arrived in London under 
the guise of diplomacy, heading first to Downing Street to discuss the crisis in Syria.

The heads of state met 
for about 45 minutes before heading out to the ExCel arena in Greenwich, 
taking second-row seats just after the 78kg women's semi-finals.

Putin
spent time appearing to educate Cameron on the finer points of judo - 
after all, Putin is a black belt, serves as the honorary president of 
the International Judo Federation and even wrote a book about the sport 
called Judo: History, Theory, Practice.

Vladimir Putin and David Cameron seemed deep in concentration as they watched the Olympic judo yesterday

With a translator between them, Putin would lean in toward Cameron, talk a bit and 
make a few gestures with his hands, the Prime Minister mostly nodding.

Putin clenched his fists at times, leaned back nervously at others. And when his compatriots won Olympic gold, he leaped from his seat and thrust his arms skyward.

The longtime judo enthusiast had a VIP seat to watch Tagir Khaibulaev win the 100kg gold medal.

When the match ended, Putin led the celebration. He slipped back into his suit jacket, met Khaibulaev moments after he walked off the mat, wrapped him in a warm embrace, and tousled his hair.

Cameron did not have the same luck. Britain had a finalist in the 78kg women's event - but Gemma Gibbons lost to American Kayla Harrison, the first judo gold for the U.S.

Earlier that day, the Prime Minister had tried to push the ex-KGB spy into stepping up pressure on President Bashar al-Assad and stop blocking Western-backed resolutions.

Before the judo, David Cameron warmly greeted the Russian president on the steps of Downing Street

But by the end of their talks, for 
which Putin put in an unusually punctual appearance, the leaders said 
Russia and Britain still differed over Syria.

Mr Putin was also meant to appear at a joint press conference at Downing Street but was allowed to pull out.

Reporters had been desperate to ask him 
about the 2006 murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko who was 
poisoned with radioactive material.

Since
the killing Russia has refused British extradition requests to take the
chief suspect in the case, ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi, to the UK for 
questioning.

The attempt at warmer relations disappointed Mr Litvinenko’s widow, 
Marina, who said she was 'dismayed' by the visit.

Sensitive: It is the Russian leader's first visit to Britain in seven years

In an attempt to improve Britain's edgy relationship with the Russians, David Cameron shielded Mr Putin from difficult questions

Goodbye: Putin waves to the Press as he leaves Downing Street

'To show that Mr Putin
is not welcome here, I urge my fellow Londoners to put on a white 
ribbon, the symbol of Russian protest, on the day Mr Putin arrives,' she
said.

Mr Putin was also able to avoid 
questions from about a group of leading musicians who have called for 
for a fair hearing to be given to members of a punk band facing prison 
for performing what they say was a 'legitimate protest'.

The
trio Pussy Riot face up to seven years behind bars after staging a 
performance in a Moscow cathedral calling on the Virgin Mary to remove 
President Putin from power.

Jarvis Cocker, Pete Townshend, Martha
Wainwright and Neil Tennant were among those who raised concerns about 
the 'preposterous' charge in a letter to The Times.

Meanwhile, just a day after the gaffe-prone Boris 
Johnson got himself stuck on a zip-wire, he decided to do his bit
for British-Russian relations, with similarly embarrassing results.

As the two countries prepared for their delicate talks, the Mayor of London 
instead challenged Russian leader Vladimir Putin to 'strip to the waist'
and take part in the judo contest.

Familiar with Putin's passion for the sport, Johnson joked that the Russian president might join in the judo when he visited the Olympic Park.

'I hope he will take part - isn’t he a dab hand?'  the Mayor said.

'I think that’s what people want to see - stripped to the waist.

'We want the politicians’ Olympics, that’s what we want.'

After the key talks, Mr Cameron said 
thank you to some of the troops providing security for the Olympic Games
by serving them chocolate brownies and tea.

Thanks a bunch: Prime Minister David Cameron then went off to hand out brownies to soldiers helping with the Olympic Games

Tea time: Soldiers of 5th Battalion The Rifles, normally stationed in Germany, are giving up their time off to guard London 2012

The soldiers, mostly infantrymen from 5th
Battalion the Rifles based at Paderborn in Germany, were guarding the 
St James’s Park entrance to Downing Street, alongside the Olympic beach 
volleyball arena on Horse Guards Parade.

Members of 5 Rifles were called in to fill gaps left by private security firm G4S weeks after the battalion came back from a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Some of them told the Prime Minister that their leave had been cancelled so they could take part in Olympic duties, and Mr Cameron told them he was sure that they would get the leave back later.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister is obviously aware of the great job the soldiers are doing all around London to deliver a safe and secure Games and he wanted to go out and thank the soldiers working at the back of No 10.'
