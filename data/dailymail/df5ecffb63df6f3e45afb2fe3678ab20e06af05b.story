It's the hairstyle that was once reserved for punks and male models but with a little help from the glossiest and most fashion-forward A-listers, the undercut is fast becoming the hairstyle du jour.

Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus, who are known for their experimental styles, were the first celebrities to rock the shaved hairstyle and now even play-it-safe Jessica Alba and Jennifer Aniston are showcasing what at last looks like newly-shorn hair.

Last week's Comic-Con International, a comic convention held annually in San Diego, was case in point. Co-stars Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson wore matchy-matchy undercuts for the Sin City panel and Natalie Dormer loved the look so much, she wore it for three days in a row.

There are several takes on the new style but whether you literally shave one side of your head like Rosario or create an illusion of the look with a cornrow a la Jessica, you'll be bang on trend this season and next.

The likes of Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner have embraced a more pared-back and elegant take on the style and the usually grungy  Kristin Stewart even wore the look in her Chanel campaign.

But this 
isn't the first time we've seen the look. In fact, it's a catwalk style 
that was trialled at Fashion Week in February that has since filtered 
down to the red-carpet slowly but surely ever since.

The rebellious style, which is expected
 to play an even bigger part in London Fashion Week in September, was spotted at shows by
 Alexander McQueen, Simone Rocha and Marchesa; the Vogue beauty team have even featured a how-to in their latest issue.

But how do you take a tricky catwalk trend and pull the look off at home?

Steve Carr, Senior Stylist at Jo Hansford, said: 'When
 deciding between the undercut or the faux undercut, you need to consider 
your lifestyle and if it’s something you need to hide for work. If so, 
the faux option is the best choice.

'You can 
only hide a real undercut if you have long thick hair. If you have a low
 parting, opt for that side. If you have a centre parting, you can use 
whichever side you feel most comfortable with.

'If you 
are going to be bold and pick the real option, you have to go really, 
really short - you definitely don’t want to have any fuzz! You need to 
have it re-shaved regularly. Your stylist will be able to help you with 
placement as the distance that you go back will depend on your crown.

'If 
plaiting instead, decide on the number of plaits you need. They need to look 
neat to get the best results so you may need to ask a friend or 
professional for help. If you are doing yourself - you will get the 
tidiest results with an inverted French plait.

'Start by using a hair oil to tame any flyaways - Jo Hansford Illuminoil is perfect for this. Undercuts work best on short, messy looks - for example Miley Cyrus, or long textured styles like Alice Dellal.

'It doesn’t work so well on mid-length or fine hair, and you need to style the hair that you leave loose with texture or movement.'

Cornrows date back to the Stone Age and were used to portray status, age, religion and ethnicity.

Fast 
forward to the Sixties and plaits were used as a political statement 
with many African Americans embracing their cultural roots, and now, it seems, they're a serious style statement.

According to style and brand expert Nick Ede, the cornrow is here to stay - and it's all Cara Delevingne's fault.

He said: 
'Cornrows are a big trend right now that’s polarising the fashion elite!
 The Cara Effect will encourage festival goers and Ibiza trendies to 
embrace the trend in different ways but it will be particularly 
interesting to see how it trickles down to the high street.

'I think 
we’ll see people trying both loose and tight styles, what will make this
 interesting will be seeing if they can rock it like Cara.'

Gary Evans, Director of Taylor Taylor London, shares a foolproof guide to getting the look.
