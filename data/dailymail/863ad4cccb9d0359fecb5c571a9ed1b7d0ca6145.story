A Brooklyn high school teacher escaped jail yesterday after she pleaded guilty to having sex with a 16-year-old student.

Erin Sayar, 37, lost her teaching license over the scandal as well as her marriage after her husband filed divorce papers in January and moved out of their Park Slope apartment.

Heavily-tattooed Sayar was an English teacher at James Madison High School.

When the judge asked her yesterday if she had sex with teenager Kevin Eng she said yes.

Married mother: Erin Sayar, 37, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse

Marriage over:  Erin Sayar, left, is being divorced by husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, in the aftermath of last year's scandal that she repeatedly slept with a student

'They stated to me that they don’t want to see the defendant spend time 
in jail,' Assistant District Attorney Serena Horowitz said, implying 
that Eng no longer has hard feelings toward Sayar.

'The complainant and his family are amenable to the offer,' the New York Post reports.

Sayar was arrested last May and charged with 50 counts of statutory rape and sexual abuse.

Authorities said that the 37-year-old
had both oral sex and intercourse with the teen at least eight times in
her SUV and in her office at the school.

She is also said to have plied the teen with marijuana which she keeps hidden in her filing cabinet. The mother-of-one was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office
while his teammates were using the weight room next door.

The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November.

Allegations: She pleaded guilty to having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School

Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (center) as she left court last June with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her

Consequences: Sayer has been placed on 10-years probation and may have to sign as a sex offender for the rest of her life

After hacking Eng's Facebook account,
the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so
much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'.

Sayar replied: 'Oh no - I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.'

Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations.

Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend.

The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day.

One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car.

'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body.

The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals.

Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied.

Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.
