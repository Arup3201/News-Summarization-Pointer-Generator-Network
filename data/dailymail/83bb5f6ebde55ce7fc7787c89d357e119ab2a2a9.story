With handsome good looks and stellar performance on the pitch Aaron Ramsey is hotly tipped to be the next David Beckham.

The Welshman famously scored the winning goal in extra time of the 2014 FA Cup final and has since signed a contract with Elite models.

Now the Arsenal midfielder, 23, stars in Urban Active - Men's Health's brand new biannual supplement dedicated to fashion and sport - revealing his diet secrets and what he really thinks about modelling.

Handsome footballer Aaron Ramsey is hotly tipped to be the next David Beckham

Giving an insight into his daily diet, he said: 'Breakfast is muesli, a couple of eggs, green tea and a banana; lunch is fish with a big plate of vegetables and maybe a bit of rice.

'I stay away from desserts but every now
 and then I have a sticky toffee pudding or a cup of tea with some 
biscuits… I say "some", more like half a packet. I try not to keep any 
in the house.'

After a game, he swears by protein shakes and cherry supplements - 'they help you recover that extra one or two per cent,' he said.

Fashion is something the photogenic Ramsey is increasingly concerned about, having been signed to the special bookings' board of London's Elite model agency.

'There's been some banter about it from the lads. But I really enjoyed the Urban Active shoot,' he said of his recent turn in front of the camera.

He even got an edgy new haircut for the shoot, as previously reported by MailOnline.

'I like it, but it takes me too long to do in the morning,' he said of the style.

His preference for High Street brands such as Reiss reflects his humble upbringing, but he has more extravagant tastes in watches - wearing an Audemars Piguet. And, like many men, he loves expensive cars.

'They're my guilty pleasure. I drive a Mercedes SLS, which is fun. One of the nicest cars I've seen is the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta. I'd like to give that a go,' he admitted.
