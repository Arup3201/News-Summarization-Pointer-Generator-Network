Tony Blair’s Number 10 was packed with ‘very beautiful girls who were half in love’ with him while Margaret Thatcher ruled Downing Street through fear, according to political journalist Andrew Marr.

The BBC host lifted the lid on the culture inside Number 10 under successive Prime Ministers, and the attitude of staff to their masters.

John Major felt ‘besieged’ and Gordon Brown ‘disorganised’ but David Cameron is praised for conducting the business of government ‘very well’.

Tony Blair's Number 10 was 'full of very beautiful girls, half in love with Tony, with Cherie following around with a scowl', according to BBC journalist Andrew Marr

Marr, who has spent three decades reporting on British politics, said staff in Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street were 'terrified'

Marr, who now presents a Sunday morning political programme, is a former political editor of the BBC and ex-editor of The Independent newspaper.

He has written a novel, Head of State, which is set in a fictional Number 10 in 2017, and draws on his 30 years in political journalism.

He contrasts the different approaches Prime Ministers have taken to the way they run their governments, and who they choose to have closest to them.

Speaking at Cheltenham Literary Festival, Marr recalled how the Iron Lady’s Number 10 was a picture of calm, dominated by fear.

‘Thatcher had a lot of very bright ex-civil service and business people working for her. There were very tight lines of communication.

‘Almost pin-drop silent in case the PM walked through. They adored her, but were terrified of her,’ he said, according to the Gloucestershire Echo.

David Cameron is said to 'conduct the business of Number 10 very well' to the delight of the Civil Service

Staff in Gordon Brown's Number 10 were frightened of 'what mood he was in' while John Major felt 'besieged' throughout his time in office

By contrast, John Major’s inner sanctum was in perpetual crisis, as scandals and bitter divisions dominated the dying days of the Tory administration.

Marr said: ‘All the way through, he felt besieged. It felt as if there were forces out there, Thatcherite forces, socialist forces, all ganging up.

‘I was working as a columnist on The Independent, a low-level columnist, and the phone would go, and it was the Prime Minister on the phone bleating about how awful Charles Moore was being in The Telegraph. He would talk and talk. He was sitting there feeling misunderstood and unloved.’

However, his most surprising observations were of Tony Blair’s decade in Number 10 from 1997-2007.

‘His Number 10 was full of very beautiful girls, half in love with Tony, with Cherie following around with a scowl,’ Marr said.

‘There were two or three huge characters, Alastair Campbell, like him or loath him was a huge character. It was a sofa government, very informal, but very tightly organised.’

Marr has used his experience reporting on politics since 1984 for a new book set in a fictional Number 10 in 2017

Gordon Brown’s time in power was less happy. While he only moved from Number 11, where he spent 10 years as Chancellor, his operation as Prime Minister was notoriously dysfunctional.

‘His Number 10 was more formal and hierarchical and everyone was more scared of the Prime Minister and what mood he was in,’ Marr said.

‘It was much less organised, disorganised in many key ways. Paper didn’t flow through it properly.’

David Cameron, by contrast, is ‘loved by the Civil Service’, Marr claims.

‘All they want is for decisions to be taken clearly. They send him papers in the evening and he’s the first PM since Blair where the papers come back the following morning and he’s read them all, ticked and underlined and said yes or no. He conducts the business of Number 10 very well.’
