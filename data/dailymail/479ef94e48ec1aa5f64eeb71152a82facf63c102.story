Following Bayern Munich's 7-1 thrashing of Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night, one would think they would be less than welcome around the Italian capital.

However, the Bundesliga champions were greeted with open arms in the Vatican City, where they were granted an audience with Pope Francis, a self-confessed football fanatic.

On Wednesday morning, following their impressive showing at the Stadio Olimpico the night before, Bayern gathered at the Pope's famous residence where they handed over a signed shirt.

Their defender David Alaba was 'overwhelmed by one of the greatest experiences of my life' after meeting the Pope. 

Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge hinted before the meeting that he would also be handing over a surprise gift to the Argentine, a boyhood San Lorenzo supporter.

And Rummenigge delivered his present - a ball symbolising a promise of a Bayern Munich friendly match. 

The German side reported on their official Twitter page that the friendly would be used to donate €1million to a charity of His Holiness' choice.

The Pope praised Bayern's performance, telling the delegation they had played 'a wonderful game' and admitted his 'surprise' at the margin of victory over Roma.
