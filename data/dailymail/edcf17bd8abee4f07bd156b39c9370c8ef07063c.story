Everyone needs some form of motivation in their quest to shift that unwanted weight.

And one inspirational woman undertook a sponsored slim to raise money for a childless couple to have the IVF-treatment that may give them a child.

And the incentive to help has certainly been a success story, after Shanice Bulman has already lost six stone in just five months.

Shanice Bulman weighed 22 stone in January when she decided to take action

The 20-year-old from Hull, East Yorkshire, hated the sight of her size 24 body and at almost 23 stone, she no longer wanted to lead an unhealthy lifestyle, after not recognising herself when she looked in the mirror.

She said: 'I was getting ready and, usually, I’d feel great. I always wore nice clothes and did my hair and make-up. But my face looked swollen - I didn’t feel like Shanice any more.'

She lost six stone in just five months after eating healthy food and training hard

Shanice has hit her target one month ahead of schedule and she says she has never felt better.

She said: 'At the moment, this is the best I’ve ever felt,” she says. “Every day I wake up, I feel better than the day before.'

Shanice’s old habits meant she would wake up and skip breakfast before gorging on sandwiches, crisps and chocolate before she ate her lunch.

Her evening meal would consist of chicken wraps, rice, cheese or bread, followed by cups of tea and biscuits.

But, after turning her life around, she now visits the gym at least four times a week, facing two gruelling sessions with her personal trainer, James Brereton each week.

James also gave her an extra incentive to get fit - by donating £28 of her session fees to her sponsorship total.

Her hard work means Shanice has dropped four dress sizes since her weight war began, slimming-down to a size 16.

Shanice has had to turn her whole life around, following a strict healthy eating plan set by James.

She said: 'You have to change your whole lifestyle. Now, I cook for myself all the time - once I got my head around it, it’s the easiest thing I have ever done in my life. I even lost 1Ib on holiday.

'I feel like I have blinked and the six months has gone. It’s changed my life completely. If I have children in the future, I will raise them to be active and healthy and cook meals from fresh.

'I don’t class myself as being on a diet any more. It’s my lifestyle and this is how I want to eat.'

Shanice has already met with health officials at the Hull IVF Unit and will pick the couple to have treatment once she has raised the full £5,000.

She has so far raised £4,000 but wants to make sure she reaches her target so there is £500 left for baby clothes.

Shanice said: 'I would like to choose people who do not already have children, have had IVF once or twice and have been unsuccessful but still stand a good chance of becoming pregnant.

'Once I have given the money, I will feel complete - I set myself a challenge to raise this money for them. If they wanted to meet me, that would be amazing, but it’s OK if they don’t.

'Even if they don’t manage to get pregnant, at least they have had the extra opportunity.

Shanice has worked hard with trainer James Brereton to lose the weight, which she is being sponsored to do to fund IVF treatment

'I have worked so hard, but if it takes me until Christmas to get all the money in, it takes me until Christmas.'

Shanice is taking her weight loss process one step further and really turning it into a positive experience, she wants to become a mentor to help overweight people achieve similar goals.

Her parents plan to help her open her own studio in the city as a 21st birthday present, creating a base for her to support others.

Shanice said: 'I want to be there for people 24/7 and figure out what is going to work best for them so I can advise them on their lifestyle.

Shanice set herself the challenge of losing six stone in as many months, she has beaten her goal and raised money doing it

'The difference between me and your average personal trainer is I was 4lbs off 23st when I started and I know how that feels.

'The support I have had has been incredible, from people I don’t know e-mailing me, to people sending me messages to say I’m an inspiration.

'My parents and my sisters have been my lifeline and James has been amazing too and we have become good friends - I can’t thank him enough.'
