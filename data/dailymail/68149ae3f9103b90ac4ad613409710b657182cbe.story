The American executive who is still being held hostage at his company's factory outside of Beijing was trying to make light of the situation and keep his spirits high when he was interviewed on American television this morning.

'I got shaved today, I was given an electric razor so I'm feeling pretty good today,' Chip Starnes said from behind the caged windows of the Chinese factory.

'I decided I'm going to stick with the blue shirt all the way through, sort of like my little slogan thing.'

On lockdown: Chip Starnes has been held hostage in his factory outside of Beijing for the past five days

Getting his message out: He has been able to speak to several news outlets during the capture but has not been allowed off the grounds for fear that the workers will not be paid

Starnes, 42, has been held hostage for five days now as workers demanding severance packages like those given to 30 co-workers in a phased-out department.

Mr Starnes, a co-owner of Coral Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't being laid off.

He told The Today Show that he has tried to leave the plant but it his escape attempts have not worked.

He said that the conditions of his 
captivity have been reasonable, with McDonalds and KFC getting delivered
 to him for breakfast and Chinese food with rice for lunch.

The
 local police authorities have been alerted and are on site, but he said
 that is more to insure that he receives sufficient food and they have 
little interest in ending the dispute.

Missed: Starnes' wife said that they have spoken every day since he has been in captivity but that is not enough

'They're hands off here- they let the workers handle it themselves,' he said of the local authorities.

'I did try and actually go over the gate but they would not let me go,' he said.

His wife told NBC that while they have been in contact, that is not enough for their family.

'I just want him home, his kids want him home. Every day we do get to talk to him but it's very upsetting,' she said.

The workers were expecting wire 
transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been 
blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by 
shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office.

He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential.

'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes told The Associated Press on Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars.

'I think it's inhumane what is going on right now. I have been in this area for 10 years and created a lot of jobs and I would never have thought in my wildest imagination something like this would happen.'

Workers inside the compound, a pair of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media.

It is not rare in China for managers to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses.

The labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories. The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' demands - if true - reflects how officials typically consider stifling unrest to be a priority.

Huairou district and Qiaozi township governments declined to comment.

A local police spokesman said police were at the scene to maintain order. Four uniformed police and about a dozen other men who declined to identify themselves were standing across the road from the plant.

Demands: Mr Starnes said that dozens of workers demanding severance packages like those given to co-workers in a phased-out department

'As far as I know, there was a labor dispute between the workers and the company management and the dispute is being solved,' said spokesman Zhao Lu of the Huairou Public Security Bureau.

'I am not sure about the details of the solution, but I can guarantee the personal safety of the manager.'

Representatives from the U.S. Embassy stood outside the gate much of the day, and eventually were let in. U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his attorneys.

It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful.

Starnes said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division, planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for up to nine years, so their compensation packages were 'pretty nice,' he said.

Some of the workers in the other divisions got wind of this, and, coupled with rumors that the whole plant was moving to India, started demanding similar severance packages on Friday.

Christian Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he wasn't familiar with Starnes' case, but that such hostage-taking was 'not a major problem' for the foreign business community.

'It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time,' he said.

'It rarely leads to personal harm to the managers involved, but there are cases when it has in years past.'
