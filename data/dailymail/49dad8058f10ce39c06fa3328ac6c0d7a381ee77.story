Lewis Hamilton has barely put a foot wrong during the last year with Mercedes on the track, but the reigning Formula One world champion did admit to doing so off it in rather embarrassing circumstances.

The 30-year-old's success has enabled him to meet stars in other sports as well as showbiz celebrities and key political figures.

And it appears the British racer literally left his mark on one of the latter while attending Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday party seven years ago.

Speaking on BT Sport's The Clare Balding Show on Thursday night, Hamilton revealed how once stepped on the foot of former USA President Bill Clinton in his excitement to meet Hollywood actor Will Smith.

'I was lucky enough to be invited to Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday in London,' he told Balding.

'It was really cool because I arrived and I was on his table - I was like only two spots away from him. It was crazy.

'I noticed that Will Smith was there and I'm a big fan of Fresh Prince [of Bel Air] so I was like I want to meet Will.

'So when everyone started standing up, I was rushing to go and meet Will and as I was barging past people I stood really heavily on someones foot - I turned back and it was Bill Clinton.

'And I didn't even apologise, I just kept going.'
