Digg founder Kevin Rose has decided not to go ahead with plans to bulldoze his historic Oregon home after his neighbors' protest sparked a last-minute change of heart.

Rose, who founded the news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland.

But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property.

But now it has been revealed that Rose has reportedly agreed to sell the house to Tom and Jennifer Saunders, long-time residents of the neighborhood, reports Oregon Live.

'There has been a tentative agreement that has been reached that the house will be sold to Tom and Jennifer Saunders,' said Will Aitchison, the Portland attorney representing a neighborhood coalition.

'The hope by all concerned is that the sale will be completed by Friday. The sale will be for $1.375 million, the amount requested by Rose. We're all extremely hopeful that this is resolved.'

Aitchison released the following statement from Kevin and Darya Rose:

'Darya and I are happy to announce that we've come to an agreement with a long-time resident of Willamette Heights to sell 1627 NW 32nd Ave. The new buyer's intention is not to demolish the house, but rather restore and maintain it. While this agreement isn't fully finalized, we are hoping we can wrap things up quickly.

'Over the last few days we've watched as comments and emotions flared on both sides of the issue. Some folks arguing for homeowner rights, others for the preservation of old homes. We've read all of this, along with your emails, and took it all to heart.

'We decided on Portland not as an investment property, or vacation spot, but as a place we hope to one day call home, a place to raise our family. We love so much about your beautiful city, and your strong community bond is high up on that list. While we could have legally put our heads down and proceeded forward, that's not the type of relationship we want with our neighbors and our new city friends.

Updates: Rose and his wife had planned to remodel the five-bedroom house

Extra work: The couple then put in plans to demolish the family home because of concern over asbestos

The house, which was built in 1892, has been described as one of the 'great icons of Northwest Portland'.

Last week however, a permit was issued to tear the property down after Rose had it removed from an historic homes inventory.

Steve
 Wilson, who was one of the agents who listed the property, said he knew
 Rose and his wife Darya planned a remodel, but said he was shocked to 
hear it was going to be pulled down.

'We
 did expect him to do a substantial remodel, but you pay $1.3 million 
and tear a house down? In Portland? That doesn't happen in,' he told the
 Oregonian.

An online petition set up by the couple's new neighbors attracted more than 1,100 signatures since being set live.

In
 an open letter addressed to Rose and his wife, the petition states: 
'When several of us met you at this yearâ€™s Easter egg hunt, we were 
eager to find out about your plans.

'We were reassured that you had no plans to build on the spare lot, and were relieved to hear that you were committed to remodeling rather than demolishing the house.'

It added that the neighbors had been shocked to later hear that the property had been removed from Portland's landmark inventory and was set to be demolished.

Rose then responded to the petition, releasing a statement that claimed the couple had been left no choice after receiving a quote for remodeling that was more than the house price.

Despite having surveys done before agreeing to buy the house, the couple later discovered extensive repairs were needed.

Rose said that they asked the previous owner to buy back the house and fix the asbestos and other issues with it, and said if the demolition went ahead the materials would be recycled.

Unlisted: Kevin Rose had the house removed from a list of potentially significant properties

'We never intended to deceive anyone, as some of you have accused. We simply wanted to create a beautiful home for our family,' Rose said.

He added that the house had been listed as potentially significant on a voluntary register, but when an independent architect inspected it, they assured the couple it was not historically important.

Rose said the couple had hoped to just carry out an extensive remodel but 'the costs were higher than we anticipated, and we knew we could never recoup that kind of money on a 100 year-old house'.

Jim Draudt and Ann Witsil, who the Roses bought the house from, have also backed the petition to save the property, issuing a statement praising neighbors for raising concerns about the demolition.

'The only solution acceptable to us is to save the house, not to remove it,' the couple wrote.
