Several high-ranking officials in New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority are cashing in on overtime and padding their pensions, it has been revealed. 

Vincent Blackburn, who repairs commuter cars on the system’s Long Island Rail Road, brought home a stunning $135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone, the New York Post reported.

But Blackburn is only one of 20 MTA employees essentially tripling their incomes at a time when New York City subway riders are told they should expect more fare hikes in the not-too-distant future.

Training day: Vincent Blackburn, who repairs commuter cars on the Long Island Rail Road, brought home a stunning $135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone

Worker's rights: An obscure labour law called Rule 24 allows some train workers to claim massive amounts of overtime at the repair station in Queens

According to the Post, which obtained the payroll information through the Freedom of Information Act, Blackburn’s initial salary was a respectable $66,539.12.

He, as well as several other high-earning MTA workers- manage to earn their sky-high overtime through an antiquated labour loophole known as ‘Rule 24,’ which states that a train repairman must be on premise for all shifts, even if no trains require repair.

Blackburn works with other MTA staffers at the Richmond Hill, Queens repair shop repairing LIRR commuter trains. He refused comment to the Post.

Because of the labour law, Blackburn managed to earn more than the company’s COO, Robert Foran, who earns $197,532.25 per annum. 

MTA spokesperson Aaron Donovan confirmed to msnbc.com that Blackburn did indeed bring in more than $100,000 in overtime, and that Rule 24 is an issue they hope to address in the future.

He said: ‘Certainly people do earn overtime, but the overall aggregate figure is down,’ adding that overtime pay, especially within the LIRR, had gone down considerably in recent years.

Not fare: Commuters have seen several steep increases in LIRR and subway fares, and it's only expected to climb

Final destination: The LIRR serves around 6million commuters on Long Island who need to get into the city

Mr Donovan told the Post: ‘In 2010, 
overtime hours were reduced by 12.6 per cent, saving $13.4million, and 
remained at that reduced level in 2011.’

But that news may not be enough to sway commuters who have seen extreme fare increases in the past few years – and can expect more next year, and again in 2015.

After passing the so-called ‘Doomsday Budget’ in 2009 – which significantly raised fares for the subway, buses, bridges, and tunnels, many commuters thought they couldn't be more financial worry.

But in 2010, riders were subjected to fare increases for the third time in three years.

In 2008, the monthly unlimited MetroCard was $89. It currently costs $104.

In addition, the cost of a single ride is expected to be around $2.50 a ride by 2015, according to an exclusive NBC New York published in March.

Because of budget cuts, several lines were scrapped, including the W and V trains, and service was reduced in many stations. 

The MTA has struggled to meet the ever-increasing demands of New York’s demanding commuter population. It serves more than 14.9million customer with an average weekly ridership of 8.5million on more than 2,000 miles of track.

Among its larger undertakings are the long-talked about Second Avenue subway, the extension of the 7 line from Times Square to the West Side, and Grand Central access for LIRR commuters. 

These projects have all gone well over-budget and surpassed their initial timelines.
