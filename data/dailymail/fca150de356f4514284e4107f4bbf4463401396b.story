Cult leader and convicted sex offender, known to his followers as 'Little Pebble', is set to be freed from jail in Sydney within the week.

William Kamm, 64, has served more than nine years of his maximum 10-year sentence.

The self-described religious leader was handed separate sentences after ordering two teenage girls to have sex with him, saying it was God's will to help him repopulate the earth with his mystical seed.

Kamm founded the Order of Saint Charbel at Cambewarra, near Nowra, on the NSW south coast in the 1980s and convinced his followers he was God's spokesman on earth.

He manipulated a sect of old-line Catholic traditionalists to hand over their wives and daughters to populate his 'Royal House'.

He is believed to have fathered more than 20 children and duped dozens of females, telling them they were among the 12 queens and 72 princesses chosen to repopulate the earth after judgment day.

Kamm has been serving his time at Long Bay Correctional Centre in Malabar, a south-eastern suburb of Sydney.

Once released from jail, the 64-year-old will be electronically monitored and must not contact children under the age of 16 without the approval of a corrections officer

Kamm was sentenced to three and a half years behind bars in 2005 after raping and assaulting a teenager in 1993, the Sydney Morning Herald previously reported.

Two years later, other sex offences were added to his convictions and he was ordered to serve another seven and a half years with non-parole. 

Kamm was sentenced a maximum of 10 years for five counts of sexual intercourse with a minor by a person in authority, four counts of aggravated indecent assault against a minor and one count of aggravated indecent assault.

He has been banned from frequenting the Shoalhaven districts or communicating with his victims for the next 11 months.

In that time, the 64-year-old will be electronically monitored and must not contact children under the age of 16 without the approval of a corrections officer.

The State Parole Authority said Kamm would be released no later than November 18 and he must undergo psychological assessment and counselling.
