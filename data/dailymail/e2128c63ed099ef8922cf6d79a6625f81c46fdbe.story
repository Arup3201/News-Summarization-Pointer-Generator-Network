Bono's wealth soared today as Facebook floated on the stock exchange - boosting his stunning portfolio which includes properties, shares and even a Broadway show.

The Irish rocker's investment company Elevation Partners holds a 2.3 per cent stake in the social networking site which is now worth in excess of $1.5billion.

The company paid $90million for the shares in 2009 but they have rocketed in value.

Elevation: The IPO will make Bono the richest pop star in the world. But the move to place Facebook on the stock market has has evoked almost as many shivers of fear in the business world as it has gasps of excitement

Today, as Facebook launched on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a valuation of $104billion, it made more than 1,000 new millionaires - and investors such as Bono even richer.

It is a staggering market value - bigger than US manufacturing giants Ford and Boeing combined, and all the more incredible given that the site currently earns a fraction of what those ‘old world’ companies do.

There are nine other directors of Elevation Partners and it is thought that Bono owns a little over 10 per cent of the $1.5billion stake.

His band U2 are already worth $813million according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Although today will be a beautiful day for Bono, it is unclear exactly how much he is personally worth.

Wealth: Bono's house in Killiney, Ireland, which had its roof removed to add a second floor and new roof terraces. He owns a number of other properties around the world

His investment company Elevation Partners, named after a U2 song, was set up in 2004 with five former senior figures from the world of business, including the former chief financial officer of Apple Computers.

On top of his pot of social networking gold, Bono holds a portfolio of properties, cars and other investments.

Although his investment company has seen their Facebook shares soar in value, the luck of the Irish deserted Bono when the group injected cash into smartphone manufacturer Palm in 2007.

Elevation invested $480m in the firm, only to see Apple’s iPhone take the market by storm and bring Palm to its knees.

They did get their money back, however, when Hewlett-Packard snapped up Palm on the cheap, as Elevation had ring-fenced their investment with a clause that guaranteed reimbursement if it was sold.

Bono’s investments then got tangled in the sticky web of the Broadway Spider-Man musical, which was panned by the critics and plagued by a series of accidents.

It is understood U2 invested $65million in it, which some might say was sheer folly.

Though in the long run, now that the show is up and running smoothly, it could well be a money spinner.

It’s not likely that Bono lost an awful lot of sleep over his investments anyway, since the money he’s made from performing is vast.

Beyond his complex financial interests, the rocker has a property portfolio that includes a villa in the Southof France and a lavish Italian-style palazzo overlooking the seanear Dublin, not to mention the £15million penthouse onManhattan's Upper West side he bought from Apple founder SteveJobs.

The apartment, which takes up two floors of the 27-storey northtower of the ultra-exclusive San Remo building, is listed as one ofNew York's top 40 properties and boasts 12ft nickel and bronzedoors and floor-to-ceiling windows costing £40,000 each.

The building, which is also home to Steven Spielberg, is soselect that its management committee once blackballed Madonna'sattempts to move in.

Having said that, those who have visited describe Bono'sapartment, with its avant-garde stone walls and floors, as'charmless and stark'.

Despite its huge sun terrace with stunning views of CentralPark, one visitor commented: 'It has absolutely no warmth.'

Meanwhile, on top of his own lavish property in the upmarketKilliney district of Dublin - which he shares with his wife Ali and four children.

When he decided it wasn't big enough, the star paid £3million eight years ago to buy a neighbour's house and linked the two with a corridor.

Bono, whose real name is Paul Hewson, also counts a family-sizedMaserati among his fleet of luxury cars and is known for his tastefor fine food. He is also a noted wine connoisseur, who willregularly spend thousands on a single bottle at his favourite NewYork restaurants.

He and the three other members of U2, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullenand guitarist David 'The Edge' Evans, also invested in Vertigo3, an Airbus A320, to fly them around in style.
