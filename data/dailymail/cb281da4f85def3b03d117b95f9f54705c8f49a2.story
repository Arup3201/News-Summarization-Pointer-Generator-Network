Paul Farrand, 18, was found dead just hours after telling a health support worker that he wanted to die

The teenage son of a jailed paedophile former deputy headmaster took a fatal drug overdose after he endured a childhood of violence at the hands of his father, an inquest has heard.

Paul Farrand, 18, was found dead just hours after telling a health support worker that he wanted to die.

Heywood Coroner's Court heard that he teenager had attempted suicide 17 times in less than three years, after being subject to corporal punishment at the hands of his father Derek.

The former deputy head at Palatine High School in Blackpool, Lancashire once physically attacked his son after he caught him rummaging through his 'special cupboard', the inquest was told.

He was later arrested after complaints he had been molesting a 12 -year old daughter of family friends.  Now 61, Farrand snr is currently serving four and a half years in jail.

Paul - who the inquest heard had once tried to jump out of a window when he was only 11 - was so badly affected by his childhood experiences, it was feared he might be a risk to his siblings.

He was found dead at his flat five days after his 18th birthday after taking prescription pills.

At an inquest his mother Michelle, 39, of Heywood, Greater Manchester said: ‘His father was very aggressive with him. He was a paedophile and he had special cupboard for him and this girl.

'Paul used to take things out of it and Derek would get very aggressive and confront Paul, pushing him or screaming at him. Paul became very upset so I started to take the blame myself.'

She added: 'Paul was scared of turning 18. I think he was scared of being put into the adult world and I did not realise how upset he was. He was my little boy angel. He was a lovely lad.'

Earlier the Heywood hearing was told Paul harboured ambitions to be a mountain rescue climber but was taken into specialist care at the Hope Unit at Fairfield Hospital in Bury after he was unable to complete his last year at high school.

Heywood Coroner's Court heard that he teenager had attempted suicide 17 times in less than three years, after being subject to corporal punishment at the hands of his father Derek.

Mrs Farrand said: 'He would have mood 
swings. He sat there not wanting to do anything. He slept on the couch 
because there was no room. He said he heard voices.

'One night he woke me up because he got very angry because he heard voices.

'He became very distressed through the night. I stayed with him. He would lose his temper and smash things around.'

His mother was then told that her son could no longer come home as he was a risk to his siblings.

She said: 'I had to choose between Paul and the children because if I choose Paul the other children would go into care.

'I think the stress of being told he could not come home was too much - he could just not cope with it.

'I think he was scared he was going to be in a unit for the rest of his life.'

Paul was found dead at his flat a week later after the meeting in November last year.

Jessica Daly a support worker who was duty when Paul died said she came across the teenager at 1.40am in the unit.

She said: ‘He started staring, looking at me, very rigid. He was not talking to me but could recognise I was there.

'He kept repeating “I want to die.” We went down stairs in the living room for a couple of minutes. He was really aggravated, screaming “I hate god. Why has he done this to me, making me live when I feel like this?”

He appeared to calm down and went back to bed but later that day was found dead.

Records showed Paul tried to take his own life 17 times between February 2011 and November 2013.

But recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Michael Salt said he could not be certain Paul wanted to kill himself that night.

He said: 'He had previously taken action that affected himself and that could have ended his life. Did he fully intend the consequences of this occasion? I am not satisfied that we can say that beyond reasonable doubt.'

During his trial Farrand snr was said to have been infatuated with the girl after meeting her through family friends shortly before he retired from his job at a high school in 2009.

He initially bought her gifts including sweets, drinks and even a mobile phone to win her trust before subjecting to a string of attacks.

Farrand also took a picture of himself abusing the girl and sexually assaulted her older sister. The attack took place after Farrand found out the girl had been subjected to a previous rape which led to her attacker being jailed.

He was arrested June 2012 when a relative discovered hundreds of pornographic images on his computer including pictures of his young victim. When confronted Farrand turned himself into police.

He admitted sexual assault and taking or making indecent images of a child and was given a lifetime ban from working with children and must sign the Sex Offender Register for an indefinite period.
