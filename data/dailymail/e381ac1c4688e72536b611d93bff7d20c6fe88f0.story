It's the new party craze that will make nutritionists despair. Teenagers are ordering dozens of cartons of McDonald's French fries, spreading them in a giant pile across the table on trays and then digging right in.

They then take pictures of their 'potato party' and post them on Facebook, Twitter and blogs to show the world they aren't afraid of carbohydrates, or fat, or salt.

It started in Japan when McDonald's ran a promotion that meant all French fry sizes were £1 but has arrived in Korea and is spreading West-ward.

'Potato Parties', where teens order vast volumes of French fries, is a bizarre new internet food fad in the Far East

For reasons unknown, a group of Japanese teens ordered 23 large portions, upended the containers onto serving trays and took pictures before diving in.

The pictures of the unusual dining experience quickly went viral and copycats started holding their own potato parties and uploading their own pictures.

One group in the centre of Okayama, a city in the south of Japan, ordered a staggering sixty portions of large fries.

Temper: The South Korean teenagers annoyed the staff at this McDonald's and were asked to leave

The group even commemorated their pigging out session with a specially printed pink balloon.

According to Kotaku, the group ate every single last one - a total of around 30,000 calories. Now Potato Parties have made the leap to South Korea.

A group of Korean youngsters reportedly bought £165 worth of French fries and filled 16 service trays for their feast, enraging the restaurant's staff, who ordered the 'brats' to 'stop causing trouble' and 'get out of here', according to Gawker.

Someone claiming to be an employee of that McDonald's tweeted the person who posted the photo: 'Please stop, please stop'.

The supposed employee added that other customers had complained that the French fry eating went on for three hours, while people watching blocked the walkway, inconveniencing other patrons.

Social media users in the two countries were not impressed. Some said the stunt is rude and disrespectful to the low-wage workers expected to clear it up, while others felt the teenagers were wasting food.

'Look, buying 23 large French fries is fine, but you gotta eat them all, you gotta eat every last one,' tweeted one individual.

One user, Zane McCarty, was a bit more scathing. He said: 'Well, when they die of heart failure, at least there will be less stupid people to populate the earth.'

But erischild said: 'They paid for the food, they shouldn't be kicked out. They're going to suffer anyway when those fries are on the way out.'

Paul Greene concurs: 'They paid for the fries and it doesn't look like they are having a wild party.

'Some people should really just calm down.'

A spokeswoman for McDonald's said that she was not aware of any the bizarre dining rituals being held in the UK. She said: 'I've never heard of these parties'

Gluttony: In one Potato Party, Japanese teens bought 60 cartons and dug in, demolishing the lot

Asian news site RocketNews24 wrote 
that not only is the craze wildly unhealthy, they also keep other 
customers from enjoying their food.

'Not only do these hefty fry orders 
cause every other customer's food to be delayed,' the site writes, 'the 
rambunctious teenagers smugly eating their fries disturb the other 
customers eating at the restaurant.

'In Japan alone there have been 
complaints to the McDonald's corporate office ranging from annoyance to 
claims of unsanitary conditions as a result of these gatherings, as well
 as numerous pleas for the french fry discounts to stop.'
