The Queen is recruiting a washer-up who must be willing to travel for up to three months of the year around her palaces - just to do the dishes.

The £14,200-a-year employee will be based at Buckingham Palace but must be able to travel with a dishcloth to Windsor and Sandringham, and also to Balmoral and Holyroodhouse in Scotland.

A ‘General Catering Assistant (Wash Up)’ - as it has been described in a job advert - will work for 40 hours per week on the team 'responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the staff restaurant'.

The employee should be ‘punctual and reliable’, ‘able to work well in a team and have a flexible and willing attitude’ and ‘happy to travel and work at other royal residences in the UK and at weekends’.

The advert on the British Monarchy’s website added that it was ‘desirable’ for potential employees - who must get in their applications by next Tuesday - to ‘have experience of a similar type of role’.

‘You must be willing to work away at other royal residences for approximately three months of the year,’ it said, adding that the person will help ‘ensure smooth operation of the staff restaurant’.

‘You will join the team responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the staff restaurant, (and) wash-up areas and equipment in accordance with the health and hygiene regulations,’ it added.

Other job vacancies currently on the 
Queen's website include openings for a ticket sales assistant, building 
surveyor, retail assistant and warden team leader.

In October the Queen advertised for a gardener to maintain her Buckingham Palace lawns to 'the highest standards', encourage wildlife and recycle waste at her home - all for less than £300 a week.

The green-fingered candidate for the £14,950-a-year job also had to be proficient in 'good organic horticultural practices' when tending the Palace's shrub, herbaceous and rose borders.

In the same month the Queen also advertised for a new £26,000-a-year Royal party organiser, as she looked for someone to help manage and co-ordinate private and official royal functions.
