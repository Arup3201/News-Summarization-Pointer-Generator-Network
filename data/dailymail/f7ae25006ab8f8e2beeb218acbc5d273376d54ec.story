It won't be long until the royal baby will be presented to the world but for those who can't wait, here's how one designer predicts the prince of Cambridge will look.

Charanjeet Kondal, who founded the website 'Morph Thing', created his image of the heir to the throne by morphing the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Charanjeet, from Birmingham, said his programme takes the key features of each parent and morphs them together to predict the appearance of their off-spring.

He said: 'On each image focal features like the nose, eyes, mouth and eyebrows are taken and combined to find an average between them. That average is then taken from both images and then that average is combined to create the final image.'

He added that he is 'quite excited to see if my system prediction is right' now that Kate's son is due to be presented to the world.

Charanjeet isn't the first to imagine how the royal baby will look.

South Africa-based genetic counsellor Suretha Erasamus teamed up with graphic artist Theuns Kruger to reveal how she thinks the child will look as a toddler and a teenager.

Genetic guess: Suretha also predicted how the future Queen or King could look as a teen

Suretha based her judgements on the baby  taking after Prince William and his mother Princess Diana by having blonde hair and blue eyes. But the hair could darker as the years pass so the teenager royal bears a stronger resemblance to Kate.

Meanwhile Joe Mullins, a U.S. forensic artist, created images of how he thinks the royal baby will look based upon recent pictures of the Duke and Duchess, and their colouring, predominant genes and outstanding features.

He said he tries to make them as 'cute as possible' while also being highly scientific.

He said the future king or queen was bound to be 'adorable' and added: 'For Kate and William's baby - I think there is a lot of good genes in the mix there.

'There is a science behind the process. The darker features are more dominant with Kate's olive skin and dark hair.  I would say you are not going to get a fair skinned baby with blonde hair and blue eyes  - like Diana.'

Nickolay Lamm, from myvouchercodes.co.uk, and graphic designer Nikolett Mérész also created images of how a son or daughter of Prince William and Kate could look based on genetic trends.

They consulted Jenny Chen, a graduate student from Harvard-MIT, which is dedicated to genetics/genomics research, on what traits the child is likely to inherit from its royal parents.

She predicted the baby will have blue eyes and a strong nose like Prince Charles and William.
