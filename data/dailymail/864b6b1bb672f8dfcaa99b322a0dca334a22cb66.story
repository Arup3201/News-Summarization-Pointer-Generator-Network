Karen Sharpe, 54, allegedly gagged her granddaughter, 11, with soiled underwear

A southeast Ohio grandmother has been charged with child abuse for allegedly gagging an 11-year-old granddaughter with soiled men's underwear.

Sgt. Ed Downs of the Hocking County sheriff's office tells The Columbus Dispatch that it was 'the most disgusting, heinous' case of child abuse he'd ever seen.

Downs says the 54-year-old New Straitsville woman named Karen Sharpe, was arrested on Wednesday, after an older granddaughter secretly took cellphone video of the alleged abuse.

The video shows the woman forcing underwear soiled with feces into the 11-year-old's mouth and taping it there. When the girl vomited, her grandmother told her to swallow it.

The girl was being punished for stepping on the grandmother's injured foot.

The woman is being held with a $1 million bond on charges including kidnapping and endangering children.

The Columbus Dispatch reports that authorities wouldn't have known about the abuse had it not been for the 13-year-old elder child they call 'wise beyond her years.'

Sharpe allegedly punched the 13-year-old in the face and then the older child recorded the abuse on the younger child using a cell phone camera.  

The 13-year-old already has a metal plate in her head from abuse of another adult.

'Iâ€™ve never seen an animal being treated this way,' Downs said.

Sharpe has custody of the two girls who both have the same mother.

The girl were taken to another home by children's services.
