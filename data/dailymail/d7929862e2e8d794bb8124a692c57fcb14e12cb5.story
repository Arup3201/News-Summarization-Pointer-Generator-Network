QPR's woeful away form continued on Monday night as they crashed to their eighth defeat in eight matches on the road in the Premier League this season.

In fact, Rangers have won just two of their last 40 away top-flight matches, stretching back to their two-year stint among the elite before relegation in 2013.

The Premier League away table, supplied below by Opta, makes for grim reading for QPR fans.

Harry Redknapp's side have scored just three goals away from home this season, letting in 20, including three in Monday night's defeat by Everton.

They are the only side in the top flight to have not won a game on the road this season and that will surely have to change if they are to avoid relegation.

It has been a different tale at home for QPR, who have picked up 14 points at Loftus Road, winning four times.

Bottom-placed Leicester are unsurprisingly at the wrong end of the away Premier League table, too, having lost seven of their eight matches on the road.

Manchester City have the best away record of any side in the top flight, having lost just one of their nine matches on their travels.

League leaders Chelsea have the second-best away record, picking up 15 points from eight matches.
