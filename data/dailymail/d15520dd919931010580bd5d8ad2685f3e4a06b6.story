Among his bed-hopping exploits with Ulrika Jonsson, Faria Alam and Nancy Dell’Olio, it was perhaps a fleeting footnote.

But the night Sven-Goran Eriksson fled a woman’s flat trouserless after her husband walked in on them naked on the sofa must surely rank among his most embarrassing.

It seems the episode is one the unlikely lothario would rather have kept to himself, as it was not included in the English, Swedish, Italian,  Finnish or Danish version of his autobiography, serialised in the Mail.

Quite an own goal: Sven-Goran Eriksson promotes his autobiography, the Norwegian version of which accidentally contains the story about how he was once caught naked with a married woman

But the story did make it into the Norwegian edition.

The former England manager was caught in the act after a night out in Stockholm with Glenn Schiller, a former player from Swedish team IFK Gothenburg which Eriksson managed earlier in his career, and an unnamed female friend – who left with him.

‘We soon found ourselves naked on the sofa,’ wrote Eriksson.

‘She had not said anything about having a husband, but suddenly the door opened and there was a big man who said: “Who the hell are you?” I said: ‘I better leave,’ and he replied: ‘I think it’s probably for the best’.’

Couple: The affair between Nancy Dell' Olio and former England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson has been well-documented - especially by Nancy. But in his explosive memoir, Sven lifts the lid on his side of their turbulent romance

Eriksson left the flat dressed in only his underpants and shirt, leaving his jacket, trousers, wallet, mobile phone and size 6 shoes behind. He found a size 11 pair of basketball shoes in the stairwell as he fled.

‘I had to take them,’ he wrote, adding: ‘I wonder what would have happened if a photographer had seen me, walking around in nothing but a shirt with basketball shoes seven sizes too big?

'That would probably have created a few headlines.’

To make things worse Eriksson woke up the next morning in the wrong hotel. Staff there had recognised him and given him a room even though he had no money or credit card to pay the bill.

The next day they located where he was supposed to be staying and helped him make a discreet entrance through the hotel’s garage.

Eriksson said on Wednesday that the story was published ‘by mistake’.

His editor Stefan Hilding told a Swedish newspaper: ‘We took bits out and put bits in. The Norwegians have not taken this out. They’ve simply messed up and we are very sorry for this.’
