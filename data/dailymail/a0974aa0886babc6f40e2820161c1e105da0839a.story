It could have been the story of the year - 'The Queen has tested positive for morphine'.

Unfortunately, however, it was little more than a well-timed screen grab.

A picture appearing to show the BBC report that the Queen has tested positive for the drug morphine - and not her horse - is provoking much hilarity on Twitter.

The screen grab - taken at an opportune moment as the rolling news text scrolled across the bottom of the screen - omitted the crucial first half of the sentence.

Really? The BBC appeared to report that the Queen has tested positive for the drug morphine when this screen grab was taken - missing out key words

Estimate owned by the Queen tested positive for morphine, a prohibited substance, Buckingham Palace said

In its entirety, it would have read: 'A racehorse owned by the Queen has tested positive for morphine.'

It was revealed last night that Estimate, one of Her Majesty's prize racehorses, had tested positive for the banned drug.

BBC
 bosses seem to have seen the funny side of the joke - saying that 
usually viewers watch the news in whole, and not frame by frame.

A
 spokesman said: 'The ticker on the BBC News Channel correctly showed 
the whole headline "A racehorse owned by the Queen has tested positive 
for morphine" as it scrolled along the screen. A screen grab has been 
taken which omits "A racehorse owned by" and only shows the rest of the 
sentence. '

Estimate,
 a five-year-old filly, failed the test when the painkiller morphine was
 found in a sample taken after a race, Buckingham Palace said.

Trained
 by leading flat racing trainer Sir Michael Stoute, Estimate won the 
Ascot Gold Cup last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious 
race.

She came second in this year’s Gold Cup last month, when the test is believed to have occurred.

The
 revelation came five days after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA)
 announced that at least five horses, from various trainers, had tested 
positive for banned drugs following race meetings.

It has begun an investigation. Morphine is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days.

Initial 
indications are that Estimate’s positive test was caused by her eating 
contaminated feed, the Palace said. The Queen has been informed.

Following
 the BHA’s announcement, Northamptonshire-based feed manufacturer Dodson
 and Horrell, which has held a royal warrant since 1985, said its 
suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it 
destroyed all of its stock of a feed called Alfalfa Oil Plus.

The Queen watched Estimate win the Gold Cup on Ladies Day with her racing manager John Warren in 2013

John 
Warren, the Queen’s bloodstock and racing adviser, said: ‘Sir Michael is
 working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the 
product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables.

‘As the 
BHA investigates this matter, including potential links between the 
different cases, Sir Michael continues to offer his full co-operation.’

Once
 investigations are complete, the cases will be put before a BHA 
disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken.

This could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in.

If
 Estimate did test positive after this year’s Gold Cup, the horse could 
be stripped of her second place and the Queen would forfeit the £80,625 
prize.

When
 Estimate won last year’s Gold Cup, the Queen cheered her to victory and
 then joined jockey Ryan Moore and trainer Sir Michael for the 
presentation – which had to be hastily rearranged as she had been due to
 hand over the trophy.

The Duke of York stepped in to make the presentation to his mother, who also won £155,960 in prize money.
