Only three weeks after having a facelift, Sky News presenter Kay Burley was back in front of the camera.

Yet in the immediate aftermath of the operation, she could barely look at herself in the mirror.

Miss Burley admitted that the cosmetic surgery left her bruised, scarred and looking as if she had been in a car crash.

‘It’s a deeply traumatic procedure,’ she said.

‘It’s not painful at all, but when you look at yourself in the mirror, you think, “I’m never going to be me again”.’

The glamorous divorcee bought herself the lower face and neck lift earlier this year, after celebrating her 50th birthday, and said she was thrilled with the results.

A decade ago she had an eye lift after turning 40, and she has not ruled out going under the knife again.

She insisted that she had not felt under pressure to look younger for  her job, despite recent ageism rows including Countryfile  presenter Miriam O’Reilly’s successful legal action against the BBC.

‘People say, “It’s because you’re on the telly”,’ she told the Times.

‘No, it’s because I’m a woman and I want to look nice.

‘If Mother Nature needs a helping hand, why not?

‘I’ve always tried to take care of 
myself, but this was something that no matter how many calories I burnt 
off, it didn’t make any difference.’

‘I
 don’t want to be a poster girl for having cosmetic surgery, but I’m 
very happy to say, “Don’t be frightened, do your research, choose the 
right  surgeon, and if you still want to go ahead, then don’t worry”.’

Familiar face: Kay Burley, a presenter for Sky News, is a household name

Miss Burley said she spent months researching her planned operation and selecting the right surgeon.

She compared it to choosing a plumber, saying: ‘When you have your plumbing done, you get three quotes. It’s a bit  like that.’

She chose Rajiv Grover, the president-elect of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who performs more than 100 facelifts a year.

The mother of one said she had not told her son she was going into hospital until after the operation, because he was studying for his A-levels and she did not want him to worry about her.

She did not reveal how much the operation cost, but said it was ‘money well spent’.
