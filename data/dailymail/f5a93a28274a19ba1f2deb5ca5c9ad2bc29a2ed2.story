The Australian Medical Association's Tony Bartone says alcohol advertising on receipts is sending the wrong message to young people

Australian doctors want to see the end of alcohol advertising on supermarket receipts because it sends the wrong message to young people.

The Australian Medical Association says shopping dockets are an 'inappropriate' place to expose young people to alcohol.

AMA Victorian president Dr Tony Bartone said it was now commonplace for receipts to have alcohol discounts printed on them, such as two-for-one wine offers.

'It is virtually impossible now to get a docket without that printed at the bottom,' Dr Bartone said on Wednesday.

'Supermarket docket receipts are an inappropriate place to be advertising alcohol, especially to young people going in to make non-alcohol-related purchases.'

The alcohol ad ban is part of the AMA's wish list issued ahead of the November 29 Victorian election.

The AMA also wants expanded health services in Melbourne's growth corridors, a ban on smoking in outdoor dining areas and licensing for tobacco retailers.

It wants regular publishing of public hospital bed numbers and elective surgery waiting lists to improve transparency.

The association also sees the need for better communication between hospitals and general practitioners as faxes were still widely used for sending medical records and test results.

Both major parties should also clearly commit to matching any reduction in federal funding for health, the AMA said.

The wish list comes after the state's Health Minister David Davis announced the government would ban smoking in outdoor eating areas in Victoria, but not before the next election.

He said the government wanted to prevent smokers lighting up in alfresco dining venues, but needed to consult with the industry to determine the details of the ban.

Mr Davis could not say when the changes would come into effect or what it would mean for outdoor drinking areas.

The laws will not be changed before the November 29 election, but Mr Davis said legislation will 'certainly' be introduced in the next term of government.

'It will apply to areas where there's dining and the matters around drinking will be worked out steadily in this process,' Mr Davis told reporters on Monday.
