The husband of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by his best friend has described the moment he found his friend standing over his wife, holding a knife.

Jonathan Broyhill  is accused of stabbing 29-year-old Jamie Hahn to death in her North Raleigh home in Carolina, and then turning the knife on his friend Nation Hahn as he tried to help his wife. 

Mr Hahn told a court in North Carolina that he ran down the stairs after he heard his wife scream, only to see Broyhill 'standing over her with a knife.'  

Widower Nation Hahn has described the moment he found his wife injured in their home, with his best friend Jonathan Broyhill, standing over her with a knife. He claims Broyhill slashed him as he tried to help her 

The 33-year-old allegedly slashed Mr Hahn as he tried to help his wife, leaving him with minor injuries. 

He has been charged with first degree murder, attempted murder and felony assault.  

The court had previously heard that Jamie Hahn was a political strategist who worked for Sky Blue Strategies and employed Broyhill - best man to her husband at their wedding - to do accounting work, ABC news reported.

Broyhill was in charge of campaign financing and providing reports to the Financial Elections Commission, but was accused of embezzling almost $50,000. 

The court heard that Mrs Hahn had started asking questions about the financial irregularities shortly before the attack. Mr Hahn said he did not think his wife knew about the alleged embezzling but said she was frustrated about the financial problems and concerned these had not been resolved. Broyhill had allegedly been avoiding speaking to her. 

Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, told the court that on 22 April 2013 he heard his wife scream and came running down the stairs.

He said: 'I sort of rounded the corner of the stairs, and my eyes immediately went ... [to where] there was blood on the floor, and I could see Jamie's legs sticking out from behind.'

Mr Hahn, 28, described seeing Broyhill in the kitchen standing over his wife with a knife and claims he slashed him as he went to try and console her.

He said she had earlier shouted out his name and then Broyhill's and said: 'He's trying to kill me.' 

The couple were both taken to hospital but Mrs Hahn died two days later of her injuries.  She had been stabbed nearly a dozen times, leaving her with a severed artery and her liver severely lacerated, the News Observer reported.

Mr Hahn described Broyhill as looking 'stone faced' during the attack - in sharp contrast to the smiling man who had given him a hug when he came through the door earlier.  

Mr Hahn told the court during his best man's trial that he came down the stairs when he heard his wife scream and saw Broyhill standing over her with a knife as she lay on the floor in the kitchen 

Lawyers defending Broyhill said his mental state was unraveling in the run up to the attack, which saw him falsely claim he had pancreatic cancer and was suffering from MS. 

They admitted he had stabbed Hahn, but said he only meant to injure himself. 

Caroline Elliot, defending, said: 'Jon was determined to take his own life.

'He had no motive to kill those he loved. Something snapped.'

Friends have previously told how the Hahns had asked the Reverend Nancy Petty to pray for Broyhill during his cancer struggle, according to members of the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh.

Facebook pictures show the trio were firm friends, having shared several holidays abroad together 

Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and married in 2009, she was murdered four years later 

He was also said to be a regular visitor to their home and had dinner with them every week.  

Facebook pictures show the three had a close relationship - enjoying watching sports games at home and traveling abroad to share holidays.

Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009.

Mr Hahn and Broyhill were believed to be close friends, having met during a church trip in 2000.  

Yesterday a Superior Court judge dismissed a juror from the trial who had been overheard talking about discussing the case with his wife. He rejected calls for a mistrial. 

The case continues.
