Twitter has launched its much anticipated video service, allowing users to edit and upload clips up to 30 seconds long from its app.

The firm said the service will run 'alongside', rather than instead of Twitter's six-second video service Vine. 

The firm also said it is allowing group DMs for the firm time in a move designed to take on WhatApp and other messaging services.

Twitter will allow users to edit and embed 30 second video clips in tweets using its new editor

Twitter's mobile video camera and inline editing lets users  capture and share videos up to 30 seconds directly from the app.

Twitter for iPhone users will be able to upload videos from the camera roll as well. 

Twitter's product director, Jinen Kamdar, told MailOnline the video service was expected to be particularly popular among the service's celebrity users.

'We think this will give people a whole new way to communicate on Twitter. 

'We think we've struck a balance that makes it easier for people to share, and it's not so long that people will be turned off'.

Kamdar also confirmed the videos will not autoplay, but instead require users to click on then.

'Viewing and playing videos is just as simple: videos are previewed with a thumbnail and you can play them with just one tap.' 

 'In just a few taps you can add a video to unfolding conversations, share your perspective of a live event, and show your everyday moments instantly, without ever having to leave the app.'

He said the move to video came as users wanted to expand their tweets.

'Tweets have been more than 140 characters for some time. 

'The Twitter you experience today is rich and immersive, full of images, gifs, Vines, audio files and videos from some of the world’s most recognizable figures and brands. 

'And starting today, everyone will soon be able to seamlessly capture, edit and share videos right from the Twitter app, too. 

The group direct messaging feature will allow users to carry out private chats with multiple friends away from their public timelines. 

The change comes after other recent improvements to DM functionality, including the ability to send pictures.

'Twitter users will be able to add multiple followers into the group chats, who can then add their own followers in turn.' 

'Many people Direct Messages to reach the people and brands you’re only connected to on Twitter, who you perhaps don't have a phone number for. '

Twitter, which says its ambition is to build 'the largest daily audience in the world,' is hoping to get more people to use the service and to get the people already using the service to engage with it more frequently.

It recently introduced a new 'while you were away: feature that highlights important tweets that were posted while a user was offline.
