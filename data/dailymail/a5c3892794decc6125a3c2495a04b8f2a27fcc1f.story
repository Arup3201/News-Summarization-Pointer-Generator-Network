Paedophile Leonard Davey has been jailed after the girl he abused 40 years ago saw him on a bus

A child abuse victim who was assaulted four decades ago has finally seen her attacker brought to justice after spotting him on a bus staring through the window at a youngster.

The victim was only eight when government scientist Leonard Davey abused her in her home.

She reported him to the police after she found herself on a bus with him and by chance saw him looking at a naked child who was playing on a balcony.

She was so shocked by his reaction that she realised she had to report her own abuse to prevent him from harming any other children in the future.

Defra researcher Davey, 64, of Exeter, was jailed for three and a half years at Exeter Crown Court today after being found guilty of nine indecent assaults on two different girls in cases which dated back to the 1960s and 70s.

One victim who lived near to Davey was assaulted between the ages of eight and 21. The abuse over a 13 year period began with doctors and nurses games but progressed to more serious sexual activity.

He abused the other girl during visits to her parents. He sneaked into her bedroom after telling her parents he was going upstairs to the bathroom.

Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, told him: 'The jury, in my opinion rightly, found the victims to be compelling and truthful witnesses even though they were looking back many years. It is unfortunate you continue to maintain one or both are lying.

'You admitted some of the activity but said it happened at a time before you were 14 but the jury accepted her evidence about the timing.

'It is clear that you in effect destroyed her childhood and her teenaged years and the effect on her in later life has been entirely predictable and understandable.'

The judge placed him on the sex offenders’ register for life and imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention order which forbids unsupervised contact with anyone under 16.

After the case the second victim said: 'My aim was to make sure he could not get at any other children in the future.

'I was on a bus home and I saw him on it. Suddenly a young girl ran out on to a balcony naked as we were going.

'His reaction was so extreme it was scary. It was as if his eyes were popping out of his head. It brought everything back and at that moment I knew I had to go to the police.

'The chances against a child running out like that as the bus passed must be millions to one. It was an extraordinary coincidence. Perhaps it was divine intervention.

'It was a very, very hard thing to do because I had put the abuse behind me and it was difficult to relive it. It meant I carried it with me all the time whereas I had been able to bury it for a while.

'What he did has had a long lasting effect on my life. I don’t trust anyone and I don’t like being touched.'

The first victim said she believes the publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile case made it easier for the jury to accept that victims can come forward so many years after they were abused.

She said: 'I don’t think the sentence was long enough when you consider what he did to me over 13 years but the most important thing is that he was found guilty and we were believed.

'I did not report it at the time because I did not think anyone would believe me but it has had a dreadful effect on my life. It is why I am on my own now.

'This trial took place when the allegations against Jimmy Savile were coming out and I think it may have helped the jury to understand why some people keep these things secret for so long.

'It was different in those days. People did not come forward so easily. I hope that cases like these will help those who are being abused now to report it straight away.

'I did not do this for myself but for other people and to make sure that other people’s children would be safe.'

Davey was employed as a respected research assistant for the Centre for Rural Policy at Exeter University for 18 years, where he worked for Defra and the European Commission.

Davey admitted sexual contact with the first victim but said it happened when he was very young during 'doctor and nurse' games and while playing on the canal bank in Exeter. He denied any touching of the second victim.
