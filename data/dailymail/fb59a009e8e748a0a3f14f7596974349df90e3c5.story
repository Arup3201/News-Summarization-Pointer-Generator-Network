A 16-year-old stowaway has miraculously survived flying halfway across the Pacific in the wheel well of a flight from California to Hawaii - despite temperatures of -81F (-62C) at 38,000 feet.

The teen was discovered on the tarmac at the Maui airport on Sunday carrying no ID or belongings - apart from a comb - and told the FBI he had run away from home after an argument with his parents.

'Kid's lucky to be alive,' FBI spokesman Tom Simon in Honolulu said on Sunday night.

Among those skeptical about his journey, medical experts said his body would have had to fall into a hibernation-like state - with his heart beating only a couple of times a minute - for him to survive.

But Simon said security footage from the San Jose airport verified that the boy, who is from Santa Clara, California, hopped a fence to get to Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 on Sunday morning.

Simon said when the flight landed in Maui, the boy remained unconscious for about an hour, but eventually hopped down from the wheel well and started wandering around the airport grounds.

'He was unconscious for the lion's share of the flight,' Simon said. The flight lasted about 5 1/2 hours.

Hawaiian Airlines spokesman Alison Croyle said airline personnel noticed the boy on the ramp after the flight arrived and immediately notified airport security.

A picture of the teen being taken away for medical care, looking awake and alert, was provided to the MailOnline by The Maui News.

Staggering: The 16-year-old somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well

The boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services.

'Our primary concern now is for the well-being of the boy, who is exceptionally lucky to have survived,' Croyle said.

Simon said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed.

The
 sheer physical stresses on the body any stowaway climbing inside the 
landing gear faces are incredible. Most are simply fatal.

According
 to the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical 
Institute, the chances of survival of a wheel-well stowaway on a 
commercial aircraft are around 24 per cent.

Avoiding
 being crushed when the undercarriage retracts is the first challenge 
faced and then in quick succession, hypothermia, hypoxia and ultimately 
falling when the doors reopen.

Obviously the landing gear well has no heat or oxygen supply and is not pressurized.

At 18,000 feet, the oxygen supply becomes so depleted that the stowaway is likely to lose consciousness.

Anywhere
 above 33,000 feet, the stowaway's lungs would be in need of artificial 
pressure to be able to expand and contract normally.

Mount Everest is 29,029ft and only 5 per cent of the 3,000+ who have made that ascent have done so without oxygen

At 38,000 feet, the temperature would be no more than -81f, which usually would prove fatal within minutes.

And
 as the plane comes into land, assuming the stowaway is even conscious, 
they would have to avoid being crushed again or falling thousands of 
feet to their death.

'Doesn't even remember the flight,' Simon said. 'It's amazing he survived that.'

But news of the survival was met with suspicion, as most wheel-well stowaways don't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen.

Among the skeptics was ABC News aviation consultant John Nance, who said: 'This is a first in medical science and a first in physiology. I just don't believe it.'

Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, said to survive such conditions, the body has to fall into a hibernation-like state, with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute.

'It's near impossible, almost miraculous, and maybe there's more to the story,' Besser said.

Another aviation expert, Peter Forman, said that he was staggered the boy survived.

'The
 odds of a person surviving that long of a flight at that altitude are 
very remote, actually. I mean, you are talking about altitudes that are 
well above the altitude of Mt. Everest. And temperatures that can reach 40 degrees below zero,' Forman said.

'A lot of people would only have useful consciousness for a minute or two at that altitude.

'For
 somebody to survive multiple hours with that lack of oxygen and that 
cold is just miraculous. I've never heard of anything like that before.'

His misadventure also raised security questions. A Congressman who serves on the Homeland Security committee wondered how the teen could have got onto the airfield at San Jose unnoticed.

'I have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters. #Stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed,' tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco Bay Area's eastern cities and suburbs.

A call and email message to a Mineta San Jose International Airport spokeswoman were not immediately returned.

Officials
 at Kahului Airport referred questions to the State Department of 
Transportation, which did not return a phone call seeking comment.

Hawaiian
 Airlines Flight 24 to Oakland, California, was delayed nearly three hours 
Sunday due to the incident. The flight was scheduled to leave Kahului at
 noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m.

A male passenger who declined to be 
identified said that he was seated on the plane to Oakland with his 
family before he was notified of the delay. He said that flight 
attendants were told to disarm the doors and that the flight would be 
delayed 10 to 15 minutes.

A Transportation Security Agency spokesman who declined to be named referred questions to the FBI and airport authorities.

In August, a 13- or 14-year-old boy in Nigeria survived a 35-minute trip
 in the wheel well of a domestic flight after stowing away.

Authorities 
credited the flight's short duration and altitude of about 25,000.

Others stowing away in wheel wells have died, including a 16-year-old 
killed after stowing away aboard a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to 
Boston in 2010 and a 26-year-old man who fell onto a suburban London street from a flight from Angola inÂ 2012.

September 2012:
 A 26-year-old Mozambique national flying from Angola to Heathrow 
Airport in London was found dead in a suburban street under the flight 
path after presumably falling to his death as the undercarriage opened.

August 2012:
 Another man was found dead in the landing gear bay of a Boring 747 when
 it landed at Heathrow from a flight from Cape Town, South Africa.

June 2010:
 A 20-year-old Romanian man survived -41f temperatures for 100 minutes 
during a flight from Vienna to Heathrow. He survived because the plane 
stayed at 25,000 feet due to thunderstorms.

2006:
 Fidel Maruhi flew from Tahiti to LA and his core body temperature was 
79 degrees Fahrenheit when he arrived at the UCLA Medical Center for 
treatment of hypothermia and dehydration. Anything below 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit is usually fatal.

December 2002:
 Cuban refugee Victor Alvarez Molina flew four hours from Havana to 
Montreal in a DC-10 in temperatures below -41f. He survived due to a 
leaky pipe which shot out warm air and also gave him something to hold 
onto when the plane landed.
