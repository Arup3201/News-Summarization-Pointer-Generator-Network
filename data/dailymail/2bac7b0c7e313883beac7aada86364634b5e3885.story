Police have identified the man who stabbed a woman and killed his own father with a bow and arrow before killing himself in a senseless act of murder at a central Wyoming community college.

Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said today that Christopher Krumm, 25, of Vernon, Connecticut, first stabbed his dad's girlfriend Heidi Arnold, 42, about two miles southwest of Casper College on Friday morning.

Krumm then went to the college and shot his father, 56-year-old computer science instructor James Krumm, in the head with the bow-and-arrow in front of his horrified students.

On Duty: Police officers responded in full tactical gear to the campus attack at Casper College.

No Suspects: Police say they no longer have any suspects, suggesting that the attacker may have been one of the three dead.

He then stabbed himself with a large knife.

Walsh said the younger Krumm smuggled the weapon into the classroom under a blanket.

The classroom killing prompted a 
college-wide lockdown as police attempted to ensure that it did not 
spiral into yet another campus massacre.

Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said investigators were still trying to determine a motive.

Christopher Krumm graduated from the University of Colorado in 2008, where he studied in the school's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Lockdown: Casper College was put on lockdown after apparent bow and arrow attack that left three people dead.

'I want to emphasize that this is a 
horrible tragedy,' Walsh said. 'And I want the city to... just feel safe
 right now. There is no one at large.'

The attack at the two-year community 
college in Casper occurred just before 9am in a classroom on the science
 building's third floor. All students and staff were evacuated from the 
building.

The college sent out a campus-wide 
alert via text message and email within two minutes of receiving word of
 the attack at 9.06am, school spokesman Rich Fujita said.

The lockdown 
ended at about 11am after school officials received word that police 
were no longer searching for a suspect.

There are fewer classes on Fridays 
than any other day of the week at Casper College, so only between 1,500 
and 2,000 of the college's 5,000 students were there, Fujita added.

Tragedy: Students and staff listen to a new conference discussing the apparent murder-suicide on their campus.

Political science instructor Chris 
Henrichsen said he was showing the film Frost/Nixon to his government 
class when he stepped into the hall to get something for a student and 
was told a homicide had occurred on campus.

He went back to his classroom, where students were getting messages about the campus lockdown on their phones.

'We locked the door and waited for further instruction,' Henrichsen said.

The students were later sent home, 
but some who parked near a different campus building where the attack 
occurred had to leave their cars there, Henrichsen said.

About two miles away, Dave Larsen 
said he was headed to the gym when he drove past a body in a gutter with
 two people standing over it, one talking on a cellphone.

Larsen lives about a block from the location of the body, a well-kept neighborhood of mostly single-story houses.

Emergency vehicles had the street blocked off on Friday afternoon.

Scene: The horrific murder-suicide took place in the science building of the community college

Walsh said 33 law enforcement 
officers from different agencies responded to the college after 
receiving reports of the attack. He said authorities first thought it 
might have been an 'active-shooter-type situation.'

'We quickly contained the building and started a sweep through the building,' he said.

Walsh said that within minutes of the
 initial call, there was another report of a traumatic injury about two 
miles southwest of campus. That victim was found in the street, the 
Star-Tribune reported.

Classes were canceled for the rest of the day at the school, one of seven community colleges in Wyoming.

A meeting was held in the afternoon 
for the 150 teachers and students who remained. College president Walt 
Nolte addressed them, calling it the worst day of his more than 40 years
 in higher education and encouraging the community to come together.

'It is particularly painful because of our size,' Fujita said of the small, tight-knit campus.

Counselors were speaking to students and planned to be available through the weekend. About 450 students live on campus.

Classes are due to resume on Monday.

'We agreed it doesn't do any good to 
just set the students loose. It makes the most sense to have them come 
back to campus, where they can get help if they need help and come to 
terms with what happened,' Fujita said.

Investigation: Police were concerned there could be a gunman at large on the campus or in the town

Walsh said police train for such incidents but had no warning of Friday's violence.

Wyoming governor Matt Mead, who went 
to the campus on Friday evening, said it was too early to assess 
security precautions at the college.

'There's no sense in doing that now until we understand fully what has taken place,' he said.

The governor added that the focus now
 'should be on the victims' family, the community college family, the 
president, the trustees and the students, and making sure we're 
attending to any of their needs.'

Casper College opened in 1945 as the 
state's first junior college and moved to its current site 10 years 
later. The campus consists of 28 buildings on more than 200 acres. The 
college provides more than 140 academic-transfer, technical and career 
programs.

Casper is Wyoming's second-largest 
city with a population of about 56,000. Wyoming residents refer to it as
 the 'Oil City' because it's a hub for the state's oil industry.
