Fluttering and dancing in the breeze, this sea of golden daffodils should easily lift the spirits on a chilly day.

The sight, however, just tells a tale of woe for their growers.

Blooming too late to be picked and sold at market, this glorious vision will simply be left to rot.

The freezing March conditions meant many of the flowers opened weeks after Mother’s Day and Easter, when they are traditionally in highest demand.

The warmer weather has now sparked a glut of daffodils, but shops and supermarkets are unwilling to buy stems that have already blossomed.

‘The cold weather means the daffodils are way behind this year and all the varieties have flowered late,’ said Claire Taylor, who is chairman of the British Daffodil Growers’ Association and works at Taylor’s Bulbs in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

‘A month ago we were struggling to meet demand as everyone wanted daffodils for Mother’s Day and Easter and there were none around.

‘Now they have appeared but the market has collapsed, orders have completely dried up and prices have fallen through the floor. It means there are lots of daffodils in our fields that we’ll simply leave as there is no point in picking them.’

Although the flowers will be left to rot, they will nourish the soil in the field

Britain is the world’s largest producer of cut daffodils and makes £23million per year from the industry. It also produces half the globe’s daffodil bulbs.

Miss Taylor, whose farm grows 400 acres of daffodils, said there were at least ten varieties that will not be picked this year as they have flowered too late.

They stopped picking last weekend and the remaining flowers will now be left to die, so the nutrients go back in to the bulbs.

Despite the poor weather the farm enjoyed a good season because the shortage of daffodils in early spring, meant they sold at a higher price.

She said: ‘The trade has finished now for the year and all growers across the country are in the same situation as me. They will all have late varieties of daffodils which have only just flowered and there is no market for them.

‘The warm weather means people start wanting summer flowers now instead.’

Sandra Baxter, of The Daffodil Society, said: ‘It’s the wrong time of year for people to buy daffodils.

'They are out in their gardens concentrating on summer bedding flowers instead. Most growers will have stopped picking now as people just don’t want to see daffodils in their homes now.’

The next generation could struggle to see native bluebells in UK woodlands as hybrid varieties take over, experts have warned.

Carpets of scented native bluebells are one of the sights of spring in ancient woodland, but the plant has bred with the non-native Spanish bluebell, which was introduced more than a century ago.

Entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease

The Forestry Commission predicts the British bluebell could be overtaken by hybrids – which have unscented lighter blue flowers – within a generation.

Not only would this mean that woodlands lose their traditional scented, deep blue displays of flowers but also, if only hybrids remained, entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease.

Those keen to see bluebells this year 
have been warned they will have to wait a few more weeks, as the cold 
weather has held back their arrival.
