With their distinctive brown uniforms, prim manners and old-fashioned sewing skills, they may look like a throwback to a bygone age.

But the graduates of elite nanny school Norland College have had to learn to adapt to our more violent times.

The prestigious institution – which has supplied childcare to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Mick Jagger – now teaches its students skills that are more often associated with James Bond than with Mary Poppins.

The graduates of Britain's Poshest Nannies are the subject of a new documentary on ITV tomorrow night

From evasive driving to help them escape from ambushes, to martial arts while pushing a pram, it is training a new generation of ninja nannies able protect the children of the rich and famous.

A new ITV documentary has been granted exclusive access to the school in Bath, Somerset, and followed a class of prospective students as they went through their rigorous training.

In March, Norland found itself in the 
spotlight when it was announced one of its graduates – 43-year-old Maria
 Teresa Turrion Borrallo – had been hired by Kensington Palace to look 
after Prince George. 

The documentary followed a group of students, above, as 
they completed the second of their three-year training at the 
£13,000-a-year school. Part of the training involves learning to drive at high speed

Each student is also given a virtual baby to look after for two nights, which is 
fitted with a computer chip to make it cry like a real-life child

The child must be soothed by the trainee nannies at all hours to prepare them for their future employment

Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training.

Its alumni include Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, nanny to Prince George.

Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates would be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.

The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'.

Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood.

Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education.

It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals.

Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi.

In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi.

She is the latest in a long line of Norland alumni to look after Royal Babies, with Princess Anne and the Duchess of York also among those who have used their services.

Sir Mick and his ex-wife Jerry Hall also hired a Norland nanny to look after their children Lizzie, 30, and James, 29.

Now viewers will be able to see just what makes them so well equipped to care for celebrity offspring.

The documentary followed a group of students as they completed the second of their three years of training at the £13,000-a-year school.

As well as learning traditional skills like sewing and cooking healthy children’s meals on an Aga, they are given classes in social science, psychology, child health, history and literature.

Every student – the school has only had one male graduate – also has to look after a virtual baby for two nights.

Fitted with a computer chip, each doll is programmed to cry like a real-life child and must be soothed at all hours.

But it is the more extreme parts of the curriculum that will attract viewers’ attention.

Each pupil is drilled in a brand of the Korean martial art Taekwondo that teaches them to fend off would-be kidnappers with a flurry of kicks and punches.

The instructors teach them to put the assailant in a headlock while controlling a pram, and give more self-defence basic tips, such a keeping their keys at the ready as a potential weapon when walking at night.

Another class sees the pupils learn extreme driving skills at a racing circuit in Wiltshire.

As well as first-aid training, the students are also taught life-guard skills in case they need to rescue a child during a beach holiday

They must learn to drive at high speed in
 any weather condition, navigate slippery roads without losing control 
and burst through road-blocks.

As well as 
being given basic first-aid training, they are also taught life-guard 
skills in case they need to rescue one of their tiny charges from the 
sea during a beach holiday.

Norland’s
 principal Liz Hunt told the Mail the skills are now a required part of 
any elite nanny’s CV thanks to the ever-increasing demands of wealthy 
parents.

The school counts the nanny to Prince George, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, among its alumni

She said: ‘When you hire a nanny, you want to know she will protect your child to the best of her ability. We hope these skills won’t be used, but it is better to be safe than sorry.

‘They need all the traditional skills as well, but there are things they can do that Mary Poppins would probably have been a bit envious of, even if she could fly away on her magic umbrella.’

One of the students, Georgie Buntine, 20, said: ‘My friends think it is hilarious that I’ve become a Norland nanny, mainly because of the uniform. At the school we have to keep our hair in buns, and we have to maintain a certain standard.

‘I hope I never have to use the self-defence skills, but it is nice to know I could look after myself if I had to.’

Britain’s Poshest Nannies airs on ITV on July 17 at 9pm.
