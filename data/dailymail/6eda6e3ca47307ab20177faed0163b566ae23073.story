It's back again, that often derided and much maligned competition currently known as the Capital One Cup. 

Goodness knows the name has changed enough down the years, but the perception of English football’s second domestic cup has remained largely the same thanks to the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger; a tournament for giving the stars a rest and blooding youngsters.

But everyone has start to somewhere. And as the rest of the Premier League clubs enter the fray at the third round stage, we take a look at the big names who have made their debuts in this competition, and the five stars for the future who could make it big on Tuesday and Wednesday.

David Beckham, seen here celebrating the Champions League semi-final win over Juventus in 1999, made his Manchester United debut in 1992 before cementing himself in the club's history forever

John Terry, a three-time title winner with Chelsea, made his first appearance as a replacement for Dan Petrescu in the 1999 League Cup win over Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge

David Beckham

Age: 17

Debut: Brighton 1-1 Man Utd, Sept 23, 1992

Beckahm made his United debut in front 16,649 fans at the Goldstone Ground – nearly three years before his first league appearance – coming on for the last 17 minutes of a second round Rumbelows Cup tie as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis.

Many years later he recalled: ‘The manager turned to me and said, "Get changed, son, you’re going on". I was so excited I bounced up off my seat and – crack – I hit my head on the dugout!’

Ashley Cole

Age: 18

Debut: Middlesbrough 2-2 Arsenal (3-1 on penalties) Nov 30, 1999

Cole came on for Ray Parlour in the 89th minute of a tie that was heading for extra-time and penalties at the Riverside, Arsenal eventually losing the shootout 3-1.

The future England left back was sent out on loan to Crystal Palace and made his next appearance three months later – at Grimsby.

The League Cup can be the window of opportunity for young stars looking to force a way through into first-team reckoning.

Here are five potential debuts to look out for over the next two nights in the Capital One Cup.

Jordan Rossiter (LIVERPOOL vs Middlesbrough) 

Labelled as a 'potential young Steven Gerrard' by Robbie Fowler, the pressure has been on young Rossiter since he was 15.

The cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well, though, furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for Brendan Rodgers. With Jordan Henderson out, the time might be now for Rossiter to partner Gerrard in the centre.

Tyias Browning (Swansea vs EVERTON)

The highly-rated versatile defender penned a new three-year contract at Everton in the summer, and could make his bow against Swansea.

Able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence, Browning impressed in the Championship on loan at Wigan last season.

Semi Ajayi (ARSENAL vs Southampton) 

More of an unearthed diamond, Ajayi has followed a similar route as Carl Jenkinson in progressing to a possible debut.

Signed from Charlton after a successful trial last year, the 21-year-old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on Calum Chambers' selection.

Sheyi Ojo (LIVERPOOL vs Middlesbrough)

Shot to fame with two goals against West Ham in the Under 21 Premier League earlier this month, and could be an option for Rodgers on the wing against Middlesbrough.

Blessed with blistering pace and Raheem Sterling-like dribbling ability, Liverpool beat the likes of Chelsea to sign the 14-year-old for £2million from MK Dons in 2011.

Sullay Kai-Kai (CRYSTAL PALACE vs Newcastle) 

An immensely talented individual following on from Victor Moses and Wilfried Zaha, Kai-Kai hit a hat-trick for the development side earlier this month.

Got a taste of senior football on loan at Crawley last season, and may be given the chance to shine by Neil Warnock.

John Terry

Age: 17

Debut: Chelsea 4-1 Aston Villa, Oct 28, 1998

Two months before making his first Premier League appearance for Chelsea, Terry came off the bench to replace Dan Petrescu in the 86th minute at Stamford Bridge.

The future England captain, who was voted Chelsea’s Young Player of the Year that season, went on to win the trophy in 2005 and 2007.

Terry has gone on to become a Chelsea legend, 16 years after his first appearance for the club

Robbie Fowler

Age: 18

Debut: Fulham 1-3 Liverpool, Sept 22, 1993

The man who became known simply as ‘God’ at Anfield announced his arrival in Liverpool’s senior side by scoring with a wonderful left-foot volley on his debut at Craven Cottage, the first of 183 strikes for the club.

Amazingly, Fowler followed that up by scoring five in the second leg a fortnight later, becoming one of four players in Liverpool’s history to achieve such a feat.

Robbie Fowler scored on his debut at Craven Cottage in 1993, and scored five in the return leg

Cesc Fabregas

Age: 16

Debut: Arsenal 1-1 Rotherham (9-8 on penalties), Oct 28, 2003

The Spaniard was one of seven debutants in Wenger’s line-up, becoming Arsenal’s youngest ever player at the age of 16 years 177 days.

Fabregas played 85 minutes of a tie that went to extra-time and penalties – the Gunners prevailed 9-8 in a shootout – and went on to become their youngest ever scorer as well when he netted against Wolves in the next round.

Midfielder Cesc Fabregas first entered the fray in 2003 in a draw against Rotherham

Paul Scholes

Age: 19

Debut: Port Vale 1-2 Manchester United, Sept 21, 1994

Scholes celebrated the first of his 718 appearances for United by scoring twice at Vale Park two months before his 20th birthday, the first a cheeky dink over the goalkeeper.

Amazing as it seems now, there was a storm of protest from Vale fans over Ferguson’s decision to send out an under-strength team that also included Beckham, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Keith Gillespie. The local MP even raised the issue in the House of Commons.

Paul Scholes, one of United's greatest ever players, made his debut two years later than Beckham

Jermain Defoe made his debut in the League Cup at Walsall, and scored the winner at the Bescot

Jermain Defoe

Age: 17

Debut: Walsall 0-1 West Ham, Sept 19, 2000

Defoe was one month shy of his 18th birthday when he went on as a 77th-minute substitute at the Bescot Stadium and scored the decisive goal seven minutes later.

‘I remember it was pouring down with rain when I came on,’ he said later. ‘Being 17, I was a bit nervous so my first touch was a pass back. Then on my second touch I just hit a shot on the volley with my left foot and it went. Unbelievable.’ 

Danny Welbeck

Age: 17

Debut: Man Utd 3-1 Middlesbrough, Sept 23, 2008

Welbeck started alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and Nani, playing the full 90 minutes on his debut.

The teenager went on to make four more appearances in the competition that season, including the final at Wembley when United beat Tottenham on penalties.

Danny Welbeck started his Manchester United career with a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough in the League Cup

Wojciech Szczesny

Age: 19

Debut: Arsenal 2-0 West Brom, Sept 22, 2009

The Polish keeper earned his opportunity after impressing in the reserves and rewarded Wenger’s faith by keeping a clean sheet at the Emirates.

But Szczesny still had to go out on loan at Brentford before establishing himself as No 1 at the club.

Wojciech Szczesny was used by Arsene Wenger in the 2-0 in over West Brom at the Emirates Stadium
