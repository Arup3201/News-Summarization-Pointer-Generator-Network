Michael Shrimpton, 57, (pictured) sparked a security scare when he claimed spies were plotting to bomb the Queen  during the 2012 London Olympics

A barrister who sparked a security scare when he claimed German spies were plotting to assassinate the Queen with a nuclear weapon during the 2012 London Olympics has denied he is a ‘fantasist, nutter or liar’.

Michael Shrimpton, 57, allegedly called the House of Commons and the Aylesbury Conservative Association to warn them that a bomb stolen from a sunken Russian submarine had been smuggled into the country and was stashed in an east London hospital.

The lawyer, who had a ‘fascination’ for political and military intelligence, told a close colleague of former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the deadly weapon would be detonated during the 2012 Olympics, Southwark Crown Court heard.

He also bombarded the offices of MP David Lidington with voicemails to repeat his bomb hoax, the jury heard.

Appearing at court today, Shrimpton, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, insisted he was not a compulsive liar and said he was giving a ‘reasoned intelligence briefing from an intelligence specialist’.

‘The idea I was acting in bad faith didn’t occur to me... I thought I was doing something sensible,’ he said.

Shrimpton said he was ‘genuinely concerned’ for the safety of the Games and the Queen ‘for whom I hold deep affection’.

The lawyer denies communicating false information and is representing himself at his trial.

Today, prosecutor Alan Blake asked him: ‘Do you accept lots of people claim to be involved in intelligence but aren’t and lots of them can be fantasists, nutters or liars?’

To which Shrimpton replied: 'Yes'. 

Mr Blake continued: ‘Because mostly when lawyers are dealing with people who claim to have an intelligence connection, normally it is people making things up?

To which Shrimpton replied 'yes' again before adding: ‘I can’t recall when I said them but they are my words.'

The practicing barrister, who has also sat as an immigration judge, later insisted: ‘I tell the truth’.

And he insisted he was not a ‘nutter’, telling jurors he had never suffered from mental health problems and had never been referred to a psychiatrist.

When Mr Blake asked Shrimpton if he was solely responsible for his actions, he replied: ‘Yes. I am the maker of my fate and the captain of my soul.’

Shrimpton, who describes himself as a 'major player', claims to be well connected in international intelligence and defence organisations.

He denied he was a compulsive liar and stressed there was ‘absolutely no point trying to pass duff intelligence’ as it would damage his reputation in the ‘glamourous, exciting area’.

Shrimpton also told the court that he formerly worked on the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance and the case of former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet.

The barrister told a close colleague of former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the deadly weapon, taken from a Russian submarine, would be detonated during the 2012 Games, Southwark Crown Court heard

He read extracts from his address book with a number of ‘contacts’ in the CIA, FBI, MI6, the Pentagon, Chinese intelligence and Parliament.

Shrimpton said: ‘I admit that the stuff I deal with is bound to sound strange, highfalutin, incredible and fantastic.

‘It’s my world, welcome to my world.’

Shrimpton also claims he has previously rubbed shoulders with royalty, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and he listed a number of famous names including Richard Branson and Steven Forbes.

He boasted about possessing the name and number of the private secretary of His Royal Highness Prince Phillip who he said he has met twice in a social context.

Shrimpton also claims he has travelled the world on intelligence assignments and carried a gun into America with permission from the CIA.

He also claims to have the authority to issue a Defence Advisory Notice on behalf of the Government to stop British media from publishing stories that could compromise national security.

He said he wanted to prevent the News of the World from blowing his intelligence, and added they were ‘very cooperative’.

Shrimpton also told the jury that there was an assassination attempt against him by the Chinese authorities who wanted to ‘whack’ him.

Jurors heard how Shrimpton reported that the deadly weapon was going to be used against the Queen, the main stadium or the opening ceremony during the 2012 Olympics. He denied he was a compulsive liar today

He claimed the Los Angeles Sheriff Department also consulted him on possible terror attacks over a cup of coffee.

Jurors heard he passed information about an imminent attack in London to people in high authority when the preparation for the 2012 games was at an ‘advanced stage’.

Shrimpton announced that a nuclear weapon stolen from the sunken Russian submarine, the Kursk, had been smuggled into the UK and was being stored in an east London hospital, it was said.

He first dialled the House of Commons on April 19 and received a call back from Barry Burton who was the principal private secretary to Philip Hammond.

Shrimpton boasted of ‘credible European sources’, name-dropped MPs and said intelligence had been blocked through official channels.

During the 20-minute call with Mr Burton, Shrimpton said he was a lawyer with information about four nuclear warheads that had been removed from a submarine.

One warhead was being held in a hospital to mask its radioactive signals and was going to be used to attack the Olympic Games.

The weapon was going to be used against the Queen, the main stadium or the opening ceremony, jurors heard.

Mr Burton was forced to pass the information to the Olympic security team and the police, despite his suspicions that it was a hoax, it was said.

The next day, Shrimpton rang the Aylesbury Conservative Association and spoke to Sarah Sproat.

He told her he needed to get a message to the MP David Lidington about a nuclear warhead which she then reported to a colleague at parliament, the court heard.

Shrimpton was arrested on suspicion of communicating false information the same day.

He previously admitted leaving the voicemail at the House of Commons but denied making positive statements about a nuclear threat, jurors heard.

Shrimpton claimed the Deutsches Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD) - a reference to ‘a covert and rather sinister’ German agency -had penetrated MI5, MI6 and GHQ.

He allegedly claimed the DVD was responsible for sabotaging the Kursk in 2000 and stealing the nuclear weapons.

The information had initially come from the Russian intelligence agency the GRU, jurors heard.

Shrimpton has been a member of the Aylesbury Conservative Association since he defected from the Labour party in 1997.

He denies two counts of communicating false information with intent.

The trial continues.
