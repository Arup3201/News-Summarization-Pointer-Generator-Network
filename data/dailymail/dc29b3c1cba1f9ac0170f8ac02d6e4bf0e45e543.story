Ever wondered what it's like to be stuck in an avalanche? These incredible photos depict an ice-climber's unfortunate experience in Italy

The ice climber was at 6,000ft in the Italian Alps near Cogne with alpine climbing photographer Jonathan Griffith

Thankfully, the ice climber, who is almost 6,000ft high, manages to hold on and safely makes it through.

The spectacular pictures were taken by alpine climbing photographer, Jonathan Griffith, during a visit to the Alps near Cogne, Italy.

The 31-year-old, from London, set up his camera on a tripod and used a radio control to take the pictures while supporting his friend Jeff Mercier's weight with a rope.

Jonathan watched on as his daring pal took on the climb known as the 'hard ice on the rock,' already knowing that there would be an avalanche.

Though the climber was almost 6 thousand feet high, he managed to hang on and make it safely through the snowfall

At one point Jeff Mercier is complete engulfed by the falling snow and it is not known whether he has managed to hang on

Climbing photographer, Jonathan Griffith, took the photos via a radio control that he set up, while he supported his friend by holding the rope

Only when the snow begins to clear doe sit become apparent that Jeff Brazier is still holding on to the frozen waterfall

Jonathan said: 'It was snowing when we arrived so we knew that avalanches would be coming down.

'Ice climbing is always quite risky, but the shots are nice as they are quite atmospheric.

'It was more like getting a very cold spray of ice and wind rather than anything life threatening.

'Of course that is totally dependent on the snow itself - in this case it fell as light powder so there is not much weight behind it.

'I actually set the camera up on a tripod and had a radio control. 

'It's something I do a fair bit when ice climbing actually as it means I can still climb but get nice 'third person' shots as well.'
