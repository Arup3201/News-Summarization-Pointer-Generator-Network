Barcelona's first team stars looked like they had an extra spring in their step as they put the final touches on preparations for their crucial match against Real Madrid.

Spirits appeared to be high as Lionel Messi, Neymar and Co were put through their paces by Luis Enrique, who sported a pair of black sunglasses during the training session.

Ivan Rakitic netted in the 31st minute to pile misery on the Barclays Premier League champions and ensure Barcelona booked a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Enrique's side would have won by a bigger scoreline if it wasn't for the outstanding Joe Hart.

Messi heaped praise on Hart following his side's progression to the next round: 'He was phenomenal, he stopped everything.

'We have to congratulate him on a great game because he's a fantastic goalkeeper.'

Jordi Alba was thrown in the air during the training session as he celebrated his 26th birthday on Saturday.  

Barcelona are just one point ahead of Real Madrid going into the second El Clasico of the season.

Real defeated Barcelona 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu back in October when Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe and Karim Benzema scored after Neymar's fourth-minute opener.
