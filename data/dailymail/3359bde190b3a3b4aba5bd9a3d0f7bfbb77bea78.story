A mysterious motorist who left his Mercedes 4x4 in a car park for three weeks faces more than £1,200 in fines.

The windscreen of the luxury car is covered in an ever-growing carpet of parking fines.

The car park's owner is now so fed up with the stubborn offender that it has called in the police to help find him.

Abandoned: This luxury 4x4 has been illegally parked at a North London car park for the past three weeks

The 4x4 appears to be an M-Class, worth more than £40,000 new.

It has been parked at a car park in Cockfosters, North London for the past 21 days and has racked up £1,275 in parking fines.

A warning notice on the car threatening to scrap it if it is not removed within 14 days has apparently had no effect.

Complicating the search for the vehicle's owner is the fact that it bears an Irish licence plate.

Expensive: The vehicle has collected a total of £1,275 in parking fines and police are now involved

A spokesman for NCP, which runs the car park, said today: 'It's been there for 21 days so it got to the point where we had to alert the police.

'The main thing is trying to find out if the owners are OK, but if they do return to their car there is going to be a pretty big bill waiting for them.

'It is in the hands of the Met Police now.'
