An online petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign Ched Evans has gained almost 60,000 signatures. 

The former Wales striker was jailed for five years in April 2012 after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman on a night out in Wales. 

But the 25-year-old is due to be released in October having served half his term and is determined to get his career back on track.

Following reports that United - who earlier this year confirmed they were in contact with Evans  - may re-sign the striker, a petition addressed to United chairman Kevin McCabe was started.

It states: 'To even consider reinstating him as a player is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.

'The message is that men who commit such atrocious crimes will suffer only a small penance whilst the women they attack suffer for the rest of their lives. Sheffield United Football Club must not reinforce that message.' 

Meanwhile, Rape Crisis England & Wales said United should think carefully before re-signing Evans.

Director of communications Katie Russell told Sky News: 'It is of course any convicted criminal’s right to serve their sentence and then go back into employment. We absolutely stand by that.

'But at the same time we would urge Sheffield United to think very carefully about the message that they send when they immediately re-employ someone who’s been convicted of such a very serious crime.

'If they choose to do that, which is their right, we urge them to seriously consider the impact that will have on huge numbers of their supporters and we urge them to make a very strong statement condemning sexual violence, condemning violence against women and girls and making it clear that misogyny, sexism, violence and sexual violence in particular won’t be tolerated within football.'

Cleared: Clayton McDonald, in action for Port Vale and now of Tranmere, was found not guilty 

Evans was found guilty of rape after the prosecution argued the girl was too drunk to consent to sex. Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, now of Tranmere Rovers, was cleared of the same charge.

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey has confirmed that he is looking to rebuild his career upon his release. 'All Ched wants to do is go back to work, do the job that he loves, play football, score goals and then just come home and have a family life,' she told Sky News. 

A Sheffield United spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can only reiterate the previous statements we have put out in relation to Ched Evans through the summer.'

In April United confirmed they had been in contact with Evans since his imprisonment. 'The club can confirm that, as part of its ongoing policy of providing a duty of care to former employees and their families, it was in contact with Mr Evans subsequent to his conviction,' they said in a statement.
