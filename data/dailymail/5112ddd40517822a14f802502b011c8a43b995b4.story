 an end.

Commander Chris Hadfield records a cover version of David Bowie's 1969 Space Oddity as a farewell message to Twitter fans. Hadfield has been aboard the International Space Station since December and is due to return to Earth on Tuesday. He has posted stunning photos of space during his five-month stint, and recorded videos showing how astronauts brush their teeth and how to throw up in space

The music video cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity shows Commander Chris Hadfield in various locations around the International Space Station. Hadfield recorded the video as a farewell message before he returns to Earth on Tuesday. When Hadfield tweeted the video, David Bowie replied with: 'Hallo Spaceboy'

Commander Hadfield has built up more than 790,000 followers on Twitter by posting photographs of the Earth from space.

The astronaut wrote on Twitter: 'With deference to the genius of David 
Bowie, here's Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of the 
World.'

David Bowie then replied with: 'Hallo Spaceboy.'

Chris' fellow Canadian, Emm Gryner, who was a part of Bowie's live band in 1999 and 2000 said on her blog:

'I came up with a piano part.

'I then enlisted my friend, producer and fellow Canadian Joe Corcoran to take my piano idea and Chris' vocal and blow it up into a fully produced song.

'We also incorporated into the track ambient space station noises which Chris had put on his Soundcloud.

'I was mostly blown away by how pure and earnest Chris' singing is on this track.

'And voila! An astronaut sings Space Oddity in space! I was so honoured to be asked to be a part of this.

'You wouldn't get too many chances to make a recording like this and not only that, to make music with someone who - through his vibrant communications with kids in schools to his breathtaking photos to his always patient and good-humoured demeanor - has done more for science and space than anyone else this generation.

David Bowie released the original Space Oddity song in 1969, taken from the album of the same name. The album was originally called David Bowie, yet when it was re-released in 1972 it was renamed Space Oddity because of the popularity of the single. The song won the 1969 Ivor Novello Award for Originality

'Planet earth IS blue, and there's nothing left for Chris Hadfield to do. Right. Safe travels home Commander!'

The original Space Oddity was released in 1969, taken from the album of the same name. 

The album was originally called David Bowie, but was changed to Space Oddity in 1972 upon its re-release.

The song won the 1969 Ivor Novello Award for Originality.

Before going into orbit, Commander Hadfield said playing music was important 
in taking care of the 'psychological side' of living in space.

In February he sent a message from space to veteran wildlife broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.

The astronaut asked: 'If you had an evening to spend here on the space station, how would you spend it?'

Sir David replied: 'I'd just sit and watch the Earth go by - it's a perspective I've never had.'

During his time on the Space Station, Hadfield has also posted videos on how to throw up in space, how astronauts brush their teet, and how to make a peanut butter sandwich.

Last week, the team on board the International Space Station took a breathtaking image of the sun beginning to rise over the South Pacific Ocean.

The incredible image was captured by the crew on the station passed a few hundred miles east of Easter Island.

It shows the brightness of the sun and the incredible blue of the atmosphere, and is the latest in a stunning series of pictures captured from the orbiting outpost.

Nasa has not revealed which of the astronauts took the picture, which shows the sun about to come up over the South Pacific Ocean.

'In this 
colorful scene photographed by one of the Expedition 35 crew members 
aboard the Earth-orbiting International Space Station between 4 and 5 
a.m. local time, May 5, 2013, the outpost was at a point above Earth 
located at 27.4 degrees south latitude and 110.1 degrees west longitude,
 a few hundred miles east of Easter Island,' Nasa said in a statement accompanying the picture.

 It is the latest in a stunning series of pictures captured by the current crop of astronauts aboard the orbiting outpost.

Although Nasa has not revealed who took the picture, Canadian Chris Hadfield who has gained a cult following on Twitter for his images of the Earth from space is thought to be a front-runner.

He is set to return to Earth later this month, and has tweeted a series of videos and pictures showing everything from how to cry in space to how astronauts cook.

A previous shot, which bears 
striking resemblance to the beginning of the opening credits of a 
Universal film, was posted last week.

The
 image was shot over southwestern America and will be one of Hadfield's 
last tweets from space after he announced that his return to earth will 
commence later this month.

Commander of the International Space Station, Chris has gained an army of followers on Facebook and Twitter with his daily updates from space which feature beautiful pictures and news on the progress of the various missions he and his colleagues carry out.

Hadfield has been taking the Twitterverse by storm from aboard the ISS, which orbits the Earth at 8km a second, since he arrived back on December 21.

The collection of images he has posted from space feature locations as diverse as San Francisco's glittering lights and breathtaking cloud formations over Africa.

He has also captured large parts of the UK from space including Manchester, London and Bournemouth.

But his latest shot of the US at dawn is perhaps his best post yet.

The astronaut, who has also posted a variety of amusing videos showing what it is like to shave, vomit and brush your teeth in space, uses a long lens camera to capture the stunning detail of the Earth.

Among his favourite places to photograph is the Sahara in Africa and he explains that he waits until the sun is directly over the desert to get the best shot.

He says: 'The beauty of space station, though, is if it's not here this time, tomorrow it might be, or maybe a month from now.

'There's not a race to get a picture. You can be patient, like a hunter.'

He says that it’s not Instagram, it’s 'Space-a-gram' and that the key steps are: 'Focus, frame, and fire'.

He added: 'We orbit 400km above the earth, so if you want to get a good detailed picture of something you need a long lens. I have one velcroed to the wall.’

Chris uses a special setting on his camera to deal with the bright glare of light from the Earth against the pitch black backdrop of space.

He takes pictures in as high a resolution as possible, so his camera's memory card gets full very quickly.

The first Canadian to walk in space, Commander Hadfield, 53, a former air force fighter pilot, has previously flown two Space Shuttle missions in 1995 and 2001.

Hadfield has amassed 226,000 fans on Facebook and 740,000 followers on Twitter.

He announced that his 'fiery fall' to earth will commence on May 13 after the arrival of a new Russian commander.
