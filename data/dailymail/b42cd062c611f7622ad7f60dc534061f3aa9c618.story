A young girl with leukemia and a heart catheter, known only as Emily, could die in
a matter of days if she is not brought back to an Arizona hospital after her
parents inexplicably took her out of the facility last week, authorities said today.

Phoenix police are stymied by health laws that prevent them
from releasing the family's name, but they're asking anyone with information
about their whereabouts to come forward.

The 11-year-old girl authorities are only calling Emily had
been receiving chemotherapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital for about a month,
said Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos.

Last sighting: Leukemia patient Emily is seen with her mother on Phoenix Children's Hospital CCTV

Putting a stop to treatment: Emily's mother removed a IV drip from a catheter in her heart and helped her change clothes before leading her out of the hospital

An infection forced doctors to amputate her right arm and
insert a catheter in her heart. The device was set to be taken out before her
mother removed an IV from the girl, changed her clothes, and walked her out of
the hospital Wednesday night.

Police said if the catheter is left in too long, it could
lead to a deadly infection.

'If she contracts an infection, it really could just be a
matter of days that could result in the young girl's death,' Martos said. 'It's
pretty serious.'

Authorities know the family's identity, but cannot release
their names due to privacy laws. Martos said neither parent is charged with a
crime yet, but authorities want the child brought back to the hospital before
it's too late.

Martos said the family lives a 'nomadic' life without a
permanent residence, but they have relatives in Arizona, California and Mexico,
none of whom have been able to provide police with information about their
whereabouts.

Leaving early: The 11-year-old, pictured with her mother and a young boy, was not to leave hospital until later this week

Concerns: Doctors are worried Emily could die from an infection of the heart within a few days if the catheter is not medically removed

The girl's father is a Mexican citizen with a U.S. resident
alien identification card. The child and her mother are U.S. citizens, Martos
said.

Phoenix Children's Hospital spokeswoman Jane Walton declined
to comment, citing health privacy laws.

Authorities don't know why the child's parents took her from
the hospital, but speculate they might have been concerned with paying the
bill.

Surveillance footage from Wednesday night shows the mother
pushing an IV stand through a hospital hallway.

The young girl with her right
arm removed above the elbow and wrapped in a bandage is seen walking beside
her.

'We just don't know what their intent was,' Martos said.
'But this could become extremely serious if she contracts an infection ... Our primary
concern is she get the proper medical care so we can prevent obviously the
worst case scenario here.'

Missing: The group left the hospital in a black Ford on Wednesday night and Emily hasn't been seen since
