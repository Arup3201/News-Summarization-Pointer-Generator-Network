It was a decade ago that John Terry, who has captained Chelsea 528 times, first learned the tricks of the role under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho.

After impressing Mourinho upon inheriting the armband from Marcel Desailly, the manager wanted to see Terry evolve from a very good centre half into a great captain, using his profile to control games and influence decisions in the way Roy Keane, Patrick Vieira and Alan Shearer did.

Like them, Terry proved quite an expert. It is partly why he has been one of English football’s most successful modern captains and why Fabio Capello risked — and lost — his job trying to restore him as England skipper.

It is also why Mourinho has promised another one-year deal to the defender, who turns 35 this year.

Terry understands what his manager wants. This includes turning the heat on officials, as he did on Wednesday against Paris Saint-Germain when he led nine excited team-mates in pursuit of referee Bjorn Kuipers to ensure Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off.

Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona knew how to exaggerate fouls, pressure the referee and cultivate their reputation as the team most sinned against. Mourinho and PSG midfielder Thiago Motta discovered this when they were at Inter Milan. No-one can make slight contact appear quite as painful as Sergio Busquets.

Chelsea went close up with Barca at times, including the nights when Tom Henning Ovrebo found infamy and Terry was sent off for kicking Alexis Sanchez and banned for the Champions League final.

Everyone is at it, as Terry said. Everyone always has been, to some degree. But Chelsea always manage to offend. Even when there is much to admire about them.

Graeme Souness claimed it’s ‘not the British way’ but traditional sporting integrity has faded from view. Winning matters more than ever. Managers find ways to do it.

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic grabs Everton's James McCarthy around the neck last month

Wednesday’s snarling exit from Europe epitomised Chelsea from the first Mourinho era: winning ugly and losing badly. This was one of the issues which drove owner Roman Abramovich and Mourinho apart in the first place.

There are differences this time but the defining image of the second leg against PSG is the latest in a series of skirmishes.

Last month, Branislav Ivanovic grabbed Everton’s James McCarthy by the throat as Chelsea swarmed around referee Jon Moss in reaction to a tackle by Gareth Barry, which also led to a red card. Both teams were fined £30,000 by the FA for failing to control their players and Chelsea were warned about surrounding the referee.

Last month, Diego Costa was banned for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can during a physical Capital One Cup semi-final. There were flashes last season: two red cards at Aston Villa and touchline eruptions featuring Mourinho and Rui Faria.

More recently, Nemanja Matic was dismissed for pushing Ashley Barnes over. The tackle by Barnes was bad and sparked a furious reaction from those in blue, who rushed Martin Atkinson. Ivanovic grabbed his hand to stop him raising the red card.

Others deploy such tactics — Angel di Maria was sent off for pulling the referee’s shirt on Monday in a game where Wayne Rooney seemed joined to Michael Oliver — but Chelsea are perhaps the most committed.

The Sky Sports pundits were scathing of Chelsea's 'pathetic' behaviour at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday

At the slightest contact in the penalty area, they hit the deck and if the appeals are rejected the ensuing mass protest can feature half-a-dozen people fuming on the touchline. Repeat to build pressure.

If there is a fierce tackle, the victim exaggerates the pain, while the team swarm around the referee. Some sprint half the length of the pitch to create panic and cloud the referee’s judgment. Get enough around the ref and he has no idea who said what or who to book. It creates panic.

Call it protection for Eden Hazard, who has been kicked a lot. Call it a protection racket.

Under Premier League rules Chelsea would probably have been charged with failing to control their players, who constantly surrounded the referee on Wednesday. Fortunately for them, no such action exists under UEFA rules.

Jose Mourinho, questioning a decision with the officials, saw his Chelsea side crash out of Europe

Mourinho muddies it all with his quotability and media strategy, always seeking to gain a small advantage, which can be vital at the rarefied end of European competition where teams are so tightly matched that each big decision is magnified in importance.

Perhaps it is a by-product of the arrogance the best teams need, because Arsenal and Manchester United over-stepped the mark when they ruled the roost.

Mourinho’s first spell at the Bridge was littered with on-field confrontations and associated fines.

He had been sacked but the tone was still set when, in March 2008, Ashley Cole turned his back as he was booked by Mike Riley and the FA rolled out their Respect campaign, intended for the grassroots game, in the Premier League too.

It might be time to rekindle the spirit of the Respect campaign, because seven years is a long time in football and unlike the words of wisdom from Mourinho into JT’s shell-like, many of the basic points have been forgotten.
