Hundreds gathered in New York City to attend a memorial for tech pioneer Aaron Swartz, where he was remembered for being an icon for the internet era and not a criminal facing numerous felony charges.

According to the Associated Press,
the memorial, held at New York's Cooper Union, had several high-profile
speakers who re-affirmed their support for Swartz's work.

Perhaps the most emotional tribute for Swartz came from Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, his girlfriend, who was also the first to discover his body. She reflected on him taking his own life, saying 'I'm so sad we'll never see all the ways he'll change the world from here on out.'

Stinebrickner-Kauffman's eulogy did not shy away from criticizing the role the government played in Swartz's suicide. 'He faced a deeply dysfunctional criminal justice system, one that he is far from the only victim of.'

In reference to the prosecutor overseeing the case on behalf of the U.S. Attorney's office, she said he was 'hell-bent on destroying [Swartz's] life.'

In the days following Swartz's death, a number of members from the internet elite poured in their sentiments about his work with online transparency and it created a national dialogue about what should be free on the internet.

Edward Tufte, a professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale, also spoke on Saturday. He was an admirer of Swartz, and following his death he wrote on Twitter, 'Heartbreaking news that my dear friend Aaron Swartz has died at 26. Imaginative, smart about everything, and, best of all, different.' 

Showing how Swartz's work resonated outside the internet community, the memorial also featured a performance from Damien Kulash, a member of the pop group OK Go.

Swartz, 26,
killed himself on January 11, just a month before he was set to go on 
trial in Boston for thirteen felony charges. A maximum sentence would 
have carried decades in prison and huge fines.

Prosecutors
contended that Swartz had broken into the computer database at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 2010 in order to 
access the scholarly website JSTOR, which is pay-access. He was indicted in July the following year.

The Boston-based U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, Carmen Ortiz, when asked previously about the charges filed against Swartz noted that  'stealing is stealing.'

Following the news of Swartz's death Ortiz seemed shaken, even close to crying, when talking to reporters. Though she said that the U.S. Attorney's office was 'terribly upset about what happened,' the case was handled fairly

Many are still questioning if the prosecutors went too far in their case against Swartz. The scrutiny will likely continue as memorials for Swartz go on around the country.

When talking about the future of online freedom, Stinebrickner-Kauffman expressed some positivity, saying, 'Out of today phoenixes are already rising from [Swartz's] ashes.

Earlier this week Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) posted a proposal for an amendment to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act onto Reddit.'We should prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users.' It is currently called 'Aaron's Law.' Prior to co-founding Reddit, Swartz was 
instrumental in creating RSS, a streaming system that gathers updates 
from blogs, news organizations, and other sites around the internet. He 
was also a co-founder for Demand Progress, a group devoted to stopping 
online censorship.
