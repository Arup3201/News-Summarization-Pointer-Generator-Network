Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed the loan signing of Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha and the permanent transfer for his Old Trafford team-mate Fabio.

Zaha had a medical at St George's Park ahead of the move in the week, while Brazilian Fabio's contract expires this summer and he does not figure in David Moyes' plans after making just one Premier League appearance all season. 

Sportsmail believe Zaha's loan fee is 
between £1million and £1.5m, with Cardiff picking up the 
midfielder's £35,000-a-week wages.

Solskjaer is believed to have agreed a minimal fee for Fabio's services in order to sign him now rather than for free in July.

The Cardiff manager said: 'My phone is ringing and I am answering most of them. Maybe some players will go out on loan, but we are done with signings. 

'Some players I have looked at and some have not come through. I can’t confirm or deny anybody.

'We have added three new players this week - Fabio, Kenwyne (Jones) and Wilf. They have energy and enthusiasm and presence - together they complement my squad and I am happy with what I have now.

'I am done and thinking about the game. Norwich is far more important than players ins and outs at other clubs - I am focused on game.

'It has been a tough month but I’ve seen great developments in the month. The new players might be what we’ve been lacking.'
