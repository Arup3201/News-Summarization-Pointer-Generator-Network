Poor old Muchelney. From more than a mile away you could easily see the tower of St Peter and St Paul church, and even through the driving rain, the ancient stone houses were visible all around it.

If only you could get to them. But yesterday, surrounded by flood water up to 10ft deep, this little Somerset village was facing its fourth day as a reluctant island community.

On one side of the torrent, spectators gathered at a shoreline that shouldn’t have been a shoreline, gazing in wonder. On the other, it transpired, bored, stranded residents paced the streets, went to each other’s houses for tea or simply sat and waited for help from the mainland. And waited, and waited.

Waders on: Paul Harris in the village of Muchelney on the Somerset levels which was cut off by flooding

Yesterday I paddled a canoe to the newly formed Isle of Muchelney (population, 210), which has been virtually cut off from the outside world and is angry that it has had to endure its second Biblical-style flood in a year after nine disaster-free centuries.

A small white hatchback was just visible beneath the waves; some ducks landed beside the top of two 30mph signs poking up from what used to be a main road into Muchelney. Not that many homes here are actually underwater.

It is lapping at the doorsteps of a few and seeping up through the flagstones, and even yesterday, when the sun came out after a torrential downpour, it revealed that the water level was still creeping up.

But the name of the village derives from the Saxon for ‘great island’ – and that’s exactly what Muchelney has become. ‘You just can’t get anywhere,’ said 66-year-old Mervyn Slade, pedalling his bike around the new shoreline. I’ve done a whole circuit and I’ve only covered about a mile and a half. I reckon it will be two weeks before you’ll be able to drive a car out of here.’

Concerns: The water levels in the village are said to be creeping up, despite the fact the sun was out yesterday

Behind him as he spoke, the Saxon and 15th century church was opening its doors as a centre for dropping off free food and provisions. One man arrived by tractor to collect a few supplies; a woman left with some cans of dog food and two bottles of water.

‘Everything we’ve done here we’ve done on our own,’ said Louise, 29, walking two Yorkshire terriers with husband Paul and mother Angela. ‘We’ve been left to fend for ourselves. Apart from the people who dropped off sandbags, we haven’t seen one official here.’

There is widespread criticism locally of the Environment Agency’s flood prevention and water management strategies. Paul told me: ‘When this place was built, monks from the abbey dug the ditches by hand and kept them clear so the water was channelled away. Since then the rivers have become silted up – they haven’t been dredged properly for about 20 years.’

Warning: The sign altering residents to flooding seems to have done little to prevent the disruption

Enclosed: Stone walls surrounding fields and farmland managed to contain the flow of rain water

Nearby, but across a vast swathe of water, Ian and Jane Birrell were among the unlucky ones.

Their house was ‘tanked’ after the December  flood – waterproofed on the ground floor – but the wet stuff was still finding a way in yesterday.

A baby grand piano that Ian spent £7,000 refurbishing was raised on axle stands in what used to be the lounge. Meanwhile the only music was the sound of electric motors struggling to pump out water as about 2ft of it slopped against stone walls and sandbagged doors.

Jane, 60, somehow gave the appearance of chirpiness amid all the chaos, but admitted she had ‘done a lot of crying’ these last few days.What was the name of their house, I asked? She looked briefly out of the window. ‘Watersmeet,’ she said, and smiled.

Struggle: Villagers have been left to fend for themselves with most of the surrounding main roads being blocked by rain water

Strong winds: The storm conditions which battered the UK damaged a Victorian shelter in Aberystwyth, Wales

Caution: Around 360 flood warnings or alerts have been put in place for England, Wales and Scotland, with three severe warnings in Dorset
