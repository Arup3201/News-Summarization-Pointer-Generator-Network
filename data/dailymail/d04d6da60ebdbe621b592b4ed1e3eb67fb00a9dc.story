Justin Bieber's private plane has been held at a New Jersey airport and police have searched it because it allegedly smelled like marijuana.

The latest updates reported that the 20-year-old and all other passengers on the plane have been released from police custody after a search found no drugs on the plane.

It had been previously reported that the pop star and his father were headed to New Jersey today for the Super Bowl from Canada after hiring a private jet.

The plane has now been spotted at Teterboro airport, which is commonly used for private flights, but 20-year-old Justin nor his father have been allowed off the aircraft.

False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and Bieber and his entourage were free to go

In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs

The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board.

According to a TMZ report, the singer was flagged by US. Customs officials upon landing in New Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his native Canada. 

Though it has not been confirmed that Bieber was on the plane that was being searched, the travel timeline aligns with the singer's schedule.

News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star.On Wednesday, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault.

TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up.

The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

The driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times.

He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case.

A preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication.

Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California

His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday.

Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption.

'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superehero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo.

In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage. If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case.
