This is the moment a Palestinian demonstrator was struck in the face with a tear-gas canister fired by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank after he allegedly threw stones at their armoured vehicle.

Mustafa Tamimi, 28, died of his wounds on Saturday and yesterday the Israeli army faced backlash after a senior military spokesman was accused of mocking him on Twitter.

As mourners attended Tamimi's funeral in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh yesterday, the spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Major Peter Lerner, tweeted: 'What was Mustafa thinking running after a moving jeep while throwing stones #fail.'

Killed: Palestinian Mustafa Tamimi died after being struck in the face with the canister

His tweet follows an unapologetic response from other Israeli military officials, who released the images of a sling that they allege was found on Tamimi's body - apparently proving that he had shot stones at the soldiers.

Further pictures were released of the demonstrator's body lying in a pool of blood after the incident, before he was taken to hospital where he later died of his injuries.

Despite Major Lerner denying mocking Tamimi, saying the word 'fail' was directed at activists who gave a one-sided version of events, clashes erupted at the victim's funeral.

The term 'fail' is US slang, meaning extreme stupidity in a derogatory sense, and is a popular term used on the internet.

Israeli soldiers fired tear gas at 
Tamimi's mourners, who were trying to march on a spring near Nabi Saleh,
leaving five people injured, the Daily Telegraph reported.         

After
a hospital spokesperson revealed that Tamimi had died from his 
injuries, an Israeli military spokeswoman said the demonstrators had 
'hurled rocks at (Israeli) security forces who responded with riot 
dispersal means' and that an investigation into the incident was 
underway.

Tamimi was treated at a hospital in central Israel, where he died early on Saturday, a spokeswoman said.           

Stone-throwing clashes have become a 
weekly occurrence at fixed flashpoints along the route of the West Bank 
barrier, which Palestinians condemn as a land grab.    

Israel
started building the network of metal fencing, barbed wire and concrete
walls in 2002 following a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in its 
cities.            

The
World Court in The Hague said in 2004 the barrier was illegal, citing 
its route inside territory that Israeli forces occupied in a 1967 war.
