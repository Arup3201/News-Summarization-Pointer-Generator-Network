Federal authorities have launched a major investigation into the handling of at least two alleged rapes at the University of Southern California after students filed a 107-page complaint.

The U.S. Department of Education has opened a Title IX sex discrimination investigation into allegations made by more than a dozen USC students who claimed the school did not take appropriate action after reporting sexual abuse to college officials, which violated their civil rights, according to ABC News. 

One of the more shocking cases involved a woman who was allegedly told by campus police that her rape report was groundless because the assailant did not orgasm.

'Because he stopped, it was not rape,' the student was allegedly told by a Department of Public Safety detective, according to the complaint.

'Even though his penis penetrated your vagina, because he stopped, it was not a crime.'

The complaint says the woman's case was consequently not referred to the Los Angeles Police Department.

Tucker Reed, 23, who is a theater major at USC, says her ex-boyfriend raped her in December 2010. When she took her claims to university officials in December 2012, she said her case was not properly investigated

Ariella Mostov said officials ignored her claims that she was sexually assaulted and that afterwards, she was forced to attend classes with the suspect for an entire semester

Several students behind the complaint held a press conference earlier this week to talk about their cases. 

'The process made me feel raped a second time,' said Tucker Reed, 23, who is a theater major at USC.

Reed says her ex-boyfriend raped her in December 2010. When she took her claims to university officials in December 2012, she said her case was not properly investigated and that it was eventually dismissed.

She says she had presented detectives with evidence of the assault, including a recording in which her alleged attacker admitted to the crime.

Another student, Ariella Mostov, 21, said

semester.

'USC was unwilling to make any accommodations for me,' she said, her voice shaking with emotion. 'I was outraged.'

When another student went to the school's Department of Public Safety to report a sexual assault at a fraternity event, an officer told her and a friend that women should not 'go out, get drunk and expect not to get raped,' according to the complaint.

The federal investigation is the latest in a series of inquiries into whether colleges are complying with the guidelines of Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

Similar complaints have been filed against other schools around the nation, including Occidental College, UC Berkeley, Dartmouth, Swarthmore and Yale.
