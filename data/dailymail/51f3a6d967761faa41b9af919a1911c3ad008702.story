Kit Symons could move a step closer to landing the permanent Fulham manager's job with victory over Charlton on Friday.

Symons has guided the Cottagers to four wins from seven matches since taking over on a caretaker basis from the sacked Felix Magath last month.

Chairman Shahid Khan has a five-man committee to advise him over the club's next managerial appointment, with names such as Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke thought to be on the shortlist along with Symons.

Former Norwich manager Chris Hughton (above) has also been linked with the vacancy at the London club 

But while Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Co mull over the options, Symons has quietly gone about transforming a side who had collected just one point from their previous seven Sky Bet Championship games under Magath.

One player benefiting from the former Fulham defender's spell in charge is Dan Burn, whose late equaliser secured a dramatic 3-3 draw at Rotherham on Tuesday.

The 22-year-old told the club website: "We just had the desire to at least come away with something. We took a point - yes, we wanted it to be three, but it wasn't a defeat so it means we can build on that going into the Charlton game on Friday.

"You can't keep getting a win, a defeat, a win, a defeat - you've got to keep the momentum going so it's really important we didn't get a defeat on Tuesday. We've got a lot of games coming up, so hopefully we can carry on."

Symons will hand a late fitness check to defender Tim Hoogland, who missed out in midweek through illness, while captain Scott Parker will return to the starting line-up to face his old club.

A point would lift Fulham out of the relegation zone for the first time this season, while Charlton are looking for a win which would move them to within a point of leaders Derby.

But Addicks boss Bob Peeters is well aware of the stark contrast between Magath's confidence-drained team and the in-form side he will face at Craven Cottage.

"I saw them in one of the last games under Felix Magath, (a 1-0 defeat) at home to Wolves, and at that time they were struggling, there was no mentality, nothing in the team," he said.

"Then I saw them against Bolton at home and it was another team completely - they won 4-0. So it's going to be a very tough night for us, especially because it's a proper derby."

The visitors will be without suspended midfielder Yoni Buyens, while winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson and six-goal top scorer Igor Vetokele are injury doubts.
