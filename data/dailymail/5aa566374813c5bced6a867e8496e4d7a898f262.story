Liverpool's players were letting the train take the strain as they enjoyed a little bit of shut eye on the way down to London.

But Martin Skrtel and Co might think again when Jose Enrique is around. The left back uploaded pictures of Dejan Lovren, Skrtel and Lazar Markovic sleeping accompanied with the caption 'Never sleep in the train my friends hahahaha'.

Enrique also posted a snap of himself posing for a picture with his 'usual friend' with Suso.

Martin Skrtel, who could return to Liverpool's starting line-up this weekend, was also getting some shut-eye

Brendan Rodgers' side take on West Ham on Saturday in a game they will be hoping to win after falling to a shock home league defeat against Aston Villa last weekend.

Liverpool got back to winning ways on Tuesday when they narrowly beat Ludogorets 2-1 in the Champions League thanks to a late Steven Gerrard penalty.

Rodgers will again be without star striker Daniel Sturridge, however the Liverpool boss has received a timely boost as Skrtel has been declared fit to return to action following a knee injury.
