The Beast made Spain's provisional 30-man squad but he has been overlooked for Fernando Torres.

Manchester City team-mate Jesus Navas also misses out, but fellow Blue David Silva makes the final 23.

Atletico Madrid's strike duo of David Villa and Diego Costa will both travel to Brazil after the latter proved his fitness following a hamstring injury.

Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Juan Mata are both included, with Manchester United's record signing tweeting his delight over his inclusion as Spain head to Brazil looking to defend their world title.

He said: 'Couldn't be happier! Very proud to be in the squad! Let's try to make history again! #WorldCup #Brasil 2014.'

Torres,
 30, scored from the penalty spot in Spain's 2-0 friendly win over 
Bolivia yesterday but he also had a horror miss when he ballooned a shot
 over the bar.

The striker
 timed his run impeccably to latch on to an exquisite Andres Iniesta 
through ball and, with just the keeper to beat, looked certain to score.

However,
 attempting to delicately chip the ball over the head of Bolivia stopper 
Romel Quininez with the outside of his boot, Torres instead sent the 
ball high and wide in the opposite direction.

Torres immediately put his hands to his head after completely misdirecting the ball.

The
 Chelsea attacker has struggled for form having signed for the Blues in a
 Â£50million deal from Liverpool back in January 2011.

Missing out: The Beast started the season superbly for Man City but has been overlooked for Spain's squad

Break: Negredo will go on holiday before reporting back for City's pre-season training at the start of July

Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Pepe Reina (Napoli), David De Gea (Manchester United)

Defenders: Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Raul Albiol (Napoli), Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid), Jordi Alba (Barcelona)

Midfielders: Xavi (Barcelona), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Santi Cazorla (Arsenal), Koke (Atletico Madrid), Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich)

Forwards: David Silva (Manchester City), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid), Fernando Torres (Chelsea), Pedro (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Manchester United), David Villa (Atletico Madrid)
