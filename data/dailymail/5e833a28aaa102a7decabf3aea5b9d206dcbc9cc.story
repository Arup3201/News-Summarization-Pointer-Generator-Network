Have trouble wrapping your head around Bill Gates' $77.5 billion fortune? An eye-opening new map that pairs the wealth of America's billionaires with the cities they could outright purchase gives some perspective.

For $76.5 billion, the Microsoft mogul could outright purchase all 114,212 single-family home, condo and townhouse in the City of Boston.

Real estate brokerage Redfin has crunched the numbers from Forbes' 400 Wealthiest List and towns from coast to coast to answer the question: Which billionaire could buy your city?

Which billionaire could buy YOUR city? Real estate brokerage Redfin has put together an eye-opening map that pairs America's billionaire's the the U.S. cities where their wealth could outright purchase every house, condo and townhome

If you're a denizen of Seattle, the largest city on the list, the answer is which billionaires--plural.

The combined wealth of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton's surviving family members is a staggering $154.8 billion.

Even more staggering? The Waltons could hypothetically purchase all 241,450 homes in Seattle for $111.5 billion and still have more than the GDP of Lebanon left over.

The retail heirs could also have their choice of Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas or the nation's capital--Washington, DC.

Another wealthy family comes just below the Waltons on Redfin's list, the oil baron Koch Brothers.

Charles and David could use their $86 billion to buy Atlanta, Georgia's 286,629 single-family homes.

Bill Gates and Boston are next, followed by Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Warren Buffet.

Seattle: The combined wealth of the Walton Family (pictured is Rob Walton), heirs to Sam Walton's Wal-Mart retail fortune, is $154.8 billion and could purchase all 241,450 homes in Seattle

Atlanta: The oil baron Koch Brothers' billions would allow them to purchase every home in Atlanta

Boston: Bill Gates could personally use his $77.5 billion to buy Beantown

Charlotte: Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffet could easily buy the town of his nickname but could also raise his aim to the Queen City of Charlotte, North Carolina

Anaheim: New York's former mayor Michael Bloomberg likely couldn't afford the Big Apple, but he could buy all 69,167 homes in sunny Anaheim, California with his $31.8 billion

Boca Raton: Google big wig Larry Page could certainly buy his home turf of Mountain View, California. But he could also go in for every home in Boca Raton, Florida for an estimated $29.5 billion

But the 
Oracle of Omaha's $63.5 billion could buy far more than the Nebraska 
city. Buffet could easily purchase Charlotte, North Carolina and have 
$4.4 billion to spare.

New
 York City's former mayor Michael Bloomberg may not be able to afford 
the town he once presided over, but he could easily snag all the homes 
in sunny Anaheim, California.

Google
 top dog Larry Page could easily afford his home turf Mountain View, 
California. But for a few billion more--$29.5 billion--he could have 
Boca Raton, California.

Another
 from the Sillicon Valley elite, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg could buy 
all of Saint Paul, Minnesota's 139,124 homes for $26.8 billion of his 
$27.7 billion fortune.

Others
 on the list include Jeff Bezos (Napa, California), Phil Knight (Falls 
Church, Virginia), and Rupert Murdoch (Peoria, Arizona), among two dozen
 others.

Redfin
 came to their figures for the worth of cities' homes by using figures 
from home sales over the last year on which to base their estimate. 'If 
10 percent of homes sold in a city for $1 billion, then we'd estimate 
the values of all homes in the city are $10 billion,' reads their 
methodology.
