A Japanese taxi driver with a fetish for women on the verge of wetting themselves has been arrested for plying female customers with biscuits laced with diuretics, then watching them squirm in his rear-view mirror.

Toshihiko Nishi, 41, got sexual thrills from watching women desperate to urinate and found his job as a cab driver the perfect way to feed his fixation, police in the city of Osaka claim.

He allegedly lured women into long rides in his cab - sometimes with the offer of a half-price fare - and then offered them crackers covered in a substance that would make them want to go to the toilet, AFP reported.

'I got excited by watching women 
trying to withstand the urge to urinate,' the driver told investigators.
 'I bought diuretics through the Internet, and crushed them to mix with 
crackers.'

When police raided his home, they even found videos of around 50 women wetting themselves on his back seat that he had covertly recorded with the security camera fitted in his cab.

One alleged victim told police she had
 got into Nishi's taxi in Osaka, western Japan, in October last year, 
and been given a small paper cup containing water biscuits.

A short time after eating the snack, she began to need the toilet. But when she told the driver to let her out of the car so she could relieve herself, he refused and instead passed back an absorbent sheet on which he encouraged her to urinate.

Nishi has been arrested on suspicion of committing a violent act, a police officer said.
