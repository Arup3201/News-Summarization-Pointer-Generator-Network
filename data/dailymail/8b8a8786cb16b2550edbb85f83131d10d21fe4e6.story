They are the strays that spend their lives on the streets in Gambia, with nobody to care for them.

But thankfully this six-week-old puppy is given the care it needs after concerned passers-by spotted that it was riddled with parasites.

In a disturbing video filmed by a charitable veterinary clinic, the distressed animal is seen whimpering as it has hundreds of worms squeezed from under its skin.

The video was filmed by the  organisation Animal Care Gambia after holidaymaker Dr. Michael Meyer, from Berlin, realised there were no facilities to look after them and set up a veterinary surgery in 2009.

The puppy was brought it after a German ex-pat spotted it on the streets of Sukuta and realised it needed treatment.

Mangoworm infestations, caused by the mango fly laying eggs and larvae growing under the skin of animals, is a key problem in Gambia.

This young visitor in particular was lucky to be picked up by the caring vets, after becoming riddled with thousands of the maggots. 

Squeezing out the worms, measuring between 3-4mm in diameter, the vet films the procedure as the puppy whimpers in the background.

The larvae of the  parasite, known by its scientific name Cordylobia Anthropophaga, settle under the skin of hosts, both animal and human, and grow there until they can emerge and drop off.

With one woman counting in the background, the video shows 50 worms being squeezed from the distressed puppy's leg in the space of just a couple of minutes.

The vet then moves on to release more worms from the puppy's stomach and other legs. 

The veterinary surgery told MailOnline: 'They are very common in Gambia, every dog and gets them sooner or later. 

The puppy is estimated to be six weeks old and was found on the streets of the Greater Banjul Area

'Usually the infestation is not bad, adult dogs can stand up to 100 maggots without being seriously affected. You will see/feel a lump under the skin and have to squeeze it out once the maggot is 3-4mm in diameter. To squeeze before won't work as the maggot has spikes and holds on to its host.'

The surgery spokesperson goes on to explain: 'They have to come out, that's the only way. Either when they are ready and fully developed by themselves, or by the owner/caretaker before that.

'The problem is that owner/caretaker often does not give a sh** or does not exist, we have a huge amount of dogs on the streets of the Gambia. That's my main work.'

The vat can be heard explaining that removing parasites is one of the most common jobs he performs

The charitable veterinary surgery aims to educate and raise money to tackle issues in Gambia by uploading the videos to YouTube, where the surgeons and assistants have a loyal group of followers.

Commenting under the video, which has had more than four million views, animal lovers worry about the outcome for the young dog.

A user called Angel Isthyname wrote: 'Poor puppy I'm crying hearing his pain squeals.'

Keenan Lee added: 'Really wish they had a follow up story on this puppy. Hope the little guy made it and found a good home.'

The poor puppy is just one of many that is brought in to the surgery by concerned holidaymakers

The veterinary charity explains on its website: 'We are a group of like minded people, concerned with the welfare of beach and street animals in The Gambia. 

'We are based in The Greater Banjul Area of The Gambia which is the most densely populated area with many tourists visiting during the season – October to April.'
