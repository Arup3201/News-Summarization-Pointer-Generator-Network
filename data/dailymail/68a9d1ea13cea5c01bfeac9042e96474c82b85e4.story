As the UK is revealed as the sixth biggest wine consuming country in the world, there can be no doubt that we are a nation who enjoys a glass of Shiraz in the evening.

But how can you indulge in just a glass of your favourite drink without wasting a whole bottle? Stick a condom on it.

The 'wine condom' is the invention - currently in its early stages - of a mother and son entrepreneurial team from Texas. 

Inventor Mitchell Strahan holds the 'Wine Condom' which looks exactly like a black regular prophylactic

Mitchell and Laura Strahan are appealing for backers to help them launch their crafty invention into mainstream retail.

Looking like a black regular prophylactic, the wine condom rolls onto the top of the bottle in the same way as its namesake.

Designed to keep your booze fresh and protected without the additional height that most wine stoppers add (which irritatingly stops the bottle fitting in the fridge), the wine condom can also be carried easily for those who like to be prepared.

Described on the funding website kickstart.com as 'convenient, disposable and hilarious' the condoms will be sold in boxes of 25 or 10.

However, if your concern is less fridge space and more getting your wine stolen by a thirsty housemate or family member, then you might be better placed buying a combination padlock for your bottle.

The lock is a bottle stop with an easy to set four digit combination code to help keep your drink safe.

Made by Whisk Hampers, each steel lock costs £15, which if you regularly see your beloved bottle pillaged by liquor thieves is a sound investment.

And if you are a stickler for keeping your wine at the right temperature, or just want to impress fellow drinkers with your stylish ways, then another unusual accessory is an icicle bottle stopper.

Made from a thermal gel that's completely sealed inside the icicle shape, this clever gadget will retain its temperature far longer than ice and won't dilute the alcohol.
