A social worker in Philadelphia has won the fourth-largest prize ever given by the Pennsylvania state lottery and hightailed it out of her Upper Darby neighborhood.

Patricia Chandler won the jackpot of $131.5 million in the Powerball on June 22. Officials said yesterday that she has stepped forward to claim her prize, which she elected to receive as a $77.4 million one-time payout.

Reporters seeking comment from Chandler about her big win were out of luck, though, as neighbors say they haven't seen Chandler in weeks.

'Do you know why we're here?' a Fox News reporter asked a woman in a car.

'No. I want to know,' she said.

'Your neighbor just won $131 million,' he informed her.

'WHAT?!' squeaked the neighbor in shock.

'Pat, call me!' she said to the camera. 'You know me!'

Chandler bought the winning ticket at Federal Beer on the corner of 15th and Federal Streets in Point Breeze. Her place of work, a non-profit called Programs Employing People, is just down the road.

But Chandler wasn't to be found there, either, as she has reportedly quit her job.

Another neighbor, Tanya Crew, from Chandler's Upper Darby neighborhood said she rarely sees Chandler.

I've seen her once or twice and I've lived here for four years,' said Crew.

'Wow, I'm so happy for her,' she said.

'Hopefully she'll give me a call so she can buy a new house! Tanya Crew the realtor for you, girl, if you're listening!' she said.

Chandler’s ticket correctly matched all five white balls, 13-19-23-33-57, and the red Powerball, 28, to win a prize of a $131.5 million annuity, or $77.4 million cash, minus 25 per cent federal withholding.
