As the devastated family of a missing New Hampshire girl found dead struggles to come to grips with their loss, the girl's grandfather is speaking out.

Dead: Divers found Celina Cass's body on Monday 
morning near a hydroelectric dam

The body of Celina Cass, of New Hampshire, was found on Monday in the Connecticut River almost a week after she disappeared, but detectives don’t know how she died.

Celina’s grandfather, Wally Laro, told the Boston Herald: 'I just hope justice is brought and whoever’s responsible gets the max because that little girl didn't deserve that.'

He added: 'I don’t want no Casey Anthony.'

Mr Laro was referring to the murder case out of Orlando, Florida, where Casey Anthony was on trial for the killing of her young daughter Caylee.

Last month, Casey Anthony was acquitted of the murder, and released from jail.

On Monday, a pick-up truck thought to belong to the troubled stepfather of the 11-year-old girl was been hauled away by investigators.

Neighbours said the vehicle taken away is typically driven by her stepfather and while it was on a flatbed outside the house, technicians could be seen examining its undercarriage.

Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, was reportedly hospitalised hours before her body was recovered from the river and returned to the community on Tuesday.

Witnesses said Mr Noyes was taken away by ambulance on Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown.

Mr Noyes was reportedly involuntarily committed to a mental institution and diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003, and was said to be receiving treatment for his mental illness.

Officials are not expected to make any announcements on the progress of their investigation just yet - and the New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young would not comment on Wednesday.

Ms Young said on Tuesday that an autopsy failed to determine how the girl died - and further toxicology tests and more investigations were needed, but the death was considered suspicious.

Meanwhile, Jeanine Brady, a family 
friend and the employer of Celina's mother, said the girl's body had 
been turned over to the family and that a private service was being 
planned.

Divers found Celina's body on Monday 
near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River between 
Celina's hometown of Stewartstown and Canaan, Vermont.

It ended an intense search that at its peak involved more than 100 federal, state and local law enforcement officers.

Celina, who lived with her older 
sister, mother and stepfather a mile from Canada, was last seen at her 
home computer around 9pm on July 25 and was gone the next morning, 
authorities said.

Police said there was no sign of a struggle and there was no indication she ran away or someone took her.

The autopsy was unable to determine 
how she died – and community residents were saddened that the autopsy 
wasn't able to provide them with any closure.

'I don't even know what to say,’ said
Debbie Whelan whose daughter was Celina’s friend. ‘I thought the 
community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them 
tonight.’

The lack of answers was 'scary,' said
Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the 
house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and another
man.

'We still don't know what happened, 
and that's terrifying,' Ms Towle said. After a news conference, 
teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's 
memory.

'Someone has to light the way for 
Celina,' said Kayla Baglio, 18. 'It's to let her know no matter what, 
people are going to be here for her.'

Earlier Tuesday, investigators combed
the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, 
above where Celina's body was found.

A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

Because of the town's remote 
location, law enforcement officers went so far as to have a mobile phone
tower erected to assist in communications.

Five hundred tips were received and 
the FBI offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to her and to 
the arrest and prosecution of anyone responsible for her disappearance.
