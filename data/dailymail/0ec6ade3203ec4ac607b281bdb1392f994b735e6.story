Sam Allardyce has criticised the Football Association for punishing Nigel Pearson over his explosive altercation with a fan – and blamed the security at Leicester's King Power Stadium.

A video emerged of Pearson telling one of his own fans to 'fuck off and die' during their 3-1 defeat by Liverpool at the start of December.

The Leicester manager has since accepted an FA charge of using 'abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator,' but Allardyce, whose West Ham side host Pearson's team on Saturday, considers the punishment unfair.

The FA were wrong to punish Nigel Pearson over his row with a fan, according to Sam Allardyce

Allardyce claimed Pearson was let down by security inside the King Power Stadium

'I think that it depends on what position you’re in at that moment in particular time and if somebody has baited you as much as that fella did then if you get a reaction, you get a reaction,' Allardyce said. 'We’re all human beings aren’t we? When you lose your rag, what do you do? Do you stay calm? No.

'We cannot be angels all the time in this badly politically correct world we have. This politically correct world drives you up the wall. We’ll be shutting the door too hard soon.

'I think [the FA charge] is wrong, personally. He should get a warning about his future conduct, because he hasn't stepped out of line before. But the FA are just as scared as everyone else about being PC.'

Allardyce admitted he has had altercations with fans in the past that were not caught on camera, but declined to elaborate further on them. The 60-year-old worked with Pearson for seven months at Newcastle, keeping him on as a coach when he took over at the club in 2007.

West Ham manager Allardyce said that he too had had confrontations with supporters during his career

Pearson worked as a coach under Allardyce back in 2007 when the latter was Newcastle manager 

The Foxes have not won a Premier League match since their surprise 5-3 win against Manchester United

Allarcye added: 'It’s up the clubs and the security system at the football club. I think Leicester’s security let Nigel down because this lad was baiting him all the time so they should have gone over, nipped him by the collar and pushed him out and said don’t bother coming back here.

'It’s what Manchester United have been doing for years to stop anything like that happening. Fans are fans, up to a point. If a manager turned around pointed to a policeman and said, “Look, this guy’s doing this, I want you to arrest him”, that will cause mayhem.

'Club security should look at that situation around where they dugout is and if somebody’s being particularly, constantly verbally aggressive then the security should take the fan away and say it’s not an acceptable behaviour.'
