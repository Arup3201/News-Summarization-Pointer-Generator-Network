Backyard death: Student William McCaw was found dead in a New Jersey backyard by police

A man who was already facing trial for the death of a cyclist in a hit-and-run accident has now been arrested over the death of a college student, who was found in the backyard of a New Jersey home last month.

Middlesex County prosecutors say Timothy Puskas, 38, is being charged with murder for the death of William McCaw, a 22-year-old Rutgers University student who was found February 15 outside a New Brunswick home.

Puskas was already looking at jail time for allegedly killing a bicyclist in a 2012 hit-and-run.

Puskas was arrested on Friday in Milltown, New Jersey on charges of aggravated assault that were unrelated to McCaw's killing.

Prosecutors did not elaborate on what allegedly happened between Puskas and McCaw, but a spokesman said the preliminary investigation indicated they did not know each other.

Investigators believe McCaw died of blunt force trauma and killed between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m. the day after he attended a fraternity party.

'He was going from place to place, having a good time, enjoying his weekend, when he came upon the defendant,' says Assistant Prosecutor Sheree Pitch. 'When he came upon him, his weekend ended.'

McCaw had no connection to the people who lived in the home, and it is not clear where he was attacked.

McCaw, originally from Gallatin, Tenn., previously attended Rutgers University and would return to New Brunswick occasionally to visit friends.

His battered body was found outside a house on Hartwell Street.

Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz set Puskas' bail at $5 million, the prosecutors said.

'I hope that the family and friends of William McCaw have at least some sense of relief knowing that the murderer has been charged and is behind bars,' said Middlesex County Acting Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey.

'There have been many dedicated individuals who have worked tirelessly and diligently to solve this brutal crime,' Carey said in a statement.

'I hope that the family and friends of William McCaw have at least some sense of relief knowing that the murderer has been charged and is behind bars.'

Strangers: Police say McCaw did not know the residents at the home in New Jersey where he was found dead

'I'm just glad the guy got caught 
honestly,' says Rutgers junior Jeff Contino to News 12. 'I mean, it's 
nice realizing that it's a little bit safer.'

Rutgers junior Charles Owl agrees. 'It's just something that the community has been pretty distraught about,' he says.

According to his Facebook account, McCaw was a sales rep at GetyourGreek.com and interned at the Bank of New York Mellon.

Graham Lewis, a Rutgers student and a friend of McCaw, said he was 'the kindest and nicest person in the world.'

'He
 would never hurt a soul and was always smiling,' Lewis said in an 
email. 'He loved Rutgers more than he loved his own friends sometimes.'

Killed:McCaw was attending a party at the home, visiting former fraternity brothers when he was attacked last month

Hit-and-run: Leonel Hernandez Â¿ a 26-year-old married father of two young children, was out cycling when he was killed by Puskas who drove into him

In
 the other charge, the hit-and-run killing occurred on January 25 2012 
as Puskas and a pal were driving towards North Brunswick.

Puskas
 was behind the wheel of his black 1998 Toyota 4Runner when he crossed 
into oncoming traffic striking a bicyclist Leonel Hernandez, a 
26-year-old father-of-two.

Puskas fled the scene, but was arrested a few days later.

He was free on bail and due to go on trial for aggravated manslaughter in June. He is now being held in the Middlesex County Jail on $5 million bail.
