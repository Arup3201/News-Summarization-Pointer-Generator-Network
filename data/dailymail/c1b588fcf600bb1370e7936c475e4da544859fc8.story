Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud claims Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo has asked to join the French club on loan.

The 21-year old is behind a plethora of attacking options in the pecking order at Arsenal with Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott all vying for a starting spot.

Arsene Wenger is happy for the former Auxerre striker to head out on loan but would much prefer Sanogo, who has only featured six times for the Gunners this season and has struggled with injuries, to play for a Premier League outfit.

'Sanogo wants to come to Bordeaux on loan', Triaud told Gold FM.

'And he has informed Arsene Wenger [about his wish]. We've asked for Arsenal to give us a response on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.'

Bordeaux manager Willy Sagnol, the former France and Bayern Munich right back, wants to bring Sanogo to the Stade Chaban-Delmas with his side sixth in Ligue 1 and ten points off Marseille at the top.

Wenger could be more inclined to let Sanogo head to France with plenty attacking cover at his disposal with Joel Campbell and 19-year-old Chuba Akpom recently coming off the bench.
