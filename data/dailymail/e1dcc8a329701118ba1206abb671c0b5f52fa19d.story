Meetings: The summits have often been with politicians representing Prince Charles's pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change and town planning

The full extent of Prince Charles’s influence over public life emerged last night.

Since the election he has held 36 private meetings with Cabinet ministers – one a month.

The summits have often been with politicians representing his pet issues, such as rural affairs, climate change, health and town planning.

But critics accused him of an ‘incontinence of lobbying’. Including junior ministers, Charles has enjoyed a total of 53 private audiences since May 2010.

He has met David Cameron seven times and Labour leader Ed Miliband three times. But he has only met Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, once.

Last night a Clarence House spokesman insisted the Prince of Wales ‘has a right’ to ‘communicate privately’ with the government.

Ministers have long complained about being bombarded with so-called ‘black-spider’ handwritten memos from Charles, in which he has expounded his view on a variety of issues.

In 2005, a memo was disclosed at an employment tribunal in which Charles blamed the education system for making people ‘think they can all be pop stars’.

The Prince is known for his strident views on a range of public policy areas. He has spoken out on green issues and rural affairs, and is vocal in his support for alternative medicines such as homeopathy.

He also speaks out on town planning – he has sponsored a new model development in Poundbury, Dorset – and against modern architecture.

In line with his interest in green issues, he has met ministers from the Department for Energy and Climate Change seven times, including secretaries of state Chris Huhne and Ed Davey. 

He met junior minister Greg Barker no 
fewer than four times. Ministers from the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs have been called in five times.

Discussions: Charles has met David Cameron (left) seven times and recently spoke to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) about the regulation of herbal medicines

Talks: Charles has met almost all the Cabinet, including Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) twice and Home Secretary Theresa May (right) once

On health, Charles recently met Jeremy Hunt to discuss the regulation of herbal medicines and funding for alternative medicines.

He has also met four ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government, which has responsibility for town planning and architecture.

While he has met almost all the Cabinet, he has shown much less of an interest in those heading up other important departments. He has met Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne just once each, and has never met a justice minister.

Details of the full extent of his meetings comes after controversy over the High Court’s continuing refusal to allow the publication of letters that he has written to a range of government departments.

Last night Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘It is not the Prince of Wales’s duty to have private meetings with ministers and be involved in the political decisions of this country. The main qualification of the job of head of state – which he will eventually be – is to be above the maelstrom of politics.

Paul Flynn, Labour MP

‘This is an incontinence of lobbying from Prince Charles. There is a move towards transparency in lobbying in general, but this should include royal lobbying from one of the most powerful and influential men in the country.

‘Imagine what will happen when he is monarch. If there is a bill he disagrees with, will he lobby against it? If he carries on like this when he is king, it will provoke a constitutional crisis.’

Mr Flynn called for minutes of the meetings to be publicly available. ‘There is absolutely no reason for all this secrecy,’ he said.

Financial matters: Charles has met both Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (right) just once

Summits: He has met Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) once in 2011, and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) twice, in 2010 and last October

The issue of Charles’s opinions is becoming more and more relevant because he has recently started to take on more official duties from his 87-year-old mother. He will, for example, take the place of the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka in November.

'The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses'

Clarence House spokesman

It is understood the majority of the meetings were requested by the Prince rather than the ministers concerned. Minutes are not publicly available, with both sides refusing to disclose what is discussed. The bare facts of the meetings are published on the Court Circular.

A spokesman for Clarence House said: ‘Official meetings, sometimes instigated by ministers, are important to the Prince in his role as heir to the throne and ministers from successive governments have found that he brings important insights, perspectives and knowledge built over 40 years of experience in a range of areas aimed at transforming lives and building sustainable communities.’

She added: ‘The Prince of Wales has a right, indeed it is his duty, to communicate privately with the government on any matter he chooses, to bring his unique perspective and reflect the many issues people raise with him personally on his extensive engagements around the country.’
