Buddy Franklin was the name on tens of thousands of fans' lips as the AFL grand final parade proceeded on a sunny spring day in Melbourne.

Franklin and Dan Hannebery's vehicle was the one that generated the most noise from the streets as the motorcade worked its way through the CBD.

Whether kitted out in red and white or brown and gold, supporters let their feelings known about the man who left Hawthorn after winning the 2013 flag to join Sydney on a nine-year, $10 million deal.

Sydney Swans forward Buddy Franklin generated the biggest reaction from the crowd at today's Grand Final parade in Melbourne

Some booed, despite Hawthorn on-baller Jordan Lewis' pleas on Thursday not to poke the Buddy bear, while others chanted Buddy's name.

Journalists, TV cameramen and paparazzi jostled as Franklin's car rolled down Swanston Street.

None of them were able to find front position in the way Franklin has on the field so often in this year's finals series.

Franklin was as relaxed as ever, waving to fans and answering all questions with a grin.

Cyril Rioli and Ben McEvoy were arguably the happiest men in the procession, having been recalled by Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson on Thursday night.

Josh Gibson, as has happened often this year, found himself a supporting actor in the Buddy circus.

Gibson remains a close friend of Franklin and is the Hawthorn defender most likely to be handed the unenviable task of manning the star at the MCG on Saturday.

Hawthorn fans gave vocal well wishes to Gibson, some going a step further.

'Gibbo, give it to Buddy tomorrow! Kill him,' one yelled out as Gibson waved to the adoring faithful.

It wasn't a literal proposition, thankfully.

There were reports of a heightened police and private security presence

The annual event was without incident, with an increased police and private security force watching on as diverted trams and cars created gridlock around the mass of pedestrians.

As always, the parade finished with both sides being presented to the public on the steps of the Treasury Building.

While it looks set to be a close match, there's one footy-fan who thinks they know who will take the title.

Australia Zoo keeper Becky-Jo Quinn, a Hawthorn fan, said she thought that Predictaroo's prophecy was on point.

'I think our she knows her stuff, as Hawthorn is going for their second win in a row,' she said.

'We'll have to wait and see what the weekend holds, but I hope she is right!'
