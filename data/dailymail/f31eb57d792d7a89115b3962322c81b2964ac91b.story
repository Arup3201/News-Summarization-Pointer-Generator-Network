Harley Russo is clearly a boy who is committed to a cause and nothing will stop from achieving his golden dream.

Instead of spending Christmas night with his loved ones - the 15-year-old chose to sleep on concrete outside the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra to ensure he would be the first person anywhere in the world to receive the first freshly minted coin for 2015.

A boy on a serious seven day mission - this is now the third time Harley has accomplished this unusual feat for someone of such a young age.

Although this was the longest stint that Harley had slept rough outside the mint - it is not stopping him from striving for the quadrella next year - which is made possible due to Australia's time zone.

'It's the longest I've ever stayed so it was a bit more of a challenge,' he told the ABC.

'But there was some talk on Facebook that people were planning to get here on Boxing Day, so I decided I'd get here on Christmas.'

His fascination with coins started when his mother showed him some of her own collection from when she was a child. 

'Then we came to the mint and I saw some silver sets with holographic designs and I fell in love with it,' he told the ABC.

'I just see that at the end of it there's going to be a chance to build for my future.

'I won't be letting go of the coin anytime soon.'
