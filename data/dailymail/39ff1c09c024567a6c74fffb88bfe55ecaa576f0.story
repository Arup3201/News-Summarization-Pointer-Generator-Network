The owner of a racy coffee stand where baristas serve customers while wearing bikinis has angered local residents after she posted cruel comments on the business’ Facebook page about a customer’s size.

The war of words between Meghan Calavan, who owns the self-styled ‘sexy sailor coffee shop’ Sips Ahoy, and Jesseka Cladek from Anacortes, Washington, has escalated out of control since just before Christmas.

According to Meghan, the trouble started after someone – believed to be a friend or relative of Jesseka - posted a nasty comment on the stand's Facebook page.

Jesseka says that Meghan responded by posting a series of vulgar and hateful comments referencing the women's weight and appearance.

Meghan also reportedly criticized Jesseka's appearance, calling her ‘fat,’ advising her to ‘save world hunger by shooting yourself’ and telling another commenter that ‘the world would be a better place if [Cladek] died.’

‘What if I was unstable and actually did kill myself?’ Jesseka asked King5. ‘Words have an impact on people.’

The Sips Ahoy Facebook page has since been taken down, but another Facebook page, Boycott Sips Ahoy, has launched and quickly amassed 4,700 followers.

Its stated aim is to put the coffee kiosk out of business and it has posted screen grabs of the original comments made by Meghan.

‘I've never had to be scared for my life or ever thought someone wish I were dead,’ wrote Jesseka on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page.

Many posts call for the coffee shop's imminent closure, accusing it of cyberbullying.

‘I made this page to close Sips Ahoy down. We don't want this place of business in our small town,’ the administrator states in the About section of the new Facebook page.

As news of the incident has spread in the small town of 16,000 people, Meghan and her family have become the target of threats and even violence.

Meghan has admitted that she and her staff are now scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute

She lives with her father, Kelly, and their home was recently egged and his vehicle dented.

One poster on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page even suggested that someone should put urine or gasoline in a super soaker and burn the coffee stand down.

Meghan told King5 that she and her staff are scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute.

'I stuck up for myself in an immature manner, I know,' she told King5.

Police say the dent in the Calavans' car means the incident could become a felony investigation. They have advised everyone involved to stop and take a deep breath before someone gets hurt.

Meghan has said she is sorry for her part and claims she's learned an important lesson, while Jesseka has asked for everyone to stop the negative comments and actions.
