iPhone owners are already getting phone calls, directions and music on their iPhones, but how about changing the channel on the TV?

One company has made it possible, allowing anyone to turn their iPhone or other Apple product into a universal remote.

The ST-URB1 plugs into the headphone jack of recent Apple devices - including the iPhone, iPad and iPad mini - and works with Satechi’s RemoteBean app.

Useful: Satechi's universal remore allows anyone to turn their iPhone or other Apple product into a universal remote

The app guides a user around their home, producing easy instructions on how to synch the mechanism with a TV, stereo or cable box.

RemoteBean is available in the iTunes store, but won’t work without the plug-in.

The universal remote device is on sale on Satechi’s website for $25.

Satechi already boasts products that can change any iOS device into laser pointers, as well as accessories like charges, holders and speakers.

It's just the latest example of a company forming a partnership with Apple to deliver more high-tech products with the help of the tech giant's products.

Portable: The ST-URB1 is available for $25, and can be carried around on a keyring

Earlier this week, it was reported that 
GM's 2013 Chevrolet Spark and Sonic LZ and RS will feature Siri, the 
hands-free, voice-operated version of the iPhone personal assistant, 
allowing drivers to safely keep their eyes on the road while using their
iPhones to make calls, play music or text.

The auto giant announced the partnership on Tuesday at the Los Angeles International Auto Show.

Through the cars’ standard Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system, customers with a compatible iPhone running iOS 6 can direct Siri to perform a number of tasks.

To further minimize driver distraction, Siri uses a hands-free function called 'Eyes Free' mode that allows users to interact with their iPhone using nothing more than their voice.

Owners simply connect their iPhone with the MyLink radio via Bluetooth, pair with the system, and use the steering wheel voice activation button to begin and end sessions with Siri in 'Eyes Free' mode.
