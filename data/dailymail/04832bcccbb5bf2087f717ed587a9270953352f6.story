An Iraqi MP and United Nations relief workers today dismissed claims by the U.S. and the UK that the humanitarian crisis on Mount Sinjar was all but over.

Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil claims some 70-80,000 refugees are still stranded on the mountain despite assertions from American and British leaders that they number only in their low thousands.

President Barack Obama yesterday said the ten-day siege by the Islamic State had been 'broken' by missile strikes and humanitarian aid drops, allowing tens of thousands of Yazidis to escape.

Downing Street also said the situation had improved so much that further aid drops may not be necessary.

But Ms Dakhil said this was not the picture she was getting from other Yazidi leaders she had spoken to in the area.

She is currently being treated at a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, after she was injured when a helicopter crashed while trying to airlift her off the mountain.

Speaking from her hospital bed, she told the New York Times: 'It’s better now than it had been, but it’s just not true that all of them are safe — they are not.

'Especially on the south side of the mountain, the situation is very terrible.'

She suggested that American reconnaissance missions had only visited the north side the mountain.

During a parliament session this month, Dakhil broke into tears while describing the plight of her fellow Yazidis during the onslaught by IS in northern Iraq.

Her claims were backed up by the UN which said the crisis was 'by no means over'.

David Swanson, a spokesman for the United Nations co-ordinator of humanitarian affairs in Iraq, said: 'Although many people managed to escape from the north side, there are still thousands of others up there, under conditions of extreme heat, dehydration and imminent threat of attack.

'The situation is far from solved.'

Kieran Dwyer, the chief spokesman for the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator added that the 'problem remains grave'.

Their comments came after dramatic images emerged of the moment a humanitarian air drop was made by Hercules transporters over Mount Sinjar.

The image - taken from a Litening III reconnaissance pod fitted to a Tornado GR4 aircraft on Wednesday night – was released as U.S. President Barack Obama declared the Islamic State siege of the area had been 'broken' by British and American intervention.

Last night, a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘The number of people still on the 
mountainside was now in the low thousands, with Kurdish forces assisting
 around a thousand people to get off the mountain to safety every night.

‘This
 view has been reinforced by images captured by UK Tornados who flew a 
surveillance mission over the mountain last night and could not identify
 people in the numbers previously estimated.

‘Alongside
 this surveillance mission, two C130s distributed another 22 tonnes of 
aid last night to those on Mount Sinjar, including a further 13,200 
litres of clean water and 480 shelter kits.

‘We are currently reviewing the need for additional airdrops, given that there appear to be adequate supplies on the mountain.’

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will today press European allies to step up efforts to support Iraq as Downing Street indicated that Britain could supply arms to Kurdish fighters to help them take on IS jihadists.

The Foreign Secretary will tell his European Union counterparts that there is a need for better co-ordination on both the aid effort and getting military supplies to the Kurds, who have complained about being outgunned by the militants.

It is understood the UK would provide weapons and equipment should the Kurdish leadership make a request.

In Iraq, there was a breakthrough in the political deadlock as prime minister Nouri Maliki agreed to step down following the nomination of Haider Abadi.

The UK has called for Mr Abadi to form an inclusive government in Iraq, following concerns that Mr Maliki's administration had marginalised Sunni Muslims and helped fuel the IS insurgency.

The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been at the forefront of efforts to halt the IS advance, and their efforts have been praised for helping thousands of Yazidis flee from Mount Sinjar where they had been trapped by the jihadists.

At a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and senior officials agreed it was 'vital' that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are able to tackle IS.

On what equipment would be provided to the Kurds, a No 10 source said: 'It is dependent on what the Kurds would need.'

France has already committed to supplying materiel, with president Francois Hollande confirming the 'imminent delivery of military equipment' to Kurdish forces in a phone call with Iraqi president Fouad Massoum.

But the UK has so far only agreed to transport military equipment supplied by other countries to the Kurds.

At an emergency meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Mr Hammond will press for 'better co-ordination of aid and military supplies to Iraq', according to No 10.

Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande have also signalled that today's meeting could result in the European Union doing more to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq, as the focus remains on the plight of thousands of refugees who have fled IS militants.

The need for further UK aid drops to refugees trapped on an Sinjar's mountainside is under review as it appears there are 'adequate supplies', Downing Street said, as it noted the option would be retained in case further need emerged.

A rescue mission in Iraq involving the UK military is less likely after a US special forces operation discovered that thousands of Yazidis had escaped.

President Barack Obama claimed the US had broken the Islamic militants' siege on Sinjar but added air strikes would continue.

Britain will continue to monitor the situation on the mountain with the US and Kurdish forces, No 10 said, with Chinook helicopters and Tornados remaining in the region.
