Hundreds of people said a final goodbye today to a murdered clergyman in the church where he was installed as priest just a few months ago.

Nearly 500 people filled St Mary's Church in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, to pay their respects to the 59-year-old Reverend John Suddards.

Among the mourners were Mr Suddards's sister Hilary Bosworth, her husband Phil, and their children Hannah, Vicky and Simon.

Other people who joined the service, which was led by The Bishop of Gloucester, the Right Rev Michael Perham, included the Bishop of Colchester and clergy and friends from Mr Suddards's former parish in Witham, Essex.

Workmen found Mr Suddards stabbed to death in the hallway of the vicarage on Valentine's Day.

The news of his death sent shockwaves through the clergy and the close-knit community in Thornbury, about 11 miles north of Bristol, where he was only installed as parish priest last July.

During today's service, Mr Bosworth read a tribute to his brother-in-law that was written by his wife.

'As John's family we have great memories of John,' he told mourners.

'Just
last Christmas Day he was very happy to sit with a large glass of red 
wine having enjoyed a good dinner and chuckling at Absolutely Fabulous 
on TV.

'His visits to us in Dorset were always a 'getaway from it all' time and he enjoyed walking the dog on the beach or taking Hilary and the children on tours of the countryside with a pub lunch on the way.

'Frequently these trips would happen to deviate by an interesting old church or priory and much to the children's pleasure often ended with an ice cream and some sweets.'

Mr Bosworth added: 'Uncle John was great fun and much loved by Hannah, Vicky and Simon.

'He was fascinated to watch our children growing into adulthood and always wanted to know their plans and career moves.

'He was especially looking forward to marrying Hannah and John at their wedding in Dorset in September.

'It seemed right that his funeral should be here at St Mary's at this beautiful church, of which John was so proud, and for which he had such great plans.

'He would be so touched to see so many people here today; family, old and new friends, godchildren, parishioners, colleagues and fellow clergy.

'His loss is keenly felt and he is much missed.'

Mourners sang the hymns I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say, Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ended and Thine Be The Glory, Risen, Conquering Son, and received Holy Communion.

A private cremation is to take place in Dorset, where Mr Suddards's family live.

Speaking after the service, the Bishop of Gloucester described the atmosphere inside the church.

The former barrister moved to the area after serving at St Nicolas Church in Witham, since 2001 and before that at Great Yeldham parish, 20 miles away

'Principally, joyful,' Bishop Michael said.

'There is still a lot of sadness in people's hearts but we've moved on from that initial moment of grief and confusion to be able to focus today on John and his life.

'His life was a wonderful life of Christian service and joyful faith and fun and good pastoral ministry.

'Of course there was some sadness and tears because we are all human beings but the joy and the sadness can all be mixed in together.

'But I think the sense of celebration was dominant.'

The Bishop also praised Mr Suddards for his 'incisive mind'.

He said: 'He was gentle with a really incisive mind.

'I never had an argument with him but I think if I had I think I'd have probably lost.

'When I asked him at interview for this post: 'What's the heart of your Gospel and faith? and he said: 'The love of God'.

'And I think the love of God was something that showed in his life a lot; in the way that he cared for people and taught people.

'He was just a first rate parish priest and the sort every parish would want to have.'

Stephen Farrow, 47, has been charged with the murder of Mr Suddards and also that of retired teacher Betty Yates, 77, in Bewdley, Worcestershire.

Farrow was arrested on February 19 in Folkestone, Kent, following a tip-off from the public after police launched a nationwide manhunt.

Mrs Yates was found dead at the bottom of the stairs at her home on the banks of the River Severn on January 4, having been killed two days earlier.
