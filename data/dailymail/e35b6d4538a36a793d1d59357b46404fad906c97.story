MailOnline Sport launches a mini-series of Football Friday Google+ Hangouts this week. Neil Ashton, the most prolific football journalist in the UK, will lead the debate as the Barclays Premier League reaches its thrilling climax.

Manchester United may have won the title, but they're still racing towards a record points hauls. Will they do it? Chelsea stand in their way this weekend...

Talking of Chelsea, who will be in the manager's seat next season? It won't be Rafa Benitez.

Will it be the Special One? Sportsmail's Ashton is the man in the know. This is your chance to ask him.

Biter Luis Suarez was booed at the glitzy - but controversial - PFA Awards night.

Was that unjust? Neil was in the audience. Liverpool fans, join the debate and ask our Football News Correspondent his views.

The Merseyside derby at Anfield is 
another of this Sunday's stand-out matches, being played against the 
back-drop of a fierce race for European qualification.

There's still much at stake for both 
Liverpool and Everton and Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea. Find out how 
Neil sees that battle playing out.

Can Tottenham hang on to Gareth Bale? How long will Arsene Wenger remain at the helm at Arsenal? Is Fernando Torres as bad as the media make him out to be? The questions are there to be asked. Find out if Neil has the answers on Friday...

Talking point: This is the moment immediately after Liverpool's striker Luis Suarez (right) bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic
