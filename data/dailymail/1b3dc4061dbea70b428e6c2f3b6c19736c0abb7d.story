The boy whose incredible choreographed bar mitzvah dance became an internet sensation has now taken over New York, giving a second dazzling performance on Broadway this morning.

Thirteen-year-old Sam Horowitz grinned as he performed with backing dancers on Good Morning America - while his mother revealed he planned his glitzy stage entrance when he was just nine.

'At a very young age, I took him to his first concert,' Angela Horowitz explained. 'Dancers came from the ceiling on chandeliers and he said, "Mom, I'm gonna do that for my bar mitzvah".

'I thought he would change in four years, but when Sam commits, he commits.'

On Broadway: Sam Horowitz, whose bar mitzvah dance became an internet hit, danced on GMA on Thursday

Passionate: The teenager, from Dallas, Texas, said his new found fame felt 'like a dream'

The teenager, from Dallas, Texas, took the internet by storm when the video, which was filmed last November, appeared on a Jewish parenting site. It now ranks as the most popular video on YouTube.

The video shows backup dancers, a stage with his name in giant letters and an enormous round box that drops from the ceiling to 
give the impression that Horowitz was lowered onto the stage.

'I would rehearse every Sunday for a month for three hours with my very good choreographer,' he told GMA, adding that his new-found fame is 'like a dream'.

'I never thought this would happen in my entire life,' he said.

The performance took place at the Omni Hotel in Dallas, and footage of the routine was posted on Youtube on November 26, 2012.

Supportive: Angela Horowitz said her son had been inspired by a music concert four years ago

Excited: Sam said he had practiced for three hours every Sunday for a month before his bar mitzvah performance

It was then posted to the Jewish parenting website Raising Kvell and has since gone viral.

Reactions
to the performance on the Internet were mixed - some people called the 
routine fabulous, others found it 'vulgar' and some people even went so 
far as to attack the boy's sexuality. 

'What is this? "Keeping up with the Steins"? Sorry, I find it vulgar, 
ostentatious, and humiliating,' commented Gary Goldstein, a physician from Oro Valley.

'Was this for the benefit of the parents 
or the kid? All that was missing was a stripper pole.'

Another person commented that, 'Sam is going to make some man very happy one day,' while another added that 'this little boy has to be gay because there would be no other reason to 
have something over the top for him. He's turning 13 years old he's not a
burlesque dancer.'

This isn't Horowitz's first performance, though - prior to his bar mitzvah dance routine, Horowitz filmed his own music video for the Carly Rae Jepsen hit 'Call Me Maybe.'

The footage shows him lounging around an opulent home and dancing in swimming pools  with friends as they mouth the words to the popular song.
