Ice use has doubled in Australia within the last three years, overtaking ecstasy and heroin as the hard drug of choice within the community.

Use of the deadly and addictive ice, otherwise known as crystal methamphetamine, doubled between 2010 and 2013, while ecstasy and heroin have shown a slight decline, figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare drug and alcohol survey show.

While the use of methamphetamine remained at a similar level to 2010, there was a major shift from using it in the powdered form to the crystal variety known as ice, AIHW spokesperson Geoff Neideck said.

The misuse of pharmaceuticals has also risen, increasing from 4.2 per cent in 2010 to 4.7 per cent in 2013.

On a brighter note, the study found Australians have cut back on cigarettes and alcohol between 2010 and 2013.

More teenagers aged from 12 to 17 are now abstaining from alcohol, while the age that kids have their first drink increasing from an average of 14 to almost 16 in the last 15 years.

The number of Australians who have reported being the victim of an alcohol-related incident in 2013 has fallen to 26 per cent from 29 per cent in 2010.

The Australian Drug Foundation John Rogerson chief executive said although prevention strategies were working, authorities should not be complacent.

‘We know that the younger a person drinks alcohol the more likely they are to binge drink and have a problem with alcohol later in life,’ he said. ‘But Australia is still very much in the grip of a dangerous love affair with booze.’

In other good news for the health of Australians, smokers are also cutting down on the number of cigarettes their are having each week.  In 2010, they smoked 111 cigarettes a week, while in 2013 that had fallen to 96.

The smoking rate for the Australian population has fallen from 15.1 per cent in 2010 to 12.8 per cent in 2013. rate was 15.1 per cent down to 12.8 per cent in 2013.

Quit Victoria policy manager Kylie Lindorff said the smoking data highlighted what could be achieved with a comprehensive approach to tobacco control.

‘This news is cause for celebration but we can't take our eyes off the ball - we still have a way to go to achieve the federal government target of 10 per cent of adults smoking prevalence by 2018,’ she said.

‘With tax increases already locked in for the next three years, there is no reason we can't see smoking rates drop even further if there is a renewed investment to funding anti-smoking campaigns at the necessary levels and a continued expansion of smokefree areas.’

The National Drug Strategy Household Survey is conducted every two to three years.

The 2013 survey collected data from nearly 24,000 people across Australia.
