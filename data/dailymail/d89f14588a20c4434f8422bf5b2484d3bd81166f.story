A convicted child rapist sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl after spiking her Fruit Shoot drink with vodka while on bail for another sex attack on a youngster.

Twisted Samuel Omar, 64, was given the opportunity to offend again after his court case for a vile attack on a young girl was delayed because of government funding cutbacks. 

The paedophile had been due to stand trial in May for sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl last July and superimposing her face onto pictures of topless models. 

But his case was adjourned until June 12 this year after Ministry of Justice spending cuts reduced the number of trials sitting at Northampton Crown 
Court.

Despite Omar, from Semilong, Northamptonshire, previously serving a 12-year prison sentence for raping a six-year-old girl in 1987, he was allowed out on bail after being charged with the sexual assault.

The delay in his trial gave Omar the chance to strike again and four days before he was due back in court he spiked a 12-year-old girl's Fruit Shoot drink with vodka before sexually abusing her.

Last Friday, he was finally jailed after he admitted the two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children.

He was sentenced indefinitely to imprisonment for public protection and must serve a minimum of three years and three months before being considered for parole.

Judge Sylvia De Bertodano told him: 'That does not mean you will be released then.

'You will only be released once a determination has been made you are no longer dangerous and that may be a very long time indeed.'

July 2011: Family of 10-year-old girl make complaint to police about Samuel Omar

August 8: Charged with sexual assault

August 24: First appears before Northampton magistrates and granted conditional bail

October 5: Appears again before Northampton magistrates and granted conditional bail as case is sent to crown court

October 31: Appears at Northampton Crown Court and pleads not guilty of sex assault

June 9, 2012: He is arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl

June 11: Breach of bail hearing at Hatfield Magistrates and remanded in custody

June 12: Appears at Northampton Crown Court, above, and pleads guilty to two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children

July 20: Jailed indefinitely for public protection

Children's charities blasted the decision to release Omar on bail in the first place.

The Ministry of Justice also waded into the debate today by telling MailOnline that dangerous offenders 'should always be remanded into custody' while awaiting trial.

Peter Bradley, Deputy Director of Kidscape, said: 'This is a horrific and worrying case of sexual abuse.

'Not only is Omar a dangerous paedophile whose rehabilitation was not effective, but also the system that is designed to protect children has clearly failed.

'The apparent failure of effective management of this case is partially to blame for the harm the girls and their families have suffered.

'There are many questions which need to be answered if the public are to have faith in the safeguarding system.

'I am particularly concerned that cutbacks in the number of trials at Crown Courts is allowing dangerous offenders to have extended access to the public and risk further assaults.'

Jon Brown, Head of the NSPCC's Sexual Abuse programme said: 'As this man was a convicted child rapist serious consideration should have been given to keeping him in custody.

'He had already proved a risk to children and this should have been taken into account when he appeared in court to face this new charge.

'There are always various matters to be considered when someone is given bail but protection of children should always be the priority.'

The court heard Omar was arrested in July last year when a 10-year-old told police he regularly touched and kissed her when alone.

Shockingly, despite his earlier conviction for child rape, he was granted bail by magistrates in Northampton and ordered to stand trial in May.

But when his trial was adjourned as a result of a cluttered court timetable, he targeted a 12-year-old in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

James McLernon, prosecuting, told the court: 'While on bail for the Northampton offence and a week before his re-listed trial, the defendant sexually assaulted another victim.

'On Saturday, June 9, an ambulance was called to her address where she was extremely intoxicated.

'Paramedics arrived and the defendant tried to drive away, but the ambulance blocked him in.

'She was incoherent and extremely distressed. Paramedics arrived and the defendant tried to drive away, but the ambulance blocked him in. She was incoherent and extremely distressed.'

Officers discovered the girl's Fruit Shoot drink had been topped up with vodka.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'Dangerous offenders who pose a threat to society should always be remanded into custody while they await trial.

'The decision to grant bail is taken by the police and courts based on the full facts of each case.

'The overwhelming majority of people bailed do not reoffend and are often given strict conditions such as electronic tags and curfews.

'Anyone who reoffends while on bail will usually receive a longer sentence as a result.'
