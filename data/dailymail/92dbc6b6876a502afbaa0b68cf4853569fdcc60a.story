Three senior BBC journalists have been accused of having a conflict of interest in accepting thousands of pounds to speak at conferences held by some of the organisations they are supposed to scrutinise.

The Mail on Sunday has found that Radio 4 Today presenter Sarah Montague, economics editor Stephanie Flanders and Radio 5 Live chief political correspondent John Pienaar have agreed four and five-figure fees to officiate at events held by the NHS, the European Commission and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents accountants in Whitehall and local government.

Critics say this moonlighting could affect the trio’s ability to report impartially because they are receiving money from some of the institutions they cover.

Last night, Tory MP Alun Cairns called for a register where BBC journalists would declare all outside earnings.

He said: ‘Well-known journalists are often asked to attend these conferences for money. That potentially establishes an unhealthy relationship.’

BBC rules state that anyone signing up to a speaking agency must have written permission from their head of department and that each engagement is examined case by case.

But, with dozens of BBC employees being 
offered lucrative opportunities each month, insiders admit the system is
 difficult to police.

Ms Montague is understood to have been paid five figures this month for chairing events at an NHS conference, while Ms Flanders, who according to agency JLA charges up to £25,000 per event, pulled out of a European Commission debate on June 19 after MoS enquiries.

But both she and John Pienaar, a regular on the after-dinner circuit, are scheduled to appear at the CIPFA annual conference in July.

A BBC spokesman denied any infringement of impartiality rules had taken place.
