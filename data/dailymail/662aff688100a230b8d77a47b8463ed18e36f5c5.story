U.S. Attorney General: President Barack Obama on Saturday picked Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, 55, to bethe next U.S. attorney general

President Barack Obama on
Saturday picked Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be
the next U.S. attorney general, praising her as someone who
would bring a commitment to criminal justice reform and other
key administration priorities.

If confirmed, Lynch, 55, would be the first black woman to
serve in the post, bringing with her a family history that
stretches back generations to great-great grandparents who were
slaves.

Obama said he hoped the Senate would confirm Lynch, who he
said had distinguished herself as tough and fair in her two
stints as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York,
which covers Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens and Staten Island,
without delay.

Lynch would replace Eric Holder, the first black attorney
general, who has held the job since Obama took office in 2009.
She was among several candidates Holder had recommended to
succeed him.

'Loretta might be the only lawyer in America who battles
mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the
reputation for being a charming people person,' Obama said in
announcing the nomination.

Obama described Lynch as a tough, fair, and independent lawyer who shares his 'fierce commitment to equal justice under the law.'

'It's pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta,' Obama said.

Plans: The White House had planned to announce the selection later this month after Obama returned from his trip to Asia but the timing was moved up after her selection leaked out to the media

The announcement, made in the White House's Roosevelt room,
was unusual both for its timing and for Obama's selection of
someone for a top job with whom he has little personal history.

After the announcement, Lynch took to the podium and expressed her gratitude toward Obama and his faith in her.

'If I have the honor of being confirmed by the senate,' Lynch said, 'I will wake up every morning with the protection of the american people my first thought and I will work every day to safeguard our citizens, our liberties, our rights, and this great nation which has given so much to me and my family.' 

It is hard to say whether the nomination will be welcomed by Republicans on Capitol Hill who often disagreed with Holder during his time as attorney general, according to Fox News.

Big: Lynch's nomination is the first big personnel change Obamahas announced since Republicans won control of the Senate incongressional elections on Tuesday

The White House had planned to announce the selection later
this month after Obama returned from his trip to Asia but the
timing was moved up after her selection leaked out to the media.

The president leaves on Sunday for a trip to China, Myanmar,
and Australia.

Holder announced earlier this year that he was stepping
down. Lynch's nomination is the first big personnel change Obama
has announced since Republicans won control of the Senate in
congressional elections on Tuesday.
