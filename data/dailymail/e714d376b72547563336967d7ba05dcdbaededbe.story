Physicist Stephen Hawking arrived united his first wife as they attended the London premiere of his biopic The Theory Of Everything to see themselves portrayed on screen by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. 

Hawking and Jane Wilde, who divorced in 1995 after 30 years of marriage, have become closer since his 2006 split from his second wife and appeared on friendly terms as they arrived to see the Oscars-tipped film at the Odeon in Leicester Square.

They also mingled with Redmayne and Jones, who have been  widely praised for their portrayals of the renowned physicist and his first wife in the tale of their early relationship, Hawking's first steps in his career and his diagnosis with motor neurone disease.

Poignant: Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were joined by their real-life counterparts Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde at the premiere of his biopic The Theory of Everything in London on Tuesday night

Uncanny: Redmayne and Jones (left) portray the former couple (pictured on their wedding day, right) from  the renowned scientist’s days as a PhD student through to him being honoured by the Queen in 1989

Praise: Hawking has already lauded the 32-year-old's portrayal of him on the big screen, admitting he kept mistaking Redmayne for himself

The film, which has already been tipped for awards season success, is based on Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen.

Largely centred on the former couple's relationship, it covers the period from Hawking's days as a PhD student at Cambridge until 1989 when he was named a Companion of Honour by the Queen.

In an especially poignant moment for Redmayne, he was joined by  Hawking in front of photographers as the pair prepared to watch the early years of his life played out on film.

Speaking on the blue carpet, the 32-year-old actor admitted that despite having crossed paths with the professor during his own student days at Cambridge, he still felt starstruck at the prospect of playing him.

He said: 'I'd been a student at Cambridge and seen Stephen across campus, heard his voice, but I was pretty ignorant so when I read the script, everything was a revelation.

'Stephen and Jane let Felicity and I into their lives, so we felt an enormous amount of responsibility to get it right.'

When asked about the possibility that the role will land him a nod at next year's Oscars, the modest star added: 'I try not to listen to buzz because it's a fleeting thing and if you listen to the good stuff you automatically take on the bad stuff, so I try to put my fingers in my ears and just keep putting one foot in front of the other.'

Looks like they're old friends: Eddie Redmayne looked thrilled to see Professor Hawking's first wife Jane Wilde

Working closely: Redmayne and Jones were introduced to Hawking and his ex-wife several times before filming took place

Man of the hour: The actor beamed as he stood next to the renowned scientist on the custom-made blue carpet at the London screening

Buzz: Redmayne led the cast at the premiere of the highly-anticipated new movie, which has already been tipped for awards season success

Loving: They may have split in 1995 after 30 years together but Hawking and Wilde have become close  since his divorce from his second wife

Esteemed opinion: Jones has revealed that she was nervous ahead of learning what the genius thought of the film

Inspiration: The Theory Of Everything is adapted from Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, about their 30-year marriage. They have grown closer since his divorce from second wife Elaine Mason in 2006

Wilde, who was married to the genius from 1965 until 1995, also got to come face-to-face with actress Jones, who plays her on the big screen.

Jones, who looked stunning in a  white Dior lampshade-style gown, spoke highly of the woman she plays on the big screen, now a professor of Romance languages, who once famously described physics as her then-husband's 'mistress, his one true love'.

She gushed: 'Jane is incredibly open, she showed me photos of her and Stephen when they first met and I really felt I was getting this glimpse into an intimate side of their lives.

'Stephen and Jane have this wonderful unsentimental approach to life and such wit, so wherever we could we wanted to put that into the film.' 

Hawking first met Wilde, who was a friend of one of his sisters, when he was a graduate student at Cambridge and shortly before he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.

Portrayal: Jones plays Wilde when she first met Hawking at Cambridge university through to 1989 in the widely-praised project

Warm greetings: Jones appeared delighted to catch up with Wilde and has previously insisted it is 'her film'

Troubled: Wilde, now a professor of Romance languages, has famously described physics as her then-husband's 'mistress'. The pair wed in 1965 and divorced 30 years later

The perfect couple: Redmayne and Jones made an attractive pair as they walked the blue carpet in Leicester Square together

Androgynous: Maxine Peake, who plays Hawking's second wife Elaine Mason in the film, was also at the London premiere

Scandal: Hawking married his nurse Mrs Mason in 1995 after leaving Wilde four years earlier. They went on to divorce in 2006

The couple became engaged in October 1964 and were married the following July, with  Hawking later saying that the engagement had given him 'something to live for'.

Their eldest child, Robert, was born in 1967, followed by Lucy in 1970 and Timothy in 1979. 

As Hawking's condition declined, he began to require crutches to walk and slowly lost the ability to write. He reluctantly started using a wheelchair in the late 1960s and by the late 1970s his speech could only be understood by family members and close friends.

During a 1985 visit to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research on the border of France and Switzerland, Hawking contracted pneumonia and was so close to death that  Wilde was asked if his life support should be turned off.

She refused and Hawking underwent a tracheotomy which removed what was left of his ability to speak, and left him needing round-the-clock care. One of his nurses was Elaine Mason, played in the film by Maxine Peake, who would go on to become his second wife.

Hawking started using a computer programme called the 'Equalizer', which allows phrases, words or letters to be selected from a collection of around 3,000 - a method he still uses to speak today.

Dapper: Redmayne looked suave in a blue checked suit, white shirt and black tie as he soaked up the attention

Teamwork: The pair's performance has already sparked an Oscar buzz ahead of next year's Academy Awards ceremony

Vision in white: Jones went for a demure long-sleeved Dior lampshade-style dress in white, which she paired with metallic shoes

Eclectic: The daring choice of dress boasted a quilted effect and embroidered detail on the front of one sleeve

Windswept: Jones's full skirt also looked particularly dramatic when the cool breeze ran through Leicester Square

Say cheese! The pair appeared to be in high spirits as they cosied up on the blue carpet for photographs 

The programme used an American accent, and despite the others now available Hawking has said he wants to stick with it as it has become part of his identity. 

Meanwhile, his marriage to Wilde was under increasing strain and in 1990 Hawking told her he was leaving her for Mrs Mason. They divorced in 1995 and he married the nurse that September.

Hawking and Mrs Mason divorced in 2006, after which Hawking's relationship with Ms Wilde, his children and grandchildren improved.   

The cast were also joined by celebrity guests including Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, who looked demure in a short black dress. 

Actress Maxine Peake, who plays Mrs Mason in the movie, was also present.

Hawking, whose most famous work A Brief History of Time helped change the face of cosmology, has already revealed that he was so impressed by Redmayne's performance that he kept mistaking the actor for himself.

He said: 'I thought Eddie Redmayne portrayed me very well. At times I thought he was me. 

'I think Eddie’s commitment will have a big emotional impact,' said the physicist, who shed a tear when he first saw the film. 

Meanwhile, Jones recently revealed that she was taken aback when first meeting twice-married Hawking - because he asked her for a kiss.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'He watched about an hour of filming and Eddie and I were waiting to see what he thought. Then an assistant appeared with a note from Hawking which said: “Would you ask Felicity if she will come and give me a kiss?”

'It showed his rather flirtatious nature and this amazing capacity he has to not take himself too seriously. I loved him.

'It’s so nerve-wracking meeting these people whose lives you are getting so involved with and you don’t want to make a fool of yourself, especially with someone like Stephen who has changed the world in so many ways. Eddie and I just sat there trying to make conversation and not seem like we are total idiots.'

Royal seal of approval: Sarah Ferguson was among the well-heeled guests at the glittering premiere

LBD: The Duchess of York showed off her recent weight-loss in a short black dress with sheer detail, and a pair of platform shoes
