Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas says he will take legal action after allegedly being spied on by Costa Rican government agents.

The country's Judicial Investigation Department (OIJ) revealed 24 government agents had used an 'information platform' to access personal information about the 27-year-old  between July and August 2014.

Navas released a statement on his website, saying: 'I feel outraged, my privacy and that of my family have been violated.

'I have asked my lawyers in Costa Rica to take the necessary legal action.'

OIJ director Francisco Segura said: 'The agents only have the authority to access the platform when they are carrying out police investigations, making their actions at the very least serious infringements that could lead to the sentencing of suspensions upwards of 15 days.' 

Segura also admitted there was no possible justification for anyone to have accessed the information. 

Navas helped Costa Rica reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time this summer, and his performances then earned him a move to European champions Real Madrid.
