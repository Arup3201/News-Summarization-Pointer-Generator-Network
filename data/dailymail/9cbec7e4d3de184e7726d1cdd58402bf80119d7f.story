An Italian nonna who became an internet sensation after her son filmed her trying to use Siri has left Today host Karl Stefanovic in hysterics after she declared the iPhone app was a 'dummy'.

A video of Nonna Paola exploding with rage as she tried to learn how to use her new iPhone was posted online by her son Greg Lachimia, 44, this week.

The 78-year-old, who moved to Victoria from Calabria in Italy 58 years ago, reached online stardom after footage of her trying to ask the voice-recognition application for the time in Italy appeared on Daily Mail Australia.

'To tell you the truth I don't know her. But for me, it's very hard. My son is like push the buttons. I try anything but I can't hear answer properly, you know,' Nonna Paola told Karl Stefanovic on Friday.

Nonna Paola left Today host Karl Stefanovic in hysterics after she declared the iPhone app was a 'dummy'

'Because I don't know, she never answer me what I told her. I tell her what time is it in Italy, but she told me different things, a different story.' 

Nonna Paola struggles to get Siri to answer her questions despite repeated attempts due to her broken English.

'Listen, I no like to say this to her, but for me (she's) like a dummy,' she said after Stefanovic asked if Siri was rude to her. 

The interview with Stefanovic got a little sidetracked when Nonna Paola was asked about her secret to good Italian pasta.

'To do pasta... everyone, especially Australia people love pasta,' she said.

'My kids no like pasta. They want vegetables, steak... especially my son here Greg. Every night (he wants) vegetables and breast chicken. I say one day breast chicken come in your body.'

Nonna Paola even invited Stefanovic over for pasta saying 'any time, no worries'.

But not before she flagged an issue with him over the Today show's money giveaway - I Wake Up With Today.

'I ring you up for wake up with you today and you never ring me. I sit down on the chair like a dummy to hear the phone ring, but you never ring,' she said. 

Greg Lachimia, 44, from Sunshine in Victoria, posts videos of his 78-year-old mother 'Nonna Paola' online

In the latest video Nonna Paola loses as Mr Lachimia tries to teach her how to use Siri on her new iPhone

In the video, Mr Lachimia tells his mother Siri doesn't like her voice - and Nonna Paola loses it. 

'Why no like my voice I talk gently!' she yells.

'Because you very experience for this mobile phone, I'm no experience!'

She tries again, but Siri has trouble understanding her broken English.

'Hello you can tell me what's time it's in Italy please, thank you,' Nonna Paola asks.

Siri replies: 'I value you.'

Mr Lachimia then tries to wind up his mother by telling her to tell Siri to 'p*** off'.

But Nonna Paola quickly fires back: 'No! I no tell p*** off to the people.

'Shut up, you make me sick! No way!

'Listen you no have to be rude to the people, you understand!'

Nonna Paola then makes another unsuccessful attempt at asking Siri the time in Italy.

The application responds by saying: 'I see a handful of Italian restaurant in your area.'

Nonna Paola and Mr Lachimia burst out laughing when she repeatedly calls Siri 'Sira' by mistake.

The iPhone app then responds with a garbled answer, which causes Mr Lachimia to exclaim: 'You confused her, you confused the computer! That's unbelievable!'

But Nonna Paola is quick to yell back: 'You know what you drive me mad, you drive me crazy you d***head!'

In December, Mr Lachimia posted a video of Nonna Paola blowing up after his 12-year-old son told her he was getting a tattoo

That video got more than 4.5 million views, so he decided to create Facebook fan page for Nonna Paola which has almost 30,000 likes

The video was posted to Facebook fan page for Nonna Paola which has almost 30,000 likes and it went viral after appearing on Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Lachimia tried to explain to Nonna Paolo that she was an internet sensation.

'She's a 78-year-old Italian woman - she doesn't get it,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'She's always had the attitude 'so long as she makes people happy'.

'It's all been positive, I've had a cancer patient ring me to say her life has been upside down until she got a hold of mum's page.'

Other videos posted to the page include Nonna Paola trying to learn how to use a digital TV remote, trying to do squats, or losing her temper when it is suggested she get a boyfriend.
