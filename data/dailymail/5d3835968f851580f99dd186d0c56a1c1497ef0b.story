Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy

In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus.

He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. 

Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. 

In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.
