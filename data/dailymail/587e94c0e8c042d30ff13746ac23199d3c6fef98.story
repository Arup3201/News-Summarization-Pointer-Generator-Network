The big news dominating the transfer agenda is the announcement by Real Madrid that they have agreed a deal to sign Norwegian teenage sensation Martin Odegaard in a £2.3million deal.

At just 16, Odegaard had been tracked by some of Europe's top clubs - and trained with both Liverpool and Manchester United - before agreeing to move to Real from Stormsgodset, in the process signing a contract worth £80,000 a week.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 other teenage sensations who the top clubs in Europe at keeping their eyes on...

More than 30 clubs around Europe had been fighting for the signature of the 16-year-old wonderkid

Timo Werner (18, Stuttgart)

There seems to be an almost never-ending list of talented footballers coming through the German youth system, and Timo Werner is just the latest of those.

The 18-year-old forward plies his trade for Stuttgart and has already netted three times in 15 appearances this season.

He made his debut for Stuttgart at the age of just 17 years, four months and 25 days against Botev Plovdiv in the Europa League - a club record - and has scored regularly at every single level of German youth international football.

Mosquito (19, Atletico Paranaense)

Not a normal name for a footballer I'll grant you but Mosquito - AKA Thiago Rodrigues da Silva - excelled during last summer's Toulon Tournament when the Brazil Under 20 side took home the trophy.

He is just 19 but has been involved with the Selecao set-up for more than five years, first alerting European clubs to his talent when he netted 10 goals in seven matches at the U15 South American Championship.

A move to Atletico Paranaense from Vasco da Gama followed and he has already found the back of the net for the South American side. Expect a move across the Atlantic soon...

Fabrice Olinga (18, Apollon Liamssol on loan from Malaga) 

Fabrice Olinga - La Liga's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days and Cameroon's youngster goalscorer (after breaking Samuel Eto'o's record no less). Quite an introduction really.

Inevitably comparisons have been made with Eto'o, Cameroon's greatest striker, and Olinga was even first spotted at his idol's footballing academy.

Malaga bought the 18-year-old in 2009 and, after spending last season at Zulte Waregem, the striker is now on loan at Apollon Limassol in Cyprus where he is honing his skills. Interestingly, his nickname is 'Happy Feet' due to his magnificent dribbling skills and his love of dancing...

Diego Fagundez (19, New England Revolution)

Uruguay aren't short of an exciting player or two at the moment and Diego Fagundez is expected to be the country's next great export.

The 19-year-old plies his trade for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer and the attacking midfielder has established a pretty impressive strike ratio - he has netted 22 times in 96 matches for his club.

Fagundez's super-quick acceleration, superb control and instinctive finishing have made him one of the most-sought after attacking midfielders in world football. Watch this space.

Kelechi Iheanacho (18, Manchester City)

Manchester City have been pumping money into their academy in recent years and forward Kelechi Iheanacho is expected to be one of the success stories to emerge from this big cash injection.

The forward excelled for Man City during their pre-season tour of the United States - scoring against Sporting Kansas City -  and contributed seven assists and six goals for the Nigeria U17 side during their victorious 2013 World Cup campaign.

Yaya Toure has even commented on Iheanacho's talent, explaining: 'Kelechi is an exciting player. I love the way he plays and I feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future.' Praise indeed!

Adnan Januzaj (19, Manchester United)

The Belgian winger needs no introduction to Premier League fans and, despite a difficult start to Louis van Gaal's reign at Manchester United, Adnan Januzaj remains one of the hottest prospects in England.

At 19, Januzaj has already scored four times for the Man United first-team and burst on to the scene when he netted twice in his first start for the club against Sunderland in October 2013.

With six Belgium caps to his name too, Januzaj may well look for pastures new if Van Gaal will not give him game time at Old Trafford - and he will certainly not be short of potential suitors, that's for sure.

Rolando Aarons (19, Newcastle United)

Newcastle United may be enduring a turbulent spell off the field right now but the Magpies have arguably their best crop of youngsters in a generation - most notably the exciting talent that is Rolando Aarons.

The 19-year-old Jamaican-born winger has only made five first-team appearances since his debut earlier this season - largely due to recurring hamstring problems - but he is already courted by a number of top Premier League sides after scoring twice.

His pace, trickery and directness have already drawn comparisons with Raheem Sterling and his brilliant goal against Manchester City in the Capital One Cup proved his potential. Geordies love watching players of Aarons' talent - but Newcastle need to make sure they can keep hold of him.

Ryan Gauld (19, Sporting Lisbon)

One of the surprise transfers of last summer was Ryan Gauld's £3m move from Dundee United to Sporting Lisbon.

The attacking midfielder had scored nine times in 50 appearances for Dundee United before Sporting came calling for the Scotland U21 starlet.

He has since found himself largely playing for Sporting's B side but, after impressing, he made his Primeira Liga debut for the first team earlier this month. Scotland believe they have a real talent of the future on their hands - can Gauld fulfil his true potential?

Zakaria Bakkali (18, PSV Eindhoven) 

The one-cap Belgian international was subject to interest from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid last summer, such is Zakaria Bakkali's talent.

A quick, tricky and in many ways unorthodox winger, Bakkali made the short move to PSV Eindhoven in Holland from Standard Liege in his homeland in 2006.

The 18-year-old netted four times for PSV last season but, after failing to secure a move to Atletico, he was banished to the Dutch side's reserves for refusing to sign a new contract. Atletico and their fellow European giants will almost certainly return for the Moroccan-born youngster.

Leon Goretzka (19, Schalke) 

You know how I said Werner was Germany's next big talent? Yeah well, about that - Leon Goretzka may run him close you know...

At just 19, the Schalke midfielder was named in Joachim Low's provisional squad for Germany's victorious World Cup campaign last year before being cut for the final 23 - but he is regarded by both his national and club coaches as a future heartbeat of their sides.

Having moved to Schalke from Bochum in 2013 - where he was described by coach Peter Neururer as 'the talent of the century' - Goretzka has developed his game to become a classy midfielder who is tactically astute, positionally aware and who can rocket in a shot from the edge of the area. Not bad for a guy who hasn't turned 20 yet, is it?
