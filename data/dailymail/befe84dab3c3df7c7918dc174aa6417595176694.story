Arsenal's new midfield star Francis Coquelin will make Arsene Wenger sweat on his offer of a new contract by waiting to see if he is still in the first team when Jack Wilshere returns from injury next month.

Coquelin is out of contract in the summer and his outstanding performance in the 2-0 win at Manchester City last weekend means that he is now being courted by Premier League rivals and by clubs in his native France.

Arsenal have offered the holding midfielder a new deal but with the club lining up a summer bid for Borussia Dortmund’s Ilkay Gundogan, with Wilshere back from injury in mid February and with Mikel Arteta expected to sign a one-year extension, Coquelin’s first- team opportunities look limited.

But Coquelin is waiting to see if he'll still be in the side following the return from injury of Jack Wilshere

Coquelin, 23, has been at Arsenal since he was 17 and wants to stay at the club - but only if he is in Wenger’s plans for the first team.

He was already resigned to leaving this summer until Wilshere’s injury brought an unexpected recall from his loan spell at Charlton last month.

Coquelin has since started in five games, four of which Arsenal have won, conceding just three goals.

The Frenchman was widely praised for bringing defensive discipline to Arsenal’s often cavalier approach to games after the unexpected 2-0 win at City.

But with just five months left on his deal, Arsenal may have left it too late to convince him to stay and risk losing him on a free transfer as they did with Bacary Sagna and Mathieu Flamini.

Wilshere is slightly ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation and is expected back in mid February. If Coquelin were to find himself dropped, he would almost certainly have to leave in the summer to ensure more playing time.
