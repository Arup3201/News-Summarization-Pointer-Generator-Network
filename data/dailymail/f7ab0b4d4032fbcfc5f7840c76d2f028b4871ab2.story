Roseanna Langley, 24, bombarded the 16-year-old with hundreds of texts and naked photos during the six-week affair

A woman teacher who had an illicit relationship with a 16-year-old pupil was spared jail yesterday despite a judge telling her that she had groomed the boy for sex.

Roseanna Langley, 24, sent hundreds of explicit text messages and photographs to the pupil’s phone, took him away to London for a romantic weekend and even lied about being pregnant in order to prolong the affair.

The science teacher’s text messages included ‘Baby please let me tie you up tomorrow it’s so sexy’ and ‘babe I love planning our future together’.

She told the boy she planned to have his name tattooed on her body and discussed getting married, buying a dog and having children together.

Exeter Crown Court heard that she had abused her position of trust to spark a sexual relationship with the boy between January and March, shortly after her engagement to another man had ended.

Pupils at the school became aware of the relationship after Langley invited students to her house to watch films.

They said she and the boy kissed and cuddled before going to her bedroom.

Among the 1,500 texts the pair exchanged was an assurance from Langley that she ‘didn’t care if she got sacked so long as they could be together’.

Last month, Langley, from Exeter, pleaded guilty to two offences of sexual activity with a male aged 13 to 17 while in a position of trust.

Despite claiming the relationship was
over, she was arrested this week after being spotted in a car with the 
teenager. However, police said she had not breached her bail conditions 
because the boy is no longer a pupil at St James High School in Exeter 
and that she had been sacked.

'I am told you had wanted to be a teacher since you were a child. You have destroyed that. You will never teach children again'

- Recorder Paul Dunkels, QC 

Langley, wearing a smart black 
trouser suit, sobbed in the dock as Recorder Paul Dunkels gave her an 
eight-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, ordered her to do 
150 hours’ community work and to attend a sex offenders’ course.

She will also be placed on the sex 
offenders’ register for ten years and will be barred from working with 
children and young people indefinitely.

he judge told her: ‘You were drawn 
to this boy in the emotional aftermath of your fiancé ending his 
relationship with you, but that does not excuse your conduct in any way.

‘Your actions were selfish and 
motivated by a need to boost your own damaged self-esteem by encouraging
him to have a sexual interest in you. You groomed him and when his 
interest in you faltered you sent him text messages and explicit 
photographs to rekindle his sexual interest.

Roseanna Langley was given a suspended sentence of eight months and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work at Exeter Crown Court

‘You lied to him and intimated you 
were pregnant with his child and had miscarried. That was manipulative 
emotional blackmail intended to put pressure on him.

‘You did that without any thought for
the emotional damage you might inflict on him. You were reckless not 
only with your own career and your liberty but careless for this boy’s 
well-being. You were selfishly exploiting him when you were in a 
position of trust.

‘You are an intelligent young woman. 
You knew the risks you were taking but you abandoned all self-discipline
and judgment.

'I am told you had wanted to be a teacher since you were a
child. You have destroyed that. You will never teach children again.’

Kelly Scrivener, defending, said 
Langley had genuine remorse over the affair and that the boy was already
sexually experienced when he met her.

She said Langley had not met the boy 
through school but because she is a friend of his older sister, who had 
comforted her after her break-up with her fiancé.

Miss Scrivener said Langley had not 
taught the boy or had any mentoring role and had only had sex with him 
when he was over the age of consent.

She added: ‘This was not a teacher preying on a vulnerable student. There was no pressure or coercion.

‘She feels she has let down her 
employers and her parents. She has thrown away her career. She knows she
should have said no and told him they could not get into a 
relationship. From the age of ten, all she has wanted to be is a 
teacher.

‘He is now 16 and no longer at school and she is able to have a relationship with him legally if that is what they both want.’

She said Langley now wanted to begin a new career as a carer.
