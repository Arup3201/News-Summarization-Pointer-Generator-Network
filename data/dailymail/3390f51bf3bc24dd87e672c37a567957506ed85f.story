The hotly anticipated remake of Annie is one of five Sony movies being illegally shared online after a cyber attack allegedly committed by North Korea in revenge for a new Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy.

The attack allegedly knocked out Sony Pictures Entertainment's entire computer network earlier this week, with staff reduced to working off white boards because their laptops and PC were rendered useless.

The hack comes just under a month before Sony Pictures is due to release The Interview, which is a comedy about two journalists, played by Rogen and Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June.

Representatives of the North Korean mission to the United Nations could not immediately be reached for comment about the cyber attack.

In addition to Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, which is due to hit theaters on December 19, Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury, is also being openly traded and downloaded online.

By Sunday morning, Fury, which is still playing in theaters, had been downloaded 1.2 million times and Annie had been downloaded 206,000 times from unique IP addresses, according to Variety.

Other Sony movies being downloaded include 'Mr. Turner,' 'Still Alice' and 'To Write Love on Her Arms.'

Sony Pictures' computer system went down on Monday. Before screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase 'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of Peace, the Los Angeles Times said.

The hackers also warned they would release 'secrets' stolen from the Sony servers, the Times reported. 

According to one insider who spoke to industry website, TheWrap, 'Every PC in the company is useless and all of the content files have either been stolen or destroyed or locked away.'

No demands have been issued by the hackers but a Reddit thread outlined the data allegedly mined by the Guardians of Peace.

This includes A-list actors' passports, their bank details, salaries for film appearances, their password information and also email correspondences.

According to the Reddit thread, the actors who have had their data compromised included Jonah Hill, Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie.

According to website Re/code, Sony and security consultants were investigating the possibility that someone acting on behalf of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible for the hacking attack.

Re/code said a link to North Korea had not been confirmed but it had not been ruled out.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Sony Pictures was investigating every possibility, adding no link to North Korea has been uncovered.

Sony acknowledged the computer outage in a statement on Tuesday. 

Emails to Sony were bouncing back on Saturday with a message asking senders to contact employees by telephone because its email system was 'experiencing a disruption.'

'The Interview,' scheduled for release in the United States on December 25, stars James Franco as the host of a tabloid television show that is enjoyed by Kim, and Seth Rogen as the show's producer.

When they are granted a rare interview with Kim, the CIA wants to turn them into assassins.

KCNA, the official news agency in isolationist North Korea, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman in June as promising a 'merciless counter-measure' if the film is released. 

The government also wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama asking him to stop it, the Voice of America reported.
