A mother and her three daughters are giving a new meaning to the term Land Girls by taking over the running of a farm following the death of their husband and father.

When farmer Michael Besent sadly died from cancer four years ago, his grieving wife Carol, 52, decided to carry on the family business rather than give it up.

And while mourning the untimely loss of their father, his three daughters backed their mother’s decision by going to work on the 700 acre mixed arable farm as well.

Farm girls: L-R Harriet, 25, Carol, 52, Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, run the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy family farm in the heart of Dorset

Now the four women are pulling up trees in the largely male-dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business.

Carol runs the farm with middle daughter Harriet, who has a university degree in agricultural studies, and has roped in daughters Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, for manual labour.

The four women are now in one of their busiest times of the year when they bring in the harvest of 250 acres of barley and wheat, a task that requires 14 hour days.

Katy operates the combine harvester while Harriet, 25, drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn.

Success story: The four women are pulling up trees in the largely male-dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business

Tragic: Carol's husband died four years ago and rather than give up the family farm Carol and her daughters have taken the unusual step of running the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy farm themselves

In charge: Carol runs the farm with middle daughter Harriet, who has a university degree in agricultural studies, and has roped in daughters Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, for manual labour

Georgina takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk, it’s a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn.

Higher Melcombe Farm, in the village of Ansty, near Dorchester, Dorset, was run by Michael’s father, Peter, who called the business Besent and Sons.

The irony of the name has not been lost on Carol who has considered renaming it Besent and Daughters but decided not to in honour of her late husband.

Harriet had intended to work on the farm and manage it one day after being taught the ropes by her father but she found herself thrown in at the deep end after he died.

Home farm: Harriet, 25, is in charge of the day to day running of the family farm

Milking it: Georgina takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk, it's a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn

Behind the wheel: Katy operates the combine harvester while Harriet, 25, drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn

She said: 'It would have been easy to give the farm up after dad died but that would have meant his life’s work would have just gone.

'Carrying and sometimes struggling on makes us all feel closer to him in some way.

'I hope he would be pleased and proud of what we are doing and keeping the farm in the Besent name.'

Mother Carol said: 'There is quite a troop of us. We are all blonde and all females and I think what we are doing has surprised quite a few people.

'Many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms aren’t traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently.

'But there aren’t many things that the girls can’t do although sometimes we need a little brawn and we do have a dairyman for that.

Loss: Their father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50. At the time Harriet was about to start her final year at Newcastle University while Katy was doing her A-Levels

Close: The girls say that sarrying and sometimes struggling on makes them all feel closer to their late father in some way

Non-conventional: 'Many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms aren't traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently,' they say

'Delivery drivers often turn up and start addressing the dairyman thinking that he is in charge but it raises a few eyebrows when he tells them they should be talking to Harriet.

'I am sure Michael would be terribly proud of us all, the girls especially. To cope with the death of your father and have to run a 700 acre farm on top of that is an awful lot to deal with.'

Michael Besent was aged nine when he moved onto Higher Melcombe Farm with his parents, Peter and Mary.

He took over the running of the business with Carol after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters.

But he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50.

At the time Harriet was about to start her final year at Newcastle University while Katy was doing her A-Levels.

Home: Michael Besent was aged nine when he moved onto Higher Melcombe Farm with his parents, Peter and Mary and now the girls have taken over

Family: Their father took over the running of the business with Carol after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters

Carol said: 'Harriet planned to come home and eventually run the farm but unfortunately my husband died too soon and she missed out on being shown the ropes in terms of managing the farm.'

Harriet said: 'It is not just our gender that surprises a few people but also our age.

'When I tell people that I am a farmer that don’t take it seriously and think I have a hobby farm with a few ponies.'

Georgina has trained to be a schoolteacher and is about to start her first job in teaching but has spent the summer mucking in on the farm.

Katy has recently completed a degree in environmental geo-sciences at Bristol University and has returned to the farm to help out.

Tough job: 'When I tell people that I am a farmer that don't take it seriously and think I have a hobby farm with a few ponies,' says Carol

Busy: It is a busy time of year because the girls have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting

Carol said: 'This is a very busy time of year because we have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting and we are an autumn calving farm as well.

'Katy drives the combine harvester and she has to grease it and fuel it as well and Harriet drives the tractor and trailer to take the corn off the combine.

'Harriet is up at 5am and feeds the animals and we then have breakfast and talk about what jobs need doing on the farm that day.'
