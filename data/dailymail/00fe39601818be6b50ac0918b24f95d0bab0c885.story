Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock admits that being a manager is sometimes like 'wearing a permanent gag', and that he can't wait until he retires so he can let loose and voice what he really thinks.

Warnock faces an FA hearing on Wednesday after he was charged with misconduct for claiming referee Craig Pawson was ‘influenced’ by Chelsea’s players during their victory at Selhurst Park.

And the 65-year-old was at the centre of a storm this week when referee Mark Clattenburg was stood down from Premier League games after speaking to Warnock on the phone after officiating Palace’s game against West Brom last weekend.

Warnock is adamant he did nothing wrong on that occasion but says the threat of disciplinary action means managers rarely give honest opinions as they look to avoid a heavy fine.

‘Do I feel like I’m wearing a permanent gag? Well I think the FA disciplinary department are quite happy with that, really,’ said Warnock, whose side host Sunderland tomorrow.

‘I am looking forward to going back on Talksport and BT after [I’ve retired], when you can say what you want and enjoy it.

‘I have to learn to adjust, because I do think people want to hear your opinions. They don’t want people always sat on the fence being boring.

‘You have the disciplinary committee looking at everything you do, and I don’t think we owe it to keep them in a job.

‘Unfortunately there is a time and a place to say it and I have to learn what I can say and when I can say it.’
