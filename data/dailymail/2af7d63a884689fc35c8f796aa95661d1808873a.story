With expansive terraces, outdoor showers and loungers positioned to soak up every single ray of light, these spectacular apartments would not look out of place in sun-kissed California.

However, the £6million penthouses are not to be found in the world's technology capital Silicon Valley.

Instead they nestle in the rather less temperate climes of Silicon Roundabout, a traffic-snarled hub in London which is home to some of Britain's most forward thinking companies.

Whether designers who worked on the 12-storey tower realised quite how little light future owners would get is anybody's guess.

But should the sun deem to grace the East End with its presence, residents can enjoy huge terraces split into separate living, leisure and dining areas which 
include outdoor showers, sun loungers, a television and even a gas fire.

The recently-renovated apartments, known as Penthouse 122 and Penthouse 127, are being billed as 'the finest uber-prime residences in the City of London' by developers Tudorvale.

The outside areas, which total more than 1,300 sq/ft, also feature an eight-person jacuzzi, an outside kitchen with a barbecue, raised bar and fridge.

The al fresco living quarters are more customary in countries such as Australia but the developer believes they can be hit in the UK as well.

Tudorvale says the Bezier penthouses' 'design and mix of facilities gives the ambience of an exclusive private member's club'.

The developer says it is not just a 
home, 'but an exceptional place to entertain and meet friends, exercise,
 have lunch, relax or network with business colleagues'.

Faith: The developers Tudorvale believe the outside living areas, more common in warmer countries, will prove to be a success

No expense spared: The properties are going on the market for up to £5.75million

Unique: Each terrace is split into separate living, leisure and dining areas

Features: Some of the outdoor amenities include a shower, sun lounging area and an eight-person jacuzzi

Outdoor pursuits: The terraces also have a living area with an outside television and gas fire and a dining area along which boasts a barbecue, raised bar and fridge

Eamon Lyons, managing director of 
Tudorvale, added: 'These luxury-brand themed Bezier penthouses are 
magnificent and have their own unique design and highly distinctive 
features.

'They provide superb quality and are 
quite simply the finest uber-prime residences in the City of London 
region: nothing of equivalent quality exists in the local housing 
market.'

Both flats, which have a 24-hour 
concierge and two parking spaces, have a system which controls all 
lighting, heating, air conditioning, TVs and blinds.

The penthouse flats are officially launched on June 19.

Penthouse 122, which is inspired by Hermes, has a 2,476sq/ft interior and 1,586sq/ft terrace - and comes with a £5.5 million price-tag.

For £5.75 million, the Fendi-themed Penthouse 127 provides 2,639sq/ft of interior space laid out over two floors, as well as a private terrace of 1,372sq/ft.
