Cameron Diaz has railed against our obsession with youth and claimed women feel like they have ‘failed’ if they look old.

The 41-year-old There’s Something About Mary star said that it is ‘crazy’ how women are under pressure to look like they are 25 even when they are more mature.

She said that women ‘don’t give ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly told they have to ‘defy nature’.

Her looks are the envy of thousands of women, and Cameron admits she feels pressure to remain looking young, saying she now regrets having had Botox

Diaz herself has in the past fallen victim to the guilt she describes and has had Botox which she regrets as it changed her face in a ‘weird way’.

She had a nose job after breaking it four times and has spoken about her battle with acne, revealing that she tried everything from makeup to medication to make it go away.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Diaz became the latest Hollywood star in recent weeks to talk about the process of aging.

Diaz said: ‘For me I feel like if I - it is almost as if we have failed if we don't remain 25 for the rest of our lives.

‘Like we are failures. It is a personal failure. Like our fault that at 40 years old that I still don't look like I'm 25.’

Diaz has just released her lifestyle guide The Body Book which champions a healthy way of living

Feigning indignation, she said: ‘Oh, I'm sorry. I apologise, I wasn't able to defy nature.’

Diaz agreed with Winfrey that everyone's trying to be ‘back there,’ in the past.

She said: ‘Women don't allow other women to age gracefully, and we don't give ourselves permission to age gracefully, everybody’s judging.’ 

Cameron, pictured aged 26 in her breakthrough role in There's Something About Mary, spoke about how women feel they have somehow failed if they don't look like they are in their 20s

Diaz, who has just released her lifestyle guide The Body Book, gave the interview weeks after Sharon Stone spoke out about how she ‘wanted to die’ when she put on weight in her 20s.

The Basic Instinct star, 55, said that she cried uncontrollably after being taunted by men who wolf whistled at her curves and larger breasts.

In a frank interview she also said that years later she suffered a relapse and teared up in the  bathroom with a bottle of wine as she told herself: ‘I’m not coming out until I can totally accept the way I look.’
