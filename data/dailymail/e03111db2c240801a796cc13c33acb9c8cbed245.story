Junior was 'a kind, ambitious, humble, reliable, caring, friendly boy' his mother said

A girl of 14 who ordered a teenager to be stabbed for being ‘disrespectful’ was found guilty of manslaughter yesterday.

The teenager said 15-year-old Junior Nkwelle ‘should be punished’ following a row over a game of football and he died after her 16-year-old boyfriend thrust a carving knife once into his chest.

Both were cleared of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey yesterday, but they are facing long prison terms after being  found guilty of manslaughter.

Junior’s mother, Stella Muma, collapsed in tears after the verdicts and had to be comforted by friends and relatives.

She said afterwards: ‘All he wanted to do was play football with his friends and be left alone. He certainly didn’t deserve to have his young, innocent life taken away.’

The court heard how Junior lost his life following a ‘trivial’ argument as he played football with friends on a patch of grass near his home in Brixton, South London.

The girl claimed Junior had insulted her during the row, which broke out after she walked across the middle of the pitch with her friends.

She then called her boyfriend, who is now 17, and ordered him to ‘teach Junior a lesson’, the court was told.

Witnesses said they heard the girl boasting that she had arranged for someone to stab the teenager and she later went home to fetch a kitchen knife.

When her boyfriend arrived on the scene, he was handed the blade and used it to stab Junior once, piercing his heart and lung.

The youngster collapsed yards from his housing estate home in September last year and was pronounced dead an hour later.

Prosecutor Jonathan Turner QC said the argument ‘was stupid  and trivial and completely unnecessary’.

‘It was loud enough to be heard by neighbours,’ he added. ‘Words were said, voices were raised and threats were made.

‘She thought that Junior had insulted 
her or been less than respectful to her. She was very angry and 
determined that he should be punished – indeed stabbed – to put things 
right.

‘She called up her boyfriend and was heard to tell Junior that she had arranged for somebody to come and stab him.’

The girl had been angry and determined that Junior should be punished to put things right, the Old Bailey heard

Mr Turner added: ‘He (the defendant) was encouraged and requested by her to come and do this. Indeed, to use an old-fashioned phrase, was set up by her to do this.’ The 17-year-old killer, from Herne Hill, South London, claimed he was acting as a peacemaker and knifed Junior in self-defence.

Both he and the girl, from Brixton, were given anonymity during the trial. Judge Richard Hone will decide whether to reveal their identities when they are sentenced on April 5.

Mrs Muma said she is still haunted by visions of her dying son. She added: ‘It makes me feel so angry. It happened so quickly and so close to our home.

‘I didn’t even know what was going on and I had no chance to help, or see him and say goodbye and tell him how much I love him because by the time I got to him my poor child had bled to death.

'I wake every day and see where my boy was killed, the vision of him lying on the floor wounded, breathless, motionless, and bleeding as the paramedics tried to save him, a horrific vision that is engraved in my mind.

‘There have been many days I can’t face even going outside as the reminder of what has happened is too painful.

‘I always thought my boys would have to bury me one day, not this way around.’

Detective Chief Inspector Charles King, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘The death of Junior Nkwelle illustrates the terrible consequences of what appears to be the casual acceptance that knives have a part to play in minor disputes between young people in some parts of our community.’
