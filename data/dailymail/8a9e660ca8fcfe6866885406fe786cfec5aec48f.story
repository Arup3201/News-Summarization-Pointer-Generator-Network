A fairground ride owner has appeared in court accused of breaching safety laws after a nine-year-old girl was seriously injured when she was flung 15ft from her seat.

Patrick McGeough was operating the twister when Yasmin Vickery came flying off it - colliding with a metal barrier in front of her horrified mother, Kim.

Shocking mobile phone footage taken by Kim, 41, shows the moment Yasmin was catapulted into the air.

Yasmin Vickery, 9, was treated for a suspected broken neck after the horrifying ordeal on November 3, 2012

Her mother, Kim, captured the incident on her mobile phone camera and believed that her daughter would be paralysed for the rest of her life

Mr McGeough was running the ride at 50mph - 50 per cent faster than its recommended maximum speed, Northampton Magistrates' Court heard.

The prosecution have also suggested that he failed to ensure the machine's secondary locks were done up during the incident at Northampton's Hollowell Steam Rally and Heavy Horse Show on November 3, 2012. 

After being thrown from the ride, Yasmin was treated for a suspected broken neck and was rushed to hospital, accompanied by her mother - who feared her daughter would be paralysed for life.

Miraculously, she escaped the terrifying ordeal with severe bruising only and was able to leave hospital a day later.

Mr McGeough has been charged with breaching section 33 of the Health and Safety Act 2008 while operating the Edwin Hall twister ride.

Yesterday, he gave no indication of what he will plead during the short hearing and was ordered to come back to the court in December.

During the video taken by Kim, a loud thud can clearly be heard as Yasmin slams into a metal fence.

The film shows the emergency button being pressed and the ride grinding to a halt while a frantic Kim can be heard asking 'Where’s Yasmin?'

Miraculously, Yasmin escaped with severe bruising  

After the incident, Kim, a company secretary, described the distressing moment she feared her daughter was dead.

She said: 'Yamsin had been on the ride with her little cousin Kya and the bar came up, as she went to lean to pull it back she came flying off.

'She spun into the air because it was going so fast, then you could hear this almighty thud. She had gone flying through the barrier.

'I was filming the ride and didn’t notice until the ride stopped what had happened, we were laughing and joking at the time.

'But then I just saw my little girl in a heap over the other side. My six-year-old daughter Talisha who had been watching was in tears, she was petrified - she thought her sister was dead.

'When I ran across and Yasmin said she couldn’t feel her legs - I thought she was paralysed, she could have quite easily have died but she took the brunt of the force on her side rather then her head.

'The impact was sideways, but the paramedics said if she had gone through head first she probably wouldn't be here.

'Most people wouldn't survive a car crash at that speed, let alone being thrown through the air off a ride.'
