Body found: Police said they found a body they think is Anna Marie Smith, 18, who disappeared earlier this month

A body has been found in the hunt for a female freshman who went missing just outside her campus days after telling her parents she'd been attacked.

The remains of Anna Marie Smith, an 18-year-old student at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, were found in woodland near where she was last seen on the night of September 2.

Police in Boone confirmed the discovery today, saying: 'Initial evidence indicates the deceased person found today is Anna Marie Smith'.

They had been led to the inaccessible point, surrounded by trees and bushes, after a local reported a suspicious stench, according to the Charlotte Observer.

Officers said they found a driver's license and university ID by the body, though they did not comment on how she might have died.

During the early stages of the 10-day manhunt it emerged that Miss Smith had told her parents that she had been attacked days before her disappearance.

She told her family that she had been at a party with around five other students on August 27, and had been attacked later that evening.

She said she could not remember the incident well - and also could not think of a reason for the assault. 

Dan and Laurie Smith, Miss Smith's parents, mentioned the incident but did not provide full details because they said it may harm the police investigation. 

Officers added there was 'no evidence' for a sexual element to the attack.

Miss Smith was last spotted by the driver of a free transit service which moves students around the town after dark.

A woman called the Mountaineer SafeRide van from an events venue in the town to Mountaineer Hall, a student housing block on campus.

She and friends then took the journey - though the bus driver reportedly told police she could not be certain the woman who got on board was Miss Smith.

Mr Smith had headed to Appalachian State to visit his daughter that evening to bring her a laptop and cell phone which she had left at home in High Point, about 200 miles from Boone.

Identification: Police say initial evidence suggests that the woman's body is that of Miss SMith

Crime scene: Police cordoned off an area in Boone near where the body was discovered this morning

He arrived at her dorm room on the evening of September 3, almost exactly as she was officially declared missing. 

She was reported missing the following day, sparking a huge search. Police, including dog units, and volunteers combed the area around the campus, but nothing had been found until this evening.

The discovery was also confirmed by Sheri Everts, the chancellor of Appalachian State.

She wrote: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with Anna’s family and loved ones during this very difficult time. Having one of our own missing struck the Appalachian community very hard, and this very sad news is heartbreaking for us all.

'The loss of Anna will continue to weigh heavy on our hearts... We had hoped so much that this search would end differently, yet all of these efforts underscore our belief in just how integral each of us is to this community.' 

Disappeared: Miss Smith had called for a bus to get her across campus on the evening of September 2, and had not been seen since

Discovery: Police said they found a university ID card and a driver's license with Miss Smith's name along with the body

Searches: Police, including dog units, as well as volunteers from campus and beyond had joined the 11-day search

'Struck us hard': Sheri Everts, the Chancellor of Appalachian State, posted a message to students telling of their collective grief

There are plans for a memorial book to be set up on campus for students to share their memories of Miss Smith.

Mourners began posting tributes and messages of condolence to a Facebook page set up to help co-ordinate her search.

One said: 'There are no words to express the sadness that I felt when I read that she had been found. May God wrap his arms around you and hold you close during this difficult time.'

Another added: 'Praying for your family during this very devastating time.'
