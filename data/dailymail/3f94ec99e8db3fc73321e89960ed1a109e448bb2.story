A review of the evidence used to convict Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing has confirmed beyond doubt he was responsible for the killings, it has been claimed.

Sources close to the review, carried out by the Crown Office and Police Scotland, have said there is 'not a shred of evidence' to support suggestions he was wrongly convicted.

The Libyan intelligence officer was convicted in 2001 for killing 270 people in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but more than two decades on, there are lingering suspicions he was a scapegoat used to cover up the involvement of other Middle Eastern countries.

Here Megrahi is pictured being escorted by security officers through Tripoli in 1992. A new review of the case against him has found there is not a 'shred of evidence' to support conspiracy claims

It's also been claimed his imprisonment was a price worth paying by Libya for the lifting of crippling sanctions, imposed for several years after Megrahi was identified in Scotland and the US as the likely bomber.

However, sources close to the recent review have told The Times that pursuit of the case in Libya only confirmed the evidence against Megrahi  - and even further implicated Lamin Fhimah, who was originally accused but acquitted.

Police claim any planting of evidence to frame Megrahi would needed to have been done within a very short space of time and furthermore, it would require knowledge of all the evidence in the case still to come, the paper reported.

Megrahi died two years ago after being controversially released from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer.

His release, based on the understanding he had only three months to live, caused outrage in the U.S., which lost 189 citizens in the terrorist attack.

Relatives in the US said they remained convinced that Megrahi had been freed to appease the Libyan government, smoothing the way for a string of lucrative deals.

At the time, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said: 'The whole deal smelled of a deal for oil for this man’s freedom. I still believe that the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, created a major injustice when they let him out.'

A year after his death, it was revealed Megrahi's release was linked to a £400million arms deal with Libya.

Documents showed 'reprehensible' connections between the Labour government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of Britain’s worst terrorist atrocity.

An email sent by the then UK ambassador in Tripoli to former premier Tony Blair explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once Libya 'fulfils its promise' to buy an air defence system.
