A 20-year-old woman escaped from her car after it caught fire and automatically locked the doors and windows.

Lauren Zajac, was driving from work in Clapham, South London to her family home in Sidmouth, Devon, when the engine of her Vauxhall Tigra exploded into flames.

However, Miss Zajac acted quickly by turning on the car's engine, unlocking the driver's door and leaping out of the vehicle safely.

This was the first and only time she has driven the second hand car, which she bought the day before.

The burning Vauxhall Tigra, just moments after Miss Zajac escaped. The seven-year-old vehicle had been bought from a second hand dealer the day before

Miss Zajac said she spent 'too much' on the second-hand Vauxhall Tigra.

The car's alarm system triggered an automatic lock, leaving Miss Zajac trapped inside her vehicle.

She re-started the engine so she could open the door and flee the scene, just seconds before the car exploded.

She said: 'I'm lucky to be alive. It was absolutely terrifying. It was a real nightmare and I'm just thankful to still be around.

'I was driving into Sidmouth and the car just caught fire.

'I went to slow down but the alarm system went off and it shut down and locked me in.

'I tried to smash the window, but it was really difficult and I was panicking.

'It was very scary and I was terrified.

'Luckily I managed to start the car and jumped out while it was still moving.

'It was like something out of James Bond.

'I literally had seconds before the whole car blew up.'

Miss Zajac, who works as a marketing area manager, suffered burns to her legs from the blaze but says she was lucky to have sustained minor injuries.

She ran to a nearby friend's house to get help and firefighters were called to the scene near Sidmouth, Devon.

She lost £1,400 worth of belongings in the burnt-out car, including an iPhone and clothes.

The 20-year-old said she paid 'too much' for the second hand car, which she won't be able to drive again.

'There were no windows or tyres left. It was completely burnt out. I'm fully insured so that's something.

'I'm just pleased to have got out in one piece. They weren't bad burns so I got away very lightly.

'My car was gutted and I lost £1,400 worth of belongings, including my iPhone, clothes and satnav, said Lauren.

It is believed that the seven-year-old Vauxhall Tigra was leaking petrol and
oil during the drive from London to Devon.

Miss Zajac said: 'It didn't look like there was anything wrong with it when I bought it. I'd only bought the car 16 hours earlier in London and it was my first journey in it.

'It
must be something to do with me and cars because I wrote off my last 
one, a Ford Fiesta, after rolling it. I just can't believe it.'
