Thousands of people have been evacuated from across the central Philippines today with what is expected to be the year's strongest typhoon set to strike the region in the early hours of tomorrow morning.

Typhoon Haiyan has intensified and accelerated as it moves closer to the country with sustained winds of 225kph (140 mph) and ferocious gusts of 260 kph (162 mph).

One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month.

Preparation: Filipino fishermen haul a wooden boat ashore in in Ormoc city in the island of Leyte as Typhoon Haiyan approaches

Impact: The Typhoon is expected to hit the coast of the Philippines at 9am on Friday morning

Haiyan could further strengthen and pick up speed as it moves over the Pacific Ocean before slamming into the eastern province of Samar early Friday, government forecaster Buddy Javier said.

As of 9pm the eye of the typhoon was 338 kilometers (211 miles) southeast of Eastern Samar province's Guiuan township. The storm was moving at 39kph (24mph), up from its earlier speed of 33 kph (20mph).

The storm was not expected to directly hit Manila further north. The lowest alert in a four-level typhoon warning system was issued in the flood-prone capital area, meaning it could experience winds of up to 60 kph (37 mph) and rain.

The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii said it was the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year.

Cyclone Phailin, which hit eastern India on Oct. 12, packed sustained winds of up to 222 kph (138 mph) and stronger gusts.

President Benigno Aquino III warned people to leave high-risk areas, including 100 coastal communities where forecasters said the storm surge could reach up to seven meters (23 feet). He urged seafarers to stay in port.Â 

Authorities warned more than 12 million people were at risk from Haiyan which is more powerful than the typhoon which hit India last month

Aquino also assured the public of war-like preparations: three C-130 air force cargo planes and 32 military helicopters and planes on standby, along with 20 navy ships.

'No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united,' he said in a televised address.

Governors and mayors supervised the evacuation of landslide- and flood-prone communities in several provinces where the typhoon is expected to pass, said Eduardo del Rosario, head of the government's main disaster-response agency. School classes and plane flights were canceled in many areas.

Aquino ordered officials to aim for zero casualties, a goal often not met in an archipelago lashed by about 20 tropical storms each year, most of them deadly and destructive. Haiyan is the 24th such storm to hit the Philippines this year.

Edgardo Chatto, governor of Bohol island province in the central Philippines, where an earthquake in October killed more than 200 people, said soldiers, police and rescue units were helping displaced residents, including thousands staying in small tents, move to shelters.

Bohol is not forecast to receive a direct hit but is expected to be battered by strong winds and rain, government forecaster Jori Loiz said.

'My worst fear is that the eye of this typhoon will hit us. I hope we will be spared,' Chatto told The Associated Press by telephone.

One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month

Gov. Roger Mercado of landslide-prone Southern Leyte province said more than 6,000 residents had been evacuated to shelters, government and emergency personnel had been put on alert, and relief goods have been packed for distribution.

'All we are doing now is we are praying, praying hard,' he told ABS-CBN News Channel.

Mayor Emiliana Villacarillo of Eastern Samar's Dolores township said residents of her town did not want to be evacuated because the weather was fine on

Thursday but 'we forced them and hauled them to evacuation centers.'

Haiyan is forecast to barrel through the country's central region Friday and Saturday before blowing toward the South China Sea over the weekend, heading toward Vietnam.
