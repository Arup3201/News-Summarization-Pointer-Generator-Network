Finland has become the final Nordic country to legalise same-sex marriage after an equal rights bill was passed in parliament today.  

Victory cheers erupted in central Helsinki where thousands of human rights activists had gathered outside Parliament ahead of the vote.

Gay couples in Finland have been able to enter into registered partnerships since 2002, but will now have the same rights as heterosexual married couples, and will be able  adopt children and share a surname.

Laws governing marriage are now completely gender-neutral in the Scandinavian nation, which has a population of some 5.4 million.

Supporters of the bill hugged after speaker Eero Heinäluoma closed the session, and some MPs cried leaving the floor of the House. 

'Finland should strive to become a society where discrimination does not exist, human rights are respected and two adults can marry regardless of their sexual orientation,' centre-right Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said in an open letter before the vote. 

Finland becomes the 12th European state to allow gay marriage, but the last in the Nordic region to do so.

It is an important move for Finland in taking a stand against its increasingly anti-gay neighbour Russia and joining forces with the rest of Scandinavia.

Most opponents argued that all children should have the right to a father and mother. 

'This is a question of the future of our children and the whole society, and such changes should not be made without thorough evaluation of their impact,' Mika Niikko of the nationalist Sannfinlandarna (TrueFinns party) said before the vote. 

In the vote, 105 members of parliament supported the legal amendment while 92 opposed it. 

The vote came after a petition signed by 167,000 Finnish people was handed over to Parliament in December last year.
