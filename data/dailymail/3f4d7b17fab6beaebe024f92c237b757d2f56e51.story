Hamburg have confirmed their interest in Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby but the London club have yet to receive a formal approach. 

The 23-year-old, who has three years remaining on his contract, is part of Mauricio Pochettino's plans and trained with the squad on Tuesday but he has plenty of interest as Premier League and foreign clubs sense a loan deal. 

Hamburg director Dietmar Beiersdorf told the German press: 'I’d be lying if I said we have nothing to do with Holtby.'

Bundesliga return: But the club have yet to receive a formal request for the German

Tottenham youngster Tomislav Gomelt is in talks over a loan move to Italian side Bari.

The Croatia Under 19 midfielder joined Spurs from Liga 2 side NK HASK and had spells out on loan at Royal Antwerp and Espanyol last season.

Palermo striker Abel Hernandez is scheduled to have a medical at Hull City on Wednesday after the clubs agreed a £9.5million price.

The 24-year-old turned down a move to Benfica and stated that he 'wanted to try a different league.'

He took a flight to Hull on a private plane in the morning. A four-year contract offer has been submitted to the striker, reportedly worth £1.2million for the first year rising to £2million for the fourth.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Hernandez said: 'My future? Maurizio Zamparini told me that after the promotion to Serie A, he would let me leave. Do I want to quit Palermo? It can happen, but there’s nothing to say I don’t want to stay. We’ll see what happens.'

Too costly: Steve Bruce was looking to sign Blackburn's Jordan Rhodes but lost patience

Sunderland had also shown an interest in Hernandez while other clubs have been keen on a loan.

Manager Steve Bruce had wanted to sign Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes but the Championship club's reluctance to sell has slowed down negotiations and Hull can't afford to take too many chances with the window closing plus other clubs frantically searching for the same calibre of striker.

Hernandez, 24, is a Uruguay international and has an impressive record for his country having scored seven goals in 14 games. His record at Palermo is closer to one every three games. He is 6ft 1in, fast, technically good and decent in the air.

West Ham are in talks over a deal for Rennes defender Jean-Armel Kana-Biyik. 

The 25-year-old was an option for them at the start of the window and after a proposed move to Palermo stalled they have been given the chance to sign him again. 

The tough-tackling defender started his career in the youth ranks at Le Havre and retired from playing for Cameroon after being left out of their final World Cup squad. He has one year to run on his contract with Rennes and is available for around £1.25m.

West Ham have finally sent Mali striker Modibo Maiga out on loan to FC Metz. The French Ligue 1 club have an option to buy the 26-year-old, who joined the Hammers from Sochaux in summer 2012, at the end of the campaign.

Lazio will have to sell another non-EU player before they can attempt to push through a deal for Stoke City's Geoff Cameron.

That could open the door for Sunderland who recognise that the USA international defender is frustrated at being left out of Stoke's starting line-up.

Cameron has not asked for a transfer from the Britannia Stadium but is looking to play regularly after turning 29 in July and reaching the peak time of his career.

The 6ft 3ins defender is a popular figure at Stoke among the squad but believes he may have to move on to get the game time he craves.

Sunderland are keen to take him as he can play in a number of positions while Southampton, Leicester and Hull have also enquired. Lazio are also keen but red tape has ensured that is now unlikely with the window closing at the weekend in Italy.

Out of favour: Several Premier League clubs, and Lazio, are monitoring Geoff Cameron's situation at Stoke

Former Tottenham and Manchester City defender Vedran Corluka is another target for Sunderland.

The 28-year-old is playing for Lokomotiv Moscow but is keen on a return to the Premier League and the Russian club are happy to sell for around £4.8million. 

Corluka can play at centre-back and full-back and has over 75 caps for Croatia. His experience of the Premier League also makes him a safer option in many manager's eyes and Gus Poyet is keen to discuss a potential deal. 

Sunderland are also waiting on developments with Salomon Kalou after he was left out of Lille's Champions League squad to face Porto.

QPR are in talks with Gremio over a deal for young Brazilian centre-back Bressan.

The 21-year-old only made his top flight bow in May 2013 but his agent has revealed a move to Loftus Road 'will probably happen'.

'A proposal was made [by QPR] that matches what we expected. But we are still waiting the club to make an official offer,' Bressan's agent Marcelo Lipatin told Globo Esporte.

'But the way things are going, [the transfer] will probably happen, all parties have reached an agreement.'

Earlier this year, a group led by Giuliano Bertolucci and Kia Joorabchian purchased 50 per cent of Bressan’s economic rights. Gremio retained 20percent, while the other 30percent is split between Bressan, his representatives and other investors.

Norwich have made enquiries for former Leeds United target Frederik Sorensen from Juventus.

Leeds had negotiated a fee with Juventus to take Sorensen to Elland Road on a season-long loan deal, but saw the agreement collapse when the player flew to England to seal the move. 

Verona, Genoa and Olympiacos are also interested in a loan but Norwich City have registered their interest in buying him outright.

Leeds, meanwhile, have made another enquiry to Cagliari this time over midfielder Daniele Dessena, 27.

Burnley are looking to revive a bid for Derby County defender Richard Keogh. 

The experienced 28-year-old was a target for Sean Dyche earlier in the summer along with teammate Craig Bryson. 

Burnley want extra bodies in before Monday and hope that Keogh will fit into their budget and the profile Dyche wants to blend in with his tight-knit team group. 

Dyche also has an interest in Bolton midfielder Mark Davies as competition heats up for his other target James McArthur of Wigan.

Marseille have made a fresh approach for Newcastle United defender Mapou Yanga-Mwiba. The French side want the centre-back on a season loan with view to a permanent deal. 

Coach Marcelo Bielsa is also in talks with Barcelona over a deal for former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song. Marseille have a little extra cash to play with after claiming £1m as a sell-on clause from Mehdi Benatia's £27m move from Roma to Bayern Munich.

Newcastle are battling it out with Fiorentina to sign Rayo Vallecano's Guinea international right winger Lass Bangoura, according to reports in Spain. 

The 22-year-old was left out of his club's La Liga opener against Atletico Madrid on Monday night.

Blackburn have signed teenage goalkeeper Ryan Crump. The 18-year-old, who played for Scotland U17s, has signed a one-year deal at Ewood Park after leaving Liverpool.
