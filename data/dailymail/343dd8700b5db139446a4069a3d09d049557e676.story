Shocking pictures of emaciated kangaroos starving to death show the devastating effects of drought in outback Australia.

Cattle farmer Tracey Walker - who lives on a property near Ilfracombe in Central West Queensland, which has been in drought for three years - says the kangaroo population has been hit hard by the crisis in the past two months.

'The kangaroos are really struggling, there's just not one bit of green pick,' Mrs Walker told Daily Mail Australia.

'They're just literally starving to death - it's a mighty cruel death.

Mrs Walker says kangaroos have been hit hard by Queensland's drought crisis in the past two months

She lives on a property near Ilfracombe, Queensland, which has been in drought for three years. In photos taken this week, she has captured dead and dying kangaroos around her 30,000 acre property

'You can see where they're digging the roots of the grass to try to find something but it's completely dead. It's just like matchsticks or cardboard, there's no nutrition.'

The drought conditions are so bad Mrs Walker was forced to remove all 800 of her cattle off her land 30,000 acre property three months ago.

'This is my second year of not having a proper wet season, I don't expect to see anything substantial growing until January next year - and that's if we get a wet,' she said.

She said many of the dams on her property have dried up, and kangaroos get bogged in them.

'The stronger ones have moved on, it's the weak that have been left here. They're the ones that are dying.'

Mrs Walker added that the Landsborough Highway, which stretches for 27km from Longreach to Ilfracombe, is covered by kangaroos that have starved to death.

'They call it the Killing Fields because it's just dead kangaroos on the side of the road that have been hit by cars and trucks,' she said.

'Now they are dying just of starvation, they're not even being hit by cars.'

Longreach Regional Council chief Mark Watt said local council workers are increasingly removing bodies of kangaroos that have starved to death from the sides of roads and the outskirts of townships.

'As the drought begins to take hold and as the grass and the herbage reduces the outcomes get quite intense, and more roos are tending to die,' Mr Watt told Daily Mail Australia.

'We can have roos coming into the main town area looking for water, feed or green grass in people's yards.

'They're just poor, innocent animals that haven't got many options.

'It's not surprising that they're just dying from lack of feed and lack of water from the prevailing drought conditions but you just can't do anything about it.'

Earlier this month, Longreach Mayor Joe Owens warned that Ilfracombe's water supply may run out within months.

The drought has had a devastating effect on the town with farmers forced to destock, families forced to relocated and local businesses struggling to make money.

Earlier this month, almost 80 percent of Queensland was officially declared to be in drought.

The Bureau of Meteorology said areas of western Queensland are suffering serious to severe rainfall deficiencies – meaning they are recording the lowest 10 percent to 5 percent of records. 

Mrs Walker said she has been trying to regenerate grass on her property, but kangaroos jump into the paddocks and eat any new greenery
