One of the country's oldest cricket clubs could go out of business because of a costly legal dispute with the director of a prestigious drama school - over a tiny patch of land.

Charlton Kings Cricket Club, which was founded in 1885, has been locked in a lengthy High Court battle with widow Jacki Mitchell, 63, who claims that the patch of land - just 1,618 square metres in size - at the club belonged to her late husband Henry Arthur Mitchell.

But the club, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, claims that it has been using the patch as an outfield area for more than a century.

Long history: The club has been playing at the ground in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire since its formation in 1885

Tiny: The patch of land which the cricket club and Mrs Mitchell are fighting over represents a fifth of the total land of the club

US-born Mrs Mitchell, a director of the Millennium Performing Arts school in Woolwich, London, staked a claim for the land - which represents a fifth of the Ryeworth Fields site - following the death of her husband.  

The area of land is just 0.4 acres or 1,618 square metres in size. To put that into context, the size of the field at Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia - one of the world's most famous cricket venues - is around 20,000 square metres.

The club has already shelled out £80,000 contesting the land and trustees say that it could go out of business if the judge rules against them.

The 18-month wrangle almost ended at the High Court in Birmingham on Friday after a four day trial, but a last minute legal point meant that judge Mr Justice Morgan was unable to bring the case to a fair conclusion.

The trial will now be halted for two months while legal teams look into an apparent tenancy agreement between the club and the land owners drawn up in 1947.

He told the court: 'It is a distinct change at the last moment. It would be unfair to proceed.

'I’m quite sure that if I take a decision today I’m going to produce a result that is not in accordance with the correct legal position.

'I think both of you are very vulnerable to the wrong answer emerging.

At risk: Trustees of the cricket club say that it could be forced out of business if it loses the High Court case

'Both would be better off if the point was explored directly with each side able to put forward a fully-considered final position with any evidence.'

The judge added that he regretted the delay but had no choice but to put the case back.

He added: 'It is very untidy and I’m not saying anything about how this has come about but we have got to the point where I’m going to adjourn the matter part heard with the expectation being that the matter will be the subject of a further one to two day hearing.'

Speaking after Friday’s hearing, the club’s cricket development officer Geoff White expressed his frustration at the delay.

He said: 'It’s an incredibly frustrating situation for everybody, we are very disappointed.

Hold up: The battle over the patch of land has been delayed after an old agreement between the owner and the club came to light

'We will do everything we can to ensure that cricket continues to be played on the ground, which has hosted matches for more than 100 years.'

Last year the club’s under 11s won the county cup and its under 15s were runners up in the same competition.

They are staging several events to raise funds for their spiraling legal costs, including a race day at the Cheltenham Festival on March 13.

Mrs Mitchell's Millennium Performing Arts school boasts an alumni including Eastenders actress Meryl Fernandes, who played Afia Masood in the soap between 2010 and 2012 and Boyzone singer Ronan Keating's ex-wife, model Yvonne.

Veteran actor Sir Derek Jacobi is a patron of the school.
