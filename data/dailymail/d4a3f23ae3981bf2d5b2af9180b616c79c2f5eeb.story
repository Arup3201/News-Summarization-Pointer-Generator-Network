Sam Allardyce has escaped the West Ham axe after agreeing to produce a more adventurous team true to the attacking principles of the club.

Under-pressure Allardyce was summoned to a meeting with the board yesterday and emerged with his job after accepting certain objectives, including a change of philosophy and a top-10 finish.

The 59-year-old will have a budget of £20million for signings — although the board will become more actively involved in the scouting and recruitment process.

Staying put: Many had expected Allardyce to be sacked after a disappointing season

Stand by your man: West Ham owners David Gold (left) and David Sullivan (right) met with Sam Allardyce on Tuesday along with vice-chairman Karren Brady (centre)

He has agreed to add to his staff an 
‘attacking coach’, someone who will have responsibilities for creating a
 more cavalier and entertaining side, and will also be expected to 
develop more youngsters from the West Ham academy.

Despite
 fierce opposition from supporters, joint-chairmen David Sullivan and 
David Gold have stayed loyal to Allardyce, who they appointed three  
years ago and who has a year left on his contract.

In
 a poll of more than 12,000 West Ham fans this month, less than a 
quarter said they  wanted to keep the manager who led them back to the 
Barclays Premier League in his first season and has kept the club up 
ever since, finishing 13th last season.

There were protests at Upton Park last season against the direct style of play and Allardyce was even booed in victory.

In
 a statement, the  co-owners stressed they had not ignored the feelings 
of supporters. ‘We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham 
United to operate under our joint  ownership,’ said Sullivan and Gold. 
‘Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we 
respect it as we have been supporters all our lives.

‘We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club.

‘Sam
 was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next  
season and during this he assured us he can deliver that ethos to West 
Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he 
needs.

‘We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season.

‘We
 should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made,
 Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing  
promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes 
in the two years thereafter.’

Shining light: Mark Noble was one of few players to emerge from the season with his head held high

Allardyce
 was also applauded in the statement for his work with Mark Noble, James
 Tomkins and Winston Reid and the team’s defensive solidity.

It is his expertise at avoiding  relegation which is his greatest asset to the club.

Allardyce’s
 record is so good that his presence virtually guarantees  survival. At 
least it does if he is allowed to play his way.

Whether his teams can be equally resilient while playing more expansive and attractive football remains to  be seen.

A
 similar clash of ideologies was at the heart of Stoke’s decision to 
part company with Tony Pulis. Stoke  finished ninth, but Pulis won LMA 
Manager of the Year for rescuing  Crystal Palace from the drop.

Sullivan
 and Gold have clearly wavered over this decision and put out feelers on
 potential successors but the decisive factor seems to have been that 
they were unsure about securing a more reliable option than Allardyce at
 this moment.

West Ham United can confirm that manager Sam Allardyce will lead the club into the 2014-15 Barclays Premier League season after constructive talks with the club's board.

The board and Allardyce have held lengthy and detailed discussions on the club's direction, values and philosophy and a positive way forward for next season has been agreed.

After listening to feedback from supporters, the board have insisted on improvements to the set-up of the playing and backroom staff to ensure the team provides more entertainment next season.

The manager has agreed to recruit a new attacking coach to complement the existing coaching set-up as well as an overhaul of the club's scouting and recruitment operation that will see the board have a greater involvement in the players who are signed, as the board will once again be investing considerable funds into the club this summer.

The club have made clear that they want to see progression on the pitch and at least a top-10 finish as a result.

West Ham United joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: 'We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham United to operate under our joint ownership. Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives. We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club.

'Sam was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us that he can deliver that ethos to West Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs. We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season.

'We should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made, Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes in the two years thereafter. 'We have also seen the likes of Mark Noble, James Tomkins and Winston Reid all make huge progress under his management, which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season.

'The truly historic opportunity of a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016 forms a major part of our five-year strategy to take this club forward and, while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the Premier League, we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world-renowned stadium.

'We are absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we want to see the Club continue on an upward trajectory next season. The 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a success.'

West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce said: 'I look forward to taking the club forward and improving the squad for next season to try and achieve the plans we have set out in our very productive meeting last week.'

West Ham leave
 Upton Park for the Olympic Stadium in 2016 and it is  central to the 
strategy to have the club in the Premier League.

‘We
 also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team 
playing in such a world-renowned stadium,’ added the co-owners. ‘We are 
absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we 
want to see the club continue on an upward trajectory next season.

‘The
 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam
 has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a 
success.’

For Allardyce, it
 is a muted victory. He remains at the helm, with his existing backroom 
team intact — even if he has been chastened and his powers reduced — and
 has the opportunity  to prove what he believes: that his methods are 
adaptable and capable of producing attractive football at an elite 
level.

‘I look forward to 
taking the club  forward and improving the squad for next season to try 
to achieve the plans set out in our very productive meeting last week,’ 
said the West Ham manager.
