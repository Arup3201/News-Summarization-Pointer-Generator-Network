An Indian couple could face child abuse charges after video emerged of a screaming 11-month-old baby being forced into a solo paraglider.

The shocking images were filmed in Kerala in southern India as the terrified infant was strapped in alone and sent up 50ft above a beach.

Horrified spectators watched on as the tiny girl, named as Niya Nazam, was harnessed in before the paraglider is dragged along the beach behind a truck and hoisted in to the sky.

When she touched down the screaming youngster was whisked out of her seat and rushed away from the scene, but did not appear to be physically harmed during the ordeal.

The Indian Express reports that police have now registered a case against the parents under the Juvenile Justice Act following the bizarre incident at Muzhipillangad beach.

Statements are already said to have been taken from the parents and organisers.

The website also reports that the child’s mother had 60 hours of flying experience and wanted the youngster to eventually follow in her footsteps.

According the Times of India, the event 
was organised by an adventure sports and tourism group which said the 
stunt was aimed at increasing the popularity of paragliding.

But the baby’s ordeal has sparked outrage in Kerala where the state’s Human Rights Commission is said to have registered a case against the parents and organisers.
