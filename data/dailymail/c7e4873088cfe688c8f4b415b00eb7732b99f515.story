Career civil servant: Sharon White, 47, is the first woman and first black person to be appointed the chief executive of broadcasting regulator Ofcom

A career civil servant who once worked in the No 10 policy unit under Tony Blair has been appointed as the new chief executive of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom.

Sharon White, 47, a senior official in the Treasury, is the first woman and the first person from an ethnic minority to lead Ofcom. 

She will step into the role in March to replace Ed Richards, himself a former Blair adviser.

While Mr Richards earned a salary of £284,362 and had full remuneration of £393,000, Miss White will receive a lower basic salary of £275,000. Ofcom was unable to release details of her full package.

Miss White has worked in the public sector for more than two decades under both Labour and Conservative administrations.

Her career has included stints in Washington, the World Bank and the Departments of Work and Pensions, International Development and Justice. 

The economics graduate is currently Second Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. 

Married to Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Miss White was approved for the position by the Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. 

Ofcom’s remit stretches from broadcasting to telecommunications to the postal service and, when Miss White takes over, key tasks will include the auction process for Premier League broadcasting rights and a market-impact assessment into the proposed closure of BBC3.

An Ofcom spokesperson said: ‘Sharon worked under the Conservative, Labour and Coalition governments as an official. 

'None of her appointments were political; she worked as a civil servant throughout. 

'The Board of Ofcom identified no conflicts of interest with the appointment of Sharon as Chief Executive, which was approved by the Secretary of State.’
