A baby tortoise handles his first bean sprout like a professional as he eats the whole thing - even though it's almost the length of him.

Terry the tortoise drags himself along the ground as he chomps down the sprout, getting closer to the end each time.

With determination and a little help from someone holding the sprout, Terry almost finishes before the video ends.

The 14-month-old Horsefield Tortoise 'loves nothing more than tormenting the cat' owner Toni Allen told The Huffington Post.

Allen added that Terry would eat 'just about anything' and has a particular love of coriander. 

Judging Terry's enthusiastic way of eating, it can only be assumed that he has a new-found love for bean sprouts, too.
