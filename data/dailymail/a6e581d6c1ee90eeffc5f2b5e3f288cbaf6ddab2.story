Mum was definitely not the word when it came to this new arrival.

New father Aidan McManus live tweeted the birth of his son Finn all over the internet, while clutching wife Tracy's hand in one hand and his iPhone in the other.

The project manager documented before, during and after the Caesarian delivery, posting Instagram photos to his Twitter account as it happened.

'From taking each photo, applying a filter, writing the caption and tweeting it probably took about 20 seconds so I was able to get them straight out there for people to see,' explains Mr McManus.

The couple, who live in Crosby, Merseyside, had baby Finn at Ormskirk General Hospital. They already have a four-year-old daughter Isobel and it was her birth, says 32-year-old Mr McManus, which first prompted his photography hobby.

'I realised there wasn't a lot of decent quality photos of the big occasion then, so this time round I did see it as part of my role to capture the event.

'We didn't really discuss it beforehand, but I am a huge Twitter user and I got the idea because I know a couple of people who have tweeted their weddings; the groom has been standing at the altar tweeting away discreetly, although I don't know anyone who's done it for a birth before.'

Booked in for an elective Caesarian, Mr McManus first started taking iPhone snaps while he and his wife were waiting to go to the delivery suite.

'Because we were a non-emergency procedure, there was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up,' he smiles.

'I had my phone with me and also my proper camera so I was taking better quality photos with that, but I didn't have the ability to share those instantly. They went onto a memory card to be uploaded when we got home.

'But the beauty of Instagram, which is a photo sharing site, is you have a Twitter option built in so it was easy to just snap away and then tweet the links.'

Given that she was busy with the job of giving birth, Mr McManus says his wife left it to his discretion about what images were taken and what were shared with his hundreds of followers.

Mr McManus said: 'There was a few hours of hanging around and all the anticipation and the nerves were building up'

Mr McManus started tweeting at 9am and carried on until 11.30am, after the baby was born

'She didn't give me any rules or dos and don'ts, but in the end there were a lot more graphic photos I wasn't willing share,' he laughs.

Mr McManus says he was careful to ensure that the actual arrival, and most importantly the mother-to-be, weren't forgotten in his eagerness to capture the event.

'I made sure Tracy never felt neglected, of course,' he adds, 'although since I've become a keen amateur photographer she's quite used to having a camera pointed at her now.'

Over the 30 hours the couple and Isobel were in hospital, Mr McManus posted eight photos from when they arrived until they left with Finn all tucked up in his little hat and gloves.

Now the family and their friends will always have the unique montage to look back on and remember.

So, does Mr McManus intend to whip out his iPhone for another special occasion?

'We're not planning any more children but I'd definitely do it again,' he laughs. 'Maybe for the christening...'
