It's all about Paul Pogba on the front page of French newspaper L'Equipe, who opt to use a range of pictures to depict the midfielder's performance against Spain on Thursday.

The France star played the full 90 minutes against his Spanish counterparts as Chelsea striker Loic Remy scored the game's only goal 17 minutes from time.

'Pogbamania' is the word L'Equipe coin to describe the 21-year-old, once of Manchester United.

In Spain, though, it's all about Real Madrid. Marca label the 'diamond-studded Madrid' as the 'leader in income' after they raked in 603.9million euros.

The Spanish newspaper describe the La Liga giants as a model club that know how to manage their finances, and Real president Florentino Perez says 'Madrid is a case they study at Harvard'.

Perez has, however, had to play down rumours of a feud with Cristiano Ronaldo after the former Manchester United star criticised the club's transfer policy.

'There are no problems with Cristiano, he has not questioned the club,' says Perez.

Fellow Spanish newspaper AS reiterate Perez's comments, saying the Real president insists 'Cristiano did not question the politics of the club' and that there are 'zero discrepancies'.

Perez has cleared the air about Angel di Maria's £60m departure to Manchester United and Xabi Alonso's £5m move to Bayern Munich.

Not only that, Perez says 'we looked at signing Falcao' but, quite clearly, Real opted out.

Mundo Deportivo report Munir El Haddadi is 'into the national team' and that Spain manager Vicente del Bosque has called up 'the pearl of Barcelona to replace the injured (Diego) Costa'.

The striker says: 'When they told me, I was left open-mouthed.'

Not to be outdone, Lionel Messi remains in the headlines. The Spanish newspaper say the Barcelona star is 'like a motorbike', scoring three goals in a practice match in a training session.

Likewise to Mundo Deportivo, their Spanish newspaper rivals Sport discuss Munir.

The 19-year-old is taking charge of the media in Spain as he looks to replace Costa, who is sidelined by a hamstring injury.

Italian newspapers share the same sentiment in that Simeone Zaza is a 'hitman who cannot be lost'.

Tuttosport say he is 'worthy of Juve' while La Gazzetta dello Sport say him and Ciro Immobile are the 'attack of the future'.

The duo are reportedly 'made for each other' and gave a glimpse of that during the 2-0 win over Holland.
