These new computer-generated images put into context the huge scale of the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) has released a series of powerful posters illustrating the sheer size of the warships.

The computer-generated images show the warships dwarfing some of the country's most recognisable landmarks.

Another notable poster is of the under-construction HMS Queen Elizabeth berthed alongside in Portsmouth, Hants.

The ACA is a consortium of defence companies behind the construction of Portsmouth's newest carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales.

Ian Booth, programme director of the ACA, said: 'These posters depict the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers in front of the Houses of Parliament and in Portsmouth.

'They're stunning images and show that two really spectacular ships can be expected once construction is complete.'

A computer-generated image released last year showed how HMS Queen Elizabeth would look alongside at Portsmouth Naval Base.

The images reveal the length of the ship is the equivalent of 28 London buses and is almost three times the size of Buckingham Palace.

Around 80,000 tonnes of steel will be used for the two ships, three times that used in Wembley Stadium

The carriers are 280m in length, 65,000 tonnes and capable of transporting 40 aircraft - twice the capacity of HMS Illustrious.

They are being constructed at shipyards around the country and taken for assembly at Rosyth in Scotland.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance is formed of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence.

Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said: 'This is superb and great news - it's going to benefit the city and the country on many different levels.

'I can't wait to see the work being completed and then seeing these ships in Portsmouth.'
