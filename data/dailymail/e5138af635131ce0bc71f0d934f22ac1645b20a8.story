McDonald's is attempting to trademark the term 'McBrunch and filed the trademark application for McBrunch back in July.

It's unclear what the The Golden Arches actually plan to do with the trademark, however four years ago Burger King trialed a brunch menu in select markets, but ultimately scrapped the idea.

A McDonald's spokesperson confirmed the application but cautioned, 'We routinely file intent to use trademark applications as a regular course of business. We can't share details at this time as to how the trademarks may or may not be used.'

New ideas? The Golden Arches filed the trademark application for McBrunch back in July

The fast-food giant has toyed with the idea of brunch before. McDonald's applied for a trademark on 'McBrunch' in 2001 but abandoned that application

The idea for introducing a brunch menu would call in line with the trends of many other fast food franchises. 

Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Chick-Fil-A and Burger King have increased the number of breakfast options on their menu.

The fast-food giant has contemplated with the idea of brunch before. McDonald's applied for a trademark on 'McBrunch' in 2001 but abandoned that application.

However, pundits are suggesting the company may be more serious this time around due to flagging sales.

McDonald's saw same-store sales decline 2.8 percent in August, which was slightly worse than analysts' estimates of a 2 percent decline.

The fast-food giant reported its worst global monthly same-store sales in a decade.

The move comes as fast food franchises like Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King have been ramping up breakfast options

It continues to test more upscale breakfast items, like the recent mini bundt cakes and chorizo breakfast burritos.

The competition has been particularly fierce at breakfast time, which McDonald's relies on for about 25% of its sales.

McDonald's has been focusing on coffee in the past few years, as Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks have ramped up their food offerings.

Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum! Brands, has introduced new breakfast items, such as the Waffle Taco and the Biscuit Taco, with great fanfare.

McDonald's has also been losing ground to regional chains, such as Sonic and Jack in the Box, that appeal to younger consumers.

In the fast-food business, among the most common — and least expensive — ways to grow sales is to create new so-called 'day parts' to lure customers during times of the day that they don't usually stop by. 

That's why some chains have been pushing late-afternoon smoothies and late-night snacks.

A Brunch program at McDonald's would likely be limited to weekends and holidays and extend the breakfast hour to noon or even 1 p.m. as well as introduce new items not currently on the breakfast menu. 

McMozzarella sticks were intorudced last month. McDonald's have been branching out with new items in the hopes of attracting new customers over the past year-and-a-half

Last month, McDonald's added mozzarella sticks to its menu - with the obligatory 'McMarinara' sauce on the side.

The fast-food chain is test-running the snack in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with three pieces being sold for a dollar.

The menu item is not entirely new - the cheesy item was previously available in the UK and called Mozzarella Dippers.
