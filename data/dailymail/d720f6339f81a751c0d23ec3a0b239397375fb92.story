The grieving family of a music fan who was beaten to death in a random attack at a festival have made a heart-breaking appeal to find the man's killer.

Robert Hart, 26, suffered fatal head injuries after being attacked in front of his girlfriend at the Parklife Weekender Festival in Manchester.

It is believed Mr Hart was punched to the floor and knocked unconscious as he stepped in to protect Gemma Parry after she was hit in the back with an inflatable doll.

Heartbreak: Elaine Hart, the mother of a music fan who died in a random attack at Parklife Festival in Manchester made an emotional plea for her son's killer to come forward today

The attack took place as 67,000 people converged on Heaton Park to see R'n'B-turned reggae star Snoop Dogg aka Snoop Lion aka Snoopzilla perform live.

Two off-duty medical staff rushed to Mr Hart's aid and gave him CPR. He was rushed to hospital but died four days later after suffering a bleed to the brain.

Today his mother Elaine, 65, from Rainow, near Macclesfield, Cheshire, broke down as she made an appeal for the killer to come forward.

Mrs Hart, who was supported by her family and Miss Parry, 32, said: 'I have lost my son who I absolutely adored, as I do all of my children.

'He would come home and hug me and as he got older he got taller and taller and made me feel small. I just looked forward to him coming home so much.

'He would sometimes call me Elaine or mum but quite often he would still say mummy.

'He was the kindest, warmest, and 
funniest man and not aggressive and we all adored him. This person has 
took that all away from us. They know they have done it.'

Appeal: The music fan's family and his girlfriend Gemma, pictured centre, spoke at the appeal today. Mr Hart was attempting to protect Miss Parry, 32, when the attack took place

Comfort: Sisters Rachel North and Nicola Hart embrace following the emotional appeal. Mr Hart was taken to hospital following the attack - but died four days later from his injuries

Mrs Hart later read a Mother’s Day card the victim had written to her last March.

He wrote: 'To mummy. Wishing you all the love in the world on Mother’s Day.

'Thanks for always being there and being an endless source of advice and love and for being a fantastic chef. Lots of love, Robert.'

Keen guitarist and Manchester City fan Mr Hart, originally from Macclesfield, lived in Liverpool with his girlfriend after attending university in the city.

Emotional: Mrs Hart, centre with daughter Rachel and son Richard, breaks down as she speaks this afternoon. She said: 'He was the kindest, warmest, and funniest man and not aggressive and we all adored him'

'Adored': The victim's sister Nicola struggles to contain her emotions as her mother spoke to press today. Mrs Hart read from a mother's day card her son sent her last year which read: 'Thanks for always being there'

The pair were said to be planning to start a family together.

Mr Hart’s brother Richard said: 'A music festival is supposed to be about fun and laughter and memories to share. It’s not a place for any act of violence like this. Bobby was a brilliant brother and one cowardly act has took him away from all of our family and friends.

'Bobby would ring any member of my family whether it was raining or snowing and he would say "what a brilliant day to be alive".

'One person’s actions have changed that. Those words will now never be spoken.

'There was one word that every single one of us - friends and family - used: awesome.

'He was just awesome to be around and to spend time with. We have all been robbed of his life. Nothing will be the same.

'When you have to tell an 8-year-old boy who Bobby doted on - my son - that you can’t see him anymore it is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.

'He was a people person. He has had a massive influence on everybody’s life.

'I will turn my son into him because that’s what Bobby would have pushed for.'

Miss Parry said: 'He would always try to protect me. He was so looking forward to the festival and excited, he couldn’t wait.'

The incident occurred on Saturday June 7 after Mr Hart travelled to Manchester for the festival - which was attended by a total of 120,000 people over the two days.

He and his girlfriend were waiting for Snoop to come on stage at 9.15pm when the blow up doll was thrown into the crowd and it struck Gemma in the back.

A barman said: 'The inflatable toy was full of mud and Robert turned with a bit of a scowl but he then put his hand up to say he did not want trouble. The other guy punched him once and he fell to the floor and I heard a thud.

'It was horrible. His girlfriend was screaming and people were waving for help.

'Some of the crowd helped him and gave him chest compressions and then security turned up. When they picked him up you could see he was all over the place and his eyes were not right.

'I just knew it was something serious but never thought it would be this bad.'

Mr Hart was initially taken to a medical tent by security officers being being rushed to North Manchester General Hospital.

His condition deteriorated and he was later transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford where he died on Wednesday June 11.

DI Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Our immediate thoughts go out to Robert’s family and loved ones. We currently have specially trained officers with them to help through this terrible time.

'We believe a confrontation took place following an inflatable doll hitting Robert’s girlfriend.

'We are aware other assaults took place in the park that evening, but I am specifically appealing for witnesses who recall seeing the inflatable doll and the attack on Robert immediately thereafter.

'I am keen for those witnesses to come forward and other persons nearby who may have mobile phone footage of the attack or captured an image of the person responsible.

'Finally, if you are the man responsible or were with him that evening, please come forward.'

Police said the attacker is described as mixed race, aged in his late 20s and around 6ft 1 tall was muscular with short, dark hair shaved at the sides. He was also wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with the letter ‘A’ in white on the front.

A spokesman for Parklife said: 'We pride ourselves on a history of Parklife Weekender without any incidents.

'We regret that an isolated incident has taken place at this year’s event. However, medics were on the scene within minutes of it taking place. We urge festival-goers to help the police identify the individual involved and contact them if they have any information at all.'
