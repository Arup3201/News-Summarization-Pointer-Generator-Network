Mob wife¿ star Alicia DiMichele has quit the television show

‘Mob wife’ star Alicia DiMichele has quit the television show to focus on fighting embezzlement charges after withdrawing her earlier guilty plea.

The 40-year-old submitted a resignation letter to the VH1 cable channel three weeks ago, sources said.

The wife of reputed Colombo enforcer Edward (Tall Guy) Garofalo, Jr., appeared at Brooklyn Federal Court Wednesday where she withdrew her guilty plea to helping him embezzle $40,000 in Teamsters pension funds from a Staten Island trucking company.

He was handed a seven-year jail term earlier this year for murder conspiracy and witness tampering. 

DiMichele was earning $8,000 per episode from the show which she joined last year. - this prompted prosecutors to argue that she was able to pay a $96,000 fine, reported the New York Daily News.

Federal Judge Sandra Townes is now looking at the amount of restitution DiMichele owes to Teamsters Local 282.

DiMichele’s lawyer and the government had agreed the figure is $20,000, but the general counsel for the union’s benefits fund put the amount at $2.8 million including 18 per cent interest.

Townes said she could not accept the lower figure and offered DiMichele the opportunity to take back her guilty plea.

'I’m relieved and as always I’m staying positive,' DiMichele told The News.

Alicia DiMichele, seen right leaving court last year, had previously admitted she helped her husband, Edward 'Tall Guy' Garofalo Jr, (left) to scam tens of thousands of dollars in union-pension funds while working for an alleged mob-tied construction firm

'We expect there will be a new plea that satisfies the government and the defense without having her potentially liable for $2 million in restitution,' said defense lawyer John Wallenstein.

Under the plea deal, she faced up to six months in prison.

The mother-of-three told the court in 2012 she 'agreed with my husband' to participate in the scheme.

Evidence against her includes recordings from two wiretaps and testimony of two witnesses.

DiMichele’s husband pleaded guilty to a murder conspiracy, but not the embezzling charge so the restitution is now focused on DiMichele.

He had agreed to testify during Wednesday’s hearing but prison officials couldn’t get him to Brooklyn from his out of state lockup. 

DiMichele made no mention of the case or her decision to leave the show on her Twitter page today.

Instead, she wrote: 'The more you do this the happier you will be.'
