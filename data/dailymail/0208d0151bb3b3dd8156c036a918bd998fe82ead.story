New Rangers boss Stuart McCall admits he would never have landed the job if Mike Ashley was still pulling the strings at Ibrox.

The former Motherwell manager has been put in charge until the end of the season.

The decision to replace caretaker Kenny McDowall, who has now left the club, is the second major upheaval at the club in the space of a week following Dave King's boardroom coup last Friday.

Stuart McCall has been named Rangers manager until the end of the season

McCall, like the club's new board, is a man the Light Blues faithful can trust following his trophy-laden stint as Rangers player during the mid-90s.

But the 50-year-old does not believe the former regime, backed by Newcastle United owner Ashley's millions, would have welcomed him through the front door on Edmiston Drive so readily.

He said: 'I don't think I'd have been offered the job if the new regime hadn't come in.

'I had a chat with John Gilligan yesterday and Paul Murray late last night. It was a whirlwind.

'I'm delighted for the people in charge of the club because I know how much it means to them. I'm delighted for the supporters because that is what they want.

McCall will attempt to guide Rangers to promotion from the Championship to the Scottish Premiership

'That's not to say the people on the board are going to be great successes. But whatever they do, it will be for the good of the club.'

McCall hopes he can lead the club to promotion and claim the job on a permanent basis.

But he acknowledges the task will be a tough one.

The former nine-in-a-row midfielder - who will give up his coaching duties with Scotland while in charge at Ibrox - said: 'My first question was: What do they deem a success?

'You could turn things around slightly, get to the play-off final, get your goalie sent-off after five minutes and then lose on penalty kicks. These are the thin lines between success and failure.

'I think success would be if we could start putting results together, getting belief in everyone, smiles on faces and turn things around.'
