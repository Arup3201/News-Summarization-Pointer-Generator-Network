Scientists testing the lasers on Nasa rover Curiosity have discovered startling similarities to a matter found on Earth.

Researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the Red Planet, but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on Earth.

The make-up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like Hawaii and St. Helena, as well as in continental rift zones like the Rio Grande, which extends from Colorado to Chihuahua, Mexico.

More than meets the eye: The rock as more like the unusual types found on oceanic islands such a Hawaii and St Helena

Referring to rock formed from molten material, Curiosity scientist Ralf Gellert, from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It was a bit of a surprise, what we found with this rock.

'It's igneous. But it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on Mars.'

Curiosity arrived on Mars two months ago to learn if the most Earth-like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life.

Last month, Curiosity's laser was used to zap the football-sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised material, as well as tiny pits left behind, to determine its chemical composition.

Scientists found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock examined by previous Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.

The rock, named after a Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory rover engineer, Jake Matijevic, who died shortly 
after Curiosity's landing, was also rich in feldspar-like minerals, 
which provided clues about the rock's history.

Nasa named the rock after the late 
engineer Jacob Matijevic, who was the surface operations systems chief 
engineer for Mars Science Laboratory and the project's Curiosity rover.

He passed away on August 20, at age
64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous NASA Mars rovers:
Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity.

Geologist Edward Stolper, from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, compared the make-up of the rock to 
how hard apple cider was partially frozen in big 
barrels during the winter in colonial times.

He said: 'The way in which this type 
of rock forms ... is like how applejack liquor was made. You'd 
crystallise out ice and you'd make more and more and more concentrated 
apple-flavored liquor.'

Magma inside a planet can undergo a similar process, he added, saying it takes very particular conditions on Earth to produce this type of magma.

Stolper said: 'You melt the interior 
and it comes to the surface and, just like the applejack, when you cool 
it, it crystallizes.'

Meanwhile, the rover has moved on to 
testing and cleaning of its soil scoop. Eventually, scientists want to 
funnel soil samples to Curiosity's onboard laboratory for more extensive
chemical analysis.

The rover is part way to its first 
science target, an area known as Glenelg, which has three different 
types of rock intersecting.

The
car-sized Curiosity rover landed inside a giant impact basin called 
Gale Crater, located near the Martian equator, for a two-year, $2.5 
billion astrobiology mission, NASA's first since the 1970s-era Viking 
probes.
