A husband who shot his terminally ill wife before turning the gun on himself left a tape recorded message saying 'I can’t live without her', an inquest heard.

Father-of-three Peter Seager, 69, and his 62-year-old wife Daphne Seager, were both found dead at home by their children with wounds to the head, a hearing into their deaths was told.

In a dictaphone recording played to the inquest, retired gas fitter Mr Seager said: 'We were always meant to be together and always be one.

Found dead: Peter and Daphne Seager were found at their home on this street in Dagenham, Essex, by their grown children, who had been left messages explaining their actions, an inquest heard

'But life hasn't dictated that for us and we’re faced with being left alone and we don’t want to be alone.

'No pain, no problems, no nothing. Please don’t think down on me, that I took your mum away from you. It’s our choice, it’s what we want. Please forgive us for what we are going to do.'

Police discovered two guns next to the couple. 

Mr Seager left the message for his family after killing his wife, a retired dinner lady, on the day she was due to return to a hospice.

After Mr Seager finished speaking his wife also left a message, in a weak and barely audible voice.

She said: 'I'm sorry for what I'm going to do. I love you, I love you lots. Bye.'

Mrs Seager, of Dagenham, Essex, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011.

But just months before her death in June 2013 shed was told it had spread to her brain.

Because she was left weak and bed-ridden she stayed at St Francis Hospice in Romford from April 21 before returning home two months later.

Walthamstow Coroner’s Court heard Mr and Mrs Seager lived at home with their two sons, Derrick and Nicholas.

Nicholas found a note alongside the dictaphone in the early hours of June 4 in his room, which told him not to go downstairs.

In a statement read to the court Derrick Seager, who discovered his parents’ bodies, said: 'Around 3:45am Nicholas found a note in his room and a box.

'It told him not to go downstairs and he came and told me. After my father had said "we will never be apart" it was running in my mind.'

Describing the moment he went downstairs, Mr Seager said: 'I saw the blood and thought dad has done something. I closed the door, because I didn’t want it to be the last image I saw of them.'

Mrs Seager’s daughter, Susan Stirman, said her mother had begged to be allowed to return to the hospice because she would be more comfortable there.

Ms Stirman told the court: 'She just said: "You’ve got to get me out of here, I’ve not had a bath in two weeks."'

When it had been arranged to take Mrs Seager back to the hospice, Mrs Stirman went to visit her mother at home to tell her the news.

She said: 'When I left, she just thanked me for arranging to move her into the hospice.

'She just touched my arm and said that she loved me. She then sort of put her thumbs up and said: "See you in the morning."'

Asked what her mother’s state of mind was on the day, Mrs Stirman said: 'I would say she was happy.'

When asked what her father's reaction to his wife moving back into the hospice was, she said: 'I didn't talk to him at all.'

However, she did say that she heard him mention that they would 'never, ever be apart'.

She told the hearing: 'I always knew my dad would be lost without my mum, but I didn’t think he would go to the extremes of what happened.

'If my mum died first, I had thought he may have killed himself.'

She added: 'He was a bit like Jekyll and Hyde, you never knew what to expect, or whether he would be happy or not. He was a control freak.'

She described her mum as a real family person, adding: 'She was most happy when she had all her family around her.'

Eileen Tall, Mrs Seager's sister, told the court that she had received a phone call from Mr Seager just months before the couple’s deaths.

She said he told her: 'I can’t see her in pain and I will kill her to put her out of the pain.'

She added: 'Then he said that he shouldn't have told me that.'

She confirmed to Coroner Nadia Persaud that Mr Seager has said he would kill himself if anything happened to Daphne. 

Dr Vinnie Nambisan, a consultant at the hospice, said he did not believe Mrs Seager would be able to kill herself with the weapons.

The inquest continues.
