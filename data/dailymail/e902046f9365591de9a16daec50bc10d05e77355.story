The co-host of CNBC show Squawk Box has been criticized for making racist comments and impersonating an Indian accent on Friday's show.

During a discussion about foreign exchange rates, Joe Kernen ignored his co-hosts' pleas to stop as he mimicked an Indian accent and made an inappropriate joke.

Hosts on the show, which describes itself as bringing Wall Street to Main Street, had been talking about India's central bank when what had been light banter turned to embarrassing racial stereotypes.

Apology: Joe Kernen said sorry to viewers after mimicking an Indian accent on the show

After Becky Quick produced two rupee notes from her purse, which were left over from a trip abroad, the morning talk show hosts started to talk about how Gandhi's picture featured on one of the bills, Daily News reported.

As Quick and the others talked about the notes, Kernen could be heard in the background repeating 'Gandhi' in an Indian accent.

His co-hosts then looked alarmed as Kernen said: 'No, I can't do it. I was going to say something.'

Perhaps aware of what may happen next, Quick told him: 'Please don't'.

But the anchor, who used to work as an on-air stock editor, asked: 'I really can't,'

Joke: Despite the Squawk Host team telling him not to, Joe Kernen made a racist comment

Choosing to ignore the good advice of his colleagues, Kernen then blurted outÂ  'Are they good at 7-11'.

He was quickly condemned by his co-hosts, leading him to say: I'm sorry, I take it back. I apologize, before I have to.'

In a comment to Mail Online, Kernen said: 'Last Friday, I made an inappropriate and insensitive remark on Squawk Box. I apologize for any offense it caused.'
