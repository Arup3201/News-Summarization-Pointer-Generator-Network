Top talker: MSNBC host Chris Matthews has been selected as the commencement speaker for Ohio State University but many students feel slighted by the pick

Students at Ohio State University are outraged that MSNBC host Chris Matthews has been selected as their graduation speaker.

'The response from students is simply that we don’t know who this guy is, we don’t care about this guy,' student government president Taylor Stepp said.

Students at the state school have spoken out after the announcement last week that Matthews will speak at their commencement ceremonies in May.

Matthews has headlined a talk show since 1997- first Hardball With Chris Matthews which is now called The Chris Matthews Show.

The school lauded Matthews, 68, in their press release announcing his selection by praising his 'remarkable depth of experience and has distinguished himself as a broadcast journalist, newspaper bureau chief, presidential speechwriter, congressional staffer and best-selling author'.

The well-known Democrat has also written six books about politics, and even though the most recent book is about how bipartisanship thrived during the Reagan administration, some students have reportedly taken issue with his personal allegiances.

'The fact that Mr Matthews obviously has a very liberal leaning and he’s not even a public official was irksome to me,' Mr Stepp said to The Columbus Dispatch.

Democratic process: In the past, students were able to weigh in with suggestions for who the graduation speaker should be but the university took that privilege away this year allegedly on account of speed

Matthews would be far from the most 
prominent Democrat to speak to the students, as President Obama was 
their commencement speaker last year.

According
 to the school, former presidents Ford, Bush Sr, Bush Jr and Clinton 
have all spoken at earlier ceremonies, as well as Speaker of the House 
John Boehner- a native Ohioan.

Some of the backlash may be a result of the decision to change the selection process, taking the former input from students out of the equation.

In the past, suggestions were given to 
University officials after a search committee made up of school 
professors and select students compiled a list of suggestions.

This year, that search committee was disbanded.

'Because of time constraints and leadership changes during the past year, the decision was made to use a more streamlined approach to speaker selection for spring 2014 commencement,' university spokesman Gary Lewis told The Dispatch.

Matthew's current speaking fee is unknown, but ThinkProgress reported that in 2005 he earned approximately $35,000 from one event that year.
