A woman miraculously brought her pet lizard back to life in Oregon by administering CPR on the reptile for a good 30 minutes.

Sherrie Dolezal, 62, returned to her home in Salem on Tuesday to find her beloved pet Del Sol, a bearded dragon, floating face up and unconscious in his pool.

She immediately began chest compressions and forced air into his mouth until the little creature opened his eyes and started moving again.

The grandmother, who calls herself the Reptile Rescuer, keeps 22 lizards – including 3-year-old Del Sol - at her home.

She was having a crazy day Tuesday, running errands and caring for her pets when she took Del Sol out to clean and feed him and then put him back in a small swimming pool.

She put Del Sol in his pool on Tuesday but forgot to put rocks in so he could climb about. When she came back she found him floating face up.

‘When I came back I was sure he was dead, which just killed me because Del belongs to my great-grandson, Roberto,’ Dolezal told the Statesman Journal.

‘I really couldn’t remember how many chest compressions should be given before a rescue breath, but he was blue so I just did it. I was really amazed it worked.’

Working for what she said felt like a half hour, she held the motionless Del and rubbed his belly, then hung him upside down to clear water from his mouth and breathed air past his teeth.

Before long, he opened his eyes and started to move.

The cold-blooded, golden-hued reptile lives in Dolezal's northeast Salem home with 21 other lizards, most rescued, some bought, along with one Russian tortoise and three dogs.
