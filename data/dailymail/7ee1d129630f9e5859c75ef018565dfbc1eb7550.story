Meet Lilo the 'tigerador' who was given a make over especially for the fourth birthday of his owner's Winne-the-Pooh-mad niece.

Matt Curran decided to turn his 10-month-old labrador pup into the character of Tigger using animal-safe dye for his niece's birthday surprise.

It took 90 minutes to dye Lilo's coat at Mudgeeraba's Animal Magic Pet Grooming Salon, run by award-winning dog groomer Emily Myatt.

The pooch's coat was dyed orange on top, with black stripes on her back, limbs and around the eyes to resemble a tiger.

Mr Curran said the dye job was a complete success and that his niece likened Lilo to Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.

Mr Curran told Gold Coast: ‘My niece loves tigers, who doesn't like tigers? She loved it, she thought it was Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh.

‘People keep tagging me on Facebook asking if that's my dog. They stop and take photos and toot at her, most people love it.

‘Some people think it's cruel and that I've done it myself, but it's a professional job and safe. We're stuck with a tiger for next few months but it's pretty exciting.

'We're thinking a zebra or something next time. It's something different. She's cute when she's a labrador, but she's so much cuter as a tigerador.’

Staff at the salon said Lilo was well behaved during the dyeing session.

‘We only use the special dog dye on dogs
with no skin allergies and those that can handle sitting down for 
periods of time,’ stylist Lucy Taylor said.

‘Lilo loves the attention and we just kept giving her treats and breaks so she was fine.'
