Taxpayers will have to find another £12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners, a leading think tank has warned.

Workers face the prospect of paying more to sustain perks like the winter fuel allowance, more generous pensions and tax breaks on retirement pots.

Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned the rising bill of an ageing population comes at a time when 'pensioners as a group have stopped being poor'.

Britain will be spending £12billion more on benefits for pensioners in 2018-19 than in 2010-11, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies

David Cameron has repeatedly rejected calls to cut the benefits given to pensioners, including the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes.

The IFS also warns that spending on public sector pensions is set to top £36billio this year, life expectancy has risen much faster than the state pension age and tax breaks costing billions have 'benefitted pensioners at the expense of workers'.

In six years' time there will be two million more people aged over 65 than there were in 2010.

To deal with the increasing costs Mr Johnson said society has three choices - cutting benefits and services for older people, increasing taxes, or making cuts elsewhere.

Mr Johnson said the choice made by the current Government is 'pretty clear' in focusing cuts on people of working age.

Writing in The Times, he said: 'Cutting benefits for those over the state pension age is obviously difficult. People retire with a set of expectations about what the state will provide and may find it hard to adjust if that support is reduced. More prosaically, pensioners vote. 

'But in thinking about the shape of support for the older population it is important to be aware of one rather important fact.

Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, claimed pensioners as a group 'have stopped being poor'

'Pensioners as a group have stopped being poor. Or rather we have moved from a world only 30 years ago in which pensioners were much more likely to be poor than their younger counterparts to one in which they are less likely to be poor.'

While he hailed that fact as 'probably the greatest triumph of social policy during my lifetime', Mr Johnson warned of the costs associated with it.

He cited generous public sector pensions and also said 'plans to raise it (the state pension age) by a couple of years by the mid-2020s don't look so radical' when the 10-year rise in male life expectancy is considered.

'Despite increases in the state pension age for women, we are likely to be spending about £12billion more on benefits for pensioners in 2018-19 than in 2010-11,' he warned.

Research published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found pensioner poverty has fallen over the past decade, but showed there has been a big increase in the number of younger people living in poverty.

Pensioner poverty is now at the lowest level on record and the UK's employment rate is close to a historic high, but incomes are lower than 10 years ago, and average wages for full-time male workers have fallen by £1 an hour to £12.90.

The large-scale study carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008.

Instead, it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004.

Although the report does not attribute this to migration, the figure began to rise in the same year Tony Blair’s government opened the gates to allow migrants from Eastern European countries the right to work freely in Britain.

Since then the Eastern European population has shot up to around a million people, while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside Europe.

Many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower-skilled workers in the existing population for low-paid jobs.
