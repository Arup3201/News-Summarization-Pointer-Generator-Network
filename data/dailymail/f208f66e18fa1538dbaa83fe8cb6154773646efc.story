A large family has been killed after an artillery shell they kept in their home exploded.

Women and children were among the ten relatives blown up by the devastating blast in a remote tribal region in the country's north-west along the Afghan border.

Pakistani government official Tahir Khan said Monday's explosion was from a suspected artillery shell that stored in the house in the village of Dars in the Tirah Valley.

The valley is located in the Khyber tribal region.

The valley had been a hotbed for Islamic militants until the Pakistan army captured it last year in fierce fighting.

It
 is thought dead al Quaida terror chief Osama bin Laden evaded capture 
by U.S. special forces by fleeing Afghanistan through this valley in 
2001 along with 50 senior terrorists.

He
 slipped through the lawless and largely sympathetic region, despite 
being hunted by a brigade of 4,500 troops, but was killed in a daring 
raid in May 2011 on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Pakistani
 villagers in tribal regions have been known to keep remnants of 
exploded munitions and even unexploded shells in their homes, which has 
caused similar incidents in the past.

The volatile region is still seen as a potential flashpoint in the fraught relations between nuclear powers Pakistan and their neighbours India.

The leader of India's anti-corruption party this week called for a referendum on whether army should stay in Kashmir and Jammu to deal with internal security threats.

AAP leader Prashant Bhushan said: 'People should be asked whether they want the Army to handle the internal security of Kashmir.

'Any decision which does not have the backing of the people is undemocratic. If people feel that the Army is violating human rights and they say they don't want the Army to be deployed for their security then the Army should be withdrawn from the hinterland,'

The lawyer-activist, however, made it known that the government had the prerogative to decide on troop deployment along the country's borders.

'The government can decide if the Army needs to be deployed to deal with external threats along the border. The government can also decide if the Army needs to be kept to help protect the minorities in the Valley. But there should be a referendum on whether people want AFSPA to continue in the Valley or not,' he said.
