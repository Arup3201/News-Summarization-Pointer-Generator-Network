The Chief Medical Officer is to write to all GPs to make it plain that abortions carried out solely on the grounds of the sex of the child are wrong.

The letter from Dame Sally Davies will clarify the law on gender abortions and will make it clear what the government thinks are the information that doctors need to make a decision in good faith.

It will also remind clinicians that the pre-signing of abortion certification forms is against the law.

Spot checks at more than 250 abortion clinics last year found evidence of blank forms being signed in anticipation of patients seeking a termination. The law states that, except in emergencies, two doctors must agree for a woman to have an abortion.

Although doctors do not have to see the woman in person, they must certify that they are aware of her circumstances and why she wants to go ahead with the procedure.

The fact that the letter will be sent out to all family doctors was revealed in an answer to a Parliamentary question by public health minister Jane Ellison earlier this month.

She said the Department of Health would then work with relevant royal colleges and medical bodies to keep the guidance under review.

A furious row blew up last month when the boss of the country’s largest abortion provider indicated that there was nothing wrong with terminating a baby on the grounds of its sex.

Ann Furedi, the chief executive of BPAS, wrote on a website that doctors are legally free to terminate pregnancies when the parents are unhappy with the sex of the child.

‘While it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion, nor is rape, or incest, or being 13 years old.’

Her comments followed the decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions - as part of a newspaper probe - for women who said they did not want girls.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said there were grounds for charges but it would not be in the public interest to proceed.

He also said the law at the moment was not clear enough because it does not specifically say that abortions should not go ahead on the grounds of the sex of the baby.

Experts say it would be difficult to prove that a decision had been taken solely on the grounds of the sex of the foetus.

Dame Sally’s letter to all GPs is an attempt to set out the steps they should take to ensure an abortion is within the law.

Last night a spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously and intend to issue further guidance.

‘First there will be a further letter from the CMO and will cover sex selective abortions, pre-signing of abortion certification forms and the information that doctors need to make a decision in good faith.

‘Departmental officials will also be working closely with professional bodies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the British Medical Association and the General Medical Council, to discuss what further support and guidance clinicians might need.’
