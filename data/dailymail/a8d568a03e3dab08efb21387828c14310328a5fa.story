Lawmakers in Michigan and Texas want their states to join Arizona and require high school seniors to pass a written civics test before they can graduate.

The questions would be drawn from the same test legal immigrants must take before they can become U.S. citizens.

Some of the material is comparatively easy for anyone who's seen Saturday Night Live – 'What is the name of the President of the United States?' – while others could be tricky for 18-year-olds who get their news from Facebook.

For instance: 'In what year was the U.S. Constitution written?' Hint: It's not 1776.

SCROLL DOWN TO TAKE THE TEST 

EPIC MISSION: Michigan state representative Peter Lucido wants high school seniors to put off graduation until they can score a 60 on a basic civics test

EPIC FAIL: State representative Bill Zedler wants the bill made law in Texas, but he doesn't know when World War II started

History: This man wrote the Declaration of Independence. Can you name him?

Michigan state Rep. Peter Lucido and Texas state Rep. Bill Zedler, both Republicans, have legislation in the works to tell boards of education statewide to insert the tests of basic American facts into school curricula.

Flunk it, and high school students will have to study and try again. A 60 per cent score is required for a passing grade – the same target used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

'We require immigrants to have a basic understanding and appreciation for American civics,' Lucido said in a statement on Friday, first reported by Mlive.com.

'Why should the threshold be any different for citizens who are lucky enough to be born in the United States?'

Perhaps surprisingly, the Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals opposes the idea, saying students already have enough standardized tests to study for as they exit high school.

'We also have a long-standing position that high school content standards need to be focused on career and college readiness,' said the group's assistant director for government relations, Robert Kefgen.

Before he became U.S. President, Dwight D. Eisenhower was a military general. But which war did he fight in?

Laguna Beach in California is on the U.S. west coast. But is this ocean the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the Arctic?

QUICK: Do you know which of these men is the Chief Justice of the United States? And what's his name?

Lucido, who won his first election in November, could file his bill as soon as Tuesday, when Michigan's general assembly is seated for the year. 

Zedler has already introduced his bill in Texas.

'When you start having students graduate from high school who don’t know where we got our independence from and that kind of stuff, I think it’s a little frightening,' he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

He said he hasn't taken the test himself, but 'I think I would do pretty well.'

'I know the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. I know World War II was started Dec. 7, 1941. I know what the Civil War was fought over.'

Actually, World War II started in September 1939, and regional skirmishes that led to it began even earlier.

The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but the U.S. didn't enter the conflict until the following day.

New legislation: On Thursday, Arizona governor, Doug Ducey (pictured, left, on Friday) signed new legislation requiring all high school students in the state to pass the US citizenship test on civics before they can graduate

Arizona already has a similar law, signed on January 15 by Gov. Doug Ducey. It's a project of the Arizona-based Joe Foss Institute, which is circulating model legislation in all 50 states.

The group wants the idea adopted nationwide by 2017, and says as many as 15 state legislatures could float proposals this year alone. 

North Dakota's House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved their bill the same day Ducey signed the Arizona bill into law. 

Utah, South Dakota and Tennessee also have bills under consideration.

The civics test idea is already law in Arizona and as many as 15 more states are expected to consider it this year 

@highlight

Questions are drawn from the same citizenship test legal immigrants have to pass 

@highlight

A 60 per cent score is required

Don't get cocky: The Texas lawmaker who proposed his state's bill didn't know when World War II started
