A 16-year-old Arizona mother could be facing criminal charges after her newborn baby was discovered abandoned in a shed with head injuries.

Sheriff's deputies were called to an east Mesa home at around 3:15 p.m. Sunday when the teen reported giving birth. When they arrived, they discovered the young woman, who hasn't been identified, bleeding profusely.

Family members said they had found the placenta but couldn't locate the child, prompting a panicked search. The little girl was found half an hour later in an outbuilding attached to the bathroom where the mother gave birth.

'Deputies stayed on scene and were very vigilant looking around the property and approximately 30 minutes later, they found the baby in the back shed area,' said Joaquin Enriquez of Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

The infant was awake and alert but was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, including a possible skull fracture. On Monday, she was in stable condition and officials said she was expected to survive.

The mother was also rushed to hospital.

The teen could face charges because she could have dropped the infant off at a nearby hospital or fire station under Arizona's 'Safe Haven' law but didn't.

The 2001 law allows anyone to anonymously drop off unharmed infants within 72 hours of their birth, no questions asked.

The home is located around the corner from a fire station and about a mile from a hospital.

The teenage mother is under observation at the hospital. She has not been arrested, but detectives are treating this as a potential criminal investigation.

Child Protective Services has been contacted and is working with deputies to determine exactly what happened.

Raising awareness of the 12-year-old law has proved a challenge, Phoenix Fire Deputy Chief Chris Ketterer told Azcentral.com.

'It breaks my heart to hear that sometimes they simply don't know what to do and they choose to discard the child as if they were trash,' he said. 'This is not a birth control or right-to-life issue. The child is here. How are we going to deal with it?

'If we could just get that information to an adult and say, "You don't have to offer any information, just pass the child into our hands. We'll take the child, give it the care it needs ... and ask no questions of you."'
