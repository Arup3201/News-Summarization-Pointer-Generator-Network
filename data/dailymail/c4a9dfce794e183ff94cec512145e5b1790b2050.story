Actress Emma Watson 
has launched a scathing attack on social media, claiming it is 
responsible for young people losing their innocence.

The
 23-year-old, who is best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, said that teenagers are becoming more self-conscious at a 
younger age because of the pictures uploaded to social media sites.

Watson
 claimed this is ‘shortening’ their childhoods and the 'blissful' period
 when young girls aren't concerned about what they look like.

She said: ‘I think it’s amazing how 
self-aware people are becoming as a result of constantly posting images 
on Facebook and Instagram.

‘They’re blissfully unaware their 
childhoods are being shortened. That period of time when you’re not 
self-conscious is sped up.’

Watson
 made the comments at the Cannes launch of her new film The Bling Ring 
which portrays the impact of social media on young people.

Based on a true story, Watson plays a wealthy pole-dancing socialite jailed for robbery after her friends are caught out bragging about their crimes online.

The gang tracked stars such as Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan online and stole goods worth £2million.

Miss Watson revealed she watched ‘a lot of the Kardashians and Paris Hilton’ to prepare for the role.

Speaking alongside co-stars Israel 
Broussard, Katie Chang, Taissa Farmiga and Claire Julien, she said: ‘I 
think technology is playing a really big part in a sense that everything
 has started moving so much quicker.

‘We are becoming saturated with images. They can embody whatever they [fans] project onto that image.

‘It’s very different; it has very little to do with reality.’

The film's director Sofia
 Coppola added that the film demonstrates how social media has 
transformed how young people view fame and that most will do anything to
 achieve notoriety.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'The 
whole story seemed to say so much about our time and growing up with 
Facebook and Twitter. This could never had happened 10 years ago.

'I was thinking how these kids must 
be affected by all of that and how reality TV seems so normal now to all
 of them having grown up with it. The idea of no privacy has become the 
norm.'

Coppola originally read the true story which the film is based on in a magazine.

Fears: Miss Watson said she worries that teenagers are spending too much time on social networks

She added: 'I think their quotes 
really struck me; how they didn't seem to think they had done anything 
wrong, and how they were most interested in the fame the robberies had 
brought them.'

Miss Watson, who was just 
nine-years-old when she was cast as Hermione for the Harry Potter 
films,  was the picture of classic Hollywood glamour.

She wore a backless floor-length 
black and white gown with a sweetheart neckline, and had pulled her hair
 up into an elegant chignon.

The star also appeared to be sporting a ‘helix piercing’ looking like three diamond ear cuffs on her left ear.
