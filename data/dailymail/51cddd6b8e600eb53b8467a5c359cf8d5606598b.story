The Ebola outbreak was the most-discussed topic in the U.S. on Facebook for 2014, according to a new Year In Review report released by the social networking site.

Second up was the ice bucket challenge viral-video phenomenon in support of ALS research followed by the suicide of actor and comedian Robin Williams in August.

Sporting events were other contenders for the top spots, with the NFL Super Bowl ranking fourth place and the FIFA World Cup Brazil at number six.

Facebook compiled the rankings based on how often a topic was mentioned among its one billion-plus users between January and December 2014.

Another issue to spark conversation was the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, which captured a global audience.

The incident was the fifth most-talked about topic in the U.S., beating the ongoing conflict in Gaza (number seven) and the Republican-led U.S. midterm elections (number eight).

Nine months on, the mystery surrounding the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 continues to be a hot talking point.
