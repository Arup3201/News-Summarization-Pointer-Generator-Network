A school bus driver has been removed from her route after she snapped a selfie showing her apparently swigging from a bottle of beer behind the wheel.

The driver, whose named has not been released, then shared the photo online, WXIX reported.

She was immediately suspended by First Student Bus Company, which operates in Princeton, Ohio, while it conducts an internal investigation. It is not clear if she is still being paid by the company.

'We are incredibly disappointed by our driver's actions,' it said in a statement.

Thoughtless: A female driver has been removed from her route in Princeton, Ohio after sharing this image to social media. It shows her pretending to swig from a beer bottle at the end of her route

They said that they have learned that the photo was taken at the end of the driver's route and that no students were on board. The bottle was also not open, they said.

Still, 'this behavior is completely unacceptable', the statement said.

The Princeton School District said that they are investigating the incident with the bus company. 

'Our main concern is the safety and security of our students,' said Ed Theroux, district superintendent, in a statement to the Cincinnati Enquirer. 

'This is not acceptable behavior under any circumstances. Princeton City School District does not condone this type of behavior and First Student doesn't either.'

Anger: The bus company called her conduct 'completely unacceptable' and said there would be an internal investigation - but parents said they believed the woman should be fired from her job

But parents said the woman should not be allowed to drive buses for the district again.

'She shouldn't go back,' Sadie Leporati, the mother of a student, told WXIX. 'She should absolutely get fired. It was very inappropriate and very poor judgment on her part.' 

The company also serves the Cincinnati, Reading and Wyoming school districts, according to the Enquirer.
