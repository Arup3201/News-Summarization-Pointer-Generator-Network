Former Brazil defender Alex, who has been left out of his country’s squad for the 2014 World Cup, has joined AC Milan from Paris Saint-Germain.

The 31-year-old was a regular alongside countryman Thiago Silva as PSG retained the Ligue 1 title under Laurent Blanc last season and the French Cup.

But the imminent signing of David Luiz from Chelsea means that chances will be limited for Alex next term and he has taken the opportunity to move to Serie A with Milan.

'I’m very happy to be here at Milan, everyone has said good things about the club to me,' the player told the Milan TV channel on Thursday.

'I’m really excited to be able to pull on the Milan shirt and I’m ready to fight for the team and the club.'

Alex signed for PSG from Chelsea in 2012 after spending eight years at the Premier League side, although he was loaned to PSV Eindhoven for three seasons.

Success: Alex won two Ligue 1 titles and the French Cup during his two seasons at PSG
