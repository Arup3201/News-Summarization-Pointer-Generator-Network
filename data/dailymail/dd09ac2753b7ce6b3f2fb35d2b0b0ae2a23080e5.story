Robert Durst has been transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face a murder charge as questions surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. 

The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday.

Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York. 

And now, Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to probe links between Durst and 16-year-old Karen Marie Mitchell, who vanished after leaving her aunt's store in 1997. Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag.

Five months earlier, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco. Durst was in the Bay area at the time, CBS reported.

Robert Durst grinned as he was transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday

Law enforcement officers stand outside the building where Robert Durst is believed to own three condominiums on Tuesday in Houston, Texas. Cops and the FBI searched the millionaire's home and left with two boxes, possibly of evidence

In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. 

Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday.

A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment. 

The magistrate agreed Durst should stay in the city jail so he could help his defense team prepare for his weapons case. But the sheriff's office said in its brief that lawyers could have 'virtually unrestricted access' to Durst with 24 hours' notice to the prison.

Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney in New Orleans, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

As Durst was placed in psychiatric care on Tuesday, police raided his home in Houston, removing two boxes of possible evidence. 

Seven officers searched Durst's home for several hours at a 17-story condominium building in an upmarket neighborhood before carrying out two white cardboard document boxes.

Around 8.30pm the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two  boxes to their six vehicles and left.

FBI agents were participating in the operation at the request of the LAPD, a spokeswoman said. The LAPD would not comment until Durst was in the department's custody.

Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997

Five months before Miss Mitchell's disappearance, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco

Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building.

'I don't know what they're looking for. I don't know what they could be looking for 15 years after Susan Berman was killed 1,500 miles away... I think it's a publicity stunt. 

'I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,' he said. 'They can search now till kingdom come. They're not going to find anything because there isn't anything.' 

Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.'

Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to speak to those investigating Durst in LA and New Orleans about a missing teenage girl from the late 90s, NBC News reported on Tuesday.

Karen Mitchell, 16, vanished in  Eureka, California, on November 25, 1997.

Author, Matt Birkbeck, who has written repeatedly about Durst, claimed to CBS that Durst had been seen with the teen at a homeless shelter where she volunteered.

Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said on Tuesday that he believed foul play was involved in the girl's disappearance and that he wanted to know more about the time when Durst was in California.

However he cautioned against any conclusions being drawn too quickly.   

Durst was being held in Louisiana on drug and weapons charges after being found with a quarter-pound of marijuana and a revolver during his arrest on Saturday. It's not clear how soon he will be returned to California.

The real estate mogul was charged on Monday in LA with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. 

He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. 

Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana on Tuesday

In the six-part documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, the 71-year-old mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. 

But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote.

Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation.

Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston condo building for 18 months, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him.

He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well.

Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room.

Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest.

'The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,' he said. 'We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.'

The judge in New Orleans has scheduled another hearing for next Monday.
