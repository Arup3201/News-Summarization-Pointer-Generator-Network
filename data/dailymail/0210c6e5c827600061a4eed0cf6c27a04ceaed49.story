In time, the current storm of unrest raging around the England team may serve a positive purpose. Stuart Lancaster believes that he and his players are finding out what the World Cup will be like — 10 months early.

As the tournament hosts trying to satisfy an expectant nation, demands will be sky-high and tolerance of failure extremely limited. There will be no allowances made for the age-profile of the team, or their lack of caps compared to leading rivals.

In the harsh glare of the global showpiece in this country, the head coach knows that it is a case of deliver or be damned.

That equation is already coming to pass during this QBE autumn series. England have been regrouping and developing and learning since Lancaster took charge in the aftermath of the last World Cup, but now the time has come for positive momentum and it is eluding them.

Five defeats on the bounce is cause for alarm, no matter who the opposition and no matter how many untimely injuries.

Last Saturday’s defeat at the hands of South Africa has acted as a tipping point. Media criticism has been accompanied by sometimes ugly social-media barbs from disgruntled English supporters —with Dylan Hartley particularly targeted on Twitter after being sin-binned during the latest defeat.

In the eye of the storm, England are circling the wagons. Lancaster yesterday lifted the lid on his personal torment. The head coach has been the subject of largely positive commentary since replacing Martin Johnson, but he is feeling the heat as progress has stalled.

The England players are finding out the pressure of playing at home under extreme expectation

‘It’s hard to take,’ he said. ‘It hurts. It hurts when you lose when you’re England and it should do. It hurts me personally because I’m responsible for the team and it hurts the players. No-one accepts it as part of the job because you don’t want it to happen, but when it does come you’ve just got to accept it for what it is.

‘More importantly, you have to make sure that you and all the other guys keep some perspective about what you’re trying to do and what you’re trying to achieve. It’s when the pressure starts to affect the team that the problems begin. My sense is that we’re disappointed with ourselves but we have to believe in what we’re doing.’

Lancaster has been stung by the criticism and revealed that he finds it hard to escape from it. ‘It’s not nice and it’s not taken lightly,’ he said. ‘It’s not very easy to tune out from it. My way of dealing with it is to look at the areas of the game that we could have controlled and done better and to understand why they happened.

Lancaster has defended his team, but he may have to change his half-back combination to Ford and Youngs

‘Secondly, but probably most important, it’s about thinking about selection and thinking about who deserves an opportunity now and who perhaps doesn’t deserve that opportunity.

‘That over-rides your mind, but also how you deal with the pressure that comes on the team, so that they become resilient to it. Actually, we’re going to have pressure on us when the World Cup comes around, irrespective of the results leading up to it.

Lancaster stressed his selction dilemas, and could pick James Haskell (left) or Calum Clark against Samoa

‘That’s what comes with the expectation of being the home nation, so we better get used to it.’

Once again, Lancaster was at pains to emphasise the context of each defeat. He has been assailed by injuries and fixture clashes and form fluctuations among his leading men, but no Test coach is immune from such trials and tribulations. England have the resources to cope with most adversity. In the past, Test captain Chris Robshaw has had to withstand fierce individual pressure but it is unfamiliar territory for Lancaster.

He has understandably shown signs of stress and strain.

As ever, he is prepared to face the inquisition head-on, but the occasional terse reply shows how the pressure is affecting a naturally good-natured man.

There is a sense of exasperation and indignation among Lancaster and his staff at some aspects of the criticism.

Captain Chris Robshaw has been criticised in the past, but Lancaster is feeling the pressure for the first time

On Monday, when he was asked to address the revolving door of England midfield selection since the 2003 World Cup, he quipped: ‘I looked at those 39 centre partnerships but there’s only about three of them that involved me. I don’t see why I’m culpable for the whole centre partnership conundrum.’

This period will serve as a major examination of his composure and man-management skills.

The fur is flying and Lancaster must prove that he can initiate a revival.

It is a difficult aspect of the role he signed up for but if this is a sign of what the World Cup will be like, the man in charge of the host nation has to seize this awkward opportunity to show he can survive and thrive.
