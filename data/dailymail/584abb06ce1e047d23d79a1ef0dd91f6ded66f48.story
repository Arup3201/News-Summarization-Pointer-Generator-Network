A British schoolgirl is battling one of the world’s rarest diseases which attack every organ in her body on a daily basis.

Millie Hough, aged seven, suffers from Alstrom syndrome, a genetic disorder which has seen her become close to blind-deaf and suffer from kidney failure and dilated cardiomyopathy  as well as a series of other debilitating illnesses.

Alstrom is so rare that Millie, from St Agnes, Cornwall, is just one of 60 sufferers in the UK, and one of 266 cases worldwide. The odds of inheriting the disease are just over a million to one.

Brave: Millie Hough, seven, from St Agnes, Cornwall,  has genetic disorder Alstrom syndrome, an illness which causes multi-organ dysfunction

Although Millie still attends school four days a week, and loves practicing swimming and judo, her parents know that she will inevitable need an organ transplant in the future.

Her mother Michelle said her and her businessman husband Ben first noticed symptoms when Millie developed a strange sensitivity to light.

After numerous several doctors’ appointments the couple were given the grave news she was suffering from Alstrom syndrome.

The
 disorder is inherited which means both Michelle and Ben will have 
carried the faulty genes without being affected themselves.

Alström Syndrome is a very rare recessively inherited genetic disorder. Both parents have to carry the gene mutation for the child to be affected and the disease can make itself known in the first weeks of a child's life.

In nearly all cases, children suffer progressive loss of sight and hearing, obesity and insulin resistance, photophobia and nystagmus.

It is also common to suffer from liver and kidney failure, type 2 diabetes, cardiomyopathy and bladder and bowl problems.

Ms Hough, 41, who is now her daughter’s full-time carer and a volunteer for the national charity Alstrom Syndrome UK, said the diagnosis was ‘devastating.’

She said: ‘Alstrom syndrome affects 
all the organs in the body. It was such a shock to be told and when I 
read the signs and prognosis it was just horrific.

‘The chances of getting it are a million to one and only 60 people have been officially diagnosed with it in the UK.

‘I
 remember thinking, ‘wouldn’t it be horrific if she lost her sight’ but 
now it’s the life-threatening problems like heart failure which are 
scary.’

First described by Carl-Henry Alström 
in Sweden in 1959, Alstrom syndrome is a result of 79 possible mutations
 in the gene ALMS1.

Tragedy: Millie, pictured with her mother Michelle and family friend Rik Bennett who is running the London Marathon to raise money for Millie, is almost blind, nearly deaf and has severe kidney problems

The 
earliest symptoms include childhood obesity, blindness due to congenital
 retinal dystrophy, hearing loss and photophobia (sensitivity to light).

Sufferers
 often develop early-onset type 2 diabetes, renal and hepatic 
dysfunction affecting the liver and kidneys, bladder and bowel problems,
 and cardiomyopathy, where the heart is weakened and enlarged.

Future prospects: As her condition worsens, Millies family knows she may need a heart transplant as well as other organs

It’s likely that Millie will eventually need a heart transplant to survive and will have a reduced life expectancy.

Michelle said: ‘Heart failure is a massive worry and when she needs the transplant.

'Will there be one there and will anyone be kind enough to donate their loved one’s organs?

‘I just hope that medical advances will improve and her chances of surviving will be better.

‘She is just the most loving little girl and she will give anything a go.

'She knows what’s wrong and we don’t hide it from her.

‘We try and do everything that you would do with a normal child.

‘Her life may not be as long as we were expecting or would want it to be, and we just don’t know what her life expectancy will be, but we appreciate every minute with her and she has taught us to live like that.

‘She just brings so much to my life. She is wonderful and if I had the choice not to have her at all or to have her with Alstrom syndrome I would have chosen her every time.’

Alstrom syndrome UK is run by volunteers like Michelle and every donation goes to researching the rare disorder.
