Fans of craft beer will soon be able to pick up a pint made from hops grown at famous locations around London, including two Royal parks, the Natural History Museum, Tower Bridge and Battersea Power Station.

Hops used to brew beer have been harvested by volunteers as part of an initiative to create a beer made by Londoners that reflects the 'true flavour' of the capital.

London-based craft brewery, Meantime Brewing, collected the hops from around the city -  that it said have flourished over the summer months - to create the city's first beer, which will be named by the public and sold in pubs across the capital by the end of the year.

London-based Meantime Brewing has 
collected the hops, which it says have flourished over the summer 
months - to create the city's first beer, which will be named by the 
public and on sale in pubs across the capital by the end of the year. Here they are seen growing near the Houses of Parliament (left) and the Shard (right)

Around 10lb of useable hops were collected and will be sued to make 10 hectolitres of beer - or around 1,600 pints.

The company's brewmaster, Alastair Hook, said: 'This will be a beer made by Londoners, for Londoners.'

Dozens of pubs have contributed to the brew by growing hops in their beet gardens, balconies and rooftops, as well as in allotments and gardens.

The harvested hops will be used to make a beer, which will be named by members of the public who will vote on suggestions made via Twitter and Facebook.

The flowers will be used to create a 'wet hop' harvest beer at the Meantime Brewery in Greenwich and have helped to cultivate modern craft brewing businesses in recent years as the diverse variety of the plants has enabled brewers to be more creative in the beers they produce.

The company said: 'It will be ready to drink by the end of the year. The brew will be available in pubs around London to be enjoyed by those who have contributed to its making.'

London is currently enjoying a dramatic revival in brewing and the city is now home to around 40 breweries of different sizes - a huge increase from just a few years ago when the industry had all but died out in the capital and just a handful of breweries were left.

Nick Miller, Meantime’s CEO, said: 'London is an exciting place to be a 
brewer right now. The variety of ingredients at our disposal is huge and
it allows us to pack flavour into our beer.

'More than ever, the public are interested
in ingredients and where they come from – the hop gardens have got 
people talking and asking questions about how their beer is brewed.'

'While brewing was an industry that 
declined to an almost terminal point in London during the 1990s, a new 
generation of modern craft businesses has got it back on its feet and 
there are some fantastic beers that are bold, full of flavour and 
character – just like the city itself.'

London has a long connection with hop picking.

Between the 1920s and 1950s, about 200,000 East Enders - mostly women and children - made an annual pilgrimage to Kentish hop gardens via special trains fro London Bridge railway station.

It was so popular that the event was known as the 'Londoner's holiday' and has attracted pickers from London for centuries.
