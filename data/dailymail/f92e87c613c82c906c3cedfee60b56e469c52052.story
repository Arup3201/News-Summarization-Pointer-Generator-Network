A rare Roman fort and marching camp have been discovered by archaeologists - thanks to the summer heatwave.

The outlines of the major Roman fort complex were revealed under parched grassland near Brecon, Mid Wales.

Aerial archaeologist Dr Toby Driver said he couldn't believe his eyes when he spotted the huge hidden ancient fort from the air.

The summer drought has also revealed scores of Iron Age farms and forts across South Wales which have usually been hidden beneath lush crop fields.

Dr Driver, from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales said the spell of hot weather discoveries include some of the most significance finds for a decade.

He said: 'When crop marks show in drought conditions our aerial survey only has a few weeks to record the sites before rain or harvest removes them.

'The Roman fort complex discovery near Brecon is a rare discovery for Wales.'

He said it was made following a tip from Dr Jeffrey Davies, who he has been working with on Roman villa excavations near Aberystwyth.

Dr Driver said: 'Jeffrey Davies noticed an anomaly in Roman coin finds near Brecon, reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

'He had a hunch that the coins, of the Emperor Claudius, could indicate a lost early Roman fort, and passed a grid reference to me the day before a flight into central Wales.

'I couldn't believe my eyes when the pilot and I approached the location and saw fading crop marks of a major Roman fort complex, lost beneath fields and a road for nearly 2,000 years.'

Between Caerwent and Chepstow, the aerial survey also pinpointed only the second Roman overnight marching camp in Monmouthshire- which Dr Driver said appears to show a small expeditionary force on manoeuvres in the years around 50 AD.

Scores of Iron Age farms and forts were also found during the summer heatwave in Pembrokeshire and the Vale of Glamorgan.

West of Caerwent, in South Wales, a 'remarkable' Iron Age settlement was revealed beneath the parched ground.

In Pembrokeshire, one of the largest and most complex Iron Age defended farms in Pembrokeshire was found at Conkland Hill, Wiston.Dr Driver added: 'Given the decades of aerial survey in the region around Caerwent, these surprise discoveries show the continuing need for aerial archaeology in Wales.'The crop of summer discoveries follow similarly exciting Bronze Age ones made during last winter's snow.The Royal Commission will now begin cataloguing and mapping the discoveries to make the information more widely available online.
