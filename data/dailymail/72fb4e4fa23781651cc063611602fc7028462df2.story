Britain is facing a shortage of goat's cheese following a slump in production across Europe, industry experts have revealed today.

Middle-class kitchens and posh restaurants alike may have to go without following a decimation of stocks across Europe, it has been claimed.

Low supply coupled with an increase in demand during the festival period will see prices of what is produced soar, some experts have said.

Shortage: Many middle-class kitchens and restaurants could have to go without goat's cheese this Christmas period after a Europe-wide shortage

The shortage follows a cull of more than 50,000 pregnant goats 
and sheep across Europe in 2010 to rid herds of the 
disease Q Fever - which can spread from animals to humans, trade journal The Grocer reported.

This not only meant an inevitable fall in stock, but many farmers stopped breeding the animals after they lost almost all of their livelihoods due to the cull.

Experts said today that the situation is a 'perfect storm' of rising demand at a time when stocks are low.

Goat's cheese is traditionally in high demand during the festive period, along with many other upmarket foods.

Last week it was announced the cost of chocolate would increase by up to a third.

Crippling
rises in the price of cocoa butter could add 21p to the cost of every 
100g of milk chocolate by December, experts said.

They added it would affect everything from expensive truffles to festive advent calendars and even chocolate coins.

The
cost of producing chocolate has gone up by 33 per cent in the last year.

This is thanks to a 70 per cent rise in the price of cocoa butter, a 50 per 
cent rise in milk powder prices and a 15 per cent increase in whey 
powder costs.

So far, chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs - but this may change with the Christmas rush.

Howard Newmarch of specialist 
cheesemaker Eurilait said: 'Inevitably there will be allocations to 
ensure that customers are supplied in part, but not totally what they 
would ideally want.'

George Paul, director of rivals 
Bradburys, added: 'Retailers would either need to pay more for goat 
products or risk being left short.

'One or the other will give shortly - it'll either be price or availability.'

It would seem that cheese is not the only item that may be too costly for the average kitchen in the run up to Christmas this year.

Last week it was announced the cost of chocolate was set to soar by up to a third.

Crippling rises in the price of cocoa butter may add 21p to the cost of every 100g of milk chocolate by December, experts said.

They added that it would affect everything from truffles to advent calendars and chocolate coins.

Cocoa powder and sugar have fallen in price, but they account for a much smaller proportion of production costs.

So far, chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs.

There has been a small 7.5 per cent rise in the price of a Cadburyâ€™s Dairy Milk bar, while a box of Quality Street costs 14.3 per cent more.

But with peak season approaching, there may be price hikes to come ahead of the Christmas rush.
