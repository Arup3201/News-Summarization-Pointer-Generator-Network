'Busy': Richard Baker made a 'Max Speed 20mph' sign after police claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside his home

Police told a pensioner that they were too busy to deal with speeders using his road – but turned up within 30 minutes after he put up a DIY warning sign.

Officers in Newbury, Berkshire, claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside pensioner Richard Baker’s terraced home.

So he made a ‘Max Speed 20mph’ sign and stuck it on the roadside –only to find an officer on his doorstep demanding that he remove the notice half an hour later.

Mr Baker, 71, said he and his partner Rosemary Cribb fear someone will be knocked down and killed by the ‘mad’ drivers.

‘No one will do anything about the speeding, but put up an illegal sign and all of a sudden you get the police banging on your door,’ he said.

‘All I want to do is stop people speeding before there’s a tragedy – somebody’s got to do something about it. 

'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources.

‘But they can very soon find the time to send someone round to knock on my front door.

‘I put up the sign and inside 30 minutes an officer was round here telling me to take it down.

‘I’m just so frustrated – has it got to take someone’s death for them to do anything about the speeding traffic?’

'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources,' Mr Baker said

Mr Baker’s road was made a 20mph zone in 2010 after repeated requests from worried residents and local councillors.

But Mr Baker said signs warning motorists that it is a 20mph limit are not clearly displayed and pointed out that even some of his neighbours are not aware of the speed restrictions.

He said: ‘This morning a woman complained to my daughter that it isn’t 20 along this road, it’s 30mph. She came back and said she was totally unaware it was 20mph.’

A police spokesman said they would investigate Mr Baker’s complaints.
