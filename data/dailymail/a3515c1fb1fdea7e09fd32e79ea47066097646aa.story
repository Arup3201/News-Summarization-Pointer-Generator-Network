A woman whose parents were found buried in their back garden has admitted her motherâ€™s manslaughter.

Susan Edwards, 56, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Patricia Wycherley but maintained her not guilty plea to two counts of murder at the start of a trial at Nottingham Crown Court.

Edwards and her husband Christopher, 57, both deny murdering Mrs Wycherley and her husband William, whose bodies were discovered in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October.

Mr and Mrs Wycherley's remains were recovered from the garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October following a tip-off to police

The remains of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were recovered by police from the grounds of their two-bedroom home last October.

The couple are alleged to have been murdered by their daughter and son-in-law between May 1 and 5, 1998.

Yesterday Nottinghamshire Police released the first pictures of Mr Wycherley as a young man and prior to his death in the late 1990s.

Both Susan and Christopher Edwards, of no fixed address, admitted a charge of obstructing the coroner at an earlier hearing at the same court.

They also each admitted a charge of theft of a credit balance from a Halifax bank account.

A jury was sworn in and then sent away for the day. High Court judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall adjourned the case until 10.30am tomorrow, when Peter Joyce QC will open the prosecution case.
