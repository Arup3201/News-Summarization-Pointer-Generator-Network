The BBC's flagship children’s show Blue Peter is to be cut to one edition a week and moved to a digital station – with just a repeat  on BBC1.

It marks a profound change for the programme, which has been screened on BBC1 first since its launch in 1958.

There are currently two editions weekly and at one stage there were three, plus spin-off documentaries. However, viewing figures have slipped in recent years.

From January, it will be screened first on digital channel CBBC, with a repeat on the corporation’s main channel the following day.

Presenters: Andy Akinwolere, Helen Skelton and Barney Harwood. Blue Peter popularised the phrase 'here's one I made earlier', and children would have to keep a ready supply of toilet roll tubes and sticky-back plastic to hand while watching

The series, which has become a cornerstone of children’s lives for generations, will begin to premiere on the digital station from January 12.

Blue Peter is the world's longest-running children's television show first broadcast on October 16 1958.

The show lasted for 15 minutes and it was supposed to fill a six week gap in scheduling.

The programme is named after the blue and white flag flown on a ship's yard arm to show it was ready to go to sea.

The signature tune has always been a hornpipe, originally using variations of Barnacle Bill.

On March 2011 it became the first programme in the UK to broadcast an entire show in 360 degrees on the web.

The youngest ever presenter was Yvette Fielding who joined the programme at just 18

Blue Peter popularised the phrase 'here’s one I made earlier', and for many years children would have to keep a ready supply of toilet roll tubes and sticky-back plastic to hand while watching.

It is presented by daredevil Helen Skelton and popular CBBC presenter Barney Harwood, but in recent years has been a launchpad for TV stars such as Matt Baker, Konnie Huq and Anthea Turner.

Other famous names who have been given their big breaks over the year have included Valerie Singleton, Janet Ellis, John Noakes and Peter Purves.

A spokeswoman for the programme said:
'The amount of airtime we devote to Blue Peter remains exactly the 
same, we are just scheduling it differently.

'It
will still have a regular slot - now all year round - but we’ll have 
flexibility to introduce additional specials that will go into more 
depth on events and activities.'

These
will include a 'Stargazing Live' special next month, and there will be a
nine-part series following Skelton’s trip to the South Pole for Helen’s
South Pole trip.

There will also be a series of special shows following
the Olympic torch relay.

The show will be screened for the 
first time each Thursday, with the BBC1 repeat the following day.

It 
will get a further airing on CBBC over the weekend.

Viewing
for the BBC1 show had been slipping over the years and channel bosses 
had increased the emphasis on its digital screenings.

A move to a CBBC 
premiere had been mooted some months ago.

The BBC emphasised that the show would run throughout the year, rather than taking a summer break.

At one stage the programme was broadcast three times a week, plus spin-off shows.

The show has helped launch the careers of presenters including Matt Baker, top left, and Konnie Huq, bottom left. They are pictured with fellow presenters Liz Barker and Simon Thomas in 2000

1. Lulu, the unruly elephant, 1969: The old maxim to never work with children or animals rang true as a baby elephant ran amok in the studio. Lulu first defecated on the studio floor, before standing on presenter John Noakes' foot, then dragged her keeper along the ground before finally the hapless Noakes stepped in the mess Lulu made.

2. Tracy Island, 1993: The most popular 'how-to' guide in Blue Peter history, Anthea Turner's demonstration of building a replica Thunderbirds base using papier-mache and toilet paper tubes garnered 100,000 factsheet requests. Turner still has the Tracy Island she made on the show.

3. The garden is wrecked, 1983: The Blue Peter Garden was vandalised, leaving a generation of children shocked by scenes of trampled vegetation, damage to a plaque made by a handicapped child, and a broken urn. The goldfish in the pond was poisoned. Some years later former Tottenham and England striker Les Ferdinand admitted he 'helped a few people over the wall' but said he did not take part in the vandalism.

4. Richard Bacon gets sacked, 1998: Presenter Richard Bacon was sacked after he admitted taking cocaine. He apologised to viewers via a statement after being exposed by defunct Sunday tabloid paper the News Of The World. Bacon now presents a late night chat show on BBC Radio 5 Live.

5. John Noakes climbs Nelson's Column, 1977: The daring host climbed Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, using only a ladder and no safety ropes. Noakes was also famous for his relationship with Blue Peter dog, Shep, who he kept as a pet after leaving the show. Anne Robinson reduced Noakes to tears on quiz show the Weakest Link in 2008 when she asked what had happened to the dog, which died in 1987.

6. Helen Skelton kayaks 2,000 miles down the Amazon, 2010: The daredevil host became the first woman to kayak the length of the Amazon river for Sport Relief. Skelton set off on January 20 near Nauta in Peru, and finished 2,010 miles downstream at Almerim in Brazil. Despite never having been in a kayak before starting training, she paddled around 60 miles a day for six days a week to reach the target, enduring blisters, heatstroke and the sight of wildlife such as anacondas.

7. Andy Akinwolere conquers his fears to break two world records, 2011: Not to be outdone by his co-host Skelton, the brave presenter conquered a crippling fear of open water to set a pair of world records for swimming one of the deepest stretches of water on the planet. The host could barely swim a length a matter of weeks before he swam five miles across the Palau Trench, an 8,000 metre deep abyss in the Pacific Ocean. Akinwolere has not only become the first person to swim across the deepest part of the trench, but he now holds the record for the deepest location for an open water swim.
