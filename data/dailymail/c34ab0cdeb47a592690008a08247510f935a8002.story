It may lay claim to being the 'Happiest Place on Earth', a magical kingdom ruled by fairytale princesses and the like, but even Disneyland was still built with bricks, mortar and hard graft.

The only theme park to have been completely overseen by Walt Disney himself, Disneyland Park, celebrates 60 years in 2015 and extensive celebrations are planned.

A time-lapse video from the Disney archives reveals how the park, which forms half of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was built from nothing before its opening on July 17, 1955.

The fun park, the only one of its kind to be fully overseen by Walt Disney, opened on July 17, 1955

The site was bought in 1953 with construction beginning in 1954 and the grand opening the year after that

From an expanse of brown dirt, iconic features such as Tomorrowland's Rocket to the Moon are raised into place while Sleeping Beauty Castle emerges like a turbo episode of Grand Designs. 

Other original features rising from the earth include the Main Street Train Station's clock tower, the shell for jungle-themed Adventureland and rocky Old West throwback Frontierland. 

Looking down Main Street USA to the original Fantasyland, Sleeping Beauty's Castle forms perhaps the most iconic image of the park, which emerges like a mini-town in Orange County.

Later years have seen the introduction of New Orleans Square in 1966, Critter Country in 1972 and Mickey's Toontown in 1993, followed by an entirely new Disney California Adventure Park in 2001 - together they are now known as Disneyland Resort.

While the idea had been in his thoughts for some time, Walt Disney didn't muck about with the making of the park - purchasing a 160-acre site in 1953, beginning construction in 1954 and opening the year later.

Although it was supposed to have been unveiled in a press preview day with about 14,000 invitees on Sunday, July 17, 1955, that opening saw 28,000 people go through the gates due to thousands of counterfeit ticket sales. 

The whole affair was televised and not a good look for the company, with a series of bloopers during the coverage by ABC Television, who partly funded the project.

The first thousands of guests flood through the gates at Disneyland, the original Disney fun park

Far from the fantasy Walt  would have hoped for it was labelled internally as 'Black Sunday' after a number of operational mishaps that range from chaotic queues to a gas leak in Fantasyland that closed Fantasyland, Frontierland and Adventureland for the afternoon.  

But it was merely a minor setback for what is now Disney's Parks and Resorts division which now overseas Anaheim's Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort in Floria, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, a fleet of cruise liners and a host of hotels. 

And just like the end of this timelapse, which show the first guests arriving in Anaheim, millions continue to flood through the turnstiles - more than 130 million a year, in fact.
