The judge overseeing the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez has chastised his lawyer for making a joke about 'Deflategate' while questioning a witness in court.

James Sultan was questioning a state police trooper about tire pressure on Thursday when he jokingly asked whether the trooper had ever received 'training in football deflation devices'.

On Friday morning, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh told Sultan that they are conducting serious business, and she does not expect there to be any more jokes. Sultan agreed and expressed regret.

Hernandez is accused of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, who was dating the sister of his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins.

The former NFL star has pleaded not guilty to murder.  

'Deflategate' was the hot topic in the run-up to the Super Bowl after the New England Patriots were accused of using under-inflated footballs in their AFC championship win. The NFL is investigating.

The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl last Sunday, defeating the Seattle Seahawks.

The trial moved out of the courtroom on Friday as jurors toured several key sites in the case including the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found and Hernandez's North Attleboro home. 

Ahead of the tours, Lawyers for Hernandez agreed to remove personal and religious items before jurors toured his home.

Prosecutors cited the O.J. Simpson case in complaining that Hernandez's home, still occupied by his fiancée, had been changed to add items that might play to jurors' sympathies. 

Simpson's home was manipulated before jurors in his murder trial visited to add family photos and a Bible.

Friday's tour also will include visits to the street where Lloyd lived in Boston, the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, and four cellphone towers.
