This is the shocking moment a mass brawl broke out in a busy curry house after a group of men apparently stormed the restaurant to attack a member of staff.

The video, which has emerged online, shows the chaotic clash inside the Nawaab restaurant in the Levenshulme area of Manchester.

It shows restaurant staff, dressed in purple uniforms, grappling with a group of men amid screams from onlookers.

Shouts of 'you're dead' and 'that's my sister' can also be heard during the 50-second video.

At one point, a punch is thrown, shortly before a stool is picked up and raised overhead.

The brawl is eventually split up and one of the men is led away by a man dressed in chef whites.

Bosses at Nawaab said the fight broke out after a group of men stormed the restaurant trying to attack a staff member following a dispute 'about a woman'.

A spokesman said that staff intervened to protect their colleague and the business.

He added: 'They started to attack a staff member in a dispute about a woman which was in no way linked to the restaurant.

'Our staff were defending the restaurant. The police were called and they settled the dispute between the two parties.'

The restaurant describes itself on its website as providing 'excellent Halal cuisine in the Indian Restaurant and the beautiful on-site Asian wedding venues and banqueting suites in Manchester'.

The spokesman said the incident took place in August 2013.
