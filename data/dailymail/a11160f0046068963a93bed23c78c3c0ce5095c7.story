Santa threw Delta customers a late Christmas gift today after the airline's website allowed visitors to book round trip flights for as low as $20.

Delta Airlines didn't intend to post the low fares, but they say they will honor the 'mistake fares' purchased on their site.

Yahoo news reported that people began reporting the mistake fares on websites like flyertalk.com at 9 a.m. and that the low fares disappeared from Delta's website at 10:45 am.

Earlier this morning Delta offered round trip flights on their website for as low as $20

The fares were also available on Expedia.com, Priceline.com, and other travel websites.

Delta issues a statement after customers wondered whether or not they would be able to use their inexpensive tickets to fly to their destinations.

'For a portion of the morning today, some prices on delta.com and other booking channels were incorrectly displayed, resulting in lower than usual fares for customers,' the airline said in a statement. 'The situation has been resolved, and the correct prices are being displayed. Delta will honor any fares purchased at the incorrect price.'

ABC News reported that at 1 p.m. Google Flights still showed incredibly low fares and a fare from New York City to Los Angeles cost only $47 when it typically would cost $400.

The blogs on Flyertalk.com were flooded with cheap Delta flight finds.

'Yeah, I see a bunch of crazy DL fares this morning on google flights. DTW-MIA for $31, DTW-PHX for $52, etc. What?? Clicking through yields much higher prices. Momentary fare misload or google flights confusion?' said commenter LBJ.

Its a free ride once you've already paid, especially when you've already paid just $20

'Yup this one's crazy. OAK-MIA for $65 for NYE,' said flyertalk commenter cjwong88.

Searching for 'mistake fares' is somewhat of a hobby for some travel enthusiasts who frequent the site.

This isn't the first time an airline has had a 'mistake fare.'

Yahoo reported that earlier this year, United Airlines accidentally made fares $0 and they honored the free purchases and allowed the customer to travel.

ABC reported that Delta's contract of carriage states that in the event of an 'erroneous' fare, ' Delta reserves the right to cancel the ticket purchase and refund all amounts paid by the purchaser or, at the purchaser's option, to reissue the ticket for the correct fare.'

However a rule enforced by the Department of Transportation says that an airline must honor a ticket purchase even if it was a mistake.
