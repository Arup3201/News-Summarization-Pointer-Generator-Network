Vacancies: Hundreds of foreign nurses are being flown in to plug a crisis in NHS staffing (file picture)

Hundreds of foreign nurses are being flown in to plug a crisis in NHS staffing.

At least 40 hospital trusts have actively recruited from abroad, with 1,360 nurses being signed up from countries from Spain and Portugal to Australia and the Philippines.

With another 41 planning to launch recruitment drives, and NHS recruitment fairs scheduled for Madrid and Lisbon in January,  the number could easily double.

Budget cuts, recruitment freezes, redundancies and a reduction training posts are blamed creating a ‘hidden workforce crisis’, with almost 20,000 nursing, health visiting and midwifery posts vacant.

But while the new arrivals will help understaffed wards deal with the extra pressures of winter, there are concerns about the communication skills of some of the staff, as well as their experience and training.

While non-EU applicants must pass a rigorous English test, EU rules on freedom of labour have stopped the Nursing and Midwifery Council watchdog from carrying out language tests on Europeans before allowing them on its register.

Hospitals can set their own tests but a Mail investigation found that few do, with many assuming the new staff members will have already been asked to prove their language ability.

In recent years, patients have been told how they have been forced to use sign language to communicate with staff and some hospitals have resorted to sticking pictures of medical equipment on cupboard doors, rather than written lists, so that nurses know where to find everything.

Joyce Robins, of campaign group Patient Concern, said that elderly patients can find communication problems particularly stressful.

There are also worries about differences in training, including knowledge of the admin that forms a large part of a nurses’ duties in Britain.

In the wake of the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, where staff shortages contributed to the deaths of up to 1,200 patients, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised the NHS will recruit an extra 3,700 nurses by 2014.

He also said that hospitals will have to publish the number of nurses working on each ward.

An investigation by the Nursing Times found that 40 NHS trusts – one in three of those who responded  - has actively recruited form overseas in recent months, with Spain and Portugal the most popular countries.

In some cases, hospital are sending teams of managers abroad to find suitable staff.

Rafa Caldas, 22, a recently-qualified nurse, who has left his home in Madrid to work in Bedford, said: ‘This is my first real opportunity to work in a permanent role.

‘There is a lot of extra paperwork here, compared with Spain, where you used to have an assistant to do that kind of thing for you.’;

Penny Venables, of Worcester Acute Hospitals Trust, which has taken on 20 Spanish nurses, told the Independent on Sunday: ‘There is a lot of interest from Spain and Greece and countries where there have been economic challenges.

‘It is something every trust is doing and we would not rule out doing it again.’

Howard Catton, policy director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘When employers are getting on planes to recruit nurses, you know you have a crisis in workforce supply.

‘That is happening right here, right now.’

Labour questioned why trainee nursing training is being cut when there is a staff shortage.
