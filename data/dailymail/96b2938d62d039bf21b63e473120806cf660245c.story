Team news

Stoke

Stoke boss Mark Hughes has a full squad to choose from for the club's Barclays Premier League opener against Aston Villa at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday.

Summer signings Bojan Krkic, Mame Biram Diouf, Steve Sidwell, Phil Bardsley and Dionatan Teixeira could all make their competitive Potters debuts.

The likes of Brek Shea and Wilson Palacios look set to depart the club and Hughes has stressed that, due to numbers, some senior players he wants to retain will also have to miss out on being selected for the 18-man match squad.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Butland, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Cameron, Wilkinson, Shotton, Teixeira, Bardsley, Whelan, Nzonzi, Adam, Ireland, Sidwell, Odemwingie, Arnautovic, Walters, Crouch, Krkic, Diouf.

Aston Villa

Summer signings Joe Cole, Philippe Senderos, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho could all make their competitive debuts for Aston Villa in the club's Barclays Premier League opener against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday.

Villa boss Paul Lambert will check the condition of both Cole (thigh) and World Cup semi-finalist Ron Vlaar ahead of the match but is optimistic the pair will be able to feature, while long-term absentee Jores Okore is in contention for his first competitive appearance since September having recovered from a serious knee problem.

There could also be comebacks for Charles N'Zogbia, out for all of last season with an achilles injury, as well as Alan Hutton and Darren Bent, who have previously been exiled from the Villa first-team and out on loan. Christian Benteke (achilles) and Libor Kozak (broken leg) remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Guzan, Given, Baker, Bennett, Vlaar, Okore, Clark, Senderos, Richardson, Hutton, Cissokho, Lowton, Stevens, Bacuna, El Ahmadi, Cole, Westwood, Delph, Herd, Gardner, N'Zogbia, Grealish, Weimann, Agbonlahor, Bent.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) 

Despite winning just once on the opening weekend in the Premier League (D2 L3), Stoke are unbeaten at the Britannia Stadium on the opening day (W1 D1).

Last season’s 3-1 win over Arsenal was Paul Lambert’s first victory on the opening weekend of a Premier League season.

Peter Crouch scored a goal and assisted a goal in both of Stoke’s victories over Aston Villa last season.

Only against Blackburn (8) and Arsenal (7) has Crouch scored more Premier League goals than he has against his former team (5).

Breakthrough: Charlie Adam celebrates after scoring the opening goal in a 2-1 victory for Stoke against Aston Villa at the Britannia Stadium last December

Only Aston Villa (491) committed more fouls than Stoke City (486) in the 2013-14 Premier League.

Stoke have never recorded a positive goal difference in the Premier League. Overall the Potters have scored 233 goals in 228 Premier League matches.

Since August 2011, Villa have recorded fewer points (117 in 114 games) than any other ever-present side in that period.

Stoke summer signing Steve Sidwell scored seven Premier League goals (for Fulham) in 2013-14, as many as he managed in the previous four campaigns combined.

Villa signing Joe Cole has not assisted a Premier League goal since October 2010.

Villa conceded four goals in four of their last nine Premier League games in 2013-14.
