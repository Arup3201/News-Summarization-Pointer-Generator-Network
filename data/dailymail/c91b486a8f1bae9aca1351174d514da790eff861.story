Former Chelsea and Newcastle boss Ruud Gullit has questioned how long Luis Suarez will remain a Barcelona player after admitting his surprise at the Uruguayan's £75million move.

Suarez left Liverpool last summer to sign for the Catalan giants, going on to make his debut in October after returning from a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

The 27-year-old has only scored once in eight La Liga appearances so far and Gullit is unsure whether he can adapt to life in Spain.

Speaking to beIN Sports last weekend, Gullit said: 'It is a surprise to see Suarez at Barcelona. I don't know how long he will stay there.'

The former Ajax forward has netted twice in three Champions League appearances since swapping Merseyside for Barcelona, although his striker partners - Lionel Messi and Neymar - have both outshone him this season.

Suarez scored his first league goal in Barca's 5-0 home against Cordoba on Saturday, a result which moved Luis Enrique's men one point behind leaders Real Madrid.
