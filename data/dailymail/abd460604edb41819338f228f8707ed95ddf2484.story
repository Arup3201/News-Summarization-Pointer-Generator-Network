The distraught mother of one of the two girls gang raped and hanged in India has refused to accept any compensation from the government and demands her daughter's rapists are sentenced to death.

The 38-year-old mother said she wants the dignity of her 15-year-old daughter to be restored.

She said: 'Money can't bring back my daughter but the hanging of her killers would give peace to her soul.'

The father of one of the victims said local police were not interested in investigating his daughter's murder because he was from the lowest caste and called on the Indian version of the FBI intercede

The devastated mother said her daughter would have been alive had they not belonged to the lower Dalit caste.

Dalits, formerly called untouchables, stay at the bottom of India's tenacious caste system, while the Yadav caste, to which the state chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, belongs is the top caste.

The two cousins, aged 14 and 15, went missing from their homes on Tuesday night in a village called Katra, in Badaun district about 180 miles from Lucknow, Eastern India.

The girls went into the nearby fields to use as a toilet since their house does not have one.

The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help.

Some villagers, who had also gone out to relieve themselves in the fields, found their bodies hanging from a mango tree the next morning.

Angry villagers protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut down from the tree.

Hundreds of protestors took to the streets of New Delhi calling for justice for the two girls

The villagers only allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday.

A post mortem has confirmed that the girls were raped and died from hanging, police has said.

Police arrested a fifth suspect on Saturday. Three others arrested, who are in their 20s belong to the extended family. They have been charged with rape and murder.

Two police officers, who are alleged to have taken part in the rape have also been arrested.

The state government has ordered that the case be handled by a fast-track court.

Babu Ram, 55, the father of the 15-year-old girl said nobody listened to their grievances as they belong to a lower caste.

He said: ‘At the police station, the first thing they asked is what caste we came from. And when we told them we were Dalits, they didn’t entertain our complaints.’

He added: ‘When a girl was gang raped in Delhi people took to streets across the country so that justice can be done. But in our case, we haven’t heard of any such protests. Our country can’t be selective. Otherwise there is no hope for justice.’

There are 25,000 rapes reported in India a year but activists fear the figure is far higher as women are afraid to come forward because of fear of retribution

Official statistics report that 25,000 rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. But activists believe it is even more since women are often pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults.

The father who reported the girls missing, Sohan Lal, has demanded a federal investigation.

'I don't expect justice from the state government as state police officers shielded the suspects.'

Mr Lal was offered 500,000 rupees compensation to compensate for his daughter's death, worth around £5,000.

He said he would not accept any money until the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation - the Indian FBI - took over the case.

Ashish Gupta, state inspector-general of police in Uttar Pradesh said on average ten rapes a day were reported in his area. He said 60 percent of these attacks happen when women go into fields near the village as they do not have any toilets at home. 

Meanwhile on Thursday, police arrested three men who viciously assaulted the mother of a teenage girl who complained that her daughter had been raped.

Under Indian law rapists can be jailed for up to 20 years.
