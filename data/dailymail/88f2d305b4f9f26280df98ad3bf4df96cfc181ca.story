A Victorian Liberal Party candidate who reportedly planned to bring a Bollywood adult film star to Melbourne before the state election has been sacked.

Nitin Gursahani was the candidate for the seat of Thomastown but a Liberal Party spokesman has confirmed he is no longer endorsed.

News Corp Australia reports Mr Gursahani's family's company Kiren Australia, of which Mr Gursahani is a marketing manager, is sponsoring an event at Toorak featuring Sunny Leone on the night before the November 29 election.

Ms Leone is an Indian actress, model and Indo-Canadian adult film star and is reportedly coming to Australia for the event. 

Mr Gursahani's phone number was listed with online advertisements for one of her Melbourne events, News Corp says.

A Liberal Party spokesman said on Saturday night that Mr Gursahani was not forthcoming in the application process.

'This material does not reflect the values that underpin our party,' he said in a statement.

Sunny Leone is reportedly coming to Australia to attend the event that is held before the state election

Mr Gursahani is the second Victorian Liberal to lose his candidacy for the 2014 poll. 

It comes after Sydenham hopeful John Varano quit last Sunday over allegations he assaulted his former wife seven years ago.

Mr Varano categorically denies the charges, which he says were dismissed by a US court.
