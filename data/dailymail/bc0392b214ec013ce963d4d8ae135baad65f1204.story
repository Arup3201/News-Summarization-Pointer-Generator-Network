For the second time this week, a winter storm was barreling towards the Northeast but thankfully looked set to dump a relatively small amount of snow.

From late on Wednesday through to Thursday night, snowfall will ramp up, bringing up to six inches of snow in eastern Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

Several inches of snow was expected in Providence, Rhode Island, Boston and Portland, Maine. 

Across New York and northern New England, a dusting of snow was expected in the next 48 hours.

The worst of the snowstom was expected to blow off shore late on Thursday with the Northeast having a relatively lucky escape compared to recent weeks
