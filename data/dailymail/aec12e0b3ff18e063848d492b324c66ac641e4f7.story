A schoolgirl who killed herself after she was sexually abused was let down by police who failed to investigate, her family said yesterday.

Mary Stroman, 16, suffered years of mental torment over the abuse and told a friend she had been ‘raped and raped’ and had suffered several miscarriages.

Her parents took her clothing, phone and computer to police, but said the inquiry was abandoned after the teenager refused to cooperate, saying the men who abused her would hurt her family if she spoke to the authorities.

The coroner ruled that 16-year-old Mary took her own life after she was struck by a train in January of this year

Meanwhile her treatment for hallucinations, nightmares and flashbacks prompted by the abuse was disrupted by council funding delays, leaving her in ‘despair’, her family said.

Mary threw herself in front of a train in January, two days after an inquest began into the suicide of former classmate Tallulah Wilson who killed herself the same way.

Both attended St Marylebone School in Central London, where Mary was said to be a popular, straight-A pupil from an affluent family before the abuse started.

Her family believe she was subjected to ‘a terrible sexual trauma’ starting when she was 12 or 13. 

She told them she had been assaulted in Finsbury Park, near their home in North London, and forced to have sex in a toilet in a shopping centre in Islington.

She said she was ‘prostituted’ at a house where she was given vodka and where she eventually shot herself in the chest with a pellet gun.

Her inquest heard she began binge drinking and tried cannabis, and self-harmed as a way of ‘coping’. Three psychiatrists said she was the victim of sexual abuse which had left her with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The inquest heard Mary, pictured left and right, had a history of self-harming. At the time of her death, the teenager was living at a residential school for girls with emotional and behavioural difficulties

Mary, the youngest of five children, was admitted to The Priory three times and treated at a psychiatric unit.

Her mother Sue Stroman, 59, and husband Scott, a jazz professor, said in a statement: ‘Mary would never reveal the details and without her cooperation the Metropolitan Police felt they could not pursue an investigation.

‘It was and is a cause of continuing frustration and sorrow to us that nothing could be done to try to identify the perpetrators both for Mary’s sake and for that of other children who could similarly be at risk.’

Mr Stroman said the Rotherham sex abuse involving 1,400 children had shown abusive men exploited police inertia to prey on vulnerable teenagers. Fighting back tears he said: ‘We have one daughter, to us she’s a huge part of our life. It seems incredible the number has to get up to 1,400.’

She had to wait 13 months as Haringey Council – criticised over failures in the Baby P and Victoria Climbie deaths – approved funding for her to be admitted to Tumblewood care home in Wiltshire, the family said.

They said: 'The continual delay seriously impacted her mental health, providing her with constant false hopes, repeated disappointments and a deterioration of trust - leading at times to despair.

‘In the meantime, Mary had suffered many further months of grief and mistrust, had been subjected to a further series of assessments and had been assigned a changing series of social workers, forcing her to “tell her story” over and over. She was tired and tormented and lost confidence in the fact there was a way forward for her.

‘Though we feel the individuals who dealt with Mary from Haringey social services were sympathetic and professional, we found the overall quality of service that we received was very seriously lacking. The workings of the machine and bureaucracy were insufficient.’

Recording a verdict of suicide, Wiltshire coroner David Ridley said he did not believe the police’s failure to investigate or the council delays had ‘directly contributed’ to her death.

Haringey Council said Mary’s case was ‘complex and difficult’ and a serious case review had begun. The Metropolitan Police Service did not respond to requests for comment.
