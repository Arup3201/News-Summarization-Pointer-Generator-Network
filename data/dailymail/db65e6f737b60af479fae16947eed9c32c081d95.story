Former pro footballer Aveion Cason Sr. had a long record on the field, but a less impressive record as a father and the former running back went on Oprah’s OWN Network with the goal of patching things up with his estranged son.

Cason, who grew up fatherless himself, ended up continuing the cycle when he abandoned his young son Aveion Jr.

Cason recently came back into his son’s life. And the slew of emotions that go along with such a reunion played out in front of television cameras courtesy of Oprah’s OWN Network.

Amends: On an emotional episode of Oprah's Life Class, former pro-footballer Aveion Cason makes amends with his 13-year-old son after a 10-year estrangement

On Oprah’s Life Class with Iyanla Vanzant, Vanzant takes a head-on approach to patching up familial rifts.

‘I grew up without a father,’ said the elder Cason. ‘I feel resentment with my father coming up because he's never been around, and when I talk to my son, I feel like he feels the same way.’

For about ten years, Aveion Jr. didn’t see his father. Now 13, he mirrors his father’s resentment.

‘It felt horrible that you left me,’ Aveion Jr. says as Vanzant coaches him on. ‘It made me feel like I was a mistake... I loved the person, but I never see him.’

Like her OWN: Oprah helped facilitate the confrontation between Cason and his son Aveion Jr. as part of her Oprah's Life Class on the OWN Network

Aveion Jr.’s mother stands by as the two men try to come to terms with their estrangement.

‘I think I was a mistake,’ Aveion Jr. said as tears rolled down his young cheeks and his father shook his head in the foreground.

‘And that made you feel what,’ Iyanla asked.

‘Like I wasn't supposed to be here.’

‘What do you want to tell [him] now that he's back,’ Vanzant continued probing the boy.

‘That I love him...’ replied Aveion Jr., then with a little goading from Vanzant he commands his father, ‘You don’t get to leave me again!’

Final: Alongside his mother and a studio audience of Oprah fans, Aveion Jr, 13, told his father 'You don't get to leave me again!'

Cason is clear in his intentions to be a present father to the younger Aveion.

On his Twitter account, on which a photo of the former pro baller alongside Oprah Winfrey now serves as his profile picture, Cason describes himself thusly:

‘Florida made, but live in Dallas. God fearing and loving father. Im blessed and will always give 100% till da day my heart stop! In God Hands.’

Cason, who played for the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, Arizona Cardinals and Florida Tuskers, was a recognized running back and kick returner who played for an impressive 9 years.

Encouraging: Iyanla Vanzant acted as life coach as she instructed the younger Cason on how to tell his father exactly how he felt as part of an OWN series on Fatherless Sons and Daddyless Daughters

The emotional confrontation was part of a series of episodes of Oprah’s Lifeclass that focus on fatherless children.

The series continues with more Fatherless Sons on Sunday at 9pm on OWN, followed by two episodes on Daddyless Daughters on the July 14 and 21 episodes.

Trying: Cason was apart from his son for 10 years but now seems serious about breaking the fatherless son cycle that he too was born into

Retired: Cason was a running back and kick returner for the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, Arizona Cardinals and Florida Tuskers. His career lasted an impressive 9 years
