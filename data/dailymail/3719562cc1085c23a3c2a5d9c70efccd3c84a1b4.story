England’s limited-overs series against India was played in front of crowds largely supporting the away team. This was most evident at Edgbaston last Sunday in a T20 international, where around 90 per cent of the capacity crowd left disappointed as England secured a thrilling three-run victory.

Most of those waving Indian flags that day in Birmingham hold British passports, and have spent the majority of their life in the United Kingdom. Many were born on these shores, but still choose to follow the country of their family roots instead of their country of birth.

The England team over the years has contained many players with Asian heritage. This summer has seen the emergence of Moeen Ali - born in Birmingham and of Pakistani origin - as an international player. Before him the likes of Ravi Bopara, Monty Panesar and Samit Patel all broke into the England team as well.

The contribution of south Asians to cricket in England and Wales, from the top-level players, coaches, grassroots, youngsters and even recreational players is vast.

On October 7 at Lord’s, there will be an event to celebrate that contribution – the Asian Cricket Awards - open to people with south Asian heritage as well as those dedicated to increasing Asian participation in cricket on these shores. 

England star Ali said: ‘Asians throughout the UK make an enormous contribution to all aspects of the game. It’s great to see their input celebrated in such a positive way at the home of cricket.’

The awards, which are supported by the England and Wales Cricket Board, were founded by Baljit Rihal and Jas Jassal. 

The 11 categories cover all aspects of the game, from Player of the Year to Coach of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and Women in Cricket. 

Nominations for the event are now closed and a judging panel, featuring the likes of Mike Gatting, will decide the winners among a variety of categories on the night at the home of cricket.

Jassal said: ‘The awards are to recognise the contribution made by the British Asian community in cricket within the UK and it’s also about the integration and the role models who broke down barriers and reached the heights. We are celebrating all these contributions.

‘At the same time we are also giving a pat on the back to the governing bodies of English cricket for the work they have done in engaging, being inclusive and reaching out. In terms of participation from the south Asian community, it is very high and it goes from grass roots to the professional game.

‘I was quite stunned to see there was a population of seven or eight million south Asians in the UK yet in terms of the participation in cricket, south Asians represent 30 per cent.

‘British society has become so multicultural and Asians feel they have become part of this society and they see positives in it. There is so much there to be thankful for and rewarded.

‘Nasser Hussain, a second-generation Asian, built up a life in England and reached the highest achievements. He went from playing in grass roots to leading the side out on the field and that is a massive achievement.

‘If you look at football, there is nowhere near the level of engagement and success that cricket has. We need people like Nasser, Bopara, Ali and also women in cricket like Isa Guha, who have reached the heights and been successful to help set the standards for future generations to succeed.’

Guha, who is of Kolkata Bengali descent, was born in High Wycombe  and played for England’s women’s team for 10 years. Much like Asian participation in the game, women’s cricket has plenty to celebrate.

Guha said: ‘It’s important not to forget your roots but at the same time I appreciate that England has given me and my parents a lot of opportunity.

‘I will always support England because I was born and bred here and I played for England for 10 years.

‘Moeen Ali is a great role model and someone people can really look up to. Given the current climate in this country and attitudes towards Asians in this country, I think he paints a positive picture.’

In the women’s game, England’s side have recently turned professional – a move that looked a long way off a decade or so ago. In 2003, there were 90 clubs with girls’ sections in England and Wales. In 2014, there are over 600.

The ECB have also continued their investment in and support of the game, as have broadcasters such as Sky Sports and BBC. Let’s not forget, also, the success that Charlotte Edwards has led the team to – a World Cup win in 2009 and back-to-back Ashes victories over Australia.

Guha said: 'Women's cricket has come on leaps and bounds and really has just gone from strength to strength. The ongoing commitment from Sky and the BBC to raise the profile of the game has played an important part in the leading women’s cricketers becoming more recognisable figures.'

Guha will co-present the Asian Cricket Awards at Lord's on October 7. For more information visit www.asiancricketawards.co.uk
