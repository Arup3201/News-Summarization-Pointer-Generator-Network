When life becomes a struggle against a common enemy, it is hopefully a time when warring factions can unite and reconcile their differences.

Perhaps this is the reason for a startling new co-operative friendship between two factions of dolphins, who before have not even bothered to share a tuna snack between them.

The two bottlenose dolphin populations, living in the clear waters of Moreton Bay near Brisbane in Eastern Australia, have rarely interacted - but when fishing boats stopped using the bay, the dolphins got together to forage.

Tranquil coast: Moreton Bay, near Brisbane in Eastern Australia, is home to two tribes of dolphin - now merged into one group

One of the dolphin groups would feed almost entirely on the off-casts from trawler boats, while the other tribe would hunt fish for themselves.

In what was called 'the parting of the pods', the dolphins would never associate.

But with fishing reduced in the area by around 50 per cent, the dophins 're-engineered' their relationships.

Speaking to BBC Nature, Dr Ina Ansmann, marine vertebrate ecologist for the 
University of Queensland, said: 'There's never been really any experiments looking at social 
structure... where you can compare what it was like before and what it 
is like now.

Social behaviour: The dolphins became friends again in Moreton Bay, near Brisbane

'The dolphins had basically re-arranged their whole social system after trawling disappeared so they're now actually interacting again.

'When relying on natural food sources I guess it's more important for 
them to interact with others, or to learn from others, or to co-operate 
with others to get to these food sources.

'Presumably they're sharing information, co-operating and things like that.'

The scientists can tell individual dolphins apart from markings on their dorsal fin - usually scars or notches - and could follow individual dolphins as they moved between packs.

The behaviour of the divided animals was first noted in the 1990s, but now they hunt together - and perhaps one dolphin was the peace-broker, as he has is now 'fully integrated' with the other pack.
