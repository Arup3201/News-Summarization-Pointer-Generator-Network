Britain's biggest solar farm - large enough to power 11,000 homes - is to be built on the south coast after councillors approved the plans.

The 200 acre site will be positioned between Waterlooville, Hants, and Fareham, Hants.

The current largest solar farm in the UK is at Wymeswold Airfield in Leicestershire, Mids, at 150 acres.

A New 200 acre solar farm is to be built in Hampshire, and is 50 acres larger than the current record holder

The plans, submitted by Hampshire's Southwick Estate, will see the loss of agricultural land, which has been farmed for three generations.

But the scheme was given the go ahead by nine out of ten councillors on the Planning Development Control Committee at Winchester City Council.

Councillor Therese Evans, who was the dissenting voice, said: 'I fear it will set a precedent because they are taking up so much of a farm.

'I feel you have to be very careful about setting a precedent for a lot of fields.

'There are three which are currently being used successfully for agricultural farming, and have been for generations.

'Although I see the importance of renewable energy, I do still think it is important to retain agriculture as much as possible where it's viable.'

Pressure group the Campaign to Protect Rural England, also objected to the ambitious plans.

The land has been farmed by the Cutler family for three generations.

But current tenant farmer Neil Cutler said he supports the proposals and will work with the estate and solar farm providers to ensure its success.

The family will also be compensated for the loss.

A consultation was held in August this year and the majority of the responses were also positive.

Hampshire co-ordinator for Friends of the Earth Ray Cobbett welcomes the plans.

He said: 'It is another step on the long road to sustainable energy resources in south Hampshire and we welcome it.

'A calculation has to be made as to the best use of the land and that is down to the landowner and the local planning authority.'

Solar farm providers Hive Energy and Welborne Solar are supporting the plans.

Hive Energy chief executive Giles Redpath said: 'We are delighted to be working with Southwick Estate on this prestigious project.

'We are both committed to creating one of the UK's largest solar parks, which will be almost invisible from public areas, will support local ecology, will increase biodiversity and will deliver much-needed green electricity into the Portsmouth area for the next 25 years.'
