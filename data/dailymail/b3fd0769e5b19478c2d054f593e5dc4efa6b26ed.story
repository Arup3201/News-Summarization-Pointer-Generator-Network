A troupe of circus performers has been denied a business account after bank bosses branded their burlesque costumes - a 'moral problem' - even though they've got a no nudity policy.

Entertainer Joshua Morris started ‘Circus Uncertainty’ earlier this year and applied for a business bank account with Santander so he could get grants to fund work with terminally-ill children.

But he claims the banking giant denied his troupe an account because the showgirls’ burlesque-style outfits - a fringed bikini and stilts - were a 'moral problem'.

Santander bank has been accused of not letting a Bristol-based circus troupe open a bank account because they had a 'moral problem' with the outfits above, worn by female show girls

Joshua Morris, seen here balancing Dan Price against his body and with fellow troupe member Lucy Maraschino, wanted to open a bank account so the circus troupe could apply for grants

The performers are baffled by the decision as there is no nudity in the family-friendly act - which has featured at Glastonbury and the Harbourside Festival.

Mr Morris, an acrobat and juggler from Bristol, said: 'It has put all our plans on hold - we can’t move forward without it.'

The 20-year-old said the company needed the account so they could apply for grants to run a program that would bring the favourite cartoon characters of terminally ill children in to see them.

Mr Morris said his performers were far from X-rated.

He said: 'We never offer anything that could cause upset. There is no nudity or anything like that. Burlesque-style shows are pretty mainstream now.

'I have spoken to friends in the circus industry and other burlesque acts too, and none of them have ever had an issue with a bank.'

Mr Morris' problems began after he went into Bristol's Whiteladies Road branch of Santander and was questioned about his business, 'which seemed absolutely fine'.

A week later he claims he was told on the phone he couldn’t bank with Santander because staff had looked on the circus’ website and didn’t like the look of costumes worn during some acts.

Mr Morris said: 'She said we had been denied a bank account on the ground that we have a burlesque and a show girls act.

'She said someone higher up than her said because we sell burlesque and show girls acts we can’t have an account.

'She kept saying it was a ‘moral problem’ and that it was a ‘moral problem’ they can’t associate with the bank.

'We asked why that meant we couldn’t have an account and they didn’t offer an explanation, they just said no.'

The outfit in question is a blue fringed bikini covered in jewels, worn with a feather boa and a headdress by female show girls who greet audiences before performing a burlesque act.

Mr Morris said he couldn't understand why a bank was making a moral judgement, as his troupe were booked for a Lloyds party in September.

A Santander spokesman would not comment on the reason why Mr Morris' was not allowed to open an account, but said it was 'happy to review' his application following some 'clarification of the nature of the business'.

The spokesman said it was still in discussions with Mr Morris and hoped to reach a 'positive outcome' in the coming days.

He said: 'We are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience that out initial misunderstanding may have caused.'
