Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King is recovering well from proton therapy treatment in Prague, his parents have revealed.

Resting at the family's home in Spain, the child is now doing 'so much better' and is able to walk and talk after being confined to a hospital bed for months.

He was released from the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech Republic last month after undergoing a pioneering procedure to fight a tumour in his brain.

Today his father, Brett King said: 'He’s communicating with us, because he can hear us and he can see us. 

'He’s so much, so much better now and we’re really happy with him, the fact that he’s saying a few words as well,” Mrs King told ITV.

'He’s just improving each day.'

Ashya's case made headlines across the world when his parents sparked an international manhunt after removing him from a Southampton hospital without doctors' consent on August 28. 

Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly five-year-old in their care. 

After being traced to Malaga, Mr and Mrs King were arrested and put in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities.

Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days.

 Ashya was taken to Prague from Spain where his parents fled with him in August after becoming unsatisfied with the care he was receiving in the UK

The child arrived in Prague with his parents in September after they were dramatically released from jail 

In a dramatic turn of events his parents were released without charge and able to travel to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre. 

NHS England reversed its position and agreed to pay for the treatment. 

Ashya was released at the end of October after undergoing 30 rounds of therapy.  

Despite his promising recovery, Mr King said today he would not return to the UK with Ashya until he was assured nothing could be done to separate the family again. 

'If they ever try to take Ashya away that would kill us.

'Until things are established with what’s going to happen with Ashya, we feel too scared to return with Ashya,' the 51-year-old said. 

'There's a real fear that we have, not regarding us being arrested again but regarding Ashya. 

Ashya has undergone dozens of rounds of treatment at the centre in Prague (treatment room pictured) 

British police sparked an international manhunt after the child went missing with his parents on August 28. Pictured, a Hampshire Police press conference on the morning Ashya was taken from hospital 

'We don't really know what social services and the NHS have in store for us. They've never come forward and said "it's been a mistake, we'll never do it again. 

'We've heard many stories when families go back, they think it’s safe to go back, the social services get involved. 

'They take the child away. And then they give a gagging order for the parents so they can never explain their story to anyone.'
