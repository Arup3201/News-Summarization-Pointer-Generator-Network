It is no exaggeration to say Lee Westwood has two weeks to save his Ryder Cup career. Two more poor performances, at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio this week and the USPGA Championship that  follows, will surely bring to an end a proud record of continuous service dating back to his debut in 1997.

Westwood missing out would be a huge loss for Europe. As captain Paul McGinley has acknowledged, he was the unsung hero of the team’s successes over that period. Others may have holed the winning putt or garnered more points but the Englishman was the imposing backdrop. Even when not at his best, at Medinah last time, it was entirely typical he still contributed a point when it was most needed, against Matt Kuchar in the singles.

Why not pick him on past record then, as assistant captain Sam Torrance has urged? Because  sentiment has no place at the Ryder Cup and experience is a vicious double-edged sword.

Missing the cut? Lee Westwood is in danger of not being selected for the Ryder Cup for first time since his debut

Going through a bad spell: Lee Westwood has missed four halfway cuts in a row

Look at what happened to poor Jim Furyk last time. Furyk and Westwood are both in their early forties and have enjoyed similarly successful careers. In 2012, Furyk was going through a period where he couldn’t win to save his life — still is, alas, as his latest final-round collapse, at the Canadian Open on Sunday, demonstrated — but was picked by captain Davis Love as an act of faith.

When push came to shove, Furyk couldn’t deliver. Recent meltdowns trumped experience as he lost his crucial singles to Sergio Garcia despite being one up with two to play. Who would want to see  something horrible like that happen to Westwood, of all people?

Over the next fortnight, therefore, he has to earn the right to a wild card. We all know when playing well he’d walk into the team. Heck, even at 70 per cent, I’d pick him.

But the facts are Westwood hasn’t even played four rounds in an event since May having missed four  halfway cuts in a row, let alone  contend, and is well off the pace for one of the nine automatic spots.

No room for sentiment: Jim Furyk (L) was selected by the US for the 2012 Ryder Cup with disastrous results

Pecking order: Ian Poulter (L) and Graeme McDowell are better placed for wildcards than Lee Westwood

With the much better placed Graeme McDowell and Ian Poulter guaranteed wild cards if necessary, it means he is competing for the final pick against the likes of Stephen Gallacher, the man  currently 10th and who has finished 18-4-15 in his last three starts. Or Frankie Molinari, who is coming into form, or Miguel Angel Jimenez.

At least Westwood is assured of 72 holes this week, since there is no cut at Firestone — and he has shown once before that class is  permanent. In 2012, he completed an amazing comeback from 243rd in the world all the way to No 1.

How he could do with proving the old adage once more over the next fortnight.

Stinger! Ian Poulter was forced to visit hospital after a horse fly bite

Anyone who follows Ian Poulter’s entertaining Twitter feed must have reached the point on Sunday where they just went: what now?

The Englishman was on his way to hospital, the latest in a series of medical misadventures this season that have contributed to his disappointing year.

Hopefully, this latest ailment, a nasty horsefly bite that caused his arm to swell, won’t cause yet more disruption. He’s another player who could do with a big fortnight.

Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley gently took me to task a few months ago when I made light of him mentioning Bernhard Langer as a candidate for a playing spot at Gleneagles.

How could you pick a 57-year-old given the strength of the regular European Tour, was the gist of my argument.

Yet watching the German’s incredible 13-shot victory in the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl last week, you could envisage an enticing scenario.

Still got it! Bernard Langer scored a 13 shot victory at the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl

Two foursomes matches  alongside compatriot Martin Kaymer, while who would want to take him on in a singles match?

I still don’t think it will  happen. But McGinley is entirely right to give it due consideration.

‘I don’t care what Tiger does between now and the Ryder Cup. If Tiger wants to play, I would certainly choose him.’

 Nicklaus makes his views clear on the great Tiger Woods Gleneagles 
debate — and demonstrates why he was a poor Ryder Cup captain.

New lease of life: Rory McIlroy won The Open shortly after splitting with Caroline Wozniacki

Couple of birdies: Rory McIlroy has been linked with Nadia Forde (L)  and Sasha Gale (R)

Splitting up with fiancee Caroline Wozniacki in May, winning The Open in July and being photographed with two striking women either side of the tournament was enough for at least one columnist to conclude Rory McIlroy is the new Tiger Woods in every sense.

As lazy slurs go, this one would be hard to beat for indolence. McIlroy is 25 and has pronounced himself ‘very happy and very single’.

When Woods was philandering his way across America, he was married with two kids and continually spouting about the joys of being a family man.

Not difficult to spot the difference, is it?
