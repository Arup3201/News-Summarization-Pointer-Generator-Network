A year before two Vanderbilt football players were convicted in a 2013 gang rape, campus officials concluded there was a lack of evidence that 'nonconsensual sexual intercourse' had occurred.

The report from the Tennessee school's Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action and Disability Services Department led to the expulsion of Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Baty and two other players.

However, Vanderbilt has refused to release its on-campus findings, leading some to wonder if the panel determined the players had, in fact, raped an unconscious female student.

According to the Tennessean, the school's report concluded only that Vandenburg was an 'accomplice' in violating the woman's privacy.

Guilty: A jury found Brandon Vandenburg, pictured left on Tuesday, and Cory Batey, pictured right on Monday, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. A year before, Vanderbilt's internal review came to a different conclusion

Video footage taken during the June 2013 incident shows football players carrying an unconscious woman down a hallway and laughing as they photograph her and remove articles of her clothing.

The school is now the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for its handling of sexual violence allegations. 

While that investigation is ongoing, Vandenburg and Baty--both 21--face a possible decades-long jail sentence after they were found guilty last week of multiple counts of sexual assault.

The two remaining defendants alleged to have joined Batey and Vandenburg in the dorm room attack, former players Jaborian McKenzie and Brandon Banks, probably helped themselves by cooperating with authorities, but their consequences loom much larger now that their former teammates have been found guilty.

University officials, experts on sex crimes and survivors of sexual assault at Vanderbilt and all over the country hope the verdict's loudest signal goes out to women suffering in silence - telling them that justice is possible without destroying their own lives in the process.

Most college sex assaults don't turn out this way. A recent Justice Department study found that 80 percent of campus rapes went unreported between 1995 and 2013, compared to 67 percent in the general population. 

An attorney for one of the ex-Vanderbilt University football players convicted of raping an unconscious fellow student says he will ask that a mistrial be declared after learning that a jury member was a rape victim.

Fletcher Long says the juror was asked during jury selection about past experience with the criminal justice system, as either a victim or defendant. Long says the juror failed to disclose the rape.

Long said the person 'lied to get on the jury' and 'got on with an agenda.'

The juror's attorney, Sunny Eaton, said her client did not make misrepresentations. Eaton said the juror's past had 'no impact whatsoever' on decision-making at trial.

The Associated Press does not generally identify sexual-assault victims.

A spokeswoman for prosecutors said they do not believe the issue will overturn the verdict.

Easy decision: Jurors (from left), Dr Deirdre Young, Todd Easter and Dr. Corbi Milligan said they knew they had to convict Vandenburg and Batey when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack

The victim said she hopes her experience will encourage others to discuss how to end campus rapes.

'I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone,' she said in a statement read by one of the prosecutors. 'You are not to blame.'

In this case, the evidence was overwhelming. Jurors saw university surveillance video and the players' own graphic cellphone images that put them at the scene. Vandenburg could be heard laughing and encouraging the attack on video he shared while it was happening.

Testimony showed that he passed out condoms during the June 23, 2013 attack.

Charging all four players with rape even though not all of them engaged in the act itself sends a strong message about holding people accountable, said Jane Stapleton, a University of New Hampshire professor who runs bystander intervention programs at campuses. Only two players were accused of raping the student, but all four were charged with it because prosecutors held them criminally responsible based on their actions that night.

Vandenburg gets a hug from attorney Albert Perez Jr. after being found guilty. The 21-year-old was called an 'accomplice' in violating the rape victim's privacy in an internal investigation from jsut after the June 2013 incident

'The jury has spoken. Now it is up to the court to impose an appropriate sentence on the defendants. The conduct revealed by the evidence at trial was profoundly disturbing and utterly unacceptable.

'Our heart goes out to the victim. Her testimony was forceful and brave. She has received our care and support.

'Many months ago Vanderbilt found both defendants responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy, and we quickly discharged both of them from the football team and subsequently expelled them from the university. We are confident we acted appropriately.

'Since Vanderbilt first reported the incident to the Nashville police, we have given our full cooperation to law enforcement, including the District Attorney's office. We will continue to do so.

'The safety and security of our students is Vanderbilt's top priority. Sexual violence will never be tolerated. Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.'

The trial provided a rare opportunity to see what rape really looks like, experts on sexual violence said.

'There's no shortage of rape and sexual assault cases being put out in the media, but very rarely do we hear all the graphic details of a sexual assault,' said Rachel Freeman, vice president of programs at the Sexual Abuse Center of Nashville.

And unlike so many other rape cases, this wasn't a matter of 'he-said/she-said.' The video made it obvious the woman was unconscious and totally incapable of consenting, so it was impossible to suggest that she was somehow to blame, Freeman said.

The woman testified that the last thing she remembered was Vandenburg giving her drinks at a Nashville nightspot - and that she woke up the next morning in his dorm room, feeling sick and injured. To this day, she has no memory of the attack, she told jurors.

Rumors swirled around campus, but she didn't learn what had happened until well after police came to her. The players had tried to cover it up by erasing the images. Testimony showed at least five other Vanderbilt athletes saw her in distress and did not report it.

Only when Vanderbilt officials stumbled across closed-circuit TV showing players carrying an unconscious woman through the dormitory and into the room did they begin asking questions and summon the police, who recovered the digital evidence that made all the difference in court.

Seeing the case through wasn't easy. The woman cried quietly throughout the trial, and doubled over and appeared to vomit at one point when Batey was testifying.

But The Associated Press and other news organizations preserved her privacy, and she endured the proceedings as a Vanderbilt graduate. The attack didn't keep her from finishing her degree, and she's now pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience at an out-of-state university.

That a victim of gang rape managed to keep her academic career on track is a real achievement, advocates say, something Vanderbilt officials hope students everywhere will consider.

Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor of academic affairs, called the victim's response 'forceful and brave,' and said sexual violence will never be tolerated at the school.

'Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.'

'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case. All four men were expelled from Vanderbilt but never accused of rape by the university

'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. The hard work of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and victims' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible.

'I want to especially thank detective Jason Mayo, Sgt. Mike Shreeve, Detective Chad Gish, Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman, Assistant District Attorneys Jan Norman and Roger Moore and victims' advocates Wanda Swan, Lt. Rochelle Barrios and Teresa Shearon. You are my heroes and I am so proud of and grateful for each of you.

'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.'
