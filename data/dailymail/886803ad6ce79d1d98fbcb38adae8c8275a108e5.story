In recent months passengers have opened emergency exits moments before take-off, had fist fights over crying babies and even the heir to Korean Air has been jailed for throwing a tantrum after her nuts were served in the wrong way.

But apparently it has been the best year ever for passengers behaving themselves on planes. 

According to new figures released from the Federal Aviation Administration, passengers have finally been cowed into submission - in the US at least.

Sitting comfortably? Probably not, but it appears that passengers have been cowed into submission as the number of 'unruly passengers incidents' were the lowest since records began in 2014

In its latest report, the number of 'unruly passenger incidents' in 2014 was the lowest since 1995 when the agency began collating the information.

The FFA figures show that flight crews reported 121 unruly passenger to the authorities last year, significantly less that in previous years. 

Unacceptable behaviour includes passengers assaulting, threatening or intimidating airline crew, with reporting incidents at the discretion of crew members. 

Harsh penalties - up to $25,000, or £16,000 - and even criminal charges can be doled out to the worst offenders, although according to an investigation by USA Today, only 1 in 6 complaints has resulted in a fine between 2009 and 2013.

The findings may come as a surprise to some frequent travellers, however. There was concern last year that air rage was actually on the rise as tightly-packed airplanes had led some passengers to take matters into their own hands. 

Passengers conditions may not be improving, but the number of passenger incidents was down in 2014

While most of us can only dream of turning left as you enter an aircraft, cramped conditions and food you wouldn't even serve your dog has become standard fare for the rest of us back in zoo class

Incidents involving the so-called 'Knee Defender' - a device that clips onto the seat in front of you to prevent the chair from reclining - hit the headlines last August after a United Airlines flight was diverted due to a passenger scuffle involving the device.

Reasons for the overall decline in passenger incidents may not be entirely clear cut however. The spike in reported passenger incidents in 2001 followed a 'zero tolerance' approach to bad behaviour, and the recent decline may be down to airlines denying boarding to unruly travelers and nipping potential problem passengers in the bud.
