The anguished family of a soldier who was killed by his comrade in a vicious attack at their barracks after a late-night drinking session have branded his murderer 'dishonourable and cowardly', after he was sentenced to life in prison. 

Afghan veteran Corporal Geoffrey McNeill, 32, was murdered by 23-year-old Lance Corporal Richard Farrell at Clive Barracks, Tern Hill, Shropshire, in March.

Farrell had always denied killing his fellow member of the Royal Irish Regiment but was found guilty by a jury after a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

After  Farrell was sentenced to life in jail, the victim's family said the sentence was 'not comparable' to the 'immeasurable, unforgettable and indefinite' devastation caused by Corporal McNeill's brutal murder.

In a statement, they said: 'While we are pleased that justice through the courts has prevailed, there remains a void in our lives that will never be filled.

'The sentence received by Richard Farrell is not comparable to the sentence carried by those who knew and loved Geoff, for which there is no limit.

'The actions of Richard Farrell have significantly impacted on Geoff's family and friends, including his colleagues within the Army.

'The devastation caused is immeasurable, unforgettable and indefinite.'

The family, who sat throughout the proceedings, added that Cpl McNeill was a man of 'ambition, drive and potential', whose life had been stolen along with an 'opportunity to have children and settle down'.

'We would like Geoff to be remembered for the legend that he was and not for the dishonourable, cowardly and brutal way in which he was taken from us all,' they added. 

Corporal McNeill was found dead in his room in March this year, after Farrell raised the alarm.

The pair had been out drinking in Market Drayton the night before and Corporal McNeill had punched Farrell while they were in a pub.

Farrell had told jurors how he stumbled upon McNeill's battered body the next morning. But the court heard there had been three-and-a-half hours earlier that morning where Farrell's movements could not be accounted for.

Jurors had been told how Corporal McNeill's neck was broken in three places during the brutal attack. He was also punched in the head, stomach and genitals. 

Sentencing, Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Farrell he had carried out a 'very severe assault' on Cpl McNeill in his room. 

The judge said: 'That is not however how you killed Mr McNeill. You killed him by sustained pressure to his neck with either a ligature or manually, like some form of arm hold.'

In the course of the strangulation, the judge added, Cpl McNeill had dug his fingernails so hard into his own neck in a bid to break whatever hold was on him, it had left marks.

Judge Inman added he was satisfied there had been 'premeditation' in the attack, and that having killed Cpl McNeill, Farrell then 'left his body'. 

The attack took place at the Royal Irish Regiment's Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire, in March

The family of Lance Corporal McNeill, pictured outside court, have said they want him to be remembered for his 'drive, ambition and potential' rather than the brutal way in which he was killed

'I am satisfied that there is no sensible possibility you went looking for Mr McNeill for purely peaceful reasons and only reacted with such violence as a result of something that passed between you.' 

Despite Farrell's denial, the jury at Birmingham Crown Court agreed with the prosecution case that the 23-year-old soldier, from Dublin, had murdered Cpl McNeill by 'inflicting a series of heavy blows' and breaking the older man's neck in three places.

He was ordered to serve a minimum 15 years behind bars. 

Farrell had claimed he remembered nothing of the night's events, having drunk at least a litre of Disaronno liqueur. 

The court previously heard there was 'no history of ill-feeling or animosity' between Corporal McNeill and and Farrell, who served in a different company in the regiment.

During the trial, jurors were told how Farrell went alone to Corporal McNeill's room at about 9.15am on March 8 this year and, apparently then finding him dead, raised the alarm.

Talking about the night before, Christopher Hotten QC described an incident in the town's Clive and Coffyne pub, where an 'annoyed' Farrell complained some soldiers were 'acting "like maggots".'

Later that night, as CCTV from inside the nearby Sandbank Vaults pub showed, Cpl McNeill floored Farrell with a right hook, cutting his own knuckle and the young lance corporal's lip in the process.

Witnesses later told how Cpl McNeill had claimed the younger man was 'trapping off' before he landed the punch. Farrell would also later tell colleagues he had been 'gobbing off' to the corporal, said Mr Hotten.

The prosecutor said that punch 'could provide an explanation for a later attack carried out by Mr Farrell, as revenge for what had happened'.

After the fracas, both men left separately, returning to barracks within minutes of each other at about 3am.

Farrell's movements could not be accounted for between his arrival back at base, and 6.30am, when he was discovered asleep on the floor of the guard room.

The last time Corporal McNeill was seen, he was sitting outside the accommodation block housing his third-floor room on the base just after returning to the barracks.

Between 4am and 4.30am that morning, a soldier whose room was opposite Cpl McNeill's thought he heard 'bumping noises' and a male voice say '"Geoff - calm down", two or three times,' said Mr Hotten.

That soldier got out of bed but only to lock his door from the inside, and did not look out onto the adjoining corridor to see what was happening.

Mr Hotten said Farrell awoke in the base's guardroom, then went back to his room to shower, washing his clothes at the barracks' laundry.

He asked one soldier '"where's McNasty's room?" - in reference to Cpl McNeill, saying he couldn't remember anything, and wanted to apologise,' added the prosecutor.

Farrell got to Cpl McNeill's room at about 9.15am, and said he found the other man lying on the floor in just his underpants.

'According to Farrell he made vigorous attempts at resuscitation, and that would have led to a significant transfer of DNA,' said Mr Hotten.

Farrell would later tell police he squeezed Cpl McNeill's testicles 'to see if he was conscious, as part of Army training he had received', he added.  

Describing Cpl McNeill, from Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, the judge said it was clear he was 'obviously a hugely well-liked and respected soldier' and 'a loved and trusted comrade' much missed by his family.

Mr Inman said he had read 'very moving statements' from Cpl McNeill's family.

'As a family, it will clearly take a very long time for them to come to terms with Mr McNeill's death and the circumstances of it,' he added.

'No one reading their statements could remain unmoved.'
