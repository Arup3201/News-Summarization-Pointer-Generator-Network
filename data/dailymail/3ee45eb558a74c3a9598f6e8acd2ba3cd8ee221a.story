Tragic: Donations to Susan Taylor's chosen charities have reached £50,000 since she died trying to swim the English Channel

The distraught husband of  charity swimmer Susan Taylor last night spoke of his heartbreak after watching his wife collapse and die as she attempted to swim the Channel.

Speaking in Boulogne, where his wife of six years was airlifted to hospital on Sunday, Stephen Taylor, 43, said he was ‘proud to have been part of his beautiful wife’s life’ and was ‘devastated by her loss’.

His comments came as donations to Mrs Taylor’s charity pages for terminally ill children and diabetes research soared to over £61,000.

The 34-year-old suffered a  cardiac arrest just one mile from France as she pursued her dream of swimming the Channel.

Her husband said in a statement: ‘Susan was a determined, strong and dedicated person who gave her everything to whatever she did.

'She would have been so proud of the massive response and support for her chosen charities, Diabetes UK and Rainbows children’s hospice.’

It emerged that Mrs Taylor, of Barwell,

Leicestershire, had vomited several times due to fatigue and a reaction from the salt water.

She was dragged from the water by her support team but was declared dead on arrival at Boulogne hospital.

Thousands of people have since donated money to the charities, Rainbows Hospice and Diabetes UK, Mrs Taylor was raising money for.

The money was boosted when comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel in 2006 - tweeted the links to the charities to his 1.2million followers.

He is believed to have pledged £1,000 after a donation was made under the name of the Little Britain star with the message 'Sending all my love to Susan's family and friends'.

Walliams tweeted later: 'Despite the shock & sadness, it's good to see heroic Susan Taylor's charity total rising. Please give what you can...'

The star also tweeted a link to Mrs Taylor's Facebook page Create A Ripple Channel Swim, writing: 'Susan Taylor's channel swim attempt very sadly ended in tragedy. This is her charity page if you want to donate...'

Mrs Taylor had reportedly written in a blog post her ambition to follow in Walliams' footsteps by swimming the Channel.

'I've had an ambition to follow in comedian David Walliams's strokes and swim the Channel since I was a child,' she wrote.

Her mother, Joyce 
Wright, said the family had been anxious about the swim, despite her 
being in peak physical condition.

And she said her 40-year-old son David
felt guilty about being unable to save his sister’s life on the boat.

‘Our son is a paramedic so he’d taken kit with him. He’s devastated. 
He’s blaming himself,’ added the 68-year-old.

‘But he did everything he 
could. He just needs to have a big cuddle when he gets back.

Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months 
preparing for her arduous challenge in one of the busiest shipping lanes
in the world.

She even quit her job as an accountant to train full 
time.

Prepared: Mrs Taylor's progress team posted this picture during her swim, writing: 'Easy way versus the hard way!!!!! Susan definitely deserves the easy way next time!!! She's doing fab :)'

She set off from Dover at 1am on 
Sunday covered in goose fat and with her brother and her husband, 
43-year-old electrician Stephen, in the support boat.

Friends and family had watched her progress online through a link to a GPS device that tracked her for 16 hours and 20 miles.

But they became concerned when they 
noticed her position marker stopped for several minutes before racing 
off in the direction of Boulogne.

Her brother then posted the message: 
‘Whilst attempting to swim the English Channel yesterday my sister, 
Susan, collapsed suddenly in the water.

‘She was immediately recovered from 
the water and treated on the support boat.

'She was then airlifted by 
helicopter to a hospital in Boulogne. Susan tragically passed away.’

Huart Alexandre, 22, a French 
lifeguard who responded to the emergency call, said: ‘We performed CPR 
for 45 minutes but she still wasn’t breathing.

‘Her husband had gone below the deck because he couldn’t bear to watch what was happening. He wanted to be alone.’

Mr Wright urged donors to carry on 
giving to his sister’s fundraising page.

Last night, Mr Taylor, who helped his wife train in lakes near their 
home in Barwell, Leicestershire, was in France as preparations were made
to carry out a post-mortem to determine the cause of death.

Mrs Wright said: ‘Susan was struggling with the currents and the tide.

'She was obviously tired. She collapsed in the water.

‘The hardest bit is the last bit and 
she knows that. She was about two kilometres from France and was 
battling against the tide.

'We know Susan wouldn’t have got out of the 
water, she wouldn’t give up.’

An online map tracking Ms Taylor's progress appeared to show that her support boat had suddenly sped up and sailed in a different direction towards land

Susan's father Arthur, 68, added: ‘I’m 
devastated. I’ve lost the best person in the world. She was just 
wonderful.’

Her parents said she had swum a relay in Windermere four months ago and a Channel relay last year in training.

On an online blog, Mrs Taylor had 
written: ‘I’ve had an ambition to follow in comedian David Walliams’s 
strokes and swim the Channel since I was a child.

‘This is a dream I have cherished since I was a club swimmer, growing up in Barwell.’

Swimming coach Paul Farrier, who had known Mrs Taylor since she was a child, praised her enthusiasm and said she always had a smile on her face.

In a press conference, part of which was broadcast by ITV News, he said: 'As I watched her on Sunday morning as she set off on her journey, I saw what I knew back 30 years ago. I was going to help her achieve her amazing goal that she had set out on two years ago.

'Her commitment to her training meant that she had put on hold her career as an accountant so that she could give, because this was what Susan was really about.

'She was a natural giver. So when Susan approached me two years ago and asked me if I would be so kind as to help her on her journey - she told me that she was swimming for charity, the Rainbows Hospice charity based in Loughborough, my home town. Having taught children with severe learning difficulties myself for a short time, the answer was a no-brainer.

'She then added Diabetes UK - again as a Type 2 diabetic myself, no brainer. On top of this, she endlessly worked as an ambassador for Rainbows Hospice charity.'

France does not allow cross-Channel 
swims to start from its own side because of the dangers posed by 
shipping, as well as dangerous currents and changing weather conditions.

Mrs Taylor is the eighth swimmer to 
die since Captain Matthew Webb made the first unassisted swim across the
Strait of Dover in 1875.

The last fatality was 45-year-old Paraic Casey, of Cork, Ireland, who died last July.

Like Mrs Taylor, he became ill a mile from the French coast.
