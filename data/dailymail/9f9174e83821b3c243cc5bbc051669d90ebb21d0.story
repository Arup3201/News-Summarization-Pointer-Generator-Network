Villagers built a great wall of cash in China after their cooperative stacked up huge profits.

The giant wads worth 13 million yuan (Â£1.3million) in total were laid out in a 2m tall 'money wall' at Jianshe village in the Lianshan municipality, in south-west China's Sichuan province.

Several residents even slept on the notes overnight to guard them from thieves before the end of year bonuses were distributed the following day.

Wall of money: Villagers waiting before the cash for their year-end bonus is distributed

One of guards said: 'It is not comfortable at all to sleep on cash,' adding that he was too worried to fall asleep.

Villager Jin Ou, who received around 300,000 yuan, said: 'It took me so long to count the money that I almost lost strength and feeling in my hands.'

Yang Huai, who received 200,000 yuan, said it had been a custom in the village since 2010 to distribute the bonus in cash before the Chinese New Year.

Some 340 out of a total number of 483 households are the shareholders of a rural cooperative established that year, which profits from pig farms, cherry orchards, and its investment in four small scale hydropower plants in Sichuan, said a village official surnamed Zhu.

The villagers are guaranteed an annual bonus, despite villagers not being directly involved in the cooperative's daily operations.

After the report was circulated online, many microbloggers asked how they could squeeze into the rural cooperative.

'I should have stayed at home farming instead of working [in a city],' wrote a microblogger under the name Mark.

Village chief Jin Hongyuan suggested marrying the villagers, adding that one had to become a resident before he or she could buy a share.
