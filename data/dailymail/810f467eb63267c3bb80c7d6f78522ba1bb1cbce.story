Emmanuel Adebayor could feature when Spurs host Burnley on Saturday, a match manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted was a ‘must-win,’ for his side.

The striker returned to training after being granted a week leave for ‘personal reasons’ to travel back to Ghana.

He has not featured for his club since November 9th when they were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane. The Togo international later directed his ire at home fans, claiming home fans’ booing was damaging players’ confidence.

Pochettino was coy about whether Adebayor would play a part in the Burnley match after he missed the 4-0 League Cup victory over Newcastle on Wednesday. 

‘Adebayor is available and after we will see if I pick him or not,’ said Pochettino, ‘I am happy with Ade and all the players, maybe he’s in the squad or maybe not. It is my decision of how we play tomorrow and which players to pick.

‘He’s getting better, maybe not 100 per cent. He needs training and to improve his physical condition but he’s getting better.’

Spurs, who have lost four times in front of their home fans this season, will be strong favourites to overcome Burnley, who are hovering just above the relegation zone.

Pochettino said confidence levels are high after the victory over Newcastle and a Premier League win at Swansea last Sunday. But Sean Dyche’s side are in a rich vein of form, too, having taken 11 points from a possible 18 in their last six games.

‘Burnley are a very consistent and physical team,’ said Pochettino, ‘They have a lot of good players. Every game need to win more. In our mind, we have to get the three points and keep the performance on Wednesday in our heads.

‘There’s a very good spirit and mood after Newcastle victory. I feel the relationship between the players and supporters is good. It’s important to create this relationship between supporters and the team. After that only good and positive things come.’

Pochettino said he will still opt to pick Nabil Bentaleb despite the fact the midfielder soon depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts of January 17, with Algeria.

‘We know that Bentaleb has to go to the African Cup of Nations but I believe he’s the best player to play tomorrow,’ said Pochettino, ‘I don’t think about afterwards.’

Algeria and Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb will be absent during the African Cup of Nations next month
