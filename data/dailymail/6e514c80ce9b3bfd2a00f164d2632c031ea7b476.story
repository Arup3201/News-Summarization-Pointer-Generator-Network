You might have expected Take That’s fans to have acted their age.

In the 16 years since the fab five had last performed live together, they’d all grown up a bit...hadn’t they?

But when the band reunited for its sell-out Progress tour, it seemed the thirty and forty-something fans cramming into their concerts weren’t so mature after all.

In classic teenage style, they became tired, emotional ... and very, very drunk.

Patience: Take That fans desperate to see their idols queue for concert tickets

Official figures released yesterday show that paramedics had to deal with 792 medical cases – most alcohol or heat related – during the eight summer nights the band played at City of Manchester Stadium.

It was already known that more than 100 women, most in their 30s and 40s, had to be treated in hospital after drinking too much after the concerts in 2011.

The volume of fans who had overdone it resulted in a 10 per cent increase on average admissions to Manchester Royal Infirmary, severely stretching hospital resources, doctors said at the time.About 160 extra patients had to be treated on the concert dates –  or 27 per day.

The new figures, which follow a Freedom of Information request, reveal for the first time the full extent of the mayhem. They also show police dealt with 75 incidents and made 30 arrests.

One fan was assaulted and suffered a fit on the pitch. But after being released from hospital, the concert-goer refused to press charges against those arrested.

In a separate incident, a large-scale police operation began after a ‘hand’ was spotted in the canal.

Thankfully it turned out to be a glove.

The City of Manchester Stadium, also known as the Etihad Stadium, is the home ground of Manchester City Football Club.

It was sold out for Take That’s eight-night run in which they performed to nearly 500,000 fans.

At the time, the Mail reported how disappointed fans, who had paid more than £50 a ticket, accused stewards of failing to tackle concert-goers who had clearly been drinking all day.

Fan Vanessa Buck said her night was ruined by a bunch of drunk and abusive women sitting behind her. 

‘I regularly enjoy nights out in city centre bars and this was worse than anything I’ve ever seen in Manchester or Liverpool on a busy Saturday night,’ she said.

Steward Adele Wilkinson said: ‘The amount of women we have found slumped on the concourse and in the toilets is unbelievable  – absolutely trolleyed, being sick, one wandering around the toilet with no pants on, fighting with friends.’

Police had asked licensed premises around the ground not to sell alcohol to concert-goers to prevent trouble but it was still on sale inside the ground.  Among drinks at bars were £18 full-size plastic bottles of Chardonnay.

The new details come from a meeting of the Safety Advisory Group, made up of club officials, police, and health and council staff.

A staggering 1.76million tickets were sold for Take That’s 27 British shows, eight of which were staged at Wembley.

They were their first concerts since Robbie Williams rejoined after splitting from Take That bandmates Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald in 1995.
