Chris Christie’s George Washington Bridge scandal was front and center on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as the opening sketch poked fun at the scandal-plagued New Jersey Governor.

The show kicked off with a skit showing Gov Christie taking questions as a guest on CNN’s ‘Piers Morgan Live.’ It also featured the debut of Sasheer Zamata, the show's first-ever female African-American cast member.

When asked if he was aware of the scandal, Gov Christie (played by Bobby Moynihan) wisecracked about being too busy.

‘I’m a busy man Piers, I got budgets to balance, teachers to yell at, I got to work out five times a year… instead of keeping track of every friggin’ idiot’ he said.

The governor then turned the tables on the chat show host asking how long his commute is.

When told it is only 15 minutes, Gov Christie said ‘that’s a nice commute, it would be a real shame if something were to happen to it.’

The host asked if he was threatening him and Mr Christie replied ‘I don’t know, am I? While holding a sign that said ‘I AM.’

Gov Christie was later further lampooned during the Weekend Update skit when host Seth Myers started off while showing a picture of him saying 'if you cross this guy, you can't cross this guy' as a picture of the George Washington Bridge showed up on-screen.

Auto correct: Host/musical guest Drake played Alex Rodriguez and blamed his iPhone for his problems

Auto correct: The player said auto-correct changed a harmless message to the one above

The host, played by Taran Killam, then 
brought on shamed Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, played by rapper
 Drake, who said he suing everything in his path.

‘My attorney and I are currently suing Major League Baseball for gross misconduct, suing the union for failing to trick Major League Baseball and I’m also suing steroids for being inside me,’ the ball player said.

He then blamed auto correct for changing texts about innocuous topics to messages about steroids before saying he’s suing his iPhone. Blackberry messages were the crux of the league's case against the ball player.

Singer Justin Bieber, played by Kate McKinnon, came on last and claimed it was Canadian tradition to throw eggs at people’s homes.

Her first skit: Sasheer Zamata's first skit saw her dancing as Rihanna in a fictionalized episode of hit 90's show 'Blossom'

Weekend Update also mocked actress Jacqueline Bisset’s long walk to the stage at the Golden Globes earlier this week.

After announcing that she was to appear on the segment, Ms Bisset was seen in the top level of the stands hugging all the audience members while hosts Seth Myers and Cecily Strong pleaded with her to come down.

They eventually gave up and periodically checked in on her until she finally made her way to the stage.

Walk off music began playing immediately after asking her what it was like to finally win a Golden Globe.

Mazel tov!: Ms Zamata;s first actual line came in her second skit

A subsequent skit saw the first appearance of Sasheer Zamata, the show’s first African-American woman cast member.

She did not say anything in her first appearance, instead just dancing while playing Rihanna in a fictionalized version of the 90s television show ‘Blossom.’

Her first line came in her second skit, ‘mazel tov.’

Twitter response to her performance was almost uniformly positive.

'Sasheer Zamata is in every sketch, love her!!,' tweeted one person.

'It's fair to say Sasheer Zamata is nobody's token hire. If SNL couldn't find her before, they must not have been looking that hard,' tweeted another.

Reponse to host, and musical guest, Drake's acting was almost all positive as well, with many people saying it was the best episode of the show in a while.

'Drake is taking over the entire night and this is suppose to be Sasheer Zamata's debut as a new #SNL cast member,' one person tweeted.
