Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe.

The main focus on the continent on Tuesday is on the return of the Champions League, with Barcelona and Real Madrid unsurprisingly capturing the headlines in Spain.

Lionel Messi is emblazoned across the front page of Mundo Deportivo as he goes in search of Raul's all-time Champions League scoring record as Barca face APOEL Nicosia.

The Argentinian has scored 67 goals in Europe's premier competition - one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and three fewer than Raul.

Sport leads with the story that Barca boss Luis Enrique has described Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10' who can inspire the Catalans to glory this season.

In Marca, however, the focus is on Real Madrid as they aim to defend their Champions League crown.

Marca claim Real face a 'triple test' to retain the trophy and Sport labels Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10'

According to the newspaper they face a 'triple test' of aiming to become the first side to retain the trophy in the Champions League era, to correct their poor start to the season with a victory over Basle and to convert the booing of Iker Casillas into an 'ovation'.

AS, meanwhile, have Ronaldo as their top story with the forward 'pulling the wagon' at the Bernabeu. His 17 goals last season gives the holders hope they can recover from their current slump.

Both Milan clubs are given prominence on the front of La Gazetta dello Sport in Italy as they continue their 'revival'. Between Inter (a 7-0 win over Sassuolo) and AC (a narrow 5-4 victory over Parma), 12 goals were scored over the weekend and optimism is returning to the fashion capital of Italy. Neither side will be in the Champions League, however, as Inter only reached the Europa League and AC did not even qualify for Europe.

But in both Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are the focus.

The Italian champions endured a dreadful campaign last year and Corriere says Juve must 'try again' to progress further, while Tuttosport explains that they 'need to perform' after the 'delusion' of the previous season.

Finally, in France, L'Equipe labels the return of Europe's premier competition as 'The League of Extraordinary Footballers.'

Juve's Paul Pogba, Paris Saint-Germain's David Luiz, Monaco's Dimitar Berbatov, Barca's Luis Suarez, Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone - as well as Ronaldo and Messi - all feature on the French paper's front cover.
