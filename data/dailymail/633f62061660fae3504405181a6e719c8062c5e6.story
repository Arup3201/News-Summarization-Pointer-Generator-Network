A sensational 82nd-minute strike from Ashley Smith-Brown snatched victory for England's U19s over Denmark in their UEFA elite qualifying opener in Bayeux on Thursday.

England came from behind twice in the first half as Marcus Ingvartsen and Robert Skov's goals were cancelled out first by captain Izzy Brown and Demarai Gray as they went to the break 2-2.

They couldn't be separated until Manchester City defender Smith-Brown pulled the trigger from outside the box and his left-footed shot thundered in off the underside of the cross bar.

Feverish closing stages followed at the Henry Jeanne Stadium as England fought to keep their lead with a player from either side sent off by the Italian referee Marco Guida.

Jeppe Hansen went first for Denmark a minute after the final goal for an unseemly tackle on Colkett before Tottenham's Harry Winks received a second yellow card in the 87th minute.

Ingvartsen's opener came from a long throw just six minutes in with the move immediately after Birmingham's Demarai Gray almost put England ahead after a cross from Charlie Colkett.

They levelled when Ruben Loftus-Cheek found captain and fellow Chelsea star Izzy Brown, who despite having plenty of work to do evaded two defenders and beat keeper Daniel Iversen.

Despite momentum going England's way and a number of chances going begging, Denmark were in the lead again in the 44th minute as Skov burst into the box and beat Angus Gunn for 2-1.

In the same minute though Sean O’Driscoll’s side were back on terms as Gray flicked-on Roberts free-kick from the edge of the box with the help of a possible deflection.  

Neither side took the second half as their own with only half chances coming their way until Smith-Brown's goal came from seemingly nothing more than the Danish defence underestimating his ability from range and giving him too much space. 

England will play Azerbaijan in their second group match on Saturday.
