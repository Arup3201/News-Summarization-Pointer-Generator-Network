As he posed for a holiday snap on the beach, six-year-old Nick Wheeler paid no attention to the little girl making sandcastles a few yards away.

It was only when he showed his fiancee Aimee Maiden the photograph 20 years later that she pointed at the five-year-old in a swimsuit and shrieked in astonishment: ‘That’s me!’

The pair lived hundreds of miles apart when the picture was taken in 1994, yet fate determined that they would meet and fall in love at sixth form college, 11 years later.

Nick Wheeler (circled right) was on holiday in Mousehole, Cornwall, where his now wife Aimee (circled left) was brought up. They had no idea they had first met when they were five and six until they found the picture

Teacher Miss Maiden grew up in the seaside village of Mousehole in Cornwall, while Mr Wheeler lived in Kent but was on a family holiday there. 

The pair spent the day building sandcastles just a few yards apart but their two families were strangers and never spoke.

Mr Wheeler, a soldier, moved to Cornwall a year later but it wasn’t until they were to the same sixth form college in Truro that they finally met.

It was only when they got engaged last year that they decided to leaf through old holiday photographs at Mr Wheeler’s grandparent’s house.

As they came across the shot of Mr Wheeler building a boat in the sand with his sister and cousin Miss Maiden suddenly recognised herself as one of the young girl’s in the background.

The couple married on Saturday and will be heading to Florida for their honeymoon

She said: ‘The photo was taken by Nick’s grandad. Nick is sitting front right in the boat with his sister and two cousins and his family, his mum, uncle and nan are to the right and behind them.

‘To the left and behind his cousin I’m in the blue swimsuit with my mum, dad and sister.

‘What makes it even more significant was that, although I was brought up in Mousehole, Nick and his family didn’t even live in Cornwall at the time.

‘He and his family were down on holiday from Kent and didn’t move down permanently to Newlyn until a year later.’

After their college years Mr Wheeler joined the army while Miss Maiden trained as a teacher.

They moved in together three years ago and got engaged last year, where they hosted a party and showed off the photo to friends and family.

The couple married on Saturday at Gulval Church in Mousehole, 20 years after the photo was taken and just a minute’s walk from the same spot.

They are heading to Florida for their honeymoon and plan to frame the treasured picture as soon as they get back.

Miss Maiden added: ‘It’s probably something we should do. The honeymoon is a great chance for a bit of quality time together.

‘Nick is often away for months at a time on tours of duty in places like Kenya and Jordan, and as soon as we get back from honeymoon he is off to Canada for two and half months.’
