Two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the Financial Ombudsman in the past year –  a rate of one every six seconds.

The service went on to investigate a record 500,000 complaints and ordered payouts to nearly 250,000 consumers.

Of those complaints taken up by the Ombudsman in the financial year to April, 378,699 were about payment protection insurance.

This figure was double that of the previous 12 months, according to its annual review.

Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction had hit ‘record levels’.

‘People are becoming more aware of their rights and less willing to put up with poor customer service,’ she said.

‘Too many financial businesses still seem unable to sort out problems themselves, without the Ombudsman  having to get involved.’ 

The high volume of complaints about PPI suggests banks are failing to clear a backlog which has built up over several years.

They are struggling to process refunds for millions of consumers mis-sold policies they did not need alongside loans and credit cards.

The scandal has led to an estimated bill of £15billion for lenders after they were ordered in 2010 to pay back premiums.

The Ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers, and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank.

Its annual report is another setback for banks, which have been mired in scandal since the 2008 credit crunch.

Justin Modray, founder of financial advice website Candid Money, said: ‘Financial giants prove time and again they’re little more than shady salesmen masquerading as  pillars of society, who routinely reject complaints they’re subsequently forced to settle.

'Continued financial mis-selling, coupled with an increasing willingness to complain, means the latest Ombudsman figures are sadly no surprise.

‘The regulator needs to get far tougher by nipping bad practices in the bud, rather than relying on the Ombudsman to sort out the mess  further down the line.’ 

The report also showed a huge rise in the number of pensioners turning to the Ombudsman as a last resort.

The over-65s accounted for a quarter of cases investigated – double the figure for 2011-12.

However, more consumers are side-stepping claims management firms, which typically grab around 25 per cent of any compensation won.

Miss Ceeney said growing numbers were ‘realising they don’t need to pay someone to make a complaint on  their behalf’.

The Big Four banking groups still dominate complaints. RBS/NatWest, Lloyds Banking Group (including HBOS),  Barclays and HSBC accounted for 62 per cent of  complaints to the service, up from 52 per cent in the previous period.

Leading institutions are still trying to recover from a string of high-profile scandals over the last year.RBS/NatWest suffered an IT system meltdown which left customers without access to their cash for weeks.

Bankers at Barclays and its rivals were strongly implicated in the interest-rate rigging furore while HSBC was reprimanded for links to money laundering by Mexican drug barons.

A spokesman for the British Bankers Association said: ‘All banks have hired more staff to deal with complaints.’

He criticised some ‘unscrupulous’ claims management firms for referring ‘large  numbers of claims to the Ombudsman, whether there are grounds to or not’.

This ‘clogs up the system, meaning that people with genuine complaints don’t always get the service they deserve’.

If
you are thinking about ditching your bank there are plenty of incentives to move.

This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promises new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
£100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.
