Lord Mandelson warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of Nick Clegg as the price of joining forces

Ed Miliband should prepare for a Coalition with Nick Clegg, according to Labour heavyweight Peter Mandelson.

The former business secretary said the party should not make the same mistake as 2010 when it refused to contemplate having to do a deal with the Lib Dems to stay in power.

Lord Mandelson warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of Mr Clegg as the price of joining forces.

The Labour peer said: ‘In 2010 some senior Lib Dems said a precondition of a viable deal with Labour was Gordon Brown’s departure.

‘Gordon did eventually agree to stand aside in the autumn, but I don’t think it would be any more appropriate to say who their leader should be than it was for them to do so in 2010.’

Lord Mandelson also said it was too early to contemplate a deal with the SNP – warning that many in the party would find it too ‘difficult to stomach’.

He said: ‘There is talk of a coalition with the SNP, rather than or in addition to the Liberal Democrats – I just think it is far too early to contemplate that, and who knows how they will do on the day.’

The Labour peer insisted that preparing for a Coalition did not mean he thought Mr Miliband was on course to fall short of a majority at the next election.

He said it was ‘not defeatist to consider the different scenarios in which we can get the Tories out’.

Speaking to the Guardian, he said: ‘Labour has to be careful about two things – it must not appear tribal or exclusive in its politics and it must not repeat its 2010 lack of preparation.’

He added: ‘Ed Miliband is an intelligent and adaptable person. If Labour is ahead on seats I am sure he will want to give it his best shot.’

The former Cabinet heavyweight – the First Secretary of State under Gordon Brown – said Labour and the Lib Dems would be able to iron out its differences.

He said: ‘Where there is a will there is a way, but it will be harder to scramble something together at the last moment if there has been no thinking through beforehand.’

Lord Mandelson added: ‘Achieving greater fairness and protecting those most in need would be relatively easy to agree between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, as would the position on Europe, while the harder issues would be reducing the financial deficit and long-term debt.

‘We cannot achieve anything we want without economic growth and policies to achieve that will have to come first. Security against terrorism would also have to be hammered out.’

Mr Miliband should consider how Labour could form a coalition with the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, said Lord Mandelson

He said Labour under Gordon Brown had failed to prepare properly for Coalition.

The peer said: ‘Some of us certainly contemplated beforehand what would happen if we lost our overall majority in 2010, but we did nothing about it, and during the weekend after polling day we had to make up in 48 hours what we had failed to do in the previous three months.

‘No real attempt had been made to get on working terms with the Liberal Democrats.

‘Gordon Brown had good personal relations with Menzies Campbell and Vince Cable, and he talked to them regularly – a relationship that continued in the weekend of talks in 2010. But he was not on the same terms with Nick Clegg.

‘We were rapidly trying to make up for lost time. Gordon asked me to lead the Labour coalition talks [and] though I doubted the post-election arithmetic would add up I gave it all we had.

‘But it was all too makeshift. If we had been serious the talking should have started long before, as I suspected it had informally between the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. For them, the chemistry fell into place quite quickly. We were fighting a losing battle.’
