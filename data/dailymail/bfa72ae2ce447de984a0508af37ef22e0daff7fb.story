Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Scott Walker used their own personal email server, in a similar way to Hillary Clinton, in what critics claim was a bid to control what correspondence was released for public scrutiny.

Republicans have attacked Mrs Clinton after it emerged that during her time as Secretary of State she used her own private email account to conduct official business. 

However an investigation by NBC news has uncovered evidence that Republican front-runner Jeb Bush used his own private email server while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who also has White House aspirations, employed a similar system.

Following the controversy involving Clinton, it has emerged that Jeb Bush and his staff used a private email server for some official correspondence, however many of these messages have been made public 

In an effort to reduce the impact of the controversy, Mrs Clinton has released 55,000 email documents from her personal files to the government to determine whether she had sent any classified information using her personal server during her time as Secretary of State.

State Department rules insist that non-classified but sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be transmitted using secure servers.

According to CNN, the Florida governor used an email address on his own jeb.org server for official and personal business. 

However, he has now released hundreds of thousands of emails in an effort to deflect criticism. 

Mrs Clinton is the 6/5 favourite to become the next resident of 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue, while Jeb Bush is the most favoured Republican at 5/2 with Scott Walker trailing at 14/1, according to bookmakers Paddy Power.

CNN claimed that there is now evidence that Jeb Bush and his staff used his personal email server to communicate while working on official Florida business.

Scott Walker's spokeswoman attacked Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, even though he was forced to admit using a similar system while in office as a Milwaukee County executive. 

Kirsten Kukowski, who represents Walker's political committee, Our American Revival, said: 'Hillary Clinton's potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about

'Wisconsin has a strong open records law with a broad presumption of access to records and the governor has very specific policies in place in his office to assure that the laws are complied with fully.' 

Two of Walker's associates were convicted of political campaigning on government time. 

Fellow Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker, pictured, has also been embroiled in the scandal

Tens of thousands of pages of emails collected by prosecutors as part of that investigation have been publicly released since the close of the probe. Walker was never charged or convicted as a result of the investigation.

Walker's staff has said that no such secret network exists in the governor's office. And Walker said last year that when he became governor in 2011 he created a 'clear distinction between things that are political and official'.

He insisted that in November 2011, after almost a year in office he introduced a policy that 'any campaign work should be done away from the Capitol or state office building', with staffers using their 'own phone, computer and personal email'. 

Clinton's email server, clintonemail.com was used in the aftermath of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city Benghazi

A House of Representatives Select Committee is investigating the attack and has issued a subpoena for any emails concerning Libya on Clinton's personal servers. 

According to Jamal D. Ware, spokesman for the Select Committee: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation. 

'The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.'

Later Ware confirmed: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi is in possession of records with two separate and distinct email addresses used by former Secretary Clinton and dated during the time she was Secretary of State.

'Without access to the relevant electronic information and stored data on the server—which was reportedly registered to her home—there is no way the Committee, or anyone else, can fully explain why the Committee uncovered two email addresses.

'As Chairman Gowdy has noted, this is why former Secretary Clinton’s exclusive use of personal emails to conduct official U.S. government business is so problematic and raises significant issues for transparency. The American people have a right to a full accounting of all the former Secretary’s emails, and the Committee is committed to working to uncover all the facts.'

Current Secretary of State John Kerry said his department is currently assessing the 55,000 documents released by Clinton vowing  that they  'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way'.

The email server was housed at the Clinton's family home in Cappaqua, New York. 

After releasing the emails to the State Department, Clinton Tweeted: 'I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them'.
