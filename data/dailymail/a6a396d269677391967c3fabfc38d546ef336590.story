Liverpool are closing in on a deal for 20-year-old Atletico Madrid defender Javier Manquillo.

Brendan Rodgers could secure the star on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent move to Anfield.

Manquillo turned down moves to Getafe, Rayo Vallecano and Marseille to play for Liverpool in the Champions League.

Prospect: Liverpool are set to make a move for young Atletico Madrid left-back Javier Manquillo

First choice: Manquillo has turned down interest from other clubs in the hope of joining Liverpool

Rodgers has been on the lookout for defensive reinforcements since the transfer window opened.

He is also keen on a deal for a left-back with Swansea's Ben Davies and Sevilla's Alberto Moreno on Liverpool's radar.

But Davies is on the brink of a move to Tottenham - along with Michel Vorm - and is training with the north Londoners and Liverpool have been frustrated all summer by Sevilla's insistence on a high fee for their prized asset Alberto Moreno.

The
 hotly-tipped Manquillo made just four appearances for Atletico last 
season.

Loic Remy’s £8.5m move QPR will be completed in the next 36 hours. The France international began his medical in Boston last night and no problems are envisaged. Liverpool, meanwhile, are looking at Brazil goalkeeper Norberto Neto.
