When Joseph Ratzinger was appointed the head of the Catholic Church in 2005 he could look forward to being ferried around in a bulletproof Popemobile.

So he decided to sell his metallic grey Volkswagen Golf which he had bought new in 1999.

Now Pope Benedict's tatty old VW Golf is expected to sell for more than £100,000 on eBay thanks to its first owner.

Popemobile: Pope Benedict sold his VW Golf when he was made Pope in 2005

Good investment: The Golf is expected to make £100,000 at auction because of its previous owner

Bargain: A similar Golf, without any famous owners, would fetch around £800 on Auto Trader

A 21-year-old German bought the car was left stunned when he later realised the owner's famous identity.

The savvy youngster cashed in on the car's history by selling it on eBay in 2005 for a staggering £127,000 - with the car smashing records as more than 10 million viewed the advert.

Its buyer, online casino GoldenPalace.com, has now decided to re-list the modest motor following Pope Benedict's decision to stand down from his role at the end of the month.

The car, which hasn't been driven 
since 2005, is being advertised in the UK on eBay, and is expected to 
cause a similar bidding frenzy as in 2005 as supporters and savvy 
investors look to get hold of the modest five-door family hatchback.

Richard
 Allen, a spokesperson for the website, is hoping the car will sell for 
more than the £127,000 paid for it and donate the proceeds to the 
Habitat for Humanity charity.

Safe: The Popemobile features bulletproof glass, a precaution taken since an attempted assassination on Pope John Paul II in 1981

He said: 'When we learned of the 
Pope's resignation we wanted to pay tribute by giving others the 
opportunity to own a piece of history.

'We
 believe that His Holiness would be especially pleased to know that the 
money raised as a result of this auction would be used to help the 
needy.'

The auction, on eBay, will end at 5pm on March 20, with Golf currently located in London.

It boasts an alarm, ABS, four airbags, air conditioning, cruise control and electric windows.
