Robin May, outside South Lakeland Magistrates' Court in Cumbria were he was banned for two years for drink driving

A drink driver crashed into a pub, ruptured a gas main and triggered the evacuation of 60 neighbours in the early hours amid fears of an explosion.

Robin May, 47, who admitted drink driving, was banned for two years and fined £100 at South Lakeland Magistrates’ Court, Cumbria.

Around 60 people had to be evacuated from their homes in the early hours of November 11 after May, of Arnside, drove his Honda into the The Ship Inn, Sandside, rupturing a gas main.

The court heard that he had 76 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35.

Landlady Lyn Million, who runs the pub with husband Ray, said she thought Mr May had ‘got off lightly’, but that he had been into the pub later on to apologise.

'I think he was quite shook up but it took a lot of courage for him to come in,' she said.

'He obviously didn’t know how we would react but we are quite forgiving people.

'It’s one of those things - a bad call on his part and he is paying the price. He did say he thought he would also get community service.

'It was quite a horrific accident and if there was a spark the pub would have gone up and our whole family would have been wiped out.'

Speaking shortly after the incident, Kendal fire station watch manager Phil Stannet said: 'There was a lot of gas in the air and I think, had it ignited, we would have had a few issues on our hands. There was a major gas leak.'

As a 400-metre exclusion was put in 
place by police and the road between Milnthorpe and Arnside was closed, 
locals were ordered to leave their homes amid fears gas could explode.

In mitigation Jackie Partington told the court that May had not planned to drive home that night.

'He had travelled into Arnside to 
meet friends and the plan was to stay with a friend, but he became 
separated from them,' she said.

'He slept in his car for an hour but woke up cold and felt OK to drive. He realises that was a stupid decision.'

May was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
