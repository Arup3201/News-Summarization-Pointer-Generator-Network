Threat: Lord and Lady Fink. The Tory grandee said he could sue Ed Miliband over his remarks

A Conservative grandee last night threatened to sue Ed Miliband for calling David Cameron a ‘dodgy prime minister surrounded by dodgy donors’.

In a spiralling row over revelations that backers of both main parties had Swiss bank accounts, the Labour leader raised allegations against Lord Fink, a Tory peer.

Lord Fink, who stepped down as party co-treasurer in 2010 and has given the Tories £3million, was among those named in documents seen by the BBC’s Panorama programme as being clients of HSBC’s Swiss private bank.

Labour donor Lord Paul, who helped to bankroll Gordon Brown’s leadership campaign, was also on the list.

The row comes amid claims that HSBC’s Swiss arm may have helped wealthy clients avoid or evade tax.

At Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons, Mr Miliband called on Mr Cameron to say what he was going to do ‘to find out about the tax avoidance activities of Lord Fink’.

In some of the most intemperate exchanges since the last election, the Labour leader declared: ‘There’s something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it’s you.’

Mr Cameron said the previous Labour government had done nothing to crack down on tax avoidance and was a ‘friend of the tax dodger’.

The Prime Minister said of Mr Miliband: ‘The only reason he is sitting there is that a bunch of trade union leaders decided he was more left wing than his brother.

‘For 13 years they [Labour] sat in the Treasury, they did nothing about tax transparency, nothing about tax dodging, nothing about tax avoidance.

‘This present government has been tougher than any previous government. That’s why they Labour are desperate, that’s why they are losing.’

The row prompted a furious response from Lord Fink, who said he would take legal action against the Labour leader if he repeated his remarks outside Parliament, where they are legally privileged.

Lord Fink said he had run a business in Switzerland for four years and had needed ‘a local bank account’ for his salary and to ‘pay grocery bills’.

‘As I already banked with HSBC in London, I set up an account with HSBC,’ he wrote in a letter to Mr Miliband.

Miliband told the Prime Minister: 'There’s something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it’s you'

‘I submitted tax returns in both Switzerland and Britain showing my revised tax status, which was accepted by the Inland Revenue.

‘I find it extraordinary that you have made claims against me that are without foundation or without contacting me. I challenge you to repeat your allegation outside the House of Commons – or to withdraw it publicly.’

Lord Paul said he had held an account with HSBC for some time in Switzerland because he had a house there, and there was ‘nothing unsavoury’ about it.

Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, named by the Guardian as another client of the bank, denied he held an account there.

‘I have never had a Swiss bank account, and do not control any Swiss bank accounts. I have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by HSBC, directly or indirectly,’ the MP said.

‘The fact is that I receive an income from an international trust, and I have paid taxes in full on all the income or capital gains I have received, irrespective of where these arise.’ His father Sir James Goldsmith, who had ‘non-domicile’ status, set up a family trust in Geneva to distribute money to the family, including to Zac and his brother Ben.

Claims: A string of public figures have come forward to deny any impropriety in their involvement with HSBC

Overall, the Conservatives are said to have received more than £5million from HSBC clients with Swiss accounts. Labour has benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth well over £500,000 and received a loan for £2million.

HM Revenue & Customs was passed a cache of documents in 2010 from France about clients of HSBC’s Swiss operation.

Offshore accounts are not against the law, but some people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities.

The Government has signed an agreement with the Swiss authorities meaning information is now shared with the UK.
