World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro has been sentenced to 10 months in jail for breaching orders to keep out of his property after it was seized by authorities.

Cannavaro, 41, has been under investigation for tax evasion and in October authorities in Naples seized almost €1m (£732,737) of goods linked to the former Real Madrid and Juventus star and his wife.

Cannavaro's brother Paolo, 33, who plays for the Italian Serie A team Sassuolo, was sentenced to six months and his wife Daniela Arenoso, 40, to four months in jail.

All three have appealed and the sentences have been suspended until the appeals court considers the cases again.

According to an investigation led by prosecutor Luigi Cannavale in the southern Italian city of Naples, the three went to the villa for a dip in the pool - ignoring the fact the property had been seized and they were banned from entering.

Prosecutors said that at the time the villa had been confiscated for suspected abuse of building regulations - including the fact that they had failed to secure planning permission from the local council to carry out works to the house, garden and pool.

The Cannavaro brothers and Arenoso were acquitted over the planning permission allegations, but convicted for entering a property illegally. 

Cannavaro won the Ballon d'Or in 2006 after leading Italy to their World Cup triumph. He moved to Real Madrid that summer and won two La Liga titles with the Spanish giants.
