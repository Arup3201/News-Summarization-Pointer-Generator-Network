Chris Joannides has been expelled from the Conservative Party for 12 months and is no longer endorsed as a candidate for May's local elections

A Conservative councillor has been 
kicked out of the party after a picture comparing burkas to binbags was 
posted on his Facebook page.

Chris
 Joannides has been expelled for a year following an investigation over 
the image which showed a woman and child in traditional Muslim dress 
standing between two black rubbish sacks.

A
 caption underneath the photograph said: ‘I saw her standing there and I
 told her she had three beautiful children. She didn’t have to get all 
p***ed off and threaten me. It was an honest mistake!’

The
 councillor, who did not compose the words on the caption, said it was 
posted on his page by a friend but he admitted having ‘shared’ it in 
what he described as ‘blokeish banter’. He said he then deleted it from 
his page.

Mr Joannides was 
initially suspended by the Enfield Conservative Group in North London 
last year when complaints emerged over the picture.

Both the police and his local party investigated the matter but decided to take no action.

But Conservative Central Office took a harsher view of his social networking behaviour.

A
 spokesman said: ‘Chris Joannides is not endorsed as a candidate in the 
forthcoming local government elections. No appeal is permitted under 
party rules. Furthermore, Mr Joannides is expelled from the party for a 
period of 12 months.

‘He may appeal against this decision and it is our understanding he intends to do so.’

Mr Joannides, who is of Greek-Cypriot origin and represents the Grange Ward in Enfield, has courted controversy before.

He
 upset colleagues by complaining that his community work often 
interferes with his social life.

On occasions he was known to message 
Facebook friends during meetings with his constituents, ask for updates 
on football scores and complain that his work meant he was missing his 
favourite TV programmes.

During
 last year’s investigation into the local politician some 27 images of 
his Facebook page revealed his frustration at a particular ward meeting 
on which he stated: ‘I’ll be surfing Facebook during the residents’ 
meeting.’

This image was shared on the Facebook profile of Mr Joannides

Since the row 
erupted Mr Joannides has repeatedly maintained he is not ‘Islamophobic’.
 He said: ‘The picture was shared on my Facebook profile by a friend and
 I deleted it straight away, but someone took a photo of it before I 
could take it down.

‘I was 
investigated by the local association and cleared. I was investigated by
 the police and cleared. I was reselected to stand in May by the local 
branch.

‘Then I got an email
 from Conservative Central Office at the 11th hour telling me they were 
suspending my membership for 12 months, effectively barring me from 
standing.

‘The rug has been pulled away from me. I am not and never have been Islamophobic.’

In
 a statement to his local newspaper he hit out at Conservative Central 
Office, saying: ‘They have punished me disproportionately.’

When
 the row first blew up he admitted he may have offended some Muslims in 
Enfield but said that the image had been around on the internet for two 
years.

He told a London radio station that the original decision to suspend him was ‘political correctness gone slightly wrong’.

Michael Lavender, leader of the Enfield Conservative group, said he supported the intervention  by the Conservatives nationally.
