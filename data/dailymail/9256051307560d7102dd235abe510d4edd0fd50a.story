Niki Taylor knew getting divorced could be a painful experience – but nothing prepared her for the heartbreak she endured when her ex-husband secretly gave away her beloved pet dog.

Niki, 39, was so distraught at losing Dolly the doberman that she has launched a remarkable nationwide hunt to find her pet.

She has already discovered that Dolly was rehomed by a local kennels – and is now trying to trace the family who took her in.

Bond: Niki Taylor, 39, and Dolly as a puppy, who was secretly given away by Niki's husband after their divorce earlier this year. It was arranged that Simon Taylor would look after the dog until she found a home

The sad saga began when Niki and Simon Taylor, 43, went through an acrimonious divorce early this year after seven years of marriage.

As part of the settlement, it was agreed Mr Taylor, a corporate headhunter, would look after Dolly for a few months while Niki found somewhere to live. Niki had owned Dolly since she was a puppy.

When Niki suffered a knee injury in April, her mother wrote to Mr Taylor asking for the arrangement to be extended.

In September, Mr Taylor told his former mother-in-law that Dolly had ‘never been happier’, but refused permission for Niki to see the dog.

Now, Niki has learned that by then her former husband had already given Dolly up to a kennels near his home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and told them to find the dog a new owner.

Niki, who has been staying with friends in West London, was contacted anonymously earlier this month and told her ex had rehomed Dolly without her knowledge.

She says that when a mutual friend contacted him, his reply made her fearful for Dolly’s welfare.

She says: ‘He told my friend he was not going to tell her what had become of Dolly. He was so vehement, I feared something worse than rehoming.’

The police told Niki they could not help and in desperation she launched a Facebook campaign.

‘Dolly licked away my tears during a very difficult time in my life and I will never forget her,’ Niki wrote.

‘It’s now my turn to make sure she is OK. Please help me find her.’

The appeal struck a chord and within days had been shared more than 40,000 times.

One well-wisher got in touch last week to help business development manager Niki track down the kennels where Dolly was last seen. However, the kennels refuse to tell her where Dolly has been rehomed.

Niki learned her ex-husband had signed the dog over to Acres Way Kennels in Benfleet, Essex.

She said: ‘They told me that Dolly had been given to a family in the area, but because of confidentiality rules, they couldn’t give me any details.

‘They assured me that Dolly is in a nice home, but at the very least, I need to know that for myself.’

Simon Taylor’s solicitor, Rash Mahal, said: ‘We had a court order and she was supposed to collect the dog by May 1.

‘She didn’t do it and she didn’t contact our client, so he had the right to rehouse the dog. Nothing more to say.’

Tom Millson, manager of Acres Way, said the dog was signed over to them in June.

‘We have behaved responsibly and conducted a visit at the home of the new owner,’ he said.

‘They are a kind couple who have looked after Dolly, but they don’t feel comfortable coming forward.’
