Ronny Deila dismissed claims that Celtic’s fragility has cleared the way for an Aberdeen title challenge on Sunday night.

And he insisted his team are ‘so good’ that they should be winning every game they play in Scotland.

With 19 matches played, the Parkhead side are four points adrift of their Pittodrie rivals - and nine points worse off than at the same stage last year.

In contrast, Aberdeen - who have played two matches more - are five points better off than they were after the same number of games last season.

Adamant nonetheless that his team are going in the right direction, Deila claimed the Dons’ form under Derek McInnes was a more significant factor than any perceived vulnerability or weakness in Celtic’s results.

And while he applauded the Dons for embarking on an eight-match winning run, Deila believes that his own team should have won every one of their last 11 games, including their two slip-ups in December when they lost 2-1 to Dundee United at Tannadice and drew 0-0 with Ross County at Celtic Park.

‘Aberdeen have done very well,’ said the Norwegian. ‘It’s not that we have been bad - they have been very good.

‘They have won eight games in a row - but in 11 (league) games we have only had one draw and one defeat.

‘If you split things into two halves in the first eight games we had four victories, two draws and two losses.

‘Now, in the last 11, we have nine victories, one draw and one defeat.

‘And we should have won every one of those games.

‘So it’s going in the right direction. We are in both cups and we have an important period coming up now.

‘I know there are high emotions taking over people, but we have to stay calm and believe in what we are doing.

‘We know we are performing well and have had good results in the last two months. We are going to keep that going.’

Having played two games less than Aberdeen, the destiny of the title remains in the champions’ own hands.

Of the view that Celtic, with superior financial and playing resources, should already have a comfortable lead, Deila added: ‘We are so good we should win every game we play here in Scotland, so when we lose I understand that people get irritated.

‘But if you win and keep on winning as we do now then Aberdeen will have to be very good to beat us.

‘Against Dundee United we did well in the first half.

‘I was not satisfied with the game against Ross County, that was a poor game. I agree with the fans that was poor. We should have performed better, but even so we should have won the game.

‘We had enough chances to win it and that was a disappointing result.

‘Otherwise I think we have played a lot of good games now.’

The Parkhead boss regards the fitness of James Forrest as key to his side’s success in the future, but fears that the winger’s continuing injury problems mean the club may not see the best of him until next season.

Deila says a fully-functioning Forrest can be like having a new player in the ranks and the Scotland international has embarked on a six-month project to cure his long-standing problems.

‘When we get him fully fit he will save us a lot of money,’ said the Norwegian. ‘I have a six-month project with him. If he can get consistency in his training we know he can be a top player.

‘He hasn’t been that for a long time because of the injuries but we will see the best of him next season. He needs time. I am not writing off this year, not at all, because he can be an important player for us.

‘He has the ability to beat a man and has great pace. We are looking for players who can be creative and we have a lot of options, but he can do that job for us.

‘He can open up defences. He will be like a new player next year.’
