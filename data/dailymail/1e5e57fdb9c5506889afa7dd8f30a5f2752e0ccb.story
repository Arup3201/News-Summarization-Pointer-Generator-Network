A wedding venue has been fined £25,000 after 46 guests at a reception were poisoned by the duck liver pate starter.

More than half the diners were taken ill after consuming the dish at Mendip Spring Golf Club in Congresbury, Somerset.

Two of the victims suffered diarrhoea for ten days and one guest was admitted to hospital with the effects of food poisoning.

Food safety officers visited Mendip Spring Golf Club after the bride's mother complained and found harmful bacteria in another batch of duck liver pate

The owner of the venue, Yeo Finance Ltd, has been fined £25,000 over the incident and director Ian Harrison, 53, ordered to pay £3,000.

More than half the guests at the wedding suffered food poisoning from the duck liver pate (file picture) started including one who had to be hospitalised

Magistrates at North Somerset Courthouse in Weston-super-Mare heard how the pate was served as a starter at the wedding in April.

But nine days later the bride's mother contacted North Somerset Council's food hygiene department after 46 of the 86 guests fell ill.

A 79-year-old guest suffered from diarrhoea for 10 days, and others were crippled by stomach cramps.

The couple, who have not been named, issued a statement which was read out to the court.

They said: 'We feel utterly humiliated that everyone had to be contacted.

'It was extremely embarrassing to hear how people have been ill.

'Our special day wasn't as special as we hoped, or Mendip Spring promised. Our guests and us will never forget this.

'Sadly no-one can change memories.'

A check by food safety officers at 
the golf club found harmful bacteria in another batch of duck liver 
pate, which was on the menu as a special.

The head chef, Jamie Stockden, had the minimum amount of food hygiene qualifications.

Mr Harrison pleaded guilty to three 
counts of contravening food hygiene regulations concerning staff 
training, failing to recognise food preparation hazards and failing to 
prove compliant with such hazards.

Yeo Finance Ltd also pleaded guilty to two counts of serving unsafe food.

The couple did not have to pay for their wedding reception after complaining, the court was told.
