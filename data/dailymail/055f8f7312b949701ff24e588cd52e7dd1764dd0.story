It is a culinary scandal which has gone right to the top of the political food chain and left Bill de Blasio with a rather sour taste in his mouth.

But the New York City Mayor may find his first crisis in office a little easier to swallow knowing that it will eventually help those most in need.

In an incident dubbed Forkgate, de Blasio provoked mock outrage after being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork instead of with his hands as is the New York way.

Now the owner of the Goodfella's Pizzeria where he was pictured has kept hold of said fork and plans to auction it for charity.

Put a fork in him: de Blasio earned the disapproval of New Yorkers when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at Goodfellas, Staten Island

Marc Cosentino, a retired NYPD 
sergeant, placed the fork in an evidence bag he acquired from a former 
colleague and is proudly displaying it behind the bar.

He told dnainfo.com: 'I just did it because I thought it was funny.

'Then all of a sudden it got all this interest, so I thought let's do something, let's do something for charity.'

It's not clear when the utensil will go up for auction or which charity will benefit.

Fewer
 than 10 days into his term as mayor, de Blasio found himself on the 
defensive after a picture of him using utensils spread across Twitter, 
prompting mock outrage among on blogs and news sites.

Responding
 to the pizza palaver, de Blasio said that his Italian ancestry is 
behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style.

'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and Iâ€™ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said.

Hand it to him: de Blasio did eventually pick up his slice

It's a method New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter.

As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands.

The
 incident, already dubbed 'Forkgate,' happened at Staten Island pizza 
joint Goodfellas last Friday, where de Blasio stopped in for lunch with 
local business owners.

Proving he is not a complete heathen, though, de Blasio explained that he likes to use his hands too.

His method is a combination of the Italian and New York styles, he said, describing it as 'very complicated.'

'I often start with a knife and fork. But then I cross over to the American approach and pick it up when I go farther into the pizza,' he told a reporter who questioned his methods, adding that the inquiry was a 'very important question.'

Charles Greinsky witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what's right.

One of us: Conservative pals Donald Trump and Sarah Palin made news in 2011 when they stepped out of Trump's presumably gold-plated apartment in Trump tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork

The American way: Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama would win approval from New Yorkers with their pizza approach

He told The New York Times he loved having de Blasio in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza-eating.

'No,' he told The New York Times. 'No. It's blasphemy.'

Relenting a little, he added, 'He's from Boston. He doesn't know any better.'

For the record, de Blasio ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie.
