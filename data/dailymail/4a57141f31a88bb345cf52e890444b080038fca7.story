After months of planning your wedding, it's time to really have some fun.

So, why not let loose and opt for a honeymoon that's a bit more adventurous than your standard all-inclusive beach resort getaway?

Whether you'd prefer to be treated like a queen in a luxury suite in a real French castle or give something back by volunteering with school children in Nepal, we've got you and your new significant other covered.

For a truly unique means of travel, explore the Irish countryside in a horse-drawn gypsy caravan. Several companies offer week-long packages, like Mayo Horsedrawn Caravan Holidays, which start at €720 (about £577) for seven days, and will take you around some of the lushest greenery in the world. There are options to fly into Shannon or Dublin, as airport transfers are also available. Ryanair flies regularly to both airports from London, starting at £45.99 one way. 

Alternatively, rent a car and head south along the Pacific Coast Highway in California for breath-taking Big Sur views. Start your  drive in Monterey (near San Francisco) and head south to Los Angeles to truly experience one of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in the country. Don't miss the many state reserves and parks, the quaint town of Carmel-by-the-Sea or the stunning Hearst Castle, located in San Simeon.

For the couple that prefers something off the beaten path, spend a week in the rain forests of Costa Rica at an eco-friendly resort. The Pacuare Lodge is nestled overlooking the Pacuare River and offers thrill-seeking partners the chance to raft down the river as part of their stay.

Best of all, it's located on a private reserve that protects more than 1.2 million acres of Central America's tropical wilderness.

For those with winter weddings, your romantic getaway can be made even more memorable by checking into Canada's only ice hotel. Located only 20 minutes from Quebec City, Hotel de Glace is a must-see attraction each winter - open from January 5 until March 22, 2015. 

The hotel's Romantic Getaway package is priced from $999 (about £550) depending on the month.

More adventurous couples may prefer to travel to the Gobi desert to stay in a traditional Mongolian yurt. Three Camel Lodge offers twenty deluxe yurts, known as gers, which each include a private bathroom, a king sized bed and even toiletries made from camel milk.

The gers offer unobstructed views of the Gobi-Altai Mountains and there are also plenty of opportunities for eco-friendly relaxation with an on-site bar, restaurant and spa.

With trips to suit all tastes, these are the most unconventional honeymoon options out there.

Who needs a conventional honeymoon? Issaquah's TreeHouse Point, about 30 minutes from Seattle, offers a unique B&B experience among the tall trees, with their 'Nest' accommodation starting at $255 (£160) per night
