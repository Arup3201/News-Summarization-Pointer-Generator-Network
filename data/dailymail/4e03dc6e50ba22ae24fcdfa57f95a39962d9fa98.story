Any male, graduating seniors at Lowell High School in San Francisco must first report to the school's 'head penis inspector' Richard L. Dong for their mandatory penis inspection before their officially allowed to graduate.

That's according to a rather official looking flier that was distributed throughout the school last week, on which an illustration of a patriotic penis and the slogan 'no penis left behind' also appears.

Believe it or not, penis inspector Richard L. Dong is not real, and Lowell High School doesn't actually require its seniors to pass a penis inspection before they're allowed to graduate - rather, school officials believe the amusing fliers are just a senior prank orchestrated by members of the school's graduating class.

Pranksters: School officials believe the amusing fliers were part of a prank pulled by graduating seniors

'Late Monday afternoon, fliers announcing a phony inspection notice for 
students were posted in the halls of Lowell High,' the school district says in a statement obtained by SFGate.com. 'The fliers, which mentioned a male body part, were 
removed and the dean of students at Lowell is investigating. Lowell 
administration is regarding this incident as a senior prank, and the 
infractions will be addressed according to school and district 
policies.'

The pranksters - who explain on the fliers that circumcised and non-circumcised students must report to different locations to complete their inspection, and also that anyone with an erection will be given a failing grade - are not the first to pull the 'mandatory penis inspection' stunt.

In fact, the penis inspection prank has become somewhat common amongst graduating seniors at Bay area high schools

Tradition: Lowell High School (pictured) is just the latest of several San Francisco Bay-area schools to fall victim to the penis inspection prank

In 2012, Castro Valley High School - just across San Francisco Bay from Lowell High School - was the victim of a similar prank when a flier that was nearly identical to the one passed around Lowell High School was distributed throughout the school.

In 2011, the same thing happened at Carlmont High School just south of San Francisco.

Just in case any students have any questions about their mandatory penis inspections, they're instructed to contact Mike Hawk - the 'director of Genital Commissions.'
