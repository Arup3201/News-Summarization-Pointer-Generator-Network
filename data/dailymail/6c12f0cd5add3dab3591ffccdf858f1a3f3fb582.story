A motorist who killed a young bride-to-be while speeding on a country road was nicknamed 'The Stig' by friends, a court has heard.

Hannah Seeley was buried in the wedding dress she never had the chance to wear, her father said.

Luke Anderson was apparently driving at 81mph when he smashed into the midwife on a small road near Pakenham in Suffolk.

Miss Seeley's mother Karen and her fiancé Mark Wade went out to look for her after she failed to return home on April 22 last year, and came across the crash site.

Victim: The young midwife was killed while driving home three days after buying her wedding dress

Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court heard that the 23-year-old's death came just three days after she bought her dress for the wedding which was scheduled to take place in September.

In an emotional statement, her father revealed that she was buried in the dress and said to the killer driver, 'A wedding dress in a coffin, Luke - a wedding cross in a coffin.'

Kevin Seeley, 50, spoke about how he waited until his daughter's wedding day until he saw a picture of her in her wedding dress.H

He joined his wife, Karen, 49, and Hannah's Mr Wade, 27, on a trip to see the tragic bride-to-be laid to rest in her wedding dress.

But during his last goodbye, Mr Seeley put a sheet over his daughter's dress because he felt it was not right for the father-of-the-bride to see it until Hannah's wedding day.

Five months later he was finally able to look at a picture of his daughter - taken at a dress fitting three days before she died.

Tragic: The bride-to-be was buried in the wedding dress she had just bought and would never wear

The warehouse operative said: 'We 
buried her in the dress because she loved it and there has been no 
fall-out whatsoever about that decision.

'But the first time I actually saw the dress was on the day that she was supposed to get married.

"When I went to see her I made them 
cover the dress up because the father-of-the-bride isn't supposed to see
anything like that until the wedding day.

'Her fiance Mark saw it that day and 
that was the first time he had seen it too. He had bought a wedding ring
that day for Hannah too.

'On her actual wedding day all her 
family and close friends who were closely involved in the wedding went 
up to the beach and spent a day together.

'That morning I had stepped aside at 
the time that Hannah would have been getting married and I took a 
picture of her in her wedding dress out of my pocket.

'That was the first time I saw the dress. She shouldn't have been in my pocket that day. She should have been on my arm.

'I just cried when I saw it. We got 
more than 500 cards when she died and I think that goes to show how 
popular she was with people.'

Anderson, 22, from Barningham in 
Suffolk, admitted causing death by careless inconsiderate driving, and 
will appear at Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing.

In
yesterday's hearing before magistrates, prosecutor Ian Devine said that
Anderson was known as 'The Stig' after the anonymous racing driver who 
tests cars on motoring show Top Gear.

He described how the motorist's VW Golf strayed into the middle of the road as he rounded a bend on the A143 and smashed into Miss Seeley's car, which was forced into a nearby field.

Anderson's speedometer was frozen at 81mph, which police said indicated he must have been driving at a minimum of 70mph.

The driver later told police he had 'no recollection of the accident'.

Miss
Seeley and Mr Wade, 27, who lived together in Stanton, were due to wed 
on September 15, two years after they became engaged in Paris.

A witness statement from the victim's father which was read out in court detailed the family's heartbreak at her death.

'On
Monday, April 23, 2012, Karen, Hannah's mother, Kirsty, her sister, 
Mark, her fiancé and myself, visited Hannah in the chapel of rest,' it 
read.

'Her eyes were half open as if she was waking up. If only that was true, rather than closed for eternity.'

David
Stewart, defending, said Anderson felt 'genuine remorse' and had 
accepted responsibility for the accident at the earliest opportunity.

Anderson has admitted causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving and was due to be sentenced but the court declined jurisdiction and sent the case to Ipswich Crown Court.

At the time of the accident, Mr Wade said of his fiancée: 'She was my soulmate, my best friend, my world and now it's all gone.'

The couple had already sent out their wedding invitations, and had booked a honeymoon in New York and Las Vegas.

Now Mr Wade and Hannah's family and friends are fundraising fora 
new birthing pool room at the hospital where she worked as a midwife.

The pool will be named after her and overlook a courtyard where a tree has been planted in her memory.
