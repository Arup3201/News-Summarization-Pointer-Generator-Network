A Las Vegas police officer who was trying to rescue a stranded hiker on Mount Charleston, northwest of the city, died after falling from a helicopter harness last night.Search and rescue officer David Vanbuskirk, 36, of Henderson, became separated from the harness at some point during the helicopter rescue and fell from a cliff.

The helicopter crew lowered Vanbuskirk down to the hiker. As they attempted to bring the two back up to the aircraft, the officer fell to his death.

Dedicated officer: Search and rescue officer David Vanbuskirk, 36, had been with the police department for 13 years

Las Vegas police assistant sheriff 
Joseph Lombardo said the area - which was just above Mary Jane Falls in 
Mount Charleston - was too difficult to access by foot, so rescuers used
a helicopter to hoist the hiker to safety.

Lombardo didn't say how far the officer fell. Vanbuskirk had been with the department since October 1999, officer Bill Cassell said.

KLAS-TV reported the hiker reached the helicopter and was not injured.

TV cameras captured a procession of 
police cars driving through the dark with their lights on after the 
accident in a gesture of respect for the fallen officer.

Loss: Joseph Lombardo said the tragedy had affected his team deeply

'We're a big family, a close family, and this is going to be trying on us for quite a while,' Lombardo told media.

'We will survive it. We'll come back together, and hopefully in my lifetime, it will never happen again.'The National Transportation Safety Board, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the police department will investigate

'Our team is devastated by the loss of Dave, a well-respected member of our team - a leader and a friend,' said a message on the Metro Search and Rescue Facebook page, which has a picture of a badge with a black ribbon across it.

'Thank you for all of your support and condolences. It is an understatement to say that he will be greatly missed.'

Las Vegas police assistant sheriff Joseph Lombardo says that there will be an investigation by National Transportation Safety Board, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and LVMPD into the incident.

According to KTNV, officer David Vanbuskirk leaves behind a wife and children.
