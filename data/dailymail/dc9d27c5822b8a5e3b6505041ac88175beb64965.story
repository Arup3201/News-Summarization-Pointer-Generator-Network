A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas halting the Gaza war appeared to be holding today, as the full extent of the devastation became clear as Palestinians were able to leave shelters and return to their homes.

Hopes for an end to the bloodshed in the region were boosted after the two sides agreed to the Egyptian-brokered 72-hour truce, which went into effect at midnight local time on Sunday.

In Cairo, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said the ceasefire would allow humanitarian aid into battered Gaza neighborhoods and the reopening of indirect talks on a more lasting and comprehensive deal.

Israeli negotiators arrived in the Egyptian capital today for talks on ending the month-old Gaza war which has killed 1,910 Palestinians and 67 Israelis.

Elsewhere, four wounded Palestinians were flown into Ankara for medical treatment today, the first sign of Turkey's promised plan to evacuate thousands from the Gaza Strip.

Turkey said last week it was seeking Israeli and Egyptian agreement for an air corridor to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza.

'Our wounded from Gaza have started to come,' Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters meeting the flight from Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv.

Medics carried three Palestinian women and a male youth on stretchers into waiting ambulances at Ankara's Esenboga airport.

The month-long war, pitting the Israeli military against rocket-firing Hamas militants, has killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, the majority civilians, Palestinian and U.N. officials say. In Israel, 67 people have been killed, all but three of them soldiers, officials there say.

The ceasefire follows renewed violence since the last temporary deal lapsed. More than a dozen Palestinians were 
said to have died in Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, while mortar 
and rocket fire from Gaza had resumed.

Hamas
 is seeking an end to a painful Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza, while
 Israel wants Hamas to dismantle its arsenal of rockets and 
other weapons.

Qais Abdelkarim, a member of the Palestinian delegation, said indirect talks with the Israelis would begin this morning.

‘We
 are going to engage in serious talks in the 72 hours to end the 
blockade and deliver humanitarian materials into Gaza with the hope of 
reaching a lasting ceasefire,’ he said.

The goal, he added, was to end the blockade, which he called ‘the reason for the war’.

The
 Egyptian-mediated talks are aimed at reaching a long-term arrangement 
following the heaviest fighting between Israel and Hamas since the 
Islamic militant group took control of Gaza in 2007.

The fighting ended in a 72-hour ceasefire last Tuesday, during which Egypt had hoped to mediate a long-term deal.

But
 when the three-day window expired, militants resumed their rocket fire,
 sparking Israeli reprisals. The violence continued throughout the 
weekend, including a burst of fighting last night ahead of the ceasefire.

The Israeli 
military reported some 30 rocket attacks out of Gaza, while Palestinian 
medical officials said seven people were killed in Israeli airstrikes, 
all yesterday.

Among the dead was the bodyguard of a Hamas leader, the 
medical officials said.

Israel
 had walked away from ceasefire talks over the weekend, after militants 
resumed their rocket fire. ‘Israel will not negotiate under fire,’ prime
 minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, warning that his country's military 
campaign ‘will take time’.

Last
 week's talks failed in part because Israel rejected Hamas' demand for a
 complete end to the blockade.

Israel says the closure is a necessary 
security measure, and officials do not want to make any concessions that
 would allow Hamas to declare victory.

A
 senior Palestinian negotiator acknowledged that the Palestinians would 
make more modest demands this time around.

He said they will seek an end
 to the bloodshed in Gaza, internationally backed efforts to rebuild and
 an easing - but not an end - to the blockade.

‘We
 might not get everything we want, particularly on freedom of movement. 
But we believe the Israelis and the world have gotten the point that 
Gazans should live normally and things should be much better than 
today,’ said the negotiator.

Israel
 says the blockade is needed to prevent arms smuggling and that Hamas 
must disarm.

Hamas has said handing over its arsenal, which is believed 
to include several thousand remaining rockets, is out of the question.

The
 blockade has greatly limited the movement of Palestinians in and out of
 the impoverished territory of 1.8million people for jobs and study 
abroad.

It has also limited the flow of goods into Gaza, and blocked 
virtually all exports.

An 
Egyptian crackdown on smuggling tunnels along Gaza's southern border has
 made things even tougher by robbing Hamas of its key economic pipeline 
and weapons conduit.

Gaza's unemployment rate is above 50 per cent and 
Hamas is unable to pay the salaries of tens of thousands of workers.

An
 easing of the blockade would mean an increased role for Western-backed 
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces were ousted by Hamas 
seven years ago.

Officials 
said that the rival Palestinian factions were already exploring options 
that would give Abbas, who now governs in the West Bank, a foothold in 
Gaza, including the likely control of its border crossing with Egypt.

At
 a minimum though, Israel will want guarantees that the rocket fire will
 stop. A 2012 ceasefire promised an easing of the blockade, but was 
never implemented - in part because of sporadic rocket attacks by 
various armed factions in Gaza.

Israeli
 Justice Minister Tzipi Livni said Hamas could get the blockade lifted 
by accepting long-standing international demands to renounce violence 
and recognize Israel's right to exist.

‘They
 want to get legitimacy as a terrorist organisation, without accepting 
the requirements of the international community,’ she told a news 
conference.
