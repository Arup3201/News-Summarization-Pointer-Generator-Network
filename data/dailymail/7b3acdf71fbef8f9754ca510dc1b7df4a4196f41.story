Scarred: Michaela Eaton required hour-long emergency surgery to treat the deep wound

A toddler required emergency surgery and was lucky not to lose an eye after she fell onto railings during a supervised playtime at nursery.

Three-year-old Michaela Eaton was left scarred for life when she slipped and cracked her head on metal railings during a game of hide and seek at Castle Vale Nursery in Birmingham, West Midlands.

Her furious parents claim the nursery failed to carry out a written report regarding the safety of the railings and have since issued a formal health and safety report themselves.

Michaela’s father, Mark Eaton, 39, said: ‘There needs to be something done to stop this happening again to another child, and I couldn’t believe when I asked to see the results of a health and safety report and was told there wasn’t any written report.’

Mr Eaton and wife Edwina, 43, rushed to the nursery after they were telephoned and told Michaela had cut her head.

Mr Eaton said: ‘Michaela was sat in the office with a compress on her head. It was only when the paramedics arrived that we saw the true extent of her injury.’

Michaela was rushed to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where she went straight into theatre for emergency surgery on her face.

Plastic surgeons spent over an hour stitching up a deep gash just millimetres from her eye, which doctors warn will probably leave a large scar.

Mr Eaton said: ‘Her injury was so deep she was lucky she didn’t lose an eye. It was just horrific and she was crying her eyes out.’

Supervised: A spokesperson for Castle Vale Nursery said the playground was fully staffed at the time

He added: ‘When my wife saw her injury 
she almost fainted and I just couldn’t believe it… They say it was 
supervised play, but I don’t understand why there are railings so close 
to where children are playing.’

Since the incident, which happened in 
November, staff at Castle Vale Nursery 
have apologised and carried out a health and safety inspection, claiming
 the railing ‘did not constitute a significant hazard.’

But
 when Mr Eaton asked to see the health and safety report, he was told by
 staff at the Health and Safety Executive there wasn’t one, and a 
spokesperson from the council-run nursery said the information was given
 verbally to the deputy-head teacher.

Disbelief: Michaela's father Mark Eaton (right) says the nursery failed to issue a health and safety report

Mr
 Eaton said: ‘When I found out the nursery hadn’t even written a report,
 I couldn’t believe it. I was told the findings were that the railings 
were a normal school fence and that this information was given verbally 
to a teacher.’

Horrific: Michaela suffered a deep wound just millimetres above her right eye

He has now written and submitted a health and safety report himself.

Mr Eaton said: ‘I just want the issue to 
be taken seriously. Michaela was lucky not to be blinded- another child 
who falls over might not have the same luck.’

He added: ‘All they would have to do would is plant some bushes in front of the railings, which would prevent the children from playing near them. It is surely much better for children to perhaps have a scratch from a bush, rather than a horrific injury involving the railings.’

Mr Eaton says staff at the nursery are hoping Michaela will return, but the family are not so sure.

He said: ‘We need to wait for the doctors to check over Michaela’s wound in February before she can go back to nursery. She really enjoyed it there, it is just a shame her accident doesn’t seem to be taken seriously.’

A spokesperson from Castle Vale Nursery, said: ‘We are very sorry that Michaela had such a nasty accident in the school playground while playing hide and seek with a friend…The playground was fully supervised at the time of the accident.’

The spokesperson added: ‘Following the accident there was a health and safety inspection and the officer who conducted the inspection was satisfied the railing did not constitute a significant hazard…This information was given verbally to the deputy head teacher.’
