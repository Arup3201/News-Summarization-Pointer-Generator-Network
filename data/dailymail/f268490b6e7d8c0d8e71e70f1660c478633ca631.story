Sitting in the middle of a vast desert, an eerie abandoned cinema lies waiting for its first movie to be screened.

It has been over a decade since the outdoor cinema was built in the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, at the bottom of a desert mountain range.

The site is accessible by just one road - called Dusti Road - and few people ever go there.

Now the 150 wooden seats are weathered and worn by the apocalyptic surroundings, and remain empty. The screen's foundations stand broken and the building housing the generator and projector has been left crumbling.

What a picture: The abandoned cinema is still waiting for its first movie to be screened

View from space: The 'End of the World' cinema, located in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt

According to Kaupo Kikkas, the Estonian photographer who took these shots, the End of the World Cinema was built by a wealthy Frenchman who decided it would be the perfect location for a bizarre cinema.

He went to Cairo to buy everything he needed from an old theatre.

However
 things didn't exactly go according to plan. On the night of the 
premiere the generator powering its grand debut cut out.

Apparently,
 the local authorities weren't very excited about the idea of having a 
theatre in the middle of the desert, and it is suspected that they might
 have had something to do with the premiere's incidents.

Mr
 Kikkas said: 'Egypt is and was kind of a police state. In Sinai it's 
actually forbidden to go to the desert if you don't take a tour or 
organized trip. These tours and trips take you to all the same places 
and actually one route is just two miles away from the cinema.

'I
 think most of the locals know about this place but because of the 
â€˜confusionâ€™ between this Frenchman, local government and Bedouins, it's a
 topic that's not really talked about,' he added.

'At
 the premier evening everything went "accidentally" wrong, their 
electricity generator was sabotaged and no movies were ever screened at 
the End of the World Cinema.'

As if the auditorium had risen from the sands of the Sinai itself, an abandoned cinema lies in waiting for an audience that never came
