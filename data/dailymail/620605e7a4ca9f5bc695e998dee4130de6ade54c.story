This video gives a whole new meaning to the expression 'barking up the wrong tree'.

Casey Lantz from Las Vegas filmed his brother's dog enthusiastically getting his teeth into park shrubbery.

Footage shows the canine determinedly attacking a tree trunk and attempting to rip off branches. 

But despite his best efforts he fails to break off any twigs.

Lantz tells the pup to get down but the creature refuses to listen.

He continues to sabotage the timber.

At one point the pup dangles from the tree with a branch between his jaws.

After more than half a minute he shows no sign of giving up.

Another video shows the dog repeating the same stunt with a different tree.
