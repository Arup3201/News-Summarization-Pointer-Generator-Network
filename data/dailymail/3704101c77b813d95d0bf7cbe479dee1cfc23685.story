The masses of long lenses and a hoard of photographers could suggest a famous face had just arrived in Hartlepool.

But these snappers were on the look-out for a much rarer specimen which had just flown into town - the Orphean Warbler. 

Yesterday’s sighting of the rare grey and white bird on the bowling green in Hartlepool's Headland was the first in Britain for over 20 years.

All a flutter: Birdwatchers set up long lens cameras to capture images of the Orphean Warbler which had landed in Hartlepool

Rare sight: The bird, which is grey with a black head and white throat, winters in Africa and migrates to Turkey and around the Mediterranean. It has only been spotted six times in Britain

It is rarely seen in Northern Europe and has only been spotted six times in Britain.

Ornithologist Chris Brown, of Hartlepool, said the bird had overshot and ended up in the town.

He said: 'It’s more common to see them in France or Spain, but it’s very rare to see them in Britain.

'The warbler was seen on the bowling green in Hartlepool and an alert went out instantaneously and people came from all over England and Scotland to see it, there were thousands of people.

'They were all around the bowling green trying to catch a glimpse of it in the bushes.

'It was quite hard to spot but eventually the bird found it’s way into the mist net that was set up and it was ringed, and I got some photos of it then in hand.'

Who's a pretty bird: Ornithologist Chris Brown said 'It was quite hard to spot but eventually the bird found it's way into the mist net that was set up and it was ringed, and I got some photos of it then in hand'

He said that there are still some bird-watchers looking out for the bird and were heading out further to track it down.

The bird winters in Africa and migrates to Turkey and around the Mediterranean.

The first sighting was recorded in Portland in 1955 and the most recent was in Cornwall in 1991.

In June last year another rare visitor appeared on the Headland at Hartlepool, a white-throated robin, which had not been seen in Britain for 11 years.

In November last year, birdwatchers got more than they bargained for when they stumbled across a glamour shoot taking place at South Gare, Redcar.

They had arrived to see the Hume’s Leaf Warber, a distinctive green and yellow bird native to Asia, but came across a blonde model in a G-string on a motorbike, posing for a photos.
