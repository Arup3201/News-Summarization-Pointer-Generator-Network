Scores of  BRITs viewers have complained about ITV's heavy muting of Kanye West's performance which they said distorted the track so much it sounded 'like Morse code'.

Huge chunks of the song had no sound as producers muted offensive words and phrases during a 20 second delay as the live show was broadcast last night. 

The American rapper was joined by fire breathers and a host of other performers to debut his new track All Day at London's O2 Arena shortly after 9pm, the UK watershed.

With the N word repeated throughout, ITV producers decided to mute sections viewers may have found offensive instead of bleeping the words.

Scores of viewers complained after ITV muted  chunks of Kanye West's performance during the Brits last night, with some saying the track became so distorted it sounded 'like Morse code'

The rapper was joined by a host of other musician to perform his new track All Day which was riddled with offensive language

The move ruined the star's performance, viewers said, with some questioning why it ever went ahead if so much of the song had to be censored. 

Others thought their TVs had broken when the sound was pulled without warning. ITV flashed an 'audio mute' sign in the corner of the screen, but many failed to notice it. 

Ofcom, the television watchdog, received 125 complaints from viewers after the performance. 

'Ofcom has received 125 complaints regarding the Kanye West’s BRIT Awards performance on ITV. We are assessing these before deciding whether to investigate or not,' a spokesman said today.

This morning no complaints had been made over ITV's editing of the performance.  

But Twitter users were quick to slam the channel's choice of censorship, with many saying it ruined the entire song. 

'So much muted audio it sounded like Morse code,' said one Twitter user, while another asked: 'Why have him perform if they knew he was gonna (sic) swear?' 

Scores of viewers took to social media to complain about the channel's editing of the show, with many confused when the sound on their televisions suddenly cut out

Shocked: Lionel Ritchie and Taylor Swift were surprised by the rapper's language as they watched the live performance last night

ITV stood by its decision to mute the offending parts of the song this morning with the performance taking place only shortly after the 9pm watershed.

'ITV took the decision to use an audio mute during the performance. The Brits is broadcast live on ITV from 8pm to a wide audience,' a spokesman told MailOnline.

'We have operated a short time delay as standard practice for some years on the show, to allow us to mute language that may be inappropriate for that wide audience, and elected to do so in this case, given the performance took place shortly after the 9pm watershed.' 

Kanye West was introduced by wife Kim Kardashian-West who insisted on taking a selfie with hosts Ant and Dec before gushing about her husband. 

After his performance the reality TV queen took to her Twitter account to share her pride. 

'Such a sick performance!!!' she wrote above a photograph of the rapper and his crew of back-up performers which some suggested had been inspired by the mobs of the London riots. 

But other celebrities were not as impressed, with Taylor Swift and Lionel Ritchie visibly shocked with the rapper's choice of language.  

Later viewers and the arena's audience were left stunned when Madonna fell down a stack of prop-stairs, landing on her back mid-performance.

The singer was pulled backwards when a back-up dancer tugged on her costume cape, but recovered quickly to finish her rendition of Living for Love. 

Later  in the evening fans were left stunned as Madonna took a tumble down a flight of prop stairs during her performance of the song Living for Love
