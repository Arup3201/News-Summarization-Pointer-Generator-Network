A quarter of patients would not recommend their local hospital, a survey revealed yesterday.

Their complaints included ant-infested floors, wards stinking of sewage and uncollected rubbish.

Others objected to doctors and nurses who made them feel as if they were on a  factory production line.

Some claimed nursing staff spent much of their time clock-watching or failed to wash their hands properly.

High risk: Patients taken to hospital over the weekend for emergency treatment have a higher chance of dying, according to statistics (Posed by models)

The Dr Foster research firm looked at 
the responses of 8,864 patients on the NHS Choices website and found 
that 26 per cent of them would not recommend their local hospital to a 
friend.

However, 58 per cent would do so however, while the remainder had no opinion either way.

Lack of cleanliness was one of the 
main reasons for the complaints to the website. One patient, who was 
treated at Whipps Cross University Hospital in North-East London, said 
ants had the run of the ward he was treated on. He also claimed food was
not cleared from his bedside table for four days.

A patient admitted to Queen’s Hospital
in Romford, East London, said bloodied dressings covered the floor and 
another said the ward stank of sewage.

At Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham,
a patient said black rubbish bags were left along the corridor. Another
complained that the same hospital was so dirty he ‘feared getting an 
infection’.

Some 72 per cent of patients who 
complained were upset at being ‘left in the dark’ by doctors and nurses 
who refused to speak to them about their illness or treatment.

One patient who had been brought in to
the A&E department at Newham General Hospital in East London 
described doctors and nurses as ‘robotic’ and said they felt like they 
were on ‘some sort of mass production line’. A mother who gave birth at 
Queen’s Hospital said she had been ‘made to feel like an animal’.

The report also found that patients 
who are admitted to A&E during the evenings or weekends are 10 per 
cent more likely to die.

It warned that in many trusts too few 
senior consultants work outside of office hours meaning that patients 
are left in the hands of junior doctors.

In nearly a third of hospitals no 
senior staff were on site all weekend. Overall mortality rates, however,
were found to have fallen by 20 per cent over the past decade.

The lengthy report also disclosed that
some health trusts put just one nurse in charge of more than 20 elderly
patients at any one time.

At South Tyneside NHS trust in Tyne 
and Wear the average is one nurse to 29.5 patients while at Frimley Park
in Surrey the ratio is one to 20.

Dr Peter Carter of the Royal College 
of Nursing said: ‘Trusts now need to look at their staffing levels as a 
matter of urgency. Due to the complex needs of many older people, having
staff with the right mixture of skills and experience on the ward is 
vital.’

Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of 
the NHS in England, said: ‘Mortality rates are going down, but hospitals
with high rates and poor outcomes in the evenings and at weekends must 
investigate to see where performance may be falling short and look to 
those with the best rates to see how they can improve.’

Professor Keogh added: ‘I will be 
asking the NHS medical directors to look closely at weekend services to 
ensure patients admitted at weekends receive the same standards of care 
as those during the week.’

The Dr Foster report includes an analysis of patient comments made online about their hospital stay.

It revealed that disrespect and not being kept informed are the two main reasons why patients would not recommend their hospital. This was found to matter far more than single-sex wards or cleanliness.
