Celtic have turned up the heat ahead of a potentially-fraught League Cup final by slamming the SFA’s decision to let Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher play in Sunday’s Hampden showpiece.

The Englishman escaped a red card after referee Craig Thomson sent off team-mate Paul Paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final.

That decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on Wednesday, when Celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday.

United’s Nadir Ciftci – already banned from the Hampden showpiece – faces a further two-match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at Parkhead skipper Scott Brown.

But Celtic are furious that Butcher will be free to play in the final, even if Paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. A club statement read: ‘It seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that, in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed, the Dundee United player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer – and would be available to play in the League Cup Final and the Scottish Cup replay between the teams – while Celtic’s player (van Dijk) may potentially miss both of those matches.

‘Celtic and Virgil van Dijk maintain their position that no red-card offence was committed by Virgil. Virgil will appear at Hampden to put his case on Thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal.’

United refused to comment publicly on Tuesday night, but are privately furious at some of Celtic’s comments.

Brown, meanwhile, has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on Ciftci.

The United striker lashed out in retaliation at the Scotland midfielder before van Dijk and United’s Paton were controversially dismissed by Thomson on the advice of assistant Graham Chambers.

There will be no SFA action against Tannadice winger Aiden Connolly, however, despite claims by Celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the Scottish Cup stalemate.

Expressing relief that Brown has been cleared to play on Sunday, team-mate Stefan Johansen said the SFA had reached the right decision in that regard.

‘I saw the tackle from Broony,’ said the Norwegian. ‘It was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it.

‘He would have been a big loss - but I didn’t think that was going to happen. He is the captain and means a lot to the team. We could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season. He’s a great player and a fantastic captain. He gives it out but he takes it back. That is part of his game. It’s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles.’

The failure to penalise Brown’s challenge was blamed by United boss Jackie McNamara for sparking the incident which saw Ciftci lash out with his boot.

Offered a fast-track two-match ban by the SFA compliance officer, Ciftci has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint.

If he declines, a Fast Track Tribunal will convene tomorrow. Failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the Scottish Cup replay with Celtic and the subsequent Premiership clash between the sides.

Despite rising tensions, Johansen believes the League Cup final will not go the same way as the Scottish Cup tie – which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period.

‘It was a weird game, with three red cards and two penalties,’ he said. ‘It affects the game, of course, but I think it will be different this time. I don’ t think what happened on Sunday will affect the final. It’s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners.

‘I am just focusing on ourselves. If we go out and play the way we can then we have a great chance.’
