Rebuilding her life: Michelle Smith, who lost four children in a fatal house fire, has since given birth to twins as she tries to make a fresh start

A mother who lost four of her children in a fire started by a pyromaniac who was staying with her family has given birth to twins as she tries to move on from the tragedy.

Michelle Smith, who attended every day of the seven-week trial, gave birth to a boy and a girl who are now aged six months.

She had kept the new arrivals secret during the court case.

Miss Smith, 37, lost her four-year-old twins Holly and Ella in the fire and their brothers Jordan, two, and Reece, 19.

Killer Dyson Allen, 19, turned on the Smith family which had given him help and accommodation after he had been thrown out of his own home by his mother.

The drunk and stoned teenager set a wardrobe on fire at the drug-fuelled party in Freckleton, Lancashire, as Miss Smith celebrated her 36th birthday.

Allen was convicted of four counts of manslaughter yesterday and told he faced ‘a substantial prison sentence’.

Miss Smith, who was best friends with Allen's mother, had taken the 19-year-old into her home in a gesture of kindness after he was forced to walk the streets over Christmas.

Asked what the 18 months after the fire 
ripped through her property on January 7 last year had been like, she described them simply as 'hell'.

Although Reece, 19, tried to save his three siblings all four of the youngsters were killed by the effects of smoke inhalation.

In a family statement issued on the steps of the court yesterday, Miss Smith said: 'We still do not know why our children were taken away from us. Even if we did know it would not bring them back.'

Allen, a mechanic, was convicted after a jury found he held a naked flame to items of clothing hanging in a wardrobe in the children’s room.

The 
defendant, who kept some belongings in the younger children's room, was 
preparing to light a cannabis pipe or ‘bong’ when he started the fatal 
fire.

Miss Smith allowed teenagers to smoke cannabis in an outside building known as ‘the chamber’, the court heard.

She was alerted by Allen running downstairs shouting ‘Fire!’, at which Reece went to try to rescue his siblings.

Smoke alarms had been fitted on the 
stairs, but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire 
because one or both ‘kept making beeping noises’.

Allen denied starting the fire, saying he was looking for a friend upstairs when he noticed an ‘orange glow’ under the door.

But police were immediately suspicious, knowing he had been the only adult upstairs at the time.

It
emerged that Allen had set fires as a schoolboy and was known to 
police. A friend told the trial how the pair would regularly start 
fires.

Yesterday the family paid tribute to 
the emergency services who tried to save the siblings and fought to 
bring Dyson Allen to justice.

Michelle's,
whose four children had three different fathers, was biting back tears 
as the man who took their lives was brought to justice.

The
family statement said: 'We are pleased that DA has been convicted of 
the manslaughter of our beautiful children, Reece, Holly, Ella and 
Jordan. We still do not know why our children were taken away from us. 
Even if we did know the answer it would not bring them back.

'He
had every chance to explain his actions to the police and while giving 
evidence in court. He lied from the very beginning and continued to the 
every end.

'We would like to pay tribute 
to Reece. He paid the ultimate price in trying to rescue his brothers 
and sisters. For that we are eternally grateful and very proud.'

Mr
Justice Males said a lengthy custodial sentence is 'inevitable' for 
Allen and adjourned the sentence for the preparation of a psychiatric 
report.

After the case, 
Detective Chief Supt Dermott Horrigan said: 'This has been one of the 
most tragic and significant cases that Lancashire has seen for a number 
of years, which has left a family and a community devastated by their 
loss.

'Four innocent people
died as a result of the actions of this man, who has shown no remorse 
and lied throughout the investigation and court case.

'There
were plenty of opportunities for Dyson Allen to admit his guilt, yet he
persisted with his denial causing the family even further anguish and 
the ordeal of not only having to sit through a trial, but to stand up 
and give evidence as well.

'Officers
from across the force worked tirelessly on what was an incredibly 
tragic and difficult investigation to bring this case to court.

'I
would also like to recognise the bravery of all those friends and 
associates, of both the family and the defendant, who had the courage to
come forward and give evidence, which I know was not an easy thing to 
do.'
