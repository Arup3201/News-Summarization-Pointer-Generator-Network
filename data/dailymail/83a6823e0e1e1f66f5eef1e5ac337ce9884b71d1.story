A former head concierge who worked at some of London’s most exclusive hotels including The Savoy has been jailed for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old schoolgirl.

Ward Giroux, 49, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after a judge heard how he had become 'sexually besotted' with the youngster.

The father-of-three had looked after the rich and famous at top hotels including The Savoy and The Waldorf for more than two decades during his successful career.

Ward Giroux, former head concierge who worked at some of London's most exclusive hotels including The Savoy has been jailed for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old schoolgirl

A judge heard how the married church-goer had been trusted by his young victim’s parents when he first groped her in his car under the pretence of giving her a massage.

He later molested the girl in a similar way in the kitchen of his detached £600,000 Surrey home while members of his own family were also in the four-bedroom property.

The court was told that in a sinister development, Giroux later crept into a room where the girl was trying to sleep - while another girl slumbered yards away - and put his hand inside her clothing.

She finally told her parents about what was going after she had turned 13 years of age.

The last straw came when she went to a supermarket with him and before going in he told the girl - 36 years his junior - that she should pretend to be his girlfriend and stuck his hand inside her top and groped her breast.

Prosecutor Alisdair Smith told Guildford Crown Court: ‘He was arrested. He accepted he was sexually attracted to her but denied the sexual contact.’ 

Before he realised police were involved, Giroux sent the girl a text message apologising and telling her he would not do it again.

Mr Smith said Giroux had been alone with the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, because he would sometimes drive her to and from events.

The four charges he admitted related to incidents between April 2012 and January this year.

Giroux, of Chaldon, Surrey, explained in an interview in May 2010 how he began his career in the hotel industry as a linen porter, then a luggage porter at The Savoy where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey runs a restaurant.

He then moved to The Royal Lancaster Hotel where he decided to become a concierge.

Giroux later worked as head concierge at The Savoy for almost three years as well as at the Jumeirah Carlton and The Waldorf.

He ended up at The Kensington in 2009 where he was employed until earlier this month.

Saul Herman, defending, began his mitigation by expressing Giroux’s remorse for the shame he had brought on his victim and on his own wife and children.

He said of the offences themselves that the contact was 'fleeting' or 'minimal', adding: ‘These were not situations that he had instigated.’ 

The defendant’s family situation had to be assessed in light of what had happened to see if he should be allowed to remain with his own children.

Officials decided there was no risk to them, said the defence barrister.‘He is unlike some of the offenders for these sort of offences,’ said Mr Herman.

‘He is not socially isolated - he has the support of his family and continues to have the support of his church.’

Guildford Crown Court heard he became sexually besotted with the girl and allowed his interest in her to become 'completely inappropriate'

At the sentencing on Wednesday, Judge Suzan Matthews QC told Giroux: ‘You expressed your remorse from a very early stage and I give you full credit for your pleas of guilty which spared the girl and her family from having to give evidence.’ 

She said she had read numerous supporting character references from family, friends and former colleagues, who expressed their surprise at his situation.

‘You were regarded as hard-working and loyal and a supportive member of the family and someone people had respect for.

‘She was a young girl. She must have been very perplexed and puzzled why you were showing this kind of attention to her.

‘This is a case of a clear breach of trust by an adult in a position of control over a young girl.

‘It seems to me you became sexually besotted with her and allowed your interest in her to become completely inappropriate and to cross boundaries which are clearly there and you knew were there.’ 

She rejected a Probation Service recommendation and suggestion by the defence of a community penalty and instead passed an 18-month jail term on each of the three counts of sexual assault on a girl under 13 and a further 18 months for sexual assault on a girl aged 13.

All four terms were ordered to run concurrently.

The judge described the case as “a very sad outcome” and told Giroux: ‘Your Christian conscience will tell you to accept your punishment.’
