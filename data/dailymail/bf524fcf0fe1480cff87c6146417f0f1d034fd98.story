If you're wanting an alternative hotel, this could be it - after a married couple transformed a battered old horse box into a plush room on wheels.

The 1975 Bedford TK lorry had been rotting in a field for a decade before they bought it for about £2,000 and turned it into a £135-a-night bolthole.

Yvonne, 54, and Gary Harris, 46, renovated the lorry themselves, kitting out the box with a kingsize bed, sofa bed, kitchen and wood-burning stove.

Unusual: The 1975 Bedford TK lorry had been rotting in a field for a decade before a couple bought it for about £2,000 and turned it into a £135-a-night bolthole

In the sunshine: The couple had planned to use their creation themselves for romantic escapes, but it proved so popular with friends they have turned it into a business

Popular: The box - which the couple have named Ges - has been such a hit that it is now booked up for three months in advance

Looking out: The side of the box folds down to create a sundeck and it even comes with a converted horse trailer with a walk-in shower, toilet and wash basin

Bedtime: The box is based in a wildflower meadow in Chiddingfold, Surrey, but can be driven to anywhere within a 40-mile radius for special occasions

The pair wanted to use the creation for their own romantic escapes, but it proved so popular with friends they have turned it into a booming business.

The landscape gardeners' horse box - which the couple have named Ges - has been such a hit that it is now booked up for three months in advance.

It is based in a wildflower meadow in Chiddingfold, Surrey, but can be driven to anywhere within a 40-mile radius for special occasions.

Ges is the latest addition to a host of unique places to stay managed by Bristol-based holiday company Canopy and Stars.

Beautiful view: The battered old horse box was turned into a plush hotel room on wheels by the married couple who work as landscape gardeners

Cosy: The box 'had spent 10 years lying dormant in a farmer's field with brambles growing through it', according to Mrs Harris

Three years on: Mr Harris had an idea in September 2011 to buy a horse box that could be converted 'into a sort of retro motorhome'

Retro: Neither Mr Harris nor Mrs Harris had any experience of carpentry but they are 'both perfectionists' and said they learned as they went along

Stained glass window: Since the couple began to start renting out Ges, it has been so popular that people are 'booking three months in advance'

Mrs Harris said: ‘It all started in September 2011 when Gary came home one day saying he had a crazy idea to buy a horse box that we could convert into a sort of retro motorhome.

'It was battered and rusty and still smelled of horses, and had spent 10 years lying dormant in a farmer’s field with brambles growing through it'

Yvonne Harris

‘We wanted to have something we could use as an escape from our hectic landscape gardening jobs, but when Gary took me to see this horse box I was less than impressed.

‘It was battered and rusty and still smelled of horses, and had spent 10 years lying dormant in a farmer’s field with brambles growing through it.

‘However it was very mechanically sound and Gary was adamant this was the one for us and so I went along with it. As soon as we got it home I started to fall in love with it.

‘There was something really magical about it. Converting it into a motorhome was a huge job to take on but something we wanted to do for us.

‘We started work on it the following March. Neither of us had any experience of carpentry but we are both perfectionists and learned as we went along.

In development: Mrs Harris said her husband Gary was 'adamant this was the one for us' when they found the battered old horse box

Painting: Canopy and Stars described Ges as 'horsebox turned off-grid house on wheels, with a door that drops down to make a sun-trap deck'

Away from work: The couple wanted to have something they could use as 'an escape from our hectic landscape gardening jobs'

Hoover: The couple - whose horse box has come a long way since these construction photographs - said that 'everyone who stays in it falls in love with it'

‘Two months later it was finished. We used it to chill out in it a few times and then some friends asked if they could stay in it.

'Ges is unique – a horsebox turned off-grid house on wheels, with a door that drops down to make a sun-trap deck'

Rebecca Whewell, Canopy and Stars

‘Friends of those friends then said they would like to use it and we thought “hang on, we might have a business here”.

‘We have now decided to start renting Ges out and it has just gone crazy – it is so popular that we’ve got people booking three months in advance.

‘I think people love it because it has an amazing feel to it. Everyone who stays in it falls in love with it. I guess we are victims of our own success – but we’re not complaining.’

Rebecca Whewell, of Canopy and Stars, added: ‘Ges is unique - a horsebox turned off-grid house on wheels, with a door that drops down to make a sun-trap deck.

‘The hay has gone, and in its place there’s a great supply of picnic kit like hampers and blankets, so you can set off on foot to find your perfect wildflower meadow.’
