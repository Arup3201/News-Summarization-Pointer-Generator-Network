The robotic submarine being used in the hunt for missing Malaysain Airlines flight MH370, has completed its first full scan of seabed in the remote Indian Ocean.

The U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 underwater drone spent 16 hours at a depth of 4.5km some 2,000km west of the Australian city of Perth.

Analysts are now examining the data it collected in the hope of finding any sign of the aircraft which disappeared from radar screens on March 8 with 239 people aboard.

The Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, has completed its first successful mission in the hunt for missing MH370

The autonomous underwater drone spent 16 hours scouring the seabed at a depth of 4.5km

The device was loaded back onto the deck of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield, where its data was downloaded before it was put back to work again

'Bluefin-21 has searched approximately
 90 square kilometres to date and the data from its latest mission is 
being analysed,' the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, the body running 
the search, said in a statement.

The depth of the search area is at the very limit of Bluefin-21's operational capabilities and two previous missions had to be aborted due to technical problems.

A
 sample taken from an oil slick in the same area, some 2,000 km (1,240 
miles) west of the Australian city of Perth, is also being analysed. 
Authorities believe that is the most likely area where the missing jet 
hit the ocean after disappearing.

A
 series of 'pings' recorded earlier this month have led searchers to the
 remote stretch of ocean in the belief that the signals may have come 
from the plane's black box recorders.

However,
 with no pings received in more than a week and the black box's battery 
now 10 days past its approximate expiry date, authorities are relying on
 the drone.

The introduction of the Bluefin marks a methodical, slower paced new phase of the search, now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, as the most expensive in aviation history

On Monday, the 
search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said the 
air and surface search for debris would likely end in three days as the 
operation shifted its focus to the largely unmapped area of ocean floor.

However,
 authorities said on Thursday up to 10 military aircraft, two civil 
aircraft and 11 ships would still search an area totalling about 40,000 
square km. That would suggest searchers, under pressure from the 
families of those on board the plane, still hold some hope of finding 
floating wreckage.

Australian
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott was quoted by The Wall Street Journal on 
Wednesday as saying that 'We believe that (underwater) search will be 
completed within a week or so. If we don't find wreckage, we stop, we 
regroup, we reconsider'.

Asked
 to clarify Abbott's comments to the newspaper, his office said he was 
only suggesting that authorities may change the area being searched by 
the Bluefin-21 drone, not that the search would be called off.

'They've
 been looking for 40 days and haven't found anything floating yet,' 
Geoffrey Dell, Associate Professor of Accident Investigation and 
Forensics at Central Queensland University, told the Reuters news 
agency.

'You'd have to start saying there's either nothing to find or let's move elsewhere,' he said.

As
 well as the Bluefin-21, authorities are relying on daily modelling of 
ocean currents provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation's (CSIRO) Marine and Atmospheric Research unit, 
which may give clues about how any surface debris may have dispersed.

'People
 are spending a lot of their time at the moment looking at the daily 
models to provide updates,' Nick Hardman-Mountford, the CSIRO's 
principal marine scientist, told Reuters.

'The
 winds, ocean currents, the time and cyclones passing through, they can 
all have an influence on what the ocean currents are doing and the model
 has to be able to capture all of this,' Hardman-Mountford said.

Houston
 has hinted that the search, although not yet over, may already rank as 
the most expensive in aviation history, although authorities are yet to 
put even an approximate price tag on it.
