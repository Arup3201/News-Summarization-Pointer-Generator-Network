Customers are going nuts for the latest pastry delicacy – squirrel pies. Family firm Something Nice is selling 150 of the unusual snacks a week.

Owner Phil Walmsley, 46, said his wife Katherine, 53, came up with the idea after the business began producing pies with exotic fillings a year ago.

He added: ‘We started with kangaroo, crocodile, elk, buffalo and wagyu beef. We found a niche in the market. There are plenty of grey squirrels – they’re classified as vermin and it’s legal to kill them.

'Gamey': Phil Walmsley, 46, hunts the squirrels himself, then sells his pies for £2.50 each

Unusual: Mr Walmsley's company, Something Nice, also makes elk, buffalo and crocodile pie

‘In a pie, it has similar characteristics to rabbit – it is a dark meat and very gamey. People come back for more because it has an excellent flavour – deep and rich.’

Squirrel pie was a delicacy in Victorian times and may be enjoying a revival because of attempts to save the grey squirrels’ less aggressive red cousins from extinction.

Mr Warmsley, who shoots the squirrels and sells the pies for £2.50, said: ‘Killing more grey squirrels could give the red squirrel a chance to repopulate.’

'You do get the odd person who asks how I can do this to such a lovely 
creature, but being at the top of the food chain we have the luxury of being able to eat what we want and they are vermin.'

The snack won a gold award for the firm, of Old Dalby, Leicestershire, at the British Pie Awards.
