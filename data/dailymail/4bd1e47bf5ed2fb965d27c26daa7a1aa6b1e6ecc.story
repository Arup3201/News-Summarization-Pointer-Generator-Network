A mother who lost her looks and was given an Asbo after a five-month raucous drinking binge at her house has admitted that alcohol has ruined her life.

Rebecca Proctor, 28, who blames her transformation from fresh-faced young woman into haggard neighbour from hell on heavy drinking after her father died from a heart attack, says it has cost more than her looks.

Today the mother of one said she had lost her only son as well as her home in Burnley, Lancashire, as a result of her two-bottles-a-night bingeing, and vowed to change her life for the better.

Proctor, a former factory worker who is now sleeping on friends' sofas, said: 'I've lost everything and it's down to my drinking.'

She said she had sought help to 
tackle her drinking problem and told the Sun: 'I want to get my son back
and get myself a part-time job.Â  That is what hurts me the most because
I love him so much.'

Drinks company Lambrini, manufacturers of Proctor's favourite perry, said: 'There appear to be many issues and factors contributing 
to Ms Proctor's case. We always recommend that alcohol is consumed 
responsibly within the daily unit guidelines.

The firm said Lambrini was not solely responsible for Proctor's problems, saying that she consumed a wide range of alcoholic drinks, of which Lambrini was just one.

Proctor, who was given an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) last month and barred from her regular haunts including shopping centres, was evicted from her terraced house after neighbours complained that she held all-night parties.

But today she insisted she hadn't 
been partying but simply watching soap operas and drinking with her 
boyfriend and another friend.

She also said the police mugshot 
which showed the shocking toll alcohol had taken on her previously 
youthful looks had actually been taken a year earlier when she was the 
victim of domestic violence.

If Proctor, a mother of one, returns to her old house and causes further distress to neighbours she could be jailed for up to five years.

After: She became addicted to drinking Lambrini and other types of alcohol during her binge sessions

Reedley Magistrates' Court in Burnley imposed the 
order after hearing that she was 'repeatedly responsible for causing 
noise nuisance and displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour'.

Proctor's former neighbours welcomed the decision to evict her from the area, describing how she would keep them awake with parties which went on for up to five days at a time.

One said: 'It's an absolute total relief to the neighbourhood that she's gone, and it's fair to say we've had our first peaceful night's sleep in ages.

'Rebecca was nothing but a drunk and a terrible drunk at that. She may look as though butter would not melt in some of her pictures but the reality was she was nothing but trouble.

'She would have three or four blokes around every weekend and they would be sat there drinking for England and taking drugs. It was disgusting.

'When she first moved in she was alright and I tried to help her. I even mended her child's bike and helped her out with odd jobs. But then she lost it and her true colours shone through ever since.

'Sadly it was the drink which took over her life and she's been a constant source of problems round her. It was parties every weekend and we couldn't sleep. It would just be noise from them shouting more than noise from music.

'Sometimes it was just a couple of them, and sometimes it was four or five people and they would be out here in front of our house and in the street drinking and taking drugs.

'Sometimes she would be downstairs with people having a party when her child was upstairs. It was nightmare living next door to her.'

The 52-year-old woman, who gave evidence at Proctor's Asbo hearing, added: 'Sometimes parties would go on from Thursday until Monday. They would sleep in the day when we're at work and in the night be all shouting and drinking.

'I believe she is seeking treatment for her alcohol abuse and she says she has managed to curb her drinking - but only from two bottles of Lambrini a day to one and a half.'

Natalie Whittaker from Lancashire Police said after the case: 'This Asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by Rebecca Proctor.

'They had really had enough and I hope that this result will enable them to sleep without disruption.

'I hope this sends out a clear message that police and other agencies will not tolerate this type of behaviour and will take firm action against those involved in anti-social behaviour.'
