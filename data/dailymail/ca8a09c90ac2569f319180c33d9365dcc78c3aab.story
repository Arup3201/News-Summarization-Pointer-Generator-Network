James and Hoa Titcombe launched a campaign after their son Joshua died at Furness General Hospital

Investigators probing failings at a scandal-hit hospital are looking into the deaths of more than 50 mothers and babies.

An inquiry into the NHS trust running Furness General Hospital in Cumbria was first ordered last year by ministers following fears over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies.

But having reviewed more than 200 deaths between 2004 and 2013, some 50 cases have now been identified for a more detailed investigation before a full report is released before the end of the year.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt ordered the inquiry in September last year following a campaign by James Titcombe, whose baby son Joshua died at Furness General in 2008 following an infection.

Mr Titcombe, a former nuclear engineer who now works as a national safety adviser for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), told the Nursing Times: ‘It is really worrying that there are about 50 cases where they have sufficient concerns to examine cases further.

‘I am pleased with the way the inquiry is operating. They are interviewing the right people and it seems to be a very thorough process with no stone left unturned.’

The inquiry was also set up to address concerns that health regulators at the CQC covered up their failure to act on concerns about maternity care at the University Hospitals of Morecombe Bay Foundation Trust.

Each case involves the deaths of mothers in or after labour, still births or the deaths of newborns which are now being examined.

The inquiry is due to resume interviews next week following a break during the summer.

It is being led by Dr Bill Kirkup, a former deputy chief medical officer, part of the Hillsborough and Savile inquiries. 

He has asked former health secretaries to give evidence, having already heard from Sir David Nicholson, a former chief executive of the NHS and Cynthia Bower, a former chief executive of the CQC.

The inquiry is holding its hearings in private but is due to publish its findings in November. 

Morecombe Bay Trust is already facing at least 30 negligence claims brought by bereaved parents and family members claiming sub-standard care.

An internal review by the trust uncovered concerns about the maternity unit in March 2010.

It highlighted poor training of midwives, and a 'dysfunctional' relationship between staff.

However, CQC inspectors failed to read the report and later that year visited the hospital, ruling it was 'safe'.

In October 2011 leaked figures revealed the trust had the highest mortality rate in the UK, with 600 'excess deaths' in the previous four years.

Three grieving families contacted the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2011 fearing that more lives would be lost unless the hospital was investigated.

The deaths of Nittaya Hendrickson, 35, her son Chester, Alex Brady and Joshua Titcombe all occurred within three months at the hospital.

In December the ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor published her findings which concluded there was a series of major failings by midwives may have contributed to the deaths.

In the case of baby Joshua Titcombe, who died in November 2008 when he was nine days old, the report highlighted he would have had a 90 per cent chance of survival had he been given antibiotics.

Midwives assumed his temperature was low because the room was cold - when he was actually suffering a serious chest infection.

He was left in the hands of a junior maternity assistant whose other tasks included serving up patients’ food.

The report also found that Nittaya Hendrickson and baby Chester died in July 2008 after midwives failed to carry out crucial checks despite knowing the birth would be high risk.

Mrs Hendrickson was diabetic and midwives should have checked the baby’s heart every five minutes but they didn’t even do this every 15 minutes as would happen in a normal labour.

And it found that Alex Brady was stillborn in September 2008 after midwives failed to intervene quickly when his mother got into difficulties and did not monitor the baby’s heart.

One, referred only as ‘midwife C’, was involved in another baby’s death in 2004 in which she was found to have again failed to checked the heart rate.
