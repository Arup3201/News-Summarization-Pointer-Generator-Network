There is no connection between the development of autism with childhood vaccinations, University of Sydney researchers recently found.

The first systematic international review was conducted for the research involved more than 1.25 million children for five cohort studies and a further 9920 for five case-controlled studies.

Results from both showed that there was no statistical data to support a link between commonly-used vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough and the development of autism or autism spectrum disorders.

No evidence to link the development of autism with childhood vaccines, according to recent research by University of Sydney

The Sydney Medical School's associate professor Guy Eslick said these vaccines were the ones which had received the most attention by anti-vaccination groups.

'A rising awareness of autism cases and the claimed but not proven link to childhood vaccinations has led to both an increased distrust in the trade between vaccine benefit outweighing potential risks and an opportunity for disease resurgence.'

'This has in recent times become a major public health issue with vaccine-preventable diseases rapidly increasing in the community due to the fear of a 'link' between vaccinations and autism.'

Professor Eslick said this was particularly concerning given the fact that there were 11 measles outbreaks in the US since 2000 and NSW also saw a spike in measles infections in 2012.

'Vaccine-preventable diseases clearly still hold a presence in modern day society, and the decision to opt out of vaccination schedules needed to be urgently and properly evaluated,' he said.

The professor added that to date, there had been no quantitative data analysis of any relationship between autism, autism spectrum disorders and childhood vaccinations.

'Our review is the first to do so, and we found no statistical evidence to support this idea,' he said.

'Furthermore, our review found the components of the widely-used vaccines (thimerosal or mercury), nor the measles, mumps and rubella combination vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or an autism-spectrum disorder.'

The increase in parents deciding not to vaccinate their children has substantially decreased 'herd immunity' among populations, subsequently increasing the risk of catching potentially more serious infectious diseases, the professor also added.

'The risks incurred by not immunising a child is increasing substantially as the level of immunisation coverage in the population falls,' he said.

'The data consistently shows the lack of evidence for an association between autism, autism spectrum disorders and childhood vaccinations, regardless of whether the intervention was through combination vaccines (MMR) or one of its components, providing no reason to avoid immunisation on these grounds.'

The results were published in the medical journal Vaccine.
