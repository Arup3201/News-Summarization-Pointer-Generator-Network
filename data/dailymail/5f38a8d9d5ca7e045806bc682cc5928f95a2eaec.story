Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

KNEEMAR NEYMORE

That challenge on Neymar, which fractured a vertebra in his spine, was done with only one thing in mind – to hurt him.

With no chance of getting hurt himself and the referee in a difficult position to see any tackle, Colombia's Juan Zuniga kneed Neymar in the lower back and kidney area to get him out of the game.

A blow to that area hurts, believe me.

Massive loss: Brazil will be without their start man Neymar after this tackle ended his World Cup

End of the line: Neymar is carried down the tunnel with his World Cup over

Pain: The challenge left Neymar writhing on the ground and a out of the remainder of the tournament

VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots

Mistakes: David Luiz may have scored a stunning free-kick against Colombia but defensively he is a danger

It will be a big blow for Brazil to lose their one and only player with real Samba flair and I very much doubt they can go on to win the World Cup without him.

I'm still waiting for David Luiz to make that game-changing mistake which costs the team. And without Neymar they will have no-one to save him.

BRUISING BRAZIL

Brazil have been getting a lot of stick for their aggressive, tough-tackling performances in this tournament.

In the old days, their pacey attacking full backs would be up and down the flanks, overlapping, their socks around their ankles and too tight shorts.

Brazil have always been very competitive, very tenacious and full-on, but the difference is they always had players with proper passing ability that could entertain - and at times mesmerise - which they are lacking now.

Reducer: Fernandinho was notable for his hatchet job on star Colombian James Rodriguez on Friday night

Decent dogs: Luis Gustavo, Fernandinho (both left) and Paulinho (right) are a solid, unspectacular midfield

Instead, they have a pack of decent dogs in their central midfield, quick into the tackle, incisive and destructive.

They've played Luiz Gustavo, Fernandinho and Paulinho in their defensive midfield duo in this World Cup and, although people are complaining about their aggressive attitude and style of play, it's got them to the semi-final so far.

VAN GAAL'S GAMBLE KRUL ON COSTA RICA

I see some people have questioned Louis Van Gaal's gamble to put Tim Krul in for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica.

They have been saying what about the other goalkeeper? How's it going to affect his confidence? How's it going to affect him for the next round?

Krul ending: The Holland substitute keeper came on to save twice during the penalty shoot-out

Big call: Van Gaal made a brave decision and he was rewarded with a place in the World Cup semi-finals

Quite right: Questions have been asked about the effect on Cillessen but a manager can't think like that

When you're a manager, you can't ever have that frame of mind, you can’t choose not to make a decision because it might upset someone. How ridiculous would that be?

Krul's record, as we all know now, isn't great on penalties. Before that game he'd stopped just two of 20.

But the Costa Rican players would've taken note of the change of keeper and they would no doubt have wobbled, knowing that he's been put in especially for this decisive part of the match.

Anyone who is questioning Van Gaal – you must be mad.

FAREWELL FELLAINI

Marouane Fellaini is not a Manchester United player.

I'm sure Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie would've been shaking their heads when he walked through the door last year.

He is nasty, he is horrible to play against and he hurts people.

Make no mistake, he can be very, very effective. He is good at attacking and defending set plays and is strong in a very direct style of play.

Out of place: Fellaini can be effective but he is too niggly to be a Manchester United player

But that is not Manchester United.

I can't think for one moment that Fellaini would be at all bothered if Van Gaal called him into his office when he's back from the World Cup and said, 'You're not for me, you can leave.'

I'm sure Fellaini would smile, shake his hand and say no problem.

He will be sitting on a treasure chest of money owed to him. I'm sure he's wealthy already, but with players' contracts the signing on fees would have to be paid.

Money talks: If Louis van Gaal wants to get rid of the Belgian it will cost a lot to end the long-term contract

If they really do want him out, he and his agent can negotiate a settlement on his contract and salary owed which will make him a very, very rich young man.

My week...

We started pre-season training last Thursday at Barnet and for the first time in 17 years of football management I've got barely any staff.

Two players called Graham Stack and John Nurse are helping me here and there with the training.

Both blokes are proper men, who've had good careers and have maximised the football ability that they were blessed with.

Helping out: Goalkeeper Graham Stack is helping out with the coaching this season at Barnet

They've had promotions, they've had ups and downs and they are both good family people.

I've gambled on having less staff so that their potential wages can go to bringing in new players and paying better wages

The only other staff member I've got is a young physio called Jade from the youth team.

At the end of the day, you can have the best coach, the best assistant manager, the best analysts, the best sports scientists, the best training ground and the best pair of boots, but if your players are rubbish it's all worth nothing.

My old boss Harry Redknapp always, always said it's all about players and getting good players in.

Now the challenge is to get two or three more in so that the next 10 months will be special.
