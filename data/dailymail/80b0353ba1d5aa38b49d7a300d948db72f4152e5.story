A woman whose SAS sergeant husband has been jailed for keeping a gun as a war trophy has made a heartfelt plea to David Cameron begging for his release.

In a letter, mother-of-two Sally Nightingale urges the Prime Minister to give her five minutes of his time in return for the 17 years of service her husband Danny has given to the Army.

She writes: ‘My husband is a good man, a loving father and a loyal servant to his country. He should not be locked away behind bars.’

Sally Nightingale, who has written to the Prime Minister asking him to end the 'injustice' of her husband's sentence, is pictured outside the detention centre today where he is imprisoned

Sergeant Nightingale, 37, a Special 
Forces sniper who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was sentenced to 
18 months in military detention after admitting owning a 9mm Glock 
pistol.

The weapon was a gift from a group of 
Iraqis he helped train in 2007.

He left it behind with other possessions
when he left Iraq and it was then put in a container and sent to SAS 
headquarters in Britain and then to his home.

He had planned to pass the gun to his 
SAS regiment as a trophy but forgot he had it after suffering brain 
damage following a collapse on a charity trek in Brazil.

Mrs Nightingale, 38, who visited her 
husband in detention for the first time yesterday, said that because his
Army pay has stopped she could face eviction from the home she shares 
with their daughters, Mara, five, and Alys, two, because her salary from
her job with Weight Watchers is not enough to pay the rent.

In her letter to the PM she says: ‘He 
was prepared to sacrifice everything if he was ever required to do so.

'I
am now asking you for five minutes in return for his years of service. 
Your intervention can end his detention.’

Sergeant Nightingale has attracted wide support from senior military figures and MPs.

Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, 
his former SAS commander, said the court martial sentence should be 
overturned, adding: ‘This is a total betrayal of a man who dedicated his
life to the service of his country.’  Conservative MP Patrick Mercer 
condemned the sentence as a ‘gross miscarriage of justice’.

And fellow Tory Julian Brazier, a 
former SAS reservist officer who has secured a Commons debate on 
Sergeant Nightingale for tomorrow, said he had been ‘treated very 
badly’.

Sergeant Nightingale was detained at 
Colchester Military Corrective Training Centre in Essex earlier this 
month. His wife visited him there yesterday and after a two-hour meeting
said: ‘It was lovely to see him but he looks drained.

‘He has been hung out to dry and the 
family have as well.

He has been made an example of for illegal weapons 
coming into the country. But Danny has not brought the weapon into the 
country.’

Mrs Nightingale, who is allowed to see
her husband for four hours a fortnight, making the 700-mile return trip
from her home in Crewe, Cheshire, added: ‘All I want now is justice for
my husband and a future for my family and I will not stop fighting 
until we get it.

‘We want Danny out as soon as possible and for the kids’ sake, we hope it is in time for Christmas.’

On finishing his sentence, he will be discharged from the Army and will have a criminal record.

An appeal against the sentence and conviction is to be lodged on Wednesday.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister is aware of the letter and will respond in due course.’
