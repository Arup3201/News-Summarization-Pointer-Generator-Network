NFL officials sparked outrage Thursday when it was revealed star Baltimore running back Ray Rice would receive just a two-game suspension after punching his then-fiancee so hard she lost consciousness.

Rice is seen in surveillance footage dragging a limp Janay Palmer from the Revel casino elevator in Atlantic City last February. He's since entered a treatment program and the two are said to be in counseling.

However, the NFL's announcement surprised many since other players have faced far worse punishments, often for non-violent offenses.

Rice will miss the season opener against AFC North champion Cincinnati on Sept. 7 and the Sept. 11 game on Thursday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The 27-year-old Rice has been accepted into a diversion program, which upon completion could lead to the charges being expunged.

As part of his announcement Thursday afternoon, NFL Commissioner Goodell told Rice:

'I believe that you are sincere in your desire to learn from this matter and move forward toward a healthy relationship and successful career.'

Too far? After Janay also apologized for what appeared by most to be her own domestic assault, many accused the Ravens of insensitivity for then tweeting out news of her surprise statement

Rice met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last month after joining the diversion program. Goodell ultimately decided to suspend the running back for two games without pay and fine him an additional game check 'for conduct detrimental to the NFL in violation of the league's Personal Conduct Policy.'

Goodell also wrote, 'Despite the court's decision not to impose criminal punishment, the Commissioner determined, as he advised Rice, that the conduct was incompatible with NFL policies and warranted disciplinary action.

Rice's suspension will begin on Aug. 30. He will be eligible for reinstatement September 12 after the Pittsburgh game. Rice may participate in all aspects of training camp and preseason games.

'It is disappointing that I will not be with my teammates for the first two games of the season, but that's my fault,' Rice said in a statement issued by the Ravens. 'As I said earlier, I failed in many ways. But, Janay and I have learned from this. We have become better as a couple and as parents. I am better because of everything we have experienced since that night. The counseling has helped tremendously.'

Rice has played six years for the Ravens. He is the team's career leader in total scrimmage yards and ranks behind only Jamal Lewis in total yards rushing.
