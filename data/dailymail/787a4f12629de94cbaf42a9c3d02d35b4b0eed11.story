As the Steffon Armitage transfer saga played out this week, another English No 7 was conducting business in his own rough, tough, meticulous manner that could yet see him oust national captain Chris Robshaw ahead of the World Cup.

Will Fraser still doesn't possess a full England cap. A cruel run of injuries has prevented the Watford-born 24-year-old from showcasing his skills on the highest stage, where most believe he belongs.

But he is fit again and as desperate to play for his country as at any stage in his injury-chequered five-year professional career.

'There's a massive desire to play for England,' Fraser said at Saracens' training ground ahead of Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont Auvergne. 'I want to play for England and that's the be all and end all.'

While Armitage has attracted headlines this week for his bid to satisfy the RFU's strict selection criteria — which only permits players playing in England to be selected for the national side — by attempting to sign for Bath from Toulon, it is Fraser who could yet make a late run on Stuart Lancaster's Elite Player Squad.

Whether or not he makes the cut when the squad is announced on Wednesday, Fraser is certain of one thing: he has no intention of turning his back on club or country before his international appetite is sated.

'If I was told if I went abroad I would never play for England I wouldn't go — unless there was no chance of me being picked then maybe I'd consider it,' he said. 'But if I knew I still had a chance to play then I'd stay. 100 per cent.'

Music to Lancaster's ears, no doubt. The England coach is a known admirer and called Fraser into his Loughborough training camp this summer despite another injury-hit year which saw him miss his club's ultimately unfulfilling climax to the season with a complicated ankle fracture.

Fraser showed precisely why with a performance against his England rival Robshaw at the start of the season described by Saracens director Mark McCall as 'high, high class' as the men in black humbled Harlequins 39-0.

Saturday's clash — a repeat of last season's semi-final which saw Sarries crush Clermont 46-6 — is another chance for Fraser to impress Lancaster ahead of Wednesday's EPS announcement.

'If I don't make the EPS squad then I'll just keep plodding along. I know more than most how quickly things can change,' Fraser said.

That last comment is as much a reference to his youngest brother Henry — paralysed from the neck down since 2009 following a diving accident — as it is to his own relatively trivial injury issues.

Henry will be watching proudly on Saturday and big brother added: 'I grew up 10 minutes down the road and whatever happens this will always be my club.'
