A student at Brown university has tested positive for a date-rape drug after drinking alcoholic punch at a party where a female student was allegedly victim of a sex assault.

Tests confirmed the unnamed student had GHB, a colorless, odorless sedative, in their system after an October 17 party where she drank at an event by the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

The female student, who has claimed she was sexually assaulted after drinking at the same party, also drank the punch. Her tests results have not come back yet.

Campus officials at the school in Providence, Rhode Island, warned students about the drug in an email update on the case, reported today by the Providence Journal. 

Margaret Klawunn said the two students felt 'a rapid onset of intoxication'  and 'memory loss for a significant period of time' beyond anything they would expect from the amount of punch they drank.

She went on to warn students about GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate), describing it as 'a colorless, odorless drug that can be hard to detect in a drink... but has a strong sedative effect that is incapacitating.'

The fraternity has been suspended in the wake of the accusations, officially for holding a party with alcohol present without asking permission.

Members of Phi Kappa Psi have angrily denied any involvement in the drugging or alleged assault. In a letter published by the college newspaper, members said they were 'confident 'that in no way did any member of Phi Kappa Psi engage in or perpetrate such atrocious and criminal behavior.'

They said no members of the fraternity have been accused, or criminally charged with sexual assault.

In an earlier announcement, Brown officials wrote: 'The behavior in question, if true, is a violation of the standards of student conduct, Rhode Island criminal law and the values we hold as a community.' 

Students with information about the date-rape drug or the alleged sexual assault have been urged to contact university police.
