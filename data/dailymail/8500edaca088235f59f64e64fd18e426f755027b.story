When Juan Mata slipped through the Chelsea exit, Eden Hazard was quick to assess the situation, spot the opening and explode into action, much as he does on the pitch.

He sought out Jose Mourinho to ask for the No 10 shirt. He wanted to carry the number of his hero, Zinedine Zidane, on his back but he was under no illusions.

Hazard was not expecting Mourinho to transform him into the team’s showman or hand him the licence to play where he liked, absolved of all defensive chores.

Quick mover: Eden Hazard sought out Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho to ask for the No 10 shirt

3 - AC Milan have part-retired the No 3 shirt to honour Paolo Maldini, though either of his sons can wear the number if they grace the club.

6 - Retired by both Milan and West Ham in honour of Franco Baresi and Bobby Moore respectively.

7 - From George Best to Kenny Dalglish, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, it’s a shirt for stars.

10 - The most iconic number in football, made famous by the likes of Pele, Maradona, Zidane and Messi.

For one thing, it is not the way the Chelsea manager operates. For another, Hazard feels the luxury playmaker, the iconic No 10, may be gone for good. Modern football is a blur of pace, mobility and industry.

‘I think football is finished with No 10,’ said the Belgian, formerly known as Chelsea’s No 17. ‘You have to play with two wingers and one striker. No more No 10. When I was young I played No 10, but now I’m a left winger or a right winger. During the game you can change.’

‘When Juan left the club I asked: “Can I take the No 10?” The manager said: “Yes, no problem”. But it’s just a number. If I play the same as last season, it’s not because I have the No 10. I have to do more.

‘I wanted it because it was the number of my idol, Zidane, not when he was at Real Madrid (where he wore No 5) but before in the French League.’ Hazard is shy of the obvious comparisons. Can he emulate Zidane? ‘Maybe one day; maybe one day,’ he smiled.

For all his individual brilliance as a dynamic winger, valued by Chelsea far higher than the £32million they paid when signing him from Lille two years ago, Hazard has rarely wallowed in his status.

He prefers to dazzle on the field and disappear into the shadows. Mourinho has tried to coax more from him, encouraging Hazard to embrace responsibility as one of the outstanding talents in the team, but he is a modest personality.

He does not crave attention like, for example, Cristiano Ronaldo, although he is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the Barclays Premier League and in commercial demand. He has the power to sells tickets, boots, shirts... you name it.

Hazard is the new pack star of FIFA 15 and attempts to do this interview, designed to coincide with its launch, in English. He is trying to speak more in English since his friend and interpreter Demba Ba moved from Chelsea to Besiktas.

‘It’s too much for me, actually,’ replied Hazard, when asked about becoming Chelsea’s answer to Ronaldo or Lionel Messi. ‘I don’t like it. I am not this year better than them. They are here and I am here,’ he says, holding his hands flat, one at head height and one by his chest.

‘I need to work,’ he went on. ‘I am getting closer. I was voted the Young Player of the Year, but I am 23. My first trophy in France was the Young Player of the Year. I was 17. Chelsea is not just one player. It is not only me. We have signed a lot of players. Now we have some good signings like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.

‘Diego can score and that is good for me. Fabregas is one of the best midfielders in the world and we can have the chance to play, not better than last season because we had a lot of good games, but in an offensive style. I think together we can beat every team.’

It started in impressive style at Burnley on Monday. Chelsea went a goal down but turned on the power with three goals in 17 minutes to ease through their first match of the season. It was an ominous display, especially if you are Leicester City, who visit Stamford Bridge today.

‘We did very well,’ said Hazard, who contributed to Andre Schurrle’s great goal at Turf Moor, with a robust dribble from the left, a move which pulled Burnley’s defence out of position and created space. Even so, he is searching for more. ‘I know as soon as a game is finished if I have done well,’ he said. ‘I don’t need people to tell me. I want to achieve perfection. The World Cup was good but not perfect.

‘It could have gone better. I did two good games but it wasn’t enough. In Belgium, people are happy because we have a very good team and lost against Argentina. People are sad because they know we could go further. Sometimes you make one mistake and that’s it.

‘Chelsea last season was not perfect because at the end I was injured. We lost many games at the end and lost our form. The whole season was good but the last months were not good. I need to score more goals. We need to go into a final, to be champions. We lost out in four trophies.”

In demand: Hazard is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the English Premier League

Mourinho’s team lost to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals and finished four points adrift of Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City.

Like many at Stamford Bridge, Hazard points to the 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa in March as the moment when the title challenge ended. ‘When we came back in the coach, everyone was angry,’ he said. ‘Everyone knew how important it was.’

Hazard’s own form faded from its mid-season high, as he played on with a slight Achilles tendon problem. He was Chelsea’s top scorer with 17 goals, but the final four were all penalties. He has not scored from open play since the second in a hat-trick against Newcastle in February.

There was gentle criticism from Mourinho, who said he was not ‘ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team’, and fuelled stories about a return to France with Paris Saint-Germain, but Hazard insists he is happy at Chelsea and enjoys working with the manager.

‘It is a pleasure to play under Jose Mourinho and everything is OK,’ said Hazard. ‘I learn every day. He is a normal coach. He speaks a lot with the players. I like it when the manager speaks a lot with you because it gives you confidence.

‘Sometimes when you lose one game he is sad and he shows other people. You mustn’t smile when you lose. You have to be sad like other perople. You have to win every game.’

So it is on the quest to be Chelsea’s perfect 10.
