Police in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, say Lonnie Hutton, 49, strutted into the Boro Bar and Grill, and tried to have sex with an ATM

A drunk has been arrested on suspicion of trying to have sex with an ATM machine and a picnic table.

Lonnie Hutton, 49, walked into the Boro Bar and Grill in Murfreesboro,  near Nashville, Tennessee, and up to the ATM.

He pulled down his pants and underwear, exposing his genitals, then attempted to have sexual intercourse with the ATM, the arrest report stated.

Responding officers found Hutton, still nude from the waist down, walking around the bar, thrusting his hips in the air.

Officers took Hutton outside and told him to sit at a wooden picnic table, WKRN.com reported.

The report stated he 'exposed himself again and engaged in sexual intercourse with the wooden picnic table'.

Hutton smelled of alcohol, had slurred speech, bloodshot eyes and was unsteady on his feet, police said.

He was charged with public intoxication and booked into the Rutherford County jail on $250 bond.

Hutton is scheduled to appear in court July 1.
