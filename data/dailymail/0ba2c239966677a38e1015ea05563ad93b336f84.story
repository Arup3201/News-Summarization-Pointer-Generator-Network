A 24-year-old British woman who died at a beauty clinic in Thailand had undergone cut-price plastic surgery to increase the size of her bottom, police said.

The woman, named locally as Joy Williams, 24, from London, travelled to Bangkok for the £2,000 buttock augmentation operation on October 14, but her wounds became infected.

She returned to the SP Clinic to have the silicone implants removed and died shortly after the second operation on Thursday night, Police Colonel Chayut Marayard said.  

Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51,  has been accused of negligence after he carried out night-time surgery without a licence.

Doctor Sompob Sansiri, 51, is lead away by police after a 24-year-old British woman died at his clinic while undergoing cosmetic surgery on her tailbone

Investigators believe that Sompob was not authorised to carry out the procedure at the clinic in Bagkok

Doctor Sompob Sansiri claimed to have trained in the U.S. and been practicing since 1998, but he is now facing ten years behind bars

Police said the doctor has been formally detained at the central criminal court, charged with recklessness causing death.

He could face ten years in jail if convicted, but according to police he has insisted he has not broken any laws or deviated from normal surgical procedures. 

Her family were too upset to comment yesterday but friends described Miss Williams, who was born in Lagos, Nigeria, as a 'bright, caring girl'. 

They said she had struggled with self-esteem issued and had previously had an operation on her nose.

One of Miss Williams' friends, who did not want to be named, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'She was a really, really nice girl. She was very friendly and caring. She was always helping her mum with her brothers.

'She was a very bright girl and did well at school. She was a bit shy and quiet and I knew in later years there was something wrong and upsetting her.

'At school she had been bullied over her appearance and she went for surgery on her nose and face. Last time I saw her it was obvious she had had cosmetic surgery. She was fine before, she didn't need to. She was fine the way she was but she just wasn't happy. She had no self esteem and I guess she felt she needed to do it. She was just never happy with herself.'

In December 2009, a former Miss Argentina died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer.

Solange Magnano (right), 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation.

The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care. 

Denise Hendry, wife of former football star Colin Hendry, also died as the result of a liposuction operation in which the surgeon punctured her bowel nine times.

She suffered a heart attack, multiple organ failure and blood poisoning, and spent five weeks in a coma.

She survived the initial operation, but was forced to undergo 18 operations to fix her bowel. 

She died seven years later, aged just 42.

Another former schoolfriend, who also asked not to be named, was in tears when she heard the news.

'I'm in total shock,' she said. 'I just can't believe it. Not Joy. Not her. She was lovely, she was my friend.'

While in Bangkok, Miss Williams was staying at the £11 a-night Vabua Asotel hotel, which is used by the clinic as accommodation for its patients.

Staff at the hotel said she was a quiet resident who had returned from her first operation in her green surgical gown.

It was her third visit to Thailand, officials said, but it is not known if she had surgery when she was there in May 2011 and October 2012.

It is not known if Miss Williams was in Bangkok alone. 

According to investigators, she was also given BodyTite liposuction treatments during her first visit.

BodyTite works by inserting a tube under the skin which melts fat using radio waves before it is sucked out. There is also a plate on top of the skin which smooths the surface.

The clinic charges between £850 and £1,100 for buttock liposuction, which includes all tests and consultations, however it is not yet clear exactly what surgery the victim was being given.

Police and forensic officers were called to the SP Clinic in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday to reports that a woman had stopped breathing.

The officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her.

According to police, there was a three inch-long stitched incision on her tail bone. 

The body was then wrapped in white sheets and six policemen carried it to a waiting ambulance. 

It was taken to the Police General Hospital for a post mortem examination. 

Pol Maj Gen Ittipol Piriyapinyo told reporters that the woman had asked for a corrective procedure to her tailbone area and had visited the clinic before. 

According to reports, the operation had finished when doctors discovered they were unable to revive the woman. 

On the clinic's website, Dr Sompob claims to have studied at Chiang Mai University medical school in Thailand, graduating in 1992. 

According to police the woman had previously had liposuction treatment at the clinic (pictured, medics take her body away from the scene)

Officers rushed to the clinic, in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday, where they found the woman unconscious on the operating table

He also claims to be a member of three other cosmetic surgery societies in America and Korea, and a certified board of two more. 

Young British women are increasingly going to extreme lengths to get the 'perfect' derriere. 

Inspired by the gravity-defying posteriors of celebs like Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian West, more of us than ever are desperate for a bigger booty.

Research from whatclinic.com, a private healthcare search engine, shows enquiries for buttock augmentation surgery have doubled in a year. 

In fact, after photographs of Kim K posing in a tiny gold bikini in Thailand emerged in April, enquiries shot up by 136 per cent.

According to BAAPS (British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) fat transfer operations – where fat is taken from the stomach and thigh area and reinserted in the buttocks – are up 13 per cent.

This is despite the surgery carrying a hefty average price tag of £4,000.

Officers are questioning staff and doctors at the premises, and trying to establish whether the clinic was stocked with the correct life-saving equipment. 

Lardprao police they have notified the British embassy and have sent her body to the Police Institute of Forensic Medicine for autopsy.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We were informed of the death of a British national in Thailand on October 23. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

Thailand is the world-leader in cosmetic surgery tourism, with websites advertising package deals promising procedures at discounts of up to 60 per cent.

While visitors form Australia and the U.S are particularly common, patients have also been known to visit the country from Britain.

The industry earned the country £2.68billion in 2013 alone. Of the 26.5 million people who visited Thailand in 2013, 2.5 million went purely for medical reasons.

That number has been growing at an average of 15 per cent a year over the past decade.

The top procedure in Thailand is dental work, including teeth veneers, though websites advertise beast implants, face lifts, and even hip replacements.

Dr Massimiliano Marcellino, a Harley Street surgeon at CosmeDocs who has performed over 5,000 operations, warned about the dangers of going abroad for surgery. 

Officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her

According to investigators the woman was undergoing her second procedure at the clinic, the first being a BodyTite liposuction operation

Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51, a surgeon at the clinic has been arrested amid claims he was not qualified to carry out the procedure (pictured, officers outside the clinic) 

He said: 'Around a fifth of the correction surgeries I carry out are on patients who need help after visiting clinics overseas - mostly liposuction and facelifts in Eastern Europe.

'There are fantastic surgeons to be found the world over but the problem is the cosmetic surgery industry can be less regulated in some countries - so standards can vary dramatically depending on where you go.

'In the UK, a surgeon's performance is strictly monitored, with routine training and independent yearly appraisals. As with any form of surgery there are risks and it should not be undertaken lightly.'

Dr Bryan Mayou is a plastic surgeon at the Cadogan Clinic, Chelsea, which has been frequented by the likes of Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding.

He brought liposuction to the UK and has since carried out thousands of procedures.

He said: 'Medical tourism is a thing which has been around for a long time. We in London benefit from it, so it is not surprising that people will shop around and often go abroad because it is cheaper.

'We are seeing an increase in the number of patients that are coming to us for corrections following cosmetic surgery abroad.

'At the clinic we have seen a 125 per cent increase in a year, and it can be for all sorts of procedures, but liposuction and breast surgery are the most common.

'If I were looking aboard, even as a surgeon I would find it extremely difficult to know who to trust.

'You have to ask: how is this clinic going to deal with problems? What happens if things go wrong?

'What appears to be a saving, in fact turns out to be anything but.'
