The Canadian parliament's hero Sergeant-at-Arms is soon to get a major promotion after bravely leading the charge against House of Commons shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in October.

Ex-Mountie Kevin Vickers will move on from the already prestigious, though ceremonial, job as parliamentary head of security to become top diplomat to Ireland.

Vickers will end a 35-plus year career as a mountie and security officer to become ambassador, CBC reports.

Promotion: The hero Canadian parliamentary Sergeant-at-Arms will be given the position of Ambassador to Ireland following a selfless show of bravery in which he took down House of Commons invader Michael Zehaf-Bibeau

Vickers will be replace former Conservative MP Loyola Hearn, who's held the position since 2010, according to the Globe and Mail. 

It's yet another in a string of honors the hero has received following his selfless act of bravery October 22. 

Israel's parliament officially honored Vickers in November. 

And the MPs in his own House of Commons gave Vickers a touching standing ovation that was recorded and played countless times around the world in the wake of the shooting and showed the policing veteran nearly in tears. 

At first expressionless and motionless, the 58-year-old Vickers eventually responded to the ovation with a few slight nods of his head, his lips quivering with emotion.

Later in the session, Prime Minister Stephen Harper lauded Vickers, whose job — a mix of the ceremonial and the practical — encompasses the maintenance of safety and security in the Parliament complex.

'I would be very remiss if I did not conclude in acknowledging specifically the work of the security forces here on Parliament and the great work of our sergeant-at-arms,' Harper said to more cheers and applause from the members.

Harper then walked over to shake Vickers' hand and clap him on the shoulder.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday's events,' Vickers said in a statement.

'However, I have the support of a remarkable security team,' he added. 'Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team.'

The gunman who invaded Parliament had been seen by witnesses minutes earlier fatally shooting a soldier posted at the nearby National War Memorial.

As shots rang out in the Parliament building, people fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Video broadcast showed Vickers moments after the gunfire, walking down a corridor in the Parliament building with a handgun in his right hand.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner Bob Paulson said at a news conference that Zehaf-Bibeau and Vickers exchanged gunfire, and the suspect was shot as he moved from behind a pillar to get a better shot at the sergeant-at-arms.

'Mr. Vickers and his whole team are heroes,' Paulson added.

Vickers, whose background includes providing security for visiting members of Britain's royal family, became sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied security career. He spent nearly 30 years with the RCMP, reaching the rank of chief superintendent.

A member of Parliament from Ottawa, Paul Dewar, described the 6-foot-4 Vickers as 'a gentle giant,' and recalled how the sergeant-at-arms had scooped Dewar's young son into his arms at their first encounter.

Dewar said that when Vickers interviewed for the job years ago, he had stressed the importance of striking a balance so that Parliament would be secure yet remain accessible to the public.

'He said, 'I want to make sure people are still able to play Frisbee on the front lawn,'' Dewar recalled.

Daryl Kramp, a Conservative member of Parliament from Ontario, said he counts Vickers as a personal friend, as well as a consummate professional.

'He does his duty in just such a manner that he had earned the respect of all of the House, prior to these events,' Kramp said. 'And then to be able to act so professionally again, and so decisively, in a traumatic situation, that just even gives more credence to not only what his capabilities are, but certainly to what his values and principles are.'

A former RCMP deputy commissioner, Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who also has security duties at Parliament Hill, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that Vickers was a meticulous planner.

Vickers was born in New Brunswick and spent much of his police career there.

His son, Andrew, has carried on the family tradition as a police officer in Miramichi, New Brunswick.

Three years ago, Andrew was lauded in the federal Parliament for diving into the frigid, fast-flowing Miramichi River to rescue a drowning woman who was trying to kill herself.

'We are happy to see Andrew following in the footsteps of his dad,' said the lawmaker who saluted him, Tilly O'Neill-Gordon.

Heartfelt: he MP in the House of Commons gave Vickers a touching standing ovation that was recorded and played countless times around the world in the wake of the shooting and showed the policing veteran nearly in tears.
