A bullet used in AR-15 rifles that is popular with hunters and sports shooters is set to be banned, according to new plans from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this month. 

The 5.56mm green tip bullets will be re-classified as armor-piercing ammunition, meaning they can break through bulletproof vests, effectively prohibiting them from being sold or manufactured for civilian use.

However citizens in possession of the bullets will not face criminal prosecution because they are widely available.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives plans to ban the 5.56mm green tip bullet (pictured) from being sold or manufactured for general public use because of its armor-piercing capabilities 

The sale of armor-piercing bullets to the general public was banned under the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1986, according to the Idaho State Journal. 

The 5.56mm bullets were originally exempt under the law because they were not used in handguns - which the 1986 act specifically targets. 

But, according to the ATF, there has been a recent surge in AR-15 style pistols that are capable of firing the bullet. 

Unlike the standard 5.56mm-caliber ammo, the green tip has a steel penetrator that increases penetration when the bullet hits something.

In the proposal, released earlier this month, the ATF stated the green tip bullet, when loaded into specific cartridges, can be used in a handgun. 

The legislation has not yet been brought into effect. 

Thirty House of Representatives members have signed a letter created by Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte demanding the ATF explain the 'surprise bullet ban,' according to the Washington Examiner. 

'Millions upon millions of M855 rounds have been sold and used in the US, yet ATF has not even alleged - much less offered evidence - that even one such round has ever been fired from the handgun at a police officer,' his letter said. 

An executive director at the NRA said the Obama administration was attempting to ban the AR-15 through ammunition regulation after failing to do so through 'the legislative process'

An NRA executive director said the Obama administration was attempting to ban the AR-15 through ammunition regulation after failing to do so through 'the legislative process'.

The AR-15 was banned under the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which expired in 2004. 

A number of policymakers have tried to reinstate the ban but have been unsuccessful.

President Obama most recently proposed a renewal of the ban following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, but it failed in the Senate by 20 votes in 2013.

In December ten families affected by the Sandy Hook shootings sued Bushmaster, the manufacturer of the AR-15 that was used by Adam Lanza to gun down 20 children and six adults.
