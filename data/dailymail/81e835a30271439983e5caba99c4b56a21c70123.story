Cynical tactics: Charles Saatchi pictured with his daughter Phoebe

Charles Saatchi cynically used his 18-year-old daughter Phoebe in a desperate bid to smear Nigella Lawson over her use of  illegal drugs, The Mail on Sunday can reveal today.

The embittered advertising mogul encouraged his former wife Kay and their daughter to release a damning statement claiming that Ms Lawson had used drugs ‘regularly and heavily each night’ months before her use of cocaine and cannabis was revealed in court.

An explosive document, which was endorsed by Phoebe and Kay, claims:

Ms Lawson has strenuously denied these allegations.

The fresh revelations come as Ms Lawson gives her first interview since her former housekeepers were found not guilty of a £685,000 credit card fraud.

She told The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine that she has ‘toughened up’ in the last year, adding in a statement sent through her publicist Mark Hutchinson: ‘I will survive this and move forward. I just want to focus on family life and work.’

In court earlier this month, Ms Lawson admitted snorting cocaine six times – to help deal with her late husband John Diamond’s terminal illness and when subject to ‘intimate terrorism’ by Mr Saatchi.

She also admitted cannabis use but has categorically denied she was a ‘habitual user’ of drugs.Last night friends of the chef described claims that she used drugs every night as ‘ludicrous’.

Leaking the document to The Mail on Sunday demonstrates the extraordinary lengths to which Mr Saatchi was prepared to go in order to destroy his wife’s reputation.

The sensational statement, partly written by Kay Saatchi – Charles’ second wife – was sent in July, after the now infamous picture of him with his hands around Nigella’s throat emerged, leading to the couple’s divorce.

It begins: ‘I am furious that my daughter, Phoebe, was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of Nigella.’

She adds: ‘[Nigella] tried to involve [my] daughter in this arrangement but she refused, but kept it quiet from her father and [me] until the furore about Nigella and Charles’ relationship.’

The story about Nigella’s alleged ‘drug nights’ was planted on July 12, a fortnight before the couple were divorced, at the start of a sustained campaign against the TV chef orchestrated by public relations executive Richard Hillgrove, who has claimed to be advising Mr Saatchi.

At the time, The Mail on Sunday did not run the contentious statement for legal reasons. But following the trial of former housekeepers, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, it can now be revealed. The girls claimed in court that Ms Lawson was a regular drug user.

The Mail on Sunday received the statement via email following a telephone call from a source close to Mr Saatchi about ‘concerns’ he wanted to air.

The statement was written by an anonymous friend but endorsed by Phoebe, as she confirmed in a phone call where her father was present.

After stating that Ms Lawson tried to involve Phoebe in drug taking, it added: ‘When Phoebe’s father learnt the truth from her, and from the staff in the house who would regularly find evidence, and also in  Nigella’s top floor study each morning, he and Kay were horrified.

‘Kay and Charles learnt that Nigella used drugs regularly and heavily each night, for an hour after dinner, and another hour before bed. It was a large house, and Charles spent his evenings in their bedroom, and couldn’t smell the evidence because they closed the doors to the upstairs and lit scented candles.

'Nigella had also installed an air fragrance distribution system throughout the house. The drug nights grew in regularity till they became a permanent feature in the last year.

'Phoebe believes that was when  Nigella grew distant and cold with her for not joining in. That was also when Nigella’s relationship with her father became distanced and distracted.

‘Nigella additionally had her staff prepare an extra two large versions [of joints], on a daily basis to be left on her desk, for her to consume privately during the night while her husband was asleep.

‘Kay feels that attempting to entice her daughter Phoebe into this druggy world was unforgivable; that she was young and vulnerable to peer pressure.’

The statement went on to say that Phoebe kept the allegations ‘quiet’ until she could see how deeply her father was upset about the break up with Ms Lawson. She then decided to ‘tell both her parents the truth about my stepmother’.

Mr Saatchi told The Mail on  Sunday via email: ‘I feel like an  idiot being the only person in the house who knew nothing about  the drugs. The more details I received from the staff the more betrayed I felt.’

For months, rumours were fed to the media by a fast-talking PR about drug-taking in the Saatchi-Lawson household.

The man behind the storm of rumours circulating online is a former salesman who has made  different claims about his relationship with Charles Saatchi.

New Zealand-born Richard Hillgrove had said he was a ‘behind-the-scenes svengali’ to Saatchi. He claimed to be a valued adviser but also said he was not on the art collector’s payroll.

Hillgrove, who lives in Somerset and favours wearing a Stetson, writes a blog, News Opinion. He posted a series of pieces about Nigella and allegations of her drug taking – and was then threatened with legal action by her lawyers.

In an interview with The Guardian, Hillgrove conceded he had not spoken to Saatchi about the incident at Scott’s restaurant – yet later told journalists he was  a ‘behind-the-scenes svengali’.

But friends close to Saatchi said Hillgrove had simply ‘fed Saatchi fascinating titbits’ of information about Nigella, and was not working for him.

The two only met, they claim, when Hillgrove called Saatchi to say Nigella had threatened him with legal action.

Hillgrove, a former salesman for media giant Northern & Shell, is a self-styled PR guru who also claimed to have represented three  stars of the BBC’s Dragons’ Den.

But Duncan Bannatyne, briefly a client, said he ‘would not recommend him’.

Ms Lawson insisted she was not a 
‘drug addict or a habitual drug user’ and denied ever authorising the 
Grillos’ extravagant purchases, as they had claimed, in exchange for 
them keeping her habit secret.

Mr
 Saatchi also denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in 
which he called his ex-wife ‘Hi-gella’ and accused her of poisoning her 
daughter Cosima, 19, with drugs and ‘trashing her life’.

Last week, police said they would not be taking any action over Ms Lawson over her drug-taking, unless fresh evidence emerged.

When
 she took the stand at Isleworth Crown Court to give evidence against 
her two former aides last week it was clear Ms Lawson felt it was she 
who was on trial.

Forced
 to go into detail about her drug-taking, the 53-year-old spoke of ‘a 
long summer of bullying and abuse’ and singled out a PR blog she said 
had been ‘dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi’s reputation and savaging 
mine’.

In
 that online journal, Richard Hillgrove made a series of intimate and 
defamatory allegations about Ms Lawson before emailing them to 
influential members of the media.

Mr Saatchi denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in which he called his ex-wife 'Hi-gella' and accused her of poisoning her daughter Cosima, 19, with drugs and 'trashing her life'

More
 mysterious, however, is how he became embroiled in the marriage 
breakdown – or came to ‘represent’ Mr Saatchi in such a Machiavellian PR
 campaign.

More 
bizarrely, Mr Hillgrove appeared to be simultaneously working for the 
Grillo sisters. It was he who put their signed statements online before 
the court hearing, although Ms Lawson’s solicitors quickly had them 
removed.

Last
 night Mr Hillgrove refused to make any comment, and Richard Cannon, the
 Grillo sisters’ solicitor, did not return The Mail on Sunday’s call.

The offensive began on July 23, just over two weeks after Charles Saatchi revealed in The Mail on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife.

Mr Hillgrove wrote an account of the now infamous incident outside Scott’s restaurant on June 9, claiming the pictures of Mr Saatchi grasping Ms Lawson around the throat were set up.

The next day Ms Lawson threatened to sue Mr Hillgrove, but he refused to take down the offending material.

On the July 31, Ms Lawson and Mr Saatchi were granted a decree nisi. Two days later, Mr Hillgrove tweeted a link to another blog in which he claimed Ms Lawson had used the pictures to leave a marriage ‘that has been on the rocks for over a year according to sources’.

On August 5, Mr Hillgrove e-mailed the media insisting that the photographs were a ‘slur’ against Mr Saatchi.

In an interview with the Guardian in July this year the publicist said he had not spoken to Mr Saatchi about the incident but by September he was telling journalists he was an unofficial adviser.

And as the Grillo trial approached, Mr Hillgrove’s emails became more sensational. In his final missive on November 11, just 16 days before the start of the court case he wrote: ‘Nigella Lawson can’t hide from years of deception and cocaine abuse.’

Friends close to Mr Saatchi said that Mr Hillgrove had simply fed the art dealer ‘fascinating titbits’ of information about his estranged wife, and was not working for him.

But those who have worked with Saatchi in the past say he is ruthless in the way he cuts people out of his life. One, who did not want to be named, said: ‘If you leave Saatchi and Saatchi you die… you don’t  exist anymore. It’s a bit like Chairman Mao. You’re simply written out of history.’

Was there a grain of truth in  Nigella’s claim that the campaign was designed to savage her reputation? Mr Hillgrove isn’t saying.

Nor has he tweeted or emailed since the trial began, nor since the verdict of not guilty was returned last Friday.
