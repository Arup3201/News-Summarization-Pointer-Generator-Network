Looking pale and exhausted, NSW fast bowler Sean Abbott arrived at St Vincent’s Hospital wearing a black baseball hat at 2.30pm on Thursday.

In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Steve Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders. They were there for him.

He then sat down and had a coffee with his team mates, who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler.

It was Abbott's short-pitched ball that struck Hughes and injured him as he attempted a pull shot. It was a tragically freakish accident.

Abbott and his team mates had been given counselling since the incident took place.

But it wasn't just the cricketers who turned out to give support, and as it turns out, say their goodbyes, to Hughes.  Good mate and boxer Anthony Mundine was one of those who came to see him at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner East.

The first inkling that the worst had happened, that their mate had lost his fight, was when those players and friends who had been gathered in and around the hospital’s coffee shop left en masse to go upstairs to Hughes' bedside at 3pm.

Then, about 45 minutes later, Australian vice-captain Brad Haddin re-emerged downstairs. Weeping and clearly distressed, he was comforted by family and friends.

A shocked looking Ricky Ponting and batsman Steve Smith left the hospital 50 minutes later, while others stayed behind still trying to take in the harsh reality.

It was a Who’s Who of cricket in Australia who came to give comfort to the opening batsman. Michael Clarke barely left his bedside.

A groan went up from the gathered press outside St Vincent's as the shocking news spread.

Players left from various exits of the hospital, some in tears, some being consoled by teammates. Understandably, none of them hung around for any longer than they possibly could such was their shock and grief.

Earlier this morning, former Australian test captain Steve Waugh, 49, was warmly welcomed at the hospital entrance by Aaron Finch, David Warner and Tom Cooper, who was batting with Hughes when the freak accident happened on Tuesday.

No official statement had been released by the hospital. But a hospital source said that this was because there was no further news to give as 'his condition had not changed.'

He was still critical, fighting for his life, and in an induced coma after emergency surgery on Tuesday afternoon.

By 1pm on Thursday, the area beside St Vincent's Hospital's coffee shop was a placed filled with emotional hugs and embraces as Hughes' team-mates and their wives and girlfriends comforted each other.

Players from the Australia squad such as Brad Haddin, David Warner, Steve Smith and Nathan Lyons mingled with Hughes' teammates from the South Australia team as they tried to come to terms with the tragedy.

Players gathered here by Australia's general manager, Pat Howard, before being brought up as a group to visit their stricken teammate and his family at his bedside.

There had still been no official update from the hospital on Hughes' current condition.

Australia coach Darren Lehmann struck a sombre figure as he walked from St Vincent's hospital after spending over an hour with Hughes' family and teammates on Thursday morning.

He left with Australian batsman Aaron Finch who looked similarly downcast.

Both players warmly embraced before going into the hospital, showing clearly how the tragedy has brought the Australian players even closer together.
