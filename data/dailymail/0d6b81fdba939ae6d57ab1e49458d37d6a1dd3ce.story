A luxury car saleswoman has been hailed as one of the world's best after it emerged she had sold more than £13million worth of Bugatti Veyrons in a single year.

Anita Krizsan has sold 11 of the pricey vehicles in the past year at the exclusive Mayfair dealership where she works.

Most Veyron salesmen consider themselves lucky to shift three of the supercars - which have a top speed of 267mph - in 12 months.

But Miss Krizsan seems to have the Midas touch - as well as selling ten Veyrons outright from the Jack Barclay dealership, she joined with a European firm to sell an eleventh.

Luxury: The Hungarian-born saleswoman is an expert at selling the super-luxury vehicles to wealthy clients

But last night she told the Mailonline, just minutes after clinching her latest deal (a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport sold for an eye-watering £1.7million), that being a woman in a traditional man’s world had not been a problem – indeed it can be a positive advantage.

And even when male customers ask her to find a salesmen she says: ’You have to take it as a joke and respond with charm. You can’t blame the customers.’

'This can be cultural, but once they realise I know about the car it breaks down barriers.'

The Hungarian-born sales mastermind's outstanding efforts led to the boss of Bugatti sending her a special Christmas card telling her she was their ‘global benchmark’ in sales.

Miss Krizsan works 24 hours a day dealing with VIP customers around the world, and goes to meet the customers in their home countries when the car keys are handed over.

Her amazing sales exploits are revealed today in Auto Express magazine.

With her £10million a year sales translated into dollars, she has already been nicknamed ‘the $15million woman.’

She told Auto Express: ‘We tend to have two types of customer - collectors and investors.

‘I like to start by talking to them 
about what cars they already have and their general interest. I'm trying
 to find the car that matches their personalities.’

She
 attributes her success to her phenomenal networking skills, which she 
exercises by spending time with the super-wealthy at events such as the 
Goodwood Festival of Speed.

But
 the commission on each car has not brought her trappings of great 
wealth – her company car is a modest black diesel Volkswagen Golf – and 
she lives unostentatiously in West London: ‘I don't drive a Bugatti 
unfortunately. I have a diesel Volkswagen Golf which I love.

'It is very understated and suits my lifestyle. But I wouldn’t say no if one were offered.’

The firm was founded 1909 in the French town of Molsheim, Alsace – then a disputed part of the German Empire until 1919 -  by Italian-born designer and engineer  Ettore Bugatti.

Business declined after Bugatti’s death on August 21, 1947, with manufacturing operations ending in 1952. Several failed attempts followed over decades to revive the marque.

In 1987 Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli acquired the brand and created EB110 sports saloon. Owners included F1 world champion Michael Schumacher, but the firm soon went into liquidation.

Volkswagen AG bought the brand in 1998 and VW boss Dr Ferdinand Piech led the drive to create a supercar fit for the 21st century. Critics were equally impressed and astonished by scale of his ambitions. A small ‘boutique’ factory was set up in grounds of Bugatti’s original home in Molsheim, next to his chateau, to hand-assemble the cars.

Under Volkswagen in 2005, and after a series of prototypes, Bugatti unveiled the small but immensely powerful two seater 8-litre  W14 Veyron EB 16.4 with four-turbochargers  and a price in excess of £1 million. About 80 cars are built a year – most are collected by their owners from the factory.

The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport 16.4 World Record Edition has a top speed of 258mph, accelerates from rest to 60mph in 2.3 seconds, develops 1,200 brake horse power (about the same as 12 ford Fiestas put together), will average just 16mpg and has massive C02 emissions of 539g/km.

She and her bosses declined to talk income – save to say she was on a ‘traditional’ commission-based package.

However, leading luxury car dealers suggest that a ‘batting average’ of around £100,000 a year  would not be wide of the mark.

This is calculated from the dealer’s profit margin on each Veyron  of around £150,000, and the salesman or saleswoman receiving around five per cent to 10 per cent of that profit.

The exclusive hand-built cars are manufactured at a ‘boutique’ factory in the grounds of Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti’s former home at Molsheim in Alsace, France.

'Every customer is invited to the Molsheim factory in France,' she said. 'I like them to feel the history and culture of the car and the story behind it. While we're at the factory they can go for a test drive with Pierre-Henri Raphanel, who will tell them about the car and talk them through it.'

Mr Raphanel is Bugatti’s lead test driver and set the record 267mph top speed in a Veyron Super Sport in 2010.

She studied languages and speaks 
fluent French and Russian – her childhood was spent growing up when 
Hungary was still behind the communist Iron Curtain .

Most
 of Anita's clients are from the Middle-East which sometimes makes 
communication between both parties difficult. Russians pose less of a 
problem.

She moved to the UK 13 years ago to work as an administrator for Honda in Newbury, Berkshire.

But
 her skill at sealing a deal quickly saw her move from Japanese 
hatchbacks to European sports cars before she joined Jack Barclay in 
2011 to sell Bentleys.

Her 
boss Derek Bennett, general manager of the dealership, part of the giant
 HR Owen PLC group,  hand-picked her for the Bugatti job.

He
 said: 'Customers lover her. It’s a big relationship job. She’s put a 
little bit of magic into it. She  understands the customers and puts 
them at ease.'

She was 
quickly moved from Bentleys to Bugattis, which she describes as a ‘piece
 of art’, adding: ‘I always say there are two types of cars in this 
world - Bugattis and other cars.’

Buyers considering a £1million supercar demand high levels of customer service.

‘I have some customers ringing me up at 2am asking about warranties – but they can call me any time,’ she said.

*Prices are pre-tax

Bugatti prices vary from around £1million to £2million each, depending on model, specification, extras, local taxes, and currency exchange rates.

Cars bought for use in the UK, for instance , will carry 20 per cent VAT. Those bought for delivery to a tax haven may carry no tax at all.

Under EU law, tax for cars – and luxury yachts - is paid in the country into which the vehicle  is imported – not where it is purchased.

She
 even goes to every handover - next time, she is heading to Dubai - and 
believes that this is as important as the initial sell.

But even once the car’s handed over, her job isn’t finished: 'Aftersales is key to ensuring customers keep coming back.

'You should call the next day to see if they’re enjoying it or have any questions.’

She explained: 'A child can sell a car once. We want to see them again. We have a Bentley customer from three years ago and we still call to see if they’re OK.'

She’d like to see more female buyers, too. There are currently four female Veyron owners around the world – only one of whom is in the UK.

When dealing with a customer she normally talks to them in the Jack Barclay boardroom, with its original walls and archive invoices from as early as 1928 – a 4.5-litre Bentley back then was £1,396.

'We like to show them things like this as they are normally car enthusiasts anyway,' she said.

Even once they’ve taken delivery, owners can have their cars transported around the world. 'When our customer in Dubai comes to the UK for the summer, we’ll sort out getting his car here – and service it at the same time,' Miss Krizsan explained.

And if any mechanical issues arise, Bugatti’s master technicians take over. ‘We call them the flying doctors,' she said. ‘There are four in the world, and they’ll fly to you if you have a problem.’

Miss Krizsan is hoping to beat her sales record in 2013 by hitting double figures.
