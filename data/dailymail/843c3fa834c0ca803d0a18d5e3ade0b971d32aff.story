Filmmaker Philip Bloom is taking viewers on a thrilling sunset cruise of Chicago – in less than four minutes.

Mr Bloom has produced a timelapse video that shows the heart of the Windy City as a boat sails along its stunning waterfront and its cosy downtown canals.

At hyper speed, the vessel passes famous landmarks as it moves from Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and back.

Skyscrapers: The video gives viewers spectacular views of Chicago's skyline as the sun sets

Chicago's canal system served as a major shipping route for the Great Lakes in North America

With hours of footage condensed into a three-and-a-half hour timelapse, the video begins with the boat departing a marina near McCormick Place, the largest convention centre in North America.

From there, it zips along the lake as Chicago’s skyline glistens in the setting sun. 

After passing Navy Pier, the boat navigates the canals with impressive views of iconic skyscrapers, including the Willis Tower – once the tallest building in the world – and Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Before heading back onto the lake in complete darkness, the boat stops near Navy Pier as fireworks erupt over the lake in brilliant flashes.
