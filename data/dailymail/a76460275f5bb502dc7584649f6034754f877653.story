Celtic have an injury concern over skipper Scott Brown ahead of Saturday's return to Premiership action against Hamilton.

The Parkhead captain will sit out Tuesday's friendly against Sparta Prague in Maspalomas before the champions fly home from their winter break on Wednesday.

Brown sustained a gash to his head in the early minutes of Saturday's opening-game loss to PSV Eindhoven.

He was always scheduled to miss the Sparta clash in any case, with Ronny Deila opting to field his younger fringe players.

Seeking to reel in Aberdeen's four-point lead at the top of the league, Deila wants the midfielder back for the away clash with Accies.

Hedging his bets on the issue, the Norwegian said: 'Scott was feeling it a little bit in his head today and his body. But I don't think it's a big thing.

'He wasn't going to play tomorrow [Tuesday] anyway, so he will just have a couple of days resting.

'I don't have it in my mind that he could be a doubt for Saturday. But you never know.

'Again, that's why I'm wary about him maybe having had a concussion after Saturday's game. That takes time.

'He didn't have that. However, he feels a little bit vulnerable today, so we'll see what's happening. I think he'll be ready for Saturday.'

Defender Mikael Lustig admits the loss of Brown, even for one game, has a negative impact on the team.

'Scott Brown is our captain and a really important player for us,' he said.

'You know when he is playing, he brings something else that maybe we don't have without him.

'But when you are playing for Celtic, everyone has the ability to step up and play an important role.'

Lustig, meanwhile, is close to ending his two-month injury lay-off ahead of a critical period for the Parkhead side.

Returning from a hamstring ailment which led to groin problems, the Swedish international is close to his comeback.

With a League Cup semi-final clash against Rangers and the last-32 Europa League ties with Inter Milan around the corner, timing is everything.

The right-back last played in November after sustaining his injury on international duty and said: 'I don't really have a timescale for when I will be ready but, hopefully, it will be soon.

'It has been really frustrating because it is much better to know exactly whether you will be out for three weeks or whatever.

'I picked up the injury with Sweden but there was another problem and it has taken longer than I expected.

'But I am back in full training now and I am getting closer.

'January and February are two big months and there are some huge games that you want to be playing in. The league is exciting and we are in both cups as well as the Europa League.

'It has been hard just sitting watching. You just want to be out on the pitch but I had four months out last season and again this year. It's not enjoyable.'

Adam Matthews, Darnell Fisher and Efe Ambrose can all play his position and Lustig admitted: 'There is a lot of competition for places. There have been three right-backs here for a while, so I am used to it. It's not a big problem but I know it is going to be tough.'

He will play no part in today's second — and final — Gran Canaria friendly against Sparta.

The patchy, dry pitch of the Maspalomas Stadium has done Celtic's players few favours. Taking no chances, Deila will field his fringe kids.

Mikael Lustig believes Tuesday's game against Sparta Prague will be a good opportunity to impress

'It's a chance for some of the guys who maybe haven't been playing as much to show what they can do,' said Lustig. 'Sparta are a good side, so it will be good experience for our young players.'

The Swede has his eyes on bigger games ahead. As well as Rangers and Inter, Celtic face a Scottish Cup tie at Dundee and must find a way to win their games in hand and leapfrog Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership.

'Aberdeen haven't lost in a long time and they have been looking really good,' added Lustig.

'We have to stay focused on our games because we know if we keep winning, then we will win the title.

'There have always been good teams in the league, so we have always been focused.

'And the challenge means we have to stay that way because Aberdeen have done brilliantly.

'They are up there but we can't play Aberdeen every week. We have to take care of our own games. I think we are making progress in the right direction.'

Lustig admits the experience of going head to head with Aberdeen, after reaching three titles in a row with a minimum of resistance, is a new one.

'It is exciting being involved in a title race,' he said. 'The last couple of seasons, we knew in February we were going to win the title.

'It's a bit different this time round but it does keep you focused. There is no way we can rest four or five players at times like we did towards the end of last season.

'We are not going to win the league by 20 points this year. I think it is going to be quite tight.

'Hopefully, our strength will show in the end. We have experienced players but we still need to treat every game like a cup final.'
