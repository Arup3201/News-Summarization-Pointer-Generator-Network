Speaking after the fight, Shaun White said: 'The fight finished and just as he left the ring, he collapsed.

'It is one of those situations where you just don't know what to say but my heart goes out to all his friends and family and I send my heartfelt condolences to them.'

His trainer Micky Alan wrote on Facebook: 'I just want everybody to know that the past 30 hours taught me a lot. And I got what people call the boxing trainer's worst nightmare.

'I hope people know that Lance's partner, daughter and family will need a lot of help no matter how okay they say they are. I want to thank Lee Jackson who stuck with Lance and me right through.

'Lee was running about like a mad man all night. I'll never forget that.

'R I P top boxer Lance.'

Photographer Kirsty Radliffe, from Southport, covered several of Ferguson-Prayogg's fights.

She said: 'He was a really polite guy, well-mannered, a real gent.

'Everyone respected him and no-one had a bad word to say about him.

'After
 every fight he'd won, he'd stand in the ring and just do a 360 degree 
back flip. I suppose he could be a show-off. Everyone who knew him is 
talking about what's happened.'

She added: 'First aid and medics, who look after a lot of boxers on the shows in Liverpool, have looked after Lance.

'They do the medical checks on all the boxers before the fights and always make sure they are safe.

'They do an amazing job, and they are very well-respected within the boxing community.'

Marcellus
 Baz, from the Nottingham School of Boxing, described the fight that the
 man had taken part in as 'white collar boxing'.

He told the BBC: 'It's not a governed sport... it's got to be governed, it's got to have more safety.'

White-collar
 boxing got its name because it mostly involves men and women from 
white-collar professions. Many have had no previous boxing experience.

Robert Smith, of the British Boxing Board of Control said: 'The British Boxing Board of Control is the recognised authority of professional boxing.

'We do not recognise white-collar boxing. They are not professional. We think people are putting themselves at risk.

'There are a number of safety requirements and we know how much that costs to make sure people can take part in the sport that can be dangerous.

'Just because someone puts on the gloves in the ring doesn't mean they are a professional boxer.

'Obviously this is very sad for the gentleman's family and friends.'
