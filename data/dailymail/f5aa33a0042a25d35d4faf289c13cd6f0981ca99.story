A taxi company in Stockholm is putting therapists in the back of its cars in an effort to help the notoriously reserved Swedes get in touch with their feelings.

It comes after record number of Swedes reported feeling lonely, something which may have to do with them having the highest percentage of one-person households per capita in the EU - 47 per cent.

Taxi Stockholm is hoping to combat this by offering fully qualified therapists en-route – for no extra charge.

Three therapists are being sent out with drivers around the capital and will offer counselling and therapy for people while they make the journey.

The therapists can be booked in advance and all of the taxi drivers have signed confidentiality agreements to protect the privacy of the passengers during their 'sessions'

No trip is too short, according to Mia Fahlen, one of the psychologists involved in the Taxi Stockholm project.

She said: 'We don't know exactly how long each trip will be, so we have to be flexible.'

She believes even a ten-minute trip could be enough to get to the bottom of a customer's problems or point them in a direction that could change their lives for the better.

What is more - the experience will most likely be cheaper than booking an ordinary therapy session, with Ms Fahlen explaining that an hour-long discussion with her usually costs up to 1,200 SEK (£100).

The therapist says she signed up to the scheme to chase the 'thrill of the unknown', but added that she could predict the main topic of worry from residents in the Swedish capital.

She said: 'A lot of people are lonely. There are so many single people in Stockholm.'

'And a lot of the people I meet from abroad tell me they're frustrated with Sweden. They say it's really hard to meet people and that even when they try, the Swedes can be very quiet.'

Natalia Santos, a press officer for Taxi Stockholm, said the idea sprung from a customer survey the company recently carried out, finding that many people seemed to enjoy the chance to talk to someone by speaking to the cab driver.
