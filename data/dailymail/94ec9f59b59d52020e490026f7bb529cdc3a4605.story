A 42-year-old man who posted abusive Twitter messages about the murder of school teacher Ann Maguire has been pictured for the first time.

Robert Riley, of Port Talbot, South Wales, appeared before magistrates in Leeds yesterday where he admitted sending a grossly offensive, abusive or malicious message.

Wearing a tracksuit top over a grey T-shirt and a pair of jogging bottoms, Riley was brought into court after being detained overnight for his own safety due to anger about his shocking messages.

Troll: Robert Riley posted offensive messages about the death of teacher Ann Maguire online

Court: He admitted posting the tweets in before magistrates yesterday and will be sentenced later this week

The messages were not read out in court but the bench heard that some of them related to the murder of Mrs Maguire, 61, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds a week ago.

The magistrates were told that Riley needed to be sentenced where the messages were sent and agreed to transfer the case to Swansea Magistrates' Court.

Riley, of Dan Y Coed, Cwmavon, Port Talbot, was given bail on condition that he does not use social networking sites or the internet generally between now and his next court appearance on Thursday.

During the 10-minute hearing his solicitor Michael Walsh said: 'He is mortified by his own behaviour and he apologises for any upset that may have been caused to everybody.'

Mr Walsh asked the magistrates to free his client on bail, telling them the only reason he had been held overnight was for his own safety.

He suggested that Riley may be in more danger in a Leeds prison than he would be walking the streets.

Tragedy: Teacher Ann Maguire was killed while she taught a class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds last week

Earlier, Sandra White, prosecuting, told the court that Riley had posted a number of offensive tweets, only some of which related to the murder of Mrs Maguire.

She said the offence had come to the attention of West Yorkshire Police because of the latest incident, but told the bench that it should properly have been charged in South Wales.

Riley is the second person to be charged with sending a 'malicious communication' in the wake of the death of Mrs Maguire, who was stabbed to death in her classroom.

Jake Newsome, 21, from the Harehills area of Leeds, was released on bail after being charged over alleged abuse, police have said. He is due to appear before Leeds Magistrates' Court on Wednesday May 14.

Mrs Maguire died after she was attacked during a Spanish lesson at the school where she had taught for more than 40 years. She was due to retire in September.

The
 killing is thought to be the first time a teacher has been stabbed to 
death in a British classroom and the first murder of a teacher in a 
school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre.

Heartbroken: Mrs Maguire's husband of 37 years, Donald, and their two daughters Kerry, 32, and Emma, 30, view the wall of floral tributes placed outside the school

Prayers were said for Mrs Maguire and her family on Sunday.

Deacon Sean Quigley included the family of the 15-year-old boy charged with murdering the 61-year-old in his homily at Corpus Christi Church in Leeds which is attached to the school.

Mr Quigley, a retired teacher at the college who knows the Maguire family, told the congregation: 'The school, staff and pupils have been consoled by messages from around the world and by many gifts of flowers, and also of food and books.

'The family of the young man involved also have been consoled in their great distress by the messages of love they have received.'

A 100m-long wall of floral tributes now runs from the church to the school gates. A book of condolence has also been opened for those who want to express their sympathies.

A 15-year-old boy appeared in court last week charged with mother-of-two Mrs Maguire's murder and was remanded in custody.
