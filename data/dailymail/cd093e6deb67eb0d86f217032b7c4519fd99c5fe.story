West Brom have continued their squad overhaul by signing Porto winger Silvestre Varela on loan.

The Portugal international has joined on a season-long deal to become Albion's 10th new recruit of the transfer window.

Baggies head coach Alan Irvine said: 'Silvestre is a vastly-experienced player, both with Porto and his national team, and I'm delighted we've managed to secure his services.

International pedigree: Varela was part of Paulo Bento's World Cup squad earlier this summer

'He's got pace and power, gets his fair share of goals and is also a creator of chances for others.

'He's a fantastic addition to our squad.'

Varela played for his country at this summer's World Cup in Brazil, coming off the bench to score in their group game against the United States, which ended in a 2-2 draw.

Surplus to requirements: Despite featuring in 130 games for Porto he has been allowed to leave on loan

The 29-year-old right-sided player has won 26 caps in total and netted five international goals.

Varela came through Sporting Lisbon's youth system and had spells on loan from the club at Casa Pia, Vitoria Setubal and Recreativo Huelva.

He made a permanent move from Sporting to Estrela Amadora in the summer of 2008 before sealing a switch the following year to Porto.
