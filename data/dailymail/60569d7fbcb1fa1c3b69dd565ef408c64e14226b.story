A jet skier who saved the life of a little girl when she drifted half-a-mile out to sea on a boogie board says he only did what anyone else would have done.

Tony Barraclough was on the beach at Rozel, Jersey, when he heard Rebecca Chambers, the girl's mother, frantically screaming.

The 52-year-old hopped onto his jet ski and found little Jemima relaxing on her boogie board half-a-mile from the shore.

Saved: Jemima Chambers, four, had no idea she drifted half-a-mile out when she fell asleep on her body board

'I was putting the jet ski back on the trailer when I heard a woman shouting "Where is she?"' he said.

'I
 just told the woman to trust me, and that we would find her. The mother
 jumped on the back of the jet ski with me and we headed out of the 
harbour.

'I just did what anyone would have done.

'I'm no hero.

'When the mother said "I don’t know how to thank you’ I just told her ‘don’t let it happen again."'

The Virgin Atlantic pilot added: 'She was a hell of a long way out.

'She was four years old and couldn’t exactly wave for help.

'She would have been even further out if we hadn’t got to her when we did.

'Thankfully
 the jet ski is so fast we were able to find her and get her out really 
quickly. She was oblivious to what was going on.'

Relief: Her mother Rebecca (pictured) panicked as she looked back at the shore to see Jemima was missing

Desperate search: The family raised the alarm on Rozel Bay, Jersey. A jet skier powered out to sea to find her

Mrs Chambers lost sight of the 
four-year-old when she went swimming in the sea, leaving her daughter in
 the shallow water with her siblings and cousins.

When she returned, the child was a speck on the horizon after drifting off on the board.

When Mr Barraclough and Mrs Chambers reached her, Jemima was oblivious to how far she'd gone.

Jemima and her three siblings spent three nights 
staying with their aunt Rachel Le Marquand and her two children at her 
home in Jersey last week.

The
 families had spent most of Wednesday afternoon playing in the sea at 
Rozel Bay when the women decided to swim around the harbour.

But
 when they returned to where Jemima had been playing with cousins Emily,
 ten, Jamie, six, and siblings Mollie, eight, Caspar, six, and Bruno, 
two, they realised she was missing.

Mrs
 Chambers, from Ashleworth, Gloucestershire, said: ‘I was only gone a 
short while and as I came back I realised Jemima wasn’t with the others 
on the shore line.

‘I asked 
the children where she was and they all pointed at this speck on the 
horizon. It honestly just looked like a buoy which was floating out at 
sea. She had gone well beyond the sea wall and out really far.

‘It
 was amazing. This man just appeared by my side as I was starting to 
panic and before I knew what had happened I was on the back of his jet 
ski, off towards her.

‘My 
heart rate is still coming down from it all. I still can’t believe how 
lucky we were.’ She said Jemima had not realised how much danger she was
 in.

‘She thought she 
hadn’t gone that far, when we got there I saw her eyes widen when she 
realised just how far the shore line was.

‘It
 could have been a lot worse had she realised how far out she was, she 
could have panicked, lost her board and who knows what might have 
happened.

‘She was never in 
any difficulty, I think she was just in a very relaxed state, she had 
her board, a life jacket and a wetsuit on.

‘I
 think the combination of high tides and strong sea winds swept her out 
that far. It apparently happened in a matter of minutes, one minute she 
was there, the next she wasn’t.’

Appeal: The family, from Gloucester, are now appealing to find the jet skier that saved Jemima in Rozel Bay, Jersey, so they can thank him

Mrs Chambers said she now regrets leaving the children alone, albeit for just a few minutes.

‘I
 think I was lulled into a false sense of security because they were 
just paddling in the really shallow water,’ she said. ‘In hindsight, 
because of that I made the poor decision to go for a swim myself and my 
attention was not as focused as it should have been.

‘I
 don’t think Jemima’s realised the full impact of what could have 
happened, she was more excited about the jet ski ride. That was the 
highlight of her holiday. We are so thankful to that man, it could have 
been so much worse if it hadn’t been for him.

‘I
 realised when I got back to the shore and made sure she was OK ... I 
never thanked him properly. I’d love to be able to do that.’

Mrs
 Le Marquand, 43, who lives on Jersey, said: ‘We spotted this dot off 
the headland – we couldn’t even make out it was a body but it was her.

‘She’d floated right around the corner, far too far out to swim.

‘Luckily,
 there was a man on a jet ski nearby. He didn’t shout at us for being 
bad parents – he jumped on his jet ski with my sister and zoomed off.

‘I
 don’t think the kids really realised quite how serious the situation 
was. They were in fits of giggles and thought it was marvellous that 
their mummy was on a jet ski.’

No
 one is sure how far Jemima would have been swept out had she not been 
rescued so quickly, but her shaken mother said ‘the tide and the current
 were definitely against her’.

She added that although there had been a lifeguard on duty, ‘he was a little way from where we were’.

Mrs
 Chambers is a qualified paediatrician who now looks after her children 
full-time. Her husband, Mungo, a cosmetic surgeon, was at work while his
 family were at the seaside.
