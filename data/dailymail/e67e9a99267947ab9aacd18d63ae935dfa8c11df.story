Council workers were forced to use a chainsaw to hack their way into a property after it had been left to become completely overgrown by its owner.

The eyesore in Crewkerne, Somerset, had stood vacant since 2006 before it was seized by South Somerset District Council.

The neglected South Street property was visited by council officials, police officers and a bailiff who required a chainsaw to cut back the thicket and weeds in order to gain access to the front door.

Once inside, officials were greeted with an empty home stripped of its valuables, with graffiti on the fire-charred walls, smashed windows and a burnt out sofa.

After several attempts to contact the owner of the property - who the council say has failed to pay council tax for at least six years - the authority gained a court order to seize ownership.

It is hoped that, once the costs are recovered through sale at an auction, the house will be renovated and made available for a local family to move in.

A district council spokesman said: 'This property had been left to rot and had become an overgrown eyesore not far from the centre of Crewkerne.

'On Friday we took over control of the property after repeated attempts to try and enter into a dialogue with the owner about the future of the property failed.

'A locksmith secured the property and it will also now be guarded by a security company to prevent vandalism.

'Loans and grants can be offered in appropriate circumstances and the council always tries to negotiate a successful outcome with all parties concerned, but at the end of the day if all attempts fail it can resort to enforcement action.'

Councillor Shane Pledger, portfolio holder for empty properties, said: 'We prefer to negotiate with owners of properties to get them back into use, but the case of this property in Crewkerne goes to show what can happen if owners leave properties empty and refuse to do anything about them.

'We will do all we can to ensure that properties in south Somerset are not left empty, let's not forget that a property brought back in to use is one less property we have to build.

'We have to ensure that we have enough housing for our residents and by bringing properties back into use, we can achieve that.'
