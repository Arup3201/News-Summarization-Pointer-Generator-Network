For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. 

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' – serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager reveals his thoughts about the maverick talent of midfielder Ravel Morrison.

I had Ravel Morrison at QPR last season. Sir Alex Ferguson said he was the most naturally gifted player he had seen at Manchester United since Paul Scholes - and then sold him because he could do nothing with him.

He’d been at West Ham, scored one of the goals of the season against Tottenham but they, too, found it hard to control him. He’d already had one loan spell at Birmingham City, but ended up with me.

The kid can really play. He goes past people and makes them look silly. He’s like the strolling England player Alan Hudson in the 1970s. He doesn’t run, he glides.

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!

By the time we came to the end of the season, though, he couldn’t get in our starting line-up.

There was one game last season when we’d lost confidence and were losing. I asked him to change his position, to play on the left. His face fell into a petulant pout.

‘I pulled him away from the rest, took him outside and explained as patiently as the time allowed. ‘Ravel, we are losing the f****** game,’ I said. ‘I just want you to play there and do a job for the team. We have to win the game. It’s not about you, OK? It’s about the team.

‘People look at your face in there when I’ve asked you to do something, and they will all go away and think you are a big-headed bastard, because your attitude stinks. That’s what people say about you.’

Second half he was absolutely different class. He ran the game, everything good we did came from him and we were all watching it thinking, ‘‘What a talent’’. You looked at that performance and thought he could get us promoted on his own if he put his mind to it. It was like watching a player with Gareth Bale’s class in the Championship.

Lee Clark, the Birmingham City manager, said to Ravel that he was the best player since Gazza. His response: ‘Who’s Gazza?’

Should that surprise us? Admittedly that World Cup in Italy is 24 years ago now, and Ravel is 21, but however long ago it was I think he can be expected to know who Paul Gascoigne is. But it does show you that when you’ve gone, when you’ve had your day, nobody cares.

If Morrison had played consistently at his best, he might have gone to the World Cup; on his bad days you wouldn’t have put him in our reserve team.
