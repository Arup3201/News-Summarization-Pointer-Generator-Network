A potential juror in the George Zimmerman trial in Florida was dismissed from court over a Facebook post on a campaign website that said the 'justice system needed an enema'.

The potential juror identified on his Facebook page as Jerry Counelis, gave rambling answers to the attorneys when asked if he would be impartial to the Trayvon Martin shooting case, on the third day of jury selection.

But the unemployed painter, who said he would have no problem being sequestered if chosen to serve, was ordered to leave because of comments he made on a Facebook campaign page.

After the attorneys had finished questioning Mr Counelis, known as panellist E-7, they spoke to circuit judge Debra Nelson.

The judge asked Mr Counelis about a remark posted to the Coffee Party Progressives Facebook page in March, according to the Daily News.

The page had several other remarks about Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, and the police in Sanford, where the teenager was shot.

After the judge handed him a piece of paper with an item circled on it, Mr Counelis admitted he had written the remark and was dismissed.

It is not yet clear if he was struck off the list of potential jurors. So far 75 people from a pool of 200 potential jurors have been dismissed. 

Victim: 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot dead as he walked back to his parents' house in Sanford, Florida

According to ABC News, Mr Counelis was asked by the attorneys whether he had heard much about the case since the teenager was shot in February, and whether he had posted anything about the shooting online.

He replied: 'No. Best to avoid, at times,' and said he had not formed an opinion on the case.

The Coffee Party Progressives Facebook page showed a person matching the potential juror's identity had written an inflammatory comment in response to a posting about the case.

After declaring that justice was coming, the Facebook comment alleged a conspiracy involving Zimmerman and local police.

'With the noise we made…it couldn't be covered up,' the commenter said. 'I only hope the Feds go farther than just this case in investigating This "Police Force"…'

According to ABC the post has since been removed.

Zimmerman, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder and, if found guilty, faces life in prison.

While neither side disputes that Zimmerman shot the 17-year-old as he walked back to his gated community home, prosecutors claim Zimmerman used racial profiling and followed the teenager even after a dispatcher told him not to.

The defense claims Zimmerman’s actions were in self-defense after the teenager started to beat him up.
