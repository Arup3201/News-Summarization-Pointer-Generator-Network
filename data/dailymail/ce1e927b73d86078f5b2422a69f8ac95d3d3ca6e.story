Team USA and their winning haul of medals were on their way home today as athletes, VIPs and coaches gathered at London's airports and train stations to begin the post-Games mass exodus.

About 6,000 athletes will leave from Heathrow through a temporary terminal as big as three Olympic 
swimming pools, reported operator BAA.

Gold medal swimmer Ryan Lochte tweeted a picture from his flight and said: 'It's been fun London but now it's time to get back to the good ole USA --lunch anyone?'

Heading home early: Gold medallist Gabrielle Douglas tweeted a picture from her flight on August 11 as she flew back to the U.S. before the closing ceremony

Gold medalist Gabby Douglas tweeted a picture from the plane on August 11 as she flew back to the U.S. before the closing ceremony in London.

The champion gymnast is set to appear on Jay Leno's chat show this evening alongside First Lady Michelle Obama. 

Olympian gold-medal winning swimmer Missy Franklin will appear on the show on August 15.

Ashton Eaton, who won gold in the decathalon, will appear tonight on David Letterman while he hosts the entire women's gymnastic team tomorrow.

Douglas will join her teammates Jordyn Wieber, McKayla Maroney, Kyla Ross and Aly Raisman on the talk show.

Today will be one of Heathrow 
Airport's busiest ever days as 116,000 people jet away from Britain, 
following the final day of the Olympics.

Athletes, expected to depart with more 
than three bags each, had the opportunity to check in their luggage at 
the Olympic Village this weekend before it was driven to the airport to 
be processed through the baggage system overnight. It is hoped that this will help to relieve the pressure at the airport today. 

On arrival at the terminal, athletes 
were treated to a special London-themed send-off. Athletes were clapped 
into each terminal by a guard of honour made up of volunteers.

The airport was treated to a Games 
makeover so the stars of the show could be given a final reminder of 
London before they leave the host city for good.

The
terminal is the size of three Olympic swimming pools, park benches, and
has been adorned with artificial grass turf, and a memory tree.

Athletes
and officials are encouraged to jot down their favorite Games moments 
and pin them to the branches of the tree before they depart.

Achievement: Some of the athletes, including the U.S. women's water polo team said their best memories of the Games were taking home gold

More and more messages were posted 
throughout the morning as the tree accumulated its paper 'leaves' in the
form of hand-written memories posted by the competitors.

The
walls of the terminal have been decorated with pictures of the 
capital's skyline and images of the routemaster bus and the 
old-fashioned red phonebox.

Kate Reisinger, the manager of the U.S. women’s hockey team, said she had been delighted with her time in London.

Her team came 12th and last in the 
hockey, but Ms Reisinger, flying home to Colorado Springs in Colorado 
today, concentrated on the positive.

She said: 'London has been so 
welcoming and everything has been so well organised. I have seen some of
the tourist attractions in London and even found some nice, quiet 
places to relax in.'

Two more gold medal-winners - 
Courtney Mathewson and Tumua Anae of the USA water polo team - checked 
in for a flight home to California.

Anae, 23, said: 'The Games were 
awesome. The people were so good to us. All the volunteers were so 
friendly and gave us a lot of support.

'I have to say to Britain - you guys did a great job.'

Mathewson, 25, said: 'I loved London. Everything was perfect. I was very impressed.'

No aircraft will depart from the 
Games terminal. Instead, athletes will take an airside coach to their 
departure point in the main airport. Once there, lucky fans will get one last opportunity to mingle with their heroes as they wait for flights together.

Regular passengers should not be affected or see longer waits than usual, according to BAA.

But not everyone is
flying home. The Dutch athletes were pictured queuing and showing off 
their various medals at St Pancras International, as they waited to 
board the Eurostar to make their way back to the Netherlands.

The
French team were also pictured at St Pancras. They looked a little less
upbeat than their Dutch counterparts as a number of them used their 
time queuing for the Eurostar home by having a nap.

Despite the busy period, the athletes
leaving the capital seemed to be enjoying the new terminal at Heathrow, put up 
especially in their honor.

They were also full of praise about the friendliness and hospitality they were privy to throughout their stay in London.

Admiring the elaborate make-up of the
make-shift terminal today, gold medal winner Chris Brown, of the 
Bahamas, said: 'I have been tremendously well looked after here in 
London.'

Brown, 33, who ran the first leg as 
the Bahamas won the men’s 4x400 metres relay, had been competing in his 
fourth Olympics, having picked up silver in Beijing in 2008 and bronze 
at Sydney in 2000.

Proudly showing off his gold medal, he said: 'These Games in London have been great. London has staged a fantastic Olympics.

'Everything has worked out well today and this special terminal is a bit of fun.'

Carmelina Moscato, a member of the 
Canadian team which took bronze in the women’s football, experienced the
hospitality not just of London but also of Coventry, Manchester and 
Newcastle upon Tyne during her Olympics.

Due to fly to Toronto today, Moscato, 28, said: 'We enjoyed playing at all three cities and the hotels were good.

'This has been one of the best 
experiences I could have wished for. It’s like being in dreamland. I 
could not have asked for more.'

Heathrow spent $31million preparing to handle 80 per cent of Olympics visitors, according to the statement.
