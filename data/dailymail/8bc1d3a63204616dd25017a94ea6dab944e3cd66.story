Before the start of the Ashes series last summer, one of England’s back-room staff privately voiced concerns about two members of the Australian set-up.

Darren Lehmann, soon to replace Mickey Arthur as coach, was one. The other was Ryan Harris, the bullocking but injury-prone fast bowler who until this year had never played more than three Tests in a row because his body simply couldn’t stand the strain.

Lehmann has since been credited with helping the Australians to relax, replacing video replays on the team bus of the side’s latest match with music and cans of beer. And Harris, far from breaking down, is now on the verge of a sixth successive Test. 

No worries: Aussie skipper Michael Clarke is thought to be fine despite having trouble with his ankle in Adelaide

24 - Harris's wickets in the summer Ashes series. He was second only to Graeme Swann (26), despite playing one Test fewer.

9/10 - Nine of Harris's top 10 dismissals are English, including Alastair Cook (6) and Joe Root and Ian Bell (both 4).

19.58 - Harris's average in the summer, considerably lower than England's top bowlers: Broad (27.45), Swann (29.03), Anderson (29.59), Bresnan (29.60).

Since the previous five, starting at Lord’s in July, have brought him 29 English wickets at under 19 apiece, the concerns of the back-room staffer have proved worryingly prescient.

And any hopes England might have had of Harris sitting out what could be a gruelling Test for fast bowlers on Adelaide’s drop-in pitch appear to have been dashed by the fast bowler’s insistence that he intends to approach the second Test ‘all guns blazing’.

One school of thought before this series suggested he would be allowed to sit out one of the five Tests in order to ensure he was still charging in at 90mph at the series finale in Sydney in the new year.

But Harris insisted: ‘I am not going to 
miss a Test unless I have to. I have said since the start I am here to 
play five Tests. Boof [Lehmann] has not mentioned one word about me 
resting which is good. I am feeling good and ready to go.’

Most of the focus since Australia’s 381-run win at Brisbane has been on Mitchell Johnson, who claimed nine wickets in the match with his pace and hostility. But Harris took five himself, and is in the process of establishing strangleholds over all of England’s major batsmen.

In his five Tests this year, he has dismissed Alastair Cook and Joe Root four times each, as well as Kevin Pietersen three times and Ian Bell twice. And the absence of another regular victim, Jonathan Trott (four dismissals), has created a vacancy at No 3 which the Australians are hoping will turn into a weakness.

‘It is a great loss with Trotty not there,’ said Harris. ‘It is going to be interesting to see who they put in there. Hopefully it will be Bell in there early, as it will give us a chance to get him out. Whoever it is, Belly or Joe Root, they are both good players.’

At Brisbane, where Johnson was the bowler who most troubled Trott, it was easily forgotten that Harris had exposed his discomfort against the short ball during the summer. But he had only generous words for his opponent, who flew home last week because of a stress-related illness.

‘Jonathan has gone now,’ he said. ‘I will be disappointed if anyone brings that up on the field. It is not a nice thing he is going through. All the boys who have commented on it have said we want Jonathan Trott back playing cricket. The whole world does.

‘I know the Australian team does, because he is one of their best players and we want to play against their best team. He has made a big decision to go home and I would love to see him back playing soon. The England team needs him, but world cricket needs him too because he is a world-class player.’

Trott’s departure, however, has not dimmed the hosts’ competitive spirit. A frailty has been noted among the England batsmen, and – drop-in pitch or not – Australia’s fast bowlers intend to exploit it.

Harris said: ‘Mitch has already said he is not going to change the way he bowls. No matter what kind of wicket you are on, if you are bowling that quick the bouncers are either going to go over your head – or hit you if they don’t bounce.’

Meanwhile, Michael Clarke was said to be ‘OK’ by Cricket Australia after appearing to roll his right ankle during Monday’s training session at the Adelaide Oval.

The Australian captain, who made a century at the Gabba, came through nets practice after repeatedly flexing his right ankle during fielding drills, and is not thought to be in danger of missing the second Test.

Movember may be over, but Mitchell Johnson is expected to keep his terrifying tache for the rest of the Ashes.

The paceman, who sported a Dennis Lillee-style growth while taking nine wickets at the Gabba, tweeted: ‘Should I keep the Mo?? Well if we can raise $50,000 by Dec 3, I will keep it for the rest of the ashes series! Donate to my mo space.’

Meanwhile, former Aussie paceman Jason Gillespie believes England flattered Johnson in Brisbane. He tweeted: ‘Of the 229 balls Johnson bowled at the Gabba, only 10 would have hit the stumps. England will have seen that.’
