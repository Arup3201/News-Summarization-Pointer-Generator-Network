A woman who wet herself on a scary ride was horrified to discover a photo of her unfortunate accident is being used to promote the Amusement Park.

The woman lost control of her bladder on a ‘terrifying’ horror maze, ‘CornEvil’ which is strictly restricted to people 16 years and over at Spookers Haunted Attraction Scream Park in New Zealand

A photo of a woman leaving the attraction with an embarrassing wet patch has been used on the amusement park’s Facebook page, accompanied with the slogan ‘P*** your pants scary!’

The post has attracted more than 1000 likes and the woman involved says she has been completely humiliated, even though her face is not shown in the photo.

Spookers Haunted Attraction Scream Park made this image their 'cover photo' on Facebook. Even though the woman's face is not included in the image, she claims to have been humiliated when friends and family identified her by her clothing

The woman wet herself in 'CornEvil', a newly updated horror maze in Auckland, which is so terrifying that it is restricted to people 16 years and over

The woman, who did not wish to reveal her identity, complained to the media about her embarrassing moment being showcased so publically, explaining that family and friends have mocked her after recognising her by her clothing.

She demanded that the photo be taken by Spookers, according to the New Zealand Herald.

The newly updated maze is only open after dark and uses actors who chase the ‘victims’ with chainsaws – making it seem slightly understandable how the woman could have lost control of her bladder.

In fact, Spookers management claims on average five people wet themselves every evening.

However, a friend who was there on the night insists that the woman involved wet herself as she couldn’t stop laughing, not out of terror.

The woman contacted New Zealand media about the incident. This left the Spookers staff perplexed, wondering why the woman still hadn't at any point made her concerns known to the company

Yet when reached for comment, the Scream Park explained that they were puzzled why they had not been approached by the woman making the complaints.

Furthermore, at the time of the interview they had been unable to locate her.

Spookers managing director Julie Watson was perplexed as to why the woman involved spoke to the media and never contacted the amusement park directly.

'We've heard nothing from the woman, nothing from her friends, nothing from her family.

'We've had that photo up on our page for about a week and half now.’

Ms Watson insists that, if contacted, they would have happily taken the photo down.

'(If she had contacted us) we'd take it down straight away, that's not a problem at all.

‘If she had been so upset about it, then why haven't they contacted us?’

Spookers explain that in the maze, the actors 'come out crawling, moaning, groaning, screaming or exploding with chainsaws running'

She also pointed out that visitors have ample warning that photos will be taken and the company reserve the right to publish the images as they wish.

"We do have a sign saying we take photos for promotional reasons but if people call us we remove the photos from Facebook immediately."

She explained to Daily Mail Australia that Spookers had not been able to locate the woman.

'You can't tell who it is and we don't even know because she hasn't contacted us.

‘The photo doesn’t appear in full (revealing the woman’s identity) anywhere on the Internet.’

The managing director insists that people wet themselves so frequently at the ‘scream park’ that they have often used the slogan ‘p*** your pants scary’ in promotional campaigns and on bumper stickers.

She also recalled that most people are amused when they wet themselves, with a tendance to ‘walk out and make a scene about it’.

There were mixed reactions from the public online, as Social Media users took to Facebook to share their opinion.

Some people were outraged that Spookers had chosen to make the image public.

‘I think its very bad taste and i wouldnt come to spookers in the future. You obviously get a kick out of peoples embarrasment and humiliation (sic),’ wrote one person.

‘Spookers - we are your future customers, think twice how you treat your customers.’

However the majority of people took a lighter view of the situation, with many people taking the opportunity to play around with puns.

‘Its all just a bit of fun, nothing wrong with taking the p*** every once in a while,’ someone wrote.

The debacle came to a conclusion when the woman finally made contact with Spookers Scream Park, resulting in an apology and the decision that the infamous image could stay.

‘Spookers has just been contacted by the lovely person in the cover photograph,’ the company confirmed on Facebook.

‘We have talked through the way the photo has been handled, and together we have come to an arrangement that includes an agreement that the photo can continued to be used.

‘We really appreciate her generous gesture to Spookers in allowing this, and have apologised for the embarrassment that she has felt.’ 

The 'Scream Park' is open in two locations in New Zealand and is now looking for a site in Australia.
