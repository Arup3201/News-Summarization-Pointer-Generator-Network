Steve Ockerby resigned as chair of governors after taking his children on a holiday during term-time

A chair of governors at a primary school has been forced to quit after taking his children out of lessons for a three-day trip to Lapland despite being refused permission.

Steve Ockerby resigned from his role at Shibden Head Primary Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, after furious parents noticed photographs of the trip were posted on Facebook.

The family, who have a daughter at the school and a son at nearby Queensbury School, made the decision to take their children on the trip, despite the threat of a £360 fine.

Mr Ockerby, who is a firefighter with West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue service, was warned his daughter's absence would be treated as 'unauthorised'.

His decision comes as Bradford Council continues its crackdown on school absence during term time.

Councillor Ralph Berry, the executive member for children's services at the council, called Mr Ockerby's actions 'breathtaking' and pointed out that school attendance rules applied to all parents.

The firefighter has now stepped down from his position as governor but said he remained 'totally committed' to the school.

He said: 'My role in the Fire Service dictates I have to work shifts and have an allocated holiday pattern which leaves me with no choice over when I can take holiday.

'We followed the correct procedure, according to the school policy, to request leave of absence during school time, and we received notification back from the school that the trip would be unauthorised.

'This is the first time we've taken our child out of school. My daughter has a 100 per cent attendance record and is achieving well.

'However, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the whole of my family.

'I understand that people will condemn me for my decision. They are, of course, entitled to their opinion.

'It is unfortunate that my family's enjoyment has caused some parents so much distress.

'I am fully aware that my actions may result in a fine. I will pay whatever sanction is imposed.

Mr Ockerby said his job as a firefighter left him with no other choice and he has since stepped down from his position at Shibden Head Primary School (pictured)

'I remain totally committed to supporting the school. However, as people are very quick to condemn my actions and after nearly five years of dedication, commitment and time, I feel it is in my best interest to resign from the governing body as my family will always come first.'

Earlier this year, Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, was branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a holiday to the Caribbean for after the Christmas holidays.

Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off but caved under pressure and cancelled the trip.

In June, a head teacher was allowed to take unpaid leave from Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons'.

But his absence caused outrage after parents found out he had travelled to South America for the World Cup in Brazil.

Mr McGovern's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another Leicester school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married.

The decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union.

Vina Pankhania, 30, head teacher at Little Hill primary school, was allowed to take almost a month off work between the beginning of the Easter term and start of the summer holidays this year after governors said she had 'worked extremely hard'.

Meanwhile an inquiry has been launched in Bilborough, Nottingham, after Carol Barker, of Woodlands Special School took holiday in term-time.

Councillor Berry said: 'For a governor of a primary academy to take his children out of school during term time while we have a major drive on school attendance is somewhat breathtaking.

'He has done the right thing in resigning. School attendance is a major priority in this city. It is part of raising standards of achievement. Every day lost in education is learning lost.

'The rules apply to everybody.'

Cllr Michael Walls, a former governor at the school, said: 'It was not a wise thing to do under the circumstances, in view of the problem with children being off and keeping kids off school outside school holiday time.

'Being chairman of governors, really he should be backing up the school and the school's policy.'

The school's head teacher, Sarah Thornton, and Helen Rowland, of Focus-Trust, the charitable trust which helps run the school, released a joint statement describing his resignation as a 'huge loss'.

It said: 'In this role, Mr Ockerby has given a significant amount of his own personal time and made a substantial contribution to the strong leadership of the academy.

'This will be a huge loss to the governing body and school.

'We are all saddened that this matter has overshadowed what has otherwise been a shining example of governance and role model to other parents.'
