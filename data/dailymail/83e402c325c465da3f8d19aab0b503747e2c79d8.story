She has not performed for five years and after an absence from Britain's concert circuit for 12 an appearance by world leading violinist Kyung Wha Chung was hotly anticipated.

But her eagerly awaited return appeared to be overshadowed after the Korean violinist, once a childhood star, lambasted the parents of a child who had coughed through part of her performance.

After reaching the first break in her initial piece the violinist appeared to have become exasperated with a child among the many families at the Royal Festival Hall coughing, and told them 'maybe bring her back when she's older,' according to several members of the audience.

Korean violinist Kyung Wha Chung appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Tuesday - her first performance in the UK in 12 years - and told parents of a coughing child to bring her back when she's older.

Representatives for the soloist said the audience had an 'unusually' high amount of families and the coughing had being going on for almost a minute after she briefly paused following the first of three movements as she performed Mozart's G Major Sonata.

Her reaction was met with mixed responses.

Violinist Thomas Gould said it was 'difficult to be charmed' by the violinist after she upbraided the parents in what he described as a 'curious outburst.'

He wrote on Twitter: 'The raised temperatures added an extra belligerence to her taut Prokofiev.' 

Others feared the child may be discouraged from going to former concert performances following the very public put-down and branded Wha Chung as 'arrogant' and 'childish'. 

However some praised the violinist for speaking up about the difficulties performing to a noisy audience.

Ciaobimba posted on Twitter: 'Another evening where London showed its bad Audience Etiquette. Respect @kyungwhachung for taking a stand. Phenomenal concert and encores.' 

Adam Kirklady wrote: 'Brava Madame for taking noisy audience to task between movements of Mozart! Classy #respect #thanks' 

Wha Chung, 66, had not performed for five years after she suffered a finger injury and her appearance at the Royal Festival Hall was widely anticipated by fans of her music who flocked to see her play Mozart 

The talented violinist was a young star, getting her big breakthrough in 1970 and playing the violin from six 

Ms Wha Chung performed at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday evening - returning to the very stage that signalled her breakthrough in 1970.

Details of her appearance led to such excitement that posters advertised her performance with the slogan 'the legend returns.' 

The talented musician, who was not available for comment today as she was on her way back to Korea, had not appeared on the concert circuit for five years after she suffered a finger injury.

She became recognised as a child prodigy, reportedly already playing violin with orchestras in Korea from the age of nine.

A representative for the violinist said she had been pleased to  see so many children and 'spent more than an hour greeting them and signing autographs' after the performance. She said the violinist had spent more than 10 years supporting children's music projects. 

The Southbank Centre, which runs the Royal Festival Hall, said it had not received any complaints after the performance. 

A spokeswoman said: 'At this time of the year in particular, coughing isn't uncommon at events at any venue. Southbank Centre welcomes people of all ages including families and children and we offer a range of events, including classical music, specially designed with children in mind. 

'We don't discourage parents or carers who wish to bring young people to an evening event and we do where possible check that they are aware of the nature of the event. 

'We are aware that Kyung Wha Chung is also a keen supporter of young people experiencing classical music.'
