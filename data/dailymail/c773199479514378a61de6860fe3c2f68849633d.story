They may look like scenes from a sci-fi fantasy film, but rather than being created by a Hollywood special effects unit, theses photographs are the work of two mountaineers and a photographer.

Daniel Arnold and Stephan Siegrist are professional alpine explorers with years of experience in tackling some of the world's most intense ascents.

They teamed up with climbing photographer Thomas Senf and Swiss mountain sports manufacturer Mammut to create this set of unique images inside frozen waterfalls of Norway.

Ice blue: Daniel Arnold and Stephan Siegrist worked in the glacial surroundings of the Eidfjord in Norway

The pictures were taken in on the Eidfjord in northern Norway, using coloured flares, spotlights and headlamps.

The
terrain, three hours east of the city of Bergen, is famous for the 
large number of icefalls - frozen waterfalls which can reach heights of 
over 500 metres.

The trio 
planned the pictures and then set about lighting the scene by carefully 
positioning coloured spotlights and flares at strategic points in the ice.

The
climbers, who swung from wall to wall to set-up elaborate rope 
structures for the rig, used over 700 metres of electric cable to 
achieve the required set up.

With the mountaineers in place, Senf triggered the lights, casting these dazzling displays of colour onto the walls of the icefalls and captures the scene with his lens.

With
the majority of the work done at night and in sub-zero temperatures, 
the photographer said planning had to be exact for the operation to be a
success.

He said: 'Photography and filming at night is a big challenge, the right lighting determines whether you succeed or fail." 

Such meticulous planning required help of the highest standards in climbers, Arnold and Siegrist.

The pair were the first team to ever complete a winter ascent of Torre Egger, an imposing structure in the ice-fields of Patagonia, South America.

Arnold was born Central Switzerland and grew up in Biel a
tiny mountain village which is accessable only by cable car during 
winter time.

Stephan Siegrist also grew up in Switzerland in the Bernese Alps.
