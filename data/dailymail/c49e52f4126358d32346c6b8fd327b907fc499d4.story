A baseball fan who fell asleep during a televised New York Yankees game is suing network channel ESPN and two of its' broadcasters for $10million after airing his nap live.

26-year-old Andrew Rector claims he has suffered emotional distress since he was captured on live television due to an 'unending verbal crusade' made against him by ESPN announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk.

According to The Smoking Gun, the incident relates to when the camera panned to his 
second-row seat in the lower level of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and 
showed him snoozing.

Major League Baseball has been named as a
 defendant in the complaint after the clip was uploaded to the MLB 
website as part of a highlights packed, allegedly causing a flurry of 
insulting comments.

ESPN announcer Shulman is accused of referring to the New Yorker as 'oblivious', while the second commentator, Kruk, is accused of saying a ballpark is 'not the place you come to sleep'.

Shulman also questioned whether Rector had slept through a third inning home run by Yankee Carlos Beltran, which caused a huge applause from the crowd of 45,000.

Rector,Â works for a car rental company in the Bronx, contends his distress comes from 
being made out to be a 'fatty cow that needs to seats' and a 'confused 
disgusted and socially bankrupt individual'.

The incident occurred during a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 13.

The lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx on July 3.

It also claims that the announcers used words like 'stupor', 'fatty', 'unintelligent', and 'stupid'.

Neither the announcers or ESPN have commented on the complaint.
