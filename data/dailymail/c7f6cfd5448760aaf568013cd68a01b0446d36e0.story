An elderly man failed to get into gear as he reversed his blue Renault into a river after trying to leave a car park.

The pensioner was described as 'shaken up' and was taken to hospital for a routine check-up after the accident.

Police were called to the scene at Old Castle Road at 4.27pm yesterday, where a car was in the Lliedi river, South Wales.

Accident: The man reversed his blue Renault car into the river Lliedi in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire

Ray Sinclair arrived at the scene following the incident, while driving towards Llanelli Leisure Centre,  and took these photographs.

He said: 'I didn't see what happened, but I was told the man was parked across the way and was reversing out of a parking space.

'He went across the car park and reversed straight into the river. He was an elderly man, so we don't know if he was taken ill.'
