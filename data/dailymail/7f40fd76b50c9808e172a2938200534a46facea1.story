This is the moment a couple who took their young children along in their getaway car as they robbed a bank were arrested by police in Utah.

Police in the city of Tooele say Michelle Parker and William Parker, both 27, were arrested shortly after holding up a Wells Fargo branch with their 5-year-old and 2-year-old children in the backseat of their car.

The husband and wife told police they robbed the bank on Monday because they faced eviction and growing medical bills, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

The Parkers were each charged with 
robbery, a second-degree felony; theft, a class A misdemeanor; and two 
counts of reckless endangerment, a class A misdemeanor.

An off-duty officer was seated across 
the street from the bank when he reported seeing what he thought was a 
suspicious vehicle pull up outside the bank.

He watched as a woman ran out and hurried into the bank.

Employees later told police the woman showed the teller a note demanding money.

'No
silent alarms, Be Quiet! Loose Bills,' the note stated according to the
Tribune. 'Hurry. Sorry... I don’t want anyone to get hurt.'

The teller reported relinquishing $956 in cash to her.

When
the woman ran from the bank back to the waiting car, driven by the man,
the off duty officer decided to follow it and eventually pull it over.

Before speaking with the couple inside the car a report of the bank robbery came across his radio prompting him to immediately call for backup.

Police say they searched the vehicle and found the demand note, along with hundreds of dollars in cash.

'The officer... did a great job, and Wells Fargo also did a good job,' Tooele Police Sgt. Todd Hewitt told the Deseret News. 'The teller, the employees in the bank had a ton of information for us when we got there. They followed all their protocols.'

Police say no weapons were found in the couple's possession.

The two children were taken into state custody with their grandfather said to be working on their release.
