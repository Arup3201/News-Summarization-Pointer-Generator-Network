Fun-loving and mischievous: Tyler Whelan was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door, rupturing his abdomen

A mother whose violent partner murdered her son was jailed for four years for allowing his death.

Little Tyler Whelan was kicked so hard by his stepfather that he flew two feet through the air, hitting a door, while his mother Stephanie Whelan was taking two other children to school.

The five year-old’s abdomen was ruptured in the attack in his home in Paston, near Peterborough, and the injury slowly killed him.

Elvis Lee, 34, has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering Tyler.

At Reading Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Nicol sentenced Tyler’s mother to four years in jail.

During an earlier trial at Cambridge Crown Court the 27-year-old was found guilty of allowing the boy’s death.

Mr Justice Nicol said: 'On the morning of March 7, 2011, you left Tyler alone with Elvis Lee while you took your daughter and another young girl to school.

'During the 40 minutes that you were out of the house, Elvis Lee kicked Tyler in the abdomen and kicked him so hard that he flew two feet in the air.

'The kick ruptured Tyler’s small bowel and this substantially contributed to his death about two hours later. The jury found that Elvis Lee had murdered Tyler.'

He added: 'You knew that Elvis Lee was a violent man. You knew that for some 14 months he had been undergoing an anger management course.

'You knew that this had not resulted in him mending his ways. You knew that because only six weeks before the death of Tyler, Elvis Lee had assaulted you.'

During the trial the jury heard Whelan and Lee say they found Tyler face down on the floor after falling from the breakfast bar.

Lee launched the fateful attack on his 
stepson after being left with the boy on March 7 last year while his 
mother took her daughter and his daughter to school and arranged a 
doctor’s appointment.

In June 2010, a year before he died, Tyler was taken to hospital with a fractured leg.

His
mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars 
referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body.

Children's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident.

In
September that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike. 
Again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed
it to be from a genuine accident.

On
February 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a 
radiator burn. Tyler's mother said he was accident prone. He was taken 
to see a GP but there was no further action.

Head
of children's services at Peterborough City Council, councillor Sheila 
Scott said: 'It was a single violent assault that led to his death and 
the perpetrator has now been brought to justice.

Malcolm
Newsam, Executive Director of Children's Services, said: 'There were 
certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more 
rigorous.'

A serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that Tyler's death was predictable or preventable.

Mr
Newsam added: 'Nonetheless the service we offered Tyler was not good 
enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for 
that failing.'

The neglectful mum was gone for just half an hour but by the time she returned the violent child murderer had kicked Tyler hard enough to cause fatal injuries.

Lee then sat the wounded child in front of a bowl of cereal to make the scene look normal when his partner returned, the court heard.

However, once Whelan, who worked as a cleaner during her trial, came home she realised something was wrong and they took the boy to hospital by car.

The court heard how she made a panicked 999 call on the way in which her distress was 'palpable', but it was too late to save little Tyler who died tragically inside the vehicle.

Six weeks earlier Lee had kicked her in the face as she lay on the ground leaving her with a swollen eye and needing hospital treatment.

The trial heard evidence that Tyler suffered a shopping list of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death.

A report published after the conviction of Lee found that key opportunities to protect Tyler were missed by authorities tasked with his care.

It acknowledged previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been 'seen in isolation' with 'minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries'.

Michael Burrows, defending Whelan, said: 'This is obviously a hugely tragic case.

'A young boy was murdered and his mother, who the prosecution accepted liked him, and who the jury found had otherwise cared for Tyler properly, has been held partly responsible for his death.

'For that she has to be sentenced.

'It was on one occasion she left home with a man who had previously been violent to her some six weeks before but who have not been violent to Tyler.'

He added: 'She left Tyler with him for just half an hour or so, not for selfish reasons, not for her own benefit in any way, but rather to take her daughter and in fact his daughter to school and to make an appointment for Tyler to be seen by a doctor later that morning.'
