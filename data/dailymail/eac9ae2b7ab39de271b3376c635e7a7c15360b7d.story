A Connecticut man well known for his massive six million-light Christmas display at his 86-acre estate was found dead inside his other home in Windsor on Friday morning, just weeks after his wife passed away from cancer.

Wealthy investor John Chakalos, 87, was killed by gunshot wounds to the head and chest, according the Windsor police department.

Police are investigating the death as a homicide, noting the condition of the body, when it was found, said police Capt. Tom Lepore, who added that they did not recover a weapon at the scene.

John Chakalos, 87, was found dead on Friday morning from a gunshot wound to the head, while his wife Rita died just before Thanksgiving

The Christmas exhibition typically takes up half of the couple's 86-acre property in Chesterfield, Connecticut, and includes six million lights

Police said one of John Chakalos' 
four daughters stopped at his home on Overlook Drive to check on her 
father when she found him dead at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

'[I] can't speak about leads or 
motives, but we're looking at a number of different angles,' said 
Windsor police Capt. Tom LePore. 'We're speaking with family members to 
develop lists of anyone who may have had a motive or reason to harm 
him.'

Windsor police were first to arrive, and the department called in the Connecticut State Police major crimes squad to assist.

Detectives are working to piece together events in the weeks leading up to Chakalos' death, Lepore said. 

According to state records, Chakalos ran an investment company out of his home.

For the past five years, the family has invited the public to drive through the estate and requested visitors donate money or nonperishable food for local charity Joan's Food Pantry

Police said Chakalos and his late wife, Rita, were philanthropists and split their time between Connecticut and New Hampshire.

Chakalos
 and his wife Rita, who died of cancer a week before Thanksgiving, were 
known in New Hampshire and the surrounding area for their elaborate 
Christmas display at their 86-acre property in Chesterfield that is known as The Farm.

The Christmas exhibition typically takes up half of the property and includes six million lights.

The display, which has lit up Chesterfield off and on for the past 10 years, is usually completed and ready by Thanksgiving with work typically starting in August.

For the past five years, the family has invited the public to drive through the estate and requested visitors donate money or nonperishable food for local charity Joan's Food Pantry.

The extravagant display includes a lifesize Victorian-style village, complete with houses, a hotel and a general store; a 22-foot Santa to greet visitors when they enter the property; and a Nativity scene, among numerous other decorations, reports CNN.

The lights were lit for guests from 6 to 9 p.m. starting Friday, Dec. 13, and ending Sunday, Dec. 22. Washburn said, however, buses from nursing homes were set to be allowed in Monday night and she was expecting some members of the public as well.

The Christmas display will remain open this year, but it isnâ€™t known if the Chakalos family will now continue with the tradition in the future.
