John Guidetti scored twice to break his Scottish Premiership duck and guide Celtic to an away win against a stubborn St Mirren side.

The on-loan Manchester City striker opened his Hoops account in the mid-week League Cup victory over Hearts and was on-hand to help them to another win at St Mirren Park with strikes in either half securing all three points.

Kenny McLean equalised for the hosts after Guidetti opened the scoring with a bundled effort finishing off a goalmouth scramble - and Celtic regained a lead that they would not give up again as the Swede struck at the near post just after the hour mark.

Celtic host Dinamo Zagreb in the Europa League on Thursday night - with Guidetti ineligible - but he made sure he made a lasting impression on the travelling fans, even if his first goal was fortuitous.

Scott Brown slid a low cross into the box and although Marian Kello got to his initial effort the ball ended up in the net after hitting Guidetti and his marker Jim Goodwin.

But the lead didn't last long into the second half and McLean was on hand to convert after Craig Gordon could only parry Jason Naismith's shot.

The afternoon was Guidetti's though - and he secured all three points for Celtic, latching on to Anthony Stokes' clever pass to knock home the winner.
