At least 61 people were crushed to death in a stampede at a New Year's Eve 
fireworks display in 
Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan, authorities said today.

The incident happened outside the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium at about 2am in the Plateau district of the city.

The dead included 26 children, 28 women and six men, according to Minister of Youth Alain Lobognon after visiting the hospital morgue.

Initial reports said a further 200 
people had been injured, but Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko later said
the figure was closer to 40.

The official AIP news agency earlier 
said the victims were all children, ranging from eight to 15 years old.

'They were mostly from Abidjan, the country's largest city and former 
capital, it said, according to CNN.

One of the injured, speaking at a

President Alassane Ouattara, visiting
injured people at the hospital, called the incident a national tragedy 
and said an investigation was underway to determine what happened.

A Reuters correspondent said blood stains and abandoned shoes littered the scene outside the stadium on Tuesday morning.

'My two children came here yesterday.
I told them not to come but they didn't listen. They came when I was 
sleeping. What will I do?' said Assetou Toure, a cleaner.

She did not know if her children had escaped unhurt.

The incident was the worst of its 
kind in Abidjan since 2010, when a stampede at a stadium during a 
football match killed 18 people.

Ivory Coast, once a stable economic 
hub for West Africa, is struggling to recover from a 2011 civil war in 
which more than 3,000 people were killed.
