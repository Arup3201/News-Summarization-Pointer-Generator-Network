A mother-of-three from Chicago has been charged with child endangerment after her 22-month-old daughter died from a methadone overdose.

According to police, Jasmine Robinson, 23, left the baby girl and her two other children, aged four and five, with her husband who suffers from brain and spine cancers and cannot leave his bed.

Robinson left the house in the 6900 block of South Jeffery Boulevard at 9pm on February 14, and when she returned home at 11.30am the next day, she found the lifeless girl on the sofa.

The girl was found lying on top of an empty bottle of methadone, a strong painkiller which Robinson's husband uses.

Assistant State’s Attorney Colleen Rogers did not reveal why Robinson had spent 14 hours away from home overnight.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Robinson was arrested at her home after the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office ruled the child had died of an overdose.

Robinson left the 22-month-old girl, and two other children aged four and five, at home on the 6900 block of South Jeffery Boulevard, Chicago, for 14 hours while she went out

Her other children have now been taken into the care of child services.

At the bond hearing Monday, Judge Donald Panarese Jr. ordered Robinson to be held on a $75,000 (£44,500) bail.
