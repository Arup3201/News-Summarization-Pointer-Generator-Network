A car enthusiast spent $100,000 on a custom-made vehicle which can zip over desert sand dunes and handle practically any type of terrain.

Russell White, 41, from Texas, built the souped-up car, nicknamed the 'Rally Fighter' and boasts that it can  reach speeds of up to 135 miles per hour.

But he readily admits that he tends to drive it around town and can only go a paltry 35mph to keep up with the pace of local traffic.   

Speed: The Rally Fighter is pictured here leaving a trail of dust in the Mojave Desert, Las Vegas, Nevada

Cost: Russell White spent over $100,000 to create the car that can leap over sand dunes in the desert

Owner: White, right, and his son Tim White, left, beam with pride as they are pictured with the Rally Fighter

The Rally Fighter was manufactured by a car specialist called Local Motors but was built by White who put it together with his bare hands.

He said: 'The car was built to drive very fast, that's where it's happy, that's where it wants to be - you just have to be willing to be there with it.

'It can be very dangerous at times, but for me that's the exciting part.

'I like going down the roads where I don't know what's around the corner or on the other side of the hill - it just heightens the sensation of not knowing.'

White, from Texas, built the car in a factory in Chandler, Arizona.

He said: 'Most of the parts are collected together and prepared by Local Motors - I went to the factory and got in there with my hands.

'We started with the bare frame, and built the car to completion and drove it home 30 days later.

Interior: The inside of the souped-up car is seen here, it can reach speeds up to 135 miles per hour

Custom-built: White from Texas, USA, built his street-legal car himself in a factory  in Chandler, Arizona

Terrain: The ultimate custom-made car can zip over desert sand dunes and handle practically any terrain

Attention: White admits that he gets an 'insane amount of attention' when driving the car 

'The engine is from a Corvette and the Camaro SS - it's got a 430 horsepower GM crank motor and 20 inches of travel suspension that allows for driving really fast in the desert.

'It has 420 foot pounds of torque, and passes all state emissions, comes with everything you need to install, run and get it on the road.

'The steering wheel is a Momo wheel, and the column is out of an F150.'

The car is completely street legal, and turns heads wherever Russell drives it.

Powerful: The engine is from a Corvette and the Camaro SS has a 430 horsepower GM crank motor and 20 inches of travel suspension that allows for driving really fast in the desert

Road worthy: It has 420 foot pounds of torque, and passes all state emissions necessary get it on the road

Spin: White said that most of the time he's only driving the car at 35 miles an hour when he is in town

He added: 'I get an insane amount of attention when I'm out driving, sometimes it's a little overwhelming - I'm still getting it after a year and a half driving it.

'Most people want to know what kind of car it is - they come up and start asking questions about it.'

White drives his car in town, but his favorite place to give it a spin is in the middle of the desert.

He said: 'It's a very capable car and you can only go as fast as the person in front of you, most of the time its 35 miles an hour.

'That's why I like coming out in the desert and if I see a dirt road coming along the road, you're going to see my car on the dirt road than you are on the street.'
