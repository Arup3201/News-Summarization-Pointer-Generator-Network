The teenage sons of a former French president and his successor’s mistress have been at war with each other on Twitter – exchanging insults over everything from their parents to the World Cup.

Louis Sarkozy, the 16-year-old son of former President Nicolas, even challenged Leonard Triérweiler, the 15-year-old son of ex-First Lady Valérie, to a fight after the name-calling escalated.  

The spat has left much of France transfixed, with several Twitter users and media commentators calling for the boys’ parents to intervene.

The teenagers started exchanging insulting tweets earlier this month and continued this week after it was revealed Valérie Triérweiler - the former live-in girlfriend of French president Francois Hollande - cost taxpayers at least half-a-million pounds last year.

The money was spent mostly on security, with Ms Triérweiler at the time using four bodyguards, five personal aides, and regularly using state planes and official homes.

After Sarkozy posted a picture on his Twitter page to a news article of the report, the ex-first Lady's son responded with: ‘But this is not my mother who had a credit card of the Elysee for his personal expenses...'

To which Sarkozy retaliated: ‘Mine either.’

The spat continued when Sarkozy junior appeared to support the idea of settling the fall-out with a fight - after it was suggested by another Twitter user who had apparently been following the quarrel.

The teenager, who attends a military school in the US, said: ‘Whenever you want! We soldiers learn how to fight.’

Several French media commentators have shared their opinion on the matter, and today the website of news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur appeared to criticise the social media spat.

‘Neither Louis Sarkozy nor Leonard Triérweiler have any right to get involved in such complex political questions’, it said.
