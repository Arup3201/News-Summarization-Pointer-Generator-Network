Embattled Rangers boss Ally McCoist insists he will only walk away from Ibrox if the mounting professional crisis tips over into his family life.

It is widely understood that only an inability to fund the seven-figure pay-off guaranteed in his contract has stayed the hands of at least some Rangers powerbrokers eager to dispense with the manager’s service.

Yet McCoist publicly declared yesterday that he had ‘absolutely no reason’ to doubt the board’s support for him – while also claiming that he retained the confidence of supporters.

He also said that personal abuse directed at him in the aftermath of Wednesday night’s catastrophic late collapse against the part-timers of Alloa was easily brushed aside.

However, asked how he would react if the pressure of the situation began to affect his family, McCoist said: ‘Completely different. That’s completely different, there’s nothing more important than my family.’

Pressed on whether he would have a decision to make if his children, in particular, were to be affected, he conceded: ‘One hundred per cent. But there is no sign of that, no.

‘I think the older ones - I can’t speak for them, I can only speak to them - are sensible enough to see the bigger picture and I’m hoping the younger ones are too young to see it.

‘I’m very, very hopeful that I don’t take it (the pressure) home. I’m saying that, you would have to ask people at my home, but I don’t think I take it home. And I think it is very, very important that I don’t take it home.’

Part-time Alloa came from two goals down to beat Rangers 3-2 in the semi-final of the Petrofac Training Cup

McCoist admitted that he hadn’t spoken to anyone on the Rangers board - including the Easdale brothers believed to be pushing for his dismissal - since the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final upset in Clackmannanshire.

Yet he insisted: ‘I’ve got absolutely no reason to doubt that I have their support. And until I hear otherwise then I couldn’t comment on it. I’ve got absolutely no doubt at this moment of time that I have their support because I haven’t heard otherwise.

‘I imagine that question has been asked following some of the comments in some of the newspapers this morning.

‘I haven’t read them all but nobody has told me otherwise that I don’t have the support of the board. I don’t feel the need to seek reassurance.

‘Have I lost the confidence of the fans? No. But you always get a reaction from poorer results.’
