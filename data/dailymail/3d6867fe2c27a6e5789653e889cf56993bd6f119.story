A furious woman attacked her boyfriend with a club then left him for dead in a shallow grave in their garden last week.

After 17 hours underground, the man escaped and asked for help - but when he reported the crime to police, they arrested him on an outstanding warrant for attempted murder.

He is now in custody awaiting trial, while his girlfriend is on the run.

Josi Roberto Pereira, 37, and Graciele Tomaz, 25, had a blazing row on Sunday evening at their home in Marilac in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, according to police.

Grave: This is where Josi Roberto Pereira was buried alive by his girlfriend Graciele Tomaz in Marilac, Brazil

After Pereira fell asleep, Tomaz started beating him with a club, then tied him up with bedsheets and buried him in a 1m-deep grave.

He was shocked to wake up and find he was surrounded by soil, but because his girlfriend had left part of his face uncovered he was still able to breathe.

Tomaz, his girlfriend of three years, had also apparently stolen a mobile phone and the equivalent of Â£65 in cash from him.

Pereira visited his local police station to report the crime, but when police ran his name through the computer they discovered a 14-year-old warrant for his arrest.

He was promptly arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

The victim-turned-suspect later took the police to the grave in his garden and demonstrated how he had managed to escape his plight.

Sergeant Paulo Cezar da Silva said: 'Because she is a very strong woman, it is possible she acted alone in hitting him and digging the grave. But we are awaiting the results of the investigation.'

Another policeman, Gilberto Oliveira, said the situation was highly unusual.

'I know of other cases where people have filed a complaint with police and we have found they have an outstanding arrest warrant,' he said. 'But I've never seen someone buried alive by a woman before.'

Pereira's mother Conceigco Maria Romano de Jesus Pereira said the couple often fought, adding: ' I can't believe such a thing happened.

'I'm just so glad he got his face out and managed to breathe. Thank God he survived the blows and then survived when he was buried alive.'
