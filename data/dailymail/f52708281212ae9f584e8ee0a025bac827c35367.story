Sweet ban: Public health minister Anna Soubry calls for supermarkets to stop the 'guilt lanes'

Supermarkets and newsagents are to be told to abolish so-called ‘guilt lanes’ which see shoppers tempted with fattening sweets and treats at checkouts.

Public health minister Anna Soubry told the Daily Mail cynical store layouts were particularly difficult for parents with young children, adding: ‘Retailers should make it easier for us to make the right choices, not harder.’

The Department of Health is drawing up plans for a new industry code of practice on the marketing of products high in fat, sugar and salt.

It will call on stores to commit to changing layouts to end ‘guilt lanes’, ending cheap multi-buy deals on fattening products, and a commitment to spend a fixed proportion of their marketing budgets on promoting healthier options.

The new code may also restrict the use of cartoon characters, aimed at youngsters, on unhealthy products.

The Government has also negotiated plans for a ‘traffic light’ labelling system on the front of packaging that will indicate the levels of fat, sugar and salt.

Ministers say they want to focus on voluntary ‘responsibility deals’ with retailers rather than imposing ‘nanny state’ measures in law.

Miss Soubry, who is tipped for promotion in a forthcoming Government reshuffle, said she was particularly concerned about shelves near tills being stacked with purchases such as sweets and chocolate.

‘Supermarket checkouts and newsagents can be really tough for parents with their young children. While we all need to take responsibility for our own health and that of our children, things are not helped when tempting treats are put on show when you stand in line waiting to pay,’ she said.

Miss Soubry added: ‘We all know why they are there and we all know that they can work. If you haven’t been nagged by your own children while you wait then I’m sure you have seen it happen to someone else.

‘Through the responsibility deal we are making  progress in reducing calories and cutting unhealthy ingredients from our foods.

“It is worrying however, that some supermarkets and shops continue to influence people – especially young children - to pick up sweets and chocolate whilst waiting at the checkout.

‘We all need to take responsibility for our own health and the health of our children. But food manufacturers and retailers also bear a responsibility and I hope they will play their part by taking tough action to help us all live longer healthier lives.’

Since it launched the responsibility deal approach in 2011, ministers have struck agreements with stores that mean 70 per cent of fast food and takeaway meals sold now have calories clearly labelled.

All of the major supermarkets have committed to removing artificial ‘trans fats’ from their products, and  over 70 per cent of the retail market and over half of the major high street and contract caterers are committed to further reductions in salt in over 80 categories of foods - such as bread, soups, cereals and pasta sauces.

More than 30 major alcohol companies have committed to removing a billion units from sale. The initiative, which includes brands such as Echo Falls, First Cape and Heineken will see a greater choice of lower strength alcohol products and smaller measures by 2015.

A source added: ‘Although this is great progress we know there is still much more that can be done.

‘In the fight against obesity one action we are considering to ensure that people are not led astray by unhealthy products is creating guilt free checkouts – removing all unhealthy food from the last purchasing opportunity.

‘It has been proven that whilst waiting in a queue, people are more likely to pick up impulse purchases. Removing sweets, chocolate and fizzy drinks will encourage everyone – especially children – to pick up healthier alternatives.

‘We have shown the voluntary approach can work with reductions in fat, calories and salt in foods, and through new consistent front of pack food labelling – which all the major supermarkets and some of the big manufacturers signed up to.’

In England, 16.3 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese and 13.7 per cent of children aged two to 15 are overweight – making them far more likely to develop health conditions like type two diabetes and heart disease.

Among the worst offenders visited by the Mail were:

M & S: Shoppers forced to queue in a snaking aisle fenced in by racks of snacks. On child-height shelves were rows of Percy Pig and Colin Caterpillar sweets.

W H SMITH: Garish signs advertising three Wispa bars for £1 and two-for-£2 Coca Cola bottles. Checkout assistants often presented customers with further offers.

POUNDLAND: Five-foot walls of boxes of sweets and chocolates led to the checkout.

PRIMARK: Sweets such as Haribo, Chewits, Mentos and Polos on offer at £1 for five packets sat beside socks and underwear at the queues for the tills.

SAINSBURY’S: Most large branches had few sweets on display at main tills, but self-checkout customers were funnelled through temptation to reach the units. At convenience-style ‘Local’ stores, customers were met with rows of mints and chocolate bars before they could get to the checkouts.

BOOTS: Sweets and snacks such as crisps had a  prominent place on the way to the tills.
