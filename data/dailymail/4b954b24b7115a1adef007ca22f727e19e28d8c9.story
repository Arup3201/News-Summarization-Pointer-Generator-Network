Former suspect Robert Murat was questioned for more than four hours today at an Algarve police station over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

The IT consultant, 41, was driven away from Faro Police Station late lunchtime along with his lawyer Francisco Pagarete after answering questions as a witness.

It was the second time in three days he had attended the station.

Police were due to quiz the British expat on Wednesday but ran out of time after interviewing his German-born wife Michaela Walczuch, 38, as a witness.

He was the last of ten men and women - four Brits, a German and five Portuguese nationals - quizzed as witnesses this week on the Algarve at Scotland Yard’s request.

A British woman described as the wife of one of the Portuguese witnesses is also understood to have been questioned in the UK.

There was no immediate word on what Mr Murat had been asked or replied.

The interviews were conducted behind closed doors and Mr Pagarete declined to comment.

Michaela did not return to the police station with her husband today.

There was no sign either of Operation Grange boss Andy Redwood or DCI Nicola Wall, who is due to take charge of the British police probe into Madeleine’s disappearance when he retires later this month.

The police quiz of Mr Murat, made a formal suspect or arguido days after Madeleine went missing on May 3 2007 before being cleared a year later, had been expected to last until much later in the day.

Mr Murat, who is not suspected of any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, said last month when it emerged he was facing questioning that he was happy to cooperate.

Speaking before he received his official notification, he said: 'My conscience is clear and I have no problem speaking to police again.'

Michaela, Mr Murat's girlfriend when Madeleine vanished, was questioned three times as a witness after the youngster's disappearance.

A Portuguese lorry driver later came forward to say he had seen a blonde woman he said resembled estate agent Michaela passing a blanket containing a child to a man on an Algarve farm the day after Madeleine vanished.

A Spanish woman also claimed she had spotted her in a town in northern Morocco in June 2007, moments after she had seen a girl who looked just like Madeleine.

Michaela, whose home was searched by Portuguese police after Madeleine disappeared, complained of being treated like dirt by detectives and claimed Kate and Gerry McCann's former detective agency Metodo 3 had cynically used her.

Protesting her innocence in a December 2007 interview with a UK newspaper, she said: 'I lost my faith not just in justice but in the whole system and everyone that supports it.

'The worst part is people putting me in this, knowing I have nothing to do with it.

'They have no feelings, no heart. They are completely empty.

'When Robert called me to tell me that there was a story about these sightings I went into town and I just saw my face on the front of all the papers. I felt sick.

'I just wanted to scream 'I didn't do it'.

The police quizzes taking place this week are the first since four men were questioned as arguidos at the start of July.

All four - who included Russian businessman Sergey Malinka and a schizophrenic heroin addict - insisted they had nothing to do with Madeleine McCann's disappearance.

British police believe Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished.

Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where the youngster vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body - but failed to yield any clues.
