The vast majority of adults have no idea how much saturated fat they should eat every day, a poll suggests.

Some 84 per cent of adults do not know that men should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat each day and women should eat no more than 20g, the survey found.

The poll, conducted by supermarket Sainsbury’s, also found that one in five adults think that all types of fat are bad for one’s health.

And 66 per cent of the 2,000 UK adults surveyed admitted they were confused by different types of fat.

The news comes as health officials announced that almost half of the food manufacturing and retail industry in the UK has signed up to a pledge to reduce the amount of saturated fat in their products.

A number of companies, including Sainsbury’s, have pledged to change their recipes to reduce saturated fat levels.

Nestle has promised to change the recipe of its Kit Kat chocolate bars, Mondelez International is to ‘reformulate products across its portfolio’, including Oreos, and a number of supermarkets, including Tesco and Morrisons, will also reduce saturated fat in a number of products, a Department of Health spokeswoman said.

If the nation could cut the amount of saturated fat it eats by 15 per cent around 2,600 premature deaths from heart diseases could be prevented every year, she added.

The pledge is part of the Government’s ‘Responsibility Deal’ with the food industry which aims to curb the rising tide of obesity across the country by encouraging producers and retailers to reduce artificial trans fat, calories and salt in foods.

But Tam Fry, trustee of the National Obesity Forum, said that ministers must consider proper regulation instead of working with the industry on a voluntary basis.

‘It is a small step in the right direction but it is only a small step,’ he said.

‘This latest piece of hype from the Department of Health will mean over 50 per cent of food will still have extreme levels of saturated fat.

‘The much vaunted voluntary Responsibility Deal will never succeed until the Government takes a grip and makes everybody sign up to it.’

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘One in six male deaths and one in nine female deaths are from coronary heart disease - this is why it’s critical that we challenge the way we eat and that we all make changes where we can.

‘It’s hugely encouraging that companies providing almost half of the food available on the UK market have committed to this new Responsibility Deal pledge and they are leading the way to give their customers healthier products and lower fat alternatives.’
