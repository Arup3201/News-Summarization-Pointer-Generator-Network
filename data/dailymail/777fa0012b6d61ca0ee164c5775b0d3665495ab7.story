Eleven soldiers, including a two-star general, are being quarantined at a US Army garrison in Italy for 21 days after returning from an Ebola aid mission in Liberia. 

The troops are  the first wave American military personnel sent to disease-ravaged West Africa and thousands of US service members could potentially face 21 days in isolation before being allowed to return home. 

Among those being held in quarantine at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy, is Major General Darryl K Williams, the commander of US Army Africa who personally led the first part of the military's aid mission in Liberia, CBS News reports.

Providing aid: The US military is building a hospital and several testing stations around Liberia and helping with logistics for health workers in the country

The United States, Britain and France have all sent resources to West Africa to combat the spread of Ebola after the disease infected more than 10,000 people and killed more than 5,000

It is not yet clear whether all troops who are sent to West Africa will be forced to spend 21 days in quarantine. However, President Barack Obama has committed up to 5,000 military personnel to help stop the spread of the deadly virus, which has sickened more than 10,000 and killed nearly 5,000 people.

Today, the CDC updated its policy and recommended only a voluntary quarantine for high-risk Americans returning from West Africa. This comes despite several states, including New York and New Jersey, initially demanding mandatory quarantine for returning health care professionals.  

The American troops were met by Italian carabinieri military police wearing full hazmat gear as they landed at the Army base in norther Italy - about 45 miles west of Venice, CBS reports.  

Major General Gary J Volesky, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, is now on the ground in Liberia after assuming command of the growing US military presence in the country on Saturday. 

 A 25-bed hospital for infected health care workers in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, should be fully operational by the first week of November. The facility will be staffed by American doctors and nurses. 

The military has also set up testing labs across the country.  

Up to 5,000 US troops will be sent to Liberia to help international doctors and Liberian health officials combat the disease. The military has said they are at low risk of being exposed to Ebola

About 600 US service members are currently on the ground now in Liberia and thousands more have been committed to fight the disease. 

'You need our support demonstrated with action not words, and action is exactly what we are going to provide,' Maj Gen Volesky said. 

One hundred American troops had left from the base in Vicenza to help with logistics of fighting the outbreak in Liberia. They were checked twice a day for any contagion while on assignment.

While they were away the mayor of Vincenza, Achille Variati, had requested the Italian government to prevent any contact between the military and the towns people on their return.

The mayor had said: 'On their return they must not be contact between the military and the civilian population for three weeks. 'They cannot leave their barracks for all the period of incubation three weeks. To be sure of this the soldiers must be monitored during this period.'

The city has a troubled relationship with the American military after several rapes of local women allegedly by military, and an incident in which three drunk soldiers allegedly ran over and injured a group of pedestrians.

Responding to rumours that some of the soldiers were infected with ebola, the mayor said today: 'The Prefect and the military authorities have assured me that all the American soldiers returned from Africa are healthy. Not a single one has symptoms of ebola. They are all being constantly monitored, according to official protocol.'

The military has said soldiers in West Africa will not be in direct contact with Ebola patients and that their risk is very low. All personnel who spend time in West Africa are also required to monitor their temperatures to ensure that they have not caught the disease.

Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people.  

However, the quarantine in Italy reveals that the Department of Defense is stepping its precautions in the wake of Dr Craig Spencer show symptoms of the illness after returning to New York following aid work in Guinea. He went out to restaurants, rode the subway and hit up a bowling alley in Brooklyn before coming down with symptoms.
