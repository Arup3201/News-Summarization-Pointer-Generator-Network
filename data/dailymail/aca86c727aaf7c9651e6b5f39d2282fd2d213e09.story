Queen Victoria once wrote that it was 'impossible to imagine a prettier spot' than her beloved Osborne House.

And now two luxury cottages are opening in the grounds of the long-reigning monarch's favourite holiday spot in the Isle of Wight.

The two cottages are located at Sovereign Gate, the ceremonial entrance to the royal house once used exclusively by Queen Victoria and her family as well as visiting lords, ladies and heads of state.

Now: English Heritage are opening up two luxury cottages within Sovereign Gate at Osborne

The two self-catering cottages sleep up to four people each and retain  original features such as high ceilings, fireplaces and sash windows.

Decorated in a muted manner they are comfortable with  sparkling kitchens and bathrooms and surrounded by history.

From this month guests can book a three, four or seven night stay at Sovereign Gate, with rates starting from £402 for a three-night weekend stay.

Wander around Osborne's grounds, Queen Victoria's private beach and gardens, or enjoy free entry to other English Heritage sites on the Isle of Wight.

Osborne House was commissioned in the 1840s by Prince Albert as a seaside retreat for Queen Victoria and their children. 

Sovereign's Gate was the proud entrance designed to impress visiting dignitaries including Emperor Napoleon III, Tsar Nicholas and the Royal family itself.

The gate was also the site of departures, and none more dramatic than Queen Victoria's final journey from Osborne, after her death in 1901. 

It was through Sovereign's Gate that the Queen left her seaside home for the last time, and where the crowds outside had their first glimpse of her funeral cortege.

Tim Rogers, English Heritage Holiday Cottages Manager said: 'We are delighted to launch two luxury English Heritage holiday cottages in the stunning, historic location of Osborne. 

'From this week visitors will have the chance to retrace Queen Victoria's footsteps staying within the exclusive Sovereign's Gate and enjoying exclusive access to her private estate.

'Osborne House was one of Queen Victoria's favourite family homes and she once exclaimed that 'it was impossible to imagine a prettier spot.' We hope visitors will also enjoy the peaceful setting and take their place in the island's royal history.' 

English Heritage offers a collection of 18 historic holiday cottages across the country ranging from a 13th century tower at Dover Castle to lodges overlooking the iconic settings of Rievaulx Abbey and Pendennis Castle.
