Lewis Hamilton made the most of his last day off before beginning the final round of F1 testing as he attended the Brit Awards in London on Wednesday night.

The reigning Formula One champion, who was taken ill during F1 testing last Thursday, looked in good spirits at the O2 Arena as he made the most of his time away from the track.

The 30-year-old, who a day earlier attended the Elle Style Awards in London, was also on hand to present Taylor Swift with her award for International Female Artist of the year alongside Ellie Goulding.

Hamilton returns to the track on Thursday as testing resumes for the final time before the new season gets underway next month.

The F1 ace, who won the title by 67 points last year, will be looking to get the new campaign underway in positive style, with the first race taking place in Melbourne on March 15.

Hamilton will be hoping for an altogether different performance in this year's Australian Grand Prix though, after being forced to retire on lap three of the same course last year.

Meanwhile, Hamilton has revealed his love for music by posting a picture of himself in a studio with the caption: 'Other than being in a car, this is my favourite place to be. My fortress of solitude. #Music #TeamLH.'
