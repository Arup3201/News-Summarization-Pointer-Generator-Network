Gill Bembridge wasn’t overly worried when she saw a slight swelling on the neck of her nine-year-old daughter Faye. 

She just thought Faye had swollen glands and was getting a cold.

But a few days later a friend pulled Gill aside and voiced concerns. 

Gill Bembridge thought her daughter Faye had swollen glands and was getting a cold, but instead the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency

‘He’s a retired GP called Pete Lansley, and he told me the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency,’ says Gill, 31, who also has a son, Tyler, eight. 

‘This wasn’t anything I’d thought of before.’

Far from being as innocuous as a cold, a lack of iodine can have a major impact on physical and mental health for adults and children.

Studies show it is becoming increasingly commonplace in this country — up to two in three British girls and women are thought to have low iodine levels.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says iodine deficiency is the biggest worldwide cause of mental impairment. 

It has been linked to low IQ, fatigue, miscarriage and problems with the thyroid — the gland in the neck that regulates metabolism and early development.

Since spotting Faye’s goitre (the name for a swelling at the front of the neck caused by iodine deficiency), Dr Lansley has noticed an increasing number of people in the street with goitres near his home in Yorkshire.

These swellings are in the middle of the neck and will move up when you swallow.

Goitre is the only obvious sign of iodine deficiency and the result of the thyroid gland enlarging. 

This is because the job of this gland is to produce the thyroid hormone, which it does using iodine. 

But if the body is not getting enough iodine, the gland expands to try to produce more thyroid on its own.

Serious cases of iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) — causing long-term health problems such as foggy thinking, memory loss and infertility.

Dr Lansley says: ‘I’ve started looking at people’s throats when I’m out and about, and I’ve discovered that quite a lot of people have goitres — the majority of whom are teenage girls.

‘When I was doing my medical training in the late Sixties, I was at a hospital in Ankara in Turkey and there were lots of people there suffering from goitres. 

'The biggest I saw was the size of a small melon.

‘But you don’t expect to see many in the UK. It does make you wonder if there’s some sort of deficiency problem here.’

‘Pete Lansley (a retired GP) suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week. Within a month the swelling had gone and Faye stopped taking the drops,' said Gill

Recent research also points to problems with iodine intake. One study, published in The Lancet last year, looked at iodine levels in urine samples from 100 pregnant women.

Expectant mums need more iodine than most people as its vital for foetal brain development. 

But two-thirds of the women in the study by Surrey and Bristol Universities were iodine deficient.

The children of these women had lower IQs by the age of eight and poor reading ability by age nine compared with those born to the mothers with adequate iodine.

Meanwhile, another study, in The Lancet in 2011, involved more than 700 teenage girls from across the UK and revealed 70 per cent of them had iodine deficiency. One in five had a ‘very low’ level.

Teenage girls need more iodine, too, for breast and ovary development. 

As a result of this study, the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders placed the UK on the list of mildly deficient nations.

The Department of Health has now added iodine to its National Diet and Nutrition Survey, which checks the nutrient intake of adults and children in UK. 

It will look at the results next year and decide whether steps need to be taken to increase the nation’s iodine intake.

So why are our levels so low?

Most of the world’s iodine is found in the oceans — seafood, seaweed, cod and scallops are especially rich sources. 

But in the UK, cows’ milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt are our main source.

This is due to a lucky accident: iodine is used as a disinfectant to clean cows’ udders and added to their feed, so it has entered our food chain this way.

But consumption slumped when free school milk ended in the Seventies. 

And it has fallen further in recent years due to allergy fears and our changing tastes.

Organic milk, which has grown in popularity, has around 40 per cent less iodine due to the different farming processes.

Dr Mark Vanderpump, the consultant endocrinologist at the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust who led the 2011 research, says: ‘In our study it seemed that the girls who weren’t having any milk were the ones who were losing a big part of their iodine supplementation.

‘Before we did the study we thought we might be looking at iodine toxicity — too much iodine from milk — but the opposite was true.’

The recommended daily intake of iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) for adults — 250 mcg for pregnant women. Children should have around 120 mcg.

A 100g portion of shellfish provides 90mcg, and a 200ml glass of milk has 50-80 mcg. So it’s easy to see how shortfalls arise.

The UK Iodine Group, formed by Dr Vanderpump, is pressing the Government for a solution to Britain’s deficiency. 

In many countries, including Canada, the U.S., Denmark and Switzerland, salt manufacturers have been required to add iodine to their products since the 1920s. 

This is thought to be the simplest and most effective way of improving population-wide intake.

Recently, WHO added iodine to the salt in India to help improve levels there. 

But there are no plans to iodise salt here.

‘As soon as you even mention salt in Britain, people start talking about high blood pressure and strokes,’ says Dr Vanderpump. 

‘That’s why I think the Government doesn’t want to intervene, because it’s always easier to leave the status quo.

‘It’s ironic that we fund programmes to iodise the salt of Third World countries, yet we don’t bother about our own.’

The UK Iodine Group believes we should prioritise efforts to boost the iodine intake of teenage girls — the mothers of the future.

‘You could say, “Why don’t we focus on pregnant women?” but the problem is that only 50 per cent of pregnancies are planned, and you need your iodine and thyroid status to be good pre-conception, as the foetal brain develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy.

‘If you suddenly start taking iodine supplements when you’re six weeks’ pregnant, it might not be good for you. 

'Your thyroid takes a while to adjust and it could harm it if you take too much iodine too quickly.

‘Another argument for focusing on teenagers is a New Zealand study that found your brain doesn’t finish forming until you’re about 15. 

The drop in UK milk consumption over the last decade

'They gave 12 year olds iodine for six months and it improved their mental functioning.’

So what should you do if you fear your iodine levels are low?

The usual test is via a urine sample. But Dr Vanderpump warns that this may not be accurate. 

‘Results vary widely according to recent diet so are not useful to assess someone’s iodine status,’ he says.

If you have a goitre you should see your GP, who may refer you to an endocrinologist for thyroid assessment. Adequate iodine supplies should reduce the swelling.

Dr Vanderpump says the only way to ensure your iodine levels are adequate is to consume more milk and dairy products. 

‘Or you can add an over-the-counter potassium iodine supplement of 100-150mcg per day.’

Yet when Gill took Faye to her GP to ask for an iodine supplement she was brushed off.

‘We were told that at Faye’s age there are so many hormonal changes going on, the lump would probably go,’ says Gill, who lives in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.

‘But Pete suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week.’ 

Within a month the swelling had gone and Faye stopped taking the drops.

Gill now ensures her children have plenty of milk and iodine-rich food. 

‘I count us very lucky that we have Pete as a friend. 

'If it wasn’t for him Faye’s iodine status would have gone unnoticed.’
