Well you don't see THIS every day.

A hybrid part-sheep, part-goat animal - or 'geep' - has been born on a farm in Ballymore Eustace in Ireland's County Kildare.

The proud lamb/kid's owner, Paddy Murphy, has described his farm's newest addition as 'unbelievable' and 'an unusual character'.

Not planned, and certainly 'unusual': Farmer Paddy Murphy is the proud owner of a new hybrid part-sheep, part goat

Mr Murphy didn't plan rare geep, either, and said it was the accidental product of a union between a goat and a Cheviot ewe - something he spotted with his own eyes five months ago.

But he forgot all about it - until now.

'I've never seen anything like him before,' he said, BBC World reports.

'[It's a] pure shock to the system... a one-off.'

The little geep is quick, too, Mr Murphy says, and the other farm animals are struggling to keep up with the little guy.

'He's so fast you'd have to get him into the pen to catch him,' he said.  

Mr Murphy says he plans to raise the 'geep' more as a lamb than a goat, though it's developing horns

'There's no chance you would catch him otherwise.

'He's unbelievable.'

You can say that again.

Mr Murphy says he plans to raise the 'geep' more as a lamb than a goat, though it's developing horns.

And for now, he's just calling him the 'geep'.

'We've no name set up yet, no,' he added. 'We might look for one.'
