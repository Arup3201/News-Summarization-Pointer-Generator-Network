A sports car driven by Paul Walker in Fast & Furious is to go under the hammer for up to £4million.

The heavily modified R34 Nissan Skyline goes on the market almost exactly a year after he was killed in a fireball with friend Roger Rodas when the Porsche he was a passenger in crashed in Valencia, California. 

The ultramarine-blue Skyline zoomed through the streets of LA in the fourth instalment of the blockbuster franchise that was released in 2009.

Iconic: The late Paul Walker, in his role as FBI agent Brian O'Conner, speeds the car (pictured with it during filming) through Los Angeles in a street race but is pipped to the post by Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto

German owner Peter Kolbeck is open to offers for the unique motor but expects it to go for between £600,000 and £4million.

One of a kind: Although the racy blue motor is one of nine Skylines used in the film, it's the only actual Skyline as the others used were stunt cars fitted on VW Beetle chassis' with plastic bodies

GTR: For their money any buyer would receive a 40-page appraisal from an accredited appraisal company documenting the car's build and history

A steal: With just under 4000 miles on the clock it would be a steal for its lower estimate.

Power: Under the bonnet is a twin-turbo 2.6-litre straight-six engine with a Turbonetics front-mounted intercooler

Lavish: It has no rear seats, a Momo Alcantara steering wheel (pictured), Nismo pedals and a custom head up display for a dash-mounted PC

Popular: Fast and Furious was a hugely-popular film franchise, starring Walker (left, in a scene from 2011's Fast Five) and Vin Diesel (right), that centred around America's underground street-racing scene

Although the racy blue motor is one of nine Skylines used in the film, it's the only actual Skyline as the others used were stunt cars fitted on VW Beetle chassis with plastic bodies.

Under the bonnet is a twin-turbo 2.6-litre straight-six engine with a Turbonetics front-mounted intercooler and all four wheels receive around 550bhp  via a six-speed Getrag shifter.

The racing machine features Nismo lowering springs, a custom roll cage, an ARC titanium strut tower bar, Volk racing wheels, a Rotora big brake conversion, a Nismo bumper and side skirts, no rear seats, a Momo Alcantara steering wheel, Nismo pedals and a custom head up display for a dash-mounted PC.
