Liverpool have offered Steven Gerrard a new deal as they try to end the uncertainty over his future.

The 34-year-old, who could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January 1, is considering his options and will base his decision on whether he believes he can contribute regularly next season.

Brendan Rodgers has no doubt Gerrard will be a huge influence on the team and insisted money will have nothing to do with whatever decision the midfielder reaches.

Gerrard's advisors have met both Rodgers and chief executive Ian Ayre in the past month and Liverpool's manager insists he has earned the right to take his time.

Rodgers said: 'Steven has been offered a contract. He deserves the utmost respect and deserves time to consider that. It is a big moment to consider what he is going to do at this stage in his life. There are many things he has to think about but it certainly won't be money.'

Many believe Gerrard should be given a role at Anfield for life and Rodgers certainly sees him as someone who has the potential to become a coach in the future but, for the moment, he simply regards him as a vital member of his squad.

'He is still very much a player,' said Rodgers, who is expected to recall his captain at Leicester this evening. 'This is his concentration. When I see how he trains and works it is still about playing. Then maybe there is a role further down the line. To have someone like that beside you in a coaching capacity would be great.

‘At this moment it is purely about football. He’s 35 at the end of this season and still has a couple of years to play if he wants. There are many things at this stage he needs to factor in.’

When asked if he and Gerrard had a problem, Rodgers said: '150 per cent no. There is no problem. We have a fantastic relationship.'

He added: 'Listen, I love working with him. He is arguably the best player in the history of the Premier League. I saw some things yesterday that were unfortunate in terms of a rift between us. But one thing we have together is honesty and respect.

'It is not about the amount of games he will play now. It is the level of games he plays. No matter how good a player he has been, in the final few years you have to taper that.

'Everyone knows Steven's history here, what a player he has been. I need to focus that talent and utilise it in the games that he plays. He is a world-class talent.

'Steven, in terms of what he has done here, he deserves to concentrate on the team. It is just managing the period of his life that he is in. It reaches every player. It is not a problem. It is not an issue.

'All I can ever be is honest. That is how it will always be. He will be a key player here. I hope he will sign a contract.'

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini raised the prospect that he would be interested in signing Gerrard if he became a free agent and it is inevitable clubs in Europe, the Middle East and America, will be watching developments.

Rodgers told Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, why Gerrard should be awarded new terms and does not want to lose his services. 

When asked if he feared an approach from a Champions League club, Rodgers said: ‘I can only think about the situation here and I hope there is a solution with the club and his representatives. It is not about the money. It is about the time of his career in terms of playing. He is a big, big talent.’

VIDEO Gerrard denies Rodgers rift

After three straight Premier League defeats the result against Stoke was a much-needed boost for Rodgers. But the 41-year-old boss said his team's achievement had been overshadowed by talk of a bust-up between him and Gerrard.

Asked whether the victory could be a turning-point in their season Rodgers said: 'Stoke had come to Anfield looking to get a result. We didn't get back home until 4.30am on Thursday (after the Champions League draw at Ludogorets). I have a huge amount of respect for the way that we kept the clean sheet. 

'We have not had a great start to the season. But to get a win and see things written the day after of talk about a rift between the manager and the captain, it is very disappointing.'
