The Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict because there was 'sufficient evidence' that she killed her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

Judge Belvin Perry made the extraordinary admission in his first interview since the close of Anthony's trial nearly two years ago.

'There were two sides to Casey Anthony,' Perry told NBC's Today Show. 'There was the side that was before the jury, where she portrayed the role of a mother who had lost a child - someone who was wrongfully accused. And then you could notice the change and transformation in her when the jury went out.

'She was very commanding, she took charge of different things, and you could see her sometimes scolding her attorneys.'

Perry said he believes the jury let the young mother off the hook for 
first-degree murder because she was 'very manipulative' and had an 
extraordinarily personable lawyer.

The jury handed down its 'not guilty' 
verdict in July of 2011. At the moment that he read the verdict from the
jury, Perry described feeling 'surprise,' 'shock' and 'disbelief.'

'Wrong' verdict: Perry said 'There was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case'

He said he had to read the verdict twice in his head to make sure he had read it correctly.

Perry was surprised because he believed 'there was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case,' he said.

He also felt that prosecutors had 'proved a great case.'

'But you’ve got to realize this was a circumstantial evidence case,' he added. 'All the defense had to do was create that reasonable doubt, and that’s what they did.'

Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez, played a large role in swaying the jury's opinion of her innocence, Perry said. 

'The state had better lawyers, but Mr. Baez was very personable,' he said. 'He came across as someone that you would like.

'It’s like someone trying to sell a used car. Who are you going to buy it from? The most likeable salesperson.'

Anthony wasn't quite as personable as her lawyer, but she could put on a good front before the jury, Perry said.

'There was always two sides to Casey,' he said. There was the public persona that she wanted the jury to see and there was that side that she showed when the jury was not there.'

He specifically recalled a day when Anthony fought 
with her lawyers over a suggestion that she take a plea deal for 
aggravated manslaughter instead of first-degree murder.

'Car salesman:' Perry compared Baez (pictured) to a used car salesman as he described how the lawyer persuaded the jury into thinking Anthony was innocent

'I will never forget that day,' he said, noting that he was in earshot of the conversation while she was in a holding cell.

'All of a sudden, you heard shouting coming from the holding cell, some four-letter words coming from the holding cell, and she was quite upset,' he said. 'So upset that one counselor suggested that she was incompetent to proceed.'

Anthony's trial was televised and made into a spectacle as one of the most sensational stories of the year, sparking protests, drawing huge crowds to the courtroom and attracting international news coverage.

'I had no earthly idea that it would 
command the attention that it did worldwide,' Perry said. 'It was truly a
fantastic experience.'

He said he didn't think that the 
cameras in the courtroom - which are permitted by Florida state law - 
had affected the outcome of her trial.

'In Florida we've always had cameras and I think people need to know how their justice system works,' he said.

The jury found Anthony guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. She was released from jail on July 17, 2011.

In January of this year, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts.

Asked whether justice has been served in Anthony's case, Perry said that remains to be determined.

'Well justice has been served in the sense that the jury has spoken,' he said. 'But justice will finally be served one day by the judge of judges. And she will have to live with this and deal with this for the rest of her life.'
