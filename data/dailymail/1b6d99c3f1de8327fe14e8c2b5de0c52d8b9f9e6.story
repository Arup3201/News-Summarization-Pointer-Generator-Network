Two schoolboys caught with 75 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine as they queued for breakfast in a McDonald's have been spared prison - because they're just 15-years-old.

The teenagers were searched by police after CCTV operators said they were 'acting suspiciously’ and 'exchanging glances' in a shopping centre.

They had £750 in drugs and £220 in cash on them along with a mobile phone that had been used earlier that day to sell drugs to addicts.

The pair, who cannot be named, admitted 
possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bolton Crown Court but were spared jail 
because of their ages.

Arrested: Two schoolboys were caught with 75 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine as they about to order breakfast at McDonald's at the Millgate shopping centre (pictured) in Bury, Greater Manchester

The two schoolboys were arrested at 10.15am in a McDonald's in Mill Gate at the Rock Centre in Bury while on their school summer holidays on August 7 last year.

Simon Barrett, prosecuting, said: 'Police officers attended the McDonald's restaurant in Bury following reports of two males acting suspiciously.

'They searched them under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Officers found on them wraps of both crack cocaine and heroin and also cash.

'They had also dropped a phone - it was clearly a dealer’s phone and contained text messages consistent with dealing drugs.'

The court heard how the two boys were acting as drug runners and had been promised commission if they managed to get rid of the stash.

One of the boys was carrying 10 wraps of crack cocaine and 19 wraps of heroin while the other teenager had 14 wraps of crack cocaine and 32 wraps of heroin.

The court heard the £200 cash was from drug deals they'd made earlier that day.

Mr Barrett added: 'They had taken the drugs off a third party and they were being paid to sell it on.

'The money was from drug dealing, they had been selling the drugs earlier that day - they made admissions when they were interviewed by the police.

The younger boy was told he would be paid £50 to help get rid of the supply while the older teenager had been promised £1.50 'commission' for every wrap he sold.

In mitigation, defence lawyers for 
the boys said they had never touched drugs or been involved in any 
previous drug-related crime.

Stuart Duke, who represented the younger of the two boys, said: 'These are extremely serious offences - when children, 15-year-old boys, are dealing crack cocaine and heroin - if my client was of adult age, he would serve four years imprisonment.

'Anything I say, doesn’t decry from the seriousness of the offence he’s pleaded guilty to.

'He’s never fallen foul of the criminal justice system before.

'He’s a young man who has learning difficulties; he attends a school for men with learning difficulties. He doesn’t really know what heroin and crack cocaine is.'

Passing sentence, the judge Mr Recorder Paul O’Brien handed the older boy, now 16, a 12-month youth rehabilitation order, a 12-month supervision requirement, an activity requirement and an electronically-tagged curfew between 7am and 7pm.

He ordered the younger defendant to complete a 12-month intensive referral order and to abide by a doorstep three-month curfew between 7am and 7pm.

Recorder O’Brien reminded the boys they would have been locked up for at least four years if they were adults. He added: 'You must understand how desperately seriously this is.'

Inspector Charlotte Cadden, speaking at the time of the incident, said: 'It is extremely saddening to see such young men caught red-handed with so many drugs.

'Drugs are a blight on our community and whether you are 15 or 50, dealing drugs is a very serious offence. We will continue to work closely with all our partner agencies and when we receive intelligence of possible drug dealing, we will take action.'
