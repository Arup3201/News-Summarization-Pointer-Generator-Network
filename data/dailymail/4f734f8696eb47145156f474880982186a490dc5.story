A West Australian woman has denied that she scammed pregnant mothers by selling them fake ultrasound pictures.

Rawinia Hayes, who ran Amazing 4D Imaging in WA's South West region, pleaded not guilty in Bunbury Magistrates' Court to 18 charges, including accepting payment but failing to deliver goods and making false or misleading representations, the ABC reports.

Ms Hayes was investigated by Consumer Protection last year after almost 80 complaints were received.

Scores of mothers-to-be cherished the images of babies they were told they were carrying in their wombs. Concerns arose when some of the women realised others had been provided with pictures of the same unborn chlidren.

Ms Hayes is alleged to have provided pregnant women with pictures of babies in the womb that were downloaded from the internet and claimed they were the same images the mothers-to-be had seen on ultrasound scans.

One of the mothers, Charlotte Shilcof, told Daily Mail Australia she was one of hundreds of women decieved by the scam. She was given photos by Amazing 4D Imaging and told they depicted her now two-year-old daughter Ava.

The 23-year-old from Bunbury in West Australia says that a video she received from the company appears to be real, but that photos sent to her were also sent to a number of other women who were at different stages of their pregnancies.

She told Daily Mail Australia that while the video she received appears to be real, the separate photos that were sent to her (pictured in a scrapbook she created) had also been sent to a number of other women

A real ultrasound picture of Ava before she was born, taken by a different radiologist, stands in stark contrast to the images she received from Amazing 4D Imaging

'I only found out they were fake when my daughter was about the age of one. Straight away I found three of the photos that I had put in our scrapbook album and saw them on the internet,' Ms Shilcof said. 

'I was quite hurt. We really trusted her and it was a special time in our life, being our first child, and it was very upsetting to think that they are photos that don't mean anything - I scrap-booked all of them.

'Most people are pretty angry, but everyone's' situation is different. There have been one or two women whose children didn't survive and things like that - and there are still people who are only just finding out now.

'At first I was angry that she even considered that she could plead not guilty and now it just makes me laugh. There are hundreds of us. How can you plead not guilty and say you haven't done something when there's proof that you have done it.'

Newborn Ava: Ms Shilcof said hundreds of the women who received the fake photos had joined a Facebook group. 'Everyone's' situation is different. There have been one or two women whose children didn't survive and things like that - and there are still people who are only just finding out now,' she said

'I was quite hurt. We really trusted her. It was a special time in our life, being our first child, and it was very upsetting to think that they are photos that don't mean anything. I scrap-booked all of them,' she said

Ms Shilcof (pictured with her husband and daughter in 2013) said she was angry when she first heard Ms Hayes had pleaded not guilty 

The Bunbury Mail reported that more than 100 people had joined a group set up for people who believed they had been given false ultrasound photos of their unborn children.  

The paper said the issue first came to light when a Bunbury woman posted her concerns on Facebook - which resulted in other women coming forward.

'We had an unprecedented 76 actual written complaints in relation to that issue,' Debbie Butler of Consumer Protection told the ABC in December.

Ms Hayes pleaded not guilty to 18 charges, including accepting payment but failing to deliver goods and making false or misleading representations, after allegedly supplying dozens of expectant mothers with fake 4D ultrasound photos

Running a business called Amazing 4D Imagining, Ms Hayes is accused of using images from the internet and giving them to clients

One mother, Catherine Osment, was said to have paid for an ultrasound DVD and photographs of her unborn baby but when she received the photographs it was 'clearly obvious' all eight images were of different babies.

'I knew as soon as I opened them they were fake and it made me feel sick,' she said.

She added that when she searched the internet she found the same photographs in Google Images. 

Further checks revealed the prints had been made before she had her scan.

Dozens of expectant mothers claim to have received the same pictures and are devastated they have been misled

Women shared images on Facebook to compare the pictures, finding many of them were copies of the same photographs

Her partner had even been planning to have the baby's image tattooed on his chest, but he cancelled the appointment when he realised the photo might not be of his child, she said.

Another mother, Jacinta Langford, said she believed an ultrasound photo of her twins had been lifted from Google Images.

The Bunbury paper reported the business owner, who could not be named at the time for legal reasons, as saying she was considering legal action for what she said were defamatory claims, adding that her work was legitimate and professional.

Women writing in response to the allegations expressed their horror and dismay with one commenting: 'What a terrible thing to do to people.'

Another wrote: 'OMG, this is absolutely horrible. I could only image the heartbreak these mothers must be feeling, having 2 kids of my own. My heart goes out to them.'

Yet another commentator wrote that it was 'heartbreaking watching these parents put 'their' little images up…and other parents are saying and posting 'their' own images EXACTLY THE SAME…it is a disgusting betrayal of trust.'

Others took to Facebook to share and compare images they believed to be duplicates of their own, and pictures which they all believed showed their own children.
