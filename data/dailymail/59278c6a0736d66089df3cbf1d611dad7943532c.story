A British adventurer has kayaked 1,300 miles across the Aleutian Islands completing the latest leg of her gruelling attempt to circumnavigate the globe just using human power.

Sarah Outen, 29, landed on the Homer Spit, Alaska earlier this month paddling her kayak Krissy with partner Justine Curgenven marking the end of a 101 day journey from Adak.

The Oxford graduate, MBE, has now travelled about 16,000 
miles - more than halfway around the globe - on her London2London 
expedition which she started on April 1, 2011, at Tower Bridge, London.

She did it! Adventurer Sarah Outen kayaked for 101 days to reach Homer Spit, Alaska in her kayak Krissy

After reaching land two weeks ago, Outen tapped the statue at the Seafarers Memorial.

She
 wrote on Twitter: 'Super super chuffed to make it to Homer today after 
an amazing kayaking adventure with my good pal Justine these last 101 
days.'

'Exhausted
 now. Muscles looking forward to a massage. Anchorage tomorrow to make 
Justine 's flight and I will have a week off before heading back to 
Homer to start the bike east.'

Outen spent most of the trip in relative solitude with Curgenven, enduring many 12 hour days paddling, with just wildlife - including bears -  and scenery for company. One of the longest crossings between islands was 37 miles with other days spent tucked away in tents while heavy rain and wind passed.

After completing the marathon kayak Outen flew back to Oxfordshire to spend a week with her fiancée Lucy, 
28, before embarking on the next leg - cycling from Canada to New York
 City. She will then row home across the Atlantic to London.

She is expected to reach London, aboard her boat Happy Socks, in 2015.

Nerve-wracking: The pair were ecstatic when they reached dry land without having capsized at all

Speaking of 
her latest trip, she told MailOnline: 'The Alaskan leg of my 
London2London journey included some of the toughest and most beautiful 
moments of the whole expedition.

'The
 Aleutian Islands and Alaskan Peninsula are stunning to look at, magic 
to travel through and stacked with wildlife and very few people.

'I felt way out of my comfort zone for much of the journey and was happy to reach the end without a single capsize.

'It
 was great to travel with team mate Justine Crugenven - veritable 'Queen
 of Sea Kayaking'. I flew home to surprise my fiancée Lucy in time for 
her birthday and return to Homer, the end of the road, next week. I 
shall now begin the trans USA/Canada trek by bike.'

Outen has so far travelled 16,000 miles on her London2London expedition which began on April 1 2011

Breaking records: She became the first person to row solo from Japan to the Aleutian Islands - then the first to go from there to Alaska using just human power. She is pictured in her boat Happy Socks

Outen's first year - 2011 - saw her cycle and kayak more than 11,000 miles from London to Choshi, Japan.

She then became the first and youngest person to row solo the 3,750 nautical miles from Japan to the Aleutian Islands.

It took her 150 days to complete the voyage - which saw her propose to her girlfriend Lucy Allen, 27, on a satellite phone on the way.

Outen managed to complete the 101 day challenge without capsizing - and will now cycle across the USA

Outen
 started her round-the-world attempt in 2011 in London, but was stymied 
by a tropical storm in the North Pacific in 2012 when she had to be 
rescued by the Japanese Coastguard

But it wasn't all been plain-sailing.

The rower capsized five times during her journey and was confined to her cabin for days because of the perilous conditions.

Plummeting
 temperatures and poor light made rowing 'incredibly demanding', she 
said, and towards the end of the trip, she narrowly missed being struck 
by a cargo ship.

And
 in 2012, she was forced to abandon her initial a trip across the 
Pacific after she was caught in a tropical storm and had to be rescued 
by Japanese coastguards.

Her badly damaged her boat Gulliver was hit by 15-metre-high waves and 80mph winds.

Undeterred by the hair-raising encounters, she arrived back at the Aleutian Islands in April to continue her voyage.

Outen is aiming to raise more than £100,000 in sponsorship for her good causes - CoppaFeel!, The Jubilee Sailing Trust, MNDA and WaterAid.
