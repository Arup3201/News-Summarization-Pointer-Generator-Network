Wine may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of Luton, but the Bedfordshire town could soon find itself at the heart of Britain's answer to the Loire Valley.

Known more for its airport and once being voted Britain's worst place to live, the surrounding area could be the ideal spot to set up one of Europe's largest wine growing areas.

Thanks to hotter temperatures, grape harvests are set to boom with projected production already estimated to triple over the next 12 years.

And an area stretching from Slough to just north of Luton has been pinpointed by scientists as one of the best and biggest areas for new vineyards.

Another glass sir: Luton could become the heart of the UK's answer to the Loire Valley thanks to a surge in average temperatures

New rival? The UK's burgeoning wine industry could soon rival that of the fine wines produced in the Loire Valley in France

A study that combined satellite 
technology, soil analysis, climate and topography has found that large 
parts of the south of England, in the Chilterns and Sussex and in north 
Kent from Gravesend to Canterbury are now prime hotspots for potential 
new vineyards.

The burgeoning English wine industry has
been boosted by warmer temperatures which have provided better grape 
growing conditions and seen a surge in alcohol levels in wines produced 
here.

The increasingly warm climate has seen the 'potential alcohol' of English grapes, which is an indicator of the strength of wine they could make, has shot up from between five and seven per cent to between 12 and 14 per cent.

The alcohol potential of grapes is linked to their sugar content - which is all down to how much sun and warmth they are exposed to during cultivation.

Met Office records show that average daytime temperatures in July shot up from 21.19C between 1961 and 1990 to 22.01C in the period between 1981 and 2010.

On the up: Wine production is expected to rise from its current 2.5million bottles a year to 8million a year by 2025

Overnight temperatures also rose from 11.56C to 12.24C.

Warmer overnight temperatures mean that leaves heat up quicker in the morning and produce sugars for longer during the day.

Similar temperature rises occurred in every other month of the year.

London-based wine researcher Stephen Skelton told the Sunday Times that when he started out in the industry, English vineyards were growing varieties made to make wines such as Liebfraumilch, German-style wines that are not very popular among drinkers in the UK.

But since the 1990s, it has been possible to grow Pinot, chardonnay and meunier grapes - which produce more popular wines.

English winemaking has been rapidly expanding since 1989 when vineyards covered just 1,300 acres of the countryside.

That figure had increased almost threefold to 3,700 acres by this summer.

Around 2.5million bottles of English wine are currently produced every year, but that figure could double in the next two years and could hit 8million by 2025 with the biggest market in sparkling wines.

Mike Roberts, co-founder of the Ridgeview Wine Estate in East Sussex told the Sunday Times: 'A key measure is the number of days you get where the temperatures rise above 29C.

'We have seen some bad years, but there is a clear trend. If it continues then there is a bright future for English wine.'

Giant vineyards are now popping up in the English countryside - a prime example being the opening of the 300 acre Rathfinny Estate in Sussex.

But the weather is not guaranteed. Nyetimber, England's largest vineyard, decided not to harvest its crop last year after bad weather conditions left the quality so poor.
