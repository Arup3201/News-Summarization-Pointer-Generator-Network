It seems cats the world over have trouble judging what size holes they can fit through.

This adventurous feline had to be rescued by firefighters in Italy after it tried to squeeze through a small hole in a storage container.

It comes days after a British cat had to be rescued after it too got its head stuck -Â  but this time in a can of cat food.

Not the purrfect escape: A cat trapped inside a metal container tried to escape through a tiny hole but ended up getting trapped

The head of the distressed Italian moggie was spotted by a neighbour in Bolzano, northern Italy.

The well-fed feline managed to squeeze its face through the hole in the side of a storage container, but couldn't wriggle its body through the small gap.

People walking past could just see a cats head protruding from the container, but nothing else.

Firefighters spent an hour carefully cutting through the metal unit until it was wide enough for the feline to get through.

Stuck: The inquisitive feline misjudged the size of its body when it tried to squeeze through the hole in the metal container

Carefully does it: Firefighters in Bolzano, northern Italy took care not to harm the cat when they cut through the container to free it

'We think it must have slipped in while the door was open and then got trapped inside,' said one firefighter.

'A neighbour called us after seeing it looking very sorry for itself with its head stuck through the wall.

'It wasn't hurt so after a quick check with the vet we let it go,' they added.
