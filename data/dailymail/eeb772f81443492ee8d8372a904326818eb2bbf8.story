Dr Ian Duncan (pictured) said his methods of communicating with animals are based on science

The tales of Dr Dolittle have captured imaginations since the books were written nearly 100 years ago.

And now one Scottish scientists claims he can do just that using a 'strictly scientific method'.

After years of research, Dr Ian Duncan will reveal his methods of communicating with pets and livestock at a conference next week.

He started his work wanting to ask animals questions to check that they were happy with their living conditions and that they were being well cared for.

Dr Duncan, Emeritus Chair in animal welfare at the University of Guelph, Canada, said his methods of communicating with creatures great and small are based on science, although he has acknowledged similarities to the character of Dr Dolittle, The Belfast Telegraph reported.

‘We are devising ways of “talking” to animals and putting questions to them about their welfare and happiness,’ he told The Sunday Times.

‘Each species has to be treated differently but the common factor is to devise tests where the animals are offered a choice.

‘If they make the same choice repeatedly...it shows what they want from us.’

The scientist will reveal his methods at a conference about animal welfare and sentience taking place in Washington next week, after spending years working with a number of pets and livestock species.

Dr Duncan is interested in fundamental questions concerning the nature of sentience - the ability of animals to feel sensations - and its relationship to welfare.

He is also committed to finding solutions to farm animal welfare problems through more applied research.

His work in the 1980s and 1990s led to changes in the regulation of battery farms for hens and pigs.

He has also spoken out against the religious slaughter of animals, used to produce kosher and halal meat as he believes livestock animals, from farmed fish to sheep, are smarter than people give them credit for.

Dr Duncan said: 'It used to be thought that animals were ‘dumb’, driven by programmed instincts and responses, but now it is clear they live a much richer life than we ever realised and can remember the past and think about the future.

‘We can use that knowledge to ask questions about their care and then improve it.’

The No More Woof headset uses brain-scanning technology to detect a dog's thought patterns, analyse them and translate them into words

For dog owners eager to know what their pet is thinking, a prototype gadget could take pet-to-human communication to the next level.

The No More Woof headset uses brain-scanning technology to detect a dog's thought patterns, analyse them and translate them into the spoken word.

It has been developed by the Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery (NCID), a small Scandinavian research lab.

Potential dog phrases already identified by the developers include: 'This is splendid!', 'Leave me alone', 'I am so very weary', 'Who are you?' and 'Erm, why are you guys leaving?'

The technology used in No More Woof is a combination of the latest technologies in three different tech-areas, Electroencephalography (EEG) sensoring, micro-computing and special brain-computer interface software.

In the last decade, huge discoveries have been made to map out the human brain’s functions, but the developers say it is the first time anyone made a serious attempt to apply this ground-breaking technology on man’s best friend.
