Yossi Benayoun has branded Joey Barton 'stupid' and 'embarrassing' in response to a tweet he made about the Middle East crisis.

Benayoun, who played alongside Barton during a spell on loan at Queens Park Rangers last season, captained Maccabi Haifa in their friendly against Lille in Austria earlier this week which had to be abandoned when pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch and fought with players.

Israel is currently engaged in hostilities with Hamas, an Islamist militant group that runs the Gaza Strip.

'If this was anybody else but Israel the West would intervene,' said Barton in one of a number of tweets posted on Friday morning.

'It cannot continue. Innocent children being slaughtered. This must stop.

'How can a God stand by and watch this? Or even condone this? Is this all part of his master plan?

'The UN attempting to evacuate the school when the bombing took place? Asked IDF (The Israel Defense Force) for window to evacuate. Not given. Children die as a result. 

'This is not war. These are not combatants. They are just innocent children. This is ethnic cleansing.'

Benayoun, who was born in Israel and has almost 100 caps for the national team, responded to Barton's rant against Israeli actions in Gaza, saying: 'Mate things can never changed you have been stupid and you will stay stupid all your life..embarrassing .'

Barton replied: 'Firstly, you cannot call somebody stupid with such bad grammar. Secondly, you cannot and should not kill innocent children. Thirdly, you cannot remove people from their land because a fictional book from thousands of years ago tells you can. Last but not least, I hope you and your family are safe and well and remain so through this terrible time.'

Continuing with his posts, Barton added: 'Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?'

Twitter: Joey Barton, training for Queens Park Rangers on Friday, voiced his opinions on the Middle East crisis

On Wednesday, and with French side Lille winning 2-0, supporters of reportedly Turkish origin entered the pitch and headed for Maccabi Hafia players, including Benayoun, formerly of West Ham Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.

One of the players is seen to trip a fan before punches were thrown. The Maccabi stars - some of whom retaliated - managed to leave the field unhurt.

Commenting on the incident, Benayoun, 34, said: 'As a football club we condemn all acts of verbal and physical violence.

'Yesterday (on Wednesday) in the closing minutes of the match we were attacked by thugs on the pitch simply because we are Israelis. We had no choice but to defend ourselves.'

He continued: 'The older players saw it as our duty to defend the youth players and we asked them not to become involved in the brawl.

'As a team we are one unit who defend each other for better or worse. We ask our loyal fans not to judge any of us over this exceptional incident.'
