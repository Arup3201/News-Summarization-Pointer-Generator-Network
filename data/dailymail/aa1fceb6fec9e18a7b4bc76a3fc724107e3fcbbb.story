A house believed to be the most expensive council home ever sold is up for auction and is expected to sell for £2.3million, it has emerged.

Southwark Council is selling the Grade II
listed building, which covers numbers 21 and 23 in Park Street, 
Borough, London, in a bid to cash in on its value.

Located within walking distance of Shakespeare's Globe theatre, a stone's throw from the City of London and in the shadow of the Shard, money brought in by the sale will be used to build more council housing nearby.

Under the hammer: This property in Park Street, Borough, is expected to become the 'most expensive council home ever sold' when it goes up for auction with a reserve of £2.3million on Monday

In need of work: It is thought that although the building, which is almost 200 years old, will need extensive refurbishment work, it could still earn the council far more than its reserve price

It is thought that although the building, which is almost 200 years old, will need extensive refurbishment work, it could still earn the council far more than its £2.3million reserve price.

As well as its excellent location, the building boasts an interesting history.

Adorned on one of the side walls is a large painted 'Take Courage' slogan which is thought to date back to the 19th century.

The building, built in 1820, was once owned by the brewer Courage and originally housed bosses from the nearby Anchor Brewery, which was demolished to make way for housing in the 1980s.

But the building eventually became council accommodation in 1986 with Southwark councillors deciding the property is too lucrative not to sell off when it recently became vacant.

Chris Coleman-Smith, head of auctions at Savills, the estate agent that is conducting the sale, told the Guardian: 'We think this will be the most expensive council home ever sold, and we are delighted that the proceeds of sale will contribute to creating more housing in the borough.'

The estate agent says that the property would be perfect for a developer to create two or more separate homes on the site.

According to property website Rightmove, the area has seen property prices soar 20 per cent over the past year with house prices across London up 8.7 per cent on the whole according to the Office for National Statistics.

According to the Guardian, property firm CBRE projects that over the next five years UK house prices could rise by around 17 per cent.

It says that prices in London could increase by as much as a third by the year 2018.
