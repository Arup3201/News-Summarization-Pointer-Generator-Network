An enormous and territorial elk has wandered into a Wyoming town and taken up residency in the streets as he prepares for the annual rut.

Bewildered employees can only watch from the windows in fear as the bull strolls proudly past their front steps.

People having been giving the giant elk a wide berth as he strutted past the Post Office and medical centre. They called police to keep the testosterone-pumped animal at bay.

Wrong way? Every year elk come through the town. The cows graze on the lush grass and the males are looking to mate

Every autumn, elk spend the afternoon and evenings walking the streets of Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

Occasionally, as many as 40 or 50 arrive together, attracting huge crowds who watch on with curiosity, awe and fear.

Wildlife photographer and writer Keith Crowley, 52, was there to capture the action last month.

He said the elk will stay in town for up to several weeks at a time as autumn marks the start of the mating season.

Don't mess with him: The elk are territorial and can be aggressive in autumn, so park wardens have to spend most of their time protecting tourists from injury

Mr Crowley, from Wisconsin, said: 'The cows come to graze on the lush grasses in town.

'The bulls, such as the one in these photos, follow since autumn is the heart of the annual breeding season, known as "the rut".

'The bulls sniff anything and everything they come across, looking for smells that tell them a cow is ready to be bred.'

The frustration and rising testosterone levels means the male elk are prone to damaging vehicles and property as well as injuring people.

Security threat: Police were called to monitor this magnificent bull, to ensure nobody got hurt

Bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them

According to Mr Crowley, some people will photograph them from their cars but this can be incredibly dangerous.

He said: 'They bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them.

'This is common though as Mammoth Hot Springs is the busiest town in Yellowstone National Park and is the headquarters for park operations.

'Because it is so busy with tourists and park employees, evenings in town during the elk rut are quite chaotic.

'Park rangers spend most of their time trying to prevent injury to the visitors and property.'
