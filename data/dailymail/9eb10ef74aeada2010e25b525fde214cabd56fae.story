Host commentator

Thanks for joining Sportsmail's coverage of this pre season friendly.

Keep an eye on the site for more of the same as Chelsea and the rest of the big clubs prepare for the big Premier League kick off next month.

'It was pretty physical because they've started the season already so we had to work even harder.

'Today I think I was good and I got a goal. I started near the half time and played a good one-two with Iva (Branislav Ivanovic) and it's a decent finish.'

'To play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but I've been working hard towards fitness.

'The shoulder is good - if we didn't know that I'm safe to play I wouldn't but we made the decision to go ahead.'

It ends 1-1 in Klagenfurt. Jeremie Boga superb equaliser cancels out Silvio de Oliviera's opener that may or not have crossed the line.

Three minutes of added time. Looks like this is going to end a draw.

89 mins: Pellets make two substitutes with a minute left...is this time wasting in a pre season friendly?!

Here's a Vine of Jeremie Boga's equaliser:

85 mins: Boga looks on fire. This time he hits a free kick which skims off the top of the small and out for a corner. He's only 17, you know.

83 mins: Wonderful play from Jeremie Boga - he goes on a great run through and even despite losing balance he finishes brilliantly into the bottom left hand corner.

80 mins: Another substitute from Mourinho, Nathaniel Chalobah replaces Nemanja Matic deep in midfield.

78 mins: Talk of the devil...Ivanovic has gone up front.

Also, a sub: Andreas Christensen comes on for Izzy Brown.

77 mins: Chelsea threw Branislav Ivanovic up front at the weekend and now it's John Terry's turn to make some advancing runs. The Chelea skipper wins a corner after finding his way into the penalty area, but the dead ball is wasted.

69 mins: Cech won't be giving up his No 1 shirt for Thibaut Courtois without a fight - here he makes a good reaction save and tips the ball over the bar from a close range header from de Oliviera to keep the score at 1-0.

67 mins: Chelsea have won a series of corners but they're still not creating a huge amount and Petr Cech has to beat away a strike from range as Pellets try to counter.

59 mins: Bamford, Luis and Van Ginkel come off for Dominic Solanke, Oriol Romeu and Nathan Ake

55 mins: A cross gets knocked back across the box and it comes to Silvio de Oliviera whose shot comes off Petr Cech and hits the bar. It's deemed to be over the line by the linesman after some protests and the Austrians lead.

49 mins: Kurt Zouma shows off his reckless side. He gave away a penalty against Wimbledon at the weekend and now he goes in for a big challenge on the right hand touchline but takes all of the man and none of the ball.

Off we go again in Klagenfurt as the referee gets us underway.

Jeremie Boga is coming on for Lewis Baker.

Good news: Marco van Ginkel has looked excellent in midfield for Chelsea - sharp passing, snappy challenges and generally looking very impressive. A quick screenshot of one of those big tackles is on show below...

Bad news: This game is fairly dire. Chelsea haven't created any clear cut chances and when they have had a sight of goal it's been wasted with Pellets 'keeper Alexander Kofner only having to make easy saves so far. Where are Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa when you need them?

Half time whistle goes in Klagenfurt and it's 0-0.

Jose Mourinho will no doubt ring the changes at the break.

34 mins: Patrick Bamford does really well to hold off a defender and puts Izzy Brown, but the 17-year-old can't convert and his shot hits the 'keeper.

27 mins: Salah goes down in the area looking for a penalty under Rene Seebacher's challenge but he went down easily and it's certainly not a spot kick. Easy decision for the referee.

'Crowd bored here already at the Worthersee Stadion. The Mexican waves have begun.'

22 mins: Best chance of the half. Izzy Brown's ball comes to Mo Salah on the edge of the box and he goes for it first time - doesn't connect well enough though. It's tame and well saved.

21 mins: Pellets try to launch a counter attack down their right hand side but Filipe Luis shows he'll be a solid option for Chelsea on the left by dealing with it well.

It's not the most exciting game so far - the crowd in Klagenfurt are already onto the Mexican waves...

15 mins: Patrick Bamford runs onto a ball from Nemanja Matic but he's too far wide really to shoot, but he gambles from a tight angle and hits the side netting.

12 min: Mo Salah dinks a ball over the top for Baker but it's slightly too long for him and he can't wrap his boot around it to knock it across the box.

11 mins: Marco van Ginkel is keen to impress... He's threw himself into a few big tackles so far.

No holding back which is perhaps surprisingly for someone who spent most of last season out with injury.

Mo Salah, by the way, has changed shirt number. He's switched from sporting the No 15 shirt to No 17.

That former, of course, was Didier Drogba's number when he first joined Chelsea. Is Salah leaving it open for the legendary centre forward's return?

8 mins: Good chance for Chelsea as Baker makes a run down the right flank and plays the ball to Patrick Bamford - he slips it through for Mo Salah but the Egyptian (now not off to join the military) gets tackled as he hesitates on the edge of the area.

6 mins: Bit of a slow start here with no real chances but Lewis Baker has the first shot on target with a free kick - well struck but easily saved by the goalkeeper. 

And we're off, Chelsea are in all blue tonight with white socks after sporting their yellow strip against Wycombe and Wimbledon.

Strong starting line-up from Chelsea there - even if Jose Mourinho is yet to trust his World Cup players with the chance to come back into the side. Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas all crashed out of the group stage and are all left out.

Filipe Luis does get a start though - he had the summer off after not being picked by Brazil, so it will be the first chance to see him in a Chelsea shirt. Hopefully we'll be seeing something like this: 

Chelsea subs: Mitchell Beeney, Matej Delac, Nathan Ake, Oriol Romeu, Nathaniel Chalobah, Andreas Christensen, John Swift, Jeremie Boga, Dominic Solanke.

Here's tonight's starting line up for Chelsea:

Starting XI: Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic, Kurt Zouma, John Terry, Felipe Luis, Marco Van Ginkel, Nemanja Matic, Mo Salah, Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown, Patrick Bamford.

So, Cech returns to the side after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in last season's Champions League semi final against Atletico Madrid.

Filipe Luis makes his debut on the left hand side while youngsters Baker, Bamford and Brown all get a chance to impress.

Expecting team news soon from Klagenfurt where Chelsea take on RZ Pellets.

The Blues opponents finished seventh in the Austrian top flight this season and have already started their new campaign. They won 4-1 at the weekend so it should be a decent test for Jose Mourinho's side tonight.

Returning 
from the World Cup, Chelsea are back in action with their new recruits 
in tow and you can follow their first game of their European pre season 
tour 
live with Sportsmail.

The Blues are in action in Klagenfurt, Austria to kick-off their preparations for the 
2014/15 season, and Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis could all make their debuts.

Jose
 Mourinho will continue to give some of his squad's youngsters a chance 
too - with Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and more joining the senior 
players on tour.
