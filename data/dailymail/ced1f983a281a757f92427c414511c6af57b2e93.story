Two disabled brothers have allegedly been refused membership to a bowling club because they made other players feel 'uncomfortable'.

Mark Kemp, 38, and his brother Dewi, 33, who both have Down's syndrome, went to a taster bowling session at a village club in Elloughton, East Yorks, but allegedly were soon told they were not welcome to join after a number of members threatened to leave.

The brothers had bought new bowling shoes and paid £5 to play at the Elloughton Short Mat Bowling Club, which had been arranged by their sister Emma Kemp. She had rang ahead to check the boys would be welcome.

But Mark and Dewi's carer was allegedly pulled to one side at the club on Monday and told the brothers' presence made other members feel uncomfortable.

Now Emma, 35, who lives with her brothers in North Cave, East Yorks, has been left furious at the decision.

Ms Kemp told the Hull Daily Mail: 'I am disgusted. This kind of discrimination is totally unacceptable.

'I think these individuals need re-educating.

'My brothers shouldn't have just been told to leave, without the members first getting to know them as people.

'People cannot prejudice because of their disability. 

'If the members didn't like them as people and chose not to play with them, that is different, but a decision like that can't just be made based on their disability.'  

The boys refer to doting sister Ms Kemp as mum after their mother died, and Ms Kemp tries to organise daily activities for her brothers to keep them stimulated and entertained.

She said: 'I couldn't find a disabled bowls group so I called this club and asked if they could come, with their carer, and I was told it wouldn't be a problem.

'They went and loved it and couldn't wait to go back, but the following week staff pulled their carer aside and said: "Sorry, but some members say having them here makes them feel uncomfortable".'

'They then offered to get a third mat out so the boys could play on their own, then said actually that wouldn't be possible because there wasn't enough space.

'The club is a social one, and not competitive or in a league, so their actual ability wasn't the issue.'

Ms Kemp complained about the brothers' treatment to the organisers, and a meeting was held with members to discuss the issue.

She said: 'I was fuming. Hearing they were having a meeting was like a red rag to a bull for me.'

And Ms Kemp hasn't been able to tell her brothers the truth about why they can't play, for fear of upsetting them.

She said: 'Obviously both boys are quite miffed about the situation but they don't understand the full extent of why they can't play.

'I had to be tactful. They knew there had been a problem and they couldn't bowl but I said there wasn't the room for them.

Ms Kemp said: 'I just wanted to arrange something nice for them. If they are left to sit around they get bored and pick up bad habits like rocking.

'The idea is that they can fully function in society with support and should be encouraged to do so.'

Ms Kemp first complained on Monday when the incident happened, but did not hear from the club until yesterday afternoon.

The club has now told Ms Kemp her brothers would be welcome to join, but she declined the offer and said she will be looking elsewhere for a new club for her brothers.

A spokesman from the Elloughton Short Mat Bowls Club, said: 'After taking advice from the East Riding Voluntary Action Services, I spoke to Miss Kemp on Wednesday afternoon, we came to an amicable agreement and I have no further comments to make.'

Ms Kemp has now consulted Equality Advisory Support Service for advice.
