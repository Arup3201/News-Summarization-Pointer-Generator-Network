The wife of the 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh called a local radio station to give her two cents on the topic of the day: What kind of wife would let her husband wear the same terrible outfit - a tucked-in black sweatshirt and pleated khakis belted high on the waist - every Sunday?

Sarah Harbaugh told 997Now's Fernando and Greg that she has spent years trying to talk her husband out of his signature Walmart khakis, even throwing them in the bin, to no avail.

'I've told him so many times: That outfit reflects on me!' she said.

Fernando and Greg were using Jim Harbaugh's sartorial setbacks as a launching pad for listeners to call in with their own significant other's clothing conundrums.

'Is this really Sarah Harbaugh?' asks one of the presenters.

'Yes it is. And not many things make me want to call in to a radio station,' she says laughing. 'But my friend called me this morning... I will NOT. I will not take the blame for his outfits.'

Mrs Harbaugh explains that she has tried to influence her husbands fashion choices, but 'he just doesn't care.'

'He's got a flattering body,' she adds, saying that she wants him in flat-front pants.

Bargain hunter: According to his wife, Jim Harbaugh spends just $8 per pair on the pleated-front khakis he is so fond of

Such is his attachment to the pleated pants that after she disposed of one pair, he stopped on his way to the NFL Scouting Combine to pick up a new pair.

'It's not just any store,' she told the radio jocks. 'You have to find them at a Walmart. Eight dollars. Eight dollars!' she laments.

She says she told her husband that he was aging himself and that he 'looks like Rain Man,' to the amusement of Greg and Fernando.

Stopping just short of calling her husband superstitious, she says that at this point in the season she knows he can't change his outfit.

But Mrs Harbaugh said she'd spoken to her husband and asked him if after the final he would let her - or someone else - dress him, and he had agreed.

According to SF Gate, Harbaugh is aware of the morning radio discussion.

'I heard they were making quite a bit of sport of me,' he said. 'Happy wife, happy life.'

He reportedly stocked up on some new pants Wednesday, but isn't quite ready to trade in his tucked-in sweatshirt.

'If I'm the last person who tucks in his shirt, that will be great,' he said. 'I'll feel like an innovator.'

He was snapped by a fan in Walmart - where else - buying several pairs of flat-front Dickies, for which he paid '$23 a pair, on sale.'
