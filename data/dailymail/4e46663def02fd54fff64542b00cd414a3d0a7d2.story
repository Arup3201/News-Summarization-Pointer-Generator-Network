A suicidal Disneyland Paris worker poured petrol over himself and had to be restrained from setting himself alight by a colleague after he was summoned to a meeting with the theme park bosses.

The grim revelation adds to mounting speculation about working conditions at the most visited tourist site in Europe which had already seen two employee suicides in the past few years.

'He emptied a barrel of petrol over his head and took a lighter to set fire...but a  colleague jumped on him at the last moment, preventing him from committing the irreparable,' said Patrick Maldidier, a representative of the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions.

In a letter to theme park officials, Unsa warned of a 'deterioration of the social climate which is noticed by 
us as well as the employees within the company,' reported The Independent.

It added: 'We believe that this 
deterioration is related to changes in working conditions. This 
deterioration of the social climate is also accentuated by an absence of
 dialogue and a sharp increase in disciplinary sanctions.'

The union said it has opened its own 
investigation 'to understand the reasons' for the suicide attempt, and 
said they are planning to file a complaint against Disneyland Paris.

A spokesman for Disney said: 'Several investigations are being conducted by independent experts to understand  this incident. The employee, has received counselling and is now back at work but to respect his privacy, no further details can be shared.'

A spokesman for Disneyland Paris said the park was saddened' by the actions of the employee, which took place on 18 October this year.

The man whose identity has not been revealed, is being closely monitored.

But Unsa has opened its own investigation and says they are planning to file a complaint against Disneyland Paris.

The French offering is not wholly-owned by the Walt Disney Company, unlike the US ventures.

Disney has a 39.8 per cent stake in it with 50.2 per cent floated on the stock exchange in Paris.

Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed owns 10 per cent - he saved Disneyland Paris from bankruptcy by injecting $350m into its parent company Euro Disney in 1994.

The company said: 'Disneyland Paris has maintained its employment levels since 2009 while many employers have significantly reduced their workforces due to the difficult economic climate; additionally the Company has delivered four salary plans in four years, with an average increase of 10 per cent between 2008 and 2012.'

In 2010 two chefs who worked at the park took their own lives.

The first man threw himself under a train -
 his death came a day after another worker threatened to kill himself at
 the attraction after it was announced he was to be dismissed.

The second was a man who was due to start back at work after a prolonged period of sick leave, but a trade union representing him said he described the working conditions at the popular theme park as 'humiliating'.

A Disney staff and management health committee investigation found no evidence of work harassment after the first suicide, and Disneyland Paris directors denied that the second suicide was work-related.

Earlier this month it was revealed that Disneyland Paris attracted a million fewer visitors this year after a record 2012.

Visitorship fell to 14.9 million for the financial year ending September, compared to 16 million in 2012, the theme park's operator Euro Disney said.

Bad press: Last moth Iban, a five-year-old boy from Montpellier, in the south of France, was left ¿fighting for his life¿ after falling off the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction

The slump was mostly due to a drop in French visitors -- who fell by 600,000.

The theme park also recorded fewer Spanish and Italian visitors, although more British and Germans turned up.

Overall sales slipped 1.1 percent to 1.31 billion euros ($1.75 billion) for the year.

The revelation is the latest bit of bad news for Disneyland Paris - it has been the scene of a number of accidents in recent years.

Last moth Iban, a five-year-old boy from Montpellier, in the south of France, was left ‘fighting for his life’ after falling off the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.

It led to Julien Kaufman, vice president of the EuroDisney group which runs the amusement park, saying everything would be done to ‘work out what happened.’

Disneyland Paris attracted 16 million visitors last year — twice the number who went up the Eiffel Tower - but it has failed to make profits since it opened 20 years ago.

Britons are the biggest foreign visitor group to Paris, and thousands of them head to Disneyland every week.

Construction started on the 5,000-acre site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992, well over budget.

Visitor numbers were lower than hoped for and the hotels fell below their targets.

Two years after it opened, headlines asked if it was heading for bankruptcy. But in 1994, banks agreed to restructure the project's debts. By the end of 1994, the park had turned a corner.

New rides such as Space Mountain were opened in 1995 and a second park - the Walt Disney Studios Park - opened to mark its 10th birthday. Now it has celebrated its 20th anniversary.

However, it was revealed in April 2012 that the park owed a staggering £1.6billion - and it would take at least 12 years to pay off the debt.

In September a 5,000-strong petition was launched against the park, claiming it was 'falling apart', amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows. Disney did not comment.
