Arsene Wenger has taken the unusual step of naming his Arsenal side to face Galatasaray over 24 hours before the match kicks off, with three reserve forwards included in the starting XI.

Yaya Sanogo, Lukas Podolski and Joel Campbell have been tasked with leading the line for Wenger's side, despite the fact that first place in the group is still up for grabs.

The Gunners have already ensured qualification to the knockout stages, but can still take top spot in Group D if they beat Galatasaray and Borussia Dortmund lose to Anderlecht.

A number of first-team forwards have been left out of the Arsenal squad, including Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. 

Wenger made the bold move of naming his XI the day before the game, despite it giving the opposition more time to analyse his players.

The Arsenal squad to face Galatasaray in Turkey also features a return to action for Mathieu Debuchy, who has been out injured since September 13th.

Arsenal's team to face Galatasaray (4-3-3): Szczesny; Debuchy, Mertesacker, Chambers, Bellerin; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Flamini, Ramsey; Campbell, Sanogo, Podolski.

Subs: Martinez, Akpom, Zelalem, Kamara, O'Connor, Iwobi, Maitland-Niles.

Arsenal guaranteed their place in the round of 16 with a win against group leaders Borussia Dortmund last time out.

They will finish second in Group D unless they beat Galatasaray and Dortmund lose to Anderlecht (or, more unlikely, the German side draw — and Arsenal win by seven).

With Newcastle next in the Premier League, the Frenchman's return has added importance as he prepares to face his former club for the first time.  

Wenger's bench, which he also named during Monday's press conference, features a number of youth players who are yet to make a first-team appearance.

Chuba Akpom, Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stefan O'Connor, Alex Iwobi and Glen Kamara all have a chance to feature on Tuesday night, in a game that could yet prove decisive in Arsenal's season.
