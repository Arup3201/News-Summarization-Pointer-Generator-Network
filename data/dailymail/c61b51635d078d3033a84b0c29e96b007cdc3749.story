The guide is the first published by Cosmopolitan since it became a women's magazine in the 1960s

Known as the high-street sex bible, women’s magazine Cosmopolitan has once again pushed boundaries when it comes to bedroom advice.

The magazine has published its very first sex guide for lesbian couples in its 50 year history.

In keeping with other erotic material published by the magazine, the piece entitled ’28 mind-blowing lesbian sex positions’ has graphic descriptions for each one.

Containing step-by-step information on exotic sounding positions such as the ‘kinky jockey’, the ‘tawdry tire-swing’, the ‘erotic maypole’ and the ‘sexy spider’, the guide also has accompanying explicit drawings for each.

Requiring a variety of props, including sex toys, handcuffs, chairs the guide includes role playing (think, good cop bad cop type scenarios) as well as mild S&M.

While not for the prudish or faint-of-heart, the guide marks an increasing inclusion of homosexual relationships in mainstream media.

Cosmopolitan.com has over 1.6 million readers worldwide, making it the largest young women’s magazine worldwide.

Originally started as a family magazine in America in 1886, it only took its current form as a women’s magazine in the 1960s, becoming increasingly more sexual in content.

Now a champion of sexual liberation for women, with the idea that women should enjoy sex without any guilt placed on them by societal prejudices, the magazine runs articles on numerous ways women can maximise their pleasure in bed as well as please their man.

Former editor of The Erotic Review and Daily Mail sex columnist Rowan Pelling says: 'There's no greater mirror of contemporary sexual mores than Cosmopolitan. When erotic fashions evolve, Cosmo reflects those changes, so there's no doubt the mag's publication of a lesbian sex guide is significant.

'It demonstrates far greater acceptance of same sex relationships and of experimentation by women who feel their sexuality is fluid. And it must come as a huge relief to all the Cosmo writers who have exhausted every single thing you can possibly say about blow-jobs and the reverse cowboy.'

Good cop, naughty cop: This position is essentially the same as 'doggy style', but involving either the use of a strap-on sex toy, or manual stimulation while the lower partner has their hands handcuffed behind their back.

The passionate pole dancer: One partner sits on a chair, with the other partner supported in their lap, facing away from them. Raising a knee helps keep things stable as well as providing stimulation for their clitoris.

The Kinky Jockey: One partner kneels on all four and the other sits on them, using their tailbone as clitoral stimulation while yanking their hair like reins.

Defying gravity: One partner sits normal in a chair while the other kneels on her, facing out, and drops down to the floor, using their hands to balance. This provides an ideal position for oral sex.
