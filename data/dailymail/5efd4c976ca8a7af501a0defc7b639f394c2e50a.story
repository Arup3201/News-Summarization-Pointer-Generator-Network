Lies: Janine Wiles, 24 from Blackpool, Lancashire, has been jailed for six months, at Preston Crown Court, for falsely reporting her daughter had been abducted from her backyard

A pregnant mother-of-four has been 
jailed for six months for falsely claiming her two-year-old daughter had
been snatched from her back yard.

Janine Wiles told police the girl was seized while she was playing on a trampoline.

She claimed she saw a masked man walking off with her daughter, ran after him and managed to seize the child out of his arms.

Police launched a 13-day hunt involving 50 officers and costing more than £50,000, which culminated in the arrest of two men.

Wiles, 24, even took part in an 
identity parade – where she made a false identification – before she 
eventually admitted she had been lying.

Yesterday she was beginning a six 
month sentence after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice
at Preston Crown Court.

The court heard unemployed Wiles 
called police in June last year to say an intruder had scaled the wall 
of her back yard and attempted to snatch her daughter.

Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said: 
‘She described a confrontation with the man, grabs the child from him 
and the man walks away from the scene.’

Police were called to the house in 
Blackpool and began screening CCTV footage.

Case: Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that she had made up that her two-year-old was snatched by a man who tried to escape on a bike

Wiles' deception is similar to the one carried out by Karen Matthews, above, in 2008.

Matthews,
36, was nicknamed ‘Britain’s worst mother’ after she hatched a plot to 
abduct her daughter Shannon, below right, then aged nine, in February 2008 in an elaborate attempt
to claim a £50,000 reward.

She was released from prison this month after serving just half of an eight-year sentence for kidnapping her daughter.

The
mother of seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire and 
taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former 
home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire.

Matthews and her accomplice, Michael Donovan, 44, sparked a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home.

A
tearful Matthews made TV appeals pleading with her daughter’s abductor 
to set her free and hundreds of local people helped search for the girl.

Shannon
was found by police 24 days later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden
in a compartment under a bed. Donovan, who was also jailed for eight 
years, was released last week.

Wiles went on to give a 
detailed description of the man and an ‘emotive account’ of her child 
screaming ‘mummy, mummy’, with another child – who was playing in the 
backyard – shouting out: ‘Janine, he’s got her.’

Mr McEntee said police wasted hours 
reviewing CCTV footage and spent £4,847 on collecting forensic evidence 
and more than £45,000 on manpower during the ‘wild goose chase’.

‘There were repeated concerns from 
those living in the neighbourhood, who were all in fear this offender 
may strike again,’ he added.

‘And the police were not in a position to allay these fears as they were chasing a phantom offender.’

Virginia Hayton, defending, said Wiles
– who is pregnant with her fifth child – was depressed after breaking 
up with her partner.

She said the cry for help had 
ironically provided the support she needed, as her boyfriend moved back 
in. Miss Hayton said: ‘This was not premeditated. She found herself 
getting swept away.’

Sentencing Wiles to six months in 
prison, Judge Pamela Badley said: ‘The effect of your actions, first of 
all, was public disquiet in a community.

'One of the most dreadful things is 
the fear of the lack of safety of a child.

'That causes concern to every 
parent, every school, every responsible adult.’

Judge Badley sympathised with Wiles’ 
tough life but added it was her public duty to jail Wiles, who wept 
uncontrollably at the sentence.

The defendant was told it was ‘highly likely’ she would be free when due to give birth in September.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrea 
Barrow said: ‘This had a massive impact on residents who were obviously 
concerned there was a man who had tried to abduct a child when in fact 
this simply was not true.

‘Parents changed their activities because of their concerns for their own children.’
