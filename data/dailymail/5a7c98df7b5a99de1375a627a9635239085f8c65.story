 A zombie cat who 'rose from the dead' and could now be worth a fortune will not be returned to its owner after 'new information' emerged about his burial. 

Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, was run over and then buried - but then returned to the home of his shocked owner Ellis Hutson in Florida.

He was taken to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service where he had his eye removed and jaw repaired. 

He is expected to recovery fully and was scheduled to return home to Hutson in the coming weeks - until the center announced this weekend it was not happy to return him.

'Recently we have learned new information about Bart's home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial,' the center's statement read.  

'Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. 

'We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat.' 

The news of his amazing survival made headlines across the world - and Bart may soon be as famous - and financially rewarding - as Grumpy Cat.

Ellias Hutson previously told ABC News he was devastated when he had to bury the animal.

He said he was shocked after Bart showed up back at home five days after an apparently fatal accident.

Unable to afford to fees for Bart's operation, Hutson had then reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. 

Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal.

Hutson had found his pet in a pool of blood in the street, not moving, after a collision earlier this month.

Whence he rose: Bart was buried in this shallow hole not far from his home

Vets were baffled by Bart's mysterious survival - but Hutson believes his revival may be the doing of his brother and playmate.

Speaking to local news station Fox13 about the strange happening, he suggested that Bart's friend may have gone looking for him and clawed him out of his resting place.

He said: 'We have two cats and they play together all the time and they roam around with each other.

'He might have went looking for his brother and dug him up - but I have no idea'.

Life after death: Bart has been given surgery to repair his broken jaw, and is seen above recovering

The mystery deepened when Hutson revealed that he was so upset by his pet's apparent demise that he did not bury Bart himself - but asked his friend David Liss to do the deed.

Liss said he had no idea how Bart could have been alive. 

He told Fox13: 'I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I didn't see the chest moving up and down or anything and I said, 'you know, well look at the blood, it's dead.''

Experts believe Bart rose from the grave not long after being buried there - but was scared so stayed away from home for several days.
