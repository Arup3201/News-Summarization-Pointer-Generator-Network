Crash victim: Laura Farrell, 41, was killed in the car crash in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last year

An angry woman driver who killed a bank worker in a car crash while driving in a 'fast and furious' manner following a screaming row with her boyfriend today faced up to 14 years in prison.

Sheri Torkington, 32, denied causing the death of Laura Farrell by dangerous driving but was yesterday found guilty by a jury.

Bolton Crown Court heard Torkington was so angry she jumped a red light and hit Mrs Farrell's car who was driving her husband to work in the early hours of the morning.

Mrs Farrell, 41, a HSBC bank worker, suffered fatal injuries in the accident in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and died at the scene.

Her husband Norman, 52, was left with a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung.

A witness told the court how she awoke at 3am to see Torkington having a row with boyfriend Phillip 
Holt.

The couple were said to have been 'shouting screaming and yelling'
at each other in a row over her ex-lover.

Torkington then got into 
her Ford Fiesta and was seen to angrily revv up her car engine before 
wheel spinning away.

She careered through residential streets
in Bolton, Greater Manchester before ploughing into Mrs Farrell’s Ford 
Focus at up to 45mph.

Torkington - who has since married Mr Holt - showed no emotion as she was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving following only 30 minutes deliberation by the jury.

She denied the charge insisting she had only had a 'minor disagreement' with Mr Holt in the run up the crash. She said the traffic lights were on amber when she went through them.

After the verdict Mrs Farrell’s brother Fraser Robbins, 42, a baker, said: 'We feel relieved this case is over.

'It’s been nearly two years that 
we’ve been waiting for some closure. The guilty verdict has gone some 
way to help us but whatever the sentence will be it’s not going to bring
Laura back. We were very close, she was my big sister by 10 months and 
it was just the two of us.

'She was quite quiet and reserved but
she always had a big smile on her face when we saw her. She was devoted
to Norman and would go to bed at 7pm if she was driving him to work at 
3am. She’d then go and do a full day’s work herself. It’s been a 
difficult time for Norman and all the family.

'Remaining calm throughout this trial was difficult, but we are a reserved family and we did it for Laura.'

The tragedy on June 29, 2011, began 
when witness Joan Haslam, who lives in Tonge Moor Road, Bolton, woke up 
and looked out of her window to see Mr Holt, who she knew from the local
cricket club, arguing with Torkington outside for ten minutes.

Mr Darren Preston prosecuting said: 
'She heard shouting and screaming coming from outside. She looked out 
her window and there she saw a male and a female.

'We say that the female was the 
defendant. Mrs Haslam saw her get into the car after Holt walked off and
she drove off at speed. The defendant was angry and aggressive because 
of the argument and she drove aggressively and recklessly as a result.'

Mrs Farrell had been taking her husband to work at a cheese distribution factory where he worked night shifts in her black Ford Focus.

Crash scene: The junction on Turton Street, Bolton with the A666 St Peters Way, where the accident happened

A cyclist saw Mrs Farrell’s 
proceeding through a green light - only for Torkington’s car to jump a 
red light in to the path of the black Ford Focus. Torkington's car 
pushed Mrs Farrell’s vehicle into the crash barrier and then spun into 
the middle of the dual carriage way at 3.25am.

Mr Farrell, who had been in a 
relationship with Laura for 23 years, but were only married for seven 
added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, coasting up to the lights which 
were on red - we must have been travelling at 10mph.

'The lights started to change as we 
were about 10 to15 metres away from the lights. I looked to the right 
and by the time I looked left all I could see was grey and a crunching 
noise and that’s all I remember.'

Mr Farrell woke up in Bolton Royal 
Hospital to be told his wife had died in the crash. He sustained a 
broken pelvis, neck and collarbone and a collapsed lung and spent two 
months in hospital. He now has abscesses on his brain, liver and lung.

A victim impact statement revealed he
had had trouble sleeping and has been fed through a tube and a syringe 
because of on-going problems with his stomach.

Torkington, of Nuffield Close, 
Halliwell, Bolton, who only started driving in September 2010, later 
denied being angry after her bust up with her partner and denied 
speeding through the red light.

She said she had watched Mr Holt play
pool at a pub, before heading to another bar. They returned home around
10.30pm and had a 'minor disagreement' after which she drove him to his
daughter’s house.

She left her then 14-year-old son to look after her other children.

Giving evidence, Torkington said: 'It
was a minor disagreement. I vaguely remember the disagreement being 
about my ex. To me an argument is screaming and shouting at each other.'

She added: 'I have a plate in my left
leg, plate in my left arm. I had three broken metatarsals, a torn 
spleen, a fractured pelvis. I was cut from front to back. I hit my head 
severely. I was in hospital for three weeks.'

Torkington was remanded on bail so 
could find suitable care arrangements for her four children. She will be
sentenced next week and faces up to 14 years in prison. She was given 
interim driving ban and was banned from entering pubs and clubs. She was
placed on a 7pm to 7am curfew.
