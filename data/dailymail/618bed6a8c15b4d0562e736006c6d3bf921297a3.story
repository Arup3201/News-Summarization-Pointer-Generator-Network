The murderer of a mother-of-five stabbed to death while tending to her horses may have followed her for miles to the paddock where she was found, police said today.

Penelope ‘Pennie’ 
Davis, 47, was discovered by her husband Pete 
in a field last Tuesday in the New Forest near Beaulieu.

Today police revealed they were looking for anyone seen acting suspiciously around the Sainsbury's branch where she worked in Blackfield, Hampshire, between 1pm and 3pm on the day she died.

Death: Penelope Davis was found stabbed multiple times in a field near Beaulieu, Hampshire, last Tuesday

Investigation: The mother-of-five was tending to two of her horses when she was stabbed to death in daylight

Probing the incident: Specialist forensics police officers have carried out fingertip searches of the field 

Detectives tonight arrested a man on suspicion of murder.

The 36-year-old man was arrested in Southampton at 7.50pm and remains in police custody.

A 22-year-old man
 arrested on suspicion of murder and a 37-year-old man arrested on 
suspicion of assisting an offender have both been released on police 
bail pending further inquiries.

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, 
said: 'It’s been a week since Pennie was murdered and in that time we’ve
 made significant progress with more than 200 officers and staff working
 on the investigation.

'Since the start of the appeal we’ve received more than 230 messages from the public.

'Pennie had recently started renting out the field but not many people were aware of that.

'One
 of our lines of inquiry therefore is the possibility she was followed 
from Blackfield Sainsbury’s, where she’d been working that morning, to 
the paddock by Leygreen Farm.'

The farm was near the village of Beauleiu, which is four miles from the branch of Sainsbury's where the mother-of-five worked.

Today
 Mrs Davis' family spoke of how they will never know ‘how scared and how
 alone she must have felt' as a £5,000 reward was issued for finding her
 killer.

Mr Davis and the 
couple’s children, Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georgia, 18, Daniel, 14, and 
Josef, 13, said the last week since the supermarket worker died of stab 
wounds had been ‘long’ and ‘agonising’.

Tributes: Family and friends left cards and flowers near the spot where the supermarket worker was killed

Tough time: Mrs Davis's husband, Pete (blue shirt), was emotional as he left a bouquet of flowers by the field

The family said in a statement: ‘We 
had no idea how many lives she had touched, as we have been overwhelmed 
by love and support. Despite this, the void in our hearts only continues
 to grow.

The police have 
made progress, but there is still much more to be done. We only hope 
that no other family should ever have to go through the ordeal that we 
are currently facing.

‘No 
other person deserves to ever have to go the way our poor mum and wife 
did. We will never begin to understand how scared and how alone she must
 have felt.

‘This is why we 
are pleading for anybody with any information to come forward. Even if 
you think it won’t make a difference, it might just be the call we were 
waiting for.’

Following her 
death, Mr Davis, their children and Mrs Davis’s parents visited the 
paddock, leaving flowers with messages from each member of the family.

Sadness: The victim's parents and her children have also visited the paddock to leave tributes to Mrs Davis

Location: Mrs Davis was found by her husband in a field just yards from Leygreen Farm, in the New Forest

Taking care: Police have also increased patrols in the area to offer reassurance to residents

Searching: Police were seen wading through a river next to the field in Hampshire as they looked for a weapon

Her
 daughter Georgia left a note saying: 'Dearest mum, you were a goddess. I
 swear I'll make you proud. I like to think you're sitting there, 
watching on a cloud. You had so much more to give.

‘You
 had so much more to do. But now I'll be your legacy. I'll do it all for
 you. You climbed the highest mountains, you walked the longest plains, 
you'll never be forgotten. Forever in our hearts. I love you to the moon
 and back.'

'No other person deserves to ever have to go the way our poor mum and wife did. We will never begin to understand how scared and how alone she must have felt'

Family of Penelope Davis

Crimestoppers offered a
 £5,000 reward today for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
the people, or person, responsible for Mrs Davis’s brutal murder.

Julia
 Hughes, Regional Manager for Crimestoppers, said: 'We urgently need to 
find whoever it is that committed this horrendous crime.

'Pennie’s family is totally bereft and need answers. We
 would urge anyone with information to contact us anonymously, safe in 
the knowledge that their identity will not be revealed.'

Forensic officers have carried out fingertip searches of the 
field and police have increased local patrols to offer reassurance to 
residents.
