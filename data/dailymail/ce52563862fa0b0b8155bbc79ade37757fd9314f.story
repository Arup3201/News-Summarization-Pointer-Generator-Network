Most of us have been a guest at a church wedding, garden wedding or even a wedding on a boat, but what about a wedding at a supermarket?

Six months ago Jennifer Chou proposed to her fiancé Christian Kasper via text message to which he replied 'yes, but only if you let me plan the wedding,'.  And boy did he plan a wedding she would never forget!

Mr Kasper perfectly orchestrated a surprise flash mob at Countdown supermarket in Dunedin, the second largest city in the South Island of New Zealand.

A video uploaded onto YouTube shows the groom anxiously wait for his unsuspecting bride to enter the grocery store which is filled with food shoppers, friends and family on September 13 at 4pm.

After flash dancers surrounded Ms Chou, her fiance dropped to one knee and asked her to marry him right then and there

'Any minute now -my pulse is normal, 290 - awesome, let's do this common,' he said to the camera bouncing up and down full on nerves.

Ms Chou, dressed in casual clothes, walks into Countdown and is greeted by a man with a cheese taste-tester plate; once she picks up a piece of cheese the man suddenly turns around and blows a whistle to kick off the romantic surprise.

Flash dancers break out from the aisle making their way through dance towards Ms Chou who looks shocked and scared as she  slowly moves into a aisle.

Suddenly the dancers drop to one knee surrounding Ms Chou as her man  pushes through the flash crowd to greet his fiancée with an embrace

'I love you, I love you,' he said.  

'You know how you proposed to me six months ago and it was very romantically via text message and I said yes if you let me organise the wedding?' Mr Kasper gets down on one knee as he continues. 'So today, will you marry me?' 

 

The overwhelmed bride-to-be embraced her man and responded with a yes! 

The crowd let out a roar and broke out into another flash dance to kick off the wedding celebrations
