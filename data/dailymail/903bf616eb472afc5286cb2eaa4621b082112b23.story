Iran could launch a Lockerbie-style terrorist strike if it is hit with an international oil embargo, an academic warned last night.

Professor Paul Stevens, a senior research fellow at think-tank Chatham House, said it was ‘extremely unlikely’ Tehran would not retaliate against crippling sanctions.

However, he said he doubted it would carry out its threat to blockade the Straits of Hormuz, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, for fear of creating a ‘shooting war’ with the U.S.

Instead, Professor Stevens claimed 
that blocking oil exports to America and the EU would encourage 
hardliners inside the Islamic state to retaliate, adding: ‘There could 
even be a Lockerbie-type response from within Iran.’

The UK could face losing up to a half of its gas imports if Iran does carry through its threat to close a vital shipping route.

Iran
 has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against 
international sanctions imposed because of its nuclear development 
programme.

Closing the 
Strait would block a trade route through which 46 per cent of Britain's 
gas imports pass en route from Qatar, while 84 per cent of the UK's 
Liquefied Natural Gas imports use the same route.

According to the Department of Energy and Climate change, the imports through the strait represent 15 per cent of Britain's total gas supply.

The increasing stand-off in the Gulf has caused several spikes in oil prices in recent weeks and a former military chief has warned that Britain would have to weather the economic fall-out should the closure occur.

'I have no doubt at all that this would be the biggest problem for us,' Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy and security adviser to Gordon Brown, told the Financial Times.

Britain has increasingly relied on gas imports from Qatar since 2010 - increasing the supply by 67 per cent - with supply from Norway dropping 17 per cent and North Sea supplies shrinking.

From August to October last year, the most recent period for which the DECC has data, all the UK’s LNG imports – or 46 per cent of its total gas demand – came from Qatar.

In February 2011 Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, signed a three-year deal with Qatar for LNG supply over the next three years. There were also hints that a 10-year deal could be agreed.

Not just gas: Oil ships such as these provide constant traffic through the Strait as it carries one-fifth of the world's oil

Britain's gas supply is at risk because it buys from such a narrow pool of suppliers and there is no viable export alternative for Qatar than the Strait, which carries a fifth of the world’s oil and one-third of its LNG.

A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: 'We are aware of the importance of Hormuz, both in terms of oil and liquefied natural gas imports to the UK.

'We are therefore working across Whitehall on this issue. Relevant ministers have been briefed.

'We have a variety of potential gas suppliers and energy sources should we need to draw upon them, including pipelines to mainland Europe and Norway, and our own North Sea.

'The UK has access to a wide variety of gas sources and routes, including production from the UK Continental Shelf, imports from Norway and from the Continent, LNG from global markets and gas storage.

Added complication: The energy crisis is not helped by March elections in, meaning Mahmoud Ahmadinejad needs to appear tough

'In addition, at times of market 
tightness, mechanisms on the demand-side such as switching to coal in 
the power sector can be used to ensure demand and supply balance.'

Britain's gas supply has shifted 
increasingly towards LPG. It now accounts for around a fifth of UK 
supply and that reliance is expected to grow.

By 2015 the UK is forecast to import about two-thirds of its gas, rising to about 80 per cent in 2020.

Though a potential closure would have a very heavy impact on Britain's gas supplies it would have less of an impact on the UK's oil supply, with less than one per cent arriving by that route.

A 2008 report by Lehman Brothers listed the Strait as the world's top 'choke point' for oil supply.

There has been strong momentum for energy sanctions since the publishing of a U.N. watchdog report saying Iran appeared to have worked on designing an atom bomb.    

Western countries suspect Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons capability. Iran says it is only interested in nuclear technology for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday he was 'confident' the 27-member European Union would impose resounding sanctions on Iran's oil industry and possibly other sectors at an EU foreign ministers meeting on January 23.     

Mr Hague said: 'Our sanctions are part of trying to get Iran to change course and to enter negotiations and we should not be deterred from implementing those. We will continue to intensify our own sanctions and those of the European Union.'

The issue is also being clouded by Iran's upcoming presidential elections in March, which means the government in Tehran needs to be seen as acting strongly on these critical issues.

Iran probably won't blockade Straits of Hormuz, though, says expert
