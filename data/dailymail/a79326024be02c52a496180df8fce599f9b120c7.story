A woman who thought she was having a stroke had to get out of the ambulance and take the subway to a D.C. hospital because the driver and paramedic were arguing so aggressively.

'They were constantly bickering back and forth with one another, and to the point that I felt so uncomfortable,' Rose Preston said of the emergency response team she was matched with on Saturday.

Ms Preston, a veteran, called 911 because she 'started having numbness on the left side of my face and this tingling'.

Frustrating: Rose Preston called 911 because she thought she was having a stroke but because the paramedics were bickering, she did not feel safe in the ambulance and got out

Symptoms: She felt a tingling on her right side and thought she was having a stroke but it was later Bell's Palsy, a disease that causes paralysis on one side

She thought that she was having a stroke but it was later determined that she had Bell's Palsy, a form a facial paralysis that requires immediate care.

Her care was delayed, however, because she felt forced into getting out of the ambulance in order to make her way safely to the hospital.

'I didn't feel safe being transported by the vehicle,' she told NBC Washington.

'It really complicated my condition by not being able to receive adequate medical attention when I called.'

Ms Preston lives in the Southeast 
quarter of D.C. and her 911 call was dealt with by a paramedic from the 
Northeast and an ambulance from the Southeast area.

The
 individual emergency responders have not been publicly identified, but 
Ms Preston said that she got the impression that the fight between the 
responders in the ambulance was personal in nature.

'Unprofessional': Ms Preston said that she felt unsafe in the ambulance and feared that she would not make it to the hospital so she got out and took the metro there later that day

'A total lack of professionalism in every way you can imagine,' she told NBC Washington.

Ms Preston took the metro to a veteran's hospital later that day, and received treatment for the Bell's Palsy after she arrived.

The condition is one where treatment time plays a role in how the condition proceeds, meaning that her outcome could have been effected by the delay in her arrival at the hospital.

She has not provided any further detail about what caused the affliction.
