High life: Owen Danter, a former bank manager at Santander, stole more than £100,000 from his customers to fund his luxury cars and clothes

A bank manager abused his position of authority to steal £128,000 from elderly women customers to fund his champagne lifestyle, a court heard yesterday.

Owen Danter, 33, targeted pensioners who ‘always asked for him personally’ because they trusted him and he knew they rarely checked their savings accounts.

Despite siphoning off tens of thousands of pounds over four years, the Santander Bank branch manager was never suspected and his thefts were not picked up by quarterly audits.

Danter, a former deputy chairman of the local Conservative Association and leading light in the Chamber of Trade, was a respected figure who would be seen around town dressed in sharp suits and driving luxury sports cars.

He was manager in the East Yorkshire market town of Driffield, but his salary of £35,000 plus bonuses was insufficient to fund the lifestyle he wanted to lead, Hull Crown Court heard.

Starting with small amounts and increasing the thefts to thousands, he emptied the accounts of his most vulnerable customers and spent every penny on drinking, entertaining and socialising.

Detective Sergeant John Meagher said: ‘He was living the high life and spending the money on expensive drinks such as champagne.’

He was caught when he carried out a failed suicide attempt. He left a note for his employers, detailing his criminal behaviour and naming the accounts he had stolen from.

Danter, of Beverley, East Yorkshire, admitted nine offences of theft and was yesterday jailed for 21 months.

Judge Jeremy Baker QC told him his victims were ‘emotionally upset’ when the crimes came to light and ‘they realised the person they trusted, their bank manager, had in fact defrauded them’.

The court heard Danter had become an  alcoholic and his condition fuelled the thefts.

The judge told him: ‘You set up a front to your life of respectability, but underneath it all was the fact you became addicted to alcohol.’

Jane Bryan, prosecuting, said Danter picked on elderly customers with bonds and savings accounts where ‘the missing money was unlikely to be noticed’.

One victim, aged 69, had £70,969 stolen from three accounts. Another, aged 82, had signed over power of attorney to her daughter but Danter still managed to take £10,000.

A third was actually dead when he stole £8,400 and closed her account.

His eldest victim was an 86-year-old woman who had £17,599 taken from her accounts. The offences took place between June 2007 and July 2011, when he stole £15,000 from the bank cash machine and disappeared.

Danter drove to a forest to commit suicide, but the attempt failed and he raised the alarm and was taken to hospital.

Police, alerted by colleagues and relatives worried about his disappearance, found suicide notes detailing his crimes.

After being released from hospital Danter gave a full confession. Bernard Gateshill, defending, disputed the prosecution figures and said the thefts totalled £107,000.

All money stolen from customers has been reimbursed by the bank and Santander has recovered £30,000 from Danter’s pension fund.
