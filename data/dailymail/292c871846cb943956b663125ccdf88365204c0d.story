A Boston bombing victim who suffered serious burns to his arms and legs has proposed to a nurse he met during his recovery.

James Costello, 31, from Malden, Massachusetts, popped the question to Krista D'Agostino while on a 10-day trip to Europe for bombing survivors - and she said yes.

The heartwarming news comes eight months after Costello headed to the marathon finish line with five childhood friends. The bombs exploded nearby, killing three and injuring more than 270.

Costello was famously pictured looking dazed walking through the debris-strewn streets with his clothes torn to shreds by the blasts.

His right arm and right leg suffered such serious burns that he needed pig skin grafts.

'April 15 was one of the worst days of
 my life,' Costello, known as 'Bim' to his friends, wrote in a Facebook post. 'I soon
 wondered why and for what reason this had happened.'

But from the pain he found joy. After undergoing multiple surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital, he was moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - where he first saw Krista D'Agostino.

'A few days later I saw a nurse in 
passing, this would turn out to be Krista, who had shared a few mutual 
friends, but we had never crossed paths before,' he wrote.

'After 
sharing a handful of conversations I realized not only how beautiful she
 was but also what a kind heart she had. I somehow convinced her to 
attend a benefit with me, which turned into a few dates, which turned 
into a few inseparable months.'

The couple are now abroad in Europe with other victims and first responders who are enjoying a 'Heroes Cruise'. While in Lyon, France, Costello proposed to D'Agostino.

'I'm
 happy to announce that we will spend the rest of our lives together,' he said. 'I 
now realized why I was involved in the tragedy. It was to meet my best 
friend, and the love of my life.'

In a Facebook photo, D'Agostino showed off her engagement ring, with Lyon's carousel in the background. Hundreds of friends shared their congratulations with the couple.

His friends also suffered life-changing 
injuries, with three of the men, including brothers Paul and J.P. 
Norden, each losing a leg.

Another friend, Marc Fucarile, became the 
last victim to leave the hospital after 100 days of treatment for broken
 bones and a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart.

Mike Jefferson, the school buddy they came to cheer on at the marathon, was the only one spared.

The
 men, who met at elementary school or youth clubs in the small 
Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses.

As for Costello, he worked through rehabilitation, undergoing daily physical therapy to strengthen his weakened leg muscles. Metal shavings of bomb debris continue to work their way out of skin on his right arm.
