Cristiano Ronaldo, whose heat map is shown below, was largely kept quiet by Atletico -  CLICK HERE FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL MATCH ZONE

In the end it was the young man from Cardiff, the most expensive footballer the world has known, who settled an epic tussle between Madrid’s two sides in Lisbon’s Stadium of Light.

Gareth Bale it was at the far post who was on hand to head home when Angel Di Maria’s shot had rebounded off the leg of Thibaut Courtois and fell invitingly for him 20 minutes into extra time

In doing so, as he wheeled away to be engulfed by a mass of celebrating bodies and greeted by a roar of utter relief, redemption was found.

This might have been the final defined by his miss on 32 minutes. Instead Real Madrid have their illusive tenth European Cup, Bale joins an illustrious group of Britons who have won the famous old trophy with foreign clubs and Carlo Ancelotti has equalled Bob Paisley’s record of winning the European Cup three times: all thanks to Bale.

There
 would be a third goal from full back Marcelo, shooting from just inside
 the box, three minutes from the end. And Ronaldo would add a penalty in
 the last minute after he had been tripped in the box to give the 
score-line an entirely unmerited gloss. Yet it was Bale’s goal which 
finally broke Atletico Madrid.

How
 Real were made to work for those milestones; how close they came to 
failure. Atleti had led 1-0 with three minutes of added time played when
 Sergio Ramos’ header cruelly denied them a triumph, an almost exact 
re-run of how they lost this trophy against Bayern Munich in 1974.

In
 the end it was all too much. Their extraordinary coach, Diego Simeone 
invaded the pitch before the end to protest, bringing a red card for the
 Argentine. It was a seemly end to a brave fight for this team 
constructed at half the cost of Bale’s price tag.

For
 while recognising the achievement of Real Madrid – and in the end 
their sheer willpower and determination not to lose prevailed – it was 
impossible not to recognise the enormity of Atletico Madrid’s 
achievement.

Having won the 
Spanish league, they were but seconds away from a Champions League 
victory that would have upended the establishment of European football.

They had done so despite losing their totemic striker Diego Costa after 
just nine minutes, his unlikely recovery from a hamstring injury proving
 illusory.

Not since Jose 
Mourinho won this trophy with Porto in 2004 have a team of similar 
resources done so well. Indeed, Simeone puts you in mind of Nottingham 
Forest Brian Clough, pitch invasions and all.

It’s not just that they 
live in the shadow of the richer, more illustrious neighbours; until 
this time last year and the Copa del Rey final they hadn’t even beaten 
Real Madrid for 14 years.

And on Saturday night they were on the verge of something spectacular. They have 
already disposed of Barcelona and Chelsea and now they led Real Madrid 
with 90 minutes on the clock.

Time was running out; hope was slipping 
away. Real Madrid’s worst nightmare was unfolding before them, their 
upstart neighbours about to claim the victory to end all arguments.

Five
 minutes of injury time were indicated and Simeone was already furious, 
the first sign of the imminent breakdown. Three minutes into that added 
time came a corner from Luka Modric.

It was well delivered but the leap 
of Sergio Ramos and the ferocity of his header was something to behold.  It fairly flew into the bottom corner and a good two thirds of the 
stadium erupted as the Real Madrid bench sprinted to join in the 
celebrations.

At the last, Real had rescued it and pushed the game into 
extra time.

From thereon in, it was all about holding on for penalties for Atleti. They had given their all; there simply was no more.

They
 had started the game with customary gusto, despite missing Arda Turan 
and losing Costa.

With Simeone cajoling, encouraging them every step of 
the way from the touchline, they proved thoroughly disruptive with Gabi,
 Koke and Raul Garcia terrier-like in midfield.

Real
 were slowly constructing some coherent football, there best chance 
coming on 32 minutes from a characteristic burst from Bale after a 
mis-placed Tiago pass.

Space opened up and the Welshman sprinted 
goal-wards from 30 yards out.

A glorious opportunity beckoned but with 
Miranda sliding in, Bale was somehow distracted enough and ended up 
shooting wide, throwing his hands to his face as he recognised the 
importance of the moment that had just passed.

Atleti’s
 retort came four minutes later. A Gabi corner was headed away on 36 
minutes and then returned by the head of Juanfran, looping into the 
penalty area.

There was little danger until Iker Casillas, the 
33-year-old came sprinting off his line in a panic.

As
 he did, Uruguayan Diego Godin, who will soon take on England, rose 
above the Real defence to divert the ball over the unfortunate 
goalkeeper.

Despairing Casillas was already retreating, realising his 
error; he even got a hand to the ball, but to no avail. It was over the 
line and a manic Godin was off on a celebratory run that would end under
 a mass of Atletico players.

Real
 would strive for an equaliser. A Ronaldo free kick was deflected onto 
the bar on 54 minutes; his header glanced wide on 62 minutes; Bale 
simply sprinted past Godin on 78 minutes but shot tamely into the side 
netting. Real’s conviction was waning;  it seemed that the mighty were 
about to be unseated by the common rabble. It wasn’t to be; Sergio 
Ramo’s header and Bale’s goal saw to that. But it was a might close run 
thing.
