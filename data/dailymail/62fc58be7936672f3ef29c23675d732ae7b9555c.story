Martin Thomas, 30, is accused of attacking his four-month-old daughter Evie Grace in series of attacks

A father left his baby daughter with a fractured skull and ribs in a series of vicious attacks, a court heard today.

Martin Thomas, 30, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, is accused of injuring four-month-old Evie Grace on five separate occasions including striking her head and stamping on her ribs.

The infant, who like her father was born with Treacher Collins syndrome, has since died from unrelated causes.

Liverpool Crown Court heard the skull fractures inflicted on Evie were ‘likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument’.

Mark Kellet, prosecuting, told a jury that doctors believed the rib injuries were ‘caused by squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult’.

He said: ‘In short the defendant was responsible for causing those sets of injuries on Evie Thomas when she was aged between one month and four months.

‘Because of the force required to cause these types of fractures in such a young child, doctors can be sure these fractures were caused by unlawful assaults rather than innocent day to day handling.

‘In the absence of any plausible explanation about how she came by these serious fractures they say the likely causes of these fractures are kicks, stamps and blows, striking Evie's head with a blunt instrument or against a blunt hard unyielding surface.’

He explained that the symptoms of Evie’s condition - Treacher Collins syndrome - included, for her, poor formation of facial bones including the cheek and a small lower jaw which can be associated with sudden death in children because of respiratory obstruction.

She also suffered from colic which caused pain, distress and discomfort.

Evie Grace died in February 2013 as a result of respiratory failure, which was unrelated to the attacks

Hayley Fisher, Evie's mother, took her to hospital after finding 'a massive lump on her head'

He added: ‘Tragically she died on the morning of 21 February 2013 as a result of respiratory failure while sleeping at home with her parents - the defendant and Hayley Fisher.’

Mr Kellet emphasised that there was nothing to suggest that the injuries she had suffered led to her death.

As well as Treacher Collins syndrome she also had an upper respiratory infection causing inflamed lungs shortly before she died.

A full skeletal survey was undertaken after her death and CT scans taken on December 6, 2012 were examined by two radiologists and a forensic pathologist.

She had been taken to Wigan Infirmary after her mother, who was upstairs, heard shouting and later found her with ‘a massive lump on her head’ and there the scans were taken.

Thomas claimed that while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit Evie on the head.

After her death the CT scans were reviewed and along with the skeletal survey the doctors identified injuries caused on five separate occasions, and fractures to her skull and ribs.

Mr Kellet said the evidence demonstrates that Thomas's explanation of how she sustained the injuries was a lie.

He said: ‘The medical experts say these injuries are typical of non-accidental injury.’

Thomas denies five offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between November 26, 2012 and February 22 last year, and five alternative lesser charges of inflicting grievous bodily harm.

The trial  continues.
