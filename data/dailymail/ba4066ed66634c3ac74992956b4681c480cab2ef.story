My mum chased moths away from my bedroom when I screamed as a kid, gathering them up in her hand and throwing them out of the window, promising they turned into fairy dust.

She sat up all night to finish knitting me a school jumper for the new term despite having a full-time job. When my baby son was rushed to hospital with suspected meningitis 26 years ago, Mum dashed there and gave me the hug I craved as my tears flowed.

As her only daughter, we shared a special bond. And I always knew she loved me. So when Mum no longer recognised me and called me Margaret, after her 2003 dementia diagnosis, it was the loneliest day of my life.

Nothing could have prepared me for that moment. My dad had just died from cancer, now my mum had Alzheimer’s and believed I was someone else. I felt completely lost.

For the next eight years, I watched as the disease stripped her of every last semblance of humanity. Because of that, I know if I had to choose, I would rather have cancer.

That's why I was so astonished when Sarah Vine wrote in the Mail last week that she would be happy to take a new blood test that can predict if you will get Alzheimer's.

Why would you do that when you know there is no cure? What benefit is there in foreseeing yourself, imprisoned in a mind that, slowly but surely, is closing down?

"Yes, cancer is ugly. But it doesn't have 
to end in death. Caught early, there is hope of cure or remission. With 
Alzheimer's there are no survivors, only victims. You can't fight it. 
It's going to get you"

By the time Alzheimer's had finished with Mum, she could not move, speak or see. Her world had become a single bed in a small room. Why would I want to know if this might become my future, too?

Dad may have died of cancer but he was still my dad right until the very end, telling me with his last gasp to 'shut up' as I urged him to 'stay with me' and 'hang in there' - showing the flash of fighting spirit that made me so proud to be his daughter.

When my dad Ken died of lung cancer in February 2003 - just 16 days after being diagnosed - it was only five months after my mum Sheila had been told she had dementia.

She'd grown forgetful, had trouble counting out money to pay for groceries, despite having worked in a bakery all her life and being lightning quick at giving change.

Mum had begun to switch off the freezer when she came over to help me around the house. I left a note reminding her not to, but every time I arrived home the plug was pulled out. In the end I taped the socket.

Initially, I put this down to her age - she was then in her mid-seventies. One Christmas Day as we played Cluedo she couldn't remember any of the characters or pieces, but I fobbed it off.

I just could not believe my darling mother - a bright, organised woman - could have dementia.

Mum and Dad met at Leicester's Palais de Dance in 1943 when she was 16 and he was 18, readying himself for war. They married in 1947 - 'The same year as the Queen', Mum always reminded us - after his four years in the Navy.

They built a life together. My two older brothers were born in 1949 and 1951, and I followed in 1961.

When they left their council house in Leicester after 40 years and moved a few miles away to the village of Foxton Locks to be nearer to me in 1993, it was meant to be where they would spend a long and happy retirement. Sadly, their dream was cut short.

On a day trip to Norfolk, Mum, Dad, my teenage son Tom and I went for a cream tea. As I poured the tea, Mum asked for a knife and fork. 'It's a cream tea, Sheila,' Dad said. 'You don't need a fork.' But Mum was having none of it.

Shortly afterwards, in summer 2002, we took Mum to the doctor. He asked her questions, such as her address, the name of the Prime Minister, and, as I was there, what date I was born. But she couldn't remember, laughing to cover her embarrassment, offering Christmas Day instead.

I took her hand and said 'it's OK,' while Dad stared at the floor, stunned. That moment changed everything. In September, she was referred to a memory clinic, where a consultant confirmed, after many tests, our worst nightmare - Mum had Alzheimer's.

It took a while for this to sink in. We tried not to think about what lay ahead, instead planning lots of trips out to distract us all.

Then, in early February 2003, Dad was struck down. It seemed one minute he was putting up a shelf, the next he had collapsed and I was searching for his favourite cap to keep his head warm as we set off for hospital in the freezing depths of winter.

Loved parents: Max's dad Ken died from cancer, while her mum Shelia had Alzheimer's disease for the last years of her life

The next few days were a roller-coaster of tests, diagnosis - then disbelief that he had lung cancer.

My dad, an ex-council worker, didn't want to die, but after war service in Hiroshima, always had a sense of living on borrowed time. His reaction was that while cancer would kill him, he'd do it his way.

He came home from hospital on a cold, frosty Valentine's Day, slipping his hand in mine as we walked down the garden path together one last time. The neighbours rallied around, bringing his favourite food - bangers and mash and home-made custard tart. He got to say his goodbyes. He told me I had been 'a wonderful daughter' quite casually as we sat together doing the crossword. It meant the world to me.

He treasured each night lying next to the woman he loved and had married almost 60 years before; he reminded his grandson Tom that: 'It's how you treat people, not what you earn, that really matters in the end.'

"Mum's Alzheimer's dominated our lives for years, taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming"

Dad died at home on February 17, the eve of his 77th birthday, in his beloved bungalow surrounded by those he cared about most.

Yes, he'd been in pain but it was over very quickly and for that, I was grateful: Mum's Alzheimer's dominated our lives for years, taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming.

With Dad gone, I became Mum's carer. She had difficulty remembering he'd died and would ask, 'Where's Ken?' over and over again. In the beginning I would tell her he was gone, and each time it was as if she was hearing it for the first time, searing pain etched her face as she sobbed or screamed. I resorted to saying he was in the greenhouse and would be back soon. It comforted her.

When I moved house in 2004, Mum became anxious at every visit and once ran straight into the road. I reluctantly locked the door when she came over. I bought her a pendant engraved with her name and my phone number, in case she wandered off. I felt great guilt - it was like tagging a dog.

Within a year, Mum lost track of whether it was day or night and had to have Social Services carers. They called one day to say Mum had taken the azalea plant to bed, another time, she stuffed a bouquet of flowers down the toilet.

After a few years she grew paranoid, terrified 'a tall man' was trying to break into the bungalow.

As her speech deteriorated, she would mumble or repeat a single syllable over and over again. People would turn away as if she didn't exist. Yet she needed others more than ever. I can't imagine how afraid she must have felt. Her face changed, a blankness overtook her eyes, as if she had been switched off from the inside.

After three or four years, when she could no longer talk, I found new ways to communicate, playing Glenn Miller to conjure up the days with Dad and, when we could no longer go on trips, bought a box that played the sound of the sea.

Thankfully, her last few weeks were peaceful. Classical music played, I slept by her bed in the bungalow and waited for her to pass away. I told her I loved her, and that she would be with Dad soon, dancing one more time.

She died in November 2010, aged 83, eight years after she was diagnosed. But, unlike Dad, we never got to say goodbye. Alzheimer's doesn’t allow you that.
