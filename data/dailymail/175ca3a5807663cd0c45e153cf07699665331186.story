With Halloween fast approaching, these amazing pumpkin carvings are enough to frighten off even the toughest of people.

American Ray Villafane has taken his 'pumpkin heads' to a whole new level as these extraordinary pictures demonstrate.

Taking just two hours to carve, slice and gouge, Ray uses everything from spoons to scalpels to create his pumpkin masterpieces.

Freaky: This pumpkin carving by Ray Villafane is called 'Torment'

Based in the sunny state of Phoenix, Ray's pumpkins have become something of an internet sensation, and have led to appearances on primetime American networks such as CBS and ESPN.

Using his background in high art and his work in designing models for D.C and Marvel comics, Ray has sculpted intricate faces out of the common pumpkin that make your hair stand on end.

His carvings take in a wide variety of gothic gargoyles in keeping with the devilish theme of the annual holiday.

Ray uses common clay carving tools to create his Halloween pumpkin masterpieces.

The 42-year-old said: 'Not all pumpkins will look good and the most important thing about a pumpkin is its weight. You need to pick the meatiest pumpkin,'

'Sometimes I pick up a beautifully shaped pumpkin but when I do I realise that it is not heavy enough. Its wall is just not thick enough for the carving rigours.

'I also like a pumpkin with character. One with nobly ridges is good, so that I can utilise that in the carving procedure, like with sculpting noses.

'The sculpting has always been a passion.

'I used to be an art teacher for 13 years at a Michigan School called Bellaire school and one day I was approached for Halloween to do some pumpkin carving.

'I thought why don't I try and carve the pumpkin like it is a piece of clay as opposed to a large vegetable.

'It came out alright, but the most important result was that the kids at the school absolutely loved it.

'I used to arrive at school and there would be a dozen pumpkins just sitting there waiting for me at my classroom.'

In the beginning Ray didn't always get the results he was looking for, resulting in a few fists through the front of the pumpkins.

However, working for D.C comics, the home of Superman and Batman, Ray has honed his incredible seasonal talent.

'For the past couple of years I have been really sitting down and giving my Halloween pumpkin designs more thought than usual due to the increased interest in my carvings,' said Ray.

'Now that the thing has grown in popularity I am definitely feeling the pressure to deliver on the pumpkin front.

'The most intricate pumpkin model that I have designed is the Zipperhead model, which took the best part of a day.

'Otherwise, the models take a couple of hours.'

Over the last four Halloweens Ray's pumpkins have begun to appear in online blogs and have really raised his profile.

He has even made national television appearances and is preparing to debut his pumpkins at model Heidi Klum's Las Vegas Halloween party.

'If it is something that I am creating myself then I will do it off the top of my head, like the skulls and gargoyles,' said Ray.

'They are a pleasure to make.'
