Adolf Hitler had a photographer help him practice extreme hand gestures and body language for his hate-filled speeches.

These pictures reportedly taken in 1925, give a behind the scenes look of the former leader of Nazi Germany rehearsing his emphatic gestures while listening to recordings of his speeches.

The images were captured by Hitler's private photographer Heinrich Hoffman and were taken so the dictator could review them later.

Hitler wanted Mr Hoffman to destroy the negatives for the photographs as he did not want the public to see them

And the resulting photos show Hitler adopting a number of strange poses as he practices the bizarre expressions.

They show Hitler pointing at a pretend audience, raising a clenched fist, opening his palms as if imploring a crowd to stand up and frowning angrily.

They also give a rare glimpse into genocidal ruler's inner workings, exhibiting how he meticulously rehearsed his indoctrinating speeches long before he became the leader.

Mr Hoffman who took the pictures ignored Hitler's demands for them to be destroyed and kept the negatives in his studio

This resulted in Hitler wanting to destroy the negatives as he did not want the public to see them.

But photographer Mr Hoffman ignored his demands and stored the photographs in his studio until the Fuhrer was arrested at the end of the Second World War.

After that they disappeared into various archives and the pictures were printed in the photographer's 1955 memoir, Hitler Was My Friend. 

The pictures emerged when the photographer published his memoir entitled, Hitler Was My Friend

Historian Roger Moorhouse said Hitler was very concerned with his image and public persona

Roger Moorhouse, a historian said: ''He used Hoffmann as a sounding board, but never intended the images to be published.

'He experimented with his own image and asked Hoffmann to take photographs for him to review. Then he'd look at them and say "no, that looks silly" or "I'm never doing that again".

'He was a very modern politician in that way. He was concerned about how he looked and his public persona.'
