Giving birth is usually something a woman normally prefers to do in front of her partner or mother.

But Vikki Taylor found herself in a rather awkward position after her father-in-law was called to help when she went into labour.

Stephen Wilson, 61, was called to step in when she gave birth in the hallway of her home and had to use the laces from his son Simon's trainers to help deliver the child.

Sudden: Baby Isaac was born on the hall floor after his mother Vikki had just four contractions

Mrs Taylor Wilson was alone at home when she went into labour but husband Simon feared he wouldn't be able to get to her in time and called his father to help.

After four contractions, the baby arrived and Mr Wilson used laces from Simon's trainers to tie the umbilical chord before cutting it.

Mrs Taylor Wilson, 28, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, said: 'I woke up in the morning with a bit of tummy ache and felt a bit groggy but thought nothing of it as I had been experiencing that throughout my pregnancy.

'My husband had gone to work so I was on my own. Just after 11am I had a shooting pain in my tummy and thought it could be a contraction. I rang Simon and said "I think I am having the baby, you need to come home now"'

'He said he would, but he works 25 miles away in Hull, and called my father-in-law, Stephen Wilson, who lives about 10 minutes away to come and wait with me.'

'Thankfully, my father-in-law arrived 
and told me to sit down as the baby was coming now. He told me I needed 
to do one more big push.'

Ms Wilson went upstairs to get dressed and had another contraction within two minutes. 'I thought "that was quick", but I managed to put on a pair of Scunthorpe United shorts and a t-shirt,' she said.

'I then went down to the kitchen and I felt a big burst of pain and my waters broke. I was very scared and could feel the baby coming. I thought "I can’t do this" but I was terrified.

'Thankfully, my father-in-law arrived and told me to sit down as the baby was coming now. He told me I needed to do one more big push.'

Mrs Taylor Wilson said the baby 'shot out' and started crying.

Baby Isaac was handed to her while Stephen went upstairs to get a towel to wrap the newborn in to keep him warm.

Although Mrs Taylor Wilson and her father-in-law were thrown in at the deep end with the unexpected birth, he received step-by-step guidance on the phone from the ambulance service.

'She told him he needed to tie the cord to stop the blood supply and cut it,' said Ms Wilson

'My husband had some new trainers nearby so Steve used the laces to tie the cord before he cut it. I was so glad he was there. I was in shock. The whole birth happened in 15 minutes. It didn’t feel real and it was like an out-of-body experience.'

Mr Wilson, 61, a full-time carer to his wife, said the birth experience last month pushed him out of his comfort zone.

'When I arrived at the house all I could hear was screaming so I ran into the house to find Vikki on the floor,' he said.

'She said to me ‘I think the baby’s head is out’ so I told her to sit down and to push. After he was born I cleaned his mouth and rang the ambulance. She then talked me through how to cut the cord.

'I have never delivered a baby before but there was no time to think. Natural instinct was all I had. I stayed calm throughout and thankfully it was all over quickly.'

Mrs Taylor Wilson and Isaac were taken to Scunthorpe General Hospital following the dramatic home birth. The little tot had to be taken into intensive care because he was cold and had low blood sugar levels

Mrs Taylor Wilson and Isaac were taken to Scunthorpe General Hospital. Isaac weighed 8lbs 10oz and was taken into intensive care because he was cold and had low blood sugar levels.

Mrs Taylor Wilson said: 'Isaac had to be put in an incubator on a heat pad for three days. I had iron injections and a bit of gas and air to help with the shock.'

Her husband Simon was giving a presentation at Hull University when he received the emergency call.

'When I spoke to Vikki I could tell that she needed to get to hospital so I rang my dad then when I got home I saw an ambulance outside and the paramedic holding the baby,' he said.

Mother and baby are now doing well at home. The couple are also parents to Jessica and Jasmine, 10, Owen 10, and Tia, 11.

Acting head of midwifery at Scunthorpe General Hospital, Julie Dixon, said: 'It is extremely rare for this type of situation to arise. It is important not to panic but to contact ourselves and we will advise as to the best way to deal with the situation, depending on the circumstances.

'We would like to add our congratulations.'
