The last train home can be a tedious and drunken affair, but passengers on the Glasgow to Hamilton line were left stunned last Saturday night by an impromptu performance from amateur opera singer William Boyle.

William, who works in customer services for a parcel delivery company, was asked to flex his vocal chords following his fellow passengers  rendition of Let It Go from Disney’s Frozen.

The 24-year-old Pavarotti-wannabe left the carriage in stunned silence at his performance of operatic favourite Nessun Dorma, which was secretly filmed by fellow passenger Scott Thompson.

Passengers on the train can be seen looking on in amazement as the part-time pub singer belts out the number, hitting all the high notes perfectly.

As he finishes, the carriage erupts in spontaneous applause as the passengers give the shocked singer a standing ovation.

The amateur pub singer has never received any classical training and works in customer services

'When I got off at my stop, Hamilton West, they were all banging on the windows and the train driver even got off and shook my hand,' William told Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme.

'I'll sing anywhere that'll have me really, I do sing in quite a lot of pubs'.

The singer's performance was secretly filmed and has gone viral since it was uploaded to Facebook

'It was a works night out and I got the train with my pal as I didn't want to spend money on a taxi home.

'There was a few of us on the train and a girl noticed me from singing in the pub. The group of guys started egging me on, trying to get me to sing, so I thought I would just give it a go.'

Since the video was posted on Facebook it has gone viral, leaving William - who has never received any classical voice training - lost for words.

'It's a dream come true. At the moment I'm just trying to take each day as it comes.'
