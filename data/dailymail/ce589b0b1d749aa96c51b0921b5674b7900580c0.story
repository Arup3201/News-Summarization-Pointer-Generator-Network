Tragic: Connor Shields, 14, died after being knocked off his bike on a quiet A-road in Aberdeenshire

A 14-year-old cyclist has died after colliding with a car during on a bike ride with friends on a quiet A-road.

'Our enquiries are at an early stage and at this time it is too early to speculate as to the cause of the collision.

'The boy was in a group of five or six pedal cyclists who were travelling from Collieston to the Ellon area, and I would ask that anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or who has any information relating to this collision to get in touch with us.'

Local councillor Rob Merson led the tributes to the Ellon Academy in Aberdeenshire pupil.

Mr Merson said: 'My heart-felt sympathy and condolences go to Connor’s family, for whom this will be a devastating shock.

'There can be no loss worse than the life of one so young, and we must wait for the outcome of the accident investigation to see what lessons might be learned from this tragic incident.'
