Adventurous guests can also head into the nearby underground cities and hidden cavernous churches. 

In Paris, the Apostrophe Hotel near Saint-Germain-des-Prés is a stylish design hotel complete with an exterior mural of a tree overtaking the front of the building.

Australia's Thorngrove Manor Hotel is like something out of a fairytale, thanks to its romantic architecture.

It's castle-inspired towers and fantastical turrets are just the beginning - the hotel's interiors are equally as spectacular, boasting one-of-a-kind antiques, winding staircases, and escapist artwork.
