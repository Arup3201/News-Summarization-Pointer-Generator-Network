It was thought to have built by King Offa in the 8th century as border between England and Wales

But even though it has been part of the British landscape for centuries, the ancient Offa's Dyke may have to be renamed, after archaeologists discovered it could have been completed 200 years before the great Anglo Saxon leader was born.

Experts used radiocarbon dating on the 177-mile dyke and revealed it could have been constructed as early as the 4th century.

Ancient: Archaeologists have used radiocarbon dating on the dyke, which acted as a barrier between England and Wales. Results revealed it had been constructed at least 200 years earlier than first thought

It was installed to protect the Kingdom of Mercia, which is now known as the Midlands, from an invasion by Welsh forces.

The group behind the project said it is a 'tremendously exciting discovery' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke.

The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust excavations were
 carried out on a stretch of the dyke along the Shropshire border near 
the town of Chirk.

Paul Belford, director of the  Archaeological Trust, said: 'It's been known as Offa's Dyke for centuries but some sections may not have been built by Offa.

'It may be a bit late to change the name now - although it raises some interesting questions.'

The dyke, an Anglo-Saxon earthwork up to 65ft wide in places, was built as a man-made border between England and Wales.

It was built by Offa of Mercia, who came to the throne in 757 after the murder of his cousin Ethelbald.

He ruled the area now know as the Midlands and historians say he was the most powerful Saxon ruler before Alfred the Great.

Today it is a protected monument and The Offa's Dyke Path is one of Britain's longest walks - stretching rom Prestatyn in North Wales down to Chepstow in the South.

Change: Experts believe the 177-mile Offas's Dyke, which runs from Prestatyn in North Wales to Chepstow, may have to be re-named because of the revelation

The material came from an ancient layer of re-deposited turf underneath the bank suggesting it was laid down as part of the construction process.

Mr Belford said: 'This is the first time we have accurate scientific dates for Offa's Dyke.

'Certainly the dyke was built to make a statement about the power of the kingdom of Mercia.'

Until now historians believed the dyke was built by King Offa of Mercia during his reign between 757 and 796.

Natural beauty: The structure is a protected monument and is now one of Britain's longest walks

But the section of earthwork near Chirk have been carbon dated and revealed a 95 per cent probability it was built between 430 and 652.

Mr Belford said: 'It is likely that parts of the dyke system was in place before Offa's time.

'But it is also likely that he would have consolidated the existing network into what we now call Offa's Dyke.

'It is now clear that it was not the work of a single ruler but a longer-term project that began at an earlier stage in the development of the kingdom.

'Further work is needed on other parts of this enigmatic monument before we can really say who built it and why.'

Revelations: Archaologists said the new date was a 'tremendously exciting discovery' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke

Investigation: However, the group said more work needed to be done before any further action was taken
