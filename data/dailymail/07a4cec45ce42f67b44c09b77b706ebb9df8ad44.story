A Missouri couple have filed a lawsuit against a pair of obstetricians,
accusing them of decapitating their baby during his 2011 delivery and then trying to
hide it by shoving the child’s body and severed head back into the birth canal.

In a court complaint that reads like the script of a horror
film, Arteisha Betts and Travis Ammonette, of Florissant, described how doctors
Gilbert Webb and Susan Moore had allegedly coerced them into a vaginal delivery
against their wishes, and then severed their son's head.

The 10-complaint lawsuit cites Midwest Maternal & Fetal
Medicine Services, LLC, Signature Medical Group Inc and the two doctors.
However, the suit does not list St John’s Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis,
where the bungled delivery too place in March 2001, as a defendant.

Outraged parents: Arteisha Betts and Travis Ammonette are suing two obstetricians for allegedly decapitating their son during his 2011 delivery and then trying to cover it up

Touching tribute: Ammonette got a tattoo of little Kaden's hand prints on his chest last April honoring his deceased son

According to the court filing, Betts and Ammonette were told
by Dr Moore during a February 2011 appointment that the baby will have to be delivered
via C-section rather than vaginally because the child had an abnormally large abdomen, Patch Florissant reported.

But when the expectant mother prematurely went into labor on
March 22 only 28 weeks and five days into her term, the complaint indicates that
Dr Webb 'would not agree' to the Cesarean and 'would only deliver her baby by
way of attempted trial of vaginal delivery.'

Sued: Dr Gilbert Webb is a defendant in a complaint accusing him of forcing Arteisha Betts into undergoing a vaginal delivery against her wishes

The couple claim that the obstetrician also refused to let
them go to a different hospital for a Cesarian.

‘Believing that she had no other choice than to agree to a
trial of vaginal delivery, plaintiff Arteisha Betts consented to a trial of
vaginal delivery under duress and protest,’ according to the complaint.

The infant's head was delivered in the first stage of the
birthing process, but in the second stage which got under way at around 10.30pm,
the lawsuit claims that his large abdomen became lodged in the birth canal.

According to the complaint, Dr Webb applied traction to the
child's head in an attempt to dislodge his body, at which point the infant was
decapitated.

Citing the complaint, the Courthouse News Services reported that blood shot out from the baby’s arteries and veins, spilling onto
the floor in full view of the mother and Ammonette, who was sitting only two to
four feet away from the birthing bed.

The lawsuit states that Webb then 'pushed decedent's head and
body back into plaintiff Arteisha Betts' birth canal' and called for an
emergency C-section.

The doctor started cutting into the woman's abdomen before
the anesthesia fully set in, causing her great pain and suffering in the process, the suit
says.

During the procedure,  the doctor ‘surgically and completely removed’
the child's head from his neck and torso.

Before handing the little boy named Kaden Travis to his
parents, Webb had allegedly 'intentionally concealed' his neck wounds, although
the complaint does not specify how it was done.

The Daily Mail was unable to reach the couple's attorney, Christopher Wright of the firm Millikan Wright in St Louis, on Thursday. Calls to the two medical centers cited in the lawsuit also went unanswered.

The suit seeks unspecified damages to cover pregnancy
costs, funeral expenses as well as personal injury and wrongful death.
