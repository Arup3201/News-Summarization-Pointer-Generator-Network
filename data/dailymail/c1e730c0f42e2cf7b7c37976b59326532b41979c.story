Armed police stormed the homes and offices of numerous neo-Nazi groups Thursday in the largest raids ever conducted in western Germany.

Some 900 officers raided 150 premises across the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's largest, ahead of feared celebrations on Sunday marking a notorious firebombing of an asylum seeker's refuge 20 years ago.

In August 1992, hundreds of neo-Nazis torched the home housing Roma and Vietnamese people near Rostock, cheered on by thousands of bystanders.

Terror: German police uncovered an array of weapons including guns and a crossbow

Luckily no-one died in the blaze which has become a source of twisted pride for the far-right.

The
raids in western Germany came as the state's interior minister Ralf 
Jaeger banned three ultra-right Hitler-worshipping groups - the National
Resistance Dortmund, Comrades' Association of Hamm and Comrades' 
Association Aachen.

'The three groups were considered the most dangerous in the state,' said Jaeger.

The Aachen group was so violent that media reports said its actions 'bordered on terrorism.'

Two members of it were stopped en-route 
to Berlin in 2010 with bombs containing glass shards which they planned 
to throw at police and left-wingers.

All three groups were linked to the NSU - National Socialist Underground - responsible for carrying out 10 murders of immigrants and a policewoman over a 13-year period.

'With this we are tearing a big hole in the network of neo-Nazis,' said Jaeger.

The radical right continues to be a major thorn in the side of Germany although most activity is in the former communist east rather than the more prosperous west.
