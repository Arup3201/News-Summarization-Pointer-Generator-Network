CHRISTMAS CARDBOARD 

Recycled cardboard tree nigelsecostore.com, £7.99

Nobody said Christmas trees had to damage the environment. This tree is made from recycled cardboard but looks classy and elegant, with star and leaf shapes cut into the board.

Let your creativity flow by painting the tree any colour you choose, or cover it in copies of old family photos or perhaps your children’s drawings. The pack also comes with bauble and ornament shapes to hang from pre-cut holes.

TECHNICOLOUR DREAM 

Rainbow tree Paperchase, £45

Why stick with green when you can plump for a living-room focal point that boasts luminous artificial leaves in all the colours of the rainbow? It is 5ft tall and will be the talk of your guests, even without decorations. After all, you’ll struggle to find baubles that will stand out against this backdrop. It’s sold out on Paperchase’s website, but they are still in stock in stores.

CHOCOLATE TREAT

Personalised chocolate tree, notonthehighstreet.com, £83

Want a tree that’s good enough to eat? This one’s handmade, fully edible and includes Belgian chocolate leaves, trunk and soil.

A 60cm tall, 2kg version costs £83 (three smaller, cheaper options are also available). For an extra £1.50, you can add a personal message — in chocolate, of course. And the most extreme chocoholics can buy chocolate pine cones to scatter over the mantelpiece — again, with personalisation.

STICK IT UP

Personalised wall sticker, spincollective.co.uk, £28

The most minimalist tree imaginable, this one is two-dimensional and sticks straight on to the wall.

One metre tall and available in 20 different colours, this also gives you the opportunity to customise the bottom two lines, perhaps to include your family name or just a nice festive message.

You won’t need to bother with lights or baubles — but you’ll still have something to put your presents underneath.

With the help of a hairdryer, the sticker should come off the wall without taking any paint with it, but bear in mind that you won’t be able to use it again next year.

LIGHTEN UP

Rope light tree, lights4fun.co.uk, £29.99

Avoid the faff of needles and decorations altogether, and just have the lights.

This spiral of illumination should get your guests in a spin, with 160 warm-white LEDs creating a 1.7m tall display that can go indoors or out.

A beautiful combination of minimalist modernism and brazen bling.

LET IT SNOW!

Snowing and musical tree, clintoncards.co.uk, £39.99

This showstopper is for the household that wants to make a statement.

The colour of the tree and the festive red and gold decorations are the only traditional things about this.

For the tree, which is also available in silver, ‘snows’. A hidden tube pumps polystyrene balls from the umbrella-style base up to the top, for it to gently cascade down the branches.

What’s more, it comes with decorations and lights and also pipes out festive tunes (though, mercifully, it can be turned off).

Assembly is by hand — no screwdrivers are required.
