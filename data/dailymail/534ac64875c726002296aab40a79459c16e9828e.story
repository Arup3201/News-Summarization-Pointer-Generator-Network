The hustle and bustle of markets create a lively and exciting atmosphere, making them a good place to start getting to know a city.

A new indoor market in Rotterdam will not just offer visitors the chance to browse through fresh produce – it will also mesmerise them with the largest artwork in the Netherlands.

Measuring 36,000 square feet – the size of two full size football pitches - the massive digital mural on the walls of the De Markthal market has been dubbed the ‘Sistine Chapel of Rotterdam’.

The artwork, called the Horn of Plenty and designed by Dutch artist Arno Coenen, consists of more than 4,000 tiled pieces which are covered in bright images depicting fruits, vegetables and other produce that will be on sale at the market when it opens in October.

Arno said: ‘You could just look at the wonderful, almost psychedelic picture for its beauty, but the reference to the “Horn of Plenty” points out the miracle that food is there for you.

‘It is a work with a spiritual, religious feel to it. However, its larger-than-life size is not a tale of religion; it's about nature.’

The high resolution, large-scale images were possible thanks to the help of Pixar and a team of 3D animators, special effects specialists and a photographer.

Once the market opens, the artist will project moving animations on the walls of the 40-metre high arched building.

The indoor market, designed by local architecture practice MVRDV, will host fresh food stands including bakers and fishmongers, along with restaurants, retailers, 228 apartments and 1,200 parking spaces.
