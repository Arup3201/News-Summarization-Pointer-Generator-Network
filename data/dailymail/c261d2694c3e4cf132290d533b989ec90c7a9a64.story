Now campers can have the moon on a stick, with a luxury orb-shaped tent which lights up at night and dangles from the trees.  

The Roomoon is the brainchild of teenage designer Rufus Martin, who sites the tear drop shape of an onion, as his main inspiration.

The tents are designed to be hung at a maximum of three metres above the ground and operate a hoist and pulley system, so campers can raise themselves up into the canopy.

Cosmic camping: When the cosy two-man Roomoon is suspended from a branch and the lights are on it looks just like the moon

'When the Roomoon is suspended from a branch and the lights are on it looks just like the moon - just one you can sleep two people in,' said Rufus, 19, who is the son of an architect and and artist.

The Devon designer added: 'Honestly, I got the idea from watching my mum holding an onion in the air. 

'It just looked like a beautiful thing to be inside.'

Design your own: The luxury camping pods are fully customisable with a range of lights, sheepskins and colours 

Made from a durable marine canvas, the pods are perfect for the unpredictable weather at a British music festival or bank holiday weekend, but they come at a price.

For a hefty £3,500 happy campers can customise their Roomoon with a range of  lights, sheepskins and unique interior quirks. 

The tents are designed to be broken down quickly and stuffed in a full car boot, the shelter can be suspended from any branch, girder or scaffolding thick enough.

The portable two-man shelters have a flexible pine floor which can be rolled back to store muddy wellies and coats and a hoist capable of lifting over one tonne with ease.

It does this by making use of gears to pull the tent in to the tree tops; campers simply run a small chain loop through their hands to to use the mechanism.

'Being in the Roomoon is like being in a balloon soaring through the tree canopies. You really feel like a part of something much bigger and more important,' one satisfied customer says on the company's website.
