Vow: Humza Yousaf, Scotland's Minister for External Affairs, told William Hague action must be taken against Uganda's new 'draconian law' tightening constraints on homosexuals

Scotland has vowed to offer asylum to gay Ugandans facing life-imprisonment under the country's new oppressive set of laws.

Humza Yousaf, Scotland's Minister for External Affairs, announced the plan in an open letter to UK Foreign Secretary William Hague - urging him to follow suit.

It comes just weeks before he is due to meet senior members of the Ugandan government at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.

The anti-homosexuality legislation was enacted earlier this week, strengthening the country's already strict laws relating to gay people.

President Museveni also ordered one of the country's newspapers to publish a list of the so-called top 200 homosexuals, including some that had not identified themselves as gay.

Currently, international treaties say people must prove they have a 'well-founded fear' of persecution for reasons of race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion if they are to obtain asylum.

Urging Mr Hague to challenge the Commonwealth nation, Mr Yousaf wrote: 'Scotland will play her part in providing asylum for those seeking refuge from this draconian legislation.'

Today he added: 'The Scottish Government is deeply concerned the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda has been signed into law.

'This is a huge step back for equality and I have written to the UK Government asking them to make the strongest possible representations to the government of Uganda.

'I have also urged the UK Foreign Secretary to offer asylum to any Ugandans who suffer threat or persecution as a result of the legislation.

'It goes without saying that Scotland, 
where possible, will play her part and assist the UK Government in 
providing asylum for those seeking refuge from this draconian law.'

Uproar: The new legislation, passed this week, have criminalised the 'promotion of homosexuality'. Activists have blasted the laws but, facing life-imprisonment, cannot show their faces

Homosexuality was already illegal in Uganda, but the new legislation now includes lesbians and criminalises 'the promotion of homosexuality'.

Mr Yousaf's move was welcomed by the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC).

General secretary Grahame Smith said: 'The oppressive legislation enacted by the Ugandan government criminalising the LGBT community is an affront to freedom and equality.

'The STUC welcomes this initiative by the
 Scottish Government and we would urge the UK Government to support this
 proposal to allow Ugandans, under threat of imprisonment as a 
consequence of their sexuality, to find refuge in Scotland.'

In a previous statement, Foreign Secretary William Hague has berated discrimination in Uganda

The Kaleidoscope Trust, an LGBT pressure group, told The Herald: 'We 
have always felt the Games had an important part to play in tackling the
 scandal of LGBT abuses in the Commonwealth and welcome the Scottish 
Government taking the bull by the horns.'

Last year, judges at the European Court of Justice said homosexuals facing imprisonment may have sufficient grounds to be allowed to stay in the EU.

The existence of laws imprisoning homosexuals 'may constitute an act of persecution per se' if they are routinely enforced, the court said.

Mr Hague has yet to comment but in a previous statement he said: 'We ask the government of Uganda to protect all its 
citizens and encourage tolerance, equality and respect.

'We will continue
 to press the government of Uganda to defend human rights for all, 
without discrimination on any grounds.'
