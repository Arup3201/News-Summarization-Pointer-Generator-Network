Shots are heard echoing through the halls of a former elementary school, yet teens inside are seen scurrying for cover. Others scream for help.

'For every second that goes by, I told you this, you are going to have dead children,' actor Steven Seagal addressed volunteers participating in a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona last February.

The action start joined forces with 'America's Toughest Sheriff,' Joe Arpaio, for a training exercise on how to respond to a school shooting. It’s now being featured in a special for ABC’s Nightline.

'I am here to try to teach the posse firearms and martial arts to try to help them learn how to respond quicker and help protect our children,' Seagal said.

It was one of many exercises as unique as Seagal's appearance himself that was undertaken by a small batch of the more than 3,000 - and said to be growing - members of the sheriff's school posse patrol.

Arpaio enlisted Seagal to train his Maricopa County posse members with about 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18 used as stand-ins for scared students.

Seen hiding under overturned tables or scrambling away from an entering gunman, the children did as they were told and screamed for help.

To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used.

Purpose: The training, overseen by Seagal, was to help better prepare the sheriff's posse who are a collection of volunteers from the community hoping to take a stand against crime

'In January, 2013, shortly after the Connecticut school shooting which left 26 people dead and the discovery here in Phoenix by Sheriff’s deputies of a high school student’s plans to kill fellow classmates in a local high school, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched a new program using his all-volunteer posse to patrol areas surrounding schools within his jurisdiction,' a press release for his program reads.

Seagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work.

For some, video covering the graphic scene, however safe, did little to comfort.

'Images of simulated student shootings in school hallways splashed across the media are terrifying and do nothing to further the serious discussions needed by responsible adults dedicated to humbly serving our communities,' Ginny Dickey, a Fountain Hills Councilwoman said in a statement in response.

Arizona Democratic House Minority Leader Chad Campbell called the plan to use Seagal as an instructor 'ludicrous.'

'Steve Seagal is an actor. That's it. Why don't we also have Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis come out and train them too while we're at it,' Campbell said.

'I've put hundreds of thousands, if not millions of hours into my weapons training,' Segal addressed his credentials before the volunteers and media in February, a quote not missed by comedian Stephen Colbert.

'Now a million hours is technically 115 years, which sounds crazy, but then again so does asking Steven Seagal to train your posse,' he said on his program after.

About a dozen people protested the event outside.

'No gun should ever be in a school,' said protester Cynthia Wharton, a Fountain Hills resident.

Arpaio's 3,450-strong posse of unpaid men and women has for years helped the sheriff target drunken drivers and illegal immigrants, and chase down fathers who are behind on child support.

'It's important to help protect our children and our schools and we need to do that with whatever means we have,' said Rick Velotta, a posse member and retired General Electric manager who attended the training.

Last year, Arpaio sent posse members to Hawaii to investigate the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate at the request of local Tea Party activists, a key Arpaio constituency.

A sometime resident of the Phoenix Valley and member of Arpaio's posse, Seagal, 60, starred in big-budget films in the 1980s and early 1990s, earning a reputation as an action star in movies like 'Above the Law' and 'Under Siege.'

He more recently played a corrupt Mexican drug lord in the 2010 film 'Machete.'

Seagal also has been sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in a Texas county along the border with Mexico and appeared in a reality TV show detailing his work as a reserve deputy in New Orleans.

On Wednesday Seagal appeared alongside President Vladimir Putin, overseeing a physical fitness program for Russia’s youth.
