A woman shocked onlookers in the Afghan capital after walking through the ultra-conservative Muslim city with her bare legs on full show. 

The woman, who has not been identified, was pictured striding confidently through the streets of Kabul without the traditional burqa which normally covers the body.

Journalist Hayat Ensafi, who took the pictures, said he was stunned by the woman's actions.

They have previously, during the 1960s and 70s in particular, been allowed to wear short skirts as long they still covered their faces with a veil.

However, this was outlawed under the Taliban and is still seen as taboo despite their removal from power after the NATO-led invasion in 2001.  

One Facebook commentator called Sidiq wrote: 'It's her body not yours. Salute her courage. We want to see more women come out like that.'

Another said: 'My body, my right... no to forced hijab (headdress).'

However, one user, Ahmad, condemned the move, saying: 'We are living in a Muslim country and we can't bear such people like she is. 

The BBC's Syed Anwar said thousands of people have been commenting on and sharing the pictures since Mr Hayat posed them on Facebook.

He said: 'Not only on social media, but also in the streets people are talking about her, wondering if she is mentally ill or if she is protesting. 

'At the same time, some people have argued that [dressing like this] can pave the way for Taliban propaganda.'
