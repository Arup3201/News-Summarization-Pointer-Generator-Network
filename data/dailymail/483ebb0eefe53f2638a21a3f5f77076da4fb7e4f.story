The rumbling discontent among Everton fans towards manager Roberto Martinez is gathering momentum after Wednesday night's dismal 2-0 defeat at Stoke City left last season's Champions League challengers just six points above the relegation zone.

After one win in 12 games and only one clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September, it is becoming common to hear fans complain that the Spaniard is 'turning us into Wigan'.

The statistics actually bear out their worst fears. In Martinez's last season at Wigan, he had 30 points from 30 games – and went down. Everton currently have 28 points from 28 matches.

The Europa League, the source of so much pride earlier in the season, is now looking like an unwanted distraction. Everton face Dynamo Kyiv at Goodison on Thursday before their now-crucial next league match against Newcastle United on Sunday.

The following week they have to contend with a 3,000-mile round trip to Ukraine for the second leg. The players may not get into their beds until 4am on the Friday morning, just 60 hours before they take to the pitch at Loftus Road for what, inconceivably, could be billed a relegation six-pointer against QPR.

So what has gone wrong at Everton – a club who finished fifth last season and were tipped to be fighting it out with Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool at the top.

Here are eight reasons why Everton are fighting to stay in the top flight, where they've been since 1954.

THE £28MILLION NON-TALISMAN

In retrospect, Romelu Lukaku was foolish to declare he wanted to become the world's best player when he hit a purple patch on loan last season.

Everton smashed their transfer record to make a £28million move from Chelsea permanent in the summer, a deal that now makes Jose Mourinho look a genius.

Lukaku has scored just seven Premier League goals, fewer than West Ham's Diafra Sakho who cost less than a quarter that amount.

Lukaku's notorious first touch looks as if it is getting worse, not better, and he has complained Everton's style is not direct enough to get the best out of him.

Martinez must be desperate to find a way to help re-find his £28million centre forward's best form

Lukaku's first touch has always had a bad reputation but it has proved even more of a problem this season

MARTINEZ TOO SOFT

Martinez believes in filling his players with confidence and it makes him look a great man-manager when things are going well.

But salty old professionals like Sylvain Distin, with whom he has fallen out, Phil Jagielka and Tony Hibbert have been around long enough to realise that a good old-fashioned rollocking is needed at times.

David Moyes wasn't always popular with the Everton players but Martinez could do with handing out a few home truths like the Scot did.

THE DISAPPEARING ROSS BARKLEY

Valued at £60million not so long ago and feted by Martinez as potentially the best English player of all time, 21-year-old Barkley has started just over half of the club's Premier League games this season, 15 of 28.

At Stoke when Martinez had one last substitution to use to try and salvage a result, he turned to Kevin Mirallas, rather than the supposed heir to Paul Gascogine.

Barkley has played in so many different positions this season – holding midfield, out wide, No10 – he looks confused.

INJURIES

One of the reasons Everton are ultimately likely to get out of trouble is that important members of the old guard are heading back.

Leon Osman tasted his first Premier League action since early December on Wednesday night after a serious foot injury and his knowhow will be vital.

Even more importantly, Leighton Baines – the best left back in the Premier League – is pencilled in to face Newcastle having missed six games with a knee injury.

Aiden McGeady and Steven Pienaar are also out while Darron Gibson's midweek appearance was his first PL start for nearly two years.

Leon Osman is also returning to the first-team fold and could be a key man in Everton's run-in

LOAN PROBLEMS

Traditionally, Roberto Martinez has one of the best records in the loan market. Tom Cleverley enjoyed the best spell of his career at Wigan and last season Gareth Barry and Lukaku were big hits at Goodison.

But the Midas touch seems to have deserted him. Christian Atsu has hardly had a kick since he joined from Chelsea and Aaron Lennon was woeful and substituted after an hour at Stoke.

IT'S ALL ATTACK, AND NO DEFENCE

Martinez earned a reputation for concentrating too much on his attacking play at Wigan and history is in danger of repeating itself at Everton.

Despite inheriting a strong back-five from Moyes, Everton have looked less and less certain at the back, and the collywobbles have effected goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has gone from World Cup superstar to dodgy keeper this season.

The repetitive defensive drills under Moyes were boring but they did serve a purpose.

EURO DISTRACTION

Getting the balance right between Europe and the Premier League has foxed a lot of managers over the years.

Martinez seemed to be on a winner earlier in the season with his fondness for team rotation helping the club qualify for the knock-out stages in Europe while holding head above water in the league.

But the regular changes have affected rhythm in recent weeks and the league form has dropped alarmingly.

BARRY GAMBLE HAS BACKFIRED

Gareth Barry has been one of the Premier League's most consistent midfield players over the last 15 years but at the age of 34, he is becoming to look a liability.

Everton decided to sign him on a permanent basis last summer but his most notable contribution this season is to have broken the all-time Premier League record for yellow cards.

His caution at Stoke on Wednesday – number 106 – has earned him a two-match ban and that might prove a blessing in disguise.
