Amir Khan has thanked police for letting him park his £36,000 convertible directly outside the Oakland Raiders' stadium for the NFL clash with the Arizona Cardinals.

The British welterweight is currently out in California training, and has posted various pictures at sporting events in recent weeks.

And it seems that the best things come free to VIPs, as Khan was allowed to leave his Chevrolet Stingray right in front of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

Khan has reportedly got a fight with Devon Alexander scheduled for December 13th as he builds up towards an eventual meeting with Floyd Mayweather.

Khan postponed a fight with Alexander last December in the belief that he could face Mayweather in May, but the American elected to take on Marcos Maidana instead.

The British boxer  also penned a deal with American promoter Al Haymon in April.

As well as listing Khan among his clientèle, Haymon also advises Mayweather, meaning there is increasing hope  that Khan could face the WBC and WBA champion in the near future.

But for now, Khan's focus will be on his approach to his upcoming bout with Alexander at Mandala Bay Centre later this year.
