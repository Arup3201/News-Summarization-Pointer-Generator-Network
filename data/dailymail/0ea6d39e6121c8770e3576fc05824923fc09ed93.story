Employees at an Austin, Texas camera equipment store have created a comical version of security footage of a somewhat inept thief breaking into their store.

Last Saturday at 1:28am, the thief stole several items from Texas Media Systems.

The hilarious video shows surveillance footage of the robbery, set to the Mission Impossible theme song played by chorus of kazoos.

Breaking in: The thief finally breaks through the shop's glass door before fumbling with the green screen

Mad dash: He runs into the store wielding a sledgehammer

The thief can be seen incompetently trying to break through the store's glass doors.

Finally entering the store after outwitting a green screen, the thief, wielding a sledgehammer, smashes display cabinets and other items in his artless attempt at thievery.

With each item the robber steals, a graphic appears over the security footage detailing the piece of equipment and its worth.

Among the loot is a $60 mixer, a $299 boom microphone and a $400 camera.

Loot: The inept thief gets his hands on a $60 mixer

Smashed glass: The thief caused a lot of damage but stole just a few relatively worthless items from the store

The bumbling burglar darts around the store, at one point dropping an expensive piece of equipment only to grab a significantly cheaper item in its stead.

The video was posted on YouTube with the description: 'Our store got broken into. Judging from the surveillance video the thief doesn't seem to be highly skilled in his area.'

The second half of the video, which features the burglar trying to leave the store, is set to Queen's Bohemian Rhasody - with kazoos, of course.

The robber kicks his way out of the store, losing his mask as he goes, dropping all the things he stole and falling over onto the prone green screen.

Blind robber: The owners of the store, which carries very expensive film and audio equipment, can't believe they weren't robbed blind in the incident

Trouble: The thief slips over on his old nemesis the green screen as he tries to take the stolen goods out of the store

Getaway car: He finally leaves the scene in what looks like a rather expensive vehicle (seen out of the shop windows)

He finally leaves Texas Media Systems with a total of $1,358 worth of stolen goods, from a store that carries cameras worth upwards of $10,000 and a set of lenses worth $46,000.

Employees of Texas Media Systems note that the thief speeds away from the scene in what appears to be a $40,000 Nissan GTR getaway car.

The video was posted Saturday and already has more than 35,000 views.

The thief clearly didn't anticipate, despite robbing a store that deals in cameras and film equipment, that employees turn their misfortune into a cinematic triumph cum viral internet hit.

According to KVUE, the clumsy thief has not yet been apprehended.
