Izzy Brown struck a late equaliser as Chelsea began their Premier League Under 21 International Cup campaign with a draw against Borussia Monchengladbach.

The Blues had trailed when Mario Rodriguez scored from close range to give the Bundesliga side the lead just after the hour mark.

But England Under 19 striker Brown equalised with a looping header in the dying seconds to earn Chelsea a deserved point.

This was the opening fixture in Group A of the inaugural International Cup and Chelsea also have Porto and Norwich City in their pool.

Their manager Adi Viveash fielded a strong line-up at Staines Town, with the likes of Nathan Ake, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker involved.

The visitors from Germany enjoyed the game's first opening when Kevin Holzweiler fired over the bar but it didn't take the hosts long to click into gear.

Loftus-Cheek, who featured in Chelsea's Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon last week, was found by John Swift's right-wing cross but he couldn't control.

Reece Mitchell fired in a dangerous cross from the left that neither Swift nor defender Ake could get a touch on.

Baker, the England Under 20 international who has also featured for the first team, fired a 20-yard free-kick a fraction over the bar as the first 45 minutes ended goalless.

Another Baker set-piece early in the second period failed to trouble goalkeeper Niklas Bolten but the Monchengladbach man did well to push away Mitchell's curling effort moments later.

However, against the run of play, the visitors took the lead on 61 minutes. A quick counter-attack caught Chelsea out and, after Mitchell Beeney had saved an initial shot from a goalmouth scramble, Rodriguez bundled home.

Chelsea's response was positive and Brown met Jeremie Boga's free-kick with a looping header that bounced off the top of the crossbar and out of danger.

Monchengladbach were pushed further and further back as the clock ticked down and ultimately the pressure paid in the 89th-minute.

Brown was initially denied by Bolten's legs but the ball spiralled up into the air and the striker outjumped the goalkeeper to nod into an empty net.

Chelsea were well on top but, despite stoppage time openings for Kasey Palmer and Mitchell, they couldn't grab victory.

Their second match in the competitions comes against Norwich City at AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday evening.
