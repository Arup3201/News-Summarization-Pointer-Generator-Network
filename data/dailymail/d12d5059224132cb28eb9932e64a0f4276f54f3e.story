She had, as French President Francois Mitterand once memorably opined, the eyes of Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe'.

Now Margaret Thatcher has been named the owner of one of the most influential hairstyles ever created - all thanks to her trademark coiffed blonde locks.

Asked to nominate the most iconic hairstyles of all times, a poll of 2,000 British women found that Mrs Thatcher's look remains popular and even beat the long, flowing locks of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Triumphant: Mrs Thatcher's coiffed blonde look has been named one of the most influential styles ever made

Most popular of all though, was Jennifer Aniston's iconic 'Rachel' haircut, a look that was widely copied in the late 90s and early noughties following the transatlantic success of Friends.

Second place in the poll was taken by Marilyn Monroe's platinum blonde bob, while late singer Amy Winehouse and her trademark beehive came third.

In fourth place was Princess Diana whose short blonde crop came well ahead of her daughter-in-law's long locks which could only manage 10th spot.

60s designer Mary Quant, famous for her short graphic bob, came fifth while sixth place went to eccentric 80s singer Grace Jones.

Next on the list was Mrs Thatcher and her famously helmet-like head of hair, with Mia Farrow and Annie Lennox taking eighth and ninth places.

Like Mrs Thatcher, who kept her trademark style in place until her death last year, almost a third of the women asked said they rarely changed their look.

That was despite four in 10 saying they felt more attractive after a cut and 15 per cent worrying about men judging them on their hairstyle.

What all agreed upon is that healthy hair is important with more than a quarter saying greasy hair was particularly unattractive.

Sheryl Franklin-Worth, Corporate Affairs Manager at Amway UK, which conducted the poll, said: 'Having healthy great looking hair increases a woman's confidence and how she feels about herself.

'If she has beautiful, thick luscious hair then she feels confident and can achieve anything she puts her mind to.

'It is great so see that the women who came out on top are all iconic and powerful women.'
