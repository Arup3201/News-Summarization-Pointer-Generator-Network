A new face mask claiming to be the fastest facial on the market has gone on sale on the High Street.

The M&S Formula Advanced Skin Solutions Illumin-ATP 1 Minute Facial has been designed to deliver a post-facial glow in just 60 seconds, injecting an immediate dose of radiance.

The £15 product could be the answer to problem dehydrated skin as it works to renew skin in one minute by 'boosting micro circulation and reviving skin' through exfoliation.

It is said that after a month of use once or twice a week, skin will look less tired and dull

The facial contains a blend of ATP, 
algin (a moisture boosting seaweed extract), and exfoliating papaya 
extract. 

ATP is the skin's power source, storing energy and transferring
it to where it is required, giving cells an instantly available energy 
to power cellular processes such as metabolism and cell turnover.

Together, they help the complexion appear brighter with renewed 
luminescence.

The dual exfoliator works
to deliver a post-facial radiance to skin as well as a renewed 
smoothness and softness in record speed.

It
is said that after a month of use once or twice a week, users' complexion
will appear less fatigued and dull as the skin looks brighter, more 
luminous and feels more energised.

When the team behind the product tested 97 women with 'dull or fatigued skin', 94 per cent reported the 1 Minute Facial left their skin feeling renewed.

It is advised to use the product once or twice a week, morning or evening, and to gently massage it into damp
skin, allowing the beads to exfoliate.

You can wash it off after one minute to 'reveal 
instantly glowing skin'.

The range has been formulated with Swiss laboratories with guidance from Swiss skincare expert Dr Jacqueline Hill.

'Any fruit enzyme such as papaya will help to make the
dulliest skin glow, therefore your skin would be brighter.

'Cell renewal can
happen with enzymes, however I would be careful on sensitive and young skin as it
could break out. Some fruit enzyme can be harsh.'

Nude Miracle Mask (£38, nudeskincare.com)

A Dual action exfoliator that blends natural AHAs with rice beads to transform tired, dull and uneven skin. The price reflects the fact it contains Nude's pioneering ingredient,  n-probiotic, which encourages skin to  produce antioxidants and collagen as well as hyaluronic acid.

Astalift Intense Replumping Moisture Mask  (£10, astalift.co.uk)

Already a hit in Japan, the latest addition to the Astalift range delivers intense moisture and helps to improve firmness and elasticity. Saturated in a potent combination of active ingredients (hydrolyzed soy flour, rye seed extract and hydrolyzed elsatin), the super-effective ingredient in this sheet mask is Astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant extracted from algae.
