Many of Richard III's relatives want his body buried in York, claiming it was his wish. The earliest surviving portrait of the king is pictured

A group of relatives of King Richard III, whose body was unearthed in a council car park last year, have won the right to bring High Court proceedings to challenge a plan to rebury his remains in Leicester.

Many of his relatives want the body buried in York, claiming it was the King’s wish.

A High Court judge in London urged the relatives and other parties involved to act with dignity in deciding the King's final resting place or risk embarking on a new legal War of the Roses.

The judge gave permission to the Plantagenet Alliance to bring judicial review proceedings against the Justice Secretary and the University of Leicester.

Richard III was killed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was hurriedly buried in the church of the Greyfriars in Leicester, which was subsequently lost during redevelopment.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, in granting permission for a hearing later in the year, said: 'The archaeological discovery of the mortal remains of a former King of England after 500 years is without precedent.

'In my judgment, it is plainly arguable that there was a duty at common law to consult widely as to how and where Richard III’s remains should appropriately be re-interred.

'I grant permission to the claimant to bring judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of State for Justice and the University of Leicester on all grounds.'

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'It is ironic that the Wars of the Roses appear to be returning whence they started - the Temple.

'Legend has it that John Beaufort and Richard Plantagenet picked the symbolic red and white roses in Inner and Middle Temple gardens...I would, however, urge the parties to avoid embarking on the (legal) Wars of the Roses Part 2.

'In my view, it would be unseemly, undignified and unedifying to have a legal tussle over these royal remains.This would not be appropriate, or in the country’s interests.'

He said the discovery of the skeleton also involves the royal family, state and church and recommended passing over the responsibility of deciding where Richard III should be buried to an independent advisory panel made up of experts and Privy Councillors.

Richard III’s remains were discovered buried under a municipal car park owned by Leicester City Council.

Archaeologists from the University of Leicester were granted permission to excavate the car park and to decide where the bones should be reburied by the Ministry of Justice and agreed that the remains should be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral.

However, opponents argue that he would 
have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster as the king grew up at 
Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times 
during his 26-month reign.

Known as Richard of York before his coronation, he also funded part of the city’s medieval gated walls.

The alliance is a 'campaigning organisation' incorporated in March by the 17th great-nephew of Richard III, Stephen Nicolay.

In a written ruling the judge said: 'In my judgment the merits of the claimant’s challenge are clearly arguable.'

The “core submission” of the alliance’s case 'is that the Secretary of State for Justice had a duty in law to consult ‘relevant interests', including descendants, as to how, and where, the remains of Richard III should be reburied, but he failed to comply with that duty prior to issuing the licence or at any time thereafter'.

The alliance submitted the 'relevant interests' including the wishes of Richard III himself 'in so far as they can be ascertained or inferred'.

It was a matter which has raised a 'great deal of strong public feeling', said the judge, particularly in the two main geographical areas which assert historical claims as to where Richard should be reburied.

A total of 26,553 people have signed a petition that the remains should be re-interred at York Minster and 8,115 people have signed a petition that they should be re-interred at Leicester.

The judge concluded that the issues in the case “are of general public importance” and that “the public interest requires that these issues are resolved”.

The University of Leicester announced that DNA results confirmed the remains were those of Richard III in February 4 this year.

The university said in a statement: 'The university continues to take the view that the claim is without merit and that this is the conclusion which the court is likely to reach once it has had the benefit of hearing detailed evidence and legal argument during the course of the judicial review.

It added: 'Statistically, it is expected there will be at least a million relatives of Richard III alive today' and said it has received messages of support from Michael Ibsen, whose DNA was key to identifying the remains found at Greyfriars in Leicester.

The location of Richard II's final is a matter that has raised a 'great deal of strong public feeling', according to the judge, particularly in the two main geographical areas which assert historical claims as to where Richard III should be reburied.

The Battle of Bosworth Field was fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster.

One of the most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best known quotations.

The battle marked the final confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483.

Support for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel.

Following an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485.

Gathering support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.

After Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted until 1603.
