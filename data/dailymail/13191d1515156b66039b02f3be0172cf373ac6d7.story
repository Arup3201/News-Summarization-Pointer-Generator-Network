Convicted fraudster  Neelam Desai admitted a travel agency racket which police believe has claimed 'hundreds' of victims

She is a convicted fraudster suspected of fleecing hundreds out of their life savings in an elaborate series of holiday and dating scams.

So when victims of Neelam Desai contacted journalist Gareth Davies to say she was at it again, he started his own investigation – in the hope that police would follow suit.

Instead, it was he who got a visit from three uniformed officers – who then served him with a harassment notice for the apparent crime of approaching the swindler for a comment.

Yesterday Scotland Yard was accused of trampling on press freedom after local newspaper chief reporter Mr Davies was warned he faced arrest even for writing stories about Desai.

In an unprecedented step, the chilling ‘prevention of harassment’ notice warns that any attempt to talk to, or approach the conwoman could constitute harassment.

Mr Davies even risks prosecution if he attends Croydon Crown Court to report on her sentencing for fraud later this month. Senior Tory MP Rob Wilson last night called it an ‘outrageous and heavy-handed’ attempt to hound journalists for doing their job to expose criminals.

‘This is a chilling reminder of what can go wrong if the environment for journalists swings too far in the wrong direction,’ he said.

‘The police have got this badly wrong and need to think very carefully about their actions. The public will take a very dim view of them protecting the right of a fraudster ahead of protecting the public.’ Earlier this month Desai, 33, admitted a travel agency racket which police believe has claimed ‘hundreds’ of victims.

While bankrupt, she ran a travel business in the name of Nisha Patel peddling fake holidays – and wrote out bogus cheques of £220,000 from a cloned bank account when customers demanded money back.

Earlier this month she pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to a string of offences including fraud, running a business while bankrupt, handling stolen goods and selling bogus iPhones. But after the case, the Croydon Advertiser was contacted by a number of victims who said they had been swindled while she was on bail.

Desai allegedly set up a fake profile 
on an Asian marriage website using the photograph of an attractive 
marketing manager she stole from Facebook to lure men.

One
 35-year-old from Leicester claims he lost his business and turned 
suicidal after being conned out of £35,500 after Desai demanded he pay 
for them to go on lavish holidays through her travel agency.

Another victim contacted the newspaper saying he too had been scammed by a woman into paying £4,000 for bogus iPhones and iPads to raise money for homeless children.

But when the Croydon Advertiser approached Desai at her home in Selhurst, South London to put the allegations to her, she called the police. Days later, she claimed Mr Davies had grabbed her, before hastily retracting the allegations.

Mr Davies also tried emailing Desai twice – and was then shocked when he got a call at work summoning him to a local police station.

Three officers then visited the paper’s office in Redhill to hand Mr Davies a ‘Prevention of Harassment Letter’ which said Desai felt ‘intimidated and persecuted’ by his ‘unsolicited contacts’.

Mr Davies said he was told that being a journalist ‘doesn’t give you special privileges’ and that just ‘doing a job’ is what killed off the News of the World.

He added: ‘The ridiculous thing is that a number of her victims haven’t been able to speak to a police officer for love nor money. But I send her a couple of emails and I have three policeman at the door.’

Kirsty Hughes, of Index on Censorship said: ‘The police need to show that they fully respect the role and responsibilities of a free media.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the letter was issued by a ‘local safer neighbourhood team’, adding: ‘The officers did this to ensure that the reporter was fully aware that allegations of harassment were being made against him.’

Yesterday Desai immediately called the police when the Daily Mail politely asked her for a comment.
