A farmer has been fined after one of his bulls ran rampage in a small town in eastern Romania after he forgot to tie it up when he went to the pub.

Hercules the bull caused mayhem in Bralia while his owner Baltasar Nagar, 47, was enjoying a drink in the town tavern.

After a while, Hercules got fed up grazing on grass alongside the road in Braila and decided to hit the tarmac for more action.

Running a red light: Hercules the bull ran rampage in the small town of Bralia in eastern Romania after his owner went to the pub and forgot to tie him up

Hercules was caught on CCTV as he suddenly charged at policeman Eugen Vasilescu, 39, who was directing traffic.

Hercules impaled him on his horns and hurtled down the road with him before shaking him loose like a rag doll.

 ‘It was incredible, like a scene from a wild west movie,’ said pedestrian witness Andrei Neagu.

‘One second the cop was directing the traffic as usual and the next he is riding the bull from the business end of his horns!’

Witnesses came to the aid of the unfortunate policeman who suffered chest, groin and head injuries from his encounter with the beast dubbed by local media as the ‘mad bull of Braila.’

CCTV caught the whole episode on film, including the moment Hercules impales the poor policeman

‘He just came out of nowhere,’ said officer Neagu.  

‘I didn't stand a chance.  I know one thing now though - I will never be a matador. 

'When you see such a powerful creature stomping towards you, you have to have respect for it.’

Surveillance cameras caught the whole episode on film and aided local prosecutors this week to slap Mr Nagar with a £100 pound fine for leaving the animal unattended.  

He was also ordered to pay a further £100 in compensation to the injured officer Neagu.

Hercules was caught after about an hour, with the help of a veterinarian who tranquillized him.
