Responsible for looking after his mate's boat while he was on holidays, the last thing that Peter Estephan expected to see was the cruiser coasting along Sydney waters. 

Mr Estephan was driving over Tom Ugly's Bridge near Sans Souci, southern Sydney, at 12.50pm on Wednesday when he spotted his friend's $1.8 million boat cruising along St George's river - even though the owner was overseas.

The coincidental timing saw Mr Estephan thwart a joyride on the 52ft motor cruiser by three adults and one teenager who have been charged over the incident.

The last thing that Peter Estephan (pictured) expected to see was his mate's almost two million dollar cruiser, which he was responsible for looking after, coasting along Sydney waters

'Funnily enough, I'd left work early yesterday and was driving home over the bridge and had a look on the left and said, 'S***, that's Allan's boat',' he told Fairfax media. 

Mr Estephan called Allan's brother, who said he hadn't taken the boat.

He then called the St George Motor Boat Club marina manager, Mark Norden, who then called a local boat salesman, who thought he had seen a couple of young girls take it out for a ride.

The entire time Mr Estephan was driving around keeping his eye on the boat which was heading towards Captain Cook Bridge.

Eventually, he convinced Mr Norden to get a small runabout and the pair jumped in and chased the boat down the Georges River - just as the owner, named only as Allan, called from overseas to confirm the boat was definitely stolen.

'Everyone was saying, "Relax, who's going to steal a boat?",' he said.

Botany Bay Water police were then contacted and chased down the motor cruiser which was 'being driven erratically and at speed' along the river towards the Captain Cook Bridge.

The officers managed to catch up to the boat and board it where they allegedly discovered two men, a woman and a teenage girl inside but no one in control at the helm.

The stolen boat was returned to the wharf with only minor graffiti damage and the four people were arrested and taken to St George Police Station.

Mr Estephan is relieved he followed his gut instincts. 

'I wasn't gonna stop, I just knew something was wrong,' Mr Estephan said. 'I suppose I'm a bit of mental case.'

He has now gained the nicknames of 'Water Rats' and 'Miami Vice'.

But, rather than let the newfound glory go to his head, Mr Estephan and his son spent the next day repairing and polishing the boat before Allan returns from holiday.

Two men aged, 20 and 24, were charged with being carried in conveyance while the younger man was also charged with destroy or damage property. 

A 20-year-old woman was charged with being carried in conveyance and granted conditional bail to appear in Kogarah Local Court on October 14.

A 16-year-old girl was charged with take and drive conveyance and be carried in conveyance and will appear in a children's court on October 14.
