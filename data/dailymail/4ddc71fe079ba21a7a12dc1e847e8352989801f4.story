Laughing all the way to the bank: Barclays executive Rich Ricci

While most of us were worrying about whether  the Budget would leave us worse off, there was one man in no doubt that things had just got even better.

Barclays revealed yesterday that top ‘casino banker’ Rich Ricci had received a staggering £18million windfall.

And the jackpot was just one share of an astonishing £40million bonus payout split between nine Barclays executives.

But the bank provoked outrage for slipping out the announcement on the same day as the Chancellor delivered his austerity Budget – to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses.

Still, the Budget cuts must have seemed like small change to the flamboyant Ricci, who owns 11 horses which raced at Cheltenham Festival last week.

They include Champagne Fever, which earned him a £68,340 bonus by winning the opening race, and the provocatively named Fatcatinthehat.

In all, Ricci and his wife Susannah own 30 horses with Ireland’s champion trainer Willie Mullins, and have won £588,125 in prize money this season.

They are said to travel to Dublin by private jet most weekends to watch the horses train.

Ricci, who is worth an estimated £57million, was a key lieutenant of disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond.

The 49-year-old has managed to cling on to his job despite jointly running the investment bank when Barclays was fined £290million for rigging Libor interest rates last summer.

Yesterday’s jackpot, of £17.6million in shares from awards dating back over the past three years, is just the latest in a long line of big wins for Ricci, who also received £9.7million in share bonuses last year and cashed in a £40million pay and share package in 2010.

The bank’s directors, including Ricci, chief executive Antony Jenkins and finance chief Chris Lucas, all gave up their bonuses for last year’s work after the bank was rocked by a string of scandals.

But this week they were handed giant share bonuses awarded from previous years. It included a huge windfall for Jenkins, who has called for restraint on pay and promised to overhaul the bank’s culture.

In addition to the £2.6million he was paid for his work last year, he received awards worth £5.6million.

Critics accused Barclays of using the ‘lowest form of corporate trickery’ to bury unwelcome news by revealing the ‘grotesque’ bonus figures on Budget day.

Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre, a think-tank which monitors income distribution, said: ‘Just after we’ve seen one of the bleakest Budgets in modern times, Barclays is showing its insensitivity by engaging in the lowest form of corporate trickery.’

Len McCluskey, general secretary of trade union Unite, said Barclays had made ‘a complete mockery of any claims banks are cleaning up their acts’.

He added: ‘On the day the Chancellor cruelly demands more austerity from working people, to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses, Barclays bury the news that senior bankers are pocketing millions.’

David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign group, said: ‘A scandal-hit bank attempting to bury news of its grotesque rewards on Budget day is hardly evidence of a reformed financial sector.

'This tells you all you need to know – banks cannot be trusted to put their own house in order.’

Barclays was the first bank to be fined for rigging Libor interest rates and is facing a £270million fine from US regulators for manipulating energy prices.

It also set aside £1.6billion last year to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.

Despite this, more of its staff received ‘millionaire’ pay packages last year than any bank in the UK – with 428 scooping more than £1million.

Barclays insisted last night that  it had not tried to bury the news  of its payouts and had decided when it would release the information before the date for the Budget was set in December.

A spokesman added: ‘The share releases include deferred shares awarded from previous years’ annual performance bonuses.’
