LaShawn Evans who was shot in the head on Valentine's Day last year after discovering his wife was having a lesbian affair

The father of an army sergeant who was shot in the head on Valentine's Day last year has taken the investigation into his own hands.

LaShawn Evans, of Queens, New York, was killed after discovering that his soldier wife was having a lesbian affair with another officer.

His father Kevin Green, 52, has now filed papers in Brooklyn Federal Court demanding mobile phone and text messages from devices belonging to Evans be preserved, according to reports.

The papers also demand messages be kept from devices which belonged to his wife Florinda Evans and his mother-in-law from January 1, 2011, to September 1, 2011.

The US army initially ruled Evans' death a suicide but the crime was reclassified as a murder six months later.

And Mr Green now wants to know the full circumstances of his son's death, the New York Daily News has reported.

Mr Green, who operates two not-for-profit shelters for homeless veterans in upper Manhattan and Brooklyn, told the Daily News: 'I made my son a promise that I would honour him and fight till I know what happened.'

Lawyer Jeffrey Schwartz said: 'We cannot think of any good reason why the Army has not provided the father of one of their soldiers with information about a death they ruled a homicide.'

An Army spokesman confirmed an investigation was underway into Evans’ death.

Evans, 24, was found dead in his wife’s barracks with a rifle next to his body and a blanket over his head.

Green was told by Army officials that Florinda Evans and another unidentified soldier were present at the scene.

About one month earlier, LaShawn Evans caught his wife in bed with a female soldier.

The Daily News reported Florinda Evans has since left the Army, lives in South Carolina and did not return calls asking for comment.
