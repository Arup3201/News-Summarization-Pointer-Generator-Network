Fast food chain Pie Face will continue to operate, but the new deal will see many creditors lose up to 86 cents in the dollar.

ABC reported that creditors struck a deal during a lengthy meeting on Monday that will keep the company going, while much of the existing management team will continue to run the business.

The administrators for the company, Jirsch Sutherland, said around $7.5 million has been earmarked for the deed of company arrangement (DOCA) that will pay back the firm's unsecured creditors. 

Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch 

That includes $2.8 million upfront, with a further $4.7 million expected over the next three years from future trading. Secured creditors will be paid outside the DOCA arrangements.

The result of the deal is that those owed professional or trading costs will be paid in full, as will any employee claims.

However, other unsecured creditors, such as suppliers to Pie Face, can only expect to receive between 14-19 cents in the dollar on what they are owed. To make matters worse some will be waiting up to three years to receive that. 

Managing partner of Jirsch Sutherland, Sule Arnautovic, told ABC News Online that only around five Pie Face creditors were opposed to the deal, who were mainly terminated employees who wanted access to their entitlements sooner under the Federal Government's redundancy scheme for collapsed companies than when they will receive full payment under the DOCA.

Mr Arnautovic said around 20 Pie Face outlets have been closed since his firm was called in to take control of the struggling company, and about 150 staff have been laid off. 

The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, said sections of the franchise, were 'still profitable'

Despite insisting that it was 'business as usual' following their restructure announcement, 19 Pie Face stores closed last week while Fairfax reports that the company owes $20 million to its creditors.

The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, gave his global company over to the advisory and consulting firm, Jirsch Sutherland, who were 'conducting a review of operations'. 

Rod Sutherland from Jirsch Sutherland confirmed that some of the company's stores were losing money.

However, Mr Homschek told Fairfax that sections of the franchise, which is known to sell meat pies, pastries and sandwiches until the early hours of the morning, were 'still profitable'. 

Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch. 

The company assured that their 'international businesses are not affected' as two stores prepared to open in the Middle East in November.
