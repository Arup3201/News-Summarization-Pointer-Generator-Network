Inspectors found raw and cooked meat mixed together, filthy surfaces and poorly trained staff when they visited Marco Pierre White’s flagship restaurant in Birmingham, it has emerged.

The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill, which is on the 25th floor of The Cube, was given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers earlier this year.

It has now been revealed that inspectors found examples of cross-contamination at the premises including raw and cooked food being stored together and the same equipment being used for both.

A restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating, but said staff are working with the council to address the issues

According to a document obtained by The Times, the management were ordered to carry out a thorough clean of the surfaces and equipment at the restaurant and train staff on food hygiene and hazard assessment.

The steakhouse, which boasts stunning views of Birmingham, opened in December 2011 and meals cost around £50 per head.

The abysmal zero rating found the restaurant’s food hygiene and safety to be ‘bad’, while structural compliance was deemed ‘poor’. Officers also stated they had no confidence in the management.

The rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure, confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary.

After news of the inspection emerged last week, a Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said: 'Marco Pierre White was informed their Food Standards Agency (FSA) rating would drop and it has been published on the FSA website.

'A certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on March 25, 2014.'

Despite the bad review, a spokesman 
from Marco Pierre White said they have acted on what needed addressing 
and continue to work closely with the council.

The
 spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we received a visit from the 
Environmental Health Department of Birmingham City Council earlier this 
year.

White trained with Albert and Michele Roux at La Gavarouch and Albert once described him as 'my little bunny'

'The feedback was provided in an informal manner by the EHO with some recommendations.

'These were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive.

'We continue to work closely with Birmingham City Council and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice.'

The zero rating will remain valid, until the date of the next inspection, which could be between six and 18 months’ time.

The restaurant can call inspectors 
back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved, but so 
far the FSA has not revisited.

The Marco Pierre White Steakhouse joins a list of 140 eateries in Birmingham with a zero rating.

The
 Birmingham City Council spokesman added: 'In Birmingham most food 
business operate to a good standard, but if they fall below satisfactory
 standards, our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate 
enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve.

'Where
 premises pose an imminent risk to health - e.g. where there is an 
active rodent infestation, severe drainage problems or filthy conditions
 - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has 
rectified the problems.

'This
 usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper 
systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs.

'On average, we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year.

'Therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly.'

The news comes after it was revealed Jamie Oliver's upmarket butcher Barbecoa, in the City of London, was forced to close after failing a health inspection.

On that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings, out of date wagyu beef and mouldy cow carcasses.

Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral, was shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'.

Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana.

Dirty slicers were also found, as well as old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed to be relabelled with a later use-by date.
