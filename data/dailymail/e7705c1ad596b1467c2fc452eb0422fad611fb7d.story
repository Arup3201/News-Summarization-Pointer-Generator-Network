A teenager whose four limbs were amputated when he was just 14-months-old has scored his first goal with his soccer team.

Jorge Dyksen's extraordinary show of determination came as the 16-year-old played forward on the Manchester Regional High School junior varsity soccer team in New Jersey on Friday.

Despite losing his lower legs and arms when a skin infection prevented blood from circulating to his fingers and toes, the teenager lives an active lifestyle and is an inspiration to his teammates.

'I have no legs and arms, and I can do 
everything without them,' Jorge told ABC News. 'I can kick a soccer 
ball, I can hit a baseball, type, and even text.'

Inspirational: Sixteen-year-old Jorge Dyksen, whose four limbs were amputated when he was 14-months-old, scored a goal for his New Jersey soccer team in a match on Friday

Upbeat: Jorge was born in Panama but has been traveling to New Jersey since he was a child for new prosthetics and in September 2010, he was adopted by an American family

Jorge, whose goal was the only one his team scored in the game, was born in Panama and every year since his amputations, he has traveled to the U.S. for new prosthetic legs and medical attention.

When he was in the U.S. for the care, he met John and Faye Dyksen, who became a volunteer host family for the youngster and they officially adopted him in September 2012.

'He's always been a part of the family,' Faye said.

The parents, who have five children, said that two of the kids were 'weary' when they learned of Jorge when he was a baby - but when they met him 'all the fears just went 
away'.

'It was kind of like love at first sight,' Faye said.

He now spends nine months in New 
Jersey with the family and three months over the summer in Panama with 
his biological family, who had been unable to afford his medical needs.

Determined: He said that he never feels as though he cannot do something because of his limbs

'It was really a sacrifice of love for them,' Faye told NorthJersey.com. 'They realized that they could not care for his special needs down there.'

In the U.S., the Dykens throw yearly fundraisers to raise enough money to cover the costs of his new prosthetics. A pair costs around $27,000, ABC reported.

He said that he does not think of himself as disabled and gets great support from his family, friends and coaches.

'I just feel like a normal person because everyone treats me like it,' he said. 'I just keep going on and doing what I want to do.'

Assistant Coach Daniel Sanchez said it had been Jorge's aim to score a goal by the end of the year.

He said Jorge is an inspiration and 'big motivating factor' for the team.

'Whenever the team is down for any reason, he pumps them back up,' Sanchez said. 'Jorge is not only a great teammate but a great friend, definitely a team player - what every coach wants.'

Jorge hopes to become a motivational speaker and tell people: 'Never give up.'

'Because I know there's people out there that really need motivation and everyone says I always motivate other people,' he said. 'I help them get happy in their lives.'

Jorge made headlines in 2010 when New York Yankee Mariano Rivera, a fellow Panamanian and a hero of Jorgeâ€™s, surprised him at his 13th birthday party with three other players.

'He is amazing,' Rivera said at the time. 'He has a desire to live his life. Today he is going to swim. Amazing. People complain about little things. We should take a look at Jorge and make sure that we don't complain.'
