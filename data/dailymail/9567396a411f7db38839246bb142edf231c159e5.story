Comedian Noel Fielding said he was left 'shocked' when he was handcuffed to the ground, wearing gold boots and a boiler suit, while his friend was allegedly violently assaulted by police. 

Mr Fielding was giving evidence at the High Court in the case of Jimmy Browne, his friend and a onetime bodyguard for the late Amy Winehouse, who claims he suffered a broken leg in the attack in Kentish Town in north London.

Fielding claims he was pinned to the ground while he was still wearing his attire from a gig he had done at the 100 Club in London the night before.

When he was asked if he struck out, the comedian who created and starred in cult television show The Mighty Boosh, replied: 'It was Kentish Town so there were quite a few brightly coloured people around'.

Fielding said he felt 'tired and blurry' on the night of the incident and had had 'no time to change after the late night gig.

He added: 'I wouldn't normally march down the street in golden boots and a boiler suit'.

Fielding was with Mr Browne, who was stopped by police on suspicion of possessing drugs during the incident on Easter Sunday in 2010 – although that turned out not to be the case.

Both ended up handcuffed to the ground and Fielding admitted he had no clear view of Mr Browne being subjected to 'violent behaviour' or manhandled by police officers. 

He said: 'I was handcuffed myself so it was very difficult for me to see what was happening to him, but I could tell what was happening because I could hear it.'

'I was in quite a lot of shock,' added the comic, who said he had never experienced anything similar and described the episode as 'traumatic'. 

He accepted in court that he had not witnessed any 'wanton, gratuitous violence' by the police towards his friend, but added: 'I could definitely tell there was a struggle'. 

He said the pair had become friends after meeting in the pub and denied Mr Browne was his minder. 

Fielding's evidence came on the first day of 53-year-old Mr Browne's £80,000 lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police.

He alleges assault and battery over his arrest outside a convenience store, and claims he was 'grabbed' from behind by officers.

Mr Browne – sometimes known as 'Jimmy the poet' – once acted as bodyguard to Amy Winehouse and even penned an ode in her honour following her death.

The court heard he had a previous conviction for manslaughter.

However Mr Browne denied resisting arrest before suffering leg fractures when he was bundled to the ground by police.

The 53-year-old claims his right leg was shattered after an officer 'grabbed him from behind' and repeatedly kicked him.

Mr Browne stepped into the witness box to testify today, and insisted that he had done nothing to provoke any violent reaction from the police.

Mr Browne's QC, Stephen Cragg, claimed he was subjected to 'excessive force', but defence lawyers insist police actions were reasonable and proportionate.

The force has denied liability.  

Edward Buckett, representing the Met Police, claimed both Mr Browne and Mr Fielding were 'acting in a strange manner on the street'.

He told Judge Rosalind Coe QC that neither gave 'any meaningful response' when asked what they were doing.

When one of the officers followed Mr Browne into a Kentish Town corner shop, he saw him 'reaching into his jacket to remove something.

'He suspected that he may be removing drugs or a knife', the barrister added.

'Mr Browne was asked to stop again but walked away'.

However, the former soldier denied any lack of cooperation, insisting: 'One thing I never did was resist arrest'.

Mr Browne was quizzed by Mr Buckett about his criminal past - including convictions for manslaughter and robbery dating back to 1984, for which he received an 18-year sentence.

Explaining the background to the killing, Mr Browne said he had recently left the Army and 'made some terrible decisions and mistakes'.

'I have to live with that for the rest of my life,' he told the judge.

He disclosed that a security guard had been killed in what was 'basically a robbery'.

Mr Buckett put to him: 'Was a firearm involved?', to which Mr Browne replied: 'Yes.'

Mr Buckett: 'And you had control of that firearm?' Mr Browne: 'I did.'

The High Court hearing continues.
