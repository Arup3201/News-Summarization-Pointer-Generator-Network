It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding extravaganza, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons.

The Lebanese-born lawyer's Oscar de la Renta wedding dress quickly became one of the most coveted bridal looks - and now you can steal her style.

Esteemed designer Oscar de la Renta has created an Amal-inspired wedding gown, which forms part of his bridal fall 2015 collection.

Get the look: Oscar de la Renta, who designed a bespoke wedding gown for Amal Alamuddin's wedding to George Clooney has created a dress inspired by the lawyers as part of his bridal fall 2015 collection

Almost identical: It isn't exactly the same but the only obvious difference between this gown and the 36-year-old's is the length of the train. Here Amal can be seen having a dress fitting with Oscar de la Renta in U.S. Vogue

It isn't the exact copy - Amal had a bespoke design made in his studio - but the gown has the same features, such as the same off-the-shoulder design and a similar lace overlay.

The only obvious difference between this gown and the 36-year-old's is the length of the train, which may be a blessing. 

Indeed, according to Vogue, Amal's train consisted of so much fabric that it was too heavy for her 12-year-old flower girl Mia, her sister's daughter, to carry.

Plus, the price, which is yet to be revealed, will no doubt be lower than the original.

George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin sold their wedding photos exclusively to HELLO! and People for charity.

Style icon: Amal, who has been advising the Greek government lately, said that meeting Oscar made the design process all the more magical  'as he is so warm and such a gentleman'

Fashion's darling: From her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit to the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress, pictured, Amal has positioned herself as a global style icon

And a picture of Amal's dress fitting with Oscar de la Renta was also taken by famed photographer Annie Leibowitz for U.S. Vogue.

The acclaimed barrister told the fashion bible: 'George and I wanted a wedding that was romantic and elegant, and I can’t imagine anyone more able than Oscar to capture this mood in a dress.  

'Meeting him made the design process all the more magical, as he is so warm and such a gentleman.'

Back on home soil: The 36-year-old barrister - who changed her name last week after marrying the American actor - touched down at Heathrow Airport on Thursday afternoon following a four-day work trip in Athens

Amal was pictured being attended to by de la Renta and head tailor Raffaele Ilardo, who helped her into the gown made of ivory tulle and appliquéd with fourteen yards of Chantilly lace, its bodice hand embroidered with beading and crystals.

As her mother Baria and sister Tala watched on, it was decided the dress was so heavy that Tala's 12-year-old daughter Mia - who was Amal's only flower girl - would have to be helped in her train-carrying duties by Tala.

The dress was so gorgeous that both Baria and Tamal broke down in tears as Amal tried on the gown, Vogue reports, as de la Renta told the magazine: 'It’s the most important dress in the life of a woman.

'Any girl from any walk of life dreams of that special dress, and I try to make that dream a reality for her. Amal and I looked at a lot of evening dresses and wedding dresses together, and we discussed what she liked. That gave me the idea of what she wanted.'

The pair had a quick chat about veils - Amal debated whether she needs a shorter veil for the reception - and de la Renta told her: 'No, I think after the wedding you take off the veil altogether; you don’t need it anymore. Once you are married, you are married.' 

Speaking about Amal's wedding wardrobe and her ascent to global style icon, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe.

'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored classic dressing.

'Not to mention the most exquisite bespoke Oscar de la Renta wedding gown, equipped with diamantes and pearls. This is the kind of dress women dream about. It was truly a masterpiece.

'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try and emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence.

'What a women! What a clever woman!'
