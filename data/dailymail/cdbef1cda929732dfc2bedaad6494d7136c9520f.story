This is the 'incredible' moment humpback dolphins were caught on camera strand-feeding in Australia for the first time. 

The footage was caught by marine researcher Dr Daniele Cagnazzi and his team as part of a long running study by Southern Cross University. 

It shows the dolphin beaching itself on a mud bank to catch fish which have been washed up from the river.   

Dr Cagnazzi said it was large splashes in the distance that attracted the team's attention to the rare behaviour.

Professor Peter Harrison from Southern Cross Univesity said the event was 'significant'

He said: ''We soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event. The humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from and parallel to the shoreline. 

'This behaviour probably allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed. 

'On some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin's beaching, resulting in a full body exposed beaching.

Dr Cagnazzi, originally from Italy, has been been studying the dolphins of Queensland for a decade

'On other occasions the stranding was only partial with more than half of their body exposed.

'In these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin's neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water, thanks to the soft mud substrate.' 

The fish being 'rounded up' by the dolphins were sea mullet. 

This is the biggest study of its kind looking into rare dolphin species in Queensland.

Dr Cagnazzi leads the Capricorn Cetaceans Research Team at Southern Cross University and he explained dolphins around the world use a number of foraging strategies. 

'One of the most spectacular and rare behaviours is the 'strand-feeding' or 'intentional beach hunting' which involves one or more dolphins surging partially or fully out of the water and onto the beach to catch a single fish,' he said. 

These dolphins are in the Fitzroy River which is one of Australia's largest rivers and is a tide-dominated estuary. 

Kate McQueen says it is 'really important' we know and understand as much as possible about the dolphins 

The area features a network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges, providing the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour. 

Researchers from overseas are also taking part in the investigation into the declining dolphin population.

Kate McQueen, 23, from a small village in rural Scotland has made the trip Down Under especially to study the dolphins.

Fiona Wardle described it as an 'incredible experience' to witness the strandfeeding

She told 7.30 Queensland: 'It is really important because the more we know then we can understand what changes will impact them and how the population will change. 

Marine photographer Fiona Wardle, from Cornwall, England has been out in Queensland for the last two months taking part in the study.

She said: 'The snubfin dolphin was only found to be a new species in 2005 so there is still a lot to learn, in the last two months I have witnessed the strand -feeding and it is something new.

'It was an incredible experience to watch, it was something I have only witnessed on documentaries.'

Dr Cagnazzi said: 'You need to be in the right place at the right time (to see the dolphins), it is not easy.' 

Paul Birch, Fitzroy Bain Association assistant chief executive, told 7.30 Queensland: ''He (Dr Cagnazzi)  is now known as an expert in looking after the dolphin populations in the local are.

'We have got a lot of statistics over the years and he is gathering great data that will be used for many years to come.' 

Professor Peter Harrison, director of the university's Marine Ecology Research Centre, said the observation by the Capricorn Cetaceans Research Team was 'significant'.

'These new observations of complex feeding behaviours in inshore dolphins highlights the lack of knowledge we have about key aspects of the ecology and biology of these important dolphins and most other cetacean species in Australian waters.'

The study has also found the region's humpback dolphins, previously known as the Indo-Pacific dolphin species, have dropped from around 200 to 150.
