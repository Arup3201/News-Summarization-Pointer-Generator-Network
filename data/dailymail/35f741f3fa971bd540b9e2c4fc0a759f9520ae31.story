Pictures taken at the dawn of photography depicting pretty seaside towns in the West Country show just how little has changed on the coast since the 19th century. 

Captured by James Valentine, Francis Bedford and Francis Frith, the stunning landscapes have scarcely changed since when they were taken between 1860 and 1880.

Bound in travel books designed to inspire readers who couldn't visit the area, they are being sold at auction 130 years after being taken.

One of the earliest known photographs of St Ives in Cornwall taken from the top of Tregenna shows how little has changed in the area since the late 19th century 

Shop fronts on The Wharf in St Ives have changed over the years while cobble stones have been replaced by tarmac. The curving beach-front street is still instantly recognisable from the photograph taken in the 1800s which was among the first collection of black-and-white images of the area 

The three men took photos of Dartmouth, Torquay, North Devon, and pretty St Ives in Cornwall, which has noticeably fewer houses in its 1870s guise but still looks strikingly similar today.

Another photo of St Michael's Mount, near Penzance, also shows how time has stood still on the iconic tidal island, with the steep summit and country house sitting atop it looking exactly as it does now.

Pictures of Lynmouth in North Devon however tell a different story as they were taken before the devastating flood of 1952 which killed 34 people. The river has since been re-routed and hundreds of houses built.  

The four albums are to be sold on October 9 at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, where they are expected to fetch around £500.

Dartmouth Harbour has barely changed in more than 100 years with the spires of St Saviour's Church poking out from behind the waterside Royal Castle Hotel 

Rhenish Tower in Lynmouth, Devon, remains at the focal point of both images of the esplanade taken from sea. While more houses have popped up in the woodland behind it the tower, the view of the coastal town is very much the same 

A different view of the seafront town Lynmouth taken from the Torrs shows a similar landscape. Much of the area was devastated by the 1952 flood which claimed the lives of more than 30 people 

An early photograph of Lynmouth shows the River Lyn flowing between houses and buildings in the 1900s. Parts of the river had to be rerouted following the flood in 1952, with roads and houses cropping up in its place (pictured top) 

St Michael's Mount in Penzance has scarcely changed since 1900 with the exception of a causeway which is only accessible when there is a low tide. The rocky island is still home to a small community, with a 14th century Priory Church sitting proudly at its peak 

A family of women are captured at Hicks Court in St Ives in the 1880s while they work and play (left). The distinctive concrete arch seen in the photograph is still present today (right)

The town's harbour is depicted in the above photographs taken in 2014 and in the 1880s, showing how many homes have been erected since. The bell tower at St Ives Parish Church can be seen in both 

Clovelly in north Devon is very much the same today as it appeared in the late 19th century, with houses perched on a steep hill before the waterfront in the fishing village

Auctioneer Chris Albury said: 'Francis Frith and Francis Bedford were two of the great British pioneers of commercial British landscape photography.

'In the decades before the picture postcard, the coastlines, villages and local people of Devon and Cornwall presented these photographers with endless possibilities to practise their art and to make money.

'Their documentation of the changing Victorian scene formed an invaluable record and it is striking for us now to see what has changed and what has stayed the same. 

'The sepia tones and the figures that populate some of these photos add a haunting melancholy feel that is completely captivating.'

Francis Bedford, who compiled the book, was the first photographer to ever be invited on an official royal tour after visiting Bethlehem with the Prince of Wales in 1862 at the request of Queen Victoria. 

Francis Frith, a former grocer, was one of the founding members of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853. He travelled the Middle East and the UK, taking landscape pictures for the use of postcards. Francis Frith & Co still exists. 

James Valentine meanwhile was a Scottish photographer. Valentine's of Dundee printed photographs on card from the 1960s. 

The albums are being sold at auction this month after more than 100 years. Francis Bedford was among three men whose created the first postcard from Britain
