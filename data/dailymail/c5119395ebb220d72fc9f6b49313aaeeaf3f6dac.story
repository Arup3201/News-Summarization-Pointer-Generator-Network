A woman's mummified body has been discovered in her car inside her garage and investigators believe that she has been dead for several years.

The woman's identity has not been released but she is believed to be the owner of the Detroit home where she was found.

The body was discovered on Wednesday when a contractor went into the house because it is going into foreclosure.

Crime scene? A woman was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep inside the garage of her Detroit home and she may have been there for upwards of three years

Local station WXYZ reports that the contractor found the woman, who is said to be in her 40s, in the backseat of her Jeep Liberty.

The woman was German and worked at one of the 'Big Three' car companies- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler- who all have their headquarters in the region.

She was also thought to have a son, but his age and whereabouts remain a mystery.

Neighbors on Savannah Road in the Pontiac neighborhood said that the woman kept to herself and travelled often so it was not unusual to not see her for long periods of time.

No activity: Neighbors said the owner, who was a German woman in her 40s, traveled extensively for work and was gone for long periods of time

One neighbor said that the last time they saw any activity at the home was three years ago, while another last remembers seeing the woman six years ago.

'She didn’t really talk to anyone.  I’m sure she was a nice lady. She really kept to herself.  We never really heard anything from her,' neighbor Caitlyn Talbot told WXYZ.

'She was probably there for a couple of days, then she’d leave for a week, then she’d come back.  Then she’d leave for a month and come back.

'You’d think because of her job, and we heard she had a son, so you’d think someone would’ve come looking for her.'

The Oakland County Sheriff's department have not yet released her name as they are searching for any living relatives.
