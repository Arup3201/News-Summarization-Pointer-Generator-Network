It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind.

Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity.

Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other.

Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots

Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments

As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground

Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts

It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell.

Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies.

When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground.

But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work.

These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building.

Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth.

Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings

These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom.

Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk.

'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.'

The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves.

Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods.

The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month.

The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened.
