Tasered: Ryan Colclough, a winger with Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra, taunted officers sent to arrest him after he allegedly attacked a bouncer

Police tasered a young League One football ace who bellowed 'You won't get me now!' at them after climbing a tree in a drunken bid to escape arrest.

Ryan Colclough, a winger with Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra, taunted officers sent to arrest him after he allegedly attacked a bouncer during a night out in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.

But the 20-year-old League One player's bravado came to an abrupt end. Police tasered him after he leapt down from the tree, then pepper sprayed him when he continued to resist arrest.

This morning he escaped a jail sentence despite admitting resisting two police officers in an earlier hearing and having a previous conviction for violence.

Magistrates were told police wanted to detain the 20 year-old father in connection with an alleged attack that took place during a night out.

Colclough had been due to stand trial accused of assaulting bouncer Adrian Chell by beating, but the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence.

Prosecutor Sue Hayers told North Staffordshire magistrates police also had to use a PAVA spray during the struggle to incapacitate Colclough, who was 19 at the time.

She said: 'Police were set to arrest Colclough in connection with an alleged assault. He made off from officers who attempted to detain him.

'The defendant climbed a tree and was heard shouting "you won’t get me now".

'After coming down, he entered a compound. The defendant was described as hunching his shoulders and clenching his fists.

'Police used their taser and he went to the floor. He struggled and did not allow his wrist to be handcuffed.'

Colclough, of Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent, was ordered to pay a fines and costs totalling £580 following the incident on November 23.

Simon Dykes, defending, said his client committed the offence during a 'difficult period' in his career when he was not playing due to injury.

'These are actions he regrets. This isn’t the normal way which he would behave,' Mr Dykes told the court.

'He had been drinking and it had an effect on him. He was out in Burslem with friends. He was drunk on the occasion and it wasn’t an excuse but we need to put his behaviour in context.

'He was clearly fearful of what would happen if he was arrested.

'He is a professional footballer for Crewe Alexandra and he did not want to have to explain his actions.

'He realises it could jeopardise what he hopes to be a long and successful career.

'He had suffered a stomach injury and had to have an operation. He was injured for months and unable to play. He had a lot more time on his hands than normal.

'He normally has a quiet life. He has a partner and child and he takes his profession very seriously.

'It is fortunate his club remain supportive of him and although they aren’t happy about the fact he has appeared before the court, they continue to assist him to make sure nothing like this happens again.'

Court: Colclough escaped jail despite admitting resisting police at an earlier hearing and having a previous conviction for violence. Charges relating to his alleged assault were dismissed due to lack of evidence

Mr Dykes told the court Colclough had been involved in another incident where he received a community order.

He added: 'He has completed all the hours of unpaid work in relation to that matter and has taken anger management courses.

'This has been a difficult experience for Mr Colclough and one he wishes to put behind him.

'He knows how close he could come to losing everything if he behaves like this again. He does realise he is in a privileged position.'

Chairman of the bench Sue Corfield told Colclough: 'This is the second similar offence within 12 months. You could put your career in jeopardy if you keep appearing in court.

'You are to continue with the community order especially anger management.'

Today Crewe Alexandra refused to comment on the matter.
