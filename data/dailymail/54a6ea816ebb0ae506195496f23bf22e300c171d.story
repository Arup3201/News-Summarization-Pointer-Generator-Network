A photographer hoping to capture the perfect shot of a snowy field in Tennessee ended up saving the life of a missing elderly woman who he found huddled on the ground near a crashed car.

Patricia Madden, 74, of Bellevue, went missing on Wednesday when she failed to show up at a horse farm. 

She was found on Friday morning by photographer Keith Sheldon, who rode up a little-used road in Franklin, Tennessee to find a quiet place to shoot around 9.30am.

It was when he was started snapping that he noticed something in the scene wasn't right.

A photographer found a missing woman frozen to the ground - but alive - in a Tennessee field on Friday 

The woman, identified as 74-year-old Patricia Madden - had been missing for two days in the freezing temperatures

Nearby he noticed an abandoned car, crashed into a ditch and beyond that a mound that he soon realized was a woman's body, curled up in the fetal position with her hands in her brown coat. It was only 12 degrees out. 

'She was lying right there against that dirt bank and she blended in, [she] had a brown coat on and it looked just like the dirt,' Sheldon told WKRN. 

When Sheldon called out to the woman and she didn't respond, he walked over and noticed she was indeed still alive.

'When I got next to her, she opened her eyes,' Sheldon said.

He then called 911 and waited the ten minutes it took paramedics to arrive on the small rural road. 

It was so cold out that when Sheldon and paramedics tried to lift Madden up from the ground, they heard the ground crack as it released her frozen-on coat. 

Madden was taken to the hospital where she was treated for hypothermia and released to her family the next day. It's now known how long she was outside for.

Her family says this isn't the first time Madden has gone missing and that she has suffered a series of 'brain injuries' from horseback riding which may have disoriented her.

Madden's daughter added that her mother didn't have the insight not to drive in a rural area in icy conditions, according to WKRN. 

On Saturday  her daughter issued a thank you not to first responders and city leaders who helped run the search for her mother. 

The letter reads: 'I am writing to give my family’s heartfelt thanks to the men and women… who helped rescue my mom.

'I know that law enforcement’s reputation has taken a hit recently, but my faith in greater good and the service of our officers has never wavered.

At least 30 people have died in Tennessee this past week as a winter storm has raged across the region. Sheldon is glad that he helped save one more fatality from appearing on that list.

'I was sent there for a reason,' he told WSMV.
