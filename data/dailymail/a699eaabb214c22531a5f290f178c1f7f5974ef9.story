It could be any picture-postcard image of a family playing happily on the beach.

But moments after this photograph was taken, these four boys were dead - wiped out by an Israeli shell as they ran for their lives.

The children were killed in Gaza yesterday as more than 100,000 Palestinians were urged to evacuate their homes ahead of a possible ground offensive and new air attacks.

A second picture also emerged on Twitter that is believed to show a different view of the boys as they scrambled across the sand.

Haunting: This picture has emerged showing four Palestinian boys from the same family running on a beach in Gaza moments before they were killed by an Israeli shell

Officials said the boys were members 
of a well-known local fishing family and died in shelling from an 
Israeli gunboat off Gaza’s Mediterranean coast that also injured several
 others, including another child.

They
 were named as Ahed Bakr, aged 10, Zakaria, 10, and two other boys from 
the Bakr family, both named Mohammad, aged 11 and nine.

The boys’ uncle, Abdel Kareem Baker, 41, described it as ‘a cold blooded massacre’ and mocked Israel’s use of advanced technology in failing to identify children playing.

Witnesses told how shells had hit the beach and then a pier strutting into the sea as a group of injured men and boys tried to flee to safety.

Terror: Young Palestinian children cry during the funeral of four of their relatives in Gaza City this afternoon. The four boys - all from the Bakr family - were killed as Israel shelled a beach earlier in the day

While the boys were killed on the beach, several others were hit as they ran near tents and chairs set out on the beach area.

The
 pictures emerged as Israel began firing shells at what it calls 'terror targets' inside the Gaza Strip within 20 minutes of the UN-brokered ceasefire ending.

Palestinian militants responded by launching their homemade rockets across the border into southern Israel.

Earlier, the Israeli army said three mortar shells fired from Gaza hit southern Israel today just over two hours after the ceasefire took effect.

Police had said two rockets fell in open areas in southern Israel, causing no damage or injuries, two hours after the ceasefire began.

It came after Israel and Hamas started observing a five-hour humanitarian ceasefire following a request by the United Nations so supplies could be delivered to Gaza.

Fighting had continued in the lead-up to the start of the ceasefire. Police in the southern Gaza town of Rafah said tank shells landed on a house, killing at least three civilians.

The Israeli military said 15 rockets were fired into Israel this morning. It also said it prevented an attack by 13 militants who infiltrated Israel through a tunnel from Gaza.

The cross-border fighting has so far killed more than 220 Palestinians and an Israeli, according to officials.

Despite the apparent eagerness to 
resume fighting after today's UN-brokered ceasefire expired, there is still hope that a permanent Egypt-brokered ceasefire
 could come into place early tomorrow morning.

Negotiations are ongoing in Cairo to bring the 10-day conflict to a close - although both sides this afternoon denied reports that a deal had already been struck.

Earlier an unnamed Israeli official had claimed senior government representatives had accepted the Egyptian proposal, but said it still had to be approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making security cabinet before coming in to place tomorrow at 06:00 local time (04:00 BST).

But Israel's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman this afternoon branded the official's claims 'as of now incorrect'. Senior figures within Hamas also confirmed that a conclusion had not been reached and said talks are ongoing.  

The Israeli army says say it foiled a 'major' terrorist attack on a small village close to the border with Gaza this morning, just hours before a 'humanitarian' ceasefire was due to begin.

A group of 13 militants suffered a direct hit from an airstrike just seconds before they planned to climb into a purpose-built tunnel leading from the Palestinian territory into the village of Kibbutz Sufa, which is very close to the Israeli border with both Gaza and Egypt.

Residents of Kibbutz Sufa were told to stay indoors for several hours after the confrontation - raw footage of which was later posted on Live Leak - as it was not clear if all the militants had been killed, or whether some made it into the tunnel and still posed a threat.

Attack: A group of 13 militants suffered a direct hit from an airstrike just seconds before they planned to climb into a purpose-built tunnel leading from inside the Palestinian territory into the village of Kibbutz Sufa, which is very close to the Israeli border with both Gaza and Egypt

Plot: On its website, Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for the thwarted attack, saying its special forces had actually gone beyond 'enemy lines near Sufa', and had only come under fire from the Israeli military after the 'completion of its mission'

The thwarted attack came just hours before the start of a five-hour 'humanitarian' ceasefire - agreed to by Hamas and brokered by the United Nations - which Israel said would allow Palestinians to stock up on food and water supplies, and withdraw money from banks before shelling resumed.

On its website, Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its special forces had actually gone beyond 'enemy lines near Sufa', and had only come under fire from the Israeli military after the 'completion of its mission'.

The statement did not explain what that mission had been.

Under fire: The Israeli army suggested they had been watching the men for some time, and launched an attack before they were able to get into the tunnel. It said it had deployed aircraft and other forces to block the infiltration

Blast: The thwarted attack came just hours before the start of a five-hour 'humanitarian' ceasefire agreed to by Hamas and brokered by the United Nations

Hamas also claimed that all of the militants involved in the attack returned to Gaza safely.

The Israeli army contradicted both of those claims, suggesting they had been watching the men for some time, and launched an attack before they were able to climb into the tunnel. It said it had deployed aircraft and other forces to block the infiltration. 

Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, an army spokesman, said the interception had 'foiled a terror attack that could have had devastating and deadly consequences'.
