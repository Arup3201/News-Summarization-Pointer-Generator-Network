A rare Jewish manuscript created for the Oppenheimer banking dynasty will go under the hammer after it was discovered in a soup box in a garage in north Manchester.

The ancient Haggadah, a book read by Jewish people on the first night of Passover, dates from 1726 and is exquisitely illustrated by a famous Jewish scribe.

The handwritten 20-leaf manuscript is expected to fetch up to £500,000 when it goes on auction in Macclesfield at the end of this week.

It was brought to Britain by its late owners fleeing the Nazis before the start of World War II.

But it was only when the owner died in 2007 and her unnamed niece decided to sell some of the items that the precious pages were found.

Auctioneer Bill Forrest was completing a routine valuation at the Bury home and found it tucked inside a kosher soup carton, The Independent reported.

An expert in Amsterdam then concluded that the manuscript was the work of Aaron Wolff Herlingen, a scribe to the Imperial Court in Vienna in the mid-18th century.

It is believed that it commissioned to mark the birth of Emanuel Mendel Oppenheimer, the first child of Samuel Emanuel Oppenheimer of Vienna and a close descendant of the great banker Samuel Oppenheimer, the Bury Times reported.

The family had no idea they housed such a precious artefact and wish to remain anonymous.

Samuel Oppenheimer, born 1635, was a favourite Emperor Leopold I, to whom he advanced considerable sums of money for the Turkish war.

When Oppenheimer died, the state refused to honor its debts to his heir Emanuel and had his firm declared bankrupt.
