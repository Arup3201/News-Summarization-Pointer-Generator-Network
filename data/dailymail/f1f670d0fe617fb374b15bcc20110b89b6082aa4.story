When Jayson Parker knocked on the door out a suburban house in Ormond Beach, Florida, he was expecting to be greeted by a 14-year-old girl and her mother, who had advertised her teenage daughter online for sex.

Video captures the moment the 27-year-old, who works for a flooring company, received a very different surprise.

A dozen huge, heavily armed Volusia County sheriff's deputies suddenly burst through the door, from inside the home and grab him.

More than he bargained for: Parker is handcuffed by the officers and then arrested as part of a five-day sex sting

Charged: Parker is just one of 27 men arrested in the sting -- all of whom believed they were meeting a 14-year-old girl to have sex with her

He stumbles backward, seemingly in disbelief, before he is hauled inside the house, pushed to the floor and handcuffed.

This scene played out time and again as detectives busted 23 men - including a doctor and army reservist - as part of a five-day online sex sting.

Volusia County Sheriff's Office announced yesterday that undercover officers had spent the week posing as children or parents of young children on social networks, chat rooms and other websites in the sting called Operation Volusia Broadband.

The 36-year-old was expecting to find a mother and her 14-year-old daughter who he had arranged to have sex with over the internet.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, he expected the woman  to sign his document, giving him full permission to have sex with the teen.

But when he got to the house he was arrested by law enforcement officers.

The suspects range in age from 18 to 66 years old. The oldest was a 66-year-old semi-retired doctor from Port Orange, John F. Williams.

He arrived at the house with two bottles of wine and Viagra pills, according to the Sentinel.

Job Jesuraju, 19, rode to the home on his bike and even stopped a deputy to ask directions.

A police spokesperson said: 'These individuals thought they were talking to 14-year-olds or younger 
children or the parents who were putting their children up for some kind
of sexual pleasure.'

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office arrested 23 people on Tuesday as part of an undercover sex sting operation named Operation Volusia Broadband

The state attorney told WFTV one suspect even traveled by bicycle to a home in Ormond Beach where investigators were waiting for them

When the conversation moved to meeting a child for sex, undercover officer invited the suspects back to a decoy house where they were arrested.

Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson said: 'Child exploitation is a problem that crosses all jurisdictional boundaries and socioeconomic backgrounds.'

Though most of the men were from Volusia, some of them traveled across the country after arranging to have sex online.
