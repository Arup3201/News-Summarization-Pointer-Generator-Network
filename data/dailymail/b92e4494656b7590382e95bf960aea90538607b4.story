A juror in the Michael Jackson trial has broken her silence to reveal why his private doctor was convicted of killing him.

Debbie Franklin said she and her co-jurors found Dr Conrad Murray guilty for three reasons - he failed to call 911, had no medical backup equipment and left Jackson alone.

The mother-of-two said the jurors were particularly struck by the evidence that the 'king of pop' was still alive when Dr Murray found him.

Speaking out: Debbie Franklin, a juror in the Conrad Murray trial, said jurors found Michael Jackson guilty for three different reasons

She told Good Morning America that if he had the right equipment available the 51-year-old star might have lived.

Asked if Jackson would still be alive, but for Dr Murray, she said: 'Yes. Absolutely.'

She added: 'Conrad Murray did it. Conrad Murray agreed to be the one to 
go into the bedroom and do this. He [Jackson] was looking for somebody 
to say yes, and Conrad Murray said yes.'

Despite this, Ms Franklin said the jury believed Dr Murray did not intentionally mean to kill Jackson.

'We don't think he even had a motive to do this. We think it was 
something that he was doing that was careless that got out of hand.'

Ms Franklin, who was juror number five in the trial, said initially the panel could not reach a verdict after the first day of deliberations.

She said they were split and agreed to spend the weekend thinking about the evidence.

On Monday after further deliberations Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail.

Ms Franklin, a mother of two, said: 'We really did our job. Our hearts were pounding.

'On the first day it wasnâ€™t unanimous, We talked about it and said lets think about over the weekend. It was stressful, there was yelling.'

Ms Franklin, who works as legal assistant, said of Jackson: 'I believe he had issues, he had addictions. He was looking for someone to say yes, and Dr Murray said yes.'

Ms Franklin said Jackson was still alive when Dr Murray returned to his room having been absent to ring his girlfriends.

'When he came back Dr Murray said he was alive. He was not breathing, he had pulse,' she told the TV show.

'At that point he was alive. If he had the medical equipment there, if the airways were blocked, he had nothing.'

Ms Franklin said after nine hours of talking the panel of 12 voted with a show of hands to find Murray guilty.

Each of the jurors wrote their decision on a piece of paper and they returned to the Los Angeles courtroom to deliver the verdict.

Ms Franklin added that she was not surprised to see the 55-year-old doctor led away in handcuffs as he had been found guilty.

'I never gave it a second thought,' she said. 'It didn't bother me.'

She also praised the role of the prosecution team during the trial.

'I thought they did an excellent job. They were ready for every witness. The questioning went from beginning to end. Nothing seemed to sidetrack them.'

Dr Murray could face four years in prison when he is sentenced on November 29.

Ms Franklin said : 'I'm glad I don't have to make that decision.

'I really have no feeling one way or the other what the sentence is. We did our job.'
