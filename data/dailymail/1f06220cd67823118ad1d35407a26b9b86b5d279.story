Employment minister: Esther McVey praised bosses yesterday

The longest pay squeeze in history is finally coming to an end as the jobs market continues to swell.

Last year 1,000 people a day stopped claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, with the number of claimants falling at its fastest rate for 16 years.

The Chancellor yesterday hailed the ‘staggering’ fall of 24 per cent, or 363,200, in 12 months.

He also bragged that for the first time in 35 years, our employment rate is higher than America’s.

The number of workers in Britain has reached 30.2million – the most since records began in 1971.

Nearly half – 14million – are women, including many bread-winning wives as well as those in families who cannot survive on one income.

Employment minister Esther McVey hailed business-owners – and those brave enough to set up a company during the financial crisis – for helping the jobs market to reach such heights.

‘The rise in employment is being fuelled by businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who are feeling increasingly confident with the improving economy,’ she said.

‘They should be congratulated.’

In further good news, pay rises in the private sector are set to beat inflation for the first time following the onset of the financial crisis.

Since 2008, the typical worker’s wage increases have failed to match the rising cost of living, leaving many struggling as energy and food bills spiralled.

But the Office for National Statistics said yesterday that the average private sector worker is now seeing their pay rise by 1.7 per cent – just 0.2 percentage points below the current rate of inflation. 

The squeeze will continue to ease, George Osborne said yesterday, with pay rises set to beat inflation for each of the next five years.

The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that next year wages will rise by 3.2 per cent, compared with inflation of just 2 per cent.

Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the accountants Ernst & Young’s ITEM Club, said: ‘With inflation expected to fall further this year, wage growth will soon outpace price rises and pay packets will go further than before.’ 

Yesterday’s ONS figures also debunked Labour’s claims that the private sector could not create enough jobs for those made redundant by the State.

The private workforce has risen by around 1.4million people since the last general election, while the number of public sector staff has dropped by 360,000. 

Although these figures exclude the impact of ‘reclassifications’ by the ONS, such as moving the newly privatised Royal Mail’s workforce from the public to the private sector, Mr Goodwin said: ‘All in all, it is looking like a broad-based and sustained labour market recovery.’ 

The number of overall job vacancies jumped to 588,000 in February, the largest number since 2008, while unemployment fell by 63,000 between November and January to 2.3million.

Two years ago, nearly six unemployment people were chasing every job vacancy, but today the figure is closer to four. 

The ONS said the record level of employment includes a huge increase in those who are self-employed.

Their ranks have swelled by around 500,000 since the Coalition came to power, reaching a record 4.5million.

Experts say this may not be wholely due to entrepreneurial zeal, however.

They suggest it could simply be that redundant workers have struggled to find well-paid work during the financial crisis, and decided to set up on their own instead.

George Osborne has warned the job is far from done

George Osborne yesterday welcomed the biggest upgrade to Budget growth forecasts for three decades but warned:  ‘The job is far from done.’

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility now expects the economy to grow by 2.7 per cent this year. This would represent the biggest leap for seven years. 

The watchdog also said the economy will surpass its pre-recession peak this summer.

However, Britain is still on course to rack up a deficit of more than £100billion this year, with no surplus expected until 2019.

The national debt is on course to top £1.5trillion, or £60,000 per household, in the coming years and will not start shrinking as a percentage of national income until 2016-17.

‘We set out our plan and together with the British people we held our nerve,’  the Chancellor said.

‘But the job is far from done.’ 

The OBR forecast growth of 2.7 per cent this year, compared with 2.4 per cent in the Autumn Statement in December and 1.8 per cent in the Budget last year.

‘That is the biggest upward revision to growth between Budgets for at least 30 years,’ said Mr Osborne.

‘Later this year the OBR expects Britain to reach the point when our economy is finally larger than before it collapsed six years ago.

'That’s because we’re now growing faster than Germany, faster than Japan, faster than the US. There is no major advanced economy in the world growing faster than Britain today.’ 

Government borrowing fell to around £115billion last year and is expected to edge lower to £107.8billion this year – some £3.4billion less than predicted in December.

The OBR now expects borrowing of £95.5billion in 2014-15, shrinking further every eyar before Britain finally reaches a surplus of £4.8billion in 2018-19.

Mr Osborne had hoped to balance the books by the general election next May, but sluggish economic growth in recent years means austerity will stretch well into the next parliament. 

Andrew Smith, chief economist at KPMG, said: ‘The original strategy was to combine recovery with repair of the public finances over the current Parliament.

'The good news is that we are finally getting the recovery; the bad news is that we are only halfway through what has now become a decade-long deficit reduction programme.’

Ed Miliband said the country faces more austerity because Mr Osborne’s plans have failed.

‘Back in 2010 you told us that by the end of 2014, the economy would have grown by nearly 12 per cent,’ he said.

‘Today the figures say it’s been barely half that, and you want the country to be grateful.’

Unpopular: King John of England

George Osborne had MPs on both sides of the House laughing yesterday with a jibe likening Ed Miliband to England’s notorious medieval ruler King John.

Announcing a grant to help pay for celebrations of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta by the 13th century king, the Chancellor made a series of unflattering comparisons between the ‘weak’ John and the Labour leader.

To cheers from the Tory benches – and laughter from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls – Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘King John’s humbling centuries ago seems unimaginably distant.

‘A weak leader, who had risen to the top after betraying his brother, compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line.

'So I will provide a grant to the Magna Carta Trust to ensure that today’s generation learn the lessons of the past.’ 

It was a thinly-veiled reference to the way Mr Miliband vanquished his older brother David with the help of trade union barons as they fought for the Labour crown in 2010.

The parallels are not exact.

John, the youngest son of Henry II, did attempt to seize control from his older brother Richard the Lionheart, who had been kidnapped during the Crusades and imprisoned in Germany in 1192.

But the attempt was unsuccessful and John was banished when Richard returned to England in 1194.

Unlike the Milibands, however, Richard and John were soon reconciled.

David Miliband, by contrast, has quit as an MP and moved to the United States to avoid becoming part of the ‘soap opera’ surrounding his brother.

John’s reconciliation with his brother allowed him to become king on Richard’s death in 1199.

He ruled until his own death in 1216, signing the Magna Carta in 1215.

He was considered a failure as a king, losing major lands to France and being forced into a humiliating climbdown by the nobility.

Some £20million is being set aside to fund a grant scheme for repairs to cathedrals. 

The funding is timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the First World War, with cathedrals set to play an important role in remembrance services.

The Church of England has warned it faces a £87million repair shortfall in the next  five years.

The Very Rev Vivienne Faull, Dean of York and chairman of the Association of English Cathedrals, welcomed the funding. ‘Whether great or small, cathedrals are part of the lifeblood of their cities,’ she said.
