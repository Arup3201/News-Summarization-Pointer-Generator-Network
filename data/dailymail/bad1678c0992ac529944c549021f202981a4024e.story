Luis Suarez could yet leave Liverpool this summer after it was claimed Carlo Ancelotti has been offered the striker at Real Madrid.

The Uruguayan - who hopes to be fit for this month's World Cup despite a knee injury - is Florentino Perez's top target.

And the Real president has told Ancelotti that he will sanction a move should the manager want him, reports Spanish daily Marca.

Even though they beat city rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, Perez still wants to add more galaticos.

Suarez is one of hottest properties on the continent and was valued at Â£79million by the CIES Football Observatory in an independent study published this week.

Liverpool could stand to make a huge amount on their talisman, although it remains highly unlikely they will be forced into selling.

Suarez was a standout performer for the Reds last season - finishing the Premier League's top scorer and picking up the PFA Player of the Year and Football Writers' awards.

He appears to have settled on Merseyside after a tricky first season in England.

While he was itching to move away last summer, Suarez seemed to be at peace as Brendan Rodgers' side battled to clinch the title and now look forward to a season of European football by virtue of their league finish in May.

Any deal for Suarez wouldn't have an impact on the future of Karim Benzema at the Bernabeu.

The Frenchman is a long-term target for Arsenal but Ancelotti has insisted that he sees him as a key man up front.
