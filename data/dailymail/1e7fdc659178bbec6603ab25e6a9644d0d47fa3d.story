The United States came second in the 2012 Web Index, new research measuring technological access to the web, availability of online content and the social impact of the Internet.

Sweden topped the list, with the UK coming in third. Six of the countries listed in the top 10 ranking were European.

The study, spearheaded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee -- the English computer scientist credited with inventing the world wide web in 1989, is considered a ground-breaking look not only at the technology of the web but also measuring how well a country is allowing its citizens to share information online and ultimately impact society.

Commissioned by the World Wide Web Foundation, the index looked at 61 developed and developing nations, offering the 'first multidimensional measure of the Web's growth, utility and impact.'

With its number one spot, Sweden was found to have the greatest infrastructure to allow citizens to connect to the Internet (with a score of 96.76).

The United States on the other hand was at the top in allowing full access to web content but the availability of the web remained out of reach to some citizens, below its Scandinavian counterpart.

'The U.S. has a lower percentage of households with personal computers than a raft of countries, including Canada, Ireland, Japan and Norway,' according to the study.

The U.S. was also found to be sluggish in terms of internet speed and 'offers slower bandwidth per Internet user than a range of countries, most notably Iceland, Sweden and Singapore.'

While significant usage was reported in the West, the Internet remains out of reach to many living in the developing world.

Less than one in three people use the Internet across the globe, with only one in six people in Africa using the Web.

Nepal, Cameroon and Mali were the 
bottom three of 61 countries measured using indicators such as the 
political, economic and social impact of the web, connectivity and use.

'The high price of connectivity is stopping billions of people from achieving their rights to knowledge and participation. Costs have got to come down dramatically,' Berners-Lee said about the disparity in the availability of internet access.

Sweden is the best country at using the internet, the new report spearheaded by Tim Berners-Lee found.

It was followed by the US and the UK.

Called the Web Index, the first-of-its-kind report ranked 61 countries across seven categories, including communications infrastructure, Web use, Web content and the political, social and economic impact of the Internet in those countries.

Additionally, political repression continues to pose challenges to allowing full access to online content.

'The Web is a global conversation. Growing suppression of free speech, both online and offline, is possibly the single biggest challenge to the future of the Web,' he added.

Berners-Lee has publicly denied the 
web comes with a kill switch, in response to fears governments all over 
the world could coordinate to make it a centralized 
system - particularly after the reliance of activists on the Internet during the Arab Spring uprising.

'The way the internet is
designed is very much as a decentralized system,' the 57-year-old computer scientist said, in speaking about his ground breaking research at the study's release in London on Wednesday at the National Theatre in central London.

'At the moment, because countries 
connect to each other in lots of different ways, there is no one off 
switch, there is no central place where you can turn it off.'

'In
order to be able to turn the whole thing off or really block, suppress 
one particular idea then the countries and governments would have to get
together and agree and co-ordinate and turn it from a decentralised 
system to being a centralized system.'
