La Paz is now officially home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.

The six-mile 'green line' transit system connects the Bolivian capital with its twin city, El Alto.

It is the last of three cable car lines to be installed above the city, which is located 13,600ft, making it one of the world's largest urban cable car systems, with more than six miles of lines, 11 stations and 74 towers in total. 

As of December 4, La Paz, Bolivia, is now home to the highest urban cable car route in the world

On hand to inaugurate the third line of the Mi Teleferico system was President of Bolivia, Evo Morales. 

The latest opening comes after the cable car network launched with a red line in June, carrying more than three million passengers over the past months.

In September, the yellow line opened with 169 cars and four stations in total.

The third line - green, to complete the colours of the Bolivian flag - marks the completion of the first phase of Mi Teleferico.

At the ceremony, President Morales spoke about the modernisation project, made possible due to the country's recent period of economic and political stability. 

According to Tele Sur, Morales said: 'These kinds of large works can only be carried out when there is economic stability.

The city has guaranteed an additional $450 million to the project, which will eventually encompass 5 lines

Though the network had been proposed by previous governments, it had never gotten off the ground

'When there is social stability, this guarantees political stability, and this political stability also guarantees economic stability, including economic growth.

'We have four hundred and fifty million dollars guaranteed for the new five lines of cable cars in La Paz.'

The project, which travels high above the mountainous south side, had been proposed by previous governments but never carried out.

La Paz is officially the highest capital city in the world with altitudes as high as 12,000 feet (3,650 metres) above sea level, where traditional forms of transportation such as trains would be expensive to construct.
