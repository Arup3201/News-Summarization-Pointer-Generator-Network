Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell was coy about whether Calvin Johnson will suit up at Wembley.

The All-Pro receiver has been out with an injury to his right ankle for three weeks but has featured in both practice sessions since the Lions landed in England.

‘I thought he did a pretty good job. We’ll see where he is today,’ Caldwell said.

Caldwell said Johnson had been doing 'a pretty good job' in their recent training sessions

The Lions’ offense has been hit by a raft of injuries with running back Reggie Bush also struggling with an ankle injury.

And three tight ends are also struggling with Joseph Fauria (ankle), Eric Ebron (hamstring) and Brandon Pettigrew (undisclosed) all doubts.

‘It just depends on what happens here in the next day or so. Brandon is the big question mark, 48 hours can make a tremendous difference,’ Caldwell said.

He rated Fauria and Ebron as having ‘a very slim chance’ of playing against the Atlanta Falcons.

The cordial Caldwell was once again complimentary of the Lions base camp at Pennyhill Park, saying the trip to England resembled a training camp atmosphere.

‘A lot of our guys will be sad to leave. It’s been a great week. The way things were organised. Very few difficulties, if any.

‘Our guys have been able to focus. The last couple days of practice our guys have been sharp.’

‘The guys have hung around one another. Working together. Ordinarily a lot of these guys are married and have families. This particular setting allowed those guys to spend some time together and has fostered some cohesion.’
