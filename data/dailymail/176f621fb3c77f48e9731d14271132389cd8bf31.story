Axing thousands of soldiers may have put the country at 'significant risk', the Government's spending watchdog has revealed in a blistering report published today.

The National Audit Office said the decision to cut the army's regular forces from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018, while ramping up the number of reservists, was taken without testing whether it could work. 

It also revealed the plan was running up to six years behind schedule - leaving the army dangerously short of soldiers. The report said the cuts may 'significantly affect the Army's ability to achieve its objectives'.

David Cameron defended the Government's army cuts at Prime Minister's Questions today. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (second right) said the strength of the army reserve was growing for the first time in nearly 20 years

The former head of the Army Lord Dannatt said even if the goal of increasing reservist numbers is met by 2018, there will be at least three years before then when the Army is under strength. He warned that this could leave the country at risk.

He said: 'If it stays relatively quiet and we are not committed anywhere then the risk will not materialise, but if something happens, the strategic shocks happen, and we are terribly bad about spotting them, then we could be embarrassed and we could be in some difficulty.'

Audit office chief Amyas Morse added: 'Army 2020 requires an overall reduction in the size of the Army and a fundamental change to its composition, with a significant reduction in the number of regulars and a substantial increase in the number of trained reserves.

'Military judgment played an important role in decisions but committing to moving towards an Army structure with fewer regular soldiers and an increased number of reserves within the planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility.

'The Department and Army must get a better understanding of significant risks to Army 2020.'

Ministers said the overhaul of the army was needed to save cash - helping the Ministry of Defence save £10.6billion over 10 years.

But the National Audit Office said it could actually end up costing taxpayers more.

Audit office chief Amyas Morse said: 'The planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility.'

He added that the risk of a shortfall in the recruitment of new reserves could 'up the pressure on regular units'.

Labour's Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge said she was 'astounded' that despite the military cuts the cost of army to the taxpayer may actually go up

Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, added: 'The Ministry of Defence focused heavily on cutting costs rather than on recruiting, training and integrating a substantially increased number of reserves, something the Army is already failing to do.'

She added: 'Even after all this, I am astounded to find that reducing the size of the Army will not alone deliver the financial savings required for the MoD budget. 

'Unbelievably, it may even mean increased costs to the Treasury if the reservists are deployed.' 

The Army 2020 re-structuring programme forms part of the package of defence cuts originally set out in the Coalition's 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review.

It will see the regular Army reduced to its lowest level since the time of the Napoleonic Wars.

Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the restructuring plans were 'in danger of collapse'.

He said: 'This devastating report points to a litany of errors and serious failings at the Ministry of Defence under David Cameron.

'Defence ministers were warned that these plans would not work unless they were properly tested and monitored. 

'They were told that front-loading cuts to the Army and back-ending recruitment to the reserves would leave the Armed Forces under strength. They didn't listen and now they're in a complete mess.' 

Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall (left) defended the 'Army 2020' plan to overhaul the service. He said the plan 'will endure' the test of time

General Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff, said: 'The NAO report fails to capture the nature of the austerity we faced at the time these decisions were made.

'The Army has designed a novel and imaginative structure which best meets the challenges we are likely to face within the resources made available.

'Thankfully, most of the structural change for our new model, which we call Army 2020, is now behind us.

'We are recruiting regular and reserve soldiers for this new Army avidly. I am confident that, having made such significant changes, the Army 2020 model will endure.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The MoD has always been clear that the numbers in the Reserves would fall before they increased, but we have now seen the trained strength of the Reserves climb for the first time in nearly 20 years.' 

Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said the Government inherited a reserve that had been 'under-resourced and undervalued for years'.

'We now have a five-year programme for building them up.

'That programme is under way, it is gathering pace. What we are going to see is the strongest possible professional Army with all of the best equipment they could have, and a very strong reserve force backing up, making sure we can meet all of the obligations we set out in the Strategic Defence Review.'
