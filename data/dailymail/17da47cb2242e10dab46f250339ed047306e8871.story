Jose Mourinho has refused to get carried away with Chelsea's table-topping form in the Premier League, despite hailing them as the best club in the country so far this season.

The Blues boss masterminded his side to a 2-0 win away at Stoke on Monday night - a result that sees them move three points clear of second-placed Manchester City.

Seven out of the last 10 teams who have led the Premier League on Christmas day have gone onto win the title - but Mourinho isn't looking past the club's festive fixture list.

'I don't think it's important what you did in past [Mourinho won successive titles with Chelsea in 2005 and 2006 after they topped the table at Christmas in both seasons]' he said in his post-match interview on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show

But this season though, in my opinion, we we're the best side today because we're top.

'We start this Christmas period with the hardest set of fixtures in comparison to our rivals. Coming up we have difficult away games [at Southampton and Tottenham] and next face West Ham [on Boxing Day] at home who are playing well.

'Today [Monday] was a fantastic performance. It's one of those games where victory means more than three points. You feel the atmosphere, the spirit in the team as they aim to win the title.'

Chelsea captain John Terry and midfielder Nemanja Matic both echoed their manager's sentiments post-match too.

Terry, who scored their opener at the Britannia Stadium, believes the title is a three-horse race between themseleves, City and Manchester United.

Asked if he feels Chelsea are on course to win only the club's third Premier League title in their history, the 34-year-old said: 'No if you look at City they've come from nowhere and United are back in fold too. All it takes is a run of games from either side to overcome us.

'There's a long way to go and we've got West Ham next - who were a tough opponent for us last season [the sides drew 0-0 in the corresponding fixutre at Stamford Bridge last term]. It's a cliche but we're taking it game by game.

Matic added: 'It's very important to be first as it means we depend on ourselves now for results. City are only three points behind us and United are 10 - anything can happen until the end [of the season] so we have to keep concentrating.'
