Killer grandmother: Miyoko Sumida, 64, the main suspect behind a series of mysterious deaths in Japan, who killed herself today

A Japanese grandmother who allegedly orchestrated the murders of six members of her family so she could make money from insurance claims has killed herself.

Miyoko Sumida, 64, the primary suspect behind a series of mysterious deaths in Amagasaki, Japan, took her own life while she was in a holding cell, it was reported today.

Despite being on suicide watch it appears as though she choked herself and her body was found in the early hours of this morning.

She was taken to hospital where she was confirmed dead.

Sumida was the central figure in an investigation into the multiple deaths of people she was related to, or acquainted with, while she was also suspected of killing her husband to claim insurance.

Six other people, including her sister-in-law and daughter-in-law, dubbed 'The Piranha Family' have been in custody since November in connection with the case.

Six bodies were found in steel drums or wrapped 
in blankets and hidden beneath floorboards of family properties.

Police said she told investigators she was to blame for everything.

The grandmother was arrested following a
tip off to police that a number of people who had visited her luxurious 
penthouse apartment in Amagasaki had subsequently disappeared.

Sumida was charged with the murder of a 66-year-old woman, Kazuko Oe, whose body was found in November 2011 in a concrete-filled metal drum in a warehouse in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture, the Japan Times reported.

She was served with a fresh arrest warrant last month on suspicion of 
killing Jiro Hashimoto, 53, one her distant relatives, after his body, encased in concrete and also inside a steel drum, was pulled from a harbor in Okayama Prefecture.

New charges were filed against a group of suspects on December 5th for Hashimoto’s confinement and murder.

Sumida was also under investigation for her suspected role in a series of other deaths.

Police sources told the Japan Times that Sumida was found this morning in her cell after choking herself.

According to police, she was 
confirmed to have been dozing in her cell until around 6am but ten 
minutes later she was found to have stopped breathing.

She was immediately taken to a hospital, where she was confirmed dead, the police officials said.

In
October, police discovered the partly mummified remains of three 
corpses beneath the home of the 88-year-old grandmother of Mrs Sumida’s 
daughter-in-law.

One of the bodies was identified as Mitsue Ando, 71, the partner of Mrs Sumida’s older brother.

The other two were Mariko Nakashima, the 29-year-old older sister of Mrs Sumida’s daughter-in-law, and 68-year-old Takashi Tanimoto, whose elder brother was a friend of Mrs Sumida.

An investigation into the killings was also widened to look into the death in 2005 of Mrs Sumida’s husband during a holiday in Okinawa.

He was part of a group of nine people having their photo taken
on top of a cliff when he fell. The family received Y90million (£705,218) in insurance and had a property mortgage written off.

Police are investigating suggestions from people who were present that the man was coerced into committing suicide, Asia One reported.

Other victims had reportedly loaned 
money to Sumida or had left property or other assets to her. In police interviews, Sumida’s relatives
said they lived in an apartment with her in Amagasaki last year.

They said they 
were forced to assault Hashimoto and then lock him in a shed on the 
balcony for several days until he died. The police reportedly believe Sumida intentionally made sure he died from neglect.

According to the police, on October 22, Sumida said to an officer in charge of managing the detention facility in which she was being held: 'I want to die. How can I kill myself'.

She also hinted she wanted to commit suicide on three different occasions, according to the Japan Times. The incidents prompted officers to put her on suicide watch.

Sumida's lawyer, Hajime Takagi, told reporters today that Sumida had told him it was meaningless to continue living.

He said she told him: 'I won't be able to see my family. I have something I want you to convey (to them).'

Takagi last saw Sumida on Tuesday evening. At that time, she stood up and bowed to thank him, he said.

Police are also investigating two more suspicious deaths, including that of her daughter-in-law's 88-year-old grandmother.
