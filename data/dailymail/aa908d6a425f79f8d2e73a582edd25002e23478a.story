The husband of a GP who has gone missing while suffering the symptoms of post-natal depression has begged his ‘amazing’ wife to get in touch.

Dr Elizabeth Kinston, 37, who was suffering from ‘worry’ and ‘anxiety’ after the birth of her daughter, Elsie, has been missing for a week.

Her husband David, 36, has made an emotional plea for the mother-of-two – known as Lizzie – to let him know she is safe.

Disappeared: Dr Elizabeth Kinston walked past the Vat and Fiddle pub, in Queensbridge Road, Nottingham, at 11.43am on Friday. She has not been seen since

Detective Inspector Kev Broadhead, of Nottinghamshire police, said: 'Elizabeth has never left her family like this before'

Speaking yesterday from their home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, Mr Kinston said his wife had shown ‘no warning signs’ before she disappeared.

GP and mother-of-two Elizabeth Kinston, 37, has been missing from her home in Beeston since Friday and her husband David, 36, has begged her to come home

But he added that she had been worried and anxious after the birth of their second child.

‘She’s not been diagnosed with post-natal depression as yet, that’s just what the symptoms show.’ The civil engineer said: ‘Lizzie, I miss you, the girls miss you. It’s so hard without you here. We need you. If you want more time, that’s okay. But please call me – or call your mum and dad or your sister, who are all so worried about you too – just so we know you are all right.’

He described her as ‘such a caring person, an amazing mum and wife’, adding: ‘She’s everything to me.’

Dr Kinston’s sister, Charlotte Naaman, said: ‘There’s a pattern leading up to it. Just worry, anxiety, but we never thought things were this bad that Liz would just take off.’

She said the couple’s daughters – Elsie, ten months, and Sophia, three – were with their grandparents. ‘They don’t know anything about this.’

CCTV pictures show Dr  Kinston walking past the Vat And Fiddle pub in Nottingham city centre at 11.45am on Friday – an hour after leaving home.

She was spotted in her Audi soon after at a petrol station and later at a car park in  Nottingham. Her car was found there the following day, with her purse and phone inside.

Dr Kinston was on maternity leave from her job as a GP after the birth of Elsie in January. She was recently treated for anxiety and had a doctor’s appointment, which she failed to keep, last Friday.

Co-founder of Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support, Rachel Dobson, last night said the organisation was being contacted by ‘more and more healthcare professionals’.

One theory is that Dr Kinston boarded a train, but this footage raises the possibility she walked past the station

Dr Kinston's husband made an emotional appeal for his wife to let him know she is safe

‘Unfortunately they feel there is still a lot of stigma within the NHS, in that they are not able to ask for help and because there is not that help available,’ she said.

Detective Inspector Kev Broadhead, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘We are aware that Elizabeth has been  battling post-natal depression.

‘That fact, along with our belief that she has little money, no bank cards and no phone with her is of great concern. The cold weather is an added worry.’

Dr Kinston is described as white, 5ft 7in tall and of medium build. She has blonde, shoulder-length hair, which was tied back in a ponytail.

The day she went missing, she was wearing a dark green quilted coat with a fur hood, a light pink pullover, blue jeans and dark brown knee-high riding-style boots. Detectives hope the distinctive jumper could be the key to finding her. It has the outline of a chicken pecking at a cup on the back.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
