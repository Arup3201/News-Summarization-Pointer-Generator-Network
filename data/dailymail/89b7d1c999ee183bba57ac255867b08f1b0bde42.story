Louis van Gaal believes his appointment as manager of Manchester United has helped take his mind off the pressing business of a World Cup with Holland.

Van Gaal’s team take on Spain in a mouth-watering Group B game in Salvador on Friday, a repeat of the 2010 final won by the Spaniards.

But with the 62-year-old about to take over at Old Trafford after the tournament, he claimed tonight that his imminent move to England has not hindered his World Cup preparation.

Asked if the United job would prove a distraction to Holland's chances in Brazil, Van Gaal said: 'The question about Manchester United? There is a time and a place. I don't think this is the place.

'The World Cup is a championship and clubs don't take part in this, so I am fully focused on the national team.

'Distraction? It may be a distraction but, for instance, the players - when was it? - on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, I gave them some time off, just to get out there.

'You can't just focus monotonously on the World Cup, so perhaps Manchester United was a good distraction. You can't be fully focused on football for five weeks.'

Van Gaal was not coach of Holland when they tried to kick Spain off the pitch in losing 1-0 at Soccer City, Johannesburg, four years ago.

But on Thursday he defended the rough house tactics of Bert van Marwijk’s team.

'I believe that physical resistance is part and parcel of football,' said van Gaal. 'There is a referee that will point out what the limits are and I think the team four years ago did not cross the line.'It is obvious you have a different opinion, which is a shame. I think the physical struggle is part of football. It is part of sport. If you watch our training sessions you can see it for yourself, in the structure and process we have.'
