Theory: Detectives are investigating whether the gun used to kill two policewomen in Greater Manchester was smuggled into Britain by Steven Greenoe (pictured)

Lethal grenades like the one used in the attack which killed two policewomen are changing hands for as little as £50 on Britain's streets, it was claimed today.

Criminals can get hold of the weapons with relative ease as they are smuggled into the UK from countries such as Afghanistan, underworld sources say.

The claims were made as it emerged that the gun used to kill PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, could have been brought into Britain from the US.

Police are investigating whether a 
gun recovered from the scene was one of more than 60 smuggled into the 
country from a former US marine who once worked as a bodyguard for pop 
star Madonna.

The
policewomen were killed in a gun and grenade attack on Tuesday as they 
went to investigate a report of a burglary in Hattersley, Tameside, 
Greater Manchester.

The killings followed a series of attacks linked to gangland rivalries in the Greater Manchester area.

'These
grenades are out there and if you know the right people you can pick 
them up for as little as £50,' a gangster told the Manchester Evening 
News.

An unnamed police officer added: 'There’s a real concern that there’s a fair amount of these things out there.'

It
has been suggested that the most commonly used devices are the 
Swiss-maufactured British Army issue L109 and the Yugoslavian-made M75.

are investigating whether a gun used in the attack on PC Bone and PC 
Nicola Hughes was among the weapons smuggled into Britain by Steven 
Greenoe.

Mail
Online reported in January how the 38-year-old former US marine, of 
Raleigh, North Carolina, bought weapons from American gun shops, broke 
them down to their component parts and then brought them into the UK in 
his luggage on commercial flights.

Grenades are reportedly being sold for as little as £50 as the weapons are smuggled into the UK

A court in the US was told that Greenoe, who former bodygaurd for Madonna, smuggled 63 pistols on nine trips to the UK between February and July 2010.

The weapons were all brought in through Manchester Airport, and a number have been linked to shootings in Greater Manchester and Merseyside.

Greenoe was jailed for 10 years.

Tuesday's killings have shocked police officers, many of whom are unaccustomed to grenade attacks in Britain.

David Anthony, a former chief superintendent at Greater Manchester Police, told Sky News: 'I have never in 31 years' police service come across a criminal incident where hand grenades are used?'

He said police would be trying to trace the origin of the grenade, whether it had come from the Army, had been imported from abroad or was possibly home-made.

The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, dismissed suggestions that grenades were ‘common currency’.

He said: 'Clearly, part of the unusual nature of this case is that we have not, to my knowledge, recovered hand grenades before and hand grenades have not been used in this way.

'It certainly doesn’t indicate that they are common currency. However, there’s always concern that various sorts of weapons can come in from other parts of the world.'

Attacks involving grenades are rare. One was left on the wall of former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish’s home in Southport in July 2009.

It is thought the intended target was not Dalglish and the device had been planted by a criminal gang.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
