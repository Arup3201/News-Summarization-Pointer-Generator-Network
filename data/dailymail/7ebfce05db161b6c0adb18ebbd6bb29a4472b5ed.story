A British tourist has died after apparently taking cocaine and heroin on a trip to Amsterdam.

Joel McDevitt, 22, was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city, but discharged himself before he was treated. 

Officers later found him nearby and took him to a police station, where he had to be resuscitated.

He was then taken back to hospital, but died there on October 26.

'Such a top bloke': Joel McDevitt died after taking a 'quantity of drugs' with a friend on a trip to Amsterdam

Officers believe he and an unnamed friend, both from Burnley, Lancashire, had 'taken a quantity of drugs' including cocaine and heroin.

The second man remained in hospital in the city yesterday.

Both men were found near a canal by police and were taken to different hospitals in the city. 

A spokesman for Amsterdam Police said: 'It is believed the man who died and the other man, who is still in hospital and also had to be resuscitated, had taken a quantity of drugs. 

'An investigation is under way.

'Because the man who died had been in the care of the police, a state investigation has also been launched.'

Mr McDevitt's death is the second tragedy to hit his family, with his older brother Wesley passing away aged 18 after falling from a minibus in Bury in 2004.

The former Burnley College student, and his friend were found near the Reguliersgracht canal, in the centre of the capital city, which is famous for its museums, nightlife and music.

Tragedy: Mr McDevitt was taken to a hospital after being found by a canal, but discharged himself before he was treated. Police later discovered him nearby and took him to a police station where he was resuscitated 

The police spokesman added: 'The men were taken by ambulance to two different hospitals. One discharged himself and left the hospital of his own free will.

'The police were informed and found the man nearby. They advised him to go back to the hospital because he had not yet been treated.

'The man refused and wanted to go to a car that was parked near the arena. The car was never found.

'The police then took him to their office. The man was given the opportunity to lie down on a mattress in a room.

'His condition was monitored. At one point, the officers had to resuscitate the man. 

'Paramedics arrived and took over the resuscitation. The man was then taken to hospital where he died.'

According to news website nu.nl local police denied that Mr McDevitt's death was connected to the those of four people at the Amsterdam Dance Event last week.

A police spokesman told the website: 'They died after taking pills. These men had taken something else. They had probably taken cocaine and heroin.'

Tributes for Mr McDevitt and his brother and messages of support for their family, who are being supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, were posted on social media.

Séan Metcalfe said: 'Such a shame both top lads. I hope their parents may find peace.'

Danny 'Fozzi' Foster wrote: 'Such a top bloke. Love you pal, rest in peace..'

And Kyle Fleming added: 'Sure you'll both look after each other up there. Gone but not forgotten. Rest in peace lads.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed they were providing support to Mr McDevitt's relatives.

He said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in the Netherlands on October 26.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
