Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County

An East Tennessee pastor who has appeared on a reality television show about handling snakes in church faces charges of assault and reckless endangerment.

Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County.

No-one was injured.

Elizabeth Hamblin told officers that as she was leaving a park with her four children and Jeremy Henegar, Andrew Hamblin got behind them, and pointed a handgun from his vehicle, reports Knox News.

The warrant does not specify the relationship between Henegar and Elizabeth Hamblin, but it states the two share the Hickory Hills residence.

Elizabeth Hamblin said that when she arrived home Hamblin pulled up in front of their residence and waved a handgun before he fired a shot in the air.

She claims he then pointed a gun at Henegar and fired a second time, missing Henegar and striking the residence, before fleeing. 

Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time.

Investigators recovered a bullet that was fired into the residence.  

Hamblin is the pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, which uses snake handling in services.

He has appeared on the reality show 'Snake Salvation' on the National Geographic Channel. 

Hamblin was due in court for arraignment Monday. 

It wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney to reach for comment.

In 2013, state wildlife officials seized 53 copper heads and rattlesnakes from Hamblin and cited him for illegally keeping them, but a grand jury declined to indict him. 

In 2014 Hamblin and his worshipers were evicted from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing. 

Clyde Daugherty, who built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants. 

'Too many people were getting hurt and dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told

'He was focused too much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show, instead of the word of God.'

Hamblin's Pentecostal church practices a rare, century-old Christian tradition of worshiping God with venomous snakes such as timber rattlers, cottonmouths and copperheads, according to Urban Christian News. 

About 125 such churches exist in the U.S.

Pastors use the snakes to show non-Christians that God protects them from harm, holding them aloft as they pray, sing and dance.

The belief stems from a literal reading of Jesus' words in the Gospel of Mark: 'And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.' 

Hamblin's mentor, fellow reality TV star and snake-wielding pastor Jamie Coots, died in February 2014 after being bitten at his church in Middlesboro, Kentucky. 

His son Cody, 21, took over for him and was also bitten by a snake.
