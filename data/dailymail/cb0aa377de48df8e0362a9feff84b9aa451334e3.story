He's the colourful identity and former bikie associate who was left bleeding to death three years ago on an affluent Sydney street after being stabbed nine times in broad daylight.

Now, Kings Cross party boy Mark James Judge has taken time away from Sydney and changed his name to continue his love of nightlife across the globe.

The 34-year-old former Rebels bikie associate has dropped his surname on his social media profile and now calls himself Mark James as he jet sets around Europe and Africa with his girlfriend Claire Thompson.

Judge, who is a regular on the Sydney party scene, first catapulted into the public limelight in 2009 after a bizarre episode with former Home & Away actress Jodi Gordon, who is now the wife of NRL star Braith Anasta.

The pair, who met that night at a bar in Kings Cross, were found by police huddled in the bedroom of his Bellevue Hill home after they sparked an emergency operation after claiming to see armed men on CCTV cameras trying to break in.

The well-known ladies' man was found bleeding to death on an upmarket Sydney street after he was violently stabbed nine times in 2011. He was found collapsed on the footpath outside his apartment by two friends who were driving past after the attack.

Judge, who grew up near Penrith in western Sydney, started out as a doorman for a Rebels clubhouse. He never joined the club and instead chose to remain an associate.

The colourful character and his girlfriend, who are believed to have been dating since at least 2012, have uploaded a number of photos to social media over the past five months capturing their lavish trip.

The most recent photos show the couple posing together in Greece and Turkey showing off their trim and tattooed bodies.

Judge admitted in court three years ago to amphetamine and steroid use in the past but his lawyer said he had been clean for several years. 

He was spared a full time jail sentence in 2005 after pleading guilty to bashing a furniture store owner and using a brick to crush the man's finger when he tried to reclaim some of the $70,000 he had lent him.

Judge, who counts Kings Cross nightclub owner John Ibrahim as a friend, was among the first to be banned from the notorious nightclub strip for alleged bad behaviour alongside former NRL player John Hopoate in 2013. The bans were subsequently overturned on appeal.

Judge, pictured here leaving court, was acquitted late last year of assault charges relating to a bloody brawl involving four people near Kings Cross police station on July 21, 2013

He was acquitted late last year of four assault charges relating to a bloody brawl involving four people near Kings Cross police station on July 21, 2013.

Judge, who runs a luxury watch shop in Bondi Junction, offered a large reward for the return of his after his pet macaw, reportedly worth $10,000, when it went missing last year.

His friend John Ibrahim's macaw had escaped from his multimillion-dollar Sydney home the year before.
