Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee says he's 'stunned and dismayed' to learn that DNA tests revealed he is not the father of a woman he thought was his daughter.

Cohen made the remarks after CNN had a paternity test done on 25-year-old Texas model Victoria Brink with Cohen’s participation, which revealed that John Brink - the man who raised her and the ex-husband to her mother - is in fact her father.

To John Brink's surprise, Cohen had stated in February that he was Victoria Brink's father, after Twitter messages he sent to her raised questions about their relationship. Cohen said he discovered she was his daughter three years earlier when he Googled a former lover, Cynthia Sinatra, and learned she had a daughter.

'I knew her mother a long time ago,' Cohen told CNN. 'I Googled her one night, and saw that she had given birth to a beautiful young lady, and I kind of went back to nine months before, and that was a time when we were involved.'

Who are you Tweeting? Congressman Steve Cohen was seen sending a Tweet during the State of the Union in February (left) and the recipient was Ashley Brink (right) who he later revealed is his daughter. Now new DNA tests show she isn't, in fact, his daughter

Unintended audience: Though he meant to send it as a direct message, he sent it to his 6,000 followers and deleted it shortly after

John Brink, the president of Houston-based Environment and Energy Group, told Politico that Cohen's claims of paternity 'rocked' his world.

In a tweet that Cohen had sent to Victoria Brink in February during the president's State of the Union speech, he  wrote, 'Happy Valentine's beautiful girl.' He ended the message by writing 'ilu,' which is short for 'I love you'.

Cohen said Thursday said he still loves Brink and hopes to remain in her life, though he was 'stunned and dismayed when DNA tests disproved what Victoria and I believed about our relationship.'

Back in February, Cohen had initially claimed that the model that he was tweeting during the televised speech was a family friend.

But that didn't silence critics who thought it odd that the ended the message by writing 'ilu.'

The congressman later admitted Brink was his daughter from a previous relationship.

She
had not publicly admitted that he was her father, but the two have 
grown close since Cohen contacted her mother - his former flame - for 
unspecified reasons.

'When she let me know she was watching the State of the Union address I was thrilled that she wanted Steve Cohen to be part of her. I had such joy, that I couldn’t hold back from tweeting her,' he told NBC's Luke Russert.

The 63-year-old, three-term Congressman 
said that he only discovered that he had fathered the young woman only 
when he did a Google search of her mother and found out that she had a daughter.

He contacted her after realizing that the 'math looked pretty accurate'.

'The mom told me we had a lot of catching up to do,' he told NBC.

Cohen said that the mother confirmed that he was the father, saying that she sees physical similarities between the two.

The mother said: 'Every time I look at her I see the German Jew in her face.'

Cohen told NBC: 'I’m Lithuanian- close enough.'

Cohen's heritage is a proud point for the politician, as he is the first Jewish congressman from Tennessee.

From there, he began to build a relationship with Ms Brink, taking her on a tour of the Capitol and White House.

Daughter: Little is known about Victoria Brink except that she is a 24-year-old model

He went on to share a picture from the White House Christmas party with NBC reporter Luke Russert, who said via Twitter that during their interview 'Cohen was emotional while telling the story about his daughter, fought back tears, could feel genuine fatherly emotion.'

While the emotional reunion likely silences political watchers, it doesn't necessarily quiet his constituents who take issue with the fact he was tweeting at all.

'That goes to show you he had his mind on other things except the State of the Union,' Jerome Holloway from Memphis told local news station WMCTV.

'Everybody carries a phone but it should have been off for something that important.'
