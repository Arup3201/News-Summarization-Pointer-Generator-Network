A massively obese dachshund has lost 50 pounds after having a tummy tuck - and gone on to release an inspirational weight loss calendar. 

Two years ago, Obie tipped the scales at 5st 7lbs and even needed to wear a special harness to prevent injury to his bulging belly.

But after being adopted by former veterinary technician Nora Vanatta in August 2012, he was put on a strict diet and exercise regimen.

Obie's story went viral last year when social media was flooded with pictures of the grossly obese and miserable-looking dachshund. At his heaviest, he tipped the scales at 5st 7lbs

After some hard work and surgery to remove excess skin, the seven-year-old now weighs a healthy 1st 9lbs. Pictured, his calendar page for September

After some hard work and surgery to remove his excess skin, the seven-year-old now weighs a healthy 1st 9lbs.

Obie's new owner has now released an inspirational calendar for 2015 to help motivate other overweight pets to shed their extra pounds.

Ms Vanatta, from Portland, Oregon, said: 'I feel blessed to be involved in Obie's rehab and hope he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight.

'It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible.' 

Dachshunds normally weigh 32lbs, but at 77lbs, a five-year-old Obie weighed more than twice that and was dubbed the World's Fattest Sausage Dog. 

Before he was adopted by Ms Vanatta, he had been cared for by an elderly couple who fed him whatever he wanted and couldn't exercise due to their ill health.

He had to wear a special harness to stop his stomach rubbing against the floor, leading to painful chaffing.

Ms Vanatta, who has a degree in Animal Science, added: 'He was obviously loved and his elderly owners just couldn't say no to those big brown eyes. 

'I was thrilled to be able to help him with his new life.

'Now I want his journey to inspire other big animals and maybe even their owners to get healthy in the new year.'

After he was adopted, she put him on a strict diet to lose some of his belly before walking him on a treadmill and taking him for a swim. 

After losing 40lbs, he had to have cosmetic surgery to remove several pounds of excess skin.

Recently, it emerged that Ms Vanatta was investigated by the charitable activities section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office.

It was reported that in order to get her pet down to his target weight, she appealed for donations.

The money donated online funded specialty diet food for Obie, skin-reduction surgery, an exercise regime and legal bills to fight off a custody battle.

She wrote on Facebook in September: 'Recently, someone filed a complaint with the Oregon State Attorney General's office because I accepted financial gifts on Obie's behalf.

'The Oregon AG contends that, by stating publicly that I would donate the funds over and above Obie's medical needs and the custody suit to recognized 501(c)3 organizations, I misrepresented myself as a charity and misled the folks who supported Obie with financial gifts.  

'This, the AG further contends, is proven by the reference to said gifts as "donations."

'This saddens me more than I can adequately express.' 

And soon after Ms Vanatta adopted Obie, he became the subject of a bitter custody battle with the Oregon Dachshund Rescue – the agency that coordinated with Vanatta to transfer Obie from the relative's custody to her home.

They accused her of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and began fighting for custody.  

She detailed on Facebook how the lawsuit was settled after four months but 'unfortunately, the settlement came at a price: over $15K of Obie's money was used to fight a frivolous lawsuit.'

She added: 'The bottom line: the Oregon AG conceded that no wrong doing was found and I may keep a small amount of your gifts to put toward Obie’s future care, but the balance is to be either sent to the State, or to recognized charities that they approve.' 

It was reported the Attorney General began looking into the matter after receiving complaints.

The story of grossly Obie went viral last year when social media sites were flooded with photos of the miserable-looking dachshund lying on his back with his enormous belly chaffed from being dragged on the ground.

After losing almost four stone, Obie has released a weight loss calendar. Pictured, the  page for February features a collage of the dachshund with his owner Nora Vanatta
