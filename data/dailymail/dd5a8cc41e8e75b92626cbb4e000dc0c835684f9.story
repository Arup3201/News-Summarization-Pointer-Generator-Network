Manchester United will listen to loan offers for rookie defender Tyler Blackett this week.

And the 20-year-old will also be considered for a season-long loan away from Old Trafford next season.

Blackett has made the breakthrough into the United first-team this campaign, making 10 appearances for the club.

His performances even earned him a new two-year contract.

But the youngster hasn't played since the 1-0 home defeat to Southampton on January 11.

There is a belief among some coaches at Old Trafford that Blackett needs to toughen up before he can be considered as regular for Louis van Gaal's side.

And United could send the Blackett on loan to the Championship before Thursday's Football League loan deadline to give him vital senior experience.

Likewise, Blackett is set for a loan switch away ahead of the start of next season as they look to groom him for United's first team.
