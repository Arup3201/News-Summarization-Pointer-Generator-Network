A 60-year-old doomsday survivalist has been convicted of stealing $400,000 in coins from his employer to build a massive off-the-grid home to prepare for the world's end.

Alaska's Steven D. Berry funded the three-story home - which boasts a gym, hot tub, secret passageways and a Gatling gun on a swivel mount loaded 
with a belt of bullets - by raiding the coin vaults of a local car wash.

Berry, who still reportedly lives in the Bald Mountain house, will be sentenced in December.

Thief: Doomsday survivalist Steve Berry, 60, is accused of building an off-the-grid home by stealing $400,000 in coins from his employer, Mudbusters Car Wash

Alaska Dispatch reported the trouble began in 2009 at Wasilla car wash, Mudbusters, from which Berry had recently been fired.

Employee Paul Montanez, 20, told his boss, Mudbusters co-owner Karen Mahoy, he had seen Berry twice lug five-gallon buckets full of quarters to the Alaska USA Federal Credit Union.

Berry allegedly told Montanez he was depositing money for Mudbusters, however the business did not use that bank.

Karen Mahoy and her husband Stephen Mahoy had already suspected Berry had been raiding the company coin vaults for years and was taking home $1,000 bricks of dollar coins from the bank.

Within nine months of Berry leaving, the company took in an extra $30,000.

'That
was the first red flag,' Karen Mahoy said. 'We were suddenly buying a 
lot less dollar coins from the bank and depositing a lot more money.'

Berry's former wife, Tasha Buxton, also believes Berry is still hiding a small fortune in coins or cash, according to Alaska Dispatch.

Buxton, 41, helped turned Berry in once she realized what he'd done.

It was revealed at trial that Berry buried jars of money because he couldn't trust banks and had hidden $30,000 when he moved, penniless, from Maine to Alaska in 1999.

While Berry only earned about $50,000 a year as a manager at Mudbusters, he had a big house, a time-share in Las Vegas, a pair of snow machines, a four-wheeler and numerous cars.

Berry also spent a fortune renovating his home, constructing a secret room behind the master bedroom closet that contained food, water and ammunition, as well as more than 20 guns.

Buxton said his collection included a $4,000 semiautomatic Gatling gun, part of more than $13,000 in items once purchased at a garage sale.

From the escape room, a ladder into the attic ultimately provided access to the living room closet.

An escape chute allowed someone to drop onto a fuel tank in the basement.

Buxton also said the house hid $100,000 in coins, but ultimately, only $50,000 worth of change ended up in the basement wall, hidden behind plastic sheeting, foam insulation and shelving.

While Buxton thought it strange her 
husband stockpiled his savings in coins, she didn't think it out of step
with an 'end-of-the-worlder' paranoid character.

However she saw things differently when the Mahoys accused Berry of stealing.

'Once
I realize there's $100,000 hidden and movement toward a civil case 
saying he'd stolen more than $400,000, that's when I really started 
questioning his stories,' Buxton said.

Affidavit
Investigator Ruthan Josten said in November 2011 that she obtained a 
warrant to search Berry’s home, which she described as a half-million 
dollar home run on batteries, a generator and solar power.

'A
large amount of U.S. Mint coins were found as well as coin counters. I 
found a receipt that showed he recently spent $14,000 at a garage sale,'
Josten said, according to Mat Su Valley Frontiersman. 

'[Buxton]
showed me a secret room in the house that contained life essentials, a 
place to sleep and an ‘excape chute’ that went to the basement.'

She
also told Josten that he’d hid $1,000 in the wall but removed it after 
their relationship fell apart and both filed domestic violence 
restraining orders on each other.

At
trial, according to the log notes, Berry maintained that the $500,000 
price tag on the home was only its insured value and that he built it 
out of pocket.

On September 6, a jury in Palmer found
Berry guilty of first-degree theft of more than $25,000, a Class B 
felony and the state's most severe theft charge.

A
forensic accountant, who examined years of car wash records and Berry's
bank accounts, testified the car wash had lost at least $414,750 between
2001 and early 2009.

The
charge carries up to 10 years in prison, according to Alaska law. The sentence is set to be decided at a December 16 hearing.
