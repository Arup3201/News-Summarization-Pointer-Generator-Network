Fighting for life: Connor Lynes was found collapsed on his bedroom floor morning after his rugby match

A 14-year-old boy was today fighting for his life after suffering a blood clot on his brain when he was injured playing rugby.

Connor Lynes, of Hull, East Yorkshire, returned home after playing for his under-15s rugby league team on Saturday - but was found collapsed on his bedroom floor the next morning.

After being taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, Connor was put in an induced coma and doctors removed 90 per cent of the clot - in a potentially life-saving operation.

He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary on Sunday, where he underwent another operation yesterday to try to remove the rest. Now, he may face a third surgery.

His family are now asking people to pray for ‘little Robin’, who plays for Lambwath Lions.

Connor’s uncle Dave Lynes said: ‘We want people to pray for Connor and keep their fingers crossed. We still do not know if he will pull through. It is just heartbreaking at the moment.

‘He is a cheeky little lad and he is full of mischief. He has got a heart of gold, has lots and lots of friends and is very popular at school, at his club and at Hull Kingston Rovers.’

Mr Lynes said Connor, who lives with his aunt, Sara, was injured after being tackled.

He added: ‘Connor was playing rugby for his local under-15s team and took a bit of a hard hit in the tackle. They took him off straight away but he seemed fine. 

'He was at home on Saturday night being his usual cheeky self. My sister got up the next morning and found him collapsed on the bedroom floor and rushed him to hospital.'

Mr Lynes said it was tough for relatives to see Connor, a pupil at Winifred Holtby Academy, in hospital, adding that the family are 'totally powerless at the moment'.

He said: ‘He has had such a hard life – he lost his father when he was young but is still such a cheeky lad. He is not just my nephew, but he is like a son to me as well.’

Mr Lynes said Connor loves rugby and is a huge fan of Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers.

He added: 'Connor broke his leg four years ago and the doctors said he would never play rugby again. It was bad - he broke his tibia and fibula - but a year later, he was playing again.

'He loves the sport and is a massive rugby fan. He is a KR fan and I am a Hull fan and we have a lot of banter between us about it.’

Mr Lynes said: ‘Connor did come out the coma last night and is breathing unaided. He's opened his eyes and even managed a cheeky smile.’

Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of Connor’s family, Steve Ball, general manager of the Rugby and Football League Benevolent Fund, said he had visited the youngster at Leeds General Infirmary. 

The boy is still ‘very poorly’ but in a stable condition while relatives keep a vigil around his hospital bed.

Mr Ball said today: ‘Thankfully he is conscious now and aware of his surroundings. He saw me and was able to give me a thumbs up. He may need to undergo a further surgery and we will find out in the next few days.’

He said that Connor had been playing in a group match for Lambwath Lions against another East Yorkshire team from Beverley.

Mr Ball added: ‘It was a perfectly legitimate tackle and a freak accident really. He didn’t actually fall ill until the day after the match.’

Meanwhile, a Hull Kingston Rovers spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with young Connor Lynes, who is in intensive care following an injury playing the sport he loves yesterday. Get well soon Connor, from everyone at the club.'
