Wesley Sneijder showed Manchester United what they're missing by scoring two stunning goals for Galatasaray on Thursday night.

The 30-year-old midfielder was a target for the Red Devils and Premier League rivals Southampton during the January transfer window.

And how United manager Louis van Gaal could do with the magic touch of Sneijder to help spark his misfiring side as they chase a top four finish in the Premier League.

Sneijder's first goal was a 25-yard rocket which flew past the stranded goalkeeper in the first half.

And he followed it with a delightful chip which floated into the top corner as Galatasaray secured a 4-1 victory over Konyaspor in the Turkish Cup.
