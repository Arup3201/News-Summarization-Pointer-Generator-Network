Australia's hottest property market looks set to continue to boom after a cut in mortgage interest rates on Tuesday saw the auction clearance rate jump to 82 per cent in Sydney this weekend.

The cut, which means potential savings of $60 a month on a $400,000 mortgage, has also sent prices soaring with buyers having more cash in their budget to use for bidding at auction.

In Sydney 82 per cent of the 256 properties listed for auction on Saturday sold under the hammer on that same day, the Domain Group reported.

On the same weekend last year the clearance rate was just 78 per cent.

Steven Duong, of Ray White Lidcombe, told Daily Mail Australia that he has seen a surge of interest since the mortgage rate cuts.

'There are a lot more buyers and new buyers compared to last year and people are willing to spend a little bit more than when I spoke to them previously last year.'

He said the hottest areas for investors right now are in Sydney's west in areas like Penrith and Blacktown.

Mr Duong told Sydney Morning Herald that the rate cut probably added about $150,000 to the price of one house he sold in Lidcombe, Western Sydney.

‘The interest rate played a big part, otherwise we would only have achieved $1.3 million or $1.35 million for this block,’ he said.

'We didn't expect that sort of price,' he commented.

Meanwhile, in Melbourne 67 per cent of the 135 listed properties were sold. The percentage of those purchased was higher than the previous week before mortgage rates were cut but similar to the same period last year.

The decision by the Reserve Bank on Tuesday to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points is likely to take the typical standard variable mortgage rate down to 5.7 per cent and discounted variable rates to 4.85 per cent; the lowest cost of mortgage debt since July 1968.

The lower mortgage rates appear to have added further fuel to what is already a strong housing market.

Real estate data provider, CoreLogic RP Data, has warned the challenge for the Reserve Bank is to stimulate stronger economic growth without over stimulating the housing market.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said the cut to interest rates was good news for business and households. 'This is good news for Australian families and it's good news for Australian business,' Mr Hockey said in Canberra.

'The government is working hard to take the pressure off interest rates by keeping inflation low.'

Before the mortgage rates were cut, the company CoreLogic RP Data reported that for the week ending February 1, 2015, there was a clearance rate of 61.6 per cent on the 457 auctions held across the capital city market. 

Compare that to the same week a year ago, when the rate was recorded at 64.3 per cent, the rate was lower overall. In January there were 36,931 newly advertised properties added to the market which is 7.7 per cent fewer than at the same time one year ago.
