The Co-operative said sales of its own-brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in week before Christmas and expects to sell three a second today

Sales of prosecco have soared ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations, with one retailer expecting to sell three bottles every second.

The Co-operative said  sales of its own brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in the week before Christmas and it anticipated selling three bottles every second that it is open today - up from two bottles a second on Christmas Eve.

It saw bottles of prosecco outsell milk, the usual best-seller, in the lead-up to Christmas.

The Co-operative Food customer director, Andrew Mann, said: 'As a leading convenience retailer we've seen a shift in consumer habits and prosecco has fast become the nation's favourite drink with which to mark an occasion or celebrate.

'Over the last few days it has even outsold milk.'

Marks & Spencer said sales of prosecco were up 45 per cent on this time last year and it had sold 1.6 million bottles over the last 12 months, up from 1.1 million last year.

M&S wine buyer Dror Nativ said: 'The ongoing prosecco boom has of course been fuelled by the affordability and approachability of this wine, but what is most interesting is the new trend for enjoying prosecco as an everyday drink rather than solely on celebratory occasions.

'Our customers are enjoying prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down.'

Tesco has announced that its prosecco sales are up 50 per cent this year and Waitrose has reported an annual increase of 58 per cent.

Earlier this month wine merchant Laithwaite's predicted prosecco would comfortably outsell Champagne again this Christmas.

Laithwaite's UK managing director David Thatcher said: 'We have a good picture of the nation's habits and prosecco is already outselling Champagne this year.' 

Waitrose said prosecco continued to be the 'fizz of choice' to bring in the New Year, outselling champagne by 1.7 bottles to one.

Waitrose head of wine, beer and spirits-buying Pierpaolo Petrassi said: 'We know that our customers' love for prosecco shows no sign of abating.'

Both Waitrose and Marks & Spencer have reported increases in the sales of their own brand Prosecco
