Get in early: save on popular holidays by booking months ahead or last minute to grab deals. This is a view of Oia Santorini in Greece, one of Europe's most popular areas to visit.

1.) WEDNESDAY IS YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND 

Instead of leaping on the nearest Saturday, think with a more mid-week mind. Less people fly on these days so flight prices drop to attract buyers.

Filip Filipov at travel search site Skyscanner says, ‘Avoiding starting your trip on a weekend can make a huge impact on the price of flights. Try comparing travel from a Wednesday to Wednesday rather than a Friday to Friday.’ 

Thank god it's Wednesday: book mid week to save up to 50 per cent  on flights

Yes, it might mess up your working week but you could save 50 per cent or more. For example, a British Airways flight between London and New York this Saturday returning next Saturday could cost £784 ($1,285) whereas the a similar fight Wednesday to Wednesday is just £450 ($738).

2.) BOOK ONLINE OR THROUGH APPS

Often
 holiday agents reward you for booking online or via their app. The 
usual amount tends to hover at 10 per cent but it can be much more. 
Expedia’s mobile app offers up to 40 per cent savings on last minute 
hotels booked via the app.

3.) SET UP PRICE ALERTS 

Some
 websites offer to keep you in the loop when the price of marked 
holidays or flights drop. This is something you should want to be a part
 of, so long as you aren’t in a rush to book.

Skyscanner
 is one such website. Sign up to their alerts and they will email you 
when the cost of a specific flight route drops. You can track up to 25 
flight options at once.

Last minute deals  before and after main holiday times can win you 50 per cent off full price hotels and flights

4.) BOOK OUT OF SEASON 

Rebecca Baines of Mr & Mrs Smith says, ‘While you do need to be careful about travelling out of season when obviously weather can be less reliable, you do get the best rates.’ 

If you are booking a Caribbean holiday go in May or June, when you can save 30 per cent on rooms compared with December to April. It might rain, but it never gets cold. 

‘In Europe, travelling in May, September and October is often best – you miss the peak crowds, and hotels usually lower their rates,’ says Rebecca. The general rule it to travel a month before or after peak times so that the weather is roughly okay but the rates substantially lower.

5.) BOOK EARLY

Of course it’s obvious, but the earlier you book the better. Rebecca Baines, travel consultant at Mr & Mrs Smith says, ‘If you want to get the best deal for a holiday in Europe, you need to book as far in advance as possible - particularly if you want the pick of the best (or most affordable) bedrooms. 

For  most popular European destinations (Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast and Greece) that means booking as much as nine months in advance. Room rates are usually at their highest when availability is at its lowest.’ Many hotels offer early non-refundable early bird bookings. 

Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, says it’s even more crucial to plan ahead for school holidays. ‘These dates sell out quickly and will rarely go down in price. Don’t travel in the first or last weeks of the school holidays – these are the busiest and most expensive.’

6.) BOOK LATE (ESPECIALLY IN MAY AND SEPTEMBER)

It may go completely go against the previous point, but if you aren’t booking a trip during school holidays - and like living on the edge - gambling by booking late can pay off. 

Bob Atkinson says you can often save as much as 50 per cent in last minute hotel and flight deals as holiday providers sink prices to get you on board if tickets haven’t sold. 

‘These tend to occur just before and just after the main holiday periods with the best late deals usually in May and June and also in late September and October. Last minute travel in January is also often cheap.’

7.) MIX AND MATCH 

Skyscanner's Filip Filipov says, ‘It pays to mix and match your airlines, you can often save money by flying out and back with different airlines or from different airports.’ It’s worth taking time to have a look around and doing your homework - it could save you hundreds.

8.) DON'T GET CAUGHT OUT AT CHECK IN 

When booking flights, use online search tools that  find the lowest fares and show you what extra fees might be added, so you aren't surprised at the gate or check-in. 

TripAdvisor has a flight search tool which helps you find low fares, view baggage fees, compare  legroom and view previous passenger photos from inside the plane. 

SeatGuru is also a helpful site. It will show you where is best to sit on the plane, remind you about airline hand luggage requirements, how long you have to board and  rules on pets and children.

9.) BE FLEXIBLE 

Instead of searching by location or date, search by price. On Skyscanner you can view all the prices of one flight path over a full month, so you can cherry pick the cheapest day. 

Or look by location if you are uncommitted to the final destination and check what the cheapest place to fly to is on the day you want to travel. 

Instead of searching by location or date, look by price and be flexible on where and when you go

TripAdvisor has a similar search function which lets you see real-time room price across a range of booking sites. Basically, if you can be flexible, you’ll be in the money.

10.) SEPTEMBER FOR FLIGHTS

You might just have time to squeeze in a long weekend away before the month is out. You can save 54 per cent on flight fares by travelling in September compared to  August.

According to Skyscanner, travellers in Europe will save the most on flights to Alicante, where the average flight price drops to £133 ($218) in September compared to £286 ($469) in August and temperatures still hit the mid 20C.

Other destinations including Faro, Barcelona and Tenerife also see price drops of over 20 per cent in September while those travelling between London and New York can expect to save 18 per cent at this time of year. If you’ve missed the boat, make sure you don’t next year.

And finally…..

After you’ve shaved off hundreds of pounds using clever holiday-booking tactics, there’s one last financial hurdle; booking the car.

There are a few things you should know to avoid a  sting. If you have children, take your own child seat. Most airlines allow the complimentary carriage of child car seats which will save you having to hire one.

It also could be worth considering taking out annual insurance waivers (from £40/$66) from companies such as www.questor-insurance.co.uk or www.insurance4carhire.com. If you need to add an additional driver, work out when you will need them. 

Most hire companies will let you add an extra driver for just part of your rental, rather than the whole week. The best fuel policy for most car hire companies is to return full, which incurs no charge. The costs for returning empty can be exorbitant.
