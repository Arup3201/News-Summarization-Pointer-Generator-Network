This past weekend was a typical one for Europe’s best golf coach Pete Cowen and his Rotherham-based academy. On Friday, a party of 20 disabled kids visited, including a gifted autistic player who has a decent chance of representing Team GB in the next Paralympics.

On Saturday, more than 100 kids took their first steps towards taking up the game, hitting balls on the range. And then, on Sunday, a gang of thugs broke in through the roof and basically, in Cowen’s words, ‘trashed the place’.

It was the sixth such burglary in six months. And it’s left Cowen wondering what on earth is the point of carrying on.

For some time Cowen has been badgering his local council to do something about a derelict car park at the bottom of the academy that would help secure the premises but, as the whole country has learned recently to its horror, unfit for purpose happens to be this council’s specialist subject.

Still, they’re not alone. Cowen can’t get help from anybody.

Imagine in tennis if they had someone with his track record? Imagine an academy that produced players as good as Danny Willett, who currently leads the Race to Dubai, and Matt Fitzpatrick, the only Englishman in the last 100 years to win the US Amateur Championship?

Picture a British tennis coach so good he pulled off the equivalent of tutoring the top three the last time The Open was staged at St Andrews. This is a man whose teaching skills are so respected 11 of the 12 players who contributed to Europe’s Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles last year were coached or asked for his help at some point. The untold largesse the Lawn Tennis Association would lavish in his direction.

In golf? ‘I’ve been in touch with the various bodies but when you ask for help it falls on deaf ears, unfortunately,’ says Cowen. ‘I’m not looking for any massive handouts. I don’t think you produce great sportsmen and women that way. But we do need a helping hand.

‘My fear is golf is dying at grassroots level. If places like mine are forced to close, what hope is there?’

Cowen wrote to the minister for sport, Helen Grant, and local government minister, Eric Pickles, without reply. But he was cheered slightly by a response from the Prime Minister’s office.

‘The letter said David Cameron shares my concern, which is a start, perhaps,’ said the Yorkshireman.

If truth be told, everyone should share his concern. The Pete Cowen Golf Academy might just be the most successful sports academy in Britain. It is located in a part of the country that desperately needs some help. And it might close?

Is there not somebody of influence in golf or politics who can’t see the blindingly obvious here, and why this simply must not be allowed to happen?

R&A MUST EXPLAIN OPEN CALL  

Rarely  in 30 years writing about golf can I recall an announcement provoking the depth of anger that has followed the Royal and Ancient Golf Club’s decision to take live coverage of The Open away from the BBC.

Indeed, you’d probably have more luck finding business CEOs who support Ed Miliband than golfers who think our leaders have got this one right. I’ve had emails from readers asking me to organise petitions, even a boycott of this year’s Open at St Andrews.

At my local club on Saturday, the verdict was unanimous. ‘Even my friends who are R&A members think it’s a dreadful decision,’ said one influential member, who really would know plenty of R&A types.

Meanwhile, it was announced last week that when the US Open is held on the West Coast this year, those living on the East Coast will be able to watch live, prime-time coverage on free-to-air television of all four days for the first time.

Now that’s what you call a favourable television deal.

A good time, therefore, to be heading to the R&A’s headquarters at St Andrews on Tuesdday to meet under-fire chief executive Peter Dawson to hear his side.

Stay tuned, as they say.

 QUOTE OF THE WEEK 

‘Billy Casper was one of the greatest family men I have had the fortunate blessing to meet. He had such wonderful balance to his life and there was always much more to him than golf. But as a golfer, he was a fantastic player, and never got enough credit for being one. When I looked up at a leaderboard, I wasn’t just looking for Palmer or Player or Trevino. I was also looking for Billy Casper.’

Jack Nicklaus pays tribute to the great American golfer, who passed away on Sunday. Casper was married to Shirley for 62 years, and they raised 11 children and 71 grandchildren and great grandchildren. In the era of the Big Three, he won three majors and 51 times on the PGA Tour to be ranked seventh on the all-time list.
