Michelle Keegan is the envy of countless women with her showstopping hourglass physique and savvy style, so when news of her fashion collaboration with Lipsy hit headlines, we were dying to see the results.

Now, FEMAIL can reveal a first look at some of the Coronation Street star's new designs for the high street chain.

These behind the scenes images reveal Michelle shooting her new fashion range and offer a glimpse of her new collection.

Behind the scenes: These images show Michelle Keegan hard at work on her Lipsy shoot

The 
26-year-old actress positively dazzles as she works her magic in front 
of the camera.

Make-up 
artists can be seen fussing around her in between shoots applying thick 
black eyeliner make-up and re-touching her scarlet lips.

Michelle filmed her final Corrie scenes as Tina McIntyre - who is set to be murdered - on the ITV soap last month.

Now says she is focusing on her upcoming nuptials to reality star Mark 
Wright, with whom she recently bought a home in the Essex countryside - and her Lipsy collection, naturally.

Look familiar? Michelle looks remarkably like Kim Kardashian in her white co-ord, which she has designed for the clothing retailer

Michelle says of her debut line for the brand: 'I have spent a lot of time over
 the last few months working closely with the Lipsy design team to make 
sure that each piece in my collection is something I am excited about 
wearing.'

She added: 'My collection is classic, unfussy and feminine in style, and I canâ€™t wait for it to hit the high street in July.'

collection, which will launch online at Lipsy.co.uk and across all UK
