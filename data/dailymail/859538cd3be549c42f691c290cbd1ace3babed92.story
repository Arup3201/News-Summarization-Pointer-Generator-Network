Swan song: All mute swans could be culled in New York under proposals being considered

New York has hatched a plan to rid the stat of the entire swan population, amid claims the birds have been responsible for attacking people, destroying vegetation and polluting the water with their feces.

Draft proposals suggest killing or resettling New York's 2,200 wild mute swans by 2025.

There are also fears that swans pose a threat to aircraft, much like the flock of geese that collided with a U.S. Airways flight in 2009, causing it to crash on the Hudson river.

Since then the U.S. Department of Agriculture has carried out an annual cull on Canadian geese and wants to extend this to include swans.

Opposition group Goose Watch NYC called the proposals 'outrageous' and said a 2,200-strong population of swans could not really pose a threat to a state where more than 18 million people live.

Watch founder David Karopkin told AFP: 'It's just outrageous to try to 
exterminate an entire species that has been living in the state for more
 than 150 years, almost 200 years.'

He added: 'I've yet to find anyone who has been seriously injured by a mute swan.

'When
 they're being aggressive it's often in relation to them protecting 
their nest, their babies.

'I mean people need to have some common sense.'

Mute swans were first brought to North America from Europe at the turn of the 19th Century, to adorn city parks and large estates.

It is thought that all wild mute swan populations originate from the release or escape of individuals from these early captive flocks.

Wild mute swans have since flourished and the population in New York State alone has tripled over the past 30 years, in part thanks to people feeding the birds.

Among the 'lethal control methods' proposed to cull the birds are: 'Shooting of free-ranging swans and live capture and euthanasia in accordance with established guidelines for wildlife.'

The draft proposals also suggest destroying nests and oiling, puncturing or sterilising eggs to prevent hatching.

Some conservationists believe culling in New York state is absolutely necessary.

Paul Curtis, associate professor of natural resources at Cornell University, said: 'The goal is to limit population growth in the wild, and remove swans from places where they cause problems or do damage to plant communities.'

Meanwhile the state conservation department stands by the proposals, stating that the proposal to resettle the swans makes it 'balanced and comprehensive'.
