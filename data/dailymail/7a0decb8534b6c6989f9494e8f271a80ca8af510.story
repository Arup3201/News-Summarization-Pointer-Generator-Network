A couple whose day-old baby died at a scandal hit maternity unit almost a decade ago have accused hospital staff of an 'unforgiveable cover-up' of failings that led to her death.

Elleanor Bennett was just 27 hours old when she died at the Furness General Hospital in February 2004.

Though her death certificate stated she died of natural causes, the case was referred to the South Cumbria Coroner in March of this year after a police investigation into a number of baby and mother deaths at the hospital.

Devastated: Lesley and Gary Bennett have accused staff at Furness General Hospital of an 'unforgiveable cover-up' over the death of their baby daughter Elleanor

An inquest held almost nine years after her death found that she died of 'as a consequence of complications during the birthing process.'

The hearing at Barrow Town Hall heard that a midwife failed to take Elleanor's heartbeat for 43 minutes during labour and that she had to be resuscitated when she was finally born.

She suffered continuous fits and was transferred to Liverpool Women’s Hospital but died in her father’s arms the next day.

Although an internal investigation into Elleanor's death found failings by midwife Marie Ratcliffe, the Bennett family were never informed.

Coroner Ian Smith today criticised the actions of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust for failing to 'bite the bullet' and not explaining to Lesley and Gary Bennett how their daughter died.

Eleanor's parents today called for the NHS to ensure a robust duty of candour is implemented so that the same mistakes don't happen again.

The two-day inquest was told that Mrs Bennett’s third pregnancy went smoothly before she went into labour a week overdue.

She had been classified as high risk because of her high body mass index and scans had showed it was anticipated to be a large baby.

Her waters were broken by a male registrar at 8.05pm on February 25 but he did not enter the maternity room again.

Ten minutes later, Elleanor's heartbeat was noted as being 'perfectly satisfactory.

But despite national guidelines ruling that a baby's heart rate must be checked every five minutes, Elleanor's was not monitored again by Ms Ratcliffe for the next 43 minutes.

When the midwife was unable to find a heartbeat via a cardiotocography (CTG) machine and a hand-held sonic aid device at around 8.45pm, she asked for help from a senior midwifery colleague.

'An opportunity to get Elleanor out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened.'

The baby was born 13 minutes later, weighing 10lbs 10ozs, but had turned blue by the time she was placed on her mother's stomach.

Coroner Mr Smith criticised the staff for not immediately contacting the duty doctor and missing an opportunity to potentially save Elleanor's life.

Mr Smith said it was not as if the doctor was unavailable to assess the situation.

He said: 'That would have given them the opportunity to get the baby out as soon as possible by whatever means you can whether through forceps delivery or caesarean.

'That opportunity to get Elleanor out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened.'

He said it was 'most likely' that Elleanor was starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage during the 43-minute period she went unchecked.

Failings: An internal review carried out by the hospital's then head of midwifery was 'thorough' and 'pulled no punches' according to the coroner, but Mr and Mrs Bennett were left in the dark

The hearing was told that an internal review was carried out by the health trust in 2004 and criticised the actions of Ms Ratcliffe, who was sent on a two-day training course, but the Bennetts were unaware of the investigation.

The investigation, carried out by the hospital's then head of midwifery Denise Fish was 'thorough' and 'pulled no punches', said Mr Smith.

A memo written by Miss Fish as part of the review stated if the case went to litigation then expert witnesses would certainly query the 43-minute gap in the heart rate measurement.

It went on that if she did not know that Ms Ratcliffe was a competent and experienced staff member then she would have concluded 'there was negligence by omission'.

'The consequence of all of that is we are
all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that
should have happened eight or so years ago.'

Coroner Ian Smith

The coroner remarked: 'That is a very straight and damning piece of evidence which said there was a delay and there should not have been.'

He added: 'I think someone should have bit the bullet and said (to the Bennetts) "we really need to level with you and let you know why Elleanor did not survive" and they did not do that.

'The consequence of all of that is we are all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that should have happened eight or so years ago.'

The police probe into Elleanor's death was launched three months after an inquest in June 2011 held by the same coroner into the death of baby Joshua Titcombe.

Mr Smith ruled Joshua died of natural causes nine days after his birth at the hospital in October 2008 but that midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection.

Speaking after the hearing, the Bennetts, from Dalton-in-Furness, said: 'We were told that her death was one of those things and that no procedures could be changed to prevent it from happening again.

'With the help of family and friends we tried to rebuild our lives for the sake of our other children.

'In October 2011, the police came to our door to tell us that they were investigating a number of deaths at Furness General Hospital, and that Elleanor’s was one of those cases.

'Since then, we have found out so much that was never revealed to us and this has totally devastated our entire family. We have had to restart the grieving process all over again.

'We now have the truth about what went wrong that night and this means we can try again to move on as a family and Elleanor can now rest in peace.

'We hope that lessons can be learned and that her death will not have been in vain. We urge the Government to ensure that the duty of candour is implemented and robustly enforced within the NHS.

'Our wish is that no family should have to go through what we have.

'We understand that nobody meant for this to happen, but to lie, cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from them is unforgiveable.'

George Nasmyth, Medical Director of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust apologised to the family following the inquest and said that lessons had been learned.

He said: 'We extend our sincere condolences to baby Elleanor Bennett's family. For any family to lose a loved one is an absolute tragedy and having to revisit a very painful time from 2004 is extremely difficult.

'We understand that nobody meant for this
to happen, but to lie, cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from 
them is unforgiveable.'

Lesley and Gary Bennett

'Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to them.

'We acknowledge that full information wasn't shared with the family at the time of Elleanor's death and we apologise for this.

'We have now improved our systems to ensure that in similar circumstances, information is shared with the family concerned as soon as possible.

'We have accepted that some of the care provided to Mrs Bennett in 2004 during the course of her labour and delivery was inappropriate and that steps should have been taken to deliver Elleanor sooner.

'We fully accept the Coroner's conclusion that Elleanor died as a result of complications during the birthing process, and we are sincerely sorry for this.'

'During the last 12 months significant progress has been made with a new Trust Board in place and clinicians leading changes in the way we operate.

'A new clinical leadership team for our maternity services has a clear vision of providing safe and excellent care which will meet the needs and expectations of mothers and babies.'
