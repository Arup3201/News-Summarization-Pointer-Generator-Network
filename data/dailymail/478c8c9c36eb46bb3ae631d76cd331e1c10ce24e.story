These beautiful flamingos are ready for the start of spring after they all passed their annual health check.

The flock of 100 Chilean birds were put through their paces by staff at Chester Zoo, Cheshire.

The brightly coloured birds were assessed by the zoo's expert keepers and vets on their weight, the condition of their feet, legs and skull size.  

Health check: These flamingos have passed their annual MOT by experts at Chester Zoo

Tracking: The beautiful birds are also being chipped to ensure they can be found and monitored

Wild flamingo chase: This fleeing fowl also had its skull measured so its sex can be determined

They are also ringed and fitted with microchips by the zoo's expert bird keepers and vets so that they can be identified and monitored in future.  

By measuring their skulls, staff can find out the sex of the bird.  

Andrew Owen, Curator of birds, said: 'We are keen to assess the condition of every flamingo and make sure that they are happy and healthy prior to the breeding season, which will begin in late spring.  

'It's a very important part of our programme of care for the birds. And it is also really useful for us to know who's who - the females have usually got much smaller skulls.  

'On top of this the checks will help us to be able to identify each and every one of the birds and look at how different pairs bond, as it's not yet known whether or not flamingos choose different mates over the course of their lives or for how long they breed for.  

'This kind of information can then be passed on to help conservationists in the wild and help protect the long term future of the species.'  

Hard at work: Zoo staff have checked more than 100 birds in recent days to help protect their futures

Beautiful: The birds are considered an endangered species because poachers target their eggs

Precise: The pink wading birds also had their feet assessed and their legs and skulls were measured

The birds have been kept at the zoo since the 1960s.  

Chilean flamingos are also found in Argentina and Bolivia and are classed as a near threatened species with just 200,000 to 300,000 left in the wild.  The birds - which are a target for poachers who steal their eggs - are expected to become endangered with a high risk of extinction in the near future.
