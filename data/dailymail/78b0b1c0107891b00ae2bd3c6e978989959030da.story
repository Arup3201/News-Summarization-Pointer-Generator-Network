Climate - changing? The glaciers in the Karakoram Range between northern Pakistan and western China have actually grown, rather than shrinking

Huge glaciers in the area between Pakistan and China are puzzling scientists - and disproving the doom-laden predictions of some climate experts.

The glaciers in the Karakoram Range between northern Pakistan and western China have actually grown, rather than shrinking.

Unlike most mountain glaciers, the Karakoram glaciers, which account for 3 percent of the total ice-covered area in the world, excluding Greenland and Antarctica, are not shrinking.

A team of French glaciologists has recently confirmed that these glaciers on average have remained stable or may have even grown slightly in recent years.

The new study used data from satellites to study the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan and western China.

The researchers found that the ice had actually increased in thickness by 0.11 (plus or minus 0.22) meters per year between 1999 and 2008.

Experts cautioned that the gain is so small that the glaciers might not actually be growing - but what is clear is that the glaciers are not shrinking, according to a report published in Nature Geoscience.

Etienne Berthier, a glaciologist at the Université de Toulouse in France says, 'Not all glacial regions are changing in the same way.'

A Nasa study earlier this year using the gravity-sensing GRACE satellites hinted that ice loss in the high Asian mountains might be far less drastic than earlier predictions.

Previous estimates of 
ice loss in the high Asia mountains have ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, according to the University of Colorado Boulder University's Professor John Wahr.

Previously,
 it had been claimed by the UN that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a 
fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought.

Those
 predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study 
measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an 
accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost.

‘The results in this region really
 were a surprise,’ said Wahr.

‘One possible explanation is that previous
 estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the 
lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer 
the behavior of higher glaciers.'

'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of 
the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the 
presence of atmospheric warming.’

Around the world, melting has been overestimated. Earth's glaciers and ice caps are 
shedding roughly 150 billion tons of ice annually - up to 30 per cent lower 
than predicted.  

The researchers used satellite 
measurements taken with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or 
GRACE,, to calculate that the world's
 glaciers and ice caps had lost about 148 billion tons, or about 39 
cubic miles of ice annually from 2003 to 2010.

Traditional estimates of Earth's ice 
caps and glaciers have been made using ground-based measurements from 
relatively few glaciers to infer what all of the unmonitored glaciers 
around the world were doing, he said.

Only a few hundred of the roughly 200,000 glaciers worldwide have been monitored for a decade or more.

‘The strength of GRACE is that it 
sees everything in the system,’ said Wahr. ‘Even though we don't have 
the resolution to look at individual glaciers, GRACE has proven to be an
 exceptional tool.’

The total does not count 
the mass from individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the 
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets -- roughly an additional 80 billion 
tons.

Nasa's twin Grace satellites measured ice loss far more accurately than previous studies, which used ground-based estimates

Launched
 in 2002, two GRACE satellites whip around Earth in tandem 16 times a 
day at an altitude of about 300 miles, sensing subtle variations in 
Earth's mass and gravitational pull.

Separated
 by roughly 135 miles, the satellites measure changes in Earth's gravity
 field caused by regional changes in the planet's mass, including ice 
sheets, oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers.

A
 positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over Greenland, 
for example, tugs the lead GRACE satellite away from the trailing 
satellite, speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two.

A
 sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of 
the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron- about 1/100 the width 
of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular
 regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields. 

‘The
 total amount of ice lost to Earth's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would 
cover the entire United States in about 1 and one-half feet of water,’ 
said Wahr, also a fellow at the CU-headquartered Cooperative Institute 
for Research in Environmental Sciences.

According
 to the GRACE data, total sea level rise from all land-based ice on 
Earth including Greenland and Antarctica was roughly 1.5 millimeters per
 year annually or about 12 millimeters, or one-half inch, from 2003 to 
2010, said Wahr.
