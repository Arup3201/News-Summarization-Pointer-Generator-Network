Arnold Schwarzenegger is selling the diesel-guzzling behemoth off-road utility vehicle he bought after famously signing into law one of California's most sweeping anti-emissions laws to date.

The former governor bought his 5-ton, 12 miles-per-gallon Unimog back in 2012, perhaps to complement his past purchases of personal tank and HumVee.

Now the 1977 Unimog U1300 refitted to the Terminator star's specifications--complete with a dashboard bearing his signature--can be yours for $275,000.

Tons of fun: Seen here driving the behemoth in 2012, Arnold Schwarzenegger has placed his personal Unimog up for sale for around $275,000

A car to match his persona: Arnold has purchased a personal military tank and HumVee, as well. The Unimog is a utility truck known across much of the world for its ruggedness and adaptability. At right, the action star reaches up to open the door of the truck in Brentwood, California

Conspicuous: Here, the Unimog, which can only reach around 60MPH, sits at a Los Angeles curb

That's with the mark-up that comes with having a superstar as its previous owner, reports Fox News.

Schwarzenegger actually paid $25,000 or so less when he purchased the vehicle.

It's unclear exactly what he did with the massive truck while it remained in his possession over the last couple of years.

The utility vehicles are well-known outside the US as construction and military vehicles. But if he used the Unimog for anything like he does his personal tank, that's not why he purchased it.

Earlier this year, the action star posted a YouTube video that asked the question 'Will it Crush?' along with his personal tank attempting to squash everything from a roll of bubble wrap to a Microsoft Zune.

A real steal: Arnold even customized his Unimog by signing the dash

Unimogs are a Mercedes vehicle known much better outside the United States, where they are not sold.

Arnold purchased his 1977 Unimog U1300 in 2012 and updated it to his personal specifications.

In addition to being the only Unimog to feature the Terminator's signature on the dash, the vehicle boasts:
