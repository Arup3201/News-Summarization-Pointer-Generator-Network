England’s series victory over India has seen them move up to third in the Reliance International Cricket Council Test rankings.

Alastair Cook’s men wrapped up a 3-1 victory in the five-match Investec Test series with a comprehensive victory at The Oval and have moved up two places in the ICC’s rankings as a result.

A 1-0 defeat by Sri Lanka earlier in the summer had seen them drop to fifth, but they are now just behind South Africa and Australia, albeit some way adrift.

Moving on up: England are now third in the IC rankings following the win over India

1) South Africa

2) Australia

3) England

4) Sri Lanka

5) India

6) Pakistan

7) New Zealand

8) West Indies

9) Zimbabwe

10) Bangladesh 

India have slipped one place to fifth with Sri Lanka’s series win over Pakistan moving them into fourth, with Pakistan dropping to sixth.

England’s Joe Root, meanwhile, has continued his surge up the batsmen’s rankings after breaking into the top 10 for the first time.

The Yorkshireman is England’s highest-ranked batsman and he now sits in ninth place following his 149 not out in London over the weekend.

His innings was the fifth time he had passed 50 in the series, one in every match to replicate a feat achieved previously by only two Englishmen.

Captain Alastair Cook ended his slump in form to move up to 21st, while Gary Ballance’s excellent summer has helped him to 24th.

Stuart Broad has risen to eighth in the bowler’s rankings, while Moeen Ali has also moved up one place to 32nd.
