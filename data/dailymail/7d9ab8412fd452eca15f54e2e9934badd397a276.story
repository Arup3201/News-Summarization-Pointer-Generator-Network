Chloe Sims enraged Ferne McCann when she confronted her about about the footage taken of Ferne flirting with a man while holidaying without boyfriend Charlie, who happens to be Chloe's brother.

Now things could get even frostier between the pair after it was revealed that Chloe has taken over design duties at the fashion house that Ferne previously created clothes for.

TOWIE star Chloe has been unveiled as the latest designer for online fashion retailer, Lasula.

Chloe was last seen facing off with 
younger brother Charlie's girlfriend after video footage emerged in 
which she flirts with a mystery man while holidaying in Las Vegas 
earlier this year.

The exclusive footage of McCann getting close to the man was from her recent break.

It shows a bikini-clad Ferne with her arms around the unknown 
gentleman amongst hundreds of revellers at the Calvin Harris pool party 
at Wet Republic MGM Grand in Vegas on May 26.

Perhaps assuming she is hidden among the crowd the reality star looks lost in the moment while enjoying the man’s company.

An
eyewitness at the party told MailOnline: ‘Ferne looked very comfortable
with the man and wasn’t shy about kissing him in public’

Aside from her pubic spat with Ferne, Chloe’s latest appearance was heated 
for an altogether different reason as she enjoyed a very public display 
of affection with TOWIE Co-star Elliott Wright.

The
 31-year-old sported a bold red swimsuit while frolicking 
with the strapping hunk as cast and crew continue filming their annual 
Marbella-based episode in and around the Spanish coastal city.
