Rather than simply - and cheaply - cleaning a dirty roundabout warning sign, a bumbling council instead decided to install a brand new sign just two foot in front of the old one.

Council contractors then left the dirty old sign on Rundle Road, Sheffield in place.

The staggering waste of taxpayer money has left residents of Sheffield City Council seeing red as well as double, with one man accusing the council of ‘squandering money’.

Seeing double: Sheffield Council install a brand new roundabout sign, directly in front of the old one

‘Typical of Sheffield City Council. Experts at squandering money. Our money!’ Tweeted furious resident Pete Flynn.

Another resident, Mark Hope, said the council could ‘add it to the list of failures and the millions they waste.'

The furore has forced Sheffield Council to explain itself. The council is blaming ‘cutbacks’ for the double up, with Councillor Jack Scott claiming ‘Because of massive cuts to Sheffield by the coalition, we need to cut back.

Waste of money: Furious residents want to know why the council didn't just clean the old sign

‘We will remove the old sign and pole and use the value of the metal to reduce the cost of the new sign. This change is a small one-off expense for an ongoing saving, so it's worth doing.

'There’s no point having lights on in the middle of the night when nobody is there, just wasting electricity.'

But Mr Flynn isn't convinced, claiming that the council's sums don't add up.

'So do you buy a new car when it gets dirty to save money? I can't wait to vote these geniuses out,' he said.
