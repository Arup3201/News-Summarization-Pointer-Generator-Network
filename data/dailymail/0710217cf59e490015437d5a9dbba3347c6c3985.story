A World War I-era cottage went under the hammer for $1.2 million on Tuesday.

The Paddington home in inner-city Sydney has been frozen in time for a century, a period through which it was owned by one family.

The bidding, which was directed by Damien Cooley, was left to three builders, who would seemingly have had an advantage in refurbishing the Victorian workers' cottage, reports Property Observer.  

A house frozen in time from 100 years has gone uner the hammer for $1.2million, complete with bedpans, outdoor toilet and a wireless which could have possibly broadcast the end of World War I

The Paddington home in inner-city Sydney, had been kept by one family since 1915 and is still completely in its original condition

The builders could embark on the necessary restoration for about $400,000, a job which would cost double that for non-builders.

Mr Cooley was reportedly reluctant to accept the $900,000 opening bid, and the property is believed to have garnered an over $1 million price tag.

Records show it was last sold when a tram worker bought it for £400 around 100 years ago. 

The Victorian home on 6 Broughton Street could be one of the last examples of the suburb's early 'workers cottages' and comes complete with an Arnotts biscuit tin and a fly swatter.  

Nestled on a laneway amongst renovated cottages, the house is easy to bypass but inside it is hidden with historic gems 

A combined laundry-bathroom-kitchen complete with the double wash tub and hot water cooper fill up the bathroom area 

Outside, two paths run parallel down the garden. A little outdoor toilet is as the bottom of the garden, near the laneway

There are also a huge fly swatter next to the old-fashioned stove and vintage furniture adorns the house. A modern refrigerator has been added to the house.

In the two-bedroom house, two ornate dressing tables sit in the corner of the master bedroom, along with bedpans and a fireplace.

A kettle sits on the stove in the bathroom and a dresser features towels and jugs which would have been used for washing in that era.

The house is open for inspection starting from February 25th and will go on auction on March 17th

The grass is withered but the time capsule house is well-kept and nothing is overgrown. 

It is expected that the house will sell for well over $1 million. A similar house in Paddington, which hadn't been touched in 40 years sold for over $2.5 million in 2013.  

The house is open for inspection starting from February 25th and will go on auction on March 17th. 

Bradfield Cleary auctioneers believe the 'home offers a truly unique and exciting opportunity to capitalise in one of the east's most sought-after locations'.
