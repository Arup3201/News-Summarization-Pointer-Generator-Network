Hitting the high seas for a day of sailing requires a lot of kit, but now there’s a compact dingy that can fit in the boot of a car.

A French company has created what it claims to be the first high performance inflatable sailing dinghy for water sports that can travel at high speeds on a windy day.

The Tiwal 3.2 weighs just 111 lbs (50kg) and folds away into two bags that can easily fit in the boot of a car.

A French company has created what it claims to be the first high performance inflatable sailing dinghy for water sports that can travel at high speeds on a windy day

Length: 10.5ft (3.2metres)

Weight: 111lbs (50kg)

Sail area: 56 sqft (5.2 metres squared) or 75 sqft (7.2 metres squared)

Maximum load: 418lbs (180kg)

Capacity: Two adults or one adult and two children

Bags: One bag for the hull and another for the sail and structure

Price: €5,490 (£4,521) or €5,840 (£4,809)

Its creators, based in Vannes, north-west France, claim the whole inflatable vessel can be assembled in just 20 minutes.

The dinghy’s ‘versatile design allows for both high performance solo use and leisure sailing in pairs,’ the company said.

The boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail measuring 56 square feet (5.2 metres squared) – and a larger 75 square feet (7.2 square metres) size is also available.

It is designed to be used competitively in rough waters as well as for leisurely trips for multiple sailors on calm seas.

Using its sails, the dinghy can reach a top speed of around 13 mph (22 km/h) which, according to Gizmag is double the speed of other dinghies on the market.

‘It’s a leisure boat, a boat for thrills and a multi-purpose vessel,’ the company said.

The vessel has a V-shaped underbody and claims to be more stable than conventional rigid dinghys, as well as a boomless sail with high clearance so that sailors have maximum mobility on deck.

The boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail that is slightly larger than five metres squared and a larger seven metres squared size is also available

The wide underbody also allows the dingy to accelerate quickly to reach planing speed – when a boat's centre of gravity moves up so there is less resistance from waves - in three to four force winds, which is a light to moderate breeze.

In the event of capsizing, the boat can be righted by facing it into the wind and pushing the underwater wing down, while pulling on the daggerboard.

The boat can be stored in two bags, each weighing 62lbs (28kg) which are designed to be easy to stored – perhaps even in a cubby hole of a larger yacht.

Made from the same PVC material used to build motor boats, the dinghy’s hull is created to be robust and to withstand occasional scrapes.

The Tiwal 3.2 costs €5,490 (£4,521) for the vessel with a smaller sized sail and €5,840 (£4,809) for the model with the seven metre sail, although ironically shipping costs have to be negotiated with the company.

The compact yacht is light enough to be carried to the water by two people, although the company is also rolling out a trolley so that one person can handle the craft - from the boot of their car to the sea - independently
