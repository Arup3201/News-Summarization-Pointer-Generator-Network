Two young women found dead in mysterious circumstances are feared to have fallen victim to a deadly batch of party drugs nicknamed 'Dr Death', police revealed today.

Oil rig worker Rachel Clayton and her partner Emma Speed were discovered at their home in Macclesfield earlier this month after a friend went to check up on them.

It was initially believed that the women, who had been carrying out renovation work, may have succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, but that possibility was soon ruled out.

Now toxicology tests have revealed that the victims had PMA, a drug similar to ecstasy, in their system at the time of their death.

The discovery has prompted urgent warnings over the dangers of the drugs, as a 34-year-old men found dead in a caravan in Macclesfield in February also had traces of PMA in his body.

'While we would always urge people not to take any illegal substances, I am particularly keen to emphasise the dangers and potentially life threatening consequences of PMA,' said Ruth Purdie of Cheshire Police.

'We have now had three deaths in Cheshire which appear to be linked to the drug and therefore I feel I have a duty to warn people about the potentially fatal consequences taking this drug can have.

'It is our duty to join up with our colleagues in the health service and make as many people as possible aware of the risk this drug poses and to do all we can to ensure no one dies and prevent further heartache for any more families.

'If anyone has any information about who is supplying this drug across Cheshire I would urge them to contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously so we can respond to this potential risk and take them off the streets.'

Killer: PMA, known as 'Dr Death', has been linked to a number of deaths of young people in recent months

Earlier this year, the sudden deaths of 20-year-old Charlotte Woodiwiss and four young men were also linked to a deadly batch of PMA.

The drug is often shaped like a Love Heart, and is known as 'Dr Death, 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Mitsubishi Turbos' or 'Pink McDonalds', although its scientific name is para-Methoxyamphetamine.

The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet, are usually pink or white and often have the letter 'M' printed on them.

It is sold to clubbers for as little as Â£3 a pill - dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy, but it is five times as strong and can cause the body temperature to rise dangerously.

In addition, because it takes effect relatively slowly, revellers sometimes take multiple pills to speed up its effect.

Investigation: Police outside the house in Macclesfield where the couple were discovered on April 7

Janet Clowes, who sits on Cheshire Council, said: 'The risks from taking potentially contaminated and unregulated drugs are very high.

'If you are concerned about someone you know who may be at risk or want help for yourself there are a number of services in Cheshire East which can help.

'You can access free confidential advice and information as well as the different types of treatment options that are available to you.'

Ms Clayton, 34, and Ms Speed, 30, were found inside their terraced house on April 7 by a friend who had a key to the home.

The former was on a short break from her job working on an oil rig in the North Sea, and had been proudly showing off her new Volkswagen Scirocco.

She had recently posted on Facebook: 'Home tomoz thank didily I'm becoming a recluse after 3 weeks in the North Sea' [sic].

In a statement Ms Clayton's parents Malcolm and Sue said: 'Rachel enjoyed life to the full. She was a special daughter and was very family orientated. We will miss her greatly.'

Ms Speed's family said: 'She had a good heart and would do anything for anyone.'
