Married: Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her husband Stephen Kinnock, the son of Neil Kinnock

A Tory minister has criticised the growing trend of politicians' children following in their footsteps.

Education minister Liz Truss said having too many MPs from the same family leads to the 'usual suspects' winning elections and undermining the meritocracy.

She took aim at Labour's 'Red Princes' – the children of former ministers running for Parliament – but said the problem could be found in every party.

Miss Truss spoke out after Stephen 
Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and his ex-MEP wife 
Glenys, was selected as Labour's candidate for the safe seat of Aberavon
 in South Wales on Saturday.

Both his parents are members of the House of Lords and his wife is Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Danish prime minister.

Will
 Straw, son of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, has also been 
selected as a Labour candidate.

Tony Blair's eldest son Euan is eyeing a
 seat in Coventry and David Prescott, whose father is John Prescott, is 
also hoping to run next year.

Miss
 Truss condemned the House of Commons dynasties saying the prevalence of
 so many related MPs is more damaging than the number of public school 
pupils at the top of government.

She
 said: 'There are some brilliant children of MPs who are MPs like my 
colleague Ben Gummer [son of former Tory Cabinet minister John Gummer, 
now Lord Deben] but what I do want us to see is a more open 
politics…

'This weekend we've seen Stephen Kinnock selected for a safe 
seat and there are so-called “Red Princes” in the Labour party,' she told BBC Radio 5Live's Pienaar's Politics.

Miss Truss added: 'It's not just about public school boys or girls, it's actually about people coming from the same family, people who have always been involved in politics, being involved in politics.'

She called for moves to 'broaden it 
out beyond the usual suspects' by encouraging people to run for office 
in their areas  'so that people feel part of their local community … and
 aspire to enter Parliament'.

'If
 you look at the Labour team we've got a husband and wife in the top 
team – we've got brothers in the Labour party as well,' she added. 'What
 we want to do is enable everybody to aspire to be part of the political
 system.'

A recent survey by House of Commons officials found that 57 of the 650 people with a seat in the Commons are related to other serving or former MPs.

It includes six married couples, 21 MPs whose parents served in the Commons and three pairs of siblings.

The couples include Labour's Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Liberal Democrat MPs Duncan Hames and Jo Swinson.

In Mr Dromey's case an all-women shortlist was torn up so he could become a candidate and the couple's son Joe, a Labour council candidate, is tipped as a future MP.

The Tories are not immune to dynasties. Nick Hurd, minister for civil society, is the son of former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and Jacob Rees-Mogg is son of former minister William, the late Lord Rees-Mogg.

David Cameron's great-grandfather Sir William Mount was a Tory MP twice between 1900 and 1922.

When he announced he was seeking selection, Mr Kinnock said: 'I have been a member of the Labour Party since I was 15 years old … politics is in my blood.

'But it was always important for me to build my own career before making the decision to stand.'
