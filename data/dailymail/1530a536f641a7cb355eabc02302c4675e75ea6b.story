A team of British computer hackers as young as 16 who call themselves ‘Isis’ were today facing extradition to the US for allegedly threatening to carry out school massacres.

Investigators suspect three people in the UK - two of whom are said to be in Scotland - are linked to more than 12 hoax calls threatening mass murder, hostage taking and the release of poisonous gas.

The calls made on Skype are believed to have cost US authorities more than £600,000 ($1million) in emergency response units - and the UK gang members face up to 15 years in jail if convicted.

Under threat: Police sent a bomb squad to deal with threats at the University of Connecticut's admissions building on April 3. It later turned out that this was a hoax

It is unknown if Islamist extremists were behind the hoax calls - or if the name ‘Isis’ was being used by pranksters seeking to spread distrust of Muslims, reported Sunday Times journalist Dipesh Gadher.

Investigators are looking into the group’s activities in Britain after an American was arrested earlier this month on charges related to a bomb threat called into the University of Connecticut in April.

Matthew Tollis, 21, spilled details about a global group of Xbox gamers behind multiple hoaxes, including a call to the recently re-opened Sandy Hook Elementary School, an FBI document said.

MailOnline reported on Friday how Tollis revealed details about 'swatting' with TeAM CrucifiX or Die, a group of gamers who used Skype calls to plant bomb threats and intimidate government officials.

'Swatting' is the practice of calling in fake bomb threats to bring Swat and police response against targeted victims.

According
 to investigators, Tollis first started following two members of the 
group on Twitter after being harassed online, believing that following 
the two would prevent further abuse.

Tollis had been 'pizza bombed,' a 
prank where huge numbers of pizzas are delivered to a target's home, and
 'doxed,' which involves publicly revealing private information like 
social security numbers and passwords.

Investigators say the first 
'swatting' that Tollis participated in was a call to Hebron High School 
in Carrollton, Texas, in which the caller said a student was in 
possession of a firearm or bomb.

As Swat officers arrived at the high 
school, members of the group tweeted about the bomb threat, according to
 tweets cached and posted on Pastebin, a plain text sharing site.

On Twitter, ‘Declaws’ took 
responsibility for the bomb threat and 'Inb4mad' posted a screenshot of 
the Skype call used to make it. The tweets have since been deleted and 
the account for ‘Declaws’ has been deactivated.

Tollis told the FBI that he also 
participated in bomb threats against two New Jersey high schools, UConn,
 Boston University and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.

Photographs from the Hartford Courant show bomb technicians and heavily armed police responding to the threat at UConn.

The Boston Convention and Exhibition 
Center in Massachusetts was hosting an exhibition for gamers with 
attendance predicted to reach 60,000, when it received a bomb threat.

The caller identified himself as Matt 
Haag, an Iraqi national 'working for Allah' and said he had planted 
plastic explosives around the building the night before.

FBI investigators were also able to 
confirm the group was responsible for other 'swatting' actions, though 
without the participation of Hollis.

In
 one, a 14-year-old paid a member of the group £18 ($30) through PayPal to 
call in a threat against a private residence in Willimantic, 
Connecticut.

Calling via Skype from Scotland, 'Robert' told police he had shot his mother and was still armed.

Several nearby schools were locked down and a dozen officers responded to the scene, which only deescalated when residents inside spotted police and left the home to speak with them.

After another threat in Connecticut, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office sent an administrative subpoena to Twitter asking for subscriber information on an account for ‘Eviljordie’, which Twitter passed on to the user without advanced notice to law enforcement, according to the FBI affidavit.

Using Skype, a caller phoned a paralegal from the District Attorney's Office listed on the subpoena, claiming he was 'ordering a hit man' on her.

Investigators say in August a member of the group called Sandy Hook Elementary, where a 2012 mass shooting claimed the lives of 20 children and 6 children, and said he was coming with an assault rifle to 'kill all your [expletive].'

Tollis is awaiting trial on federal charges and officials said last week the investigation was ongoing.
