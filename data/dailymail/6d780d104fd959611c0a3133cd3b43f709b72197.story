Pepper spray: The TSA agent was 'playing around' with the canister he found at JFK (file photo)

An airport security worker who discovered a container of pepper spray at JFK sprayed five of his colleagues with the chemical as he was 'playing around' with the canister.

All six TSA screeners were taken to hospital, and security checks at JFK were said to have been held up for at least 15 minutes following the incident in Terminal 2.

Chris Yves Dabel is said to have told Port Authority officials he discovered the canister on the floor at a security checkpoint, and and 'thought it was a laser pointer'.

'They were playing around with it', a member of staff at the airport told the New York Post.

The agents were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center after Mr Dabel doused five co-workers with pepper spray.

Mr Dabel refused medical attention, the report said.

The Transport Security Administration, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has come under fire recently after an undercover federal inspector managed to get past agents at Newark Airport with a fake bomb hidden in his pants.

Earlier this month a former agent who used to work at Newark said of his one-time colleagues: 'I wouldn't trust them to walk my dog.'

'We're not any big deterrent. It's all for show,' the anonymous ex-screener told the New York Post.
