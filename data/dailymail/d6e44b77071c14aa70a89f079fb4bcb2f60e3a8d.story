Waiting: Seven-year-old Sienna Singleton needs heart surgery

A girl of seven faces an agonising wait for heart surgery after operations were suspended at a scandal-hit hospital.

Sienna Singleton was expecting an ‘imminent’ admission to Leeds General Infirmary. But its paediatric unit has been shut since Thursday night after it emerged that its mortality rate may be twice the national average.

Sienna, who needs a third major operation to treat a congenital heart defect, must wait to find out if the unit will reopen or if space must be found at a specialist hospital elsewhere.

Her mother Kerry, 33, from Doncaster, said: ‘Sienna has been telling everyone that she cannot wait to have her heart surgery. 

‘She comes home from school every day and says “Has the hospital rung yet?”. She knows it will make her better.

‘We are worried about the future. Sienna loves the infirmary, she knows the staff and the hospital and she feels safe there. We don’t want to travel to Newcastle or Liverpool and be treated somewhere unfamiliar. It must be even worse for those children who had dates for surgery this week.’

Like many others, Sienna’s parents now face an agonising wait to find out if the unit will re-open or if space must be found at one of the other specialist hospitals across the UK, including London and Birmingham.

Mrs Singleton, 33, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said: ‘We are worried about the future. Sienna loves the infirmary, she knows the staff and the hospital and she feels safe there.

‘We don’t want to travel to Newcastle or Liverpool and be treated somewhere unfamiliar.

‘It must be even worse for those children who had dates for surgery this week, only for it to be cancelled.

‘To take such drastic action with no contact with myself or others is disgusting.’

It comes amid shocking allegations from other parents of botched operations and poor treatment at the hospital’s cardiac unit.

There were also concerns that relatively junior surgeons had been left in charge of the unit after a senior surgeon was banned from operating on children while ‘aspects of his practice’ were investigated.

But MPs and some parents have claimed the decision to suspend surgery at the unit was politically-motivated and ‘suspicious’ timing.

Yesterday, a spokesman for the hospital said: ‘I would love to say that no operations will be delayed but, inevitably, when you are being transferred between centres, it is likely that some operations will be carried out later than scheduled.’ 

A meeting between the unit’s clinicians, NHS specialists and the hospital is scheduled for today.
