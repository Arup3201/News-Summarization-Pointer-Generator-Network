Christian Benteke was dropped by Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert for the visit of Chelsea.

The Belgian striker was taken out of the starting line-up after a series of disappointing displays.

Instead, Gabby Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann started up front, with Lambert hoping to break at pace against the Premier League leaders.

The Belgium international came off the substitutes' bench in the 68th minute but was unable to make an impact against Jose Mourinho's side. 

Benteke at his best would be undroppable, and he has scored excellent goals against United, Crystal Palace and Blackpool in the FA Cup this season.

But they are his only three strikes so far since his recovery from a ruptured Achilles.

The Villa manager tried to buy Rickie Lambert for £5million on transfer deadline day before the England striker elected to stay at Liverpool.

‘If I’d brought another striker in I could have played with two up front and taken the spotlight off Christian,’ said Lambert. ‘He knows himself things aren’t going his way at this moment. It has not gone unnoticed.

‘He’s looked at the stats himself. He’s not naive or silly. We’ve sat with him as staff and showed him things he can improve on.

‘Christian’s belief has not wavered. It’s not a confidence thing. His form is just not what it has been. I don’t think the injury is a problem.' 

It was a bold move by Lambert, given the potential for scorn from the stands by fans, but there is a sense the club's most potent striker could use a spell out of the spotlight.
