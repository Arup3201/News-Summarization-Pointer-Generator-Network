Premier League referee Mike Jones will be the fourth official during West Ham's home game against Swansea on Sunday - a week after wrongly showing Sergio Aguero a yellow card for diving.

The 46-year-old, who had already been appointed as referee for Tuesday night's clash between West Brom and the Hammers, has come in for criticism after booking the forward during Manchester City's 3-0 win against Southampton.

Aguero appeared to be fouled inside Saints' area by defender Jose Fonte but Jones awarded Ronald Koeman's side a free-kick and cautioned the Argentine for simulation.

There has been no indication from the Premier League that Jones not being given a match to officiate is related to his performance at St Mary's on Sunday.

Former Premier League referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll believes Jones' decision to show Aguero a yellow card was one of the worst decisions of the season.

He wrote on Sunday: 'Mike Jones, often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees, made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed Jose Fonte wipe Sergio Aguero out for a stonewall penalty.

'As if that was not bad enough Jones then rubbed salt in the wound by showing Aguerro a yellow card for diving! However, Manchester City won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that Jones made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human? Well I think it does.

'Firstly Aguero has a yellow card to his name that, however wrong, cannot be over turned. He could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions.

'Next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the Premier league statistics and be forever against Aguero’s record.'

Jones, who will take charge at the Hawthorns just over 48 hours after his controversial display on the south coast, will work underneath referee Chris Foy at in Sunday's lunchtime kick-off at Upton Park.
