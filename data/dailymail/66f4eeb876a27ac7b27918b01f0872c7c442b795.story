Chesterfield FC defender Georg Margreitter's unusual surname has earned him free pizza for the rest of the season courtesy of Domino's.

The Wolves loanee had already been nicknamed 'Pizza' by fans and teammates alike, despite the differences in spelling between his name and the tomato, mozzarella and basil classic.

The 25-year-old Austrian says it's the first time his 'Pizza' nickname has ever paid off

His local branch of Domino's even invited the Austrian to try his hand at making a few slices ahead of his team's League One derby clash with Sheffield United on Saturday.

The 25-year-old said: 'The pizza nickname has always come with the territory, but this is the first time it’s paid off! 

'With such a high intensity training programme it’s great to be able to treat myself and get the energy levels back up'.

Margreitter is currently on loan from Wolves after spending last season with FC Copenhagen 

Margreitter arrived at Chesterfield from Wolves where he fell out of favour with manager Kenny Jackett and spent most of last season at FC Copenhagen. 

At the time, Chesterfield manager Paul Cook told the club’s website: ‘Georg’s career in English football has never really got going, for one reason or another. 

'But he had successful spells in Austria and Denmark and we believe he’ll be a useful addition to the squad.’
