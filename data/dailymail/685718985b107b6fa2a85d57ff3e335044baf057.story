Tragedy: Daisy Holmes, 16, sent a Facebook message to her on-off boyfriend hours before she was found hanged

A teenager described as a 'victim from birth' died hours after sending a message to her boyfriend telling him: 'this will be the last time I bother you', an inquest has heard.

Daisy Holmes, 16, sent the Facebook note on November 16 last year, hours before she wasÂ  found hanged at her flat in Hull, East Yorkshire.

The city's coroner's court heard the teenager had a history of self-harming and had tried to kill herself the previous year.

Her adoptive family say her problems began when her biological father met up with her but called her the wrong name.

Daisy's adopted parents, Carol and Ann Holmes, now want more work to be done to help young people suffering with depression and suicidal thoughts.

Speaking after the hearing, Carol said: 'We want children to be able to talk to each other about their thoughts and feelings and get them out in the open.

'Suicide is a very taboo subject and we want there to be more awareness.'

Daisy was adopted by the Hull couple when she was ten after suffering years of abuse and neglect.

She kept in touch with her birth parents but when her father turned up to see her drunk and called her the wrong name - something her boyfriend Jamie West said had caused her to self-harm.

At the time of her death, Daisy was living at the Kingston Project after relations with her adopted parents had broken down.

Her social worker Angela Smerdon told the inquest in Hull the teenager had been upset because Jamie had been seeing another girl.

Mrs Smerdon said: 'Daisy said she was angry with Jamie and felt let down by everyone.

'I told her she deserved a good life and should try to concentrate on positive things.

'I didn't think she intended on taking her own life.'

Health visitor Michael Falk also met Daisy five days before her death when she told him she had suicidal thoughts once every other week. Mr Falk arranged a further meeting with Daisy the following week.

Final message: The teenager messaged her partner to say: 'This 
will be the last time I bother you' and was found hanged at home

On the evening of her death, Daisy had returned to her flat after a trip into the city centre to meet Jamie.

He said: 'We met at the bus station and that was the last time I saw her.

'She seemed fine, she was happy we were back together - there was nothing to suggest she would take her own life.'

Starting his shift at 9pm that evening, friend Luke Baldwin went to check on the teen and found her dead.

Her adoptive mother said in a statement Daisy had been a 'victim since birth, who had a challenging relationship with her boyfriend, tensions with us, difficulties relating to professionals and disappointment over her career plans'.

The parents added: 'Daisy was proud to be an Army cadet and dreamed of becoming a medic in the Army.

'She was renowned for her sense of humour and ability to make people smile.

'We are proud that Daisy touched the lives of so many people she came into contact with; people who have shared with us the endearing impression she has left.

'We have been overwhelmed and greatly comforted by the love and support from all.'

The inquest into Daisy's death resumed today when assistant coroner Rosemary Baxter is expected to return her verdict.
