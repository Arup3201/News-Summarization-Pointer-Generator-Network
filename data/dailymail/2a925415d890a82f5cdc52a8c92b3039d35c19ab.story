Though she might look in the family way, Cara Delevingne fans needn’t freak out just yet.

The 21-year-old model has been snapped posing with a faux pregnant belly to model her cousin’s line of maternity wear 'In Pig'.

Cara cheekily cradled her ‘bump’ and joked around as she pulled faces while pointing at it, with her beloved pet rabbit Cecil poking out of her pocket. 

Cara Delevingne modeled In Pig vintage-inspired maternity dungarees in what appears to be a hotel room

The model looked a little sleepy but seemed to be enjoying having a bump, and of course posing with her beloved pet rabbit Cecil, who sat patiently in her pocket

The waif-like model seemed to be naked under a pair of bright blue dungarees with oversized white buttons and appeared to be wearing no makeup with her hair loose and untamed.

Just in case you're in any doubt about it, Cara confirmed to the Telegraph that she was not expecting.

The model, who recently returned from Marrakech where she helped celebrate her older sister Poppy’s second wedding ceremony, said: ‘My only baby is Cecil.’

Cara’s cousin, and the designer behind In Pig, which creates elegant vintage-inspired maternity wear, Edwina Gieve seemed delighted to have her famous relative endorse her product, saying: ’Cara looks fantastic in our dungarees, one of In Pig's bestsellers.

‘Cecil, the rabbit may be her only baby, but Cara proves our clothes can be worn with or without a bump.’

BFFs Suki Waterhouse (L) and Cara Delevingne (R) were pictured putting on an amorous display as they cosied up in a hotel lobby at the Cannes Film Festival last month

Rumoured to be newly single since a reported split with actress Michelle Rodriguez, Cara is certainly not acting like starting a family is on her mind right now.

She was seen out partying at the recent Cannes film festival with best friend and fellow model Suki Waterhouse.

Cara and Suki have been spending a lot of time together lately and carried on the high jinks in London over the weekend, where they had a girls' night out with some of their other famous pals.

Making it a night to remember, Cara posted a photo of herself with Suki, model pal Mary Charteris, Selena Gomez, Georgia May Jagger and Katy Perry.
