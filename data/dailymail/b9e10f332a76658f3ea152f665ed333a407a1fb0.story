The number of people abandoning Russia has shot up to its highest level in 15 years.

More than 200,000 Russians emigrated in the first eight months of this year - continuing a 'brain drain' which has been apparent since Vladimir Putin was re-elected as President in 2012.

It has caused shockwaves among analysts because until then, the number of people leaving Russia had been declining for 20 years following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

At the peak of Russia's 'first brain drain' from 1990 to 1992, when the country lay in turmoil as it converted to capitalism, more than 2million people left permanently to live abroad.

Slowly but surely the figure began to fall, and finally dropped below 100,000 per year in 2003.

By 2011 just 36,000 people were leaving Russia every year - and for every departure, ten people were arriving from nations such as Uzbekistan and Armenia.

Yet in 2012, the year President Putin won his third Presidential term, that number suddenly spiked to 122,751, according to official figures by Russia's Federal State Statistics Service.

It rose again to 186,382 in 2013 and reached 203,659 in the first eight months of 2014 - a period in which Russia has annexed Crimea and increasingly flexed its muscle on the world stage. 

Today that figure threatened to rise even further as the Kremlin said Russia will fall into recession next year - an announcement which forced the rouble to a record low against the dollar.

Controversial: The stark increase has happened since Vladimir Putin won his third term as President in 2012 

Russia's economic development ministry revised its GDP forecast for next year from a 1.2 per cent growth to a 0.8 per cent drop.

It is a blow for an economy which has been hit by Western sanctions and the plunging rates it can get for its oil exports.

The rouble has already dropped by more than 40 per cent this year - hitting an all-time low of 53.97 to the dollar - and disposable income for Russian families is expected to fall almost 3 per cent in 2015. 

But there are other reasons for migration.

Many of those leaving have included prominent journalists and intellectuals who say they feel threatened for opposing Putin in an ever-increasing crackdown on dissent.

Former world chess champion and political opponent Garry Kasparov, economist Sergei Guriyev and the founder of the 'Russian Facebook' Pavel Durov have all fled to live elsewhere.

Some are gay people who say they are persecuted amid a rise of religious fervour, homophobic attacks and a law against 'gay propaganda' which was signed last year. 

The number of gay Russians seeking asylum in the U.S. rose from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 between January and October this year.

In total around 40,000 Russians applied for asylum across the world in 2013, 76 per cent more than in 2012, according to a United Nations report.

Others came under pressure because of the way they reported the Ukraine crisis.

Alexander Shchetinin, the founder of the Novy Region news agency, has since fled to Kiev and intends to renounce his Russian citizenship because of 'bias' on Russian state TV. 

He wrote in a Ukrainian magazine: 'The more I watched the more I became convinced that nothing can be remedied here.

'It will take generations to cleanse people's souls of the effects of this radioactive TV.'

Desperation: Scores of people have contacted genealogist Vladimir Paley (pictured) in a bid to prove a claim to another country. 'They are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it,' he said

Another wealthy Moscow businessman interviewed by Vocactiv said he was desperate to leave.

'I want my children to grow up in a fairer country, one where the rule of law is more or less observed,' he said.

'I used to think it was possible to build a better society in Russia, but I’ve basically lost all hope now. It’s time to leave.'

Russian genealogist Vladimir Paley told in July how he was beset by requests from wealthy clients - who wanted to prove they were eligible for citizenship in another country.

'They are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it,' he said.

The spike in departures comes despite the majority of Russians agreeing with Putin, whose poll ratings are considerably higher than most of the western leaders he combats on the world stage.

Russian singer Tatiana Konkova said that was exactly the reason so many of the remaining minority were voting with their feet.

'I don't share the opinion of 90 per cent of the country,' she told Reuters earlier this year. 'I feel like a foreigner here now.'

Yet Russia is still a dream destination for hundreds of thousands of people across eastern Europe.

That means even with the recent exodus, 300,000 more people are arriving in Russia every year than the number who leave.

The most arrivals come from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan - as well as Ukraine, which more than 58,000 people fled to live in Russia between January and August this year.

Such is the appeal that Russia hosted the second-largest number of international migrants of any country in the world last year, according to the UN.

The figure was beaten only by the U.S. - though it was followed closely by Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Britain.
