A game show contestant has been taken to task on social media after fumbling a question on national television.

Jake Sanders, a medicine student from Deakin University in Geelong Victoria, made the slip up last night on Channel Nine’s Millionaire Hot Seat.

Mr Sanders was asked to choose from which four iconic film series the character Bobba Fett-a bounty hunter from Star Wars-features in.

It comes after a Victorian teacher made international news in December by botching the opening question on the same program.

Whitney Beseler, a PE teacher from Balllarat in Victoria,was asked which of the following-an engagement ring, an anniversary ring, a wedding ring or a burger ring- was 'not a piece of jewellery worn to symbolise a relationship between two people.'

Vision of Beseler assuredly locking in ‘anniversary ring’-suggesting that burger rings were a form of romantic jewellery-went viral, reaching mainstream media outlets in all corners of the globe.
