Japan's response to the nuclear crisis that followed a violent tsunami was utterly confused, a report claimed today.

Bumbling government employees and relief workers made a catalogue of errors during the disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, the 500-page document concluded.

It said authorities had grossly underestimated tsunami risks, assuming the highest wave would be six metres (20 feet), when they in fact hit more than double those levels.

Disastrous mistakes: Government employees have been fiercely criticised by a report for being unprepared and disorganised ahead of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant explosion

Workers at Tokyo 
Electric Power Company, which ran Fukushima Dai-ichi, were 
untrained to handle emergencies such as the power shutdown that struck when
the tsunami destroyed backup generators, it said.

All these mistakes contributed to the world's worst
nuclear disaster since Chernobyl on March 11, said the damning report.

The report, which is set to be completed
by 2012, attacked the Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. for the mistaken assumption an emergency cooling system 
was working and a delay in disclosing dangerous radiation leaks.

It criticised the authorities for further delays in publicising the dangers and describing the situation using the word 'soteigai', meaning 'outside 
our imagination', which it said implied they were shirking 
responsibility for what had happened.

National tragedy: The report painted a disturbing picture of the errors made by workers at Tokyo Electric Power Co. and by government officials

Life-threatening issues: Authorities underestimated the tsunami risks and wrongly assumed a cooling system was working

'This accident has taught us an important lesson on how we must be ready for soteigai,' it added.

It said that by labelling the events as 
beyond what could have been expected, officials had invited public 
distrust.

There was no clear manual to follow, and the workers failed to communicate, not only with the government but also among themselves, it said.

Finding alternative ways to bring sorely needed water to the reactors was delayed for hours because of the mishandling of an emergency cooling system, the report said.

Workers assumed the system was working, despite several warning signs it had failed and was sending the nuclear core into meltdown.

The report acknowledged that even if the system had kicked in properly, the tsunami damage might have been so great meltdowns would have happened anyway.

But a better response might have reduced the core damage, radiation leaks and the hydrogen explosions that followed at two reactors and sent plumes of radiation into the air, according to the report.

More worrying still was how the government delayed in sharing vital information with the public and used evasive language to avoid admitting serious meltdowns at the reactors, the report said.

Dangerous delays: Officials were too slow in revealing the extent of the radiation leaks during the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, said the report

The government did not release radiation data fast enough in the area, the report found, unnecessarily exposing towns to radiation when they could have evacuated.

The government has norecommended changes so utilities will respond properly to serious accidents.

It recommended separating the nuclear regulators from the unit that promotes atomic energy, echoing frequent criticism since the disaster.

Japan's nuclear regulators were in the same ministry that promotes the industry, but they are being moved to the environment ministry next year to ensure more independence.

The report did not advocate a move away from nuclear power but recommended adding more knowledgeable experts, including those who would have been able to assess tsunami risks, and laying out an adequate response plan to what it called 'a severe accident'.

The report acknowledged people were still living in fear of radiation spewed into the air and water, as well as radiation in the food they eat.

Thousands have been forced to evacuate and have suffered monetary damage from radiation contamination, it said, and the earthquake and tsunami left 20,000 people dead or missing.

'The nuclear disaster is far from over,' the report said.
