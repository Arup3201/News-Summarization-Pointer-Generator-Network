A loophole on no-frills airline easyJet’s website could save parents hundreds of pounds.

The company has a deal called Flexi fare in which customers can buy a ticket for one date and then change it to another free of charge.

So parents could buy cheaper tickets for dates in term time and then swap to much more expensive school holiday times.

Loophole: easyJet has a deal called Flexi fare in which customers can buy a ticket for one date and then change it to another free of charge

Tickets must be bought for three weeks before or one week after the day that they want and then wait a nerve-wracking 24 hours before they can make the change, reports The Sun.

Flexi fare is aimed at businessmen, however, it is not without a risk as the new date could be sold out in the 24-hour waiting period. The fares are also more expensive than regular tickets.

EasyJet is aware of the dodge but commented: ‘There is no guarantee of availability on alternative dates.’
