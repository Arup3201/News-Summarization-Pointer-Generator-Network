Tragic: Jacqueline Ann Whitehead spent 15 hours immobilised after falling at her home. She was rushed to Royal Bolton Hospital where she later died

A pensioner died after trapping her leg in a stairlift on the way to get a cup of tea.

Jacqueline Ann Whitehead, 73, lay helpless for 15 hours before she was found at home in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The pressure caused rapid muscle breakdown and she died in Royal Bolton Hospital shortly before midnight on 11 June.

Despite using the stairflift to get up the stairs, it is thought Mrs Whitehead then decided to go back down for a cup of tea, and as she attempted to get out of the seat, she slipped and trapped her leg.

She developed metabolic acidosis, caused by intense pressure and rapid breathing.

An inquest into Mrs Whitehead's death at Bolton Coroner's Court ruled the stairlift was working before the incident.

Alan Walsh, deputy coroner for Bolton, said: 'The stairlift appeared to be working as it took Mrs Whitehead up the stairs just before she fell.

'There had been an inspection of the machine in February and between them and the day of the incident the company had received no reports of malfunctioning.'

Mr Walsh recorded a verdict of death as a result of an accident.

He said: 'I am enormously sad that Jacqueline died in these circumstances in what was a horrendous experience being trapped for between 12 and 15 hours.

'She was a strong, resilient, independent lady and I am very sorry for the family that she should die like that.'

The widow, whose husband and business partner William died in 2005, began to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and mobility issues in the last few years.

Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Whitehead’s brother Peter Jackson, said he grew closer to his sister as he helped her get around: 'Jacqueline and her husband William had both run successful businesses in the past, a butchers and a dress shop in Harwood.

'They enjoyed their life together, travelling and playing golf.

'We became more in contact than we had before and because she was unsteady on her feet she was a bit more dependent on me at times.'

Harwood Golf Club in Bolton where Jacqueline Ann Whitehead had been a member, captain and president

Tributes flooded in for the former dress shop owner and golf club president.

David Johnson, secretary of Harwood Golf Club, said: “Jackie is, and will continue to be a very much missed member of the golf club.

'Both she and her husband Bill participated widely in the club and devoted much of their time to being here.'

Jackie became lady captain of Harwood Golf Club in 1984, three years before her husband was handed the position. In 2010, she took on the presidency herself.

'They lived in a cottage just behind the club, and they enjoyed being here very much.' Mr Johnson added.

'Even after Bill’s death, and with Jackie’s trouble getting around, she was a very social member and she would still come and meet the ladies and they would have lunch together.

'She will certainly be much missed by all at Harwood Golf Club, and we offer our condolences to her family.'
