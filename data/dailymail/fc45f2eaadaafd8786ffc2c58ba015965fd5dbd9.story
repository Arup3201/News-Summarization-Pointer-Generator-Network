A bus driver kicked a two-year-old girl and her mother off a bus because the child's crying had given him a headache.

Paryss Walter, 22, was heading home with her little daughter, Lillie, when the youngster became upset.

But as the shop assistant tried to calm her daughter down, the bus driver turned round and swore at them and ordered them to get off.

Shock: Paryss Walter, 22, said she is now scared of getting on buses after she was ordered off because her daughter Lillie was crying

The mother protested and other passengers on the bus in Walton, Suffolk, said they did not have a problem with the young girl.

However, Paryss claimed the driver became more aggressive so she got off the bus with her daughter in the dark - even though others said she was within her rights to stay on.

She made an official complaint and the worker has now been ordered to go on a customer service re-training course.

But the company was unable to tell the 
aggrieved mother whether there was any other disciplinary action taken 
because of employee confidentiality.

Bus trouble: Paryss, 22, said her daughter was having a tantrum on the bus - but she was shocked to be ordered off

Paryss was left in tears following the incident and she said she is now frightened of getting back on the bus.

'The driver stopped the bus and turned round and said "that's it - I have got a headache - I have had enough. Get off my f****** bus".

'He was raging and it was totally disproportionate to what was happening - I was so shocked and I could not believe it. I was going to get off but it was the other passengers who told me not to be silly, that I had nothing to be ashamed of.'

The mother said her daughter had been having a tantrum but said the driver's response was 'totally over the top'.

She added: 'Lillie is two years old and like many children of her age she does sometimes cry and get upset and can scream.

'I told the driver that I was within my rights to stay on the bus, but then he started to make his way towards me, so I left at that point as I was starting to worry about what he would do to me and my daughter.

'When I got off I realised I was shaking in fear and then I burst into tears. It was dark outside and I did not want to walk home as it was a good 10 minutes from where I live and it is not well lit and of course I had Lillie with me.

'It was freezing cold, it was dark and I was scared because it was pitch black - I could not believe what was happening to us.'

Paryss, who had been to visit her mother, suffers from  panic attacks and has a weak heart which she had surgery on when she was a child.

The mother was planning to walk home but went into a coffee shop to steady her nerves after the incident at about 5.50pm.

A kindly customer could see that she was so upset that he drove her and Lillie the remainder of their journey home.

First Bus said to her in a letter following the incident on February 21 that they had taken action against the driver.

Proud mother: Paryss was returning from visiting her own mother when she was ordered off the bus in Walton, Suffolk

A letter from the customer services department said: 'Due to employee confidentiality, I am unable to discuss the form of action that has been taken.

'However, it may have involved; retraining, monitoring, a disciplinary sanction or a combination of all three.

'The actions of our driver were not acceptable and were below the standards that First expect.'

A spokesman for First Bus said today : 'We received a complaint from this customer, regarding inappropriate behaviour from a driver on our 76 service.

'The driver has been identified and the disciplinary process is still ongoing.

'First take allegations of this nature extremely seriously, and the driver in question will be dealt with according to our company policy.'Â 

The bus company added that they had received no request for a refund or compensation.
