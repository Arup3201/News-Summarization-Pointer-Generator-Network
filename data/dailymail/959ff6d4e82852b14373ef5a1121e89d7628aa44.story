Organisers of the World Hen Racing Championship say they were stunned to find competitors using bizarre tactics in a bid to win the race.

The race, which takes place at the Barley Mow Inn in Bonsall in Derbyshire sees chickens compete over a 20 yard course in a tradition dating back over 100 years.

But with the race being completed in record times this year, organisers say people are taking to training their chickens, with contestants seen banging tins and garden forks, talking in strange tongues and even using a home-made tuning fork to egg the hens on.

Around 52 hens lined up for this year's event on Saturday, which saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend upon the village.

But rather than seeing a random chicken taking the title, it seemed as though the birds were being groomed for glory, with a new course record set, and even a photo finish at the end.

Now pub landlady and one of the organisers Colette Dewhurst reckoned this year's form showed the ancient tradition had entered a new era.

She said: 'It was great day which showed we have moved into the era of professional hen racing. People are quite clearly training the hens.

The winning hen was Road Runner, front, owned by Oliver Keely and trained by his ten-year-old brother Harvey

'We have a laugh about it. How do you get a hen to race? We thought it was a bit of fun.

'But this year there were five or six hens which have literally been trained to run to the other end.

'We had one girl tapping a tin which produced a high-pitched sound. She had lined it with tin foil and had a fork which was like a tuning key to make it stand out from the shaking of the tins everyone else had.

'It is a keen contest now with covert training methods.

'We also have people shouting in weird voices, placing buckets of fishing worms on the finish line and banging tins. It all seemed to work pretty well.'

This year's winning chicken was three-year-old Road Runner, owned by 13-year-old Oliver Keely, who keeps the bird as a pet at the bottom of his garden.

But it was Oliver's ten-year-old brother Harvey, who took the bird in hand and turned him into a champion.

Salesman dad Charlie, 35, also ensured the bird was on good form by placing a pot of meal worms on the finish line.

But at no one was quite sure which of the finalists was first past the post so there was stewards' inquiry.

However, Ms Dewhurst added: 'It was a photo finish which had to be replayed on a phone to see which chicken's foot crossed the line first.'

But Mr Keely never had any doubts explaining: 'Luckily it was wet. Our bird prefers wet going and soggy ground.'
