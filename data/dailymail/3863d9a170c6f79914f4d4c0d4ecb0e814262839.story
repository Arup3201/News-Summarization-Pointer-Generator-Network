Hearing: Jasbinder Boparan, pictured outside the High Court, is accused of profiting from her husband Michael's crimes

The wife of a fugitive crime lord who owned so many sports cars he was nicknamed 'Don Car-leone' has insisted that her husband does not give her money - even though she spends £17,000 a month.

Jasbiner Boparan, a former personal assistant, is fighting to stop her assets being frozen by officials who claim they are the proceeds of her husband Michael's crimes.

He is living in Dubai and is wanted by French police for allegedly running a Europe-wide criminal gang.

After he was arrested in 2010, detectives in Britain and Switzerland seized £4million worth of supercars from his collection, including two Bugatti Veyrons, four Ferraris, three Rolls-Royces and two Porsches.

They found one Rolls-Royce dumped in a carpark at Stansted airport, while other vehicles owned by Boparan, 47, contained £750,000 in cash.

The gang lord, also known as Alexander Surin, bragged about his collection on forums like Pistonheads and Ferrari Chat using the screen name 'Icemanbops'.

Ever since going on the run, he has apparently been living in Dubai's exclusive Emirate Hills gated community, where rents start at £1,500 per month and houses can cost as much as £7million.

Mrs Boparan appeared at the High Court yesterday to defend herself against the National Crime Agency, which is attempting to freeze her assets.

She says she is living in 'very difficult times' despite spending £17,000 per month and living in a street in St John's Wood, North-West London, where properties cost an average of £1.5million.

She told the court her lifestyle was financed by her brother, who owns a hotel in Canada, and said she had not received financing from her husband either directly or 'through third parties'.

The NCA claims that Mrs Boparan 'is in fact the joint recipient of the proceeds of unlawful conduct, mainly of her husband'.

Jonathan Hall, acting for the agency,
asked her if she was aware her husband had secured loans against the 
properties in question.

'I think that is for him to answer,' she said. 'No, I did not know. I would have been absolutely furious.'

Mrs Boparan said that she owed £130,000 to her family after borrowing from them to keep up with her spending.

'It is all a bit convenient for you', Mr Hall said. 'You claim you have no assets but when push comes to shove the assets are made available to you.'

He suggested that her funds all came from her husband but had been 'disguised in some way', which she denied.

Judge Higgins indicated he will reserve judgement to a later date.

Mr Boparan was jailed for five years in 1996 over a £1.3million bank swindle after he and his gang forged bank cards and plundered more than 800 accounts, spending the proceeds on fast cars, expensive holidays and hostess bars.

He was later found guilty of involvement in a huge customs fraud, but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal thanks to errors by the prosecution.

At the time, Lord Justice Longmore said, 'This is a melancholy result. The court is compelled to allow the appeals, even in the case of one man who pleaded guilty.'

Judge Higgins has indicated he will reserve judgement to a later date.
