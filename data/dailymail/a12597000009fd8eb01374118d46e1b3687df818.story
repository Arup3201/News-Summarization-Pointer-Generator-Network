Keep your winter coat in the wardrobe for a few more days - because the warm weather is set to last a little longer across many parts of Britain.

Temperatures last week reached 20C, and the Met Office has predicted the mercury will hit 19C today and tomorrow in the South and East of England.

North-east England can also expect maximum temperatures of 19C, while eastern Scotland is set for 18C. The UK average for this time of year is 12.8C.

It comes as stags were pictured this morning bellowing loudly to signal the start of the mating season in Richmond Park in south-west London.

The red deer were searching for a female. They competed to be the loudest stag on show but left empty handed as no doe turned up to see them.

It is expected to be dry today in 
southern and eastern parts today and tomorrow, with a chance of rain in 
the North and the West.

Emma
 Corrigan, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘In the past week we've
 seen temperatures consistently of about 20C in terms of maximums.

‘Even though we've seen heavy rain it's been warmer than average, mostly in the south. That is due to the wind direction.’

She
 added: ‘From midweek onwards it's a cooling period - a marked dip in 
temperature due to a cooling wind, and it will be more towards the 
average.’

Her comments come 
days after a beautiful double rainbow appeared in Grimsby, Lincolnshire,
 last Friday afternoon - following heavy showers.

The rare weather phenomenon happens when sunlight is reflected twice inside the raindrops at an angle of 50 to 53 degrees.

Forecast: Temperatures last week reached 20C, and the Met Office has predicted the mercury will hit 19C today and tomorrow in the South and East of England

The Met Office said the dry sunshine 
at the start of this week has been caused by high pressure and air 
coming in from the south.

Gardeners
 revealed some late-blooming plants are making a surprise appearance 
well after the time when they would normally disappear until next year.

The highest temperature ever recorded in October in the UK was 29.9C on the first of the month in Gravesend, Kent in 2011.

But
 sadly, forecasters have warned that a late heatwave is not on the cards
 this week, with cloud and rain already a possibility in some areas.

On
 Saturday the highest temperature recorded was 20.1C in Thorney Island, 
Sussex.  Yesterday, 20.2C was recorded in Essex in mid-afternoon.

It
 has come as a welcome relief after much of the country was battered by 
rain and wind last week, with the colder weather marking a rapid shift 
from the bright, dry days of September.

Heavy rain on Thursday triggered yellow warnings for floods and severe weather in some parts of the country.

The
 warm temperatures came as a survey found the first decent British 
summer for seven years prompted many holidaymakers to delay their main 
vacation until the autumn.

Almost
 a fifth of holidaymakers said they were going away in October for the 
first time, the poll by foreign exchange company Travelex revealed.

Of
 those who took breaks in Britain this summer, around 30 per cent 
visited south west England, while other popular spots included Scotland,
 the Lake District and the Isle of Wight.

Overall, around 60 per cent chose a UK holiday this summer, with many deciding to vacation at home due to the good weather.
