Are the Obamas heading for the Golden State when they hand back the keys to 1600 Pennslvania Avenue?

According to gossiping realtors in California's Coachella Valley, the President and wife Michelle are buying a $4.25million modern home in a gated community in Rancho Mirage which once counted Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby as residents.

The Obamas are believed to be in escrow for the four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom home which has sweeping hilltop views, a gym, pool, 20ft waterfall and putting green.

Fit for a president? Obama and wife Michelle are reportedly in escrow for this $4.25million home in Rancho Mirage, California - although White House have denied reports

The hot property news, revealed by the LA Times, has been denied by the White House.

It is being sold by Marc Lange and Carl Blea with HOM-Sotheby's international realty.

The 8,000-square-foot home, which is nestled in three acres, was built in the early Nineties. Along with the lavish main home, there is a second home, called a 'casita' with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. 

Other features include a rock lagoon and two spas.

The property previously sold ten years ago and was placed on the market at one stage for $12.5million, according to the LA Times.

The First Family have spent numerous breaks in California throughout their time in the White House. In February, the President had a golf weekend with his childhood friends at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage.

The Obamas also own a home in Chicago.

The President is currently taking part in a fundraising drive on the West Coast. Obama flies to fundraisers fro Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

There, he will attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for Wednesday night and Thursday and will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.

President Obama, Michelle and Malia enjoyed a four-day weekend in southern California in June, staying at a private residence inside the gated community of Thunderbird Heights, in Rancho Mirage.

Sasha Obama is not believed to have been on the weekend trip, which was expected to include golfing and perhaps some house-hunting for the Obamas, it was reported at the time. 

Malia Obama has also recently spent time in California where she worked as a runner on the set of Halle Berry's upcoming sci-fi series Extant in Hollywood.

The White House has denied rumors from Californian realtors that the Obamas are in escrow over a $4.25million property in the state
