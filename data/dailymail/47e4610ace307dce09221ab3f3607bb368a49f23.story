A portrait bought nearly a century ago for just £70 could earn its owner a small fortune after being revealed as a missing masterpiece.

The 1909 painting called Summer Idleness: Day Dreams by the celebrated but tragic artist John William Godward, fetched the relatively paltry sum of £70 when it went under the hammer at Christie's in London in 1937.

At today's prices the £70 outlay is equivalent to £3,889 but experts believe the striking image of a woman resting on a marble chair could go under the hammer for between £150,000 and £200,000.

Entitled Summer Idleness: Day Dreams, this picture by John William Godward is set to make between £150,00 and £200,000 when it goes under the hammer next month

After a short spell with London dealers 
Vicars Brothers, the picture found its way to Harrods from where it was 
purchased for £100 in 1957.

Scholars only knew of the picture from a 1910 print but now the painting on canvas, measuring, 20ins x 30ins is set to make nearly 3,000 times its original value when it is auctioned at Lawrences in Crewkerne, Somerset, on October 12.

It is being sold by the daughter of the woman who purchased it from the world famous department story 55 years ago.

'It’s a wonderful find,' Lawrences’ specialist, Richard Kay said.

'The owners knew that they owned a fine picture but had no idea that its whereabouts had been unknown for well over half a century.'

Dr. Vern Swanson, a Godward expert recently assessed the picture from a photograph and declared it to be a revelation, commenting that it is one of the most sensitively coloured paintings by Godward.

Godward led a turbulent life. He upset his middle class London family by pursuing a career in art rather than a more traditional profession.

He perfected a technique of painting gauzy fabrics, voluptuous feminine flesh and, in particular, an extraordinarily realistic rendering of marble that looks tangibly cold.

Mr Kay continued: 'He enjoyed great successes at The Royal Academy until abstraction and modernism began to replace traditional historical themes in the early 20th Century.

'Godward further horrified his parents by living with one of his alluring models and then, as the real world failed to match his own idealised artistic vision of it, he took his own life in 1922.'

Horrified yet again by such a scandalous death, Godward’s family cut his face out of all family photographs and then destroyed all his papers in disgust.

As recently as 1979 this picture would have been worth barely £5,000 but Godward’s prices have soared in recent years.

A very large work, A Fair Reflection made a record price of just under £900,000 in New York in May 2012.

Mr Kay added: 'The appeal of Godward’s work is not just his meticulous technique but his graceful compositions and the atmosphere of serene thoughtfulness.'As we ponder the girl’s idle imaginings we share a little of her contemplative ease.

'It is a mesmerizingly calm picture and it offers a beautiful point of stillness in a hectic world.'
