The full extent of the blue-chip hacking scandal may never be known, one of Scotland Yard’s leading detectives admitted yesterday.

Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said it is impossible to estimate how deep the murky trade in illicit personal information runs.

He said police are unlikely to name the companies and individuals who pay corrupt private investigators to hack, blag and steal sensitive data.

But he revealed that officers have questioned 31 people suspected of illegally invading the privacy of others.

Asked if the number was only the ‘tip of the iceberg’, Mr Briggs replied that police had no way of guessing an ‘unknown, unknown’.

‘Of the material that we hold, we are conducting a thorough investigation of that for computer hacking offences,’ he said.

‘There may be other people elsewhere committing these offences of which the police have no intelligence or evidence.’

Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency have been criticised over their response to the blue-chip hacking scandal.

The two crime-fighting bodies are accused of sitting on an incendiary list of 102 companies and individuals who hired rogue private eyes.

It is dominated by law firms, but also includes debt collectors, oil companies, venture capitalists, pharmaceutical firms and two celebrities.

The list was compiled in 2008 but Soca only released it to the Commons home affairs committee last month – and police are insisting it remains confidential.

MPs suspect that those on the list have been protected from public scrutiny over their actions because it remains secret.

They are concerned that they have not been investigated with the same vigour police show in pursuing journalists who broke the law to obtain private information.

Mr Briggs is responsible for Operation Tuleta, one of three inquiries set up in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal.

A team of 16 detectives and one civilian are investigating ‘criminal acts that intruded on individual privacy’. They are examining claims that private investigators were employed to steal personal information for corporate clients and individuals.

The other linked inquiries are Operations Weeting and Elveden, which are examining allegations of phone hacking and bribing public officials to obtain stories respectively.

Speaking yesterday, Mr Briggs said Tuleta detectives have arrested 20 suspects and interviewed 11 more under caution.

In one notorious case, a private eye is accused of using a virus to hack to the computer of former Army intelligence officer Ian Hurst.

Mr Briggs’s comments raise the prospect that police are unlikely to penetrate the wall of silence around the blue-chip hacking scandal.

Last month dozens of law firms refused to discuss if they used private investigators or what steps they take to ensure they do not break the law.

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said officers cannot demand answers from private eyes or others without information to suspect they have broken the law.

Speaking about Operation Tuleta yesterday, Mr Briggs said five further names were withheld from the 102 on the MPs’ list as they are under criminal inquiry. Officers have seized 100 computers and are examining a mass of digital material.
