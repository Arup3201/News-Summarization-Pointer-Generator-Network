Seven months after he was forced to sell the L.A. Clippers amid a racism scandal, Donald Sterling is still in a highly contentious lawsuit with the NBA. 

The 80-year-old real estate mogul has added his wife Rochelle (called Shelly) and two doctors to the $600 million lawsuit, according to the most recent filing last week. 

In this latest filing, Sterling's lawyers claim that Shelly and  two doctors worked 'secretly' with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to strip him of his team.

'Conspiracy': Former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling (right, in black) has added his wife Shelly (left, in white fur) to a $600million lawsuit, claiming she conspired to force the sale of the team last year. The Sterlings pictured above attended a Clippers game in March 2005

Claims: Sterling also mentioned his former girlfriend V Stiviano in the latest filings, claiming the recordings she taped of his racist rant was edited but provided no evidence. Stiviano pictured above walking around Los Angeles on August 5, 2014 

'The NBA and Silver isolated Rochelle from her husband and scared her into undertaking certain conduct hereinafter alleged, including the signing of papers ... that she did not understand,' the  complaint reads. 'All of this conduct constituted elder abuse.'

Silver, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, banned Sterling from the NBA for life last year and hit him with a $2.5 million fine after tapes were released of Sterling speaking racist slurs. 

The doctors mentioned in the suit, Dr Meril Platzer and Dr James Spar, evaluated Sterling last May and found him mentally unfit to continue controlling his family trust, which included the Clippers.

But Sterling claims that his wife Shelly 'fraudulently induced' and 'fraudulently arranged' the mental evaluations, and that the two doctors violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by releasing his medical records.

'[The defendants] colluded and worked toward a common goal in causing injury to Sterling's financial interests,' the complaint reads. 

Sterling also mentions V. Stiviano, his ex-girlfriend who recorded the tapes that exposed his racism. 

'Several of the statements on the recording were not made by Sterling,' the complaint reads. 'The statements alleged to be those of Sterling were apparently altered by Stiviano or her agents.'

It does not offer evidence as to how the tapes could have been edited. 

Furthermore, he claims that the release of these medical records, and the subsequent loss of his team caused him to suffer 'extreme mental distress...including worry, anxiety, anger, embarrassment, sleeplessness and fatigue.' 

Shelly's lawyer Stephen Smith told the Los Angeles Times that the recent filing was 'desperate and frivolous'.  

Sterling is asking for $600 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages. 

The NBA counter-sued Sterling last August, saying that Shelly's participation in the Clippers sale means that Sterling is effectively suing himself.  

Some $1billion from the record sale is currently being held in an escrow controlled by the NBA, in the event that Sterling is forced to pay out to the league, Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini explained.
