A sea of colour and celebration has erupted across the world as millions of worshippers gather to celebrate the end of fasting for Ramadan.

For the past month observant Muslims have refrained from eating or drinking anything from dawn to sunset in a show of spiritual devotion.

The festival of Eid al-Fitr - the 'breaking of the fast' -  is now being celebrated across the globe with devout Muslims meeting to exchange gifts, enjoy food and decorate their homes in a show of thanksgiving.

They will greet each other with the traditional Muslim greeting of Eid Mubarak, which translates roughly as 'Eid blessings' and is more or less equivalent to 'Merry Christmas'.

As well as the special prayers and celebrations, customs of Eid include dressing up in new clothes, eating special delicacies, giving presents and, for women, decoration of the hands with henna.

Jack Khan, a British-Bangladeshi 
Muslim, told MailOnline that some of the special dishes being passed 
round Eid tables may include shemai, a sweet made with vermicelli and 
milk, and fita, fried dough balls made with rice flour and drizzled with
ghee - which he described as 'delicious'.

For
those who can afford it in Bangladesh, there would also be lots of 
different types of roasted meat on offer, served with that perennial 
favourite, pilau rice.

Many will be feeling a sense of relief at the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting during which observant Muslims are encouraged not to eat or drink anything - even water - during the hours of daylight.

A time of spiritual reflection and increased worship, during the period Muslims are expected to pay more attention to the teachings of their religion, also refraining from sexual relations with their spouses as well as generally sinful behaviour.

It is believed to help teach devotees how to better practice self-discipline and sacrifice, but also inculcate empathy for those less fortunate than themselves and encourage generosity and charity.

Charity is also an important part of Eid. Mr Khan explained: 'I have to give a minimum of £5 per person in my family - which is the equivalent of a bag of rice.

'This time of year, because it's the New Year, a lot of people also give their Zakāt, which is 2.5 per cent of your wealth, irrelevant of much you earn.

'So my wife has to give 2.5 per cent of the value of all her jewellery, which she can either do by selling some of it... or I can pay for it.

'If you watch the Muslim TV channels you would have seen there has been a massive amount of fundraising going on over the past month.'

Millions of Muslims celebrated Eid across the world.

Thousands of Palestinian men performed the morning Eid Al-Fitr prayer in front of the Dome of Rock at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam's third most holy site, in the old city of Jerusalem.

While women gathered in Indonesia to mark the day.
