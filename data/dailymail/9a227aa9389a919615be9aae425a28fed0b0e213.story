Reunited: Edwina Currie with daughter Debbie

Spicing things up a bit is her speciality. So when Edwina Currie was sent into the celebrity jungle, she did exactly what was expected.

But it wasn’t her frank confessions about her love life that raised eyebrows (after all, she is the woman who told all about her affair with Prime Minister John Major).

It was her open admiration and flirtatious approach to the young men in the jungle that seemed to rile so many viewers.

Last night, back in her five-star hotel after being voted off I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, Miss Currie, 68, was unrepentant about her behaviour and the open way she discussed sex on the show.

Indeed she said it was precisely because of her age that she was happy to talk about it.

‘It may be a taboo subject for young people,’ she declared. ‘When you get to a certain age, you talk about it all the time. It’s one of the issues of the WI.’

Forget the Women’s Institute traditions of jam making, arts and crafts and even more modern pursuits such as learning to surf the internet. 

Miss Currie said what her generation really want is to talk about sex.

‘I am a baby boomer, for God’s sake. I was born in October 1946. My parents were married in January 1946.

'We were part of a generation who changed the world – and I think we changed it entirely for the better with issues like racism and sexism. Our generation of women are just about reaching our prime.’

Miss Currie’s flirtatious behaviour in the jungle involved ogling male campers as they worked out, in particular X Factor star Jake Quickenden, at whom she directed much of her attentions.

She marvelled at his muscles and toned figure as he lifted logs as weights. And the mother of two, who has written several racy novels, led discussions about sex and virginity while in the camp.

She happily spoke about her own sex life, going into detail about having one-night stands.

She justified herself by saying: ‘I don’t mind talking about what happened half a century ago.

‘If it enlightens and assists other people to overcome that extraordinary obstacle and gets them to a state of maturity and sexual awareness, I’m happy.’

However, she complained that other contestants’ stories might have been edited out of the programme. ‘We were all talking about losing our virginity,’ she said. ‘If the programme producers have only broadcast my remark, that is unfair. It was so long ago anyway.’

Miss Currie also offered sex tips to her camp-mate Nadia Forde. Asked what she told the singer, Miss Currie said she drew on advice from her late mother.

She said: ‘I probably just said, “Enjoy it while you can, love!” My mum made it to nearly 93.’
