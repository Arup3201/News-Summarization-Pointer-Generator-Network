Six people including a pregnant woman were airlifted to hospital yesterday after a fire on a ferry carrying hundreds of British holidaymakers.

Passengers on a crossing from Newcastle to Amsterdam complained of being ‘treated like animals’ as the DFDS vessel King Seaways returned to port.

Fights broke out as passengers were forced to cram on to outer decks for safety.

Two men were arrested in connection with the incident – a 26-year-old on suspicion of arson and a 28-year-old on suspicion of affray.

It is believed that the fire started in a cabin when a drinker dropped a lit cigarette on his bedding after falling asleep on Saturday night. 

RAF rescue helicopters were scrambled as crew members tackled the blaze and passengers were forced to evacuate their cabins.

Some children were left shivering outside without their shoes and socks as they had been sleeping when the alarm was raised and passengers complained of their treatment.

‘We were treated like animals on that boat,’ said Joe Hilton, 22, a sports student from Billingham, Co Durham. ‘I was traumatised, I haven’t slept all night. We didn’t get any food until about seven this morning.’

Chris Johnson, 27, an engineer from Rochdale, Lancashire, accused the crew of failing to keep passengers informed. ‘The staff wouldn’t tell us anything,’ he said. ‘I was panicking and so was my girlfriend.

‘It was quite scary, especially for the kids on board. It was really cold and everyone was crammed outside and they wouldn’t let us know what was going on.’

Julie Bell, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘It was like a scene from a movie – a chaotic mess, horrible. It was terrifying and I won’t be travelling by boat again.’

The six people who were airlifted – the pregnant woman, a man and four crew – were taken to Scarborough Hospital suffering what was believed to have been the effects of smoke inhalation and have since been discharged.

A further 17 people were treated by the ferry doctor.

Many of the 946 passengers had been planning to spend New Year in Amsterdam but have been forced to abandon their holidays after being taken back to Newcastle’s ferry port at North Shields.

They have been offered refunds for their ferry tickets, but it is unclear whether they will be entitled to further compensation for their ruined trips.

The fire broke out at 10.45pm on deck 5 while the ferry was about 30 miles off Flamborough Head in Yorkshire. Crew members extinguished it quickly but the captain decided to turn back as a precaution.

Witnesses said that when they first heard the emergency alarms, they thought it was a joke – with some even singing the theme tune to the Titanic.

But then staff began to tell people to get outside and congregate next to the lifeboats.

Karl McMurrough, 18, from  Sunderland, said: ‘We all got rushed on to the deck. There were helicopters, kids squealing, life jackets. They were telling us to keep calm but they weren’t giving us any information.’ 

Steven Basford, 28, from Northumberland, added: ‘The fire was on our floor but on the other side of the ship. When we climbed up to the communal area we could see the smoke. It wasn’t thick but it was definitely noticeable.

‘Obviously people had had a lot to drink. It’s a bit of a party boat. Two big blokes started brawling.’

Joanne Shutt, 25, a work placement coordinator from Middlesbrough, was travelling with her mother Carol Cottrell, 55, and  daughter Eleanor, four.

She said: ‘We were in the disco area when the alarm went off. We had to stand outside on deck for a while and you could smell the fire.’

The King Seaways arrived back at 4am, but passengers were kept for more than five hours before they were allowed off.

Last night, Northumbria Police   still could not say how the fire was started. Passenger Brett Chapman, 19, from Newcastle, said: ‘I’ve been told that it was a lad who fell asleep with a lit cigarette. His duvet caught fire.’ 

Gert Jakobsen, of DFDS Seaways, said: ‘We are very sorry for those passengers affected by the fire. We are looking at how we can help them.’
