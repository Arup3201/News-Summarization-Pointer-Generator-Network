These are the first shots of Mr and Mrs LeBron James enjoying married life.

Basketball's MVP and his long-term girlfriend Savannah Brinson stepped out from San Diego's Grand Del Mar hotel on Sunday, the morning after a lavish ceremony.

Radiant in white, the couple, who have two children together, looked fresh and spritely despite three days of partying to celebrate their nuptials.

Newly-wed Savannah kept up the bridal theme in a lace strapless jumpsuit with cascading curly hair.

Her husband followed in a crisp white T-shirt and trainers.

The high school sweethearts held their ceremony in the hotel's Capella Chapel at 4.30pm on Saturday - two days into their celebrations.

The 28-year-old multimillionaire announced his engagement to Savannah, mother of their two children, in January last year.

Guests, including James's teammate Dwayne Wade, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, were welcomed to the wedding on Friday, with a barbecue and the festivities are expected to last until a farewell brunch on Sunday.

Other guests included Wade's girlfriend Gabrielle Union, and NBA players Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony, according to People.

Hotel staff and pretty much everyone involved with the wedding were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, but the enormous marquee erected outside was an unavoidable hint at the vast scale of the event.

The extravaganza was organized by celebrity wedding planner Preston Bailey, who also oversaw internet entrepreneur Sean Parker’s $10 million ‘Lord of the Rings’-themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas back in June.

King James' big day was expected be a slightly more muted affair. The guest list was expected to only number in the hundreds, rather than the thousands that have attended some NBA All-Star’s nuptials.

‘He cut the list down because he didn’t want to have 1,000 people at the wedding,’ a source told the New York Post. This weekend’s wedding also clashes with Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.

Guests started receiving their ‘save the weekend’ cards, which featured an illustration of the happy couple along with their two kids, back in March.

The reception is expected to have included cocktails, dinner and dancing to DJs and a live band, as well as an after-party in a different part of the resort.

LeBron’s mom Gloria was be in attendance and was expected to take along her boyfriend Da Real Lambo, an obscure rapper who has posted a series of photos on Instagram of him enjoying the good life at LeBron’s expense on the family's recent European vacation.

Other guests included LeBron’s longtime manager Maverick Carter, New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony plus wife La La Anthony, Miami Heat president Pat Riley and head coach Erik Spoelstra.

The lovebirds, who live in an enormous $9 million mansion in Miami's Coconut Grove, have dated since high school and got engaged on New Years Eve 2011. They have two sons: LeBron Jr., 11, and Bryce, 6.

King James’ fiance has purposefully sought to shun the limelight for much of his career, but since their engagement was announced has started to engage more with the press and media.

In April she provided prom dresses for about 100 underprivileged girls in her current home of Miami and her hometown of Akron, Ohio.

'I can't imagine being in their situation and not have somebody help,' she said. 'I really care. It's really in my soul to help people, and this is the first baby to come from it. There comes a time when you have to give back.'

Her husband has encouraged his new wife to be as visible as she wants.

'I just think she has a knack for being powerful,' said James. 'Women are more powerful than men. Her voice and her being my sidekick, her voice is very powerful, especially to these young women who are underprivileged.'

Brinson admitted that there have been plenty of times when she has been bothered by attention, particularly when stories have come out that simply aren't true.

'I've heard things about me that are bad, where they've literally looked up into the sky and said, "What can they say about Savannah?" It's going to happen,' Brinson said.

'People will say I'm doing this for attention and now that I'm getting married, I'm coming out from behind his shadow, but I just thought it was time. I'm letting these girls know that I'm confident, showing them my personal growth, and maybe it will help them as well.'
