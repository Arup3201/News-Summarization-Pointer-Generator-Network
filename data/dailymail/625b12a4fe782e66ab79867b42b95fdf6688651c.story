It has proved controversial in Britain and has been banned outright in France but it seems the burka does have at least one high profile supporter - the Countess of Wessex.

'It’s very evident that Muslim women can be fashionable while also retaining their modesty,' said the 49-year-old in an interview ahead of her 50th birthday this month.

'And it's a great way of bringing people together, and saying, "Look, this is what we're really like".'

Modest: The Countess said the garment proves you 'don't have to show a lot of flesh to be beautiful'

The Countess, who was speaking in her role as patron of the London College of Fashion, made the comments in an interview with the January issue of fashion bible Harper's Bazaar, which along with the article on Sophie, features pieces on actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston.

It promises titbits on 'how I stay close to Chris' from Ms Paltrow and further features on new season fashion, which this year includes new ways to wear nautical and the return of culottes.

One item that isn't featured is the burka, although as the Countess goes on to say, most conceal a fashionable ensemble.

'What people forget is that underneath the burka and everything else, there is somebody who is probably wearing something really quite fashionable,' she added.

'It  proves you don’t have to show a lot of flesh in order to be beautiful and stylish.'

Her comments are likely to prove controversial thanks to the debate surrounding the burka, which some campaigners say should be banned in the UK as it is in France.

A Facebook campaign calling on the Government to ban the garment boasts 39,858 likes, while in July, a European Court of Human Rights ruling upheld France's burka ban on the grounds that it made it easier for different cultures to live together. 

Nevertheless, the debate about the garment, which covers a woman from head to foot and usually masks the face, continues to rumble on, with opponents describing it as being a means of oppressing the female wearer.

Schools have also questioned whether burkas should be allowed in classrooms with teachers saying that being unable to make eye contact pupils makes it harder to teach.

Some Muslim groups have also rounded on those who insist the garment must stay, pointing out that it is not required by the Qu'ran.

But opponents of a ban, among them Shami Chakrabarti, the director of human rights campaign group Liberty, say the debate is fuelled by racism and not women's rights.

Speaking to the Guardian following the European Court ruling, Ms Chakrabarti said the ban 'has nothing to do with gender equality and everything to do with rising racism in western Europe.

'How do you liberate women by criminalising their clothing? If you suspect bruises under a burqa, why punish the victim, and if you disapprove of the wearer's choices, how does banishing her from public engagement promote liberal attitudes?'

Other opponents of the French ban include Human Rights Watch and Open Societies, an organisation that promotes tolerance of people's religion and culture.
