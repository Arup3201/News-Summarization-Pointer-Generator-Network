A young woman is in excruciating pain after her experimental brain surgery went wrong and doctors are refusing to help her because the surgeon who performed the technique has retired.

Carissa Galvez, 20, had an experimental shunt put in her head to drain fluid from her brain five years ago and was happy and healthy until a fortnight ago when something went terribly wrong.

Now she writhes in pain and shakes involuntarily in a hospital bed at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona as doctors refuse to help her, no one quite sure how to remove the shunt safely.

Experiment gone wrong: Carissa Galvez had an experimental shunt put in her head but something has gone wrong, leaving her in excruciating pain with doctors refusing to help

Happier times: Miss Galvez had the surgery five years ago and up until two weeks ago she, pictured with her mother Daniella Galvez, was happy and healthy

The paediatric neurosurgeon that placed the experimental two-valve shunt when she was a teenager has since retired and for the moment nobody is able to reach him.

No doctor in Arizona has agreed to help Miss Galvez as the Banner Good Samaritan unsuccessfully appealed to other hospitals for help easing her pain.

Wants relief: Miss Galvez said the pain is really bad and she 'just wants five minutes of relief'

Out of reach: The paediatric neurosurgeon who performed the experimental surgery five years ago has since retired and no one seems to be able to contact him

Healthy smile: Miss Galvez, pictured with an unidentified friend, was studying to be a nurse until she started vomiting and getting a headache two weeks ago

Her mother Daniella Galvez told 3TV that her daughter’s condition was getting worse.

She said: ‘We basically have hit a roadblock, because it’s an experimental shunt. 

‘No other neurosurgeon here has dealt with this kind of shunt. They’re not familiar with it.’

Miss Galvez has a random genetic mutation that affects her cerebral spinal fluid, a bodily fluid which protects the brain. The two-valve shunt was to help drain the effected fluid.

She said from her hospital bed: ‘It hurts really bad. I just want five minutes of relief.

‘I just really want someone to fix it please.’

'Hit a roadblock': No doctor in Arizona has agreed to help remove Miss Galvez's shunt because no other neurosurgeon has dealt with the type of shunt. 'They're not familiar with it,' mother Mrs Galvez (pictured left with Miss Galvez in hospital)

Painful to watch: Her mother Mrs Galvez said nobody wants to see their child in pain as Miss Galvez clutches a medication pump and shakes involuntarily

Mrs Galvez said: ‘It’s horrible. I can’t explain it. 

‘To watch her shaking and know it’s because she’s in pain…it’s nothing anybody would want to watch their child go through.’

Up until two weeks ago, Miss Galvez was studying to be a nurse until she started to feel ill.

Mrs Galvez said: ‘She started vomiting a lot. She was getting a bad headache. Her blood pressure was high.’

A statement from the hospital read: ‘We are doing all we can to provide the best possible care for our patient Carissa, and her family, while we work to resolve this very difficult situation.’

Doing all they can: The Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center where Miss Galvez is admitted has been unsuccessfully appealing to doctors around the state for help
