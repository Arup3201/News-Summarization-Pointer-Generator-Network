A wheelchair-bound football fan has become the world’s first disabled coach in the able-bodied game after receiving a letter of praise from Sir Alex Ferguson.

Sohail Rehman, 21, was born with spinal muscular atrophy which left him struggled to walk a few steps, and by 13 he was in a wheelchair.

But a passionate football fan and player, he was determined not to let the condition push him out of the game.

Groundbreaking: Sohail Rehman, 21, refused to abandon the sport he loved when he was put in a wheelchair aged 13 suffering from spinal muscular atrophy

Career path: He is now a coach for Sunday league matches and tournaments in Yorkshire

Honour: Hearing about Mr Rehman's goals, Sir Alex Ferguson (right), former Manchester United manager, wrote to encourage him. The letter (pictured right) praises Mr Rehman's goals and fearlessness

He studied sports technology at college, and spent the rest of his time pitch-side - at school and at Old Trafford with the Manchester United disabled supporters association.

Two years ago, a letter arrived at his home in Keighley, near Leeds, from former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and it sealed his ambition.

Mr Rehman said: 'When the chance to play was taken away from me I think it was the only option I had really.

'I could watch the game but I always wanted to do more than watch it.

'I
 did it all the way up to college and then once I got to college they 
said to me you know so much about sports why don’t you do sports.

Mr Rehman admits he questioned his own ability to coach players as he cannot play the game himself

But he now believes his analysis is strong enough to get him into the Premier League

'I
 decided to take them up on that and do sports and then gradually 
through the sports development course at college I decided to take my FA
 badges and then basically got into it full time.

'I had a little bit of doubt before 
about coaching at that high level obviously having never played the 
game at a certain level, but when I got a letter from Sir Alex that 
was the final piece in the jigsaw.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement.

It occurs due to deterioration in the nerve cells (motor neurones) connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body’s muscles.

As the link between the nerves and muscles breaks down, the muscles that are used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up, and moving the head become progressively weaker and shrink (atrophy).

Mental abilities are unaffected by SMA.

The most common form is caused by a genetic problem where one copy of the genetic error is inherited from each parent.

'He congratulated me on my coaching badges and for the kind of goals I had in mind.

'It was a big honour, he is one of the biggest men in football.

'I’m going for it now, nothing will stop me.'

Starting his career, Mr Rehman will coach Sunday league teams and tournaments in Yorkshire but plans to rise to the top - with Manchester United in his sights.

He added: 'I don’t coach a professional team yet, its just Sunday league stuff at the moment.

'My dream job is probably to manage the biggest clubs in the world. I would want to manage.

'Any
 coach or manager who says he is just coaching Sunday League just for 
the fun of it is lying, because every coach want’s to coach at the 
highest level.

'That’s the way I am, I want to coach the Manchester Uniteds, the Real Madrids. That’s my aim.'

Mr Rehman, a Manchester United supporter, admitted he often questioned his own ability while training at Leeds City College.

He
 said: 'In the early stages you always have that question, how do you 
know when you’ve never played the game? But I think, in the end of the 
day, they have the right to ask that.

'I
 look at it like there are some managers out there who haven’t played 
the game, or they played the game at a low level not a high level, like 
Jose Mourinho.

'The other 
drawback is obviously I can’t demonstrate what I want to teach. I get 
fully into it though, I analyse want I want them to do and go into it 
with them.

'I always work 
round a problem and find a way of doing it. I probably am a lot more 
descriptive than other coaches, there is a lot more planning going into 
it really.

Mr Rehman, from Keighley, near Leeds, was born with spinal muscular atrophy, which breaks the connection between muscles and nerves

There are some practical problems like getting stuck in the mud but he doesn't mind

'There are some 
practical problems as well, you have a wheelchair and muddy pitches to 
deal with. That would stop any other person in a wheelchair, but not me.

'It gets stuck but I just dig it out and get on with it, you just get in the zone.

'Now I’ve been told I am the world’s first wheelchair bound football coach for an able bodied team.'
