An ex-convict has been charged in the killing of a 15-year-old girl after DNA tests linked him to her badly burned body that was found in an Indianapolis backyard in August, a prosecutor said Friday.

DNA found on Dominique Allen's sandals and body matched samples from 46-year-old William Gholston in the state inmate database, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said.

Investigators say Gholston snatched Allen from her sister's porch early on Aug. 21, according to WISHTV. 

Charged: William Gholston, 46,  of Indianapolis has been charged in the killing of 15-year-old Dominique Allen whose badly burned body was found in an Indianapolis backyard

Snatched: Allen was snatched from her sister's porch on Aug. 21, Gholston is then believed to have taken her to an abandon house

She was taken to an abandoned house then carried across a busy street before being burned and buried.

Investigators don't know of any connection between Allen and Gholston, who wasn't initially a suspect in the slaying, Curry said. A coroner determined that Allen was strangled to death.

Her body was found later that day by a man walking his dog, WISHTV reports, her body was badly burned, which police believed was done to get rid of any DNA evidence. 

'It was the DNA match in the database which brought Mr. Gholston's name to the attention of the detectives,' he said during a news conference.

Since the teen's murder, her family has been eager to find her killer. They even offered a $3,000 reward at the beginning of the month to anyone with information leading to an arrest in the case, IndyStar reports.

Gholston was released from prison in May after serving a sentence for 2006 convictions on illegal gun possession and resisting arrest charges. He previously served prison sentences for armed robbery and drug possession, according to Indiana Department of Correction records.

WISHTV reports that Gholston faced murder charges in 2002, but the charges were dropped when a key witness changed his story.

Curry said Gholston was arrested in the northeastern Indiana city of Bluffton this month for a parole violation.

Court records didn't list an attorney for Gholston and an initial court hearing on the murder charge wasn't immediately scheduled Friday.

Gholston told police investigators that he wasn't in Indianapolis in August and knew nothing about Allen's death, Curry said. The address Gholston gave for his parole was near where her body was found, but it wasn't clear when or whether he ever lived in the neighborhood..

The teen's purse and shoes were discovered about a block from where her body was found, according to police.

Several of Allen's relatives and friends held hands and prayed in a circle after the news conference announcing the charges.

Police are now investigating whether Gholston is connected to the murders of three other women who were strangled to death in Indianapolis, WISHTV reports. 

Edna Wilson was found strangled to death in October and Loy Ofsthun and Selese Goss were murdered in June.
