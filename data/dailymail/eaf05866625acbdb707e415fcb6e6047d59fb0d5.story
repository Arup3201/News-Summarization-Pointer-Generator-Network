A mother was shamed into losing six stone after she needed two wizard gowns to cover her body during a visit to the Harry Potter Studios.

Marie Hunter, 34, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, visited the studio in Watford, Hertfordshire, with her husband Dave, 33, and daughter Neve, seven, but there wasn't a wizard cloak big enough to fit around her size 24 figure when she posed for a fancy dress snap.

Two attendants had to help pin two cloaks to Marie's 20st 11lb body, and she was left feeling humiliated, saying: 'My daughter and husband looked so embarrassed and I was absolutely mortified.'

She had already found herself too big to squeeze inside the  famous blue car from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

Determined to return for a better photo opportunity, Marie went home after the incident in October 2012 and immediately set to work shedding the weight she had gained since giving birth to a stillborn son in 2008 and comfort eating through the grief.

She proudly returned to the studio last month with her family and niece, Dionne Bradley, 10,
 to show off her new size 14 figure.

Remembering the incident, Marie said: 'I decided to go for the first photo even though I was insecure.

'We queued for ages and when we finally got to put on the wizard robes, I said to a worker jokingly: "Have you got one big enough for me?".'

'He said yes of course, but came back and said he didn't.

'So he got two and pinned them together on my back in front of absolutely everybody in the queue and I had to put an arm in each robe with the spare arms hanging behind me.

'My daughter and husband looked so embarrassed and I was absolutely mortified. She hugged my leg and said 'mummy it's OK' but she had gone bright red.

'I smiled for the photograph but I wanted to cry. You could also get photos of you on a broomstick and I really wanted one done but I didn't because of how silly I'd look as such a large lady on such a small stick.

'It was just a horrible day that left me feeling anxious and upset.'

Marie said: 'I'm so much happier now, and I know it's made my family happier. My husband is very supportive and that's really helped'

Marie had always been overweight and as a child hid chocolate under her bed, but her weight really spiralled out of control after her son Luca was stillborn in 2008.

But in 2013 she lost 6st 4lbs in just over a year with the help of her local Slimming World group.

She added: 'I have just always been an emotional eater, but as I ate more I became more depressed.

'Losing Luca was so hard that I didn't even realise how big I was getting. I'm so glad I have finally lost all the weight. It felt so good to go back there and have none of the problems I experienced before.

'I'm so much happier now, and I know it's made my family happier. My husband is very supportive and that's really helped and he's obviously pleased that I can have days out without feeling embarrassed and insecure.

'My arthritis has also completely eased up which has made me more active.'

Marie, who joined her local slimming world in order to lose the weight, says her arthritis has cleared up since going on a diet
