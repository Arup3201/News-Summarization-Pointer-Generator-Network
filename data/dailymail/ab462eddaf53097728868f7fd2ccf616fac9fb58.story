If you've always liked the idea of a tattoo with your name on it, but never actually wanted to go under the needle, now is your chance to bring your inking dreams to life - by letting someone else do it instead. 

Illma Gore, 22, from Los Angeles, is offering her body as a blank canvas for strangers to fill with tattoos of their choice as part of a bizarre art project.

For donations of around £6, strangers can get their names tattooed on her body, while pledges of £60 and above give donors the chance to submit their own design.

Illma Gore,  22 from Los Angeles, is covering her entire body in tattoos suggested by total strangers

Miss Gore, who says her mission is to cover her entire body in inked art, launched her campaign on crowdfunding website Kickstarter a week ago and so far has gathered 469 backers, raising around £7,300.

She said: 'This idea has been playing on my mind for a while. I want the project to create a piece of priceless art.'

She said she is willing to have almost anything tattooed on her body, although there are certain exceptions.

She said: 'I wouldn't want a grape tattooed on me because in time it would wrinkle and become a raisin - no hate speech either.'

The artist, who had her first tattoo at age 15, has more than 40 designs on her body - including six on her face.

She said she will never look back with regret on getting any of her tattoos.

'My rule of thumb is never regret something that once made up the person that you are today.

'There is something absurd and beautiful about having an accumulation of absolute strangers name's draped over my pale goth skin.'

For around £6, strangers can have their names tattooed on Illma's body, for £60 they can submit a design

Her goal is to get at least 2,500 names tattooed on her - and she's not far off.

She said: 'I didn't expect the idea to become so popular on the internet. I love reading people's responses and requests. The weirdest request I've had so far is 'c*** beard'.

'I am still waiting for someone to suggest Wally.'
