The woman who was raped by two different men within the space of an hour had approached her second attacker pleading for help, prosecutors claim.

The 31-year-old victim was walking home from a bar in Brooklyn at 5am when she was allegedly attacked by Nicholas Isaac, 17 who is said to have threatened her with a gun before assaulting her.

She then walked 500 feet and approached Daquan Jackson, 21, in a desperate bid for support - but he told her 'I am going to do the same thing to you', before raping her as she begged him to stop, a court has heard, according to the New York Post.

Detained: Nicholas Isaac, 17, was arrested on Monday and charged in connection with the first of two sexual assaults on a woman in Brooklyn, New York, within the space of one hour

Police 
claim both attackers pushed the victim to the ground and threatened to 
shoot her if she did not comply, but neither produced a gun.

They also suspect the men were working together.

Isaac was arrested on Monday. Jackson was arrested today after CCTV footage allegedly showing an attacker leaving the scene was released.

Appearing 
before Brooklyn Criminal Court, Jackson's attorney claimed it is a case 
of mistaken identity - and branded the victim's account of being raped 
twice in an hour a 'delusional fantasy'.

He argued footage of the suspect walking away from the attack shows a taller man with lighter skin and a different hair style, New York Daily News reported.

The judge set Jackson's bail at $100,000.

The
 woman says the first suspect sexually assaulted her while threatening 
her with a gun, although he never displayed one, New York Post reported.

Attacked: The woman was attacked twice in one hour, and police managed to retreive CCTV from the second crime scene, showing the alleged attacker leaving

Investigation: Police believe that the two sexual assaults may have been coordinated by the two men

Violence: The two addresses where the assaults took place were just 528ft from each other

After
 the attack, the woman walked just over 500ft, where she was set upon by
 a second man, who also pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted 
her.

New
 York police have managed to retrieve CCTV surveillance video footage of
 the second suspect as he fled the scene in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, 
minutes after the attack.

‘Both
 incidents bear extreme similarities, so we aren’t ruling that out (that
 one suspect tipped off the other),’ a police source told New York Post.

‘The similarities (between both sexual assaults) are hard to ignore.’

The assaults took place at 5am and 6am on Sunday August 31st in Brooklyn, New York.

The first suspect is described as 5ft7in tall, wearing blue jeans and a red t-shirt.

The second suspect is a 6ft male, weighing approximately and 170lbs.
