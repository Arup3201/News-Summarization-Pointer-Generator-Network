The U.S. Army solider who used his helmet camera filmed a shocking firefight with the Taliban has finally been revealed - and he says he never meant for the footage to go public.

Private First Class Ted Daniels, 37, says he can no longer watch the video, which has been viewed on YouTube 23million times, because it is too painful to watch.

It also got him in trouble with his commanders, who called the dramatic cries for help after he was wounded served as a propaganda victory for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Too close for comfort: Dust kicked up by a bullet can be seen on the video, right near the soldier's feet as he descends the mountain

Pfc Daniels spoke to the Washington Post for the first time since the video went public in September and became an international sensation.

The three and a half minute video captures Pfc Daniels' peril as gunshots can be seen and heard all around him.

He fires several shots as he descends a mountain in an effort to draw fire away from his comrades.

As he makes his way down, bullets can
 be seen ricocheting by his feet - some coming dangerously close as he 
scrambles behind a rock for safety.

But as he crouches, the soldier drops his gun as a ricochet strikes his hand.

'I'm hit!' the soldier can be heard yelling repeatedly. 'Help me!'

His cries are not answered as shots continue to be heard.

In an interview with the Post, Pfc Daniels admitted that drawing himself into the open might not have been the smartest move.

'It wasn’t the most tactically brilliant thing to do,' he said.

Eventually, even though he was struck by shrapnel four times, he was able to climb back to the cover of a nearby armored vehicle.

Pfc Daniels said he never intended to publish the video for millions to see - he was online hoping to archive in a private YouTube account.

When he set the video to upload, the video hosting service estimated it would take one hour to process the raw footage and put it online. So he left for five hours.

In deep: As he screamed for help, shots continued to be fired in the direction of the injured soldier

When he returned, he had a message from YouTube user Funker530 waiting for him. The user, who has a channel that specializes in raw footage of combat, asked Pfc Daniels if he could use the video.

Two days later, after the clip been seen by hundreds of thousands of people around the world and been broadcast on CNN and the other major networks, his sergeant called him and demanded the video be taken down.

Military brass feared the the video - with Pfc Daniels' cries for help - could be used as propaganda by the Taliban.

He contacted Funker530 and asked him to remove the video. The user never got back to him.

The Washington Post reports that a video like Daniels' and all the traffic and subscribers it drew - could be worth $150,000 in ad revenue sharing for Funker30

Pfc Daniels said that he was part of a team on a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering mission when they encountered the Taliban fighters.

He said: ‘I got a hit a total of 4 
times. My helmet cam died and i made it down the mountain on my own. I 
was also hit in the side of my helmet and my eye pro was shot off of my 
face.'

Desperate: At one point in the video, his gun was knocked out of his hands by the force of one of the shots

Down, but not out: The soldier survived the assault after he said he was shot four times, but was not seriously injured

'The rest of the squad was pinned down by machine gun fire. I didn't start the video until a few minutes into the firefight for obvious reasons.

'I came out into the open to draw fire so my squad could get to safety.'

He said that one of the shots 'struck the tube by my hand of the 203 grenade launcher which knocked it out of my hands.'

'When I picked the rifle back up it was still functional but the grenade launcher tube had a nice sized 7.62 cal bullet hole in it and was rendered useless.'

The video was uploaded by YouTube user Funker530, which promises even more never-before-seen footage from the front lines of Afghanistan.

This footage is part of an ongoing project documenting of the war in Afghanistan.
