The RSPCA has warned it is struggling to cope with soaring levels of abuse and some of the worst cases of cruelty it has ever seen

The number of convictions for animal cruelty and neglect of pets has soared by more than a third last year to reach record levels, shocking new figures reveal.

The RSPCA has warned it is struggling to cope with soaring levels of abuse and some of the worst cases of cruelty it has ever seen.

In 2012, the charity rescued and collected almost 131,000 dogs, cats, horses, rabbits and other pets - a 10 per cent rise on the previous year.

Its inspectors investigated more than 150,000 cases of suspected cruelty and secured 4,184 convictions - 34 per cent more than 2011. Some 86 people were jailed.

The 'shocking catalogue of deliberate cruelty and neglect' includes:

The RSPCA's statistics show that dogs took the brunt of the abuse. However, there have been large rises in the mistreatment of horses, farm animals and hamsters and rabbits.

The charity said that the increase cannot be explained away by greater awareness of its work leading to more members of the public reporting concerns to it.

Gavin Grant called on judges to take the offences 'far more seriously'.

He added: 'The RSPCA is leading the fight against a growing animal cruelty crisis.

Left to die: Hope the dog, who was found abandoned in 2012 is just of the many cases the RSPCA has dealt with

'Our staff, volunteers and branches show tremendous dedication but they are struggling to keep up.

'For us, prosecution is always the last resort.

'However, if there is evidence of crime and serious animal abuse, then we will take legal action.'Â 

A spokesman for the charity added: 'It may cause surprise for some who think of the UK as a nation of animal lovers to see these figures indicating the opposite.

'Although our annual cruelty statistics highlight the worst cases we are involved with, it is worth remembering that there are millions of responsible, caring pet owners who look after their pets appropriately and the cruelty figures are very small in comparison.

'We must not, however, ignore the fact that there are some people out there who think it is acceptable to beat, kick, kill, starve or neglect an animal and these are the people we are trying to re-educate and, if necessary, prosecute.'
