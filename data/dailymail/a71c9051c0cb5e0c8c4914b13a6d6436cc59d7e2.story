With unflattering grimaces, pinprick eyes and over-sized hands, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are barely recognizable as they appear cast in Play-Doh.

The modeling brand sculpted the royal couple as part of its 2013 'Year In Review' project and looked back at the birth of their first baby together this July.

The doughy depiction of the new parents shows them stood on a balcony of what appears to be Buckingham Palace with a 'large-nosed' Kate cradling her newborn, Prince George, in one arm.

William meanwhile appears with a decidedly chiseled jaw and a generous mop of brown hair.

For viewers unable to distinguish the ill-portioned characters, Play-Doh captioned an image of the scene posted to Facebook: 'We were thrilled to welcome Baby George to the royal family in 2013!'

One commentator jokingly wrote in response: 'Perhaps the intern assigned to that one is not a fan of the royal family? Or is, in fact, a child playing with Play-Doh?'

Flying high: Twitter became a public company in September

Play-Doh, which is composed of flour, water, salt, boric acid, and mineral oil, was first manufactured in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., as a wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s.

When a classroom of children began using the wallpaper cleaner as a modeling compound, the product was reworked and marketed to schools in the mid-1950s.

Since its launch on the toy market it has generated a considerable amount of ancillary merchandise such as The Fun Factory and in 2003, the Toy Industry Association included it on its 'Century of Toys List'.
