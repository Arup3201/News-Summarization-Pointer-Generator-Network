A photographer who volunteers at shelters for those sleeping rough has taken a series of portraits showing the true face of homelessness in London, and they're not what you might expect.

In one, an attractive blonde smiles confidently at the camera, her eyes sparkling. Another shows a man in a sharp suit, grinning cheekily and exuding happiness.

They are among a number of shots taken by Rosie Holtom, 31, who wanted to challenge the preconceptions of homelessness.

According to Ms Holtom, who works as an animator by 
day, she wanted to break the norm of picturing homeless people in such a
way as to make them appear hard-up and desperate.

Instead, she has shot simple portraits
of the guests which she says shows their characters and not their 
homelessness.

She is hoping the pictures will challenge people's ideas of what homeless men and 
women in London look like.

Ms
Holtom says she has met many interesting people at Shelter from the Storm, a free homeless centre in north London where she has worked for four years.

'I felt there was this huge disconnect between the stereotypes I
constantly saw portrayed in the media and the reality of the homeless 
people I was meeting.

'People
assume all homeless people are drunks or addicts, cast out from 
society, the reality is very different. I have met people from all 
backgrounds and a rising number of young people who simply can't afford 
rent in London.'

According 
to the photographer, some of the residents' told her stories of being 
kicked out by corrupt landlords, running away from a violent spouse or 
being asked to leave the family home illustrate this point.

Instead of encouraging stereotypes Ms Holtom asked her subjects at Shelter from the Storm to dress and pose exactly how they would like to be seen.Â 

She
said: 'We see a lot of teary shots of teenagers on the street in the 
run up to Christmas but I think people have become desensitised to hard 
hitting images like this.

'I feel it is time more positive imagery is used to mobilise people to help.'

'Our
guests at the shelter are now putting their lives back together and 
looking forwards, I wanted to portray them as the strong people they 
are.

'A wonderful thing to come from the project is that they have been so happy with their images.

'People
become invisible so quickly when they are sleeping rough in London and a
beautiful portrait becomes something very symbolic.'
