Women who use surrogate mothers to have a child do not have a legal right to maternity leave when the baby is born, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Tuesday.

The 1992 law governing who does get maternity leave states that it must be granted to a woman ‘who has been pregnant and who has given birth to a child,’ it noted. This means that under EU law even if the birth mother gives the baby away, she still retains the right to maternity leave.

The European Union's highest court said 
EU ‘law does not establish a right to paid leave equal to maternity 
leave or adoption leave’ for women having a child by a surrogate.

At present a British employer does not have to give paid maternity leave to someone who has a baby through a surrogate arrangement and the EU ruling backed this up.

The ECJ stated that there is no law governing this aspect of maternity leave - but left the door open for member states to address this loophole.

The UK government is doing just that by modifying the Children & Families Act.

As Emma Burrows, Head of Employment at law firm Trowers & Hamlins, said, 'surrogacy arrangements are already on the cards', with intended parents in surrogacy arrangements becoming entitled to flexible parental leave and pay when reforms come in in spring 2015.

She added that 'the rights to adoption leave and pay mirror those of maternity leave and pay'.

However, from next April, UK mothers who
 have children through surrogacy will be able to claim broadly 
equivalent maternity leave, despite the ECJ's ruling.

The ruling highlights a loophole in maternity laws that EU countries are free to address.

The ECJ said that member states are 'free to apply more favourable rules for the benefit of commissioning mothers' - and the UK's Children & Families Act is being modified from April 2015 so that those who 'commission' a birth have the same maternity rights as the birth mother.

Karen Bexley, Legal Director of Employment at Millbank Edge, told MailOnline that UK laws can differ from EU laws, as long as they meet the minimum standard set out by European judges.

She said: ‘The UK government implements European laws with its own UK legislation, which should be no less favourable than an individual’s European employment rights. The UK often “gold-plates” European employment rights by going beyond the European minimum requirements. In such cases an individual would rely on their more generous UK rights and seek enforcement of such rights within UK courts.

‘The UK government, within the Children’s And Families Act from April 2015, is trying to address loopholes such as the rights of parents in surrogacy arrangements, as well as making changes to the law to recognise modern day family relationships for example the introduction of shared parental leave.’

The ECJ was considering two cases: one of a British woman who worked for an NHS Foundation trust, Ms D, who could not get pregnant and had a child, fathered by her husband but carried by another woman and using another woman's egg.

The husband and wife were subsequently given full parental rights over the child with the consent of the surrogate mother.

She initially took her case to a tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne, claiming discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, but that ruled in 2011 that the birth mother has the right to maternity leave, not her.

In the second case, a teacher in Ireland, Ms Z, who was fertile but had no uterus, used a surrogate mother in California. She and her husband were the child's full biological parents and recognised as such under US law.

In both cases, however, when the women asked for maternity leave so as to look after their babies, their employers turned them down on the grounds that neither had gone through a pregnancy or adopted their children.

Reviewing the cases against EU legislation on conditions for working mothers, fair treatment and physical handicap, the court said it could find no grounds to say that such a refusal of maternity leave breached EU law.

Marian Bloodworth, an employment partner at Berwin Leighton Paisner, told The Guardian: ‘The ECJ's narrow interpretation that only birth mothers get maternity leave goes counter to the prevailing trend in the UK, which is to recognise the importance of intended mothers, whether through surrogacy or adoption, to have time off from work in order to allow them to bond with their new baby or child.'

Vanessa Hogan, an employment lawyer at Hogan Lovell, said that advances in medical technology mean surrogacy is more common than ever, but that the law hasn’t moved with the times.

The rights to adoption leave mirror those of maternity leave.
