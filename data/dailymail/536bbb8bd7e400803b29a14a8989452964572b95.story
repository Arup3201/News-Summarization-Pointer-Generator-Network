An Oregon middle school football coach fired for planning an end-of-season team party for his players, ages 12 to 14, at Hooters went through with hosting the event on Saturday afternoon.

Coach Randy Burbach, from Corbett Middle School, organized the awards night at Jantzen Beach Hooters in the Portland area, but the choice of location quickly sparked outrage in the community.

The Hooters brand is known for waitresses in skimpy uniforms, and the Facebook page for the Jantzen Beach restaurant is plastered with big-breasted, bikini-clad women.

Hooters even offered to pay for the awards banquet, CBS Atlanta reports, and will donate $1,000, plus 20 percent of Saturday's sales, to the Corbett Booster Club.

The Corbett football players celebrated the end of the season at Hooters on Saturday. Hooters agreed to pay for the event and donate 20 percent of the day's sales to the Corbett Booster Club

15 of the 23 players for Corbett Middle School football
players attended the event Saturday afternoon, Oregonlive.com reports, after being driven to the event in a stretch limo.

Entering the Hooters parking lot, they were greeted by a crowd of cheering Hooters waitresses.

Burbach told Oregonlive that some players had other commitments, while others didn't attend because of moral concerns.

In a letter to parents on Monday, the school district's athletic director J.P. Soulagnet slammed Burbach and said he tried to get him to move the dinner so 'families could attend and feel comfortable' but he 'was unyielding and emphatically said no.'

'As a school district and athletic department, we do not support nor condone the decision to hold an end of season celebration at Hooters for any of our teams,' Soulagnet wrote in the note.

'It is not a restaurant that I would 
feel good about my wife or daughter working at. I think it sends the 
wrong message to our young men and that saddens and worries me the 
most,' he wrote.

Soulagnet told the Associated Press that 'three or four' families complained about the location.

'I
think there are better locations,' he added. 'Hooters is known worldwide for a number of things, and I don't think food is one of them.'

However, Burbach defended his decision and said he would not bow to pressure to move the party because he always told his boys to stand up for what they believe in.

He told KGW News he didn't choose Hooters for its sexual overtones and believes it is perfectly appropriate for families, adding that his own children had a positive experience there at age 12.

'I believe this is a fine venue, Burbach told Oregonlive.com. 'It's not a strip club. If you have a dirty mind, you'll find dirt.'

'You teach your linemen to play through pressure,' he said, referring to the backlash, 'and that's exactly what's happening to me.'
