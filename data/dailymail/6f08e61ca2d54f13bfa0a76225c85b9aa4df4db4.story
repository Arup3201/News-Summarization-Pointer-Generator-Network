All she wanted to do was see her grandchildren.

For four years, Norma Moore tried to get in touch with her son’s young twins, whom she hadn’t seen since he died in 2009.

But this week, her battle landed her in court – after her son’s widow accused her of harassment.

Mrs Moore, a 69-year-old choir singer, had spent four months waiting for the case to come to trial, but was finally vindicated when prosecutors offered no evidence at the hearing.

Accused of harassment: For four years, Norma Moore had tried to get in touch with her son's young twins, whom she hadn't seen since he died in 2009

As magistrates acquitted Mrs Moore, who was spared the indignity of standing in the dock, applause broke out in the public gallery from the dozen friends and relatives who had supported her.

Mrs Moore’s solicitor said it was the first case she had heard of in her 30-year career in which a grandmother in Mrs Moore’s position had been taken to a criminal court accused of harassment.

Mrs Moore has not seen her twin grandchildren since a few months before their father, Stephen, a project manager, died of bowel cancer in May 2009, at the age of 41.

They are now just a few months off their tenth birthdays. 

After her acquittal, Mrs Moore said the fight to maintain contact with the children had devastated the health of her 74-year-old husband John, an ex-farming union secretary.

She blamed the stress of their long fight – which included three run-ins with police – for a string of mini-strokes suffered by Mr Moore.

Mrs Moore said: ‘I am a loving grandmother who has never been near a police station, let alone a court before. 

‘How can I be taken to court simply for trying to stay in touch with my only grandchildren? 

‘It isn’t right. John and I have suffered a double loss. Not only have we had to bury our only son, but we have lost contact with our only grandchildren. 

‘We don’t even know if the children realise we are still alive.’

She said the case highlighted how it was not only the parents of separated couples who could lose contact with their grandchildren.

She added that she had been determined to ‘have my day in court’ on behalf of other grandparents in a similar position. 

Mrs Moore added: ‘Stephen assured us before he died that we wouldn’t lose contact with our grandchildren.

‘I will keep fighting for him as much as myself. Grandparents have so much to offer their grandchildren. 

‘We used to pick the children up from school. We would ice cakes together and I would always make them an Easter bonnet.’

The Government has promised to address the issue, but grandparents still have no legal right to access to their grandchildren – although they do have the right to apply to the family court for leave of access.

Mrs Moore said family lawyers had warned her such action could cost thousands of pounds– money she does not have. 

Her defence costs in the criminal case this week were covered by legal aid.

The pensioner, from Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, said she had no idea why her daughter-in-law, a part-time veterinary nurse, halted access to the children following Stephen’s death. 

The couple had met at school when Stephen was 17 and Lesley a year younger. Mrs Moore claimed that after Stephen died, Lesley let out their home and moved away with the children.

The Moores hired a private detective, and that December he tracked Lesley down to a village near Worcester, where she was living with a new partner and the children. 

Lesley, 44, told police her mother-in-law was harassing her, and Mrs Moore was interviewed, but said the Crown Prosecution Service decided against any charges.

The Moores began sending their grandchildren cheques in birthday and Christmas cards, first to their home and later to their school, without acknowledgement.

By June last year they were so desperate to see the children they drove to their village home. Lesley’s partner called police and the Moores left after speaking to officers.

West Mercia Police later wrote to Mrs Moore to advise that no further action would be taken, but warned that any future contact could ‘constitute harassment’.

This June Mrs Moore was issued a summons to court. The indictment accused her of harassing Lesley through the sending of four cards or letters between December last year and March 2013. 

They consisted of a letter to Lesley, a letter to her partner’s mother, pleading for her help to resolve the situation, and a letter to Lesley from Mrs Moore’s lawyer.

The fourth and final communication consisted of some Easter cards which Mrs Moore sent to the children’s head teacher in the hope they would be passed on. 

Her solicitor, Judith Kenney, said: ‘The sorry fact is a decent, law-abiding mother and grandmother was placed at risk of a criminal conviction because of one question which has still not been answered: “Why can’t she see her grandchildren?” ’

She warned that Mrs Moore and her husband will need to find a ‘fighting fund’ to take their case to the family court.  

Lesley Moore declined to comment on the case.
