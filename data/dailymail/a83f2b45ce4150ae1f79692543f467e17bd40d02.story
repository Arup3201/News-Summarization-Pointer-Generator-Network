A rare first-hand account of the Battle of Rorke's Drift - where 150 soldiers successfully fought off 4,000 Zulu warriors, has gone on display for the first time.

Written by one of the British heroes on a tiny scrap of paper, it is thought to be the earliest account of the battle which was immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine and Stanley Baker.

Assistant Commissary Officer (ACO) Walter Dunne's letter to his friend Captain W.J. Warneford at Cape Colony, describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at Rorke's Drift in South Africa.

The Battle of Rorke's Drift was famously immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine and Stanley Baker (pictured)

The unique relic was dated January 24, 1879 - two days after the British Army suffered one of their worst defeats in history when 1,350 were slaughtered by the Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana. 

ACO Dunne was later recommended for the Victoria Cross for his role in the heroic stand.

He wrote that, within just two hours of receiving word that 4,000 Zulu warriors were heading towards them, the soldiers had managed fortified their tiny stronghold with grain biscuit boxes.

Soon the Zulus were attacking 'determinedly on all sides.'

In it he describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at Rourke's Drift in South Africa

The invading army drove the troops out of the hospital, killed its patients and set it alight. 

ACO Dunne goes onto say they then made several attempts to storm the outpost, but the 80-strong group of men kept fighting and by morning, the Zulus had retreated leaving 351 dead bodies.

The letter, which was bought by The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, was hand written from Rorke's Drift less than 24 hours after the battle on a chit for bags of mealie. 

He also describes how, after the Zulus killed 1,500 British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandlwana, they headed to the outpost at Rorke's Drift, quickly surrounding the troops.

Those famous scenes were recreated in Zulu, starring Stanley Baker as senior officer Lieutenant John Chard, who assumes command of the small British detachment, and Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. 

 Rorke's Drift/ 24 Jan.r '79/

My dear Warneford, 

Sad news about the 1/24th. (1st Battalion, 24th Foot) 5Cd commanded by Col. Pulleine were cut to pieces and the camp sacked. 20 Officers are missing.

About 1000 of the Kafirs came in here and attacked us on the same day (22nd). We had got about 2 hours notice and fortified the place with trap of grain biscuit boxes &c. They came on most determinedly on all sides. They drove our fellows out of the Hospital, killed the patients and burned the place.

They made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers (B Co of 24th under Bromhead) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time. We had only 80 men, the contingent having bolted before a shot was fired. The fight was kept up all night & in the morning the Kafirs retreated leaving 351 dead bodies.

Dalton was wounded in the shoulder and temp clerk Byrne killed & 12 of the men... W A Dunne (over)

Some of the missing are Pulleine, Col. Dunford, Capt. Russell, Hodson (killed), Anstey, Daly, Mostyn, Dyer, Griffith, Pope, Austin, Pulleine (2 Mr.) Shepherd (S... major) Wardell (killed), Younghusband, Degacher, Porteous, Carage Dyson, Atkinson - Coghill is believed to have escaped & also Melvill.

Set in the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Isandlwana, the band of men fight through day and night, defending wave after wave of the attackers from their small missionary post.

In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a small redoubt constructed out of mealie bags where they manage to inflict heavy casualties.

It buys the British soldiers a three-hour reprieve but when the Zulus re-form once more, they are resigned to their defeat. Instead the warriors sing a song to honour their bravery and withdraw.

The Rorke's Drift letter was discovered in an album of letters, paintings and other items collected by Captain WJ Warneford's wife Winifred.

The sale at auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, also saw letters from Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Foot, fetch £1,200 when they went under the hammer. They were bought by a collector who specialises in the Zulu wars. Lt Bromhead was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the battle.

Letters from Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Durnford, who was killed at nearby Isandlwana, were also part of the sale.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described Dunne's letter as a 'unique piece of history'. 

'Material from Rorke's Drift is like hen's teeth - you just do not come across it.'

ACO Dunne, who was in charge of the stores at Rorke's Drift, praises Lt Bromhead in the letter, who was played by Caine in the famous film.

The defence of Rorke's Drift was recognised with the awarding of no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. ACO Dunne, from County Cork, was turned down for a VC but was mentioned in dispatches.

After 35 years of service, he retired to Gibraltar in 1908 but died the same year at a nursing home.

Mr Aldridge described the album as a 'fascinating chronicle of a colonial family in the early part of the 19th century - a tumultuous period of history'.

Curator of the The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh (Brecon) Richard Davies where the  letter is now on display said it gave a 'unique insight' into the famous battle

'It's a very important part of the collection and very relevant to the displays we have here.

'We think it is the earliest written account of the battle, which would have been written while they were still recovering from the attack.'

De Neuville's Painting of the Battle of Rorke's Drift, based on eye witness accounts  it depicts several events of the battle occurring at once.

 It was on January 22 1879, on the Natal border with Zululand, in South Africa, that the tiny British garrison of 140 men - many of them sick and wounded - fought for at least 12 hours to repel repeated attacks by up to 4,000 Zulu warriors.

The defence was rewarded by Queen Victoria's government with no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses.

The name of Rorke's Drift led to the much-loved film starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine.

The movie, which is still celebrated more than 50 years after it was made, saw Baker play Lieutenant John Chard, while Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead.

After fighting day and night the Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded.

It was part of the wider Anglo - Zulu war took place during 1879.

The conflict began because the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa.

The British invasion of Zululand began on January 11 1879, with the British objective being an eventual federation in Africa.

The battle of Isandlwana erupted on the 22nd of January 1879, 11 days after the British started their invasion. 20,000 Zulu warriors attacked 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and 400 civilians.

The Zulus, who had more numbers, overwhelmed the British, killing over 1,300 troops, while around 1,000 Zulu soldiers were killed.

The battle of Rorke's Drift started almost immediately after, ending on the 23rd.

The Battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July 1879 effectively ended the Zulu-Anglo war, with the defeat of the Zulu forces by the British when over 5,200 British and African soldiers razed the capital of Zululand after defeating the main Zulu army.

The war ultimately ended with a British victory, and Zulu independence.
