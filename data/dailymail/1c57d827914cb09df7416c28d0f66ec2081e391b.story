Uruguay's radical plans to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace could be jeopardy following yesterday's presidential election

Tabare Vazquez was elected president for the second time in a decade, continuing the leftist coalition’s rule in the South American nation.

His win is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and ought to secure the government’s radical marijuana plans.

However, with polls showing that most Uruguayans oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed, and Vazquez’s promise to proceed with the plan unless it produced negative results, the project might be at risk.

Cheer and fear: It is feared that the re-election of Tabare Vazquez, pictured after winning the presidential elections yesterday, may put the plan to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace at risk

During his first run as president from 2005 to 2010, Vazquez governed as a relatively cautious moderate, avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as Venezuela. 

Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist, topped centre-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday's vote. 

During his campaign, Lacalle Pou criticized the marijuana plan, saying he would shut down the state-run pot market, while allowing domestic cultivation of the plant. 

The law was voted through under current President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk. 

Both Vazquez and Mujica belong to the Broad Front coalition, which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same-sex marriage, abortion and marijuana.

Winner: Tabare Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist, topped center-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday's presidential vote

Same-same, but different: Even though current President Jose Mujica, right, and president elect Tabare Vazquez, belong to the same left-leaning coalition that has moved to create the world's first state-run marijuana marketplace, the pair are known to have clashed within the party

Not so pro: The pro-marijuana laws were passed in May this year, but the implementation is going slower than the government planned, and polls how that 60 per cent of Uruguayans oppose them

This time around, Mujica's popularity and a strong economy helped propel Vazquez into office, where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity, not of change. 

Vazquez, who starts his new term on March 1, has at times clashed with Mujica within the coalition.

The president-elect cuts a much more sober figure than Mujica, who still drives around in his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle and is known as 'the world's poorest president', and the marijuana law, his landmark initiative, may face an uncertain future in Vazquez's hands.

Under the law, the first of its kind in the world, marijuana users were supposed to be able to choose a supply source - pharmacies, cannabis clubs or home-grown plants - and buy or grow the drug in a regulated, fully legal market.

Vazquez, who made strict anti-tobacco legislation one of his top priorities in his first term, has spoken out forcefully against smoking pot, called the idea of pharmacy sales 'incredible' and said that if elected he would make 'any corrections necessary' to the law.

There are also other threats against the law, with recent polls showing that despite its international popularity, more than 60 per cent Uruguayans oppose the marijuana laws and want them repealed.

Joy: After the law was first voted through, pro-marijuana campaigners partied in the streets of Montevideo

Uruguayan authorities are still in the process of rolling out the pot marketplace, and although the law went into effect in May, it will not become reality until after Vazquez takes office.

Just last week it was announced that the implementation of the marijuana law is progressing slower than the Mujica government had planned.

Last Wednesday, the National Drugs Board said Uruguay could start selling marijuana in pharmacies in March, although the government had initially been aiming for year-end.

Mujica's marijuana legislation allows each household to register to grow up to six plants while users inscribed into an official list may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmacies.

The number of people registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at home has jumped to 1,200 from 600 a month ago as fears have eased that the conservative opposition might win the vote and derail the legislation.

The reform is being followed closely across Latin America where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the U.S.-led 'war on drugs.'

Uruguay is one of Latin America's most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal since 1998. It estimates it has some 150,000 recreational smokers.
