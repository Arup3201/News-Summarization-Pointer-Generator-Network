Arsenal have snapped up highly-rated Barcelona youth product Georgios Spanoudakis, who previously rejected a number of offers to sign with Arsene Wenger's side.

The 15-year-old central midfielder joined the Catalan club's La Masia academy from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2009, but will now join Arsenal's Under-18 set-up for the coming season.

Spanoudakis has made several appearances for Germany's youth teams, but could still choose to play for Greece should he wish to transfer his nationality.

On the move: German youngster Georgios Spanoudakis has signed for Arsenal

Talent pool: Arsene Wenger has signed another product of the Barcelona academy

Talent: Wenger found a gem when he signed Cesc Fabregas as a Barcelona youngster

The 15-year-old looked up to Andres Iniesta at the Camp Nou but also models himself on Mesut Ozil.

Despite 
his attacking heroes it’s Sergi Busquets that Barça hoped ‘Georgios’ 
would turn into before Arsenal persuaded him to move to London. And it 
was even further back as a central defender that he first impressed the 
Catalans.

He took 
part in a summer tournament in Catalonia in 2009 playing for Eintracht 
and then-coordinator of Barcelona’s youth system Albert Benaiges spotted
 and took him to the club’s La Masia academy.

Born close
 to Salonica in Greece his family moved to Germany before his first 
birthday settling in a small town just outside of Frankfurt.

Left-footed like his role model Ozil big things were expected of him at Barcelona now the club’s supporters are hoping Arsenal

The Germany youth international is in the mold of former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas with an eye for a killer pass and technical ability.

Spanoudakis becomes the seventh signing of Arsenal's youth team following Kristopher Da Graca, Ben Sheaf, Elias Hatzitheodoridis, Hugo Keto, Jonatas Centeno and Savvas Mourgos to the Emirates.

The Barca youngster's signature won't be the first that Wenger has grabbed over the years as the Frenchman has made a habbit of picking up some of the best Catalan talent.

Most notably, of course, Wenger plucked Fabregas from the Barcelona B team at just 16 years of age back in 2003.

Cesc Fabregas

The Spaniard made his debut for Arsenal in 2003 at 16-years-old and quickly became a fan favourite. Fabregas was soon made club captain and made 303 appearances for the north Londoners, scoring 57 goals before returning to Barcelona in 2011.

Jon Toral

A Spanish youth international, Toral joined the Gunners in 2011 and has impressed as he's moved through the club's youth teams. The 18-year-old midfielder signed a proffessional contract with Arsenal in 2012, but was injured for the majority of last year after impressing early on.

Hector Bellerin

Bellerin swapped Catalonia for north London in 2011 along with his Spanish comrade Toral. The skilful defender has made a handful of appearance for Arsenal's reserves and is currently on loan at Gianfranco Zola's Watford until January, 2013.

Fran Merida

The 23-year-old joined Arsenal's acedamy in 2005, but failed to break into the first team at the Emirates. The midfielder had hoped to emulate his compatriot Fabregas, but decided to leave Arsenal in 2010 to join Athletico Madrid. After just 20 league appearances in two seasons, Merida joined Brazilian side Atletico Paranaense.

Julio Pleguezuelo Selva

Pleguezuelo signed for Arsenal in the summer and his style has already been likened to that of Barca defender Carlos Puyol. The 16-year-old Spaniard can play anywhere across the back four and Wenger will hope he can progress through Arsenal's development squads.
