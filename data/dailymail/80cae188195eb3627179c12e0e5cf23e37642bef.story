To buy this, you'll need to spend a lot more than a penny.

A stunning four-bedroom has gone on the market complete with a former Victorian public toilet, known as a pissoir 

The home on Star Yard in London's legal district was built in 1884 and used as a warehouse to store documents.

A multi-million pound house (right) has gone onto the market with a difference - it is being offered with a Victorian loo (left)

Earlier this year it was transformed into a stylish four-bedroom townhouse. But, with the property put on the market for £4.4 million, you'll need to be flush to buy it.

The Grade II Listed outbuilding was built by McDowall, Steven and Co and retains all the signs of top workmanship the Glaswegian ironworks became famous for.

The intricate patterns that adorn the panels show no signs of ageing, nor does the mounted crest, which is unique to this pissoir.

Number 3 Star Yard, which was converted by property developer Marldon, has been put on the market with the Mayfair office of Jackson-Stops & Staff.

Zoe Mercer, manager of residential development at Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'I have sold a lot of Grade II listed homes in the past but never a listed public convenience.

'It is rare to get a freehold property in this area of London and the toilet makes it really interesting.

Inside: The space inside the toilet can be used for storage or as a green space

The Victorian house has now been transformed into a stylish four-bedroom townhouse with a £4.4 million price-tag

'It could be used for storage or as a green space. We have just launched the property with the toilet and there has been a lot of buzz about it.

'When I tell people about the pissoir I am normally met with a pause of surprise and then intrigue. It is now just an empty space but people are really surprised to hear about it.'

The lower ground floor of 3 Star Yard has a bedroom, media room, utility room, bathroom and terrace.

The house also has a lift and all of the rooms have discreet in-ceiling speakers for central sound distribution

On the ground floor is a large reception hall and another bedroom.

There are two bedrooms, both with en-suite, on the first floor while the second floor has the kitchen and drawing room.

The house also has a lift and all of the rooms have discreet in-ceiling speakers for central sound distribution.

Mercer added: 'The property itself has always been a warehouse and was used store legal documents. It has never been lived in and the conversion was only finished in Spring.

'There is the classic front, but inside comes with all the mod-cons. It is an extraordinary home.'
