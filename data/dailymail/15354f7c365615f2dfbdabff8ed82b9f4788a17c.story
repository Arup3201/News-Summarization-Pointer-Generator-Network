The world is facing an 'economic time bomb' because of methane gases being produced by shrinking sea levels in the Arctic, researchers claim.

There is a large amount of methane stored in the region around the East Siberian Sea and if it was suddenly released into the atmosphere it could change the Earth's climate causing extreme weather, flooding and drought.

By using economic modelling, scientists from Cambridge and Rotterdam discovered
that if the Arctic ice levels continue to shrink at their current rate it could produce 
enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £40 trillion - 
the same size of the world economy in 2012.

Scientists from Cambridge and Rotterdam have discovered that shrinking Arctic ice levels could produce enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £40 trillion. Methane released into the atmosphere could change the Earth's climate causing extreme weather, flooding and drought

The groundbreaking claims were made by Gail Whiteman from Erasmus University, Chris Hope, 
Reader in Policy Modelling at Cambridge Judge Business School, 
University of Cambridge, and Peter Wadhams, Professor of Ocean physics 
at the University of Cambridge.

They calculated - using an economic computer program called PAGE09 - that the thaw would release 50 
gigatonnes of methane into the air.

If other factors, such 
as ocean acidification are included, the cost would be much higher.

Around 80 per cent of these costs caused by the damage will directly affect developing countries as they 
experience more extreme weather, flooding, droughts and poorer health as
Arctic warming affects climate.

It is said to be the first time researchers have calculated the potential economic impact of methane from the East Siberian Sea being released into the air as a result of the thaw.

Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping.

Some gases remain in the atmosphere and don't react physically or chemically to changes in temperature.

These gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, are described as 'forcing' climate change and contribute to the greenhouse effect and include:

Carbon dioxide is a small but important part of the atmosphere.

It is released through natural processes including volcanic eruptions as well human actions such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.

Methane is a hydrocarbon gas produced through natural sources, such as the shrinking ice levels in the Arctic, as well as human actions including waste in landfills, agriculture and rice cultivation.

Methane is considered a more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

If a large amount of methane was suddenly released into the air, it could bring the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds 2 degrees Celsius by between 15 and 35 years.

Although this constitutes just a fraction of the vast reservoirs of methane in 
the Arctic, scientists believe that the release of even a small 
proportion of these reserves could trigger possibly catastrophic climate
change.

'The global impact of a warming Arctic is an economic time-bomb,' said Whiteman.

Wadhams added: 'The imminent disappearance of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will have enormous implications for both the acceleration of climate change, and the release of methane from off-shore waters which are now able to warm up in the summer.

'This massive methane boost will have major implications for global economies and societies.'

Most discussions about a warming Arctic focus on increased oil-and-gas drilling and the opening up of new shipping routes that attract investments of hundreds of billions of dollars.

The researchers added these economic discussions are missing the big picture on Arctic change and call for the World Economic Forum to invest in the further modelling needed to assess the true costs.

They also want to encourage world leaders to 'consider the economic time-bomb beyond short-term gains from shipping and extraction.'

The claims also suggest that the methane released by the shrinking levels would bring forward the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds two degrees Celsius by between 15 and 35 years.

Dr Chris Hope, of Cambridge University, added: 'In the absence of climate-change mitigation measures the model calculates it would increase mean global climate impacts by $60 trillion.'
