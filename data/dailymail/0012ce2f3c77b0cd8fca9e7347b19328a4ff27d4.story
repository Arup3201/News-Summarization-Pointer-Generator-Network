Hugh Grant has urged Britain to reintroduce National Service, saying:  ‘It goes with our personality. It suits us.’

Although the actor has never served in the  Forces, he paid tribute  to Britain’s military  tradition, which made heroes of his forefathers.

Speaking at last week’s launch of singer and photographer Bryan Adams’s book Wounded: The Legacy Of War, Grant, 54, said: ‘My father and grandfather both served and it shaped them.

Ideal: The actor said Britain is an ideal nation for military service because 'we get on with things'

‘National Service can definitely benefit society. Britain is an ideal nation  for military service because we get on with things.’

Calling for a return to National Service is usually the preserve of Tory politicians, but Grant added: ‘I have left views, but I also have right views.’

The actor’s grandfather Major James Murray Grant served with the Seaforth Highlanders and  was awarded a Distinguished Service Order  for bravery and leadership during the Second World War. He had defied an order to surrender to overwhelming German troops when stranded at St Valery-en-Caux, France, after the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation.

Grant’s father, also called James, trained at Sandhurst and spent eight years in the Army.

But the millionaire actor admitted that ‘probably the closest I’ll get’ to military service is playing a  naval intelligence commander in Guy Ritchie’s forthcoming film The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who has drawn up a Private Member’s Bill calling for Britain to reintroduce National Service, said: ‘Hugh is clearly a very sensible chap. Now he has spoken out I hope we can eventually secure a debate in Parliament.’

However, an online campaign to prevent the return of National Service has 35,000 supporters.
