When council officials visited residents at a tower block to reassure them about a temperamental lift, there was only one way to do it.

Unfortunately, the show of faith by the six occupants - including a pregnant woman - backfired when they got stuck a couple of floors from the top.

After much fruitless jabbing of buttons, an emergency call was put through to firefighters to come to their aid.

Red-faced: The fire brigade had to be called when council officials got stuck in a lift on their way to convince residents of its safety

Now they'll listen: Residents at Grade II-listed Brooke House had made numerous complaints about the lift

The fire crew tried to wedge the lift open at Brooke House in Basildon, Essex, and shouted suggestions to those inside.

Meanwhile, red-faced colleagues on the other side of the doors made frantic phone calls to check those imprisoned in the lift were all right.

But the farce deepened when it suddenly sprang back into life, carrying the delegation down to the ground floor and then back up to the 12th floor.

Are you alright in there? Colleagues made frantic phone calls to communicate with the trapped officials

At this point the doors opened, allowing the five council officials and an Essex Fire Service safety officer to scramble out after 30-minutes of drama.

The group took to the stairs to complete their trip to see residents as part of a community safety event.

The irony of the situation was not lost those living in the Grade II-listed building, who have made numerous complaints about the lift breaking down.

Amber Cooper, 30, who lives there with her five-year-old son, Jamie, said: ‘We have put up with this all the time so it’s good for the council to see first-hand what it’s like.

‘It’s a total nightmare. My mum is disabled, so she struggles to get to me when the lifts aren’t working.’ Another resident, a woman in her 50s, added: ‘You have to laugh as you really couldn’t make it up.

‘At least now these people can see what we have to put up with.’

The firefighters tried to wedge the doors, but eventually the lift descended and they opened of their own accord

Basildon Council had invited residents of the tower block - which has 14 habitable floors lifted 40ft into the air on massive concrete stilts - to come to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss problems, including anti-social behaviour and the troublesome lifts.

When no one showed up - probably because they were scared they wouldn’t make it - the officials decided to seek out residents themselves.

The council yesterday said refurbishment work had now begun on the one of the lifts. The other one is due to be updated in February.

A spokesman added: ‘Fortunately, what goes up must come down. The problem was quickly resolved and did not disrupt the main event.

‘However, it did give council officers first-hand evidence of how much the lift improvements are needed and how much it will benefit local residents of Brooke.
