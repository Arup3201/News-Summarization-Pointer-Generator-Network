The waiter who has confessed to 
killing two British women in a Turkish wood earlier tried to cover up 
their murders by claiming they had been abducted by a gang of men.

Recep Cetin, 17, has been charged with
 stabbing to death Marion Graham, 54, following a row over her daughter 
Shannon, 15, who he was dating.

He is alleged to have driven Mrs 
Graham and her friend Kathy Dinsmore, 54, to a forest near Izmir and 
killed them. Mrs Graham was stabbed in her heart and Mrs  Dinsmore had 
her throat cut.

Accused: Recep Cetin with 15-year-old Shannon. He wanted to marry her and start a new life in Ireland

Cetin, who has been remanded in 
custody, was a well-known figure on the beachfront at the Turkish resort
 of Kusadasi, on the Aegean Sea on the west of the country, and was 
nicknamed ‘Alex’ by British tourists.

The teenager, who dropped out of 
school at 13, had been dating Shannon for two years. In May, he rented a
 villa in Kusadasi which he shared with Shannon, her mother and Miss 
Dinsmore.

Mrs Graham and her daughter, who lived
 in County Down, Northern Ireland, but travelled on Irish passports, 
spent the summer months in Turkey.

Shared: The house in Korukent, Kusadasi, where they all lived

But neighbours say they often heard shouting and arguing coming from the villa.

Reports claim Cetin told police he had
 pleaded with Marion one last time in the woods to let Shannon stay in 
Kusadasi and marry him. But she refused, claiming Shannon was too young,
 and was supported by her friend Kathy.

One resident said: ‘They didn’t really
 fit in here. It’s a very quiet, friendly place. There was a lot of 
aggression and raised voices – we kept our distance.’ On Thursday, Cetin
 offered to take Marion and Kathy on a shopping trip to Izmir, 70 miles 
away, after dropping off Shannon to go on a boat trip.

According to Cetin’s uncle, who has 
asked not to be named, Cetin then used a local taxi to ferry them to 
Izmir where his father Eyup runs a corner shop. From there Cetin took a 
family car to drive the women out to the woodland area of Buca.

Cetin returned to Kusadasi where he 
claimed a black van had pulled up in the forest with three men inside. 
He said the men tried to abduct Marion and Kathy, and while trying to 
fight them off he was cut on the hand and knocked unconscious.

Media reports in Turkey have named Recep Celik as the suspect in the double murder

But according to his uncle his story was unconvincing.

‘When I arrived at Kusadasi police 
station Cetin and Shannon were there. Cetin had a cut bandaged on his 
hand. He couldn’t explain how he returned to Kusadasi.’

Turkish police initially arrested Cetin’s father, Eyup, and the taxi driver that had taken the group to Izmir.

But his uncle said: ‘After a few hours
 of interrogation Cetin broke down and confessed to killing the women. 
He told police Marion planned to take Shannon back to Ireland, ending 
their romance and the pair were heartbroken.’

Marion, who was divorced from 
Shannon’s father, had remarried a Turk named Yucel but the pair have 
separated. Shannon’s father Raymond McGuinness also owns a home in 
Kusadasi.

He arrived in Izmir yesterday after flying from Ireland to be 
with his daughter and to identify the bodies.

Last night he said: ‘I have met Shannon and she is very upset. This is clearly a very distressing time for us.’

Cetin has been further remanded in custody but his father, Eyup, and the taxi driver were released.

Last night it emerged that the former 
husband of Kathy Dinsmore, Dan Doyle, suffered a double tragedy last 
week when his current wife, Colette, 54, died in hospital on the same 
day Kathy was killed. Colette, the mother of three of Mr Doyle’s 
children, died suddenly in Craigavon Area Hospital, Portadown, on 
Thursday.
