Facebook is considering launching legal action against a small Dubai hairdressers - that is named Facelook.

Not only does the name resemble the social network giant's but its logo is also strikingly similar.

The men's salon has simple white lettering on a blue background, just like the iconic branding of Facebook.

Facebook said it is investigating whether Dubai hairdressers Facelook (pictured) has infringed its copyright

The owner of the hairdressers said any similarity between his logo and Facebook's was a coincidence

Now the company, which is based in California, said it is investigating whether the hairdressers has breached its intellectual property rights.

However the owner of Facelook, based in Discovery Gardens, said any similarity was a coincidence.

The owner, who did not want to be named, toldÂ The National that he had registered the name and brand under UAE labour law.

He said: 'We started with the name Facelook, but when later on the branding came through, coincidentally it looked like Facebook.

'For a normal guy, with a naked eye, it looks familiar. However, the colour and the font is different to Facebook.'

A Facebook spokesman for the Mena region told The National: 'We are careful to protect the Facebook brand and we will look more closely at this particular case.'

Last year Primark threatened to sue a shop in Dubai that opened under the same name.

Billion dollar company Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg (centre), is based in plush offices in California. A company spokesman said they are 'careful to protect the Facebook brand'

British shoppers who visited the store in the Bur Dubai district said the clothes had little resemblance to those sold in the famous bargain chain.

A spokesman for the brand said at the time: 'This is not a legitimate store and the company is considering its legal options'.

Businesses with similar names to international brands are warned to check they are not breaching copyright after a long line of small companies being threatened with legal action.

During London 2012, many businesses in the UK fell foul of trademark rules protecting Olympic logos.

The owners of Le Rose florists in Hanley, Stoke, were warned they risked being sued by Games organisers if they did not remove five rings and a torch made from tissue paper from the shop.

Google threatened to sue 23-year-old school dropout Andries Maree Van Der Merwe after he set up a jobseekers website and named it Doogle.
