A former journalist took her own life after suffering almost a decade of pain because doctors failed to repair her broken ankle, her husband said today.

Carole Denby, 63, was walking with her husband  in Carmarthen, Wales, when she slipped and broke her left ankle in 2006. She was airlifted to hospital where she had an operation.

However, it was unsuccessful - and the writer was forced to undergo a number of further operations in a bid to fix the injury.

Mrs Denby's husband Howard says an eight-year medical nightmare followed - during which time his wife suffered a stroke and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Freelance journalist Carole Denby, 63, took her own life after suffering eight years of pain due to a broken ankle

Mr Denby says the night before his wife died she was in a 'black mood' after she received a letter from a health board official saying her case would be looked at after she returned from annual leave.

The following day, the writer was found dead at her home in Pontyates, Carmarthenshire. She left a note which read: 'I’ve had enough. I’m sorry.'

Now Mr Denby is now calling for an independent inquiry to be launched following his wife's death - and says he is 'determined to get justice' for the freelance journalist.

Mr Denby said today: 'We were out walking in a 
wood near Carmarthen when Carole slipped and broke her left ankle badly.

Mrs Denby's left ankle was operated on several times by medics following her fall in 2006. Her husband says none of them were successful

'She had to be airlifted to Glangwili Hospital, where she was operated 
on. Unfortunately the operation was not successful, and Carole underwent
 a number of further operations which saw various plates, screws and 
bolts fitted.'

'She
 suffered serious, recurring infections and developed septicaemia, which
 I believe was caused by a reaction to the metal that had been inserted 
in her ankle.

'We 
were advised that she was too young for an ankle replacement. In May 
2010 Carole suffered a severe stroke, which added considerably to her 
medical complications.

'By 2011 she was suffering from delusions and was 
sectioned under the Mental Health Act. She had recurring mental health 
problems that arose from her physical suffering.'

Mr Denby says during this time he wrote to Hywel Dda University Health Board and its predecessor to try and secure better treatment for his wife.

But, he said, Mrs Denby struggled to cope with the pain throughout the process.

Speaking of her final day alive, Mr Denby said: 'We received an email reply to our latest complaint around teatime from [an official of the health board] advising she would look into the matter on returning from her annual leave. Carole was totally deflated by yet again being brushed aside.

'[By 11.30pm she had] a really black mood, saying she was a burden and I would have been better if I had never met her.

'I told her not to be so stupid and we would get through this together...but she was very upset and said she was just so very tired and frightened she may lose her legs.

'She asked me to help her to bed and I helped her undress and get into bed, telling her to get a good night’s sleep. 

Mr and Mrs Denby pictured together before her accident. Mr Denby says his wife suffered numerous infections following her accident in 2006, which he believes was a reaction to metal plates put in her ankle

'Just before midnight I took her the antibiotics and asked if she wanted a glass of milk or anything else but she said she was tired.'

The following morning Mr Denby said he
 took the dogs out for a walk. When he returned he went to see if Carole
 was up and wanted a cup of tea, but found her dead.

Mr
 Denby said: 'I am now determined to get Carole the justice she did not 
get when she was alive. There must be an independent inquiry into the 
treatment she received.'

Mr Denby says he complained to the board about various aspects of his wife’s treatment in numerous letters.

He also wrote to officials pressing them to authorise procedures which would help her recovery.

When he complained to the NHS Ombudsman last year, he was told his wife’s case could not be investigated because the first operation on her ankle had taken place too long before.

On June 19 last year, the health board’s chief executive Trevor Purt wrote to Mr Denby in response to a complaint he had made about his wife’s orthopaedic treatment.

He conceded the first operation hadn’t cured the problem, but said he did not agree that metallic fragments remained in Mrs Denby’s ankle after the later operations.

He therefore took the view the health board had not been responsible for failings that could result in a civil claim against it.

One of Mr Denby’s many concerns was the time it took for the health board to respond to his complaints.

Last June he received an apology from Mr Purt for a delay of more than five months in replying to an email.

Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the Assembly Member for for Carmarthen East & Dinefwr, said: 'Tens of letters have been written by myself and my staff to the health board about Mrs Denby’s case. My impression has been that not as much was done to help her as should have been.

'I was not happy with the board’s approach and in early February I asked for a meeting. I haven’t received a response, and sadly Mrs Denby is no longer alive. I certainly believe there should be an independent inquiry.'

A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda University Health Board said: 'We have carefully reviewed the care given to Carole Denby and have been in regular contact with her husband. We offer our condolences to Mr Denby and the university health board will fully co-operate with HM Coroner.'

A spokesman for the Carmarthenshire Coroner said an inquest was opened on the day of Mrs Denby’s death and will re-open after toxicology tests have been completed.
