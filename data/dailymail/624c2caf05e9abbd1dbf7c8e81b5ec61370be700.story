A conman who lived on benefits posed as a billionaire businessman to seduce a Harvard-educated Sotheby’s executive into handing him more than £600,000.

Cambridge University drop-out Alistair Stewart, 53, convinced Nina Siegenthaler he was a former Goldman Sachs partner now running his own hedge fund in Switzerland and the owner of a private jet, a yacht and a helicopter.

He targeted her by pretending to be interested in buying a £9million property on the Caribbean tax haven of Turks and  Caicos where Miss Siegenthaler is vice-president of Sotheby’s International Realty.

After catching her at a low point in her life, he spent six months grooming her on Skype, during which time she fell in love with him and agreed to let him invest her life savings.

He blew almost all of the cash in only four months by taking trips to see her, buying a £50,000 Mercedes, stays at luxury hotels and helicopter trips to London to shop at Harrods.

Stewart, who now faces jail, also cheated at least five other victims including a New York interior designer by pretending to be a super-rich international businessman after researching the role on the internet.

In fact, he operated his sophisticated con on his own from a computer in his housing association bedsit in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where he survived for most of the time on benefits. 

Miss Siegenthaler yesterday said the experience had been ‘absolutely horrendous’ after Stewart appeared at the Old Bailey to admit fraud.

The art history graduate, who has completed an executive programme on real estate management at Harvard Business School, said she did not wish to comment fully until next month’s sentencing, but urged others to be alert to the risks of conmen working on the internet.

She added: ‘You never believe something like this could happen to you. It is absolutely surreal. It is vital people realise the dangers that are out there. I hope this acts as a warning.’

Prosecutor Ben Maguire said outside court: ‘This man is a sophisticated conman.

‘He managed to persuade this poor lady he was a billionaire financier with Goldman Sachs who had started his own fund.

‘He groomed her over about six months. She fell in love with him and sent him one million dollars. He then funded a lifestyle that was like that of a billionaire.’

Detective Sergeant Mick Richards, of the Economic Crime Unit at Sussex Police, said: ‘Most people would wonder “how was it possible to con people so successfully?”

‘Only when you meet him do you realise what he is capable  of. His attention to detail was remarkable.

‘He was meticulous in researching every aspect of his scam on the internet, from complex financial systems to types of aircraft used by the very rich so that he could successfully present himself as an international fund manager.

‘Miss Siegenthaler has been incredibly strong through what has been a long investigation and we are very relieved to finally have a successful result for her.’

Stewart received the money from Miss Siegenthaler on September 27, 2010, but had spent almost all of it by January 2011. Only £40,000 has been recovered.

Stewart also convinced a US interior designer he could offer her work worth more than £500,000 over three years.

And he told a husband and wife that he was a former Goldman Sachs partner and could employ them as a captain and cook on his yacht.

At the Old Bailey yesterday he admitted one count of fraud on a ‘full facts basis’ which encompasses 12 allegations.

Stewart has been staying at The Priory, the private mental health hospital best known for treating celebrities.

Mr Maguire said: ‘We are not aware how he can afford the costs of the Priory.’Judge Stephen Kramer QC remanded Stewart in custody  for sentencing on December 19.

The judge told him: ‘All options are open and the almost inevitable conclusion would be a sentence of immediate custody.’
