An extremist preacher who is said to have played role in radicalising the murderers of soldier Lee Rigby has attempted to justify the killing of those fighting jihadis in Syria and Iraq.

Omar Bakri Muhammad, who was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah, has been openly using Facebook to say that it is sometimes necessary to kill women and children sheltering in schools and hospitals.

Bakri, who is banned from Britain and is facing terrorism charges in Lebanon, has been blamed for radicalising several young extremists, including the killers of Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

His posts on the social media site come just days after several websites were criticised for not raising the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Rigby in the six months before his death.

On his account, which has now been deleted from Facebook, he the made a post under the title 'killing women and children'.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, he wrote that even though this was not usually permitted, he added: 'One must distinguish between killing women and children and the Mujahideen fighting the Kuffar (non-believers) wherever they find them, whether that be in a school or hospital or elsewhere.'

He also added that the Mujahideen must kill people who do not believe in the extreme version of Islam, 'wherever they find them'.

A Facebook spokesman told the newspaper they don't comment on individual cases but added they do not permit terrorist material on their site.

Bakri, believed to be 54 now, was previously the London-based spiritual leader of the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun.

The messages come just days after Facebook was criticised for not raising the alarm about messages posted by one of Fusilier Rigby's (pictured) killers

He previously live in London and was under investigation by UK police after he called for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda.

On the London bombings it was also reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as 'the fantastic four'.

He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they 'did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan'.

In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’.

He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’.

The radical Islamic cleric was under house arrest in Tripoli since Lebanese security forces released him from jail in 2010, after striking a deal with the Shia extremist group Hezbollah.

Bakri was sentenced to life following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony.
