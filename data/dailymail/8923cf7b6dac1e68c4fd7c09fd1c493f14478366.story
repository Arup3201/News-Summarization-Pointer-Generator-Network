In court: Former fugitive Asil Nadir arriving at the Old Bailey where he denied stealing £150m from his empire

Polly Peck Tycoon Asil Nadir claimed 
he fled Britain because he had been left 'a broken man with no hope of a
fair trial' after police launched an investigation into allegations he 
had bribed a judge.

The revelation came to light as he 
took the stand for the first time in his long-running theft trial in 
which he is accused of plundering £150 million from his company.

Today it also emerged at the Old 
Bailey that Turkey asked Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative 
government to intervene to save Nadir’s business empire as it crumbled 
around him.

Turkish president Turgut Ozal wrote to
the then PM expressing his concerns that the multinational was being 
undermined by Greek Cypriots to damage the northern Cypriot economy and 
ultimately Turkey itself.

In the letter sent on Mr Nadir’s 
behalf in September 1990, the late President expressed his concerns as 
Polly Peck employed thousands of people in Turkey and Northern Cyprus.

Poly Peck’s (PPI) collapse would 
hinder the finding of a lasting solution to the Cyprus question as both 
sides needed economies on a parity with each other, the court heard.

The Turkish finance minister Gunes 
Taner then wrote 16 days later to then Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
asking for more time to examine what support the Turkish government 
could provide to PPI.

However Asil Nadir, 71, giving 
evidence at his trial, said weeks later Mr Hurd issued an 'ultimatum' on
a Saturday afternoon in that if £100million was not forthcoming by 
Monday noon 'everything was over'.

Nadir told the court: 'There was an ultimatum to Turgut Ozal. It was a message from Douglas Hurd. It was a Saturday.

'The ultimatum was: "If by Monday noon we don’t have the £100million here, then everything is over".'

The disgraced tycoon told the Old 
Bailey yesterday that he was on the verge of saving his £2billion firm 
after securing £70million in loans from Turkish banks and cash from his 
own family.

Turkey wrote to then PM Margaret Thatcher, left, for help in securing Polly Peck's future, but days later her Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, right, issued an ultimatum demanding £100million in financing for the company, the court heard

Speaking for the first time since he 
returned to Britain in August 2010 to face trial, Nadir said the 
decision to place his company in administration was taken as he was 
flying back to Britain from Turkey before he managed to tell the board 
about the cash injection.

He boasted of Polly Peck: 'Towards the middle of 1990, it was one of the best-performing companies in the world.'

Nadir claimed the firm was not 
insolvent when it folded, saying: ‘I think it had a tremendous future 
and this attitude was shared by the top brokers and investors in this 
country and worldwide. Finance was available from Turkey.’

Following the collapse of the 
conglomerate in 1990 with debts of £550million, Nadir fled in a private 
plane as he faced trial for theft.

He said his health was left 'in 
tatters' after his offices were raided, his papers seized and mail 
tampered with with following the claim that he had tried to bribe a 
judge in his trial.

'I was a totally broken man. My health
was in tatters, my hope of a fair trial was in tatters, I had zero hope
of receiving a fair trial.'

He added: 'It was a frightening 
situation. I still remember the concerns and the fear the lordship 
[Justice Tucker] had in his face.

'I had laid all my hopes on getting an
independent trial but was very worried i would not. The judge's 
expression was not one that one wants to see.'

The corruption charges were later dropped.

Support: Asil Nadir, 71, and his 28-year-old second wife Nur, who watched from the back of the court. Nadir was giving evidence five months after the trial began

The tycoon spent nearly two decades in
his native northern Cyprus after allegedly stealing millions to splash 
out on Mayfair mansions, country estates, antiques, race horses, fast 
cars and gifts for his family.

But yesterday Nadir insisted that he 
was ‘not guilty’, suggesting the cash was sent to a subsidiary company 
in northern Cyprus to get better exchange rates when making new 
investments abroad.

He claimed he had been the victim of 
injustice and said he had ‘zero chance of a fair trial’ after being 
accused of bribing a High Court judge who was to oversee his trial back 
in 1993.

An inquiry was launched into claims 
that there had been attempts to bribe Mr Justice Tucker, jurors heard. 
But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was no credible evidence 
to support the allegations.

Speaking haltingly, Nadir was watched 
closely by his glamorous second wife Nur, 28, yesterday as he told how 
his health was wrecked after being sued by the administrators of Polly 
Peck, made bankrupt and put on trial.

‘I was a totally broken man. My health
was in tatters, my hope of a fair trial was in tatters, I had zero hope
of receiving a fair trial.

‘I could drop dead at any minute,’ he said.

In a raid by bankruptcy officials in April 1993, all his papers including his defence papers were seized.

Two weeks later Nadir left Britain on 
May 4. He is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to 
£33million and $2.5million.

But Prosecutor Philip Shears, QC has 
told the jury the ‘much bigger picture’ is that he stole £150million 
from the major international conglomerate which had over 200 
subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure.

Nadir, of Belgravia, central London, denies theft.

The trial continues.
