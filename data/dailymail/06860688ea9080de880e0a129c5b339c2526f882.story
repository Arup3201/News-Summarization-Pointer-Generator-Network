Kerry Kennedy, the best friend and sister-in-law of Mary Kennedy, who committed suicide last week, has written about Mary's life-long battle with depression. 

The sister of Robert F Kennedy Jr said that she had known Mary for 37 years - and throughout that time she had struggled with mental illness.

Mrs Kennedy, 52, was struggling with debt and depression before she was found dead at her home in Bedford, New York last week.

She had been embroiled in a bitter divorce battle with her estranged husband who had taken to appearing at public events with their four children and his new girlfriend, 46-year-old actress Cheryl Hines. 

Documents showed she was facing a $32,000 lawsuit from American Express, though this was dropped following her death.

Kerry Kennedy, who introduced Mary to her future husband, wrote in the New York Post: 'Mary didn’t ask for this disease, she never deserved it, and she took every step, from those prescribed by doctors to looking to God, to try and find a way out of it.

'Mary recognized part of her was broken. As her husband, my brother Bobby, who spent years and untold efforts trying to rescue her from her depression, said in his eulogy, Mary would be distressed to know so many of her friends feel they should have done more to save her.'

She added that her sister-in-law would have wanted her death to inspire efforts to fight the battle against the disease.

Kerry Kennedy, is the seventh of the 11 children of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.

She went on to say that her sister-in-law endured 'unbearable pain' for the sake of her four children - Conor, 18, Kyra, 17, Finn, 15, and 11-year-old Aiden.

In recent months, Kerry Kennedy had grown close to her brother's new partner - Curb  Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines.

A photo posted to Twitter by Kerry showed a grinning Glenn Close, another close friend of Mary's, side-by-side with Mr Kennedy and his girlfriend.

Robert Kennedy Jr's girlfriend boasted about their relationship online in the weeks leading up to his estranged wife's suicide.

Cheryl Hines posted Twitter messages that showed she had all but taken the place of Mary Richardson Kennedy.

She had appeared on Mr Kennedy's arm at galas and events held by Riverkeeper, the environmental protection group of which he is vice chairman.

Her tweets also suggested she had also become close with two of Mrs Kennedy's best friends, sister-in-law Kerry Kennedy and the actress Glenn Close.

She even told her followers about how she had been talking about sport with the Kennedys' youngest son Aiden. A post from February 5 read: 'Rabid, unhinged New England zealotry by 10-yr-old Aidan Kennedy has nearly turned me into Pats fan.'

These are the pictures which likely sent Mary over the edge  as it appeared Cheryl Hines was trying to hijack her life by growing close to her children, left, and even boasting about her friendship with Glenn Close, below

Ms Hines deleted her Twitter account around the time of Mrs Kennedy's death - but by then the messages had already been archived by social media search engine Topsy.

The actress proudly told the world about her new life with her boyfriend, the lawyer son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy.

Mary Kennedy was said to have found it 'humiliating' when her husband and children appeared with Ms Hines at the Riverkeeper Annual Fisherman's Ball last month.

The blonde sitcom star also went with Mr Kennedy, 58, to Glenn Close's birthday party on April 15.

Mrs Close had been firm friends with Mrs Kennedy and even sang at her funeral on Saturday.

On April 28, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture of Cheryl Hines and her brother eating with singer Jackson Browne after an education fundraiser, along with the message: 'Cheryl and Jackson were amazing on stage and off.'

A spokeswoman for Ms Hines said the actress's 'thoughts and prayers are with the family'.

Earlier this week tensions between Mr Kennedy and his late wife's relatives resulted in the Richardson family holding their own private memorial service after all but one of them stayed away from the funeral he arranged.

The service in New York City followed a legal dispute in which Mrs Kennedy's brother Thomas Richardson, a lawyer, tried to stop her estranged husband claiming her body.

But the judge ruled in Mr Kennedy's favour, also awarding him full custody of his children and the whole of their mother's $4million estate.

After just one of the Richardson siblings attended the funeral on Saturday, other family members and friends arranged a 'celebration' of Mrs Kennedy's life at The Standard Hotel in Manhattan.

At the 200-strong memorial, there was no talk of demons or sadness but only the 'light and love that Mary brought into a room'.

Her widower was not invited, and took their four children to stay with their grandmother in Florida.

At the funeral on Saturday, Robert delivered a tearful eulogy which seemed to distance himself from any blame in Mary's suicide, saying she had a 'sadness that kicked her and chased her'.

He also said that his late wife suffered from depression long before her 1994 marriage and Kerry Kennedy said 'she struggled from the time I met her when she was 15'.

But Mary's close friends dispute this.

'Battling demons? That's hyperbolic language,' Carole Radziwill told People magazine. 'I didn't see anything close to that.

'She truly believed in the goodness of people. In the end that was her undoing.'

Another friend said: 'Mary did not have a history of depression. She became a troubled person because of the divorce.'
