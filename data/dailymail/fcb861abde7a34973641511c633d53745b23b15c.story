Jack Grealish has been allowed to leave the Republic of Ireland Under 21 squad to discuss a new contract at Aston Villa.

The 19-year-old has withdrawn from international duty in an effort to resolve outstanding issues regarding his future with Chelsea monitoring developments.

Grealish is expected to commit to an extension at Villa Park, allowing him to remain at the club he supported as a boy.

England are also hoping that the talented midfielder can be persuaded to switch allegiance before making a competitive senior appearance for Ireland, with U21 coach Gareth Southgate looking to bring him into his ranks.

Ireland’s Under 21 boss Noel King said: ‘The facts are that he is in contract talks with Aston Villa and they have reached an important stage.

‘His deal is up at the end of the year and his future is of paramount importance to him. So you can see why they would want to sort that matter out.

‘I accept Jack’s reasons for withdrawing and understand it. I have no issue with it.’
