Free birth control dramatically lowers rates of abortions and teen births, a large study has revealed.

Only 6.3 teenagers in every 1,000 given their choice of contraception get pregnant, compared with 34 per 1,000 nationwide, U.S. researchers found.

If birth control options were free, one abortion in 79 to 137 could be prevented, said scientists in St Louis, Missouri.

More than 9,000 women in the city were given their choice of contraceptive at no charge.

When cost was not an issue, women flocked to the most effective 
contraceptives - the implanted options, which typically cost hundreds of
dollars.

The women, many of them poor or uninsured, experienced far fewer unintended pregnancies, reported Dr Jeffrey Peipert of Washington University in St Louis.

There were much lower rates of abortion, too, with 4.4 to 7.5 abortions per 1,000 women in the study, compared with 13.4 to 17 abortions per 1,000 women in the St Louis region and 20 per 1,000 women nationally.

The findings of the study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology come as millions of U.S. women are 
beginning to get access to contraception without copayment under President 
Barack Obama's health care law.

Sound investment: Women given their choice on contraception gravitate towards the most effective methods, researchers found

Women's health specialists said the study, which ran from 2008 to 2010,  foreshadows that policy's potential impact.

Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said: 'As a society, we want to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortion rates.

'This study has demonstrated that having access to no-cost contraception helps us get to that goal.'

Dr. James T. Breeden, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, described the results as an 'amazing improvement'.

'I would think if you were against abortions, you would be 100 per cent for contraception access,' he added.

The law requires that contraceptives be available for free for women enrolled in most workplace insurance plans from January 1. 

Controversial issue: Millions of women are beginning to get access to free contraception under President Barack Obama's new healthcare plans

The policy is among the law's most contentious provisions because it exempts churches that oppose contraception but requires religious-affiliated organisations, such as colleges or hospitals, to provide the coverage for their workers.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and many conservative groups say that violates religious freedom, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has voiced similar criticism.

This week, a federal judge in St Louis dismissed a lawsuit challenging the contraception mandate. Nearly three dozen similar suits have been filed around the country.

Jeanne Monahan of the conservative Family Research Council suggested contraceptive use can encourage riskier sexual behaviour.

'Obama administration's contraception mandate may ultimately cause more unplanned pregnancies since it mandates that all health plans cover contraceptives, including those that the study's authors claim are less effective,' she said.

Nearly half of the nation's six million-plus pregnancies each year are unintended. An estimated 43 per cent of them end in abortion, with low-income women far more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy than their wealthier counterparts.

'We shouldn't have, in my view, a tiered system where the women with money can get family planning and the women without cannot,' said Dr Peipert, noting that 39 per cent of the women in his study had trouble paying basic expenses.

About half of unplanned pregnancies occur in women who use no contraception. As for the other half, condoms can fail and so can birth control pills or other shorter-acting methods if the woman forgets to use them or can't afford a refill.

Implanon is an implant inserted under the skin of the arm that prevents pregnancy for three years.

An IUD, a tiny T-shaped device inserted into the uterus, can last for five to 10 years, depending on the brand, although it can be removed.

Only about five per cent of U.S. women use long-acting contraceptives, far fewer than in other developed countries.

Dr Peipert believes this is because insurance has not always covered the higher upfront cost to insert them and because doctors do not always mention these methods.

Three-quarters of his study participants chose an IUD or Implanon, and a year later 85 per cent were sticking that choice - compared to about half who had initially chosen the pill, patch or other shorter-acting method.
