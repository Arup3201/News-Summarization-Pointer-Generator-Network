For decades, they have  provided a lifeline for pensioners and low-income shoppers looking to pick up second-hand goods for a snip.

But charity shops have now been accused of abandoning their traditional clientele by selling used items for hundreds of pounds.

Many have effectively become mini-boutiques offering cast-off designer clothes and accessories, as well as high-end art and books, at prices beyond the means of most hard-pressed consumers.

Cancer Research UK are charging £250 for a faux-fur coat and £200 for an Alpaca wool coat

Shoppers have complained that some of the second-hand goods on sale cost nearly the same as buying them brand new.

The rising prices come amid fears that an increase in the number of charity shops is fuelling the decline of the British high street by forcing existing retailers out. The country now has 10,000 charity shops, which enjoy generous tax breaks not available to other shopkeepers.

Many of the items on sale at the weekend, while not quite as expensive as they would be new, were still priced beyond the reach of most elderly or low-income customers.

Goods available at Oxfam on London’s Marylebone High Street included a £140 dusty pink Hugo Boss skirt suit and £100 gold Orciani belt with a large embellished buckle. At Cancer Research UK in Hampstead, North London, a brown faux-fur jacket was going for £250.

At an Oxfam store in Cambridge a signed print by painter Sir William Russell Flint was on sale for £249.99.

Another of the charity’s shops in the city was charging £20 for a Nina Ricci perfume bottle – even though it was empty.

The high prices prompted complaints from shoppers out looking for bargains. In Cambridge, retired teacher Giselle Harker, 75, said: ‘Charity shops are far too expensive now. Things are overpriced – especially in Oxfam. I find the Salvation Army is the only good charity shop now.’

Marsh Ryles, a 62-year-old quality manager from Cambridge, said: ‘You can’t get the bargains you used to be able to.

‘Now they’ll charge £25 for a pair of men’s Clarks shoes that have been worn. It is ridiculous.’

A recent thread on parenting site Mumsnet also complained about the soaring cost of charity shops. One person commented: ‘The problem is they’re doing themselves out of business.

‘I think that most people consider a reasonable price for a used item of clothing/books to be around a third of what it cost new. If they overcharge, things will remain unsold and the charity makes nothing.’

Despite rising prices, Oxfam’s network of nearly 700 shops has seen profits plunge by £17.6million in the last year amid hard times for all High Street stores.

Ian Matthews, its head of retail, said: ‘All our shop managers have the flexibility to set their own prices, using their judgment and some guidance, to decide what prices and products will best suit customers in their location.’
