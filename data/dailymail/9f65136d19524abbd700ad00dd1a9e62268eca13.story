Keith Cutler, 63, refused to discuss the case yesterday at Winchester Crown Court

The judge who sent Lewis Gill 
to prison for just four years did not respond to criticism of what has 
been called an ‘extremely lenient’ sentence.

Keith
 Cutler, 63, refused to discuss the case yesterday at Winchester Crown 
Court where he spent the day hearing a trial into an alleged conspiracy 
to commit blackmail.

The Mail was told by a court usher: ‘He has refused to talk about the case.’

The judge has however previously spoken about his approach to sentencing.

He
 has said in an interview: ‘Every offence has its different features, 
every mitigation has its own strengths and all those elements are 
brought into sentencing.’

He
 added: ‘Some cases get to you. When I come out of court, I say “That’s 
it. I’ve made my decision.  If I am wrong the Court of Appeal will deal 
with it”.’

The father 
of two, who is a lay canon at Salisbury Cathedral, has also defended his
 sometimes controversial approach to the legal process.

This
 was most notable in his handling of the inquest into the shooting of 
Mark Duggan, where he held a 20-second silence to commemorate the 
gangster’s death.

The judge 
admits that he enjoys having the power to show leniency but he reacted 
angrily to ministerial criticism of ‘soft’ sentencing back in 2006 when 
he was secretary of the Council of Circuit Judges.

Mr Young (left), who suffered from Asperger's 
Syndrome, and had the 
social skills of a 14-year-old. Gill (right) 
pleaded guilty to  charge of manslaughter and was jailed for 
four-and-a-half years

In
 October 2004, he handed teenager Louis Moroncini an 18-month 
supervision order for striking Beverley Brennan round the head with a 
4ft wooden pole during a robbery.

Judge
 Cutler told the defendant: ‘You know, and I know, that you richly 
deserve custody and you would have got three years. 

'But you must know 
that if you fail me and go wrong on this order, you will be back before 
the courts.’

After the 
hearing, nursery nurse Mrs Brennan said: ‘When the judge was passing the
 sentence, I had to leave the courtroom because I started having a panic
 attack.

This is the shocking moment Andrew Young was punched by Lewis Gill - Mr Young died of head injuries a day later in hospital

Mr Young was attacked by Gill after the 40-year-old became involved in an argument with his friend

Gill, 20, can be seen to walk away after looking back to see his victim lying motionless on the ground

‘I know he’s got a curfew, but I’ll still have that worry that he could go out.’

In
 September 2004, Abdel Atif Gholam, 29, an Afghan refugee who had no 
licence or insurance when he veered on to the wrong side of the road and
 killed a motorcyclist, was jailed by Judge Cutler for just two years.

The judge lives in a sprawling six-bedroom detached house in the heart of the English countryside.

Situated
 off a quiet lane, the £1million property offers picturesque views and 
has a well-tended garden packed with tall trees and ancient woodland.
