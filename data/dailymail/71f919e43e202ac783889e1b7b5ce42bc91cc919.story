An entirely new species of bear related to giant pandas has been found - in Spain.

The bear would have had a dark coat with white spots in its chest, around its eyes - and would have been smaller than any bear species today. 

The bear was identified from fossil teeth, and is thought to have roamed Europe 11 million years ago.

A Spanish team of scientists, among whom are researchers at the National Museum of Natural Sciences, has described a new fossil species in the area around Zaragoza.

Agriarctos beatrix was a small plantigrade omnivore and was genetically related to giant pandas, according to the authors.

Researchers at the National Museum of Natural Sciences and University of Valencia, suggest that this plantigrade lived during the Miocene, 11 million years ago.

‘This kind of bear was small, even smaller than the specimens of Malayan sun bear, the smallest found today. It probably didn't exceed 60 kilograms of weight,’ explains Juan Abella, a researcher at the Department of Paleobiology MNCN -CSIC and first author of the study, published in Geological Survey.

Despite having only found fossil teeth, scientists say the creature should have had dark coat with white spots located mainly in the chest, around the eyes and possibly the closest to the tail .

‘This pattern is considered primitive for the bears, similar to the giant panda, in fact, which have such large white spots that appear to be white with black spots,’ says Abella.

Agriarctos beatrix, Ursidae f would have been an animal that lived in the forest and would have had more sedentary habits that bears more hunters like brown or polar.

It probably escaped predators by climbing trees.

'Its diet would have been similar to the Malayan sun bear and spectacled that feed almost exclusively on fruit and vegetables and occasionally some small vertebrates, insects, honey and carrion,’ said the expert.

‘We determined it was a different species from those described so far based on morphological differences and the size of the teeth found, says the scientist. We have compared with species of the genus (Agriarctos) and the like from the same period (e Indarctos Ursavus). ‘

'The causes that led to their extinction yet to be determined but ‘most likely is forests giving way to more dry, open areas - and the occurrence of similar species that were larger and more competitive,’ says Abella.
