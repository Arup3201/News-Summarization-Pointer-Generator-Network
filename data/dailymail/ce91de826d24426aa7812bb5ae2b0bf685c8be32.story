There was sufficient proof that former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had sex with an underage nightclub dancer in exchange for cash and jewellery a court in Italy has heard.

New documents released to a Milan court today show that prosecutors were satisfied that Berlusconi had sex with Karima El Mahroug knowing she was underage - a consensus which led to his conviction in for using underage prostitutes earlier this year.

The court handed Berlusconi a seven-year jail sentence in June for abuse of office and paying for sex with a minor.

But although the judgement was made public at the time, the reasons behind conviction have remained secret until now.

But in an explosive document released today it is revealed that the court found 'it is proved that the defendant had sexual relations with Miss El Mahroug - known as Ruby the Heartstealer -  in exchange for considerable sums of money and other items such as jewellery.'

Judges also concluded that the disgraced politician was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the 
desires of the defendant... staging lap dances and stripteases'.

Following the high profile court case in June the three-time premier was found guilty of having sex with a minor and for abuse of office in trying to cover it up, but he still has two levels of appeal before the conviction and eventual punishment is confirmed by Italian courts.

And the case involving Miss El Mahroug is just the latest in a long line of scandals that has seen the 77-year-old former leader rarely out of the Italian courts in the last few years.

In August the disgraced politician lost his final appeal over a fraud conviction which handed him a four-year jail term.

As a result he faces the loss of his senate seat for 24 months under a ruling by an appeals court in his home town of Milan.

Under a 2012 law, anyone convicted to more than two years in prison cannot hold or run for office for six years.

It is the second political ban process to be set in motion following Berlusconi's failed appeal this summer.

Even before his conviction over Miss El Mahroug Berlusconi was already at risk of being kicked out of parliament under this law, as a result of a  five-year political ban for a previous tax fraud conviction.

However, the court was ordered by Italy's highest judges to reassess the length of the ban after prosecutors admitting errors in sentencing.

Mr Berlusconi's legal team have already pledged to appeal the two-year ban to Italy's highest criminal court - a move that could be rendered futile if the six-year expulsion is already in place.

If approved by parliament, the ban will prevent Berlusconi from wholly participating in new elections - but he could remain the titular head of his party without holding political office.

And shockingly Italian polls repeatedly show that many would still vote for him despite his outragous personal life.

But despite losing his appeal the media tycoon is unlikely to see the inside of a jail any time soon.

His four year sentence has already been reduced to one year - under an amnesty for crimes committed before 2006 -  because of his age and he has opted for the cushier choice of 12 months' community service.

This means that although he will have to join other convicts in carrying out menial tasks, such as cutting the grass in public parks, painting sheltered accommodation or picking up litter he will not be punished with any form or imprisonment or even house arrest.

But the conviction poses a serious threat to his decades-long political career and Berlusconi has threatened repeatedly to bring down Prime Minister Enrico Letta's broad left-right coalition government if the Senate votes to expel him from parliament on Nov. 27.

It's not all bad news though as the former premier did eventually find one court on his side a judge in Monza has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £1.2million a month.

He had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife Veronica Lario, whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage, a cool £2.5million a month.

Berlusconi was famously divorced in 2009 by Miss Lario after she saw him photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party.

At the time she said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties.

Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling another woman - a guest at a TV awards dinner - that he wanted to marry her instead.

'If I wasn't married, I would marry you right away, ' he told showgirl turned politician Mara Carfagna.

Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25.

He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44.

Last month he reportedly married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel.

The three-time Italian premier, who is nearly 50 years older than his bride, wed former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 28, at a church inside his palatial villa near Milan in early October.

The couple, who met when Miss Pascale was a teenage activist in Berlusconi's his Forza Italia party, wed despite a string of allegations that their relationship is ‘a sham’.

Miss Pascale is seeking Euro 10million damages after a TV station broadcast claims by Bulgarian actress Michele Bonev that she is in fact a lesbian. She says the comments are defamatory.
