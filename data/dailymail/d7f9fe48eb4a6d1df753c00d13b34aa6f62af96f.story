The 'amputee victim' in a controversial ad warning against the dangers of drinking too many sugary drinks - who actually has two normal legs - has revealed his shock at seeing himself in the campaign.

Cleo Berry, 27, of Los Angeles, California, is shown in a hard-hitting New York City advert about an overweight man who lost a leg below the knee because too many fizzy drinks led to an amputation.

But Mr Berry, who was paid $500 to pose for photos in a studio in Manhattan, New York, several years ago, said he was in tears for a whole minute when he saw himself in the advert last week.

Big controversy: Cleo Berry, 27, of Los Angeles, California, is shown in a hard-hitting New York City advert about an overweight man who lost a leg below the knee because too many fizzy drinks led to an amputation.

‘I was beyond shocked,’ Mr Berry told 
the New York Times. ‘I cried at my computer screen for, like, a minute. I
said: “Oh my gosh, they even gave me crutches. Come on, people”.

No amputation: The original picture of Mr Berry from a photo agency shows he has both legs intact

‘I’ve always wanted my photo in an ad 
all over the city, but I was hoping it would be for a TV show or 
something, not this,’ he added, saying he would now like to do a 
commercial for a fizzy drinks firm.

After the advert was released it 
emerged that the man featured in the ad - which then turned out to be Mr
Berry - actually has two legs and one of them was edited out by the 
advertising agency.

The actor told the New York Times he 
is happy for the city to educate people on diabetes, but was not 
impressed by their use of an edited image of someone who was not a real 
victim of the disease.

Mr Berry's IMDB film profile reveals 
he was in an episode of the TV series House last year, called Out of the
Chute. He has also been in short films and was a stunt man in ‘The 
Strongest Man on Earth’.

New York City's health department 
confirmed that his leg was removed to make the point of the campaign. 
The photo came from a company that supplies stock images to advertising 
firms.

But city officials were slammed for 
not revealing that he was not a real amputee victim and did not have 
diabetes. The photographer who took the picture, Morten Smidt, did not 
know Mr Berry.

Mr Smidt told the New York Times last 
week that he had not seen the advertisement but said of it: 'Well, it is
an illustration now, clearly not the picture I did.'

When the adverts were released earlier
this month, fizzy drink manufacturers were quick to attack it, saying 
it painted an 'inaccurate picture' of what the beverage does to the 
body.

Real: The health agency insists that another anti-smoking campaign featuring a woman called Marie from the Bronx was a true-life portrayal of someone who had their finger tips amputated because of smoking

True: They also insisted the man with the voice box is a real-life throat cancer victim

But New York City health chiefs - and 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg - insist it is a necessary shock tactic. They 
said that in 2006, almost 3,000 New Yorkers with diabetes were 
hospitalised for amputations.

More than 1,000 of the posters were 
put up in subways across the city. But Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for 
the American Beverage Association, said the campaign was over the top.

'Instead of utilising scare tactics, 
the beverage industry is offering real solutions like smaller portioned 
containers and new calorie labels,’ Mr Friedman said.

But in a press conference Mr Bloomberg
said: 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their 
legs? Or do you want to show them what happens so that they won't lose 
their legs?’

Other city ads feature a smoker who 
developed throat cancer at 39 and now has to talk through a voice box 
and a woman called Marie who had the ends of her fingers amputated because of 
smoking.

Defence: New York City health chiefs - and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured - insist it is a necessary shock tactic. They said that in 2006, almost 3,000 New Yorkers with diabetes were hospitalised for amputations

‘This issue isn’t about one actor but 
rather the 700,000 New Yorkers who struggle with diabetes, which kills 
1,700 people a year,’ a health department spokesman told the New York 
Times.

'I was beyond shocked. I cried at my computer screen for, like, a minute. I said: "Oh my gosh, they even gave me crutches. Come on, people"'

Cleo Berry, advert model

‘And (it) causes amputations in 
another 3,000,’ he added. ‘Advertising to warn the public about health 
concerns saves lives, and we will continue our efforts to warn New 
Yorkers about diabetes.’

New York City is one of the most 
forthright places in the U.S. when policing the health of citizens. Mayor Bloomberg has already banned smoking in public 
places like parks and beaches.

Adverts already running on the New 
York City subway show how many miles a person would have to walk to work
off the calories from fatty kinds of coffees.

New Yorkers have also been forced to 
look at an anti-obesity advert showing people drinking a glass full of 
human fat to dissuade them from eating junk food.
