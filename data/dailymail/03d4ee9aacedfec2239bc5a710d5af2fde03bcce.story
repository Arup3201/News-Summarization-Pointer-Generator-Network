Apple's new iBooks Author software lets anyone create eBooks full of pictures, videos and interactive elements

At Apple's New York education event, the technology giant has unveiled a new do-it-yourself iBooks Author app which lets anyone create rich, visual books.

The books can have galleries of pictures, video, interactive images and 3D images dropped directly into the text.

The new app is free and works with computers running Apple's Mac OS X.

The books will work on iBooks software on iPad.

Users can import text directly from other applications such as Microsoft Word, and also add elements using web programming language such as HTML.

The software automatically breaks up text and formats it as a book.

There is even an option to add a glossary.

'Traditionally creating books is really hard, but we think we’ve changed all that with iBooks Author,' said Roger Rosner, Apple’s VP of Productivity Applications.

The new app is freely available.

The company announced the app at an education event - and the 'creation kit' should allow textbook companies to create hi-tech colourful textbooks.

Jobs described textbooks as an '$8 billion a year industry ripe for digital destruction', in conversations with his biographer Walter Isaacson.

Jobs
himself had reportedly been in conversation with major textbook 
publishers such as Pearson before his death - and insiders say that the 
new Apple textbook software might be built around blueprints created by 
Jobs himself.

Bill
Goodwyn, head of Discovery Inc's education department, said that he had
talked to Apple about new approaches to the textbook industry.

'Apple is a very disruptive force, and in education, that's a good thing,' he said.

Amazon
already publishes many university-level textbooks via its Kindle eBook 
format - but many tech insiders say that Apple's ability to deliver 
textbooks mixed with video, pictures and music could be a critical 
advantage.
