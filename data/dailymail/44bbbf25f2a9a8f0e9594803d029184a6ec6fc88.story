The federal government's plan to boost its refugee intake by 7,500 has been overshadowed by claims that officials mistreated two pregnant Iranian asylum seekers who refused to get off a bus at a Darwin detention centre 

The refugee increase will occur over four years and bring Australia's overall humanitarian intake to about 18,750. The move is expected to cost the government an estimated $100 million, which will be funded by savings within the immigration portfolio.

It is one of a raft of measures that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has agreed to as part of a deal with Senate crossbenchers to win  support for his bill to resurrect temporary protection visas.

Mr Morrison was forced to defend accusations that officials mistreated two heavily pregnant Iranian refugees who refused to get off a bus parked at Wickham Point detention centre 40km south of Darwin on Saturday.

Immigration minister Scott Morrison denies the pregnant women and their families were mistreated describing them as 'malicious claims by asylum activists'

Mr Morrison said the welfare of the two heavily pregnant women, their husbands and one son was monitored and they had access to food, water, amenities, toilets and health professionals as they batted with authorities over the right to live in the community ahead of the births.

But Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said the air conditioning  was turned off on the bus during the stand-off which started at 10pm on Saturday when the women, Maryam and Tahere, refused to get off the bus. 

'On Monday, both pregnant women fainted after the bus was intentionally allowed to heat up,' Mr Rintoul said on Wednesday.

Maryam's husband collapsed and was taken to the medical centre in the facility, he added.

Mr Rintoul also disputes the time frame for the end of the stand-off, saying the two women 'were dragged off the bus' between 5.30pm and 6pm on Monday, rather than Tuesday morning as reported.

The second man, Adnan, alleges he was physically restrained by four guards as his wife Maryam was taken off.

However, Mr Morrison rejected these claims stating that the department and detention service provider, Serco, had acted appropriately towards the women and their families. 'My understanding is they're fine," he said.

The 7,500 increase in Australia's refugee intake will be rolled out over four years.

'The government denies claims of cruelty and mistreatment of the individuals in the strongest possible terms,' he said in a statement. 'These are yet more malicious claims by asylum activists.'

The two families had been on Nauru for 15 months, and had lived in the community for part of that time after being recognised as refugees. 

Mr Morrison said the government will 'hard-wire' its refugee intake commitment into a 'disallowable instrument,' so the intake can't be reduced without Senate agreement.

Senator Nick Xenophon's amendments were also backed by the government and are expected to result in better alignment with the UNHCR when it comes to refugee assessments. 

The government's fast-tracking process will be limited to 30,000 cases left over from Labor government. A total of 25,000 asylum seekers now on bridging visas will be allowed work rights.

Mr Morrison's announcement came after reports that his bill was set to be defeated in the Senate.

'The ultimate determination of this bill is in the hands of the Senate, it is not for me to commentate on the position of individual senators,' Mr Morrison said.

The bill would also boost powers to turn back boats and head off a High Court challenge and create a five-year safehaven enterprise visa for genuine refugees. 

Senator Nick Xenophon's amendments were also backed by the government that will result in better alignment with the UNHCR when it comes to refugee assessments including greater efficiency which is free of bias
