A Texas university professor is adjusting to life in a dumpster as he studies whether people are happier living a simpler lifestyle.

Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated environmental science professor, has now been housed in the 36-square-foot container for more than nine months. 

He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer.

Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in this dumpster for seven months now and says he may yet stay for another year

The dumpster was large enough to fit a bed and a few pieces of Mr Wilson's (pictured) furniture

But it was just an empty barren space before he filled it with his possessions

Mr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas,  said it has now been without its pitfalls.

'The most terrifying night was the second night. 

It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,' Wilson told ABC13.

He added the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster.

The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter.

Having now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project.  

Wilson posted a picture of him and his girlfriend (pictured) with the comment, 'Honey, I'm home. This place looks like a dump' just before he moved in earlier this year

Wilson is moving through different stages.

Phase I, which launched on February 4, 2014, included living with no amenities, including sourcing water from Lady Bird Lake, according to his website.

Phase II of the experiment will include a connection to the electrical grid, household appliances, and most amenities found in a modern home. 

Phase III of the experiment, dubbed 'The Über Dumpster,' will launch in the spring of 2015. 

Phase III aims to combine the best aspects of the first two phases so that all the amenities of modern life will be included, operating with the smallest ecological footprint possible.

Maintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls

Designs may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower 

'I'm not as concerned about the shower,' he told The Atlantic, 'but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.'

Currently, he uses facilities at the university's gym, but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. 

'You don't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,' he explained. 

After the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.

Wilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.

'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.

So when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' 

Despite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster.

However, the dumpster wasn't ready at that stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in, in Feburary. 

'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.  

He said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life.

'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.

'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'
