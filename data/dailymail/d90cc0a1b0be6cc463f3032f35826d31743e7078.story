Mick Jagger was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder in the wake of L’Wren Scott’s death, court papers reveal.

The Rolling Stones frontman has been largely silent about his feelings since his girlfriend of 13 years hanged herself on March 17.

But privately he was left so upset that he was told by a doctor not to perform for a month, according to papers filed in an £8million battle between the band and their insurers.

The Stones were forced to postpone the Australia and New Zealand leg of their world tour when Miss Scott died – but their insurers refused to pay out, saying their policy did not cover suicide.

L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses

Acute traumatic stress disorder can cause flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of guilt and emotional numbness.

If these symptoms continue for more than a month it becomes post-traumatic stress disorder, often associated with soldiers returning from war zones.

In a High Court filing as part of the fight with their insurers, the band state: ‘Upon learning of Miss Scott’s death, Sir Mick Jagger became stricken with grief.

‘Following examination by his physicians, Sir Mick Jagger was diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder. His physicians advised [him] not to perform for at least 30 days.’

The Stones had taken out a £15million policy to cover the costs if they were forced to cancel their tour.

But the underwriters claim that because Miss Scott committed suicide, they do not have to pay out the £8million the band are demanding.

The disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into Jagger’s feelings. He has so far given only one brief interview about Miss Scott’s suicide. In a statement, he said he would ‘never forget her’, adding: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.’

Her death has resulted in a bitter insurance battle on two continents, with lawsuits filed in the US and in London.

Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death and was advised by doctors not to perform for at least 30 days

In July, the Stones sued their insurers in the High Court, alleging that they had ‘failed and refused’ to pay the £8million, and seeking interest and costs on top of that sum.

The eight insurers are led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London.

They responded by claiming that Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ and so did not qualify for a payout.

They also claimed it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’ that was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’.

A pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout.

The insurers appeared to dispute the idea that Jagger, 71, was so deeply upset, and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination.

They wrote: ‘It does not appear that Sir Mick Jagger was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder.’

Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren

The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life

The only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor, who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient, the papers state. 

Last month, the insurers filed a lawsuit in New York’s Federal Court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott’s will, the New York City medical examiner, and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant, in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott’ as well as her general mental health, or an ‘actual or alleged suicide attempt’.

Meanwhile in Utah, where Miss Scott grew up, a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott’s brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state.

However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons.

Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide.

Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties.

There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her ‘devastated’, although Jagger’s spokesman denied this. Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones’ insurance policy.

Also on Jagger’s list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren.

The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy.

A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment.

Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment.

Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards

The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle.

Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered.

For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’.

More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either.

For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica.

The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.
