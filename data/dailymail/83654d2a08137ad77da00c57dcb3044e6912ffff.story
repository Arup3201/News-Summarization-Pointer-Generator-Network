Claims: James Kitson, 32, said a Tesco colleague scrawled 'JA Kitson is a deaf c***' on a toilet wall

A Tesco shelf stacker is suing the firm for almost £100,000 after claiming he was hounded out of his job for being deaf.

James Kitson, 32, walked out of his job of 15 years over bullying claims - including when a colleague scrawled 'JA Kitson is a deaf c***' on a toilet wall, a tribunal heard.

He said senior staff at the Warwick store refused to launch a proper investigation and passed him over for a promotion as part of a catalogue of claims. 

Mr Kitson appeared before Birmingham Employment Tribunal yesterday at the start of a two-week hearing.

Mr Kitson, from Southam, Warwickshire, said senior staff had ignored company policy to take into account his hearing problems, that mean he cannot hear anyone behind him. 

He is now suing Tesco for £97,400 compensation, claiming emotional distress caused by disability discrimination and bullying that caused him to leave the company.

He is also claiming breaches of EU working laws after saying he was forced to work back-to-back shifts less than 11 hours apart.

And he claims he was ignored for a new role because he lodged an official complaint against 'vindictive' bosses. 

He told the hearing  he began working at the Warwick branch while doing his A-levels in 1999 and had an exemplary record.

He had been promoted to be a team leader, still working on the shop floor, but things came to a head before he walked out in September.

'I would not normally use the men's toilets at work, but due to an abscess I needed to use them to sort it out every few hours,' he said.

'It was a Sunday so the store closed at 4pm that day and only staff were around after that.

'When I went in I noticed the words 'JA Kitston is a deaf c***' scratched into the back of the door.

'It had my middle initial in it, which is only available from official Tesco records so it had to be a member of staff.'

Exemplary: The tribunal heard Mr Kitson worked at this Tesco branch in Warwick since leaving school in 1999

He claimed his name was added to a list of people who needed to attend a meeting for a new contract - but when he turned up he found the name had been added by an unnamed colleague, and there was no contract waiting.

Store manager Owen Culshaw admitted he had never launched an official investigation into the graffiti incident.

He told the tribunal: 'I asked a colleague to look into it, to make some informal enquiries.

'I didn't see a point making it formal and interviewing everyone, because I did not think the chances of anyone admitting to doing it were very high.

'You are given a handbook when you join about equality. Everyone at Tesco gets one.

'It is not replaced when a new one comes out, but it is on everyone's file digitally so can be accessed.

Store manager Owen Culshaw said everyone had an equality handbook, adding: 'I didn't see a point making it formal and interviewing everyone, because I did not think the chances of anyone admitting to it were high'

'We have a disability policy book, but I haven't read it all, it is there to refer to. The book is over 3,000 pages long.

'When Mr Kitson had his last performance review he did not like the findings. I am told he ripped up the documents and walked out of the store there and then.'

Mr Kitson, who is representing himself, denied he had stormed out of the store and claimed line manager Paul Fisher had not given him time to prepare for the interview.

'Paul Fisher made the store an offensive environment to work in,' he added. 'I was victimised by Paul Fisher in the review.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on the specific allegations made against us as the hearing is ongoing. However, we are defending the claim and deny the allegations put to us. We take our responsibilities as an equal opportunities employer extremely seriously - everyone is welcome at Tesco'.

The tribunal continues.
