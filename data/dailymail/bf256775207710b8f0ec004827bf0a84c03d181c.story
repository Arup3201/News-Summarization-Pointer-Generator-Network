Broadcast television is getting smuttier this season with x-rated jokes and photos of genitals. 

While broadcast networks may be using sex to sell their shows in order to compete with cable networks like HBO, they are also ruffling the feathers of concerned viewers who are calling for censorship.

The Hollywood Reporter writes that the president of the Parents Television Council (PTC), Tim Winter, thinks the dirty humor is, 'absolutely inappropriate for primetime broadcast television.'

New Girl: In episodes of the show New Girl starring Zooey Deschanel, the characters use terms like 'sex fist' and also smoke drugs like marijuana 

To Winter's dismay, New Girl on Fox starring girl-next-door Zooey Deschanel had a fisting joke filled season premiere.

Deschanel's character repeatedly uses the catchphrase 'sex first,' a term she coined to describe her roommates desire to hook up at a wedding.

Other New Girl episodes feature characters doing marijuana and in one episode Deschanel dates a man with a micropenis.

'We got away with murder, The New Girl’s executive producer Brett Baer told The Hollywood Reporter.

Sex scenes: The season premiere of Scandal starring Kerry Washington opens with a sex scene between her and Scott Foley, just minutes after Charlie Brown aired on ABC 

'We've given broadcast standards a run for their money,' he said.

Another show on Fox called the Mindy Project has an entire episode dedicated to anal sex.

Mindy Kaling and Chris Messina spend an entire show slot on broadcast television debating whether or not Messina tried to engage in anal sex with Kaling.

The episode later references other nuanced sexual positions referred to as the 'necktie', 'ascot', and 'bagpipe'.

The president  of the Parents Television Council (PTC) says that shows on broadcast television have become too racy and should be censored

Fox isn't the only broadcast network featuring base humor in the hopes for bigger ratings.

The show Scandal on ABC started their season with a steamy sex scene between Kerry Washington and Scott Foley.

The PTC complained about the intimate embrace in Scandal which aired at 9, just minutes after the Charlie Brown Halloween Special.

The Hollywood Reporter says that a few weeks later the show had an episode in which the President's daughter is caught having sex with two boys online in an act called 'Eiffel Towering'.

'I have no intention of changing what's happening on Scandal at 9,' the show's writer Shonda Rhimes told The Hollywood Reporter in response to people trying to censor her.

'That will be interesting. I look forward to being censored.'

Rhimes' other show, How to Get Away with Murder, which airs on ABC at 10pm has an episode in which the character Viola Davis says, 'Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?'

Low rated shows like Mindy and the New Girl may be trying to add more dirty humor to jack up the ranking, but so far the tactic hasn't been working.

'As lines blur between broadcast, basic cable and premium cable, there may be a concentration of pushing sexual boundaries in certain shows,' said a top network executive.

'But it is hardly a mandate or a trend,' he added.

Tim Winter doesn't think the jokes are justified. 

'We have to start asking if some of these grey area instances really do cross the line,' said Winter of the PTC.

Network censors have been less stringent about pushing back and the FCC has been easier on fining shows.

'Hopefully, the FCC will levy a fine or two and let broadcasters know that the law is still in place and they have to respect it,' Winter said.
