The victim of a cannibal attack has spoken for the first time about his horrific injuries which left him blind and with severe wounds after flesh was torn from his face.

Ronald Poppo, 65, barely survived the frenzied attack by 31-year-old Rudy Eugene on May 26. Police were forced to shoot dead Eugene after he would not stop savaging his victim.

It was widely speculated that Eugene 
was on bath salts when he launched the assault - however toxicology 
tests last month only found marijuana in his system.

Mr Poppo told police officers, in a tape obtained by CBS: 'He just ripped me to ribbons. He chewed up my face. He plucked out my eyes. Basically that’s all there is to say about it.'

He later added: 'He mashed my face into the 
sidewalk. My face is all bent and mashed up... He was strangling me in wrestling holds at the same 
time he was plucking my eyes out.'

In the interview, the 65-year-old also 
expressed gratitude to the police officers who saved his life, saying if
it wasn't for them he would be in 'worse shape'.

The homeless man had undergone several surgeries at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Florida before being transferred to a local-term care center.

He told police that he had never met Eugene and does not know why he was attacked, contrary to reports that the pair had earlier met at a homeless shelter.

Mr Poppo told Miami police last month that Eugene was screaming before the attack, telling him he was going to die.

Mr Poppo also told his interviewers that Eugene appeared to have been frustrated about being unable to buy drugs on nearby Miami beach. 

The homeless man denied having done anything to provoke Eugene including earlier claims that he stole his Bible.

With the extent of his injuries, Mr Poppo appeared to be confused over certain details of the attack. He told police he thought Eugene had come from a car on the highway but CCTV proved this to be false.

He also thought Eugene was clothed when in fact he was naked when he launched the frenzied assault on the side of the highway.

Mr Poppo, who is originally from New York, had been living on the streets of Florida for the past 30 years, estranged from his family who thought he had committed suicide years before.

He is currently being cared for at the rehabilitation center as he adjusts to being blind.
