The Hey Joe mug can keep a freshly-brewed coffee at exactly the right temperature

Bleary-eyed workers up and down the country know the power of a freshly-brewed cup of coffee to get them through the start of the week. 

Now, to prevent queues of drowsy people lining coffee shop pavements, a group of Atlanta-based entrepreneurs has developed a device that can brew coffee on the go.

Not only that, but the system prepares the coffee to exactly the right temperature helping to prevent accidental burns as exhausted workers rush to get their caffeine fix.

This 0.9lb (408g) ‘Hey Joe’ device makes the coffee using small 30p (50 cents) pods that are placed into a tray at the bottom of the mug.

Water is poured into the upper compartment at any temperature where it is warmed by a battery-operated heating plate. 

Once the water reaches a certain temperature, it drips onto the pod and fills the bottom reservoir with coffee.

The hot plate continues to regulate the temperature based on a user’s preference.

One push of the button will see coffee 
brewed at 60°C (140° F), two pushes heats the coffee up to 68° C (155° 
F), while three pushes will prepare and serve a cold drip coffee.

‘We believe it is better to heat coffee up
 to the exact right temperature from the beginning rather than try to 
cool it down after the fact,’ co-found Jordan Warren wrote on the mug's website.

For non-coffee drinks, the mug (pictured) can also brew tea. A USB connection recharges the mug, and this will need to be done every three brews

This 0.9 lb (408 g) ‘Hey Joe’ device makes the coffee using small 30p (50 cents) pods (pictured) that are placed into a small tray at the bottom of the mug. 

The process takes a minute and a half for a cold drip, and around three minutes for hot, depending on how much liquid goes into the system.

‘Because your coffee is kept in a separate tray and encased by a coffee pod, there is little to no residue and it is only in the tray itself,’ said Warren.

The Hey Joe mug, which is currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign, can brew 0.4 litres of coffee in one go.

The team even made their pods out of biodegradable material with flowers seeds weaved into the fabric.

For non-coffee drinks, the mug can also brew tea. A USB connection recharges the mug, and this will need to be done every three brews.

‘Whether you're a working professional or a student, there is nothing worse than taking a sip from your travel thermos, only to find the coffee is lukewarm or cold,’ said Mr Warren. 

‘Now there is a travel-sized coffee mug that can brew your coffee for you anytime, anywhere to the perfect drinking temperature.’

A pledge of £29 ($49) on Kickstarter will get you the mug, while (£40) $69 will also send 40 pods of Hey Joe coffee.

The team hopes to begin shipping in November this year.

Health-related gadgets are all the rage these days, from smart wristbands to apps that track what you consume.

But a new device from San Francisco-based Mark One, called Vessyl, claims to be able to streamline the process by putting all the technology you need in a cup.

The product can accurately identify your drink, tell you how many calories you are consuming, let you know how hydrated you are, and alert you when it’s time to drink again. 

Under the surface is the computing power that givers the device its ‘smart’ functionality - although how it works exactly is being kept a closely-guarded secret by makers Mark One.

The technology enables the cup to recognise what liquid is poured inside from a catalogue of thousands.

It knows the content and make-up of the drink, and is therefore able to let you know exactly what you are putting into your body.

The cup can then be asked to display a particular set of data to aid you achieve certain goals, such as losing weight or regulating caffeine.
