This is the hilarious moment a panda was captured taking a tumble during what looks to be a daring attempt to escape its enclosure.

The furry fugitive can be seen trying to make its way across the bars of its play area.

However, instead of making a clean get away, the clumsy cub manages to lose its bearings and slips on to the back of its snoozing sibling.

Fallen at the first hurdle: The panda could not reach the set of railings and tumbled onto another dozing cub

Luckily, neither six-month-old panda received any injuries but the dozing youngster was not impressed at being awoken so suddenly.

The playful pair were spotted by photographer, David Jenkins, 41, who managed to get exclusive access to the new born pandas while working as a volunteer at Bifengxia Panda Reserve in Chengdu, China.

Mr Jenkins said: 'One of the baby pandas was to trying to climb from one set of bars to the other but its paws weren't long enough to reach the next set.

'There were no footholds and the panda slipped onto the sleeping baby panda, it woke the little one up and it was not happy about it!

'It was fast asleep at the time and let out a few little growls at being awoken so suddenly.

'It was only myself and my wife, Sandra, who managed to spot the hysterical moment and we both just burst out laughing.'

Mr Jenkins said he and his wife visited the nursery many times during their trip because 'there was always something funny happening.'

He said: 'The pandas were very playful, apart from climbing and exploring and there was a lot of wrestling going on.

'They had a lot of fur and are well padded, as well having an ability to roll whenever they landed to the break the impact of their falls.

'The pair were very entertaining, I'll never forget the time I spent with them.'
