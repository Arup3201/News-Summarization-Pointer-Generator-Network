Polish goalkeeping legend Jan Tomaszewski thinks Wojciech Szczesny won't play another game for Arsenal this season, and believes he should look for a loan move away from the Emirates.

Szczesny's last game for the Gunners came against Southampton on New Year's Day, but he was dropped after Sportsmail revealed that he had been fined after being caught smoking in the showers after the match.

David Ospina was brought into the team, and after three clean sheets in a row, he does not look like giving up his starting berth without a fight.

Tomaszewski, who is nicknamed 'The Man That Stopped England' after his impressive performance for Poland in a World Cup qualifier against the Three Lions in 1973, was in favour of Szczesny leaving Arsenal before the loan window closes.

'It seems to me that Adam Nawalka (Poland's national team coach) should go to London to find [him] a way out of the situation, because from what I know, Wojciech will not play again until the end of the competition,' Tomaszewski told Sportowefakty.

'Wojciech should look for a loan. He won't lose anything, he will continue to be bound by a contract with Arsenal, but will be able to count on regular gametime.' 

Since Szczesny's omission from the Arsenal starting line-up, Arsene Wenger's side have won three games in a row; 2-0 against Hull City in the FA Cup, 3-0 against Stoke City in the Premier League, and a huge win against Manchester City on Sunday afternoon.
