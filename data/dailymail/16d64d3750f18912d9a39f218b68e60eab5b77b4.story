Since turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze her eggs.

The TV star, who shot to fame after winning Alan Sugar's approval on the BBC reality show has made the tough decision after reaching her mid-thirties without finding The One. 

But the choice also centres around Michelle's successful career in business, which she believes would face a setback if she took time out right now to have children.

Since turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze her eggs. The Apprentice winner made the decision because of career ambitions, but also because she wants to find the right life partner without the pressure from her biological clock 

She made the revelation after Google and Apple's announcement this week that they would be providing financial support to female employees who wanted to freeze their eggs. 

Michelle said: 'We live in this society now where it used to be that women stayed at home, the chap was the breadwinner, but times have now changed because we have a choice.

'Lots of women want to stay at home, but I’m in a position now where I want to focus on my career. 

'I believe that I can achieve anything that I want in the workplace and the one thing that is restricting me is my biological clock

'It’s a mixture of three things, I have an awful lot that I want to achieve in my career, I haven’t met the right guy yet that I want to settle down with and also I feel like I’m just not ready.'

And the career woman is quick to dismiss any speculation that women who feel like this are lacking in maternal instinct.

She told This Morning earlier today: 'I absolutely want to be a mum.

'When I think my future, it absolutely involves family - family means the world to me, but I’m just not ready to be a mum.

'What I want is the choice.' 

Now in her mid-thirties, Michelle and her friends have reached a common age where conversation on nights out inevitably turns to one thing - motherhood. 

She said: 'I turned 35 a couple of days ago and the topic of who is going to have kids, when we’re going to have kids -  there are so many cocktails that (my friends and I) have drunk while discussing that topic. 

'You go round and round and it drives you mad.

'I don’t want that pressure in my life. I don’t want to meet a guy in a bar and instead of getting to know him, be trying to find out whether he wants kids, when he’d want them and his intentions for the future.' 

So Michelle is hoping that by freezing her eggs, she will manage to both alleviate the time pressures on her body clock, but also achieve all of her career ambitions before she finally settles down to have a family.  

She said: 'I want to be a mum when  I am still young enough to enjoy the kids, ideally for me it would be early forties.

'As a woman it’s really hard to decide when is the right time and who is the right person - freezing your eggs is almost an insurance policy.

Michelle appeared on This Morning today to talk about her decision 

'But hopefully life will move on and nature will take it’s course and I’ll meet someone who is awesome, settle down with them, have a family and probably not even use these eggs.'

Michelle believes that for these reasons, Apple and Google are right to offer to cover the procedure costs of up to £12,600 when it comes to freezing eggs. 

She said: 'There are so many people saying that they just want to control you as an employee, that’s ridiculous, this company asked what is important to their employees and this is what they came up with.

'Let’s get all of this in balance, Apple do all of those other things like childcare already.

'They provide adoption support, enhanced maternity leave, this is a package of benefits, it’s not an isolated package on its own. 

'But obviously anything has side effects and the thing people need to do is do their research. 

'People need to truly understand what it means, how it will affect you and how your life can revolve around that as well.

'We need to put this into perspective, not every woman is going to down tools tomorrow and go freeze their eggs, and I don’t think any company is suggesting that is what they should do, it’s just giving them a choice.'
