House Republicans have
 passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama 
granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as 
kids, with many calling the bill a dead-end as the Senate leaves for summer break.

The legislation that passed 216-192 late
 Friday could put more than 700,000 immigrants who've received temporary
 work permits in line for deportation.

It also would block Obama from awarding work permits to other immigrants here illegally.

House Republicans have passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as kids

The
 bill was supported by conservatives who demanded it as their price for 
backing a separate measure dealing with the crisis of unaccompanied 
minors flooding the border.

The Senate has already adjourned for Congress' summer recess so neither bill stands a chance of becoming law.

As CBS notes, President Barack Obama and Senate Democracts have said they won't even consider said legislation.

Obama called the move political theater 'just so they can check a box before they're leaving town for a month.

A day after 
GOP leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat, 
tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $694 
million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program 
created by Obama granting work permits to immigrants brought here 
illegally as kids.

The second bill also seemed designed to prevent the 
more than 700,000 people who've already gotten work permits under the 
program from renewing them, ultimately making them subject to 
deportation.

The spending bill passed 223-189 
late Friday, with only four Republicans voting "no" and one Democrat 
voting 'yes.' A vote on the second measure was expected later in the 
night.

'It's dealing with the issue that the 
American people care about more than any other, and that is stopping the
 invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country,' said Rep. 
Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. 'And we got to yes.'

But
 Obama said no. 'They're not even trying to solve the problem,' the 
president said. 'I'm going to have to act alone, because we do not have 
enough resources.'

Obama said he would 
reallocate resources where he could, while making clear his options were
 limited without congressional action.

The 
moves in the House came on what was to have been the first day of 
lawmakers' five-week summer recess, delayed by GOP leaders after their 
vote plans unexpectedly collapsed on Thursday.

Senators had already left
 Washington after killing their own legislation on the border crisis, so
 there was no prospect of reaching a final deal.

Rep. Steven King of Iowa, a leading immigration hardliner, said he was 'very satisfied' with the results

But three months before
 midterm elections, House Republicans were determined to show that they,
 at least, could take action to address the crisis involving tens of 
thousands of unaccompanied minors fleeing violence and poverty in 
Central America to cross illegally into South Texas.

'It
 would be irresponsible and unstatesmanlike to head home for the month 
without passing a bill to address this serious, present crisis on the 
border,' said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee.

To reach a deal, GOP leaders had to
 satisfy the demands of a group of a dozen or more conservative 
lawmakers who were meeting behind the scenes with Sens. Ted Cruz, 
R-Texas, and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and taking their cues from outside 
groups such as the Heritage Foundation that opposed earlier versions of 
the legislation.

These lawmakers objected to 
sending any more money to Obama without a strong stance against his 
two-year-old deportation relief program, which Republicans blame for 
causing the current border crisis by creating the perception that once 
here, young migrants would be allowed to stay - a point the 
administration disputes.

House GOP leaders 
agreed earlier in the week to hold a separate vote to prevent Obama from
 expanding the deportation relief program, but that didn't satisfy 
conservatives who held out for stronger steps.

Thursday
 night, those lawmakers huddled in the basement of the Capitol with new 
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., until coming up with a deal 
ending funding for the deportation relief program as well as making 
changes to the border bill aimed at ensuring the faster removal of the 
Central American migrant youths.

Friday morning, as the full Republican caucus met in the Capitol, conservative lawmakers were declaring victory.

'I'm very satisfied,' said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, the leading immigration hardliner in the House.

In
 the end Republicans only lost four of the most conservative members on 
the vote: Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Paul Broun of Georgia, 
Stephen Fincher of Tennessee and Walter Jones of North Carolina.

Rep. Michele Bachmann called 'stopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals' the issue Americans care about most

The 
only Democrat to support the bill was moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar of 
Texas.

The GOP plans met with howls of protest
 from immigration advocates and Democrats, who warned Republicans that 
they'd be alienating Latino voters for years to come.

'If
 you tell people that you think they're criminals, that you think 
they're simply bringing diseases, that they're bringing drugs, then you 
treat them as invaders, they kind of think you don't like them,' said 
Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. 'They're going to believe you don't like 
them, and they're not going to vote for you.'

The
 new GOP border bill adds $35 million more for the National Guard, which
 would go to reimburse states for guard deployments.

Like earlier 
versions, it would increase spending for overwhelmed border agencies, 
add more immigration judges and detention spaces, and alter a 2008 
anti-trafficking law to permit Central American kids to be sent back 
home without deportation hearings.

That process is currently permitted 
only for unaccompanied minors arriving from Mexico and Canada.

The
 bill would pay for strapped border agencies only for the final two 
months of this budget year, falling far short of the $3.7 billion Obama 
initially requested to deal with the crisis into next year.

More than 
57,000 unaccompanied youths have arrived since October, mostly from El 
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, plus tens of thousands more migrants 
traveling as families.
