Zaad Al-Hilli has been questioned by police over the death of his brother, Saad, who was shot dead in he French Alps.

The brother of a British engineer murdered in the Alps alongside two members of his family has been questioned by French police for the first time, it emerged today.

Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, was interrogated by detectives on Friday close to his home in Chessington, Surrey.

They spoke to him about numerous aspects of the quadruple murder which happened in a beauty spot close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

It comes almost seven months to the day since Zaid's 50-year-old brother, Saad Al-Hilli, died alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and and Mrs Al-Hilli's mother, Suhalia, 74, in the family BMW.

Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist also died in the September 5th bloodbath, which is believed to have been carried out by at least one gunman brandishing a pistol.

French prosecutors consider Zaid a key figure in the case because of an alleged bitter dispute with his brother over a family inheritance.

He has, in turn, continually insisted that he is completely innocent of any wrong-doing, and said he had a good relationship with his brother.

Their father, Kadhim Al-Hilli, died in Spain two years ago, leaving a number of properties and cash including the equivalent of some £800,000 in a bank account in Geneva, which is less than an hour's drive from the murder scene.

Saad put a legal block on his father's will, effectively preventing Zaid from inheriting his share until 'unknown' disputes had been resolved, according to published legal documents.

The French wanted to question Zaid over claims that he tried to use an expired credit card to withdrew cash from the Geneva account shortly before the killings.

Saad kept a Taser stun gun protection weapon at his home in Claygate, Surrey, and had also changed the locks of the £1million property to prevent Zaid getting in.

Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor who is leading the investigation, has continually claimed that the key to solving the murder mystery 'lies abroad'.

He has made no secret of his frustration at not being able to interview Zaid at length, but that situation changed when officers working directly for him arrived in the UK last week.

According to a French police source, Zaid was asked to explain at length his 'whereabouts on the day of the tragedy.'

He also offered information about the will, and about Saad's work as satellite technology engineer.

Surrey police, who have to date released next to no information about the enquiry, confirmed that Zaid had been contacted.

But they refused to provide any details about last week's questioning of Zaid, which was today being widely reported in the French media.

'We have regular contact with him as the next of kin of one of the victims,' said a Surrey Police spokesman. 'There is nothing more than that. He has never been arrested or considered a suspect'.

Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered head injuries after being pistol whipped in the attack and was also shot in the shoulder.

Her sister, Zeena, escaped unscathed after hiding under her mother's skirt in the back of the family BMW.

Both girls are now in the hands of social services, with surviving members of the Al-Hilli family, including Zaid, only allowed limited access to them.

There have been no arrests since the murders happened, with Mr Maillaud admitting that the baffling case 'may never be solved'.

He recently ordered investigators to visit Iraq, which is where the Al-Hillis originally came from, but this has been delayed because of security worries.
