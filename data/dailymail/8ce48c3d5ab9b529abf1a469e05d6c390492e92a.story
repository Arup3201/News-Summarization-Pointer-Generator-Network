Damning Evidence: Carlos Ortiz appears for a hearing at Attleboro, Mass., District Court, Tuesday, July 9, 2013. Ortiz told police that Hernandez allegedly admitted to firing the shots that killed fellow football player Odin Lloyd in June

Dramatic court documents released on Tuesday allegedly state that former New England tight end Aaron Hernandez confessed to Odin Lloyd's murder.

Filed in Florida and obtained by the Associated Press, the documents also reveal the chilling last moments of the semi-pro footballer on the morning of Lloyd's June 17th shooting.

According to the 156 page unsealed documents, Carlos Ortiz, 27, informed police that Ernest Wallace, 41, told him that the former Patriots player admitted firing the shots that killed Lloyd.

Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz and Lloyd are all believed to have been traveling in the same vehicle.

Furthermore, Ortiz told police exactly what happened on that June morning.

He said that along with Wallace and Hernandez they picked up Lloyd at his Boston home and were headed towards Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Ortiz claims that Hernandez had become upset that Lloyd had been 'chilling' with individuals that Hernandez did not approve of - but the two men apparently shook hands and agreed to let the argument go.

However, Ortiz told police that the car then stopped and Wallace, Hernandez and Lloyd got out to urinate upon which Ortiz said he heard gunshots and only Hernandez and Lloyd got back into the car.

case involving former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez

The documents were filed on Tuesday in Florida to justify searching Wallace's home after he was arraigned on charges of being an accessory after the fact in Attleboro District Court on Monday.

They also reveal that police 
found a spent shell casing in a Chevrolet Suburban rented by Hernandez that had been fired from 
the same pistol as five empty shells found near the victim's body.

When asked about the vehicle, Hernandez told police that he had rented it for 'O', who he identified as Lloyd.

Lloyd's body was found with the keys to the rented car in his pocket.

The documents filed on 
Tuesday in Miramar, state that while investigating Lloyd's killing, 
police conducted searches in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, 
Connecticut and found the Chevy which is wanted in connection with a July 2012 double
homicide in Boston.

Police have said they still do not have a motive for the murder of Lloyd.

The Boston Globe reported last month that Lloyd was believed to have known about Hernandez's alleged involvement in the 2012 double murder of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado and Hernandez reportedly killed Lloyd to keep him quiet.

Hernandez, who was released by the Patriots last month, is being held without bail and has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Lloyd, 27 and five weapons charges.

Carlos Ortiz, 27 has been charged with the illegal possession of a firearm and Ernest Wallace, 41, is up on charges of being accessory after the fact.

Odin Lloyd, 27, who played semi-pro football 
for the Boston Bandits, was shot dead in the early morning of June 17th -
his body was found by a jogger at 5.30 p.m. that day.

The court documents included an autopsy showing that Lloyd had been shot several times and that two projectiles consistent with .45 caliber ammunition were recovered from his body.

At an apartment rented by Hernandez in Franklin, Massachusetts - half a mile from his North Attleboro home -Â  police discovered five boxes of .45 caliber cartridges, according to the documents.

During an earlier search of Hernandez's home, investigators found an Hungarian rifle with an attached magazine in a black gym bag on the back seat of a Toyota sedan parked in the garage.

They confiscated video footage from the residence that showed two men in the driveway changing their clothes by the car, a silver 2012 Nissan Altima, apparently rented by Hernandez on the night of the murder. Other footage showed three men entering the house.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's killing. His legal team did not return email messages Tuesday.

In total, 156 pages of documentation released, police outline the cold and callous nature of Hernandez when they arrived at the football players home at 10.30 p.m. on June 17th to inform him about the death of Lloyd and ask him about the car he rented for the man he called 'O'.

Police said that Hernandez immediately became agitated by questions about his whereabouts the night before, asking 'What's with all the questions?'

The documents show that when asked when last he saw Lloyd, Hernandez replied that the deceased had been 'up his way', the night before.

However, police say that Hernandez displayed signs of nervousness and told officers that they would need to speak to his attorney, closed his door and locked it.

Minutes later he re-emerged with his attorney's business card, handed it over to police and again close and locked the door.

Intriguingly, when told by the police 'this is a death investigation', Hernandez apparently failed to inquire who had died.

'Mr. Hernandez's demeanor did not indicate any concern for the death of any person,' the documents state.

It was only after he contacted his lawyer that Hernandez agreed to speak to police and traveled to North Attleboro police station in Massacusetts to be interviewed.

The warrants reveal the breadth of the investigation, with authorities scouring through everything from Hernandez's house to his phone to the contents of his team locker, which the Patriots emptied into a container after they released him.

Prosecutors
said Hernandez shot Lloyd execution-style after becoming upset with him
days earlier at a Boston nightclub. Lloyd's body was found June 17 in 
an industrial area near Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, about 
40 miles south of Boston.

Two other
men have been taken into custody in connection with the case. Ernest 
Wallace, who is suspected of being an 'accessory after the fact,' turned
himself in to police in Miramar, Florida, last month.

Another man, 
Carlos Ortiz, was arrested in Connecticut on charges of being a fugitive
from justice.

Before being fired 
on the day he was arrested and charged, Hernandez had been a rising star
in the National Football League, a tight end with a $41 million 
contract with one of the league's top franchises.

Investigation: Police entered the home of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez in North Attleborough on June 22nd

The documents also reveal that during a search of Hernandez's Attleboro home a safe containing .22 caliber ammunition and a scale and a dish - drug paraphernalia - was recovered.

In addition, three Apple iPads, an iPhone and a cellphone containing LLoyds number under 'Dis N***A' and 'N***a Dis'.

They also reveal that Hernandez's girlfriend, Shayanna Jenkins may have let police known that Odin Lloyd was a marijuana smoker and dealer.

Indeed, in the damning court documents, a staff member at Boston nightsport Rumor Nightclub gave an affidavit in which he said Hernandex carried 'what appeared to be a handgun in his waistband'.
