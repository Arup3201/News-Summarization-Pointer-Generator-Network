Nick Clegg’s free school meals plan was in disarray last night after it was savaged by headteachers.

They blasted ‘ludicrous’ official advice that infants could be asked to choose their meals two hours ahead, eat at 11am and have cold lunches.

The guidance from the Department for Education even says parents might be brought in to chop vegetables.

Nick Clegg' free school meals plan was in disarray after it was  savaged by headteachers

From September, all children between four and seven will qualify for free lunches under the £1billion scheme announced by the Deputy Prime Minister at the Lib Dem autumn conference.

Heads have already warned they do not have the facilities to cope.

The guidance responds with positive case studies and the suggestion that schools make ‘lunchtime part of the curriculum’ and lengthen or stagger lunch breaks.

But Gail Larkin, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This policy was a nice soundbite and took us all by surprise – it just wasn’t thought through properly.

'One school that has been trialling this has had to start lunches at 11am and finish at 2pm – it’s ridiculous.’

Jim Holditch, head of Godinton Primary in Ashford, Kent, insisted the tips were worthless.

‘They are not addressing the problem that we have, which is lack of capacity,’ he said.

‘It’s being done so badly the Government could end up with a monumental own goal. The motivation is less about children’s welfare and more about election promises.

‘How much of break time would be taken up getting children to pick what they want for lunch? That frankly is a ludicrous solution.

‘Has anyone from the DfE ever tried to get 60 four-year-olds to choose at break time what they want for lunch and to remember by the time they get up to the serving hatch – or not to change their mind when they see the food laid out in front of them?’

He also questioned advice suggesting that menus be simplified: ‘The recipes aren’t complicated. We’re not having chateaubriand. It’s spaghetti bolognaise etc etc. I’m not sure there’s much mileage in that.’

Mr Holditch has asked his local authority for a share of £150million made available by the Coalition to help schools improve kitchens and dining halls.

But his likely allocation will be nowhere near enough to cover the renovations to kitchen and dining facilities he needs.

He said the guidance showed the initiative could not be delivered without detrimental effects on other aspects of school life, such as PE.

The guidance ‘toolkit’ suggests that schools ‘set aside extra time to help children learn how to use cutlery as part of their curriculum’.

It highlights a school where pupils are taught about the food they are eating, encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables and shown how to use knives and forks.

Further case studies include a primary that relies on parent volunteers to ‘prepare vegetables and bake cakes for its in-house lunch service’.

The toolkit notes that putting up ‘brightly coloured posters’ will improve the dining hall environment. It also tells heads to control noise levels by playing music, rewarding quiet pupils or supervising children more closely.

Mr Clegg’s initial hope that all 1.5million meals would be hot has been abandoned, with the DfE confirming schools will able to provide cold lunches as long as they meet nutritional standards.

For schools with too many children to feed in an hour, the advice is to ‘lengthen or stagger lunch breaks’.

The toolkit, written with an introduction by Lib Dem schools minister David Laws, notes that schools which took part in a free meals trial scheme found they ‘could get it right after a few weeks’ by being flexible about how they organised their lunch hours.

At St Lawrence Primary in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, there is no kitchen and all pupils eat packed lunches in their classrooms.

Head Paul Dyer said: ‘The status quo here works extremely well. I can see a situation where millions of pounds will have gone into this but that money will be squandered.’

Graham Stuart, Tory chairman of the Commons education select committee, said the free meals policy should have been thought through more carefully.

‘It does show the dangers of Nick Clegg pitching into education policy without being aware of the realities in schools,’ he added.

He urged the Government to step back from the September deadline.

But a spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘Pilots of universal free school meals run by the Department for Education and Department of Health started in 2009 and ran for two years.

‘Evaluation showed clear benefits for all in terms of educational attainment and healthy eating, but in particular for the poorest children. The plans are fully tested, well designed and properly funded.

‘Every child deserves the best possible start in life, and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets.’

A spokesman for the DfE said: ‘We are providing more than £1billion to ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day.

'We’re also making sure that schools are not left out of pocket by putting £150million on the table.’
