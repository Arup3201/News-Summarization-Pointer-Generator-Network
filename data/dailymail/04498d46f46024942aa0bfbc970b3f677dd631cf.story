David Beckham reunited with his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson to watch Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in the French capital today.

Beckham, who ascended the stands alongside former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, took up pride of place at the Parc des Princes to watch his former club. 

The 39-year-old ended his playing career with PSG in 2013, making ten appearances in the French team's Ligue 1 winning campaign.

Beckham also enjoyed successful spells with Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan following his all-conquering spell at Manchester United, where Sir Alex was his manager. 

The pair enjoyed a close relationship at the start of Beckham's career at the club, but this deteriorated in the early noughties, following his marriage to Victoria.

In 2000, Sir Alex allowed Beckham to miss a training to look after a sickly Brooklyn, then one, but after discovering that Victoria had attended a fashion event that evening, the then-ManU manager fined Beckham two weeks' wages and dropped him from a match.

Sir Alex argued that David should have attended the training and Victoria look after Brooklyn, and has since publicly blamed the marriage for changed Beckham's 'professional priorities'.

'He was never a problem until he got married,' Sir Alex said during a Q&A session in Glasgow in 2007.

THAT boot: Ferguson famously kicked a boot that hit Beckham over the eye, requiring stitches, during a dressing room row in 2003

'Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part. The big part is his persona.'

The culmination of their feud came in 2003 when Sir Alex kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, requiring him to have stitches.

According to Sir Alex, he kicked the boot at Beckham after the player swore at him in the Manchester United changing room following an FA Cup defeat against Arsenal.

However, it seems the two have let go of their old issues, as they were seen joking and laughing in the stands at  the Parc des Princes.

The former footballer had arrived by train from London after spending the past few days in New York to support his wife Victoria at her Fashion Week show on Sunday.

Beckham had departed from New York on Monday evening along with his children Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, but travelled to Paris alone today.

His three-year-old daughter has already become a darling of the fashion industry, being hailed as the world's best dressed child after the family's appearance on Victoria's front row. 

Mrs Beckham herself  had every reason to celebrate after sending a polished and sophisticated collection down the runway, which she described as 'sexy, liberating and full of bounce'.

In the hours that followed her show, a steady stream of positive reviews began flowing in, with Women's Wear Daily lauding the star for putting 'an abstract, artful spin on her minimalist polish'.

Speaking to The Independent today, Mrs Beckham said: 'I have a different way of expressing myself because I haven't had that formal training.

She added: 'I've learnt a lot, in the last seven years. I've learnt a lot very, very quickly. And I continue to learn.'
