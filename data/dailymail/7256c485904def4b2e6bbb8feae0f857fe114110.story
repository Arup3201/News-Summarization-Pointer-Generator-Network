Inter Milan are ready to step up their pursuit of Lucas Leiva and leave Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers with a big decision.

Roberto Mancini is a firm admirer of the Brazil midfielder and has made clear his ambition to take the 28-year-old to the San Siro during this transfer window to help Inter’s pursuit of a Champions League place. The Italian club are expected to make a bid in the next 24 hours.

Had Inter shown their interest in the summer, Rodgers would not have stood in his way but the situation is not straightforward now as Lucas, who has two-and-a-half years left on his Anfield contract, has been a key figure in helping stabilise Liverpool’s results.

Lucas has started 11 of the last 12 matches and the only game he missed was at Manchester United, when they lost 3-0. That defeat is the only reverse Liverpool have suffered since Rodgers decided to make his team more difficult to beat after they lost 3-1 at Crystal Palace on November 23.

Another Liverpool midfielder could also head to the San Siro this month but it is AC Milan who want to sign Suso. They are prepared to offer £1million to secure the Spaniard’s early release, rather than waiting until the end of the season to get him on a Bosman.

Raheem Sterling, meanwhile, should finally put pen to paper on his new contract next week. The England winger has been given some time off by Rodgers to freshen up and has spent his break in Jamaica.

Rodgers takes his side to Sunderland on Saturday and hopes the return to Wearside will spark an upturn in Simon Mignolet’s form. Doubts persist over the Belgian’s suitability to Liverpool.

‘He is a wonderful shot-stopper and makes saves,’ said Rodgers, who bought the keeper from the Black Cats for £9m in 2013. ‘He is doing everything he can to be the best he can be.’
