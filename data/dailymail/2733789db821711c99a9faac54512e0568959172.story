Steve Smith collected his first ever Allan Border Medal at the prestigious awards ceremony and was also named the Test Player and One Day International Player of the Year to cap off a sensational season. 

The 25-year-old received an impressive 243 votes to win the Allan Border Medal, ahead of his David Warner (175) and reigning medal winner Mitchell Johnson (126). 

Smith has enjoyed a sensational year, kick-started with a century against South Africa at the Centurion last February and culminating in a record-breaking Test summer against India.

The Batsman was in sensational form last season and had a record-breaking Test summer against India

He scored hundreds in all four Tests and set a new runs record for a four-Test series, piling on 769 runs at an average of more than 128.

He also captained the side for the final three games, elevated in Michael Clarke's injury absence, marking him out as the Baggy Green's heir apparent.

In one-day cricket he has scored three hundreds and three half-centuries in the past four months, again marking a first taste of captaincy with a ton against England last week.

The only senior award Smith did not take home was Twenty20 Player of the Year, which went to big-hitting Glenn Maxwell.

The all-rounder was Australia's top performer in a disappointing ICC T20 campaign in Bangladesh last March, topping the run-scorers list and becoming their most potent threat.

Sean Abbott picked up the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year award to end what has been a turbulent year for the bowler.

The 22-year-old bowled the ball which fatally struck Phillip Hughes in November but returned from the tragedy just 14 days later, taking six for 14 on his return to first-class cricket.

Meg Lanning claimed her second Belinda Clark medal following her remarkable last 12 months.

The 22-year-old had a terrific record over the season, tallying an impressive 490 runs at an average of 49.90 in one-day international cricket and scoring 625 runs at an average of 52.08.

The star-studded ceremony took place at the Crown Casino in Melbourne, and despite the wet weather, all of Australia's biggest cricket stars turned out for their biggest night of the calendar year.
