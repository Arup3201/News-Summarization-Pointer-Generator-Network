A suspected rogue trader said he was ‘sorry beyond words’ for his actions yesterday as he appeared in court accused of the City’s biggest fraud.

Kweku Adoboli, 31, faces claims that he lost £1.5billion in a series of complex trades while working at Swiss banking giant UBS.

Appearing before City of London magistrates, he crossed his arms and bowed towards friends then listened intently as his barrister apologised on his behalf.

Sorry: Kweku Adoboli leaves City of London Magistrates court yesterday after saying he was 'sorry beyond words' for the record £1.5billion losses suffered by Swiss banking giant UBS

No smiles: Adoboli sat in the dock as his barrister told the 
court in London: 'He went to UBS and told them what he had done and he stands now 
appalled at the scale of the consequences of his disastrous 
miscalculations.'

Handcuffed: City trader Adoboli is lead from the court into a custody van. He now faces a second fraud charge

Patrick Gibbs QC, said: ‘He, as the court will understand, is sorry beyond words for what has happened here.

‘He went to UBS and told them what he had done and stands now appalled at the scale of consequence of his disastrous miscalculations.’ 

Dressed in a dark grey suit, the former public schoolboy  looked stern as he arrived in a custody van this morning greeted by hordes of waiting photographers.

It was a far cry from the smile he wore as he left the same court in a bright blue jumper last week.

Prosecutors confirmed he is suspected of losing a further £200million after the true scale of losses were uncovered over the weekend.

A new charge of fraud accusing him of abusing his position as a senior trader as long ago as 2008 was added to the three counts he already faces.

No bail application: Dozens of photographers gather to catch a glimpse of Adoboli entering court. His lawyer, Louise Hodges, has made no application so far for bail for her client

Adoboli is accused of false 
accounting and fraud by abusing his position while working at UBS’s 
global synthetic equities division, buying and selling exchange traded 
funds.

Ghana-born Adoboli, who lived in an £800-a-week flat in London, nodded at supporters before being returned to Wandsworth jail.

Magistrates remanded Adoboli in custody until October 20 at the first of two committal hearings.

Adoboli's
lawyer, Louise Hodges, of solicitors Kingsley Napley, has made no 
application so far for bail for her client, from east London.

The alleged fraud offence took place between January 1 and September 14 this year.

Adoboli, son of a former Ghanaian official to the United Nations, joined the Swiss firm in a junior capacity in 2002.

Smiling: City of London Magistrates are set to consider Adoboli's custody conditions at the first of two committal hearings. He is pictured smiling leaving court last week

The
fraud charge against him reads: 'While occupying a position, namely 
being a senior trader with Global Synthetic Equities, in which you were 
expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of
UBS Bank, you dishonestly abused that position intending thereby to 
make a gain for yourself, causing losses to UBS or to expose UBS to risk
of loss.'

The two accusations of false accounting - which date back to 2008 - claim that he 'falsified a record, namely an exchange traded fund transaction'.

After Adoboli's first appearance in court, UBS revised upwards the cost of the rogue trading to $2.3billion (£1.5 billion) after previously saying the incident had cost it in the range of $2billion (£1.3billion).

City watchdog the Financial Services Authority and its Swiss counterpart have launched an investigation into why UBS failed to spot allegedly fraudulent trading.
