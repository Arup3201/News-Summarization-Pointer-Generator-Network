A father who died in the UK’s first case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has been described as a 'hard working and family orientated' man, as it is revealed his relatives may have contracted the same deadly disease.

The 38-year-old garage-owner from Glasgow died in hospital on Saturday - two days after laboratory tests confirmed he had the virus, which he is believed to have contracted during a trip to his native Afghanistan to attend his brother's wedding.

The man, who hasn't been identified because his next of kin are still being informed, returned to the UK from Afghanistan on Tuesday, via a connecting flight from Dubai, and was rushed to hospital three hours later.

His friend Mohammed Asif said the victim came to Britain as an asylum seeker several years ago. He said he lived with his wife and young son, aged around five or six, in Glasgow, where he owned a garage in the east end.

'We are all quite shocked,' he said. 'He was a very nice guy, very family orientated. He was hard working - he worked very hard to provide for his family.

'He was an active member of the Afghan 
community here in Scotland. About three weeks ago he helped me paint my 
living room, and now every time I look at it I just think of him.'

Mr Asif said he spoke to his friend while he was in the hospital and he told him he was convinced the illness would take his life.

'I spoke to him on the phone... as we weren’t allowed in to see him, and he told me he thought he was going to die,' Mr Asif said. 'He was very dejected. It must be a terrible disease, there’s such a high mortality rate.'

There are now grave concerns about 
three of the man's family members in the village of Aibak, Afghanistan, 
where he visited, as they are displaying symptoms of the fever.

Mr
Asif, acting chairman of the Scottish Afghan Society, of which the man 
was a member, said: 'I spoke with friends over there... one of his 
brothers is having the same problems he did - vomiting, body aches and 
pains in his ear.

'Two women from the family also have 
some symptoms. We have tried to give them advice, telling them that 
anyone showing symptoms should stay away from the rest of the family.

He
added that the group had contacted a local politician and sent over 
British news reports to be translated, to let the community know how 
dangerous the disease is.

Mr
Asif said his friend stayed the night in a guesthouse in Kabul on his 
way back from the village, which is in the Samangan Province, around 150
miles north of the capital.

'There, they have burned the carpets, mattresses, cups and cutlery that he might have used,' he told Sky News.

The man was picked up from Glasgow Airport on Tuesday by a friend, and within three hours was admitted to hospital.

He was initially treated in isolation
at Gartnavel General Hospital’s Brownlee Centre, which specialises in 
infectious disease, before being  transferred by the RAF on a C-130 Hercules aircraft from Scotland to a high-security infectious disease unit at London’s Royal Free Hospital.

According to his friend, the man 
missed his original connecting flight from Dubai and stayed the night in
a hotel, within the airport.

Potentially deadly: The man suffered from CCHF, a disease transmitted by ticks (pictured) which is especially common in East and West Africa

'The
police there stopped him because they thought he might have taken drugs
but they soon realised that he was just very sick,' Mr Asif told the TV
station.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it 
had contacted four passengers who were sitting close to the man on the 
Emirates flight from Dubai to Glasgow and two will be monitored on a 
daily basis for the next two weeks in case they develop any related 
symptoms.

CCHF is a widespread tick-borne viral disease which is especially common in Eastern Europe and East and West Africa.

There have been cases in the 
Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.

However, this is the first confirmed case of CCHF in the UK.

The disease is fatal in up to 30 per cent of human cases.

The onset is said to be sudden, with initial symptoms including headache, high fever, vomiting and back, joint and stomach pain.

As the illness progresses, large 
areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at
injection sites can be seen.

CCHF is not airborne and can only be caught through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected patient.

The people at the greatest risk are animal herders, livestock workers, and those in slaughter houses in endemic areas.

Healthcare
workers in endemic areas are also exposed to the risk of infection 
through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids.

The other two passengers do not require follow-up surveillance the NHS added, and the risk to all other passengers on the flight and the general public is 'extremely low'.

'Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can be acquired from an infected 
patient only through direct contact with their blood or body fluids, 
therefore there is no risk to the general public,' the Royal Free London
NHS Foundation Trust said.

However, on Thursday, members of 30 Squadron at RAF Brize 
Norton were asked to assist 
the NHS with the transfer of the patient from Glasgow to London using a C-130 Hercules aircraft.

The
aircraft was used because of its specialist isolation unit on-board. It
was sent to Glasgow from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire complete with a
full RAF clinical care team. 

The
man was picked up at Glasgow Airport and then flown to the 
high-security infectious diseases unit at London's Royal Free Hospital, via RAF Northolt.

The hospital houses the national specialist centre for the management of patients with hazardous infections.

It is the first laboratory-confirmed case of CCHF in the UK, according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA).

The man was diagnosed when he returned to Glasgow on Tuesday. He was initially being treated in isolation at 
Gartnavel General Hospital's Brownlee Centre, which specialises in 
infectious disease.

Dr
Syed Ahmed, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Consultant in Public Health 
who is coordinating the investigations into this case, said: 'The risk 
of person to person transmission of Crimean Congo Viral Haemorrhagic 
Fever is extremely low as it can only be transmitted by direct contact 
with infected blood or body fluids.

'It is not a virus which is 
transmitted through the air. As such the risk to those who were in close
contact with him is minimal. We have already made contact with all the 
patient's close contacts and they are being followed-up appropriately.

Military assistance: The man was transferred by the RAF on a C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Brownlee Unit in Glasgow to the specialist high security unit at the Royal Free London on Thursday

Emergency: The aircraft was used because of its specialist isolation unit on-board. It was sent to Glasgow from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire complete with a full RAF clinical care team

'The decision to transfer the 
patient to the high security unit at the Royal Free was taken in line 
with the national protocol for the management of cases such as this.'

NHS Greater Glasgow 
and Clyde said while the risk to other passengers on the flight was 
extremely low, if any had any concerns they should contact NHS24 on 08000 858531 for advice, further information and reassurance.

'Given
the fact that this man went into the care of the NHS within three hours
of his flight arrival in Glasgow and travelled directly home via 
private transport from the airport, we are confident that his close contacts subsequently within the city were minimal,' the board said in a statement.

'We have also identified all NHS 
staff, airport and airline staff who have had contact with the patient 
and any necessary follow-up action will be taken.'

Outbreaks
of the illness are usually attributable to contact with blood or body 
fluids from infected animals or people, the health board said.

Initial signs include headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and red spots on the roof of the mouth are also common.

Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception.

As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.

Dr Syed Ahmed added: 'The risk of person-to-person transmission of Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever is extremely low as it can only be transmitted by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids.'

'It is not a virus which is transmitted through the air. As such the risk to those who were in close contact with him is minimal.

'Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever is a widespread tick-borne viral disease.

'It is not common in Western Europe but is endemic in parts of Eastern and Southern Europe, central Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

'It is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) in the family Bunyaviridae.

'As soon as laboratory sampling confirmed that the patient was suffering from this virus, all the appropriate agencies were informed.'

If passengers have any concerns they should contact NHS24 on 08000 85 85 31 for advice, further information and reassurance.
