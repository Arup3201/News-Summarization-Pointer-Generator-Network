Manchester City are expected to have financial restrictions imposed on their squad for next season’s Champions League after breaching UEFA’s spending rules.

The punishment for breaking the financial fair play rules — introduced so that clubs do not spend more than they earn  — would see City effectively given a  limit on the salary bill of their European squad. That could mean they might not be able to afford to put all their players in their European squad.

City are also expected to be ordered to make a cut in the number of players permitted in their squad, which is normally 25 strong, and to be handed large fines when UEFA’s club financial control board meet today and tomorrow.

Sanctions: Man City owner Sheikh Mansour (left) has ploughed millions in to the club. Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (second right) and chief executive Ferran Soriano (right) are involved in the day-to-day running

The sanctions packages are understood 
to be part of a settlement offer to the clubs, which they can accept, 
reject or try to negotiate ahead of  the meeting.

Clubs
 can lose up to £37million over the last two years under UEFA’s rules. 
City made losses of £97.9m in 2012 and £51.6m last year, but were able 
to write off some of that spent on facilities, youth development and a 
number of other items.

Limitations: Manuel Pellegrini may not be able to put all his players in his European squad due to the salary cap

Meanwhile,
 City defender Joleon Lescott has re-opened talks with Besiktas
 over a move to Turkey when his contract at the Etihad runs out at the 
end of the season.

Lescott,
 who almost joined the Turkish club in the January transfer window, is 
expected to agree a three-year deal in the summer.
