Fans have been standing in queues for days, anxious to get their hands on Apple's latest iPhone.

So what do one group of fans do the moment they get the iPhone in their hands? Why, tear it down into little pieces, of course!

However, this is standard practice for the iFixit team, who always deconstruct products to figure out the value and provenance of the components inside.

The insides of a phone can be quite revealing to tech fans.

You can see if corners have been shaved, or no expense spared on the components inside.

You can even divulge information 
about Apple's relationships with suppliers - for instance, arch-rival 
Samsung seems more absent than first expected.

Inside the iPhone: Despite the luxury exterior of Apple's new device, the insides are much more like a computer

This is what your £500 will get you: The iPhone was completely disassembled by the iFixit team - before they put it back together again

Apple is notorious for keeping its products sealed, not even allowing users to change the battery.

However, the teardown found that while users still need special screwdrivers to open the phone, it was far easier to repair than previous models.

iFixit said: 'This iPhone may be the most repairable iPhone we've seen in a while.'

At least some of the processors 
inside the iPhone 5 have not come from Samsung, instead coming from 
relatively-unknown company Elpida.

Perhaps this is because of the frosty
 relationships between the two companies - coming on the back of a 
billion-dollar lawsuit successfully won by Apple.

Or instead it may just be Apple sharing the demand for the phone by using a range of suppliers.

From the images, it also seems that 
Steve Jobs's mantra that a device should be as beautiful within as it is
 on the surface still holds true.

The iFixit team have awarded the iPhone a
 '7 out of 10' for repairability, as - despite Apple's insistence on 
phones being repaired in-shop - all the components are easily accessible
 and easy to re-assemble.

iFixit's iPhone was purchased in Australia - the first country to sell iPhone 5s - within the first hour of trading.

Getting an iPhone 5 is no easy task, as Apple prefers to keep their electronics sealed.

DIY experts need to buy special Apple screwdrivers to open the unit.

Once inside, users then need a special suction device to remove the screen.

The
 team then rushed home to tear the phone apart, with their own pair of 
Apple's propriety screw-drivers at hand as Apple does not like users 
opening phones themselves.

After unscrewing the back-cover, the team use a suction cap to lift the screen from the rear housing.

This is a step-up from previous models, which required more work to remove the screen.

The team say the move means the iPhone 5 is likely to be far easier to repair than previous handsets.

iFixit said: 'Compare this to the 
iPhone 4s, where it took 38 steps to isolate the display assembly, and 
this iPhone may be the most repairable iPhone we've seen in a while.'

Removing
 the screen unveils the newly designed battery which is of a longer 
design and, at 3.8V, contains a fraction more than the 3.7V found on the
 iPhone 4S.

As other components - from audio 
chips to power modules to radio antennas - we can see that the iPhone 
contains many chips from the same companies which supply the vast 
majority of smartphone makers.

Qualcomm,
 Texas Instruments and Broadcom all have components tucked inside, 
suggesting they will do well from Apple's latest release.

Apple is believed to have used three different manufacturers to make screens, so suppliers could vary from handset to handset.

It is believed the firm made the move to ensure delays from one supplier could not impact iPhone 5 delivery dates.

However, it was reported in recent week that one supplier, Sharp, had fallen behind of shipments.

However, Apple appeared to be able to meet demand.

The interior also reveal one of Apple's trademarks - a neat, tidy design.

When the firm was set up, co-founder Steve Wozniak was renowned for his ability to create clean designs using far fewer components than the competition.

The firm even used to sign the interior of the first machines to make engineers feel part of the product.

Now, sadly that has ended - but the tradition of clean, simple design has survived - even though most of this will always remain hidden to most fans.

What a sucker: Once the screws are removed from the iPhone, the iFixit team can lift the screen off

iFixit was founded in 2003 by Luke Soules and Kyle Wiens, after a night frustrating night pulling an old iBook laptop apart.

They realised that few tech products came with an instruction manual on how to dis-assemble a device and re-assemble it.

Companies
 do not like consumers 'tearing down' products which, as a starting 
point, will invalidate a warranty and - worst case - could lead to 
injury due to faulty electrical parts.

But
 tinkerers and tweakers always like to get hands-on with their kit, so 
Luke and Kyle began 'tearing down' new products, in a bid to build 
guides for those who want a 'how-to'.

Speaking of their iBook experience: 'We tinkered. We fiddled. We broke some tabs and lost a few screws. But we fixed it!

Tweaking out the errors: The iFixit team, seen here pulling out the camera components of the iPhone 5, help regular users make hardware fixes for themselves

Household repairs: The website has expanded to deal with a range of household items

'We attempted to fix some other 
laptops but had trouble finding parts. So we bought a broken computer on
 eBay and stole parts from it. Then we decided to start selling the 
parts ourselves, and iFixit was born.

'For
 the first time, it was easy for someone with no technical background or
 experience to take apart a Mac. Our step-by-step instructions were 
enabling people to repair Macs they wouldn't have been able to repair on
 their own.'

'We thought 
the instructions would be useful to our customers - and they were. But 
it turned out that they were useful to a lot of other people as well.

'From
 New York to Alaska, Tibet to the Faroe Islands, people have used our 
guides to fix their stuff. They saved money, they kept their Macs out of
 landfills, and they did it completely by themselves.'

Now, everytime a popular device comes
 out - in particular, the iPhone range - Luke and Kyle are on the spot, 
frequently within the first hour or two, and ready to tear a device to 
pieces to be the first to see inside the coveted and jealously-guarded 
machines.

So next time you 
hear something rattling in your phone, or the screen starts going wrong,
 then if you are confident with a screwdriver, consider visiting iFixit -
 but be warned: if you pour coffee all over your iPhone, you will need a
 miracle to bring it back to life.

Standard components: The display connector is held firmly to the logic board by a few simple Phillips screw

Bespoke and standard: Apple has their own 'A6 processor' on-board, while Qualcomm, who supply HTC among others, supply the phone antenna chip

'This contact connects the metal frame around the front-facing camera to 
the frame around the rear-facing camera. Maybe this frame is some kind 
of an antenna? Only time will tell.

There are all kinds of metal-to-metal contacts inside the iPhone 5. 
Spring contacts make for easy repairs, but mandate careful attention to 
cleaning all the parts before reassembly.

Finger oils can get in the way of these metal contacts and cause frustrating component failures.

Speaking of antennas, a 'spudger' easily pries one end of an antenna connector off of the logic board near the battery.

In
 the iPhone 4S, this antenna location was reserved for the cellular 
antenna. We won't know for sure what this antenna's purpose is until we 
uncover more.'

iFixit has published teardown guide for all of Apple's main competitors, from the latest Blackberry to Samsung's Galaxy S3.

The images below reveal the different approaches other manufacturers use.

The Samsung Galaxy S3, the iPhone 5's arch rival. It uses a plastic casing which users can take off themselves tho change the battery.

RIM's Blackberry 9650, showing the larger number of components and bigger motherboard.

iFixit has also taken apart previous iPhones, including the 4S, seen here laid bare. The design is similar to the iPhone 5.
