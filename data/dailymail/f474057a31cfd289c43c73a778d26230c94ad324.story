Bryan Stone, 76, has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for drug possession with intent to supply by a judge at Plymouth Crown Court

A drug-dealing grandfather with a criminal record spanning six decades is behind bars again at the age of 76.

Bryan Stone was caught in possession of £4,847 of cocaine, £2,126 of cannabis, £40 in cannabis resin and £484 worth of diazepam after police executed a drugs warrant at his home in May last year.

An officer involved in the case said that Stone was the oldest dealer he had charged in his 26 years of policing.

Stone, whose criminal record dates back to 1949, was stopped seconds after leaving his home with a green shoulder bag on May 25 last year.

Police found 25 grams of skunk cannabis, £290 in cash and a mobile phone in his pockets.

Plymouth Crown Court heard officers found digital scales, which later revealed traces of cannabis, cocaine and cutting agents benzocaine and caffeine, in the bag.

Police discovered 121.8g of cocaine, with a purity of three per cent, 198.3g of cannabis, 14.55g of cannabis resin and 484 diazepam tablets at his home.

Stone, from Cattedown, near Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with
intent to supply, possessing cannabis with intent to supply, possession
of cannabis resin and possession of diazepam.

Judge Paul Darlow described the drug dealing as 'an evil trade' and said it had given Stone 'a social identity', a salary, and a thrill at doing 'an unusual act for someone your age'.

He sentenced Stone to three years for dealing cocaine and 18 months, to run concurrently, for dealing cannabis.

Alex Allsop, prosecuting, said Stone had a history of dealing and had previously been jailed for seven years in 1986 and seven years in 1994 for drug offences.

Jo Martin, defending, said Stone remained the sole carer for two of his step-grandchildren and at one stage had cared for all four of his step-daughter's children.

She added it was 'quite sad' that the only way he was made to feel a part of society again was through dealing drugs, thanks to 'old associates with criminal tendencies'.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Ken Ord said: 'Stone was the oldest man I've ever charged in my 26 years as a police officer.

'Nothing surprises me any more.

'It doesn't matter what age you are, if you're involved in causing people misery by selling drugs and you get caught you face a custodial sentence.'

Despite his age, Stone is not Britain's oldest convicted drug dealer.

Last year, Francis Cook, then 83, was jailed for two-and-a-half years after he was caught growing nearly 200 cannabis plants.

Cook, from Fareham, Hampshire, had turned to dealing to supplement his pension.
