He has five GCSEs and qualifications in performing arts, but without looking at the lists he makes every day on his iPhone, Ricky Dean would have no idea that he needs to start his morning by brushing his teeth and making breakfast.

At birth, Ricky’s brain was starved of oxygen and he lost the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories – a condition that has limited his lifestyle in so many ways.

Now aged 19, he has only recently stopped being angry about it. ‘I am learning to live with it – and a sense  of humour helps,’ he says.

‘I can respond to questions, but I’d find it hard to start a conversation, which makes socialising difficult.’

Insight: Ricky Dean, 19, whose brain was starved of oxygen as a baby causing him to lose the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories, is one of three teenagers profiled in a new documentary about young people with amnesia

Ricky, from Taunton, is one of three teenagers profiled in a remarkable new television documentary, The Kids With No Memory, about young people who suffer amnesia.

Until they met at a special camp in Yorkshire, they had no idea there were others in the same situation. In fact, experts say there are thousands of sufferers in the UK.

Although some are born with the condition or develop it shortly after birth due to brain damage, many others are affected as a result of encephalitis – a swelling of the brain.

Ava Easton, chief executive of the Encephalitis Society, says 4,000 new cases are identified every year in the UK. ‘The causes include infection, and the immune system going rogue and attacking healthy tissue,’ she says.

‘It is the herpes simplex virus – chickenpox and cold sores – that is most likely to attack the hippocampus and temporal lobe, the parts of the brain responsible for memory.’

Symptoms of encephalitis include a flu-like illness, exacerbated by more specific warning signs such as seizures or an altered personality.

Ava continues: ‘Of those people who 
survive encephalitis – the mortality rate is 80 per cent without swift 
treatment – seven out of ten respond to the anti-viral drug Aciclovir, 
ideally if it  is given within 24 or 48 hours. However, those whose 
memory has been attacked are unlikely to recover in that respect, 
although what sufferers can develop is better ways of coping with their 
condition.’

For amnesia sufferers of all ages, the 
society has been running camps in a natural setting with the aim of 
building their confidence and self-esteem.

‘Participants will do anything from 
horse-riding and working with falcons to wall-climbing or canoeing, and 
family members come along with them,’ says Ava.

Mystery: Rosie Paley, 18, from the West Midlands, lost her memory at the age of 16 after a family holiday

‘We aim to run these camps annually, but it’s a question of how often we  can get the money – and we never claim that they can help recover memory. However, we do aim to help sufferers develop confidence and to realise they are not alone.’

Ricky’s father Gary, who works  for Avon and Somerset Police, says: ‘Ricky got so much out of the camp, not least from mentoring kids who are less able. It appealed to his nurturing side. He used to be so angry, disruptive and negative, so it’s remarkable how he has turned his life around with humour and a positive attitude.’

Although scans show the part of Ricky’s brain that controls memory is unlikely ever to improve, he earned a C grade in his maths GCSE. ‘Maths is all about repetition, so it wasn’t that difficult,’ says Ricky, who also passed exams in English language, English literature, science and IT. He currently attends an agricultural college for those with special needs.

Ava discovered the value of putting the teenagers together with horses, falcons and other creatures. ‘Connecting with nature and animals enables people to develop their confidence, enjoy a sense of responsibility and in many ways care for something instead of just being the person who is cared for,’ she says.

Horse-riding at the camp proved an astonishing breakthrough for Rosie Paley, who lost her memory aged 16 after a holiday. ‘No one really knows what happened to me, but I got encephalitis after falling into some dirty water. It’s possible it may have caused a virus, which was responsible for my loss of memory,’ she says.

Rosie, 18, of Brierley Hill, West Midlands, can only remember things that have happened in the past few days, so she had no idea that she used to enjoy horse-riding until she attended the camp. ‘It was so strange. It turns out that I immediately held the reins correctly,’ she says.

Her mother Helen, 36, adds: ‘Rosie used to love horse-riding and took lessons for six months, but after her illness she had no recollection of ever having been near a horse, almost to the point of it being a phobia.

‘But once she picked up the reins again and held them, it was if she had never had a problem with horses. She took to it immediately. It was absolutely brilliant to see her starting to return to her old self.’

Rosie’s attempts to stimulate her memory include building a wall of photos. ‘Some have struck a chord, such as one of my little brother Rhys, who’s now aged four,’ she says. ‘It was snowing in the picture, and I could remember pulling him up the drive on a sledge when he was two.’

Although she is focused on finishing a hairdressing diploma, she shares with Ricky a skill for computer work. ‘Although I didn’t get GCSEs before  I became ill, I have since got A* grades in IT,’ she says. ‘I love web design  and have thought about becoming a website designer.’

Rosie is now looking to the future with hope and optimism. ‘You’ve got to be positive, and I’ve learned that there are other people out there like me, so I’m not the only one,’ she says.

‘I can still write, spell and remember a few facts, and keep going with life  so long as I stay in a routine. It’s made all the difference to my life.’
