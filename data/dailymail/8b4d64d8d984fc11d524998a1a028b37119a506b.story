Snakes don’t rank very high on the list of items you want to find inside your handbag, but that’s exactly what happened to a Queensland grandmother on a picnic with her grandson.

Marilyn Condon was relaxing in Tygum Lagoon in Waterford - 30 kilometres south of Brisbane - last Sunday, when her nine-year-old grandson noticed a red bellied blacksnake taking shelter from the sun inside her bag.

The snake, native to eastern Australia, is considered highly dangerous, with a rating in the top 20 most venomous land snake bites in the world.

This red-bellied black snake surprised a grandmother having a picnic with her grandson at the weekend

Logan snake catcher Grant Browne received a call at about midday. He explained that he had to call the local council before driving to the park.

‘They said they had just seen a two foot snake heading into the bag. Since it wasn't somebodies residence I needed to get the go ahead from the local council. ’

‘It’s natural that they would want to escape into the bag-they might look scary but they’re very placid snake and prefer to avoid confrontation.’

The snake had crawled into the woman's handbag, before people tipped it out of the bag and chased it away

By the time a snake-catcher got to the park he had to locate it in the shrubbery beneath a tree

Mr Browne was in for an easy days work, but he arrived to find that some other bystanders had pushed the bag over and chased the snake away with some sticks, leaving him to relocate it.

They advised him that it had gone towards a local tree, and knowing that the slippery serpent was unable to climb, he knew it must be hiding in the grass.

Mr Browne said it was a unusual occurrence.

‘There were lot’s of people around-with how timid these snakes are, I find it very odd that they would be hanging around so close to the crowds.’ 

But in the end he managed to catch the creature and take it to an isolated forest area.
