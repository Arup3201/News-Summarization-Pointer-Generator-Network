Police have confirmed they are not 
looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths of the two women 
at the Premier Inn in Greenock last month.

Death certificates for both women, of Paisley, have been registered at Inverclyde registry office in Greenock. Miss McDonough's was registered by her father Thomas McDonough, of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, while Mrs McDonough's was signed by one of her sons.

The documents show Miss McDonough died in 
Glasgow's Royal Infirmary on May 13 and her mother had passed away in 
Inverclyde Hospital on May 10.

The sole cause of Mrs McDonough's death was 'incised wounds of the left arm' and her daughter's was a single wound of the left arm.

Both certificates were lodged on June 4
with the causes of death being identified by forensic pathologist Dr 
Julia Bell following post mortem examinations.

The documents make no mention of 
claims the women had overdosed on paracetamol. Nicola's occupation is 
given as a social work student and Mrs McDonough is listed as a foster carer.

Police at the Premier Inn where the two women were discovered with what officers called 'slashing injuries'

Detectives combed the hotel for evidence but say they are still treating the incident as 'unexplained'

The mother and daughter had apparently booked a single night stay at the Premier Inn not far from their home

The pair had been reported missing 17 hours before they were discovered with horror injuries at the hotel last month.

The alarm was raised when former Lib 
Dem council candidate Mrs McDonough, who also had three grown-up sons, had 
failed to pick up her foster son from nursery in Paisley.

Officers had asked friends and family about any turbulence in their lives that may be significant.

Mrs McDonough was found dead in a 
bedroom while her daughter was found with substantial injuries in a 
hallway. She died in hospital before police could question her over what
happened.

Police are said to be baffled by the 
severity of the arm injuries suffered by the mother and daughter. It was 
said that, had Mrs McDonough survived, she may have required amputation.

It remains unclear why the two women had decided to stay in a hotel 17 miles from their home in Paisley.

Detective Inspector David Wagstaff has
previously urged anyone with information, however insignificant, to get
in touch with police.
