When Tina Lessiter joined a gym, she was hoping to lose weight, get fit and put her divorce behind her.

What she hadn’t anticipated was falling in love with her female fitness instructor.

But Miss Lessiter, 38, is now planning a future with the woman who helped her shed four stone.

Recalling the first time she met Miss Mullinger, Ms Lessiter said: 'I really admired the way she carried herself. She stood out, and lit up the room. I thought if I tried really hard, I could one day look as good as she did'

She was introduced to personal trainer Gemma Mullinger, 26, last year when she joined a gym for the first time, and the pair soon became close friends.

Miss Lessiter said: ‘I thought of her as a great mate and it hadn’t crossed my mind to be with someone of the same sex.

‘We went on a night out together as friends and by the end of the evening we were a couple.’ 

Miss Mullinger said: ‘I’d never thought of being with another woman until I met Tina, and neither had she, so it took us by surprise.

‘We’re both amazed at how happy we are together.’ Miss Lessiter, a community care worker from Barnstaple, Devon, became overweight and unhappy following the breakdown of her seven-year marriage in 2006.

In the years that followed, her weight ballooned to nearly 18st as she fell into habits of eating junk food to make her feel better. 

Ms Lessiter began attending the gym six nights a week, and became goood friends with Miss Mullinger

Feeling unhealthy and unmotivated, she decided to seek out a personal trainer.

She said: ‘My brother-in-law Sam handed me a leaflet for a local ladies-only gym. I reasoned that I’d been sitting around doing nothing for too long, so I decided to take the plunge and give it a go.

BEFORE

Breakfast: Croissants 

Lunch: Cheese and ham sandwich made on thick white bread, chocolate bar

Dinner: Indian takeaway with naan and rice

Snacks: Savoury snacks such as pasties 

 

AFTER

Breakfast: Smoked haddock with poached eggs, fruit and vegetable juice 

Lunch: Leftover home-made pork and vegetable curry 

Dinner: Fresh seafood pasta

Snacks: Fruit, nuts and seeds 

‘I’ve always been big. I can’t remember a time when my weight didn’t fluctuate.

‘When I split from my husband in 2006, things rather spun out of control. I’d happily eat an extra-large bar of Galaxy chocolate all to myself. I found being in a room surrounded by so many fit people quite intimidating.

‘Luckily Gemma, who led the classes, was really welcoming. I really admired the way she carried herself. She stood out, and lit up the room. I thought that if I tried really hard, I could one day look as good as she did.’

In June 2013, Miss Lessiter weighed 17st 10lb and wore size 20 clothing.

She started going to the gym up to six nights a week, and found herself bonding ever closer with Miss Mullinger.

She added: ‘We both loved food, so Gemma was able to help me make the switch over from the unhealthy, fattening food I was eating to a diet plan, tailored just for me.’ Before beginning her weight-loss programme, Miss Lessiter typically ate croissants for breakfast, thick white bread with cheese and ham and a chocolate bar for lunch, and an Indian takeaway with naan bread and rice for her evening meal. She would snack on savoury snacks such as pasties during the day.

Today, she often eats smoked haddock with poached eggs and fruit and vegetable juice for breakfast, followed by leftover home-made pork and vegetable curry for lunch, with fresh seafood pasta for her evening meal. When she snacks she enjoys fruit, nuts and seeds.

Miss Lessiter now weighs 13st 10lb and wears size 14 dresses.

Miss Mullinger said: ‘I’m really proud of the journey that Tina has been on. I would love her whatever she looked like, but having been through a similar journey myself before I became a personal trainer, I know how tough it can be to make that turnaround.’ 

Miss Mullinger helped Ms Lessiter's weight fall by four stone from 17st 10lbs and a size 20 

She said since meeting Miss Mullinger, she no longer watches TV. 'We prefer to spend time away in our campervan, enjoying the countryside, walking and spending time with our family and friends'
