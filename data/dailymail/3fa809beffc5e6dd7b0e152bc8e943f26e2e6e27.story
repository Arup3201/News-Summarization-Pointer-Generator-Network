After a dramatic year filled with arrests, court appearances and suspensions, Hope Solo is doing her best to win back the respect of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team. 

The two-time Olympic gold-medalist goalie has started a new blog, and in her first post details how she has recommitted herself to soccer. 

In January, the 33-year-old was put on suspension after her husband, former football player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested for DUI while driving a Team USA van.

Seeking help: Hope Solo says she has been seeing a therapist to deal with her 'pain and anger' issues. The two-time Olympic gold-medalist is now back playing goalie for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team after a 30-day suspensions

During her 30 days off the team, Solo says she addressed her mental health with a therapist and Eastern medicine.

All of these personal issues were detailed in an email Solo sent to her teammates before their recent match in Portugal, which she details in the blog post. 

'I let them know what I had been doing in the time I’d been away. I told them that for the first time in my life, I’d been seeing a therapist and dealing with a lot of my issues, and finally addressing all the pain and anger that was inside of me. 

'Twice a week, I also worked with an Eastern medicine healer in Seattle who had incredible experience helping some of the greatest athletes perform at the highest levels. He really helped me see things in a different light. 

'I wanted them to know that I hadn’t just taken 30 days off. Ultimately, I wanted to be a better person and teammate, and that’s what I’d been focused on,' Solo wrote. 

Solo also apologized to her teammates for her behavior at summer camp, when she was distracted by a court case involving her family. 

Last June, Solo was arrested after her half-sister and nephew accused her of attacking them in a domestic spat. 

Year of troubles: Solo was also arrested last year after her half-sister and nephew accused her of attacking them in a domestic dispute. Those charges were later dropped. Solo pictured above in court for those proceedings in November

Solo was charged with assault, but those charges were later dropped. Solo has claimed she was the victim in the altercation, and was just trying to protect herself from her 6-foot-9 nephew. 

'I’d been trying to focus while I was on the field, but I’d been a mess emotionally and mentally, and spent most nights crying with my roommate away from the team,' Solo said of her time at camp. 

Solo finished out the blog post by expressing her optimism that Team USA will defend their title at this summer's World Cup. 

In addition to playing for Team USA, Solo also plays for the Seattle Reign soccer team.  

Bonding with her teammates: On her new blog, Solo talked about her return to the team and a recent match in Portugal where she and other teammates went pottery shopping (Solo pictured second right)
