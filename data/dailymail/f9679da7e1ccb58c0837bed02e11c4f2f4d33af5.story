Every dog has his day. And if there are some who are finding it difficult to look for a suitable match, life needn't be a bitch.

There's now a website that's dedicated to their need. With dog mating as its raison d'etre, Internet portal candyromeo.com is a platform for all those canine owners who want a partner for their pet.

Claiming to be the country's first matrimonial website for dogs, candyromeo. com offers an opportunity to prospective 'brides' and 'grooms' to meet each other before tying the knot.

the owner of the first of its kind
matrimonial website for pet dogs

The brain behind the website, Kareena Abbott, was inspired by her love for dogs to launch it. 'I was in college in England and wanted to do something for dogs,' Abbott said.

So, she got together with three friends to launch the website to help people find mates for their pets.

'We knew how difficult it is to mate pets as you can't just pick up a roadside animal for the purpose,' Abbott says. 'People today have become very conscious of the lineage of puppies their pets would have.'

The portal draws its name from Abbott's two pet dogs, Candy (a poodle) and Romeo (a pug which has three generations now, all living at their owner's house).

The proud owner of 10 dogs says that since she already had a kennel and was into dog breeding, handling the rush of visitors on the website wasn't a difficult task.

Canine Coupling: The website candyromeo.com

'Launching a matrimonial and dog mating website was the next logical step. But theme weddings are all that we charge for.'

The idea has picked up well. Popularised solely by word of mouth, the website assisted mating of 1,065 dogs from across the country in its very first year.

This year, candyromeo. com has already got 665 registrations.

For dogs in Delhi, Abbott holds breeding sessions and weddings at her farm in Sultanpur.

For other parts of the country she just connects the owners to each other 'who then take it forward from there'.

People living in America are also using the website. Pavni Bagga of California found a match for her Maltese named Skittles in Princess from New Jersey via candyromeo.com.

The Roman themed wedding took place on October 26, 2011, with three lavish functions - one in California and two each in India at Abbott's farmhouse.

'Skittles and Princess have relatives in India too, so it was easy for the families to travel down and celebrate,' says Bagga. 'They now have three puppies. One lives with us in California and two with Princess in New Jersey.'

Abbott has other themes to offer as well to dog owners getting their pets married off. Themes such as the Arabian Nights, New Yorker Nights and Caribbean Nights - the idea is to pamper the dogs.

From decorations to the dress code, from the wedding cake to the guest list, from snacks to the after party, everything is done with attention to the minutest details.

'For the Arabian Nights theme, we also organise hookahs for dogs,' says Abbott. 'We are about to launch the 'Exquisite Candy' theme, which comes with a booth offering manicure and pedicure for dogs, and the dress code is Gucci and Prada.'

Pet mating is a necessity to keep a dog physically and mentally healthy, but candyromeo. com has gone the extra mile to make a regular activity an occasion for fun.
