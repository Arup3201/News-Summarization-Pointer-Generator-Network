The Christmas display was up for just two days in the port town of Calais before migrants took it to Paris

A £6,000 aluminium tiger that was part of a Christmas display in the French port of Calais was stolen by thieves and discovered 150 miles away at a Roma gypsy camp in Paris.

Weighing 440lb and 8ft long, the tiger was among exotic animals in a display for children.

It was taken after only two days and workmen had to repair an illuminated panda after migrants began using it as a shelter.

Police believe the tiger was stolen by a gipsy gang in Paris who planned to sell it for scrap.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has called for her town to be declared a high security zone and blames Britain for attracting migrants across the Channel and causing the port to become a bottleneck.

Following repeated calls for action in December French Interior Minister Manuel Valls ordered a company of 60 riot police to be permanently based at the port.

He has called on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to visit Calais to ‘see for herself chaos at the French port’ caused by migrants desperate to sneak into Britain.

Valls visited Calais following a pitched battle between Asian and African migrants armed with iron bars and a fatal stabbing of an Eritrean.

Currently an estimated 500 migrants are squatting in houses or camping out in makeshift tents close to the ferry terminal.

Calais residents are increasingly concerned at their town becoming a lawless zone and a hostage to UK immigration policy described by an official as ‘grotesque and hypocritical’.

Vigilante groups and a security firm have begun patrolling the sea front following beach hut break-ins by migrants desperate for shelter from wind and rain.

Ten days ago a shower block for migrants provided by a catholic charity group was torched by vandals.
