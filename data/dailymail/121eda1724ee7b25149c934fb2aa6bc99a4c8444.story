Tablet computers and iPads have become something of a regular prop held by newsreaders and television presenters while they talk to camera.

But BBC News presenter Simon McCoy left viewers baffled when he introduced a feature about 'drunk tanks' by holding something slightly less technical.

The 51-year-old broadcaster had intended to pick up his trusted iPad when the cameras prepared to roll in the BBC studios - but instead grabbed a pack of photocopier paper.

Baffling: Viewers spotted that BBC News presenter Simon McCoy had picked up a pack of paper as a prop instead of an iPad by mistake

Error: The BBC later admitted that Mr McCoy had picked up the paper by mistake

Viewers saw McCoy holding the packet in a
full-length shot as he hosted the item live on the rollling BBC News 
channel without any explanation.

But the BBC later said he had picked it up by mistake.

Although he realised his error, McCoy didn't have time to swap his paper for the expensive gadget and instead 'went with it'.

A spokeswoman for BBC News explained: 'This morning as Simon McCoy was preparing to introduce this story, instead of picking up his tablet to hold as he went to air, he mistakenly picked up a ream of paper that was sitting next to it.

'In the rush of live news, he didn’t have an opportunity to swap the items, so simply went with it.'

In the past the presenter has been seen briefly resting his head on the desk when cameras cut to him.

The camera had cut away for the local news to be read, but when it returned Mr McCoy was seen with his head resting on his folded arms on the desk.

He suddenly sat bolt upright and looked sheepish as he tried to regain his composure beside co-presenter Martine Croxall.

Following a number of mocking messages from Twitter followers, McCoy eventually tweeted: 'I was not asleep!'

He added: 'It was a long desk head-banging that wasn't meant to be picked up in the BBC1 opt!!'

But his co-presenter weighed in and jokingly told her own followers: 'Intravenous caffeine now being administered to @simonmccoy.’

Mr McCoy's gaffe is far from the first to befall BBC News presenters.

In 2007, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Karen Bowerman interviewed who she thought was IT journalist Guy Kewney about the legal battle between the Beatles' Apple Corps and Apple Computer over the use of an apple symbol as the logo.

But her guest was in fact taxi driver Guy Goma.

Mr Goma gamely attempted to answer the interviewer's questions, but later described the incident as 'very stressful'.

In 2009, a segment on BBC Breakfast about an expletive-filled rant from actor Christian Bale on the set of the Terminator film which was caught on camera left producers red-faced.

Ooops: BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid accidentally flashed a glimpse of her underwear in a live broadcast on Monday morning

Viewers were left shocked however when an unedited version of the rant was broadcast.

The curse of live broadcasting hasn't just affected newsreaders in the past either, BBC weathermen have been known to fall foul of the odd gaffe.

In 2010, BBC News Channel viewers saw weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker brazenly sticking his middle finger up at breakfast show presenters Simon McCoy and Fiona Armstrong, who were off-camera.

Last year, Alex Deakin mistakenly swore in a live broadcast when instead of saying 'bucket loads of sunshine' he predicted 'bucket loads of c***'.

Just this week, presenter Susanna Reid accidentally treated eagle-eyed viewers to a flash of her underwear as she crossed her legs on the BBC Breakfast sofa.
