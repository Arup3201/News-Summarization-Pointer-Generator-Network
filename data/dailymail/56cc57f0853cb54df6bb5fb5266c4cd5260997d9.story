Dementia patients are being failed at the end of their lives as they are not deemed to have a terminal illness, charities warn.

Many are dying on an undignified hospital ward when they wanted to be at home with loved ones.

The final stages of the disease have become the ‘forgotten aspects of a silent epidemic’, according to a joint report by the Alzheimer’s Society and Marie Curie.

Undignified: Pensioners with dementia are being failed on NHS wards, charities warn (posed by model)

It says that unlike other illnesses, NHS staff do not sit down with families of dementia patients and draw up an end-of-life care plan.

Around 850,000 Britons are known to have dementia, and the number is expected to rise to 2million by 2050 as the population ages.

The Government has promised to make the illness a national priority over concerns that there are no effective treatments and diagnosis rates remain shockingly low.

But this report warns that despite efforts made to detect and treat the illness early on, too little attention is being paid to sufferers and their families at the end of their lives.

The report also states sufferers are admitted to hospital ‘inappropriately’ (posed by models)

Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Dementia is frequently overlooked as being a terminal illness and as a consequence, there are unacceptable failures to prepare and plan for end of life care.

‘Despite much attention on dementia in recent years, many people with dementia are not dying where they had hoped, others face meeting the end of their life in pain or without dignity.

‘A lot needs to happen to improve care.

‘Improving staff training and awareness is vital in order to help make people’s final days as good as they can be.

‘Mapping this journey is difficult but considerations for end of life care for people with dementia are essential to meet the needs and dignity of each individual and their loved ones.’ 

Many dementia patients are believed to experience intense bouts of pain in their joints and bones but – due to the nature of the illness – cannot express this to doctors or nurses.

The report also states that sufferers are frequently admitted to hospital ‘inappropriately’ as they near the end of their lives when they should be cared for at home.

Phil McCarvill, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Marie Curie, the cancer care charity, said: ‘End of life care for people with dementia remains a hidden aspect of health and social care in England so it is vital that we shine a light on the final stages of dementia to improve care and support for people and their families.

‘I know from the personal experience of caring for my father that people with dementia have very specific needs.

‘All too often, services do not respond to the needs of the individual.’

Last year David Cameron pledged to make dementia a national priority and said there would be a cure by 2025.

The Government has also promised that by next year doctors will have diagnosed two thirds of all patients with the illness – currently it is less than half.
