A 14-year-old boy in San Francisco has been arrested as the suspect in the fatal stabbing of a former classmate who went on to attend a private high school on a football scholarship and had dreams of playing in the Ivy League.

Because of his age, police have not named the teenager who killed 14-year-old Rashawn Williams on Tuesday outside a convenience store in the city's Mission District.

Witnesses say Rashawn, a freshman at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, was buying chocolate at Rubin's Market with one of his younger brothers when he was attacked on his way out of the store about 7pm, NBC Bay Area reported.

Two teenagers had been waiting for him outside. One of them, who relatives say had been threatening Rashawn over Facebook, stabbed the teen and fled.

'Everything happened fast,' store clerk Adbulwahab Alshami, 33, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Rashawn  was rushed to San Francisco General Hospital's trauma center, where he was pronounced dead shortly after.

He had just finished his first week of high school.

'Even after all my time in the police department, there are just some things that make no sense to me, and 
this is one of them,' said Chief Greg Suhr, of the San Francisco Police Department, the Chronicle reported.

'I don't know what was going on from 
this other kid's perspective where he felt like he needed to do this, 
but we have an ultimate tragedy for the victim's family and now this 
other kid's life is ruined, too.'

Rashawn had held perfect grades at Buena Vista Horace Mann School, where he met his attacker, and was invited to play football at Sacred Heart on a scholarship, KTVU reported.

His high school football coach, Ken Peralta, wrote on Facebook that he was a 'wonderful young man.'

'Seems that another young man had issues with him over social media issues and was threatening him,' Peralta wrote, according to the Chronicle. 'The two crossed paths and with his little brother in hand, Rashawn was knifed in the heart.'

Rashawn had a perfect score throughout middle school and was recruited to play football on a scholarship at the private Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory. His dream was to play football at an Ivy League university

Rashawn's family said he wanted to play defense for the school and had his eyes set on going to an Ivy League school. 

'He was such a humble kid — he was so good-hearted,' aunt Maria MacMurray told the Chronicle. 'His dream was to go to Harvard. This is a tragedy.'

MacMurray also told the paper that social media could have played a role in the stabbing.

'It's hard. I can't explain the pain when I found 
out he didn't make it through surgery,' added Rashawn's cousin, 15-year-old Jamar Williams, to the Chronicle. 'I was just crying thinking about 
all the great times we had together.'

Dozens of friends and family members on Wednesday gathered to light candles and pray at the spot where Rashawn was stabbed.

'I just miss him so much,' cousin Zaakel Jackson told Mission Local said. 'I miss his smile, I miss his 
jokes. He’s a very smart and lovable person — and it just all happened 
too fast.'
