A new survey has revealed the most costly regions around the country in which to hire a babysitter, with New York City at the top of totem pole, closely followed by Washington DC and Boston.

Urbansitter.com, a site which allows parents to source local babysitters, polled more than 7,000 families across nine large metro city areas and concluded that the national average wage for babysitting one child is $14.97 per hour.

New Yorkers fork out hourly wages of around $15.34 for one child, running up to $18.74 for three children, whereas in Denver, it's more in the region of $10.84 for one child and $14.24 for a trio.

Expensive night out: A study by Urbansitter has revealed that New York babysitters charge the most, an average of $15.34 an hour for one child, compared with Denver, where $10.84 an hour is more the norm

Lauren Jimeson, a social media director and mother-of-three, tells ABC News she pays up to $25 an hour for 'quality' sitters, who won't just stick her kids, all under the age of five, in front of the television.

The busy working mom was in for rather a surprise, however, during a recent family trip to Florida.

'We found a babysitter based on a friend’s recommendation. They only paid around $8 or $10. My husband and I looked at each other and said, "Oh my gosh," because we pay double that for our kids', she says.

The same study also found that 26 per cent of parents polled hire a babysitter once a week or more, and that nearly half are spending upwards of $1,000 a year on the privilege.

It might just be a factor in the trend that more women now choose to be stay-at-home moms than at any other time in the past two decades, according to a recent Pew Research report.

And mothers who do work are paying more than ever for childcare; both for daycare - a 70 per cent increase nationwide since 1985, inflation taken into account - and for irregular babysitting.

Again, costs for full-time daycare vary quite significantly according to where you live; New York unsurprisingly topping the list again at a cost of $12,355 annually, and Washington coming in cheapest at $9,240.

And all that doesn't take tipping into account, with over 70 per cent of parents in UrbanSitter's survey saying they tipped their babysitters.

'You can’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids'

It appears families aren't sticking with their sitters for very long either, with a high turnover rate reported, and less than six per cent of families saying they've kept the same sitter for more than five years.

Interestingly, for the platinum credit card wielding parents of New York, it seems many are actually uncomfortable when prices seem too low.

Lynn Perkins, founder of UrbanSitter, admits the service was initially free when it launched, which led New Yorkers to be suspicious.

'When we started charging [from $8.35 a month], our numbers actually went up in New York,' she told UpStart last year.

Ultimately, for Ms Jimeson, the mother willing to pay up to $25 an hour for good service, the prices are worth it.

'It’s pretty incredible just how high [the costs are] here,' she remarks. 'At the same time, you can’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids.'
