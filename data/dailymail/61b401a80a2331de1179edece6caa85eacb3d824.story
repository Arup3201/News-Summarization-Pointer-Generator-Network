The research shows that poor quality or inadequate sleep can effect many different aspects of skin cells

It is well known that sleep is essential for health, with lack of shuteye associated with everything from weight gain to cancer.

But now research has proven the long suspected link between insufficient sleep and accelerated signs of ageing.

The study, conducted by University Hospital Case Medical Centre in Ohio investigated  the impact of chronic lack of sleep has on skin function and appearance.

They found that poor quality sleepers lost 30 per cent more water 72 hours after a skin barrier disruption, such as exposure to UV light than those who regularly have good quality sleep.

Crucially for women concerned with the signs of ageing poor sleepers had twice the amount of intrinsic signs of ageing such as fine lines, reduced elasticity and uneven pigmentation, as well as recovering slower from sunburn.

They also reported less satisfaction with their skin's appearance and had a dulled skin sensory response.

Further breakthroughs for the importance of night time repair of skin comes from cutting edge research from scientists on the process of Catabolysis.

Dr Nadine Pernodet, ‎Executive Director of Skin Biology Research at Estee Lauder explains: 'Catabolysis is a natural purification process that helps skin cells eliminate internal debris that can cause cellular damage.'

It is getting older coupled with environmental stressors that generate this internal debris within cells, which can cause cellular damage and prevent cells from functioning effectively.

Sleep is essential to skin repair which keeps it looking youthful and even

Skin cells, like the entire human body, have a natural 24 hour rhythm, repairing themselves at night and protecting themselves in the day.

The research, commissioned by skincare brand Estée  Lauder, is the first to show that Catabolysis is at its peak at night in line with the circadian rhythm of our bodies and that as you age, the process becomes less efficient and desynchronised with the night.

Healthy skin cells maximise natural repair at night and thus suffering from chronic lack of sleep will negatively effect your skin.

Sleep expert Dr Guy Meadows from www.thesleepschool.org debunks some myths ...

How much sleep do you actually need need?

The average amount of sleep people need to wake up feeling refreshed and to cope during the day is 7-8 hours. Genetic variation means that their are long and short sleepers and so sleep needs can range from 4 to 10 hours. Genetics also determine the time that you sleep such as whether you are an owl or a lark. Women are three times more likely to suffer from poor sleep than men (75 to 25 per cent).

Can you train yourself to have less sleep?

Contrary to what many people believe you cannot train yourself to need less sleep.

People who believe they need more sleep than they actually do and spend to long in bed could be weakening their sleep quality. For these people, paradoxically decreasing the amount of hours spent in bed could help to improve depth and quality of sleep.

What are long-term effects of not enough sleep?

Research tells us that good sleep helps to protect your immune system and prevent you from getting coughs and colds. It helps you to eat healthily and lose weight by regulating the hormones that control appetite. It also regulates your daytime mood and so helps you to combat feelings of stress, anxiety and depression more effectively.

Good quality sleep is also the answer to youthful looking skin by lessening the formation of wrinkles and preventing acne. In the long term, good quality sleep has been shown to limit your risk of conditions such as heart failure, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.

The fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room

What are your top tips for the perfect sleep?

1. Let go of the props – sleep is a natural physiological process that can’t be controlled and trying to do so by engaging in unnatural rituals or becoming reliant on props (e.g. warm baths and milk etc) can lead to further sleep anxiety. Follow a normal wind down of turning of the TV, getting ready for the next day, brushing your teeth, washing your face, reading in bed if you want to and then turning out the light.

To achieve your best nights sleep you should limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime

2. Be mindful – Worrying about past poor quality sleep or imagining how bad things will be in the future if we don’t sleep only helps to increase night time arousal levels. Mindfulness grounds us in the present moment by noticing things objectively and without judgment and as a result can promote sleepiness.

Take a moment to notice the touch or your pillow on your face or the movement of your breath and if your mind wanders off, gently return it back to what you were observing in that moment.  3. Welcome thoughts and emotions – fearful thoughts such as 'If I don’t sleep, I wont be able to cope' or strong sensations such as anxiety or a racing heart, are a common aspect of insomnia.

However, it is often our unhelpful attempts to avoid them such as watching TV or drinking alcohol in the middle of the night that actually keep us awake and fuel them further. Learning to change your relationship with them by getting to know them and even welcoming them when they arrive, helps to reduce their power over you and lessen your struggle with sleep.4. Timing and drive – when we can’t sleep we try to catch up by going to bed earlier, lying in or napping for long periods during the day. Whilst this may help you to cope in the short term, it often leads to a weaker sleep wake cycle. Start to go to bed and get up at ‘roughly’ the same time most nights, as this will help to keep your body clock on time and promote the natural drive to sleep. If you fancy a nap, then limit it too less than 20 minutes.5. The Bedroom – if you are awake at night choose to stay in bed and conserve your energy by lying still and being calm and relaxed. Be mindful and welcome your thoughts and emotions. The key is learning how to be in bed with all of your fears, rather than spending all night struggling with them or getting out of bed to avoid them.6. Live your life – the fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room. Commit to making small actions everyday that take you closer to what is important to you in your life, whilst experiencing your insomnia. Doing so takes away the justification for struggling with sleep in the first place and paradoxically promotes sleep.  7. Lifestyle and environment – Live a healthy lifestyle that promotes sleep. For example, drink a moderate amount of caffeine and stop by 2pm. Limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime. Exercise regularly during the day or early evening and for the reasons of enjoyment and health promotion, rather than to get you to sleep. Sleep in a cool, quiet and dark room.

Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II claims to clean out dirt or dead skin cells from deep in your skin while you sleep

Estée Lauder have used this research into the importance of sleep in skin cell repair to develop an industry first anti-ageing product.

Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery
Complex II works to aid the process of Catabolysis at night, resulting in younger looking skin with long-term use.

The patented Catabolysis Technology contains algae and yeast extract to support the skins purifying process and Chronolux Technology which helps support the natural synchronization of the skins nighttime renewal process.

The serum is applied before bed and washed off in the morning.

Estée Lauder's iconic original Advanced Night Repair has been one of the best-selling anti-ageing products for the past 25 years and one of the first products to harness the fact that the skin repairs itself at night.

The Daily Mail's Beauty Editor Elsa McAlonan was one of the first industry experts to try the £48 serum ahead of it going on sale next week, she said: 'The product is supposed to slow down the look of premature ageing, dramatically reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improve the appearance of radiance and evenness.

'In tests, 83 per cent of women felt their skin looked healthier, and found it gave them a fresher, more rested look. Don't expect to look ten years younger after one night, but you should see a difference after a week.'
