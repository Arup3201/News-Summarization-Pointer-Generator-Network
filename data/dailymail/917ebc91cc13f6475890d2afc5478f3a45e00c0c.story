Bernardine Bishop could be the first author to win the Costa Book of the Year prize posthumously after she was named among the shortlisted writers yesterday.

The writer has been included in the best novel category for her book Unexpected Lessons In Love.

Bishop, who died in July this year, wrote two 
novels early in her career before working as a teacher and 
psychotherapist.

She returned to fiction after a cancer diagnosis forced
her retirement and two more of her novels will be published posthumously.

Bishop, who died aged 73, had a brush with literary controversy in 1960 when she was the youngest witness in the 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' trial.

She was called by the defence to show that she had not been corrupted by the book, which caused a storm in the world of literature.

Also on the list is writer and TV presenter Clive James who is in the running to win the £30,000 prize for his translation of Italian poet Dante.

The Australian star, who has struggled with ill health in the last few years, is best known for his hit show Clive James On Television and has had a long, successful career as a prominent literary critic and journalist.

He worked as a television columnist for The Observer and his own show, Clive James On Television, ran for years and his wry commentary on programmes, such as Japanese game show Endurance, made him a household name.

His book, a translation of epic poem The Divine Comedy, was described by Costa Book Awards judges as 'a towering achievement that will stand the test of time'.

The Costa awards, open to UK-based writers, are divided into five categories: first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's book.

The winners of each category pick up £5,000 with an overall winner getting £30,000 at a ceremony in central London on Tuesday January 28.

Other contenders include Kate Atkinson who won the overall prize in 1995. She is one of four names on the all-women shortlist for best novel.

Also shortlisted is Lucy Hughes-Hallett's biography of Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, which won this year's Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction.

Last year's overall Costa prize went to novelist Hilary Mantel for Bring Up The Bodies.
