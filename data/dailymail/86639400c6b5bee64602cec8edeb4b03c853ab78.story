Maria Malone-Guerbaa has transformed herself into an incredibly realistic reindeer using make-up

Super-talented Maria - who does her own make-up - has previously transformed herself into the likes of Freddie Mercury and Nelson Mandela.   

The 40-year-old mother-of-two from London didn't use any prosthetics or special effects for her reindeer look, only her brushes and kryolan paints to recreate antlers, bright eyes and nose.

Maria said: 'Everyone always does Santa Claus or elves and I just wanted to do something different.

'Reindeer are such beautiful creatures and I wanted to see if I could become one with the power of makeup illusion.'

The make-up artist documented her transformation from human to reindeer in a series of photographs

Maria usually makes herself up as celebrities but wanted to try something different for Christmas 

Maria said that her reindeer creation took several hours to complete, 'It took over two hours to build up the shading to create the illusion of depth and hair.

'The makeup effect has received awesome attention and I'm delighted to have inspired so many.'

Maria is a freelance make-up and hair artist for films and TV and her work has gone viral after she posted some of her pictures online.

Maria even painted her hair in the shape of antlers as part of the amazing transformation 

She's always had a passion for art but only started on her celebrity lookalikes when she started doing face painting for parties for her children - Sophia, 12, and Adam, 10.

Maria has previously revealed that she started working on her own face as her children would become bored during the process.

She said: 'I was practicing on the children at home but they used to get bored so that’s why I started painting my own face.'

Maria has previously used her skills to transform herself into celebrities such as the late Freddie Mercury

Maria continued: 'I would go up to the kitchen and start painting, it developed over the years, going from this level to the next and now people asking how did I learn to paint like this?

'The famous faces are my favourite because they’ve made me very popular they went viral on Facebook which was a shock. People were messaging me from around the world, it was mad.

'Then the make up world and face painting world started talking to me, and people in Miami called the World Face and Body Painting Association,' Maria said.

Maria doesn't just do famous faces her she has transformed herself into a scary clown

Maria says her famous faces take four hours to create and she uses a small eyeliner brush to create the looks

She admits her famous faces can take a while to create: 'They take me about four hours to do as they are very detailed, and I literally use the smallest brush - an eyeliner brush.'

Maria says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in Hollywood productions, she will wait a few years before applying for those roles as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up. 

'I don’t feel comfortable about leaving them for months -which is how long it would be if I was working on a film.

'I would also love to work in England or London, which is why I tried the West End shows. I thought I could do something while I’m still near home.' 

When transforming herself into the Queen Maria even painted on some jewelry and a brooch

One of Maria's most successful transformations was into the late Nelson Mandela
