A man has been arrested and charged in connection with a midday jewelry store robbery at Watch Standard Jewelry in New York City's Diamond District.

Rondu Frisby was charged early Tuesday with robbery and criminal possession of a controlled substance.

Police say the 37-year-old was an acquaintance of the jewelry store's owner, who has been identified by local media as Daniel Mikhaylov. It wasn't clear if Frisby had a lawyer.

Where is he? 58-year-old Leon Fenner, pictured, was still being sought in connection with the Veterans Day robbery in the Diamond District. Meanwhile, Rondu Frisby was charged Tuesday 

Alleged robbers: Police say one suspect entered the store, pulled out a gun and grabbed jewelry while another suspect waited in the hallway as lookout. They released surveillance video showing two men on the street

Sources told The New York Post that Frisby worked occasionally for the store, and that he had been questioned due to buzzing a man inside who committed the theft and earlier feigned he was a courier.

Police say one suspect entered the eighth-floor Watch Standard Jewelry store, pulled out a gun and grabbed jewelry while another suspect waited in the hallway as lookout.

Frisby was at the Watch Jewelry Store for five minutes before the theft, Mikhaylov revealed to The Post. 

'Rondu’s not my employee, I want to make that clear,' Mikhaylov told the newspaper. 'He is a person that comes by once in a while, like a friend. He started out as a customer who’d buy gifts for his girlfriend.'

Mikhaylov's father Boris - who is one of the store's co-owners - was pistol whipped during the brazen midtown Manhattan heist last Tuesday as the Veterans Day Parade marched nearby.

Investigation: Rondu Frisby was been arrested and charged in connection with the jewelry store robbery

Boris Mikhaylov was forced to empty the contents of a safe - and about a half million dollars in jewelry was taken.

Daniel Mikhaylov told The Post '[There was a] gun pointed at my sister’s face. My father got hit in the head. It’s family. 

'My dad’s still walking around with a big bump on his head.'

Last week a man who claimed to work in the same building where the robbery was committed, Tony Jabaly, told The Wall Street Journal 'When we came out [police] were treating the situation like there were hostages in the building. They were pointing their guns at us as we went down the stairs.'

58-year-old Leon Fenner was still being sought in connection with the robbery, and it is not known who the third man is.
