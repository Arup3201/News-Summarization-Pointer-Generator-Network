Two nine foot-tall polar bears raise their giant paws, bite and wrestle in the snow on a beautiful winter's day by Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, in brilliant new photographs by Joyce Ferder.

The image is a common one at this time of year says Ferder, who worked in TV news before becoming a full-time landscape and wildlife photographer. 

'There is nothing for the bears to do but wait for the ice (to form) so they play by sparring to be ready for when they will have to fight each other for the right to mate with a female next year,' Ferder says. 'Imagine Greco-Roman wrestling but with polar bears, it is exactly like that.

While play fighting, the young polar bears look ferocious when they rise onto their back legs

The powerful carnivores push each other on the shore of the bay while they wait for the ice to form over the water

'They would usually just be lying around and one would roll over and start pawing at the other.

'From there they would push and shove each other going fully on hind legs every so often. There would be a lot of biting and gnawing.'

This scene was an early birthday gift for Joyce, who turned 56 the day after witnessing this hour-long play fight.

'They would sometimes hold each others head in the snow for a few seconds as if on a count and then start it all over again,' Ferder recalls.

'I was in awe of the power of the animals and the amazingly clear day with the most extraordinary light. Up until that point we had had some terrible weather - blizzards and very grey days.

As if Greco-Roman wrestling like humans (aside from the biting) the bears take each other to the ground to show their strength

The bears spent an hour fighting, says the photographer, before walking off into the sun together

'It was also preternaturally quiet as the bears made no sound when they fought each other.

'The only sound you would hear was the sound of snow going "oomph" when the bears hit each other and the respectful murmurs of the human beings feeling privileged to watch such a spectacle.

'Not only is the light incredible, I love the small details in the photos - the texture of their fur, the blood shot eyes and their teeth.

'If you look closely you can see spit from the left bear's mouth in the air.'

When the powerful duo were done, Ferder says they walked off into the sun together.

Churchill in Manitoba is known as the polar bear capital of the world where a host of companies run tours which allow people to see them in the wild.
