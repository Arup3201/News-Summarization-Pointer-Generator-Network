South Africa head coach Heyneke Meyer has responded to last weekend's shock defeat by Ireland by making five changes to his starting XV to face England at Twickenham on Saturday.

There are two new faces at half-back with Cobus Reinach and Pat Lambie coming in for Francois Hougaard and Handre Polland, while JP Pietersen replaces Cornal Hendricks on the right wing.

Up front, Adriaan Strauss starts ahead of Bismarck Du Plessis and experienced flanker Schalk Burger starts ahead of Oupa Mohoje.

Le Roux, Pietersen, Serfontein, De Villiers, Habana, Lambie, Reinach, Mtawarira, Strauss, J Du Plessis, Etzebeth, Matfield, Coetzee, Burger, Vermeulen 

Replacements: B Du Plessis, Nyakane, Oosthuizen, Botha, Mohoje, Hougaard, Pollard, Hendricks 

All five players to have been removed from last weekend's starting XV will begin the clash at Twickenham on the bench. 

'We've accepted our performance against Ireland last weekend was not up to scratch and everyone in the touring squad has put up their hands and dug deep this week,' Meyer told SArugby.net. 'We've really worked hard at fixing the mistakes we made and the challenge is now to put that into action on Saturday. 

'Pat started at Twickenham for us two years ago and did very well. He's playing well at the moment and I wanted to give him the opportunity to start. Pat is tactically very astute and even though he's still pretty young, he's got a lot of experience.

'Adriaan, Schalk and JP have all started a number of Tests this year and they will slot in easily – we decided beforehand that we wanted to start all of these players in one of the first two Tests on tour.

'It's a big occasion for Cobus but he would not have been here if we didn't believe he could deliver the goods, and he'll be next to his provincial team-mate in Pat.

'As usual, we're also expecting our replacements to raise the intensity when they're sent on and Bismarck, who had a very good game in Dublin especially in the set-pieces, Oupa, Francois, Cornal and Handre will provide important cover off the bench.'
