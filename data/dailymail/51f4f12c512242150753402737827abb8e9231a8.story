The widow of former spy Alexander Litvinenko has described the final moments she spent with her husband after he died in hospital.

Marina Litvinenko revealed the harrowing moment doctors told her the former KGB agent had died from polonium poisoning.

She told an inquiry that she was then allowed to enter his hospital room without protective gloves and could kiss and touch her husband.

Warning: Alexander Litvinenko was told to prepare his will four years before he died of radiation poisoning

Mr Litvinenko's wife Marina leaves the Royal Courts of Justice today after giving evidence at an inquiry into her husband's death

She said: 'The doctor said Sasha had passed away. "Would you like to see Sasha?" he asked. I said, "Of course". 

'When we went into his room it was so different. We didn’t need protective gloves. I could touch him. I could kiss him. This time no one said it was dangerous; nobody told me not to do so.'

Her account came as shocking video was revealed showing Russian special forces using a photograph of Mr Litvinenko for target practice.

The footage shows agents tackling an assault course and firing their weapons at a shooting range before an image of Mr Litvinenko's face is shown, appearing to be the target and riddled with bullet holes.

The video, which was thought to have been filmed before his death, comes as it was revealed that Mr Litvinenko was warned he was at risk of assassination and told 'get your will ready' four years before he died from radiation poisoning.  

A video was shown at the inquiry today showing Russian Special Forces training during target practice 

The footage also appeared to show that an image of Mr Litvinenko's face was being used during target practice and appeared riddled with bullet holes 

A former colleague from the Russian secret service sent an email to the dissident telling him he had been 'sentenced to extrajudicial elimination' in October 2002, the hearing was told.

Giving evidence today, Mr Litvinenko's widow wept as she told the court her husband's last words were, 'I love you so much.'

Mrs Litvinenko kept a daily bedside vigil as her husband deteriorated from a 'healthy and good looking man' to a dying patient whose vital organs were failing fast.

During one visit she stroked his head only for clumps of hair to fall out in her hand and onto the pillow.

And on the day before he died Mrs Litvinenko, 52, told her husband that she had to leave because she needed to get home to care for their son Anatoly.

The former KGB agent then 'smiled so sadly' and whispered: 'I love you very much.'

Mrs Litvinenko was joined at the hearing by her son Anatoly, who also told the inquiry about the moment he was told his father had died 

At the hearing and giving evidence, Mrs Litvinenko wept as she recalled her husband's last words to her were 'I love you so much' 

In an attempt to keep her husband's spirits up, she joked: 'Oh finally. I've not heard this for a long time. I'm so happy. I'll see you tomorrow.'

Breaking down in tears, she told the public inquiry into her husband's death: 'It was his last words that I heard.'

Mr Litvinenko, 43, converted to Islam on his deathbed so that he could be buried in Chechen soil, the hearing was told.

He died at University College Hospital in November 2006, three weeks after he was poisoned by drinking tea laced with polonium during a meeting with two Russians.

Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been named as the two main suspects in Mr Litvinenko's death, but both have denied any involvement and refused to give evidence at the inquiry.

Today the hearing was shown a video clip of the Russian dissident publicly blaming Vladimir Putin for the murder of a prominent Russian journalist weeks before his own death.

Mr Litvinenko was seen addressing a meeting at the Frontline Club in which he claims Putin opponent Anna Politkovskaya had been murdered at the orders of the Russian president.

Standing up and holding a microphone, he speaks in Russian and a member of the panel he is addressing translates his comments into English.

'Mr Putin murdered her,' he says.

After being poisoned he signed a statement written for him by his friend and solicitor in which he blamed Mr Putin for his death, his widow told the inquiry.

Accusation: Mr Litvinenko accused Vladimir Putin of a string of serious crimes

Mrs Litvinenko said the day her husband fell ill - November 1, 2006 - the couple had celebrated the anniversary of their arrival in the UK with a home-cooked meal.

He fell ill that evening, vomiting frequently and experiencing diarrhoea and bleeding, the inquiry heard, but it was not until a few days later he was taken to Barnet hospital.

Mrs Litvinenko earlier described the moment her husband, who she affectionately knew as Sasha, started to lose his hair as she ran her fingers across his head.

They decided to remove his hair completely and were able to do so by hand it was falling out so easily, she told the inquiry.

Mrs Litvinenko said her husband was baptised into the Russian Orthodox church but following a conversation with exiled Chechen leader Akhmed Zakayev, he decided to convert to Islam in hospital.

She told the inquiry he wanted to be buried in Chechen soil, which prompted his decision. An imam was brought to the hospital for a ceremony that lasted a few minutes. 

Mrs Litvinenko denied the suggestion that her husband could have inadvertently poisoned himself while obtaining polonium.

'It's not possible from my point of view,' she said. 'Sasha was a very legal person. It's illegal and he will not do any illegal things in this country.'

Yesterday, she told the inquiry that her husband had accused Mr Putin of having links with criminal gangs during his time as mayor of St Petersburg.

Mr Litvinenko fled Russia in 2000 after turning on the Russian secret service when he was asked to kill tycoon Boris Berezovsky, who later became a close friend of his.

On arriving at Heathrow Airport with his wife and  Anatoly, he went up to a policeman and said: 'I'm a KGB officer and I'm asking for political asylum.'

During his time living in Britain he continued his opposition to Mr Putin's regime, and shortly before his death he accused the Russian president of being a paedophile.

The hearing continues.

The son of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko told the inquiry he never truly believed his father would die.

Anatoly Litvinenko, now aged 20, gave evidence into the public inquiry into his father's death saying he was proud to be a British citizen.

Dressed in a suit and a tie, Mr Litvinenko, who was 12 when his father was poisoned, recalled visiting the hospital on the day of his death.

He said: 'Before this point I never truly believed my father would die. I was young and optimistic and I thought he would recover.'

Anatoly Litvinenko, the son of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko at the Royal Courts of Justice today. He told an inquiry into his father's death that he never truly believed his father would die 

Mr Litvinenko was told his father had died on November 1 2006 at University College Hospital and was then taken into the room where his body was laid out.

He added: 'This hit me hard but at the same time I felt quite numb.

'It was very painful to look at him in the state he was in.'

Mr Litvinenko was not aware his father had worked for Russian intelligence services before coming to the UK, nor that he had been working for British security services.

He believed his father was a journalist writing for the Chechen press, the inquiry heard.

He added: 'I understood why he disliked Russia. I understood why he liked England and I understood his sentiments towards Chechnya.'

Asked by counsel to the inquiry Robin Tam QC about occasions when Mr Litvinenko spoke to him about Britain, Mr Litvinenko said: 'He was always going on about the integrity of this nation. The honesty. The transparency with which judicial processes are carried out.

'The honesty of the police and the deep contrast with the regime in which he grew up in and the system in which he served.'
