It was all going so well for Barcelona. Six games played and no goals conceded. The statistics laughed in the face of critics who said in the summer that once again they had failed to bring in the correct defensive reinforcements. Then they played a team with something approaching a world class forward line and the house of cards came tumbling down.

Lucas Moura, Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore is not the Europe's greatest forward line but it's a good few notches up on the Spanish league teams Barça have played so far and it was too much for a back four made-up of three full-backs (two of them who play like wingers, and one converted into a centre-back) and a holding midfielder, also converted into a centre back.

Those flying full-backs Dani Alves and Jordi Alba were at fault for the first two goals. Alves conceded the free-kick for the first and Alba lost possession ahead of the second. The Brazilian gave the ball away 15 times and Alba 8 times as Barcelona lost possession 82 times during the game.

Having not conceded in their opening six games of the season, Barcelona then shipped three in one game

'I have seen a lot of Barcelona games and teams always create chances by getting in behind their advanced full-backs,' said Laurent Blanc after the game. Barça always played with a high full-back under Pep Guardiola but he was usually balanced out by a more defensive player on the opposite flank. Guardiola's Barça, at its best, had Alves on the right and Eric Abidal on the left. Alves AND Alba has long been one risk too many, especially against good teams.

In the centre of defence it would be unfair to blame the Mascherano Mathieu axis – almost as unfair as when the French defender was confronted by an angry fan at the club's training ground last week over a bet the supporter had lost because Barça failed to beat Malaga; Mathieu didn't even play in the game.

In truth both have been solid and developed a good understanding. Both have the pace to play the high line that suits Barca's pressing game but it's also true that neither is the young dynamic defender the club's supporters have long requested be signed.

Barcelona play with an incredibly high defensive line which can leave them exposed on the flanks

Under Pep Guardiola, Dani Alves would attack while the left-back defended, but now both push forward

There was an attempt in the summer to sign Marquinhos but Barça were priced out of the move. Late on in Tuesday's game he made the last gasp save from Jordi Alba that made sure of all three points. His wild celebration – as if he had scored – was telling. 

He had shown on the night that he was worth the money Barcelona were unable or unwilling to pay for him.

Alongside him was David Luiz who had also been on Barcelona's radar and in the stands was a watching Thiago Silva who was the original 'missed target' as they have failed to sign a top defender despite the obvious need.

Neymar and Lionel Messi are on form for Barcelona but without an improved defence they will struggle

This was arguably the first time this season that Barcelona had faced an attacking line-up with real quality

One top defender who is at Barcelona is Gerard Pique but he has only started two games all season and is evidently not in Luis Enrique's first choice XI. On his own recent admission he is not the majestic all-conquering defender of old and is currently third choice. 

With Pique back to his best and either Mathieu or Thomas Vermaelen at left back to give the back four more balance we may yet see Barça sort themselves out defensively.

Settling on a keeper and bringing to an end the constant switching between Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and Claudio Bravo may also help. Until such time they will continue to be picked off by Europe's best attacking teams. They can't win the Champions League if when Messi and Neymar score at one end, chaos continues to reign at the other.
