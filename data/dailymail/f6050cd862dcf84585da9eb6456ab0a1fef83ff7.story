New pictures have been released by police who are growing increasingly concerned for the welfare of a missing schoolgirl.

Surrey Police have now issued three fresh pictures of Billie, in her Sea Scouts uniform and at a wedding, as officers pursue reports that she was spotted near her school yesterday.

Detective Inspector Martin Stables, of the missing persons unit at Surrey Police, said: 'It is three days since there has been a concrete sighting of Billie and our inquiries are continuing, with a dedicated team of officers pursuing leads and working to locate her.

'She was reportedly seen in the vicinity of her school yesterday and we are trying to confirm this sighting, but our concern grows as time goes on and I would urge anyone with information which might help with the investigation to contact Surrey Police urgently.'

Billie has links to the Hull and London areas, and officers were continuing to conduct inquiries in those areas to find her.

She is described as white, 5ft 2in tall, of slim build and with long brown hair.

She was wearing a blue hooded top over her school uniform of black trousers, blazer and a white shirt, when she disappeared, but was carrying a bag which may have contained other clothes.
