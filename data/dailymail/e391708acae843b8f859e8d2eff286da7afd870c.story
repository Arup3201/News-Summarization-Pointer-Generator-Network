Splashing a large amount of cash on a flashy engagement ring may seem like a great way to show your partner you care - but it could doom the marriage from the start.

Researchers have discovered that people who spend large amounts on engagement rings and/or their weddings, increase their chances of getting a divorce.

And spending less than $1,000 (£620) on an engagement ring increased the chances that the marriage would last.

Researchers have discovered that people who spend large amounts on engagement rings, and, or, their weddings, increase their chances of getting a divorce. Spending less than $1,000 (£620) on an engagement ring (stock image) increased the chances that the marriage will last

Economics professors from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, surveyed 3,000 adults who had been married at some point during their lives.

They discovered that participants who spent between $2,000 (£1,250) and $4,000 (£2,500) on an engagement ring were 1.3 times more likely to get divorced.

The ideal cost of an engagement ring is between $500 (£310) and $1,000 (£620) because spending any less than this is also linked to higher divorce rates.

Furthermore, the economists found that weddings that cost in excess of $20,000 (£12,445) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce, compared to couples who spent between $5,000 (£3,111) and $10,000 (£6,223) on their big day.

Engagement ring: The study found that spending between $2,000 (£1,250) and $4,000 (£2,500) on an engagement ring increases the chance of divorce by 1.3 times.

The ideal cost of an engagement ring is between $500 (£310) and $1,000 (£620) because spending any less than this is also linked to higher divorce rates.

Women with engagement rings over $2,000 (£1,250) were three times as likely to complain of stress caused by wedding-related debt.

The big day: Weddings costing in excess of $20,000 (£12,445) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce.

The average cost of a wedding in the UK and US is now around $30,000 (£18,668).

Debt: A 2013 survey by insurance firm Sheila's Wheels revealed that 12 per cent of British couples have more than £3,000 of debt to pay as the result of splashing out on their big day.

It found that one in eight newlywed couples have sold wedding gifts to try and recoup costs and over half of them think wedding costs are out of control.

This may be bad news for many couples, because according to figures by The Knot, the average wedding costs $30,000 (£18,668) in the US and almost exactly the same amount in the UK.

A recent survey by insurance firm Sheila's Wheels found that one in eight newlywed couples are selling wedding gifts to pay for their nuptials, and more than half of couples think wedding costs have spiralled out of control. 

The economists believe that the link between expensive rings and wedding days, and divorce rates, may be down to the financial stress put upon bride and grooms.

The new study found that women with engagement rings over $2,000 (£1,250) were three times as likely to complain of stress caused by wedding-related debt as those with smaller rocks.

In contrast, those who spent less than $1,000 (£620) were up to 93 per cent less likely to be stressed out by the cost of their wedding.

The economists wrote in the paper: ‘Our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry’s general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes.’

They did however find that big weddings are best if done on a shoestring. 

Having more guests at a wedding increases the chance of a long marriage, they concluded.

But buying a cheap ring - less than $500 (£310) - also saw high divorce rates

Spending $1,000 (£620) or less on a wedding decreased the chances of getting divorced- possibly because of fewer financial worries
