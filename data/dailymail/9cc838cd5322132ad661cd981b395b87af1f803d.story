Former cricketer Sir Ian Botham said the RSPB was more interested in political lobbying 

A group of landowners has accused Britain’s biggest nature charity of misleading donors over how it spends its money.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work.

But the landowners – led by former cricketer and keen shot Sir Ian Botham – said the charity was more interested in political lobbying than protecting wildlife.

Yesterday they reported the RSPB to the Charity Commission, claiming the organisation, which received £122million in grants, donations and commercial income last year, spent just £30million (24 per cent) on its bird reserves. 

Sir Ian, who runs a commercial shoot at his home in North Yorkshire and is one of the leaders of the You Forgot The Birds campaign, said: ‘It is a massive bureaucracy where donations are spent on homes for office workers not homes for birds. 

'Birds don’t need hundreds of campaigners and lobbyists in suits – they need people with spades building habitat.’

Ian Gregory, the campaign’s director, said: ‘The RSPB seems to be more interested in political lobbying than conservation, which they seem to think is a bit boring.’ 

RSPB spokesman Grahame Madge said last night that managing nature reserves was only a tiny part of the charity’s conservation programme and that other activities, such as research and advising farmers, were also important.

A total of £69million is spent on conservation, a further £19million on education and political lobbying, and £32million on fundraising, he claimed. It is the latest in a series of clashes between the charity and rural campaigners.

The RSPB has criticised farmers over grouse shoots and blamed their use of pesticides for declining bird numbers, while landowners complain that the charity is heavy-handed in the way it tries to police the countryside.

But as many a frustrated photographer will tell you, birds usually disappear the second you lift up the camera.

But with a lot of patience and a heap of tempting mealworms, one enthusiast has earned the trust of the birds in his garden to the point that he has them eating out of his hand, allowing him to picture them closer than ever before.

The 49-year-old father of two, known only as Villager Jim, even has names for his feathered friends: Deirdre the blue tit, great tit Georgie, a brown sparrow called Jack and Ralphie the robin.

The photographer, from Foolow, Derbyshire, said: ‘It’s all down to the power of the mealworm. It’s a joy but you have to be patient. 

'Their instinct is to fly away so it’s really special when they trust you enough to stay. Now they follow me and sit on the fence next to me. It’s wonderful.’
