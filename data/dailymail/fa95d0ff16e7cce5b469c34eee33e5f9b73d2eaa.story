While big sister Kate was speaking out about addiction on the Wythenshawe housing estate Pippa Middleton was doing her own bit for charity, albeit a little closer to home.

The 29-year-old recently became an ambassador to the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire and today she was on hand to open the centre's new £2million boarding house facilities.

Wearing a smart two-piece boucle suit the duchess's sister posed playfully for the cameras alongside the school's new mascot, a large wicker hare created especially for today's ceremony.

Pippa wanted to work with the charity after being introduced to their work through a family friend and guests at the event included the supporters who have helped the school to raise the funds required for the £2 million project. 

The willow sculpture of a giant hare was made especially for the opening by artist Tom Hare and funded by the Worshipful Company of Basket Weavers.

The Mary Hare School is a charity for profoundly and
severely deaf children and young people from all over the country.

Pippa said: 'It gives me great 
pleasure to be a supporter of Mary Hare and make a difference to the 
lives of deaf children. I wanted to help out, because this is a local 
charity close to my family's home
and I have been charmed by the inspiring children that attend, not 
least for their charismatic and heart-warming attitude to life.'

Like so many charities, Mary Hare 
depends on fundraising to provide its services to deaf children and 
their families.

They hope Pippa's support will benefit the organisation in many 
ways – not only with fundraising but also to help promote the School to 
more families of deaf children in the UK.

Mary Hare Principal Tony Shaw said: 'Mary Hare spends a lot of time and energy  finding new ways of telling 
families of deaf children about its work.  We really value Pippa’s 
support which will undoubtedly bring the School to the attention of a 
much wider audience.

'I want every family of a deaf child in the UK to 
know about all the options for their child’s education, and that 
includes Mary Hare School.'
