Paul Scholes has admitted that 'as a Manchester United fan' he was sorry to see Danny Welbeck leave his former club for Arsenal on transfer deadline day.

Welbeck marked his £16million move to north London with two goals for England against Switzerland on Monday night and looks likely to feature for the Gunners against Manchester City on Saturday. 

Speaking in the Independent, Scholes said: 'I was pleased for Danny that he got two goals after eight days in which his career has changed in a big way.

'I have said before that, as a Manchester United fan, I am sorry to see Danny go to Arsenal. He will be a good signing for them.'

Scholes also believes Welbeck will be able to offer 'something different' to United's Premier League rivals.

He added: 'He gives every team he plays for something different, and never more so than on the counter-attack when he covers that pitch from end-to-end at an incredible speed.'
