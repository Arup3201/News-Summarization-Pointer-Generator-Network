Apps such as Tinder and Grindr have created a ‘hook-up’ culture, but sometimes you may not want sex, or even a relationship - sometimes you just want a cuddle.

And that’s where the Cuddlr app comes in.

Cuddlr is a location-based meeting service that connects and matches people who want to hug strangers.

The app encourages you to hug any age or gender user, regardless of whether you find them attractive or not, and provides ‘gentle, no-pressure intimacy.’

Cuddlr is a location-based app just for cuddling. To request a cuddle from a specific person, or respond to someone else’s request, tap the photo of the user. Each request is sent with directions, a brief message, such as  ‘I'm wearing a red coat shirt’, and cuddles can be rated afterwards

Cuddlr was created by Chicago-born Charlie Williams, who is now based in the south west of England.

To request a cuddle from a specific person, or respond to someone else’s request, tap the photo of the user.

Each request is sent with a brief message, such as ‘let's meet at the park’ or ‘I'm wearing a green shirt’.

Cuddlr finds the closest ‘cuddlers’ in walking distance and shares their first name, picture, and successful and problematic past cuddles.

Each request is sent with a brief message, such as ‘let's meet at the park’ or ‘I'm wearing a green shirt’.

Cuddlr then shows walking directions between the two users, and once they meet and have a cuddle, they give a thumbs-up – as long as everything went well.

However, in the event of an awkward or inappropriate cuddle, one user can another.

The app also lets users share pictures of cuddles, and, request another hug.

When users decide to have a cuddle, the app also gives  walking directions to each other, so they can meet up.

'It's a way of finding people near you who are up for a cuddle, without any pressure or expectation,' said the developers.

‘Our culture doesn't have a space for closeness without pressure.

‘The way we talk about meeting and sharing space and contact with someone assumes that it's centered explicitly around sex and dating, or based on the kind of affection a parent might show a child.

‘We're not getting the right type of contact often enough; we don't give and get enough hugs.

‘Hooking up is certainly not always a bad thing, but there's definitely an under-explored time and a place for a more gentle, no-pressure intimacy, and that's what Cuddlr aims to help with.’

In the event of an awkward or inappropriate cuddle, members can report the other user. Push notifications can alert users to requests (pictured) and the app also lets users share a picture of the cuddle

However, in the event of an awkward or inappropriate cuddle, one user can report the other.

The app also lets users share a picture of the cuddle, and, request another cuddle through the app.

The app deliberately doesn’t feature a chat function, photo albums or shared interests because, as the developers explained, this can keep users from actually meeting.

Instead, on Cuddlr, users are encouraged to get together straight away, and then part ways.

Users can choose to share contact details after a cuddle, in person, although this is optional.

For potential cuddlers, users will see how many successful and unsuccessful cuddles they've had in the past.

Users with a substantial proportion of reports are unlikely to have their requests accepted, and Cuddlr bans anyone who is consistently using it improperly.

In addition, the app doesn’t share the user’s location until they’ve indicated they want to cuddle a chosen person, and users can be blocked.

The app doesn’t currently have filters for age or gender.

‘We encourage you to consider cuddling with people who you wouldn't date, sleep with, or even find attractive - as well as those you would,’ said the developers.

‘For that reason, while you can scroll past anyone or decline their cuddle requests, and you can block individuals, we do not have built-in filters for categories of people.’

The app is currently only available for iOS, but Mr Williams told the MailOnline the Android app is in the works, but isn't likely to launch until next year.
