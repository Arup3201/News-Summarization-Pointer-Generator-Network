Alan Rusbridger has announced that he will step down as editor in chief of the Guardian after 20 years

He announced he was stepping down after 20 years at the helm of the newspaper in a series of Tweets

Mr Rusbridger joined the paper, founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, as a reporter in 1979 and became editor in 1995 succeeding Peter Preston.

In his stint in the top job, he has guided it through a change in format - it went from broadsheet to Berliner when many of its rivals went tabloid - and a move of office from London's Farringdon to Kings Cross.

He has guided the paper through the online revolution which has seen it commit itself to the principle of open access and attempt to become an international brand with offices in Australia and the United States. 

Although the Guardian was one of the first newspaper to embrace the online format, it has since been overtaken by the MailOnline.

While Mr Rusbridger has been at the helm of  the Guardian it has also successfully defended libel action from Jonathan Aitken, a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, over claims about his dealings with leading Saudis.

It has also allowed British spies into its London offices to oversee the destruction of  computers used to store top-secret documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The paper and its editor received journalism awards for both stories.

But it has not all been success. In March this year the Guardian Media Group announced they had completed the sale of its 50.1 per cent stake in Auto Trader.

The move came as Guardian News Media reported a loss of £30.9m for the year to the end of April 2013.

Latest circulation figures also show Guardian, down from 350,000 to 180,000,.

In an email to staff Mr Rusbridger said today: 'It's been quite an extraordinary period in the life of the Guardian. In February 1995 newspaper websites were, if they existed at all, exotic things: we were still four years off launching Guardian Unlimited. Since 1999 we've grown to overtake all others to become the most-read serious English language digital newspaper in the world.'

'Each editor is told – this is literally the only instruction – to carry the Guardian on 'as heretofore'. That means understanding the spirit, culture and purpose of the paper and interpreting it for the present. All that is only possible because of the unique Scott Trust, set up in 1936 to ensure the Guardian survives in perpetuity.

In an email to staff Mr Rusbridger said his 20 years in the top job had been 'quite an extraordinary period in the life of the Guardian'.

'In global journalism, there are a handful of roles that have the capability to redefine our industry. I am privileged to have held one of those roles for 20 years, a period in which successful newspapers have become global content providers, reaching audiences in dramatically new and valuable ways.

'I am honoured to succeed the quite brilliant Liz Forgan as chair of the Scott Trust, preserving the independent editorial values and the long-term financial stability upon which our future depends. We have strong future leaders in place with unparalleled news and digital experience, and I know that our journalism will be in the best possible hands.' 

Dame Liz Forgan, whom he will replace at the trust, said he had been the paper's 'driving force ... for a generation'.

The paper - along with the Washington Post - won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism this year for its work on secret surveillance work carried out by the American National Security Agency. 

His full tweet read: 'Announced tdy that I will succeed Liz Forgan as Scott Trust Chair in 2016. Great honour to be asked to take this role.

'Scott Trust founded to protect and safeguard Guardian. Important bastion of free speech & journalistic independence.

'Will step down as editor in chief of the Guardian after 20 years next summer.'

Janine Gibson, a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media and editor-in-chief of theguardian.com, is the favourite to become Alan Rusbridger's successor

Paddy Power has started taking bets on who will become Alan Rusbridger's successor. 

So far Janine Gibson, the editor-in-chief of theguardian.com and a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media, is the favourite with odds of 2/1.

Katharine Viner, deputy editor of Guardian worldwide and editor-in-chief of Guardian US, follows in second with odds of 3/1 while Paul Johnson, a deputy editor of Guardian News and Media, and head of news, business and sport, follows at 5/1.

Gibson joined the Guardian in 1998 and went on to launch its New York-based  operation   in September 2011 as US editor-in-chief. 

Journalist and playwright Viner took over the role earlier this year when Gibson returned to the UK as editor-in-chief of theguardian.com and a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media.Viner had previously launched Guardian Australia in May 2013 as its editor-in-chief.

Johnson joined the Guardian as a reporter covering the Midlands and later became a member of the teams that investigated the 'cash for questions' scandal.

As assistant editor and then deputy editor, he is responsible for  day-to-day editing and publishing of the paper.
