'Breaking Bad' the popular television 
show on AMC leaves viewers breathless for more television. Does it also 
make viewers hungry for methamphetamine?

Blake Ewing, an 
assistant district attorney from Austin, Texas, believes the television 
show that some critics say is, ‘the greatest show of all time,’ may 
actually draw more people closer to experimenting with the drug.

According
to the opinion piece the prosecutor wrote featured on Time.com, while 
the show, ‘may not glorify meth in the sense of making it attractive to 
the average viewer, it does normalize the idea of meth for a broad 
segment of society that might otherwise have no knowledge of that dark 
and dangerous world.’

Ewing is a prosecutor in a town where methamphetamine is the greatest narcotics problem. Unlike other prosecutors he’s encountered who, ‘refuse to watch any show that glorifies that lifestyle’ he is an avid fan who can’t help himself from watching.Just because the show is good, doesn't mean that's not bad, according to Ewing. Even though he thinks that ‘Breaking Bad’ is 'great art' he reminds audiences that, ‘great art affects culture negatively. We can acknowledge that fact without calling for censorship or puritanism.’This is not the first time ‘Breaking Bad’ has been criticized for bringing meth into popular culture. Now, kids can follow of the adventures of Walter White as well as adults.

The toy company Citizen Brick recently released a play set called, ‘Superlab’ with which children can build their very own drug den.

While the set closely resembles Lego, the Danish company said, 'This set is a product of Citizen Brick, and is not sponsored, authorized or endorsed by the LEGO Group, owners of the registered LEGO(R) trademark.'

The set is complete with masks, drug paraphernalia, and the show's notable characters. The £160 toy caused outrage among twitter users. The item still sold out.

Blake Ewing concludes his opinion piece by encouraging viewers to watch the show because of it's captivating and masterful execution. But he is conflicted.

He states, 'I’ll have misgivings. I’ll continue to wonder about the long-term effects of mainstreaming such a dangerous drug into popular culture. I’ll be mindful that there are others for whom the consequences of drug addiction are a miserable and persistent reality, not merely the stuff of a TV drama, no matter how “gritty” and artful and captivating.'
