Rangers striker Kenny Miller has opened the door to a shock Scotland return — if he gets an emergency SOS call from national team boss Gordon Strachan.

The 34-year-old retired from the international scene last August after scoring the last of his 18 goals for Scotland in a 3-2 defeat to England at Wembley. 

Despite Strachan wanting Miller to stay on, the travelling from Canada, where he played for Vancouver Whitecaps, to Scotland was largely behind the veteran forward’s decision to call time on his Scotland career after 69 caps.

Now Miller is back at Ibrox and, while he has no plans to come out of international retirement for good, he revealed he would never let his country down if injuries and suspensions hit hard in the upcoming qualifying campaign for the European Championship Finals in France 2016.

‘If a call came in a time of crisis, I would find it hard to say no because everyone knows what playing for my country meant to me,’ said the striker.

‘I made that decision (to retire) purely on the travel from Vancouver for the games. MLS doesn’t shut down like our own domestic league in Scotland so I was maybe missing one or two games because of the travel and I wanted to be fair to myself, Scotland and Vancouver.

‘I’m back home now and I haven’t thought about doing a U-turn or anything like that. But if that call was to ever come then I think everybody knows what my answer would be. But I won’t be making any calls myself.’

Miller also admits he would be delighted if the next generation of strikers — like Steven Naismith, Steven Fletcher and Ross McCormack — can end Scotland’s 18-year wait to appear at major finals.

He said: ‘If you look at the team at the moment, things are going fantastic and they have got a lot of players in that position coming through.

‘You’ve got Naisy, Fletch and wee Rossco who has just moved to Fulham for big money (£11million). These lads are coming in and doing a great job. I believe we are moving under the right direction with the manager and I’m happy to sit and watch the boys hopefully reach the Euros.’

Rangers manager Ally McCoist, meanwhile, admitted there was still room for improvement after his side’s latest tour match, despite recording a 2-1 victory over US third-tier side Sacramento Republic.

Despite being pleased at his team’s second-half performance, the Ibrox boss was left displeased by the lack of urgency his side showed before the break, going behind to a goal from Carlos Martinez before second-half goals from Darren McGregor and Ian Black secured the win.

McCoist said: ‘You could see in the second half we were a lot better but I thought up until then there was a lack of aggression in our play. I don’t mean we should be running around kicking people. I just mean we should be attacking the ball, passing the ball quicker, dictating the tempo.

‘That was lacking in the first half but the second half was night and day. For me, the biggest difference in the second half was that Darren McGregor and Marius Zaliukas attacked the ball. It’s not rocket science. Our performance was better and that came from the centre backs setting the tone for the whole team.’

Ahead of tonight’s friendly against Victoria Highlanders in Vancouver Island, McCoist has injury worries over winger Fraser Aird and defender Richard Foster, who limped off with a tight hamstring. Miller and Lewis Macleod also left Bonney Field with minor knocks.

McCoist said: ‘The top of Fraser’s knee has swollen up but it’s coming down and he’s getting ice treatment on it. I’m just a bit concerned we’re flying to Canada and that may keep the swelling up.

‘Hopefully I’ll try and get Fraser involved again in Canada but we’ll need to wait and see how he is. Foster’s hamstring is tight and Kenny Miller and Lewis Macleod took a couple of kicks.’
