Two fraudsters fleeced the Student Loans Company out of £370,000 before spending their cut of the money on expensive holidays and Rolex watches, a court heard.

Mustafa Ali, 22, and Daniel Buchanan, 31, were jailed for a total of seven years today after submitting scores of bogus applications for student credit.

Ali, the 'architect' of the scam, spent his ill-gotten gains on trips to Dubai, Florida and New York, while he and Buchanan also bought themselves a selection of designer watches.

The pair supplied fake A-level exam certificates for people who didn't have the qualifications they needed to get into university.

Once they had been accepted onto courses, Buchanan and Ali took a cut of the new undergraduate's loan for their 'services'.

As the pair were jailed at Southwark Crown Court, the judge said that students who had worked hard for their qualifications were denied places on college courses because they had been taken by people who took advantage of the fraud.

Ali and Buchanan charged £1,000 a time for fake A-Level certificates but their fees depended on the level of service they offered.

They 'kept tabs' on each student, monitoring their accounts to ensure, once the loan was eventually approved, they received a cut for their 'services'.

High life: Mustafa Ali, 22, spent his share of the money on a trip to Dubai and other luxury destinations around the world

All expenses paid... with a scam: Ali, 22, also flew to New York with the money he made from his scam

In total, the SLC issued £368,469 worth of loans after 174 requests were made on behalf of 150 people.

The pair are believed to have pocketed tens of thousands of pounds as their share of the scam, although the exact amount is unknown.

In many cases the applicants withdrew from their courses before applying to other universities to claim another loan with Buchanan and Ali's help.

Buchanan, who at the time was studying criminal law and criminology at London Metropolitan University, created false qualifications to get onto his course.

He 'recruited' students to take part in the con while Ali, a former business administration student at Southbank University, administered online applications.

The scam took place between September 1, 2011, and December 5, 2012, when 79 applications were successfully processed. They were eventually caught after fraud investigators 'eavesdropped' on their phone conversations.

In a separate con, Buchanan was part of a gang of criminals who laundered more than £25,000 of fake money through a branch of Barclays Bank in Lewisham, southeast London.

Daniel Buchanan boasted that he could get a male friend onto a degree course with fake qualifications in a telephone conversation.

He said he got into university himself to study law without passing his A-Levels.

Buchanan and Ali created fake A-level certificates, then pocketed a share of the student loan when it was paid out.

In the conversation on November 16, 2012, they said:

Male: 'how can I get in without any qualifications?'

Buchanan: 'I can sort that out. My brethren 
makes it all up innit. He makes up all the qualifications, everything.

'You go, you rumble, you're in, you start studying. Do your modules, 
anything. I'm doing it now. I'm doing a degree in law. I've got my 
little usb stick.'

Male: 'your brethren is going to have to sort me out because I need to get on a course'

Buchanan: 'I could get you a degree in English ak, I could get you an English degree.' 

Male: 'I want electrical engineering.'

Buchanan: 'I can get that still.'

They took advantage of a quick cash deposit facility, paying in envelopes stuffed with crude banknote-sized pieces of paper, 'book-ended' by £20 notes, on nine occasions in September last year.

The gang then withdrew the cash, with Buchanan using part of it to purchase airline tickets.

Ali was jailed for four years while Buchanan was handed a total of three years in prison.

Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said Ali was 'at the very heart' of the scam, describing him as 'the architect' and 'prime mover'.

Buchanan 'enthusiastically' joined the plot when it was already in existence, the judge said.

'This was an extremely serious fraud not only because it caused the Student Loans Company to pay out £368,000 which it should not have, but in the making of false applications for student loans, supported by false exam certificates, it undermined the whole college entrance system.

'Some students who wanted to go to college and had the necessary qualifications would have been prevented from doing so because those places were taken by people who had fraudulently taken advantage of the services you two were offering.

'In offering those services, you were encouraging others to act in a criminal way which may well bring some of them before the courts.

'This was a highly sophisticated scheme which was fraudulent from the outset and extremely profitable, and it would have continued to be so, if the police had not intervened.'

Buchanan was also ordered to pay back 
just £8,447.42 gained from the SLC con and the money laundering, within 
six months, or face a further six months in jail. A confiscation hearing
for Ali will take place at a later date.

Buchanan and Ali acted as 'service providers' in the SLC scam, said prosecutor Timothy Cray.

Detectives today released a damning text exchange between Ali and a potential client in which he boasted he could create fake A-level certificates to get someone into university.

Client: 'I got some of mi mates that wanna do dis uni ting dis year can u help them out'

Ali: 'yh how old are they'

Client: '21, 22 nd that' 'How much is it nd how quick can u do it'

Ali: 'Yh I can get then a levels to get into Uni each yeh' 'Gonna cost dem 600 each' 'And they will be able to get into Uni'

Client: 'Any uni yhh' 'Nd I get a cut yh ??'

Ali: 'Yh don't worry il sort u out just 
line them up for me' 'Normally I charge them 1000 when ther loan comes'

'But tell then pay 600 cash and il give there things'

'And when der loan
comes they gotta pay 400'

'Their service included the provision of false exam certificates, submission of applications and monitoring of online accounts that were opened.

'In return, they received payment from successful applicants.'

'Mustafa Ali was the administrator of the fraud with responsibility for online activity.

'The crown's case is he was the prime mover in the fraud. Daniel Buchanan was the recruiter. They got the cash from the people who had collected their own loans.'

The SLC system depends on 'trust', Mr Cray added.

'There is no stipulation as to what the money can be used for and the loan company do not check how it is spent.'

Naeem Main, defending Buchanan, a married father-of-two, insisted his actions were not out of 'mere greed'.

'He is not somebody who has had the advantages afforded to many of us. He is not somebody who has had the traditional route of education open to him,' he said.

'He is someone who has taken his responsibilities towards his family extremely seriously and that's what drove him to commit these offences.'

Emma Phillips, for Ali, described him as 'naive and immature'.

Ali, of Shadwell, east London, admitted conspiracy to defraud while Buchanan, of Tottenham, north London pleaded guilty to the same charge and converting criminal property.

Richard Walton, Commander of the Counter Terrorism Command, said: 'This was a major student loan scam. Buchanan and Ali criminally exploited the student loan system; legitimate students across the country will be thankful for these convictions.'

The case was handled by the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit because of their specialist expertise. There was no link to terrorism.

Heather Laing, Fraud Prevention and Detection Manager at SLC said: 'This case and the sentence they have received has sent a very clear message that the courts take fraud against the taxpayer very seriously.

'We worked closely with the Metropolitan Police, using the analytical tools we have in place to help identify individuals and gather evidence, helping to piece together the wider criminal activity that SLC and the police had identified.

'At SLC, we have a robust system of checks and safeguards in place for the administration of student finance and applicants cannot obtain funding without providing the relevant evidence to prove their eligibility. In addition, students must also have their attendance and registration confirmed by their place of study before any loan or tuition fee payments are paid out.'
