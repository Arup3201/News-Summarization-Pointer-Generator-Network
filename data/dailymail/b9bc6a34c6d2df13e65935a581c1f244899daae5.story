Lord Patten faced demands to quit or be sacked last night as civil war tore through the BBC.

The chairman of the BBC Trust was given an ultimatum after being accused of ‘fundamentally misleading’ Parliament over the scandal of excessive pay-offs to Corporation fat cats.

But the defiant former Conservative Party chairman said he had ‘no concerns’ about the allegations made by former director general Mark Thompson.

Mr Thompson has sent a dossier to MPs as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the BBC’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay.

In it, he suggests that Lord Patten was briefed on the pay-offs shortly after taking over as chairman from Sir Michael Lyons in 2011.

But in July this year Lord Patten said he ‘didn’t know’ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to MPs.

Both men now face a showdown before the influential public accounts committee on Monday. Tory MP Rob Wilson said they were ‘fighting like ferrets in a sack’.

Yesterday Mr Wilson said the chairman and three other senior BBC figures should ‘resign immediately or be sacked’ if they were shown to have misled Parliament.

Denial: In July this year Lord Patten said he ¿didn¿t know¿ about the full extent of the scandal while giving evidence to MPs

He said Lord Patten, human resources chief Lucy Adams, BBC Trust director Nicholas Kroll and trustee Anthony Fry had all been accused of ‘re-writing history’ by Mr Thompson over the severance payments scandal.

Mr Wilson said: ‘They must all be required to answer each of the accusations Mr Thompson has made against them.

If they or anyone else is found to have done so without a proper excuse, they will have endangered the integrity and honesty expected of the BBC and must resign immediately or be sacked.’

As the row intensified, former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw declared that the BBC Trust should be scrapped.

And in a further twist, Miss Adams –who is quitting as head of HR after signing off multiple big pay-offs to senior managers – confessed that her own evidence to the committee had been ‘mistaken’.

Controversy: Mr Thompson has sent a dossier to MPs as he seeks to rebut damaging claims that he was at fault for not making the BBC’s governing body fully aware of controversial payments to former executives Mark Byford, left, and Sharon Baylay, right

Mr Thompson hit out at Lord Patten in a 25-page submission ahead of his committee appearance next week.

‘The picture painted for the PAC by Trust witnesses on July 10 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of Trust knowledge and involvement,’ Mr Thompson claimed.

‘The insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence.

Here is what Lord Patten and Mark Thompson have said so far about whether the Trust was aware of payments of £1million to departing deputy director general Mark Byford and £394,000 to former marketing director Sharon Baylay:

LORD PATTEN:

At the public accounts committee, on July 10, chairman Margaret Hodge asked him: ‘Should the Trust have known? [about payments exceeding contractual obligations]’

Lord Patten: ‘Yes, and if you call a previous director general of the BBC in due course, I will be as interested as you in why we didn’t know.’

Speaking yesterday he added: ‘I’m obviously going to save my remarks principally until I appear in front of the committee on Monday, which I’m looking forward to.

'I have no concerns at all about the remarks Mr Thompson has made.’

MARK THOMPSON:

In his written submission to MPs, he says: ‘Lord Patten was fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011.

‘A detailed briefing on the settlements was prepared for Lord Patten and myself to prepare us for questions from the Press and parliamentarians on the two cases.

'The settlements also came up in a series of preparatory meetings and rehearsals which Lord Patten and I both attended.’

Mr Thompson also encloses a briefing note which he says Lord Patten was given shortly after arriving as BBC Trust chairman in 2011.

It sets out questions the BBC might be asked about the sums given to Mr Byford and Miss Baylay, and suggests ways to justify the payments.

The note appears to give ammunition to both sides.

In one answer, it describes the sums as ‘contractual payments’,  which will be helpful to Lord  Patten because he claims the Trust was unaware of any ‘extra- contractual payments’.

But in another answer, the note says Miss Baylay ‘received... payment for notice, a redundancy payment... and an additional compensation payment’, which lends weight to Mr Thompson’s assertion that it was made clear there was money on top of what the BBC was contractually obliged to pay.

‘Lord Patten was fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011.’

Mr Thompson has included a copy of the 2011 briefing note with his evidence. He added: ‘Two years later [Lord Patten] would claim he felt “shock and dismay” but in July 2011 he did not raise the topic of senior manager severance at all.’

Lord Patten has denied misleading the committee and has branded Mr Thompson’s submissions ‘bizarre’.

He said yesterday that he was relishing the chance to return to the committee, but would save his comments until then. ‘I have no concerns at all about the remarks Mr Thompson has made,’ he said.

On July 10 Miss Adams told the public accounts committee she had not seen a crucial note detailing plans for pay-offs – but now she admits she not only saw it but helped write it.

Her ‘clarification’ was published after Mr Thompson branded her evidence ‘inexplicable’ because she had been one of the ‘main authors’ of a 2010 note.

It set out how £1million of licence fee payers’ money should be lavished on a ‘golden goodbye’ to departing deputy director general Mr Byford and a further £394,000 to former director of marketing Miss Baylay. Their pay-offs were among a string of lucrative severance deals in which £25million was paid to departing BBC staff from 2009 to 2012.

BBC bosses past and present are now locked in a bitter war of words over who knew what and when.

The astonishing sum was uncovered by the National Audit Office.

Mr Wilson said it was not enough for the Trust to dismiss the allegations as ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘The evidence of Mr Thompson has blown a hole in Lord Patten’s argument that the Trust was only responsible for “strategy” and had no operational involvement in executive pay-offs.

‘He [Lord Patten] must urgently shore up confidence in his position and he can only do so by answering each of the specific allegations made by Mark Thompson. The cloud gathering over his position will only darken if he fails to do so.’

But he said the stakes were also high for Mr Thompson, who is now the boss of The New York Times.

He said: ‘If Mr Thompson’s allegations are found to be wrong or untruthful, I believe his position as chief executive of The New York Times would be untenable.

'It is not altogether surprising that Mark Thompson and Chris Patten are fighting like ferrets in a sack.

'As the light has been shone into the dark corners of the BBC, people with questions to answer have begun to mount campaigns to save their own skin.

'They’ve been caught out and it’s now become every senior executive for himself.’

Marcus Agius, who was chairman of the executive board remuneration committee, backed Mr Thompson’s version of events.

But in a statement, five BBC trustees poured scorn on Mr Thompson’s claims that ‘multiple documents establish’ that details of the pay-offs were disclosed to the Trust before settlements were approved.

'Richard Ayre, Diane Coyle, Anthony Fry, Alison Hastings and David Liddiment said: ‘We were not asked for approval of [Mr Byford’s] financial package – formally or informally – nor did we give it.’
