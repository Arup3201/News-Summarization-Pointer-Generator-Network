Anyone with a spare few million might like to consider this impressive home.

If they have deep enough pockets they could land themselves Britain's most expensive Tudor mansion - which has just gone on sale for a cool £9.5m.

Grade II listed Isfield House near Lewes, East Sussex, boasts its own billiards room, gun and rod room and swimming pool.

Being just 55 miles south of London it would seem to make an ideal retreat for wealthy businessman and city financiers.

Isfield Place started life as a motte and bailey castle under Henry VIII but is now the most expensive Tudor mansion in Britain on sale at £9.5m

The idyllic gardens to the rear of the mansion, which are immaculately trimmed by a dedicated team of gardeners and would make for a perfect summer evening party

Blue skies dotted with clouds create an idyllic scene over the mansion, just like they would have hundreds of years ago when it was first built

The River Ouse even runs through part of the eight-bedroom 16th century property's estate - ideal for anglers who would enjoy a spot of weekend fishing.

The property has always been privately owned since being a motte and bailey castle under the reign of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I.

Since then it has survived a civil war, an industrial revolution and two world wars. Despite the age, the mansion is as impressive today as it would have been 500 years ago.

The oak beams across the roof of the living room give a clue to the heritage of the building, as does the brick fire place, which could warm the new owners in the winter

Plush: The oak-panelled dining room could provide a magical setting for many dinner parties, served up by a team of cooks

A spokesperson for estate agents 
Savilles, who are handling the sale, said: 'The first record of the 
settlement is a motte and bailey castle site, believed to have been 
owned by the De La Warr family.

'From the early to mid 16th it underwent a transformation by the Shurley family.

'A new mansion was designed to accommodate guests of the Shurley family, who included Royal household officials.'

Warm: A log fire rages in another of the mansion's main rooms, which has plenty of room for sofas and arm chairs for the whole family to gather round in

Every chef's dream: The granite surfaces and 'island' in this very modern kitchen could be used by a keen cook to prepare luxury meals

Library: A solitary book case currently lies in this reception in the £9.5m mansion, but it could be easily be transformed into a library

Comfortable: The master bedroom in the country mansion 55 miles south of London has its own fireplace.. and views over the estate's 311 acres of land

Other features include a tennis court, reception room and drawing room.

Two cottages and one flat are included in the estate, as well as several more outbuildings.

The 311 acres of land within the grounds include woodland, arable and pasture.

This patio swimming pool is plenty big enough to stretch the arms and legs before enjoying the rolling views across the countryside

Properties: This is one of two cottages in the grounds of the mansion. It could be used to guests and family members

A second cottage has had various uses over the years, including as a store room for gardeners tasked with keeping the sprawling meadows and pastures looking fine

One for grandmother? This addition to the main building could make the ideal 'granny flat' for elderly relatives... or even a place for grown up children to stay

A magnificent oak-panelled dining room could provide the setting for many fine dinner parties, while the kitchen is big enough to accommodate a team of chefs and waiters to serve.

While to burn off all those calories there is a goo-sized patio swimming pool with breath-taking views of the immaculately-trimmed front gardens.

In the evenings, the future owners will no doubt enjoy doing what generations before them have, and relax in the wood-floored living room with the heat of the roaring log fire set in a brick fire place keeping them warm.

Noble: Anyone who splashes out £9.5m on the mansion will surely have enough to pay for the upkeep of a few fine horses in the mansion's stables

Tranquil: The River Ouse even runs through part of the eight-bedroom 16th century property's estate - ideal for anglers who would enjoy a spot of weekend fishing

The mansion has 311 acres of land, including pastures, arable and even woodland - plenty of room for a long walk or canter on the horses from the stables

There are stables close to the main building - and plenty of room in which to gallop steeds across the rolling fields within the grounds of the estate.

The spokesman added: 'The house, which is set in the heart of its own land, dates back to the early 16th century and provides a wonderful core to this historic estate.

'The eight-bedroom manor house, which has been the subject of refurbishment and improvements, is surrounded by outstanding formal gardens and supported by modern and traditional farm buildings, two cottages and a staff flat.

'Accessed via a long gated drive and protected by its own land with no public rights of way near the house and gardens, it commands magnificent unspoilt views south towards the Downs.'
