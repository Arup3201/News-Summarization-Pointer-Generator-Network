A competition which sees Chinese women taking selfies of their underarm hair is sweeping the country's version of Twitter.

Young women are flooding the Chinese website Weibo with images of their unshaven underarms in a bizarre social media trend.

The competition, called 'Girls not plucking their armpit hair' is said to be challenging social norms and encouraging women to keep their body hair.

So far, thousands of pictures have been uploaded to the site, with the competition's page gaining over 28million views.

Many of the images show the women proudly showing off their underarm hair, while others are pictured with their ponytails tucked under their arms.

It is thought that organisers of the competition will eventually put together a top 10 of the best pictures, although there doesn't seem to be any prize for first place.

It appears that the trend has swept China after several other campaigns that have urged women to embrace their natural beauty.

Last month, the Hairy Legs Club trend on tumblr was inviting women to post their photos to make a statement about social expectations of beauty.

It features pictures of women from around the world, who have decided to ditch the razor and not shave their legs and have uploaded pictures of themselves to the site.

While female students at an Arizona university last month were being offered the chance to earn extra credit by not shaving their armpit hair for a whole semester.

The unconventional offer was made by women and gender studies professor Breanne Fahs at Arizona State University as a way to get her students to challenge social norms.

And earlier this year as part of the Natural Beauty series, London-based photographer Ben Hopper recruited dozens of models and actresses to grow out their body hair with the aim of proving that they don't need to conform to expectations to be attractive.
