England swept lowly San Marino aside - CLICK HERE for our amazing match zone. 

Here was an ominous warning for the provincial cities. This is precisely the kind of low-grade international football heading your way if England steps aside to make way for more American Football at Wembley Stadium.

The Cowboys, the Jaguars, the Falcons and the Lions are on the way later this year. It makes you wonder if Thursday's crowd was swelled by dyslexic gridiron fans hoping to catch a glimpse of legendary quarterback Dan Marino.

It was one of those largely pointless one-sided exercises served up in every qualifying campaign, where Roy Hodgson only has to make sure his team turn up on the right day to secure the points.

He did and they did and, as Switzerland lost in Slovenia, England may at this rate qualify for Euro 2016 with years to spare.

What will that do to the crowds at Wembley? No wonder the idea is back on the agenda to move some of these less-appealing games to cities where international football is more of a novelty and smaller stadiums, which fill up more easily.

Since Wembley is not likely to surrender its A-list fixtures. These will be the ones earmarked for the travelling circus.

It was a terrific effort by nearly 56,000 who came along and by England who coped well with the no-win task at hand. Hodgson's team did their best to entertain, sustained a healthy tempo, and never attempted to coast or simplify their football.

Five goals did not reflect their utter domination and plenty of chances were missed, many by Wayne Rooney, who might have scored half a dozen but inched within seven of Sir Bobby Charlton's 49-goal record - six if he can claim the fifth which swerved in off defender Alessandro Della Velle. Hodgson wanted to give it him. 'Rooney all day,' he beamed.

The opener came from the unexpected source of Phil Jagilka, Danny Welbeck continued his fine goal run and Andros Townsend came off the bench to score his first international goal for a year. San Marino boss Pierangleo Manzaroli was happy with five.

Adam Lallana, marked out for praise by Hodgson, had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside, there were some remarkable saves from computer science student Aldo Simoncini and Townsend was denied by a late goal-line clearance.

It may have been a glorified training session but it was a spree to lift spirits ahead of Sunday's qualifier in Estonia, which promises to be a little trickier, and Hodgson was able to report there were no injuries of note, another key element of the night.

With his international players falling lame at a rate of one a day, Arsene Wenger must have been among those who looked away. Five Arsenal players started the second-half, including Calum Chambers and Kieran Gibbs in their first competitive England game.

Well, competitive in the sense that there were points at stake. This particular competition was to see who could puncture the double layer of dark blue insulation on the edge of the Sammarinese penalty area and beat Simoncini.

Two years ago, Simoncini protected his goal for more than half an hour. Here, he was beaten after 24 minutes when he came hurtling from his goal-line in pursuit of James Milner's corner and tripped over his team-mate Luca Tosi.

As the goalkeeper crashed to the ground, Jagielka leapt to nod the ball into an unguarded net. It was the 172nd goal conceded by Simoncini in 40 games. It would be 176 by the end of the night. If he were bothered by the avalanche of numbers, he would have packed in long ago, as would San Marino for that matter.

For them, they have a right to compete on the international stage as the world' s oldest republic but it is debatable.

Simoncini was soon launching himself Superman-style towards Gary Cahill's head underlining the danger of UEFA's comedy mismatches: a student high on adrenalin propels himself like a human missile at the head of a player currently negotiating a £120,000-a-week contract at Chelsea.

In truth, England could have few complaints about the way San Marino played. There were some clumsy challenges, but Milner was the first to be booked, raising the question of a how an England player manages to ease to the brink of suspension in a game like this.

The night's second yellow card went to San Marino's veteran striker Andy Selva, who was back in his own penalty area, attempting to clear the ball when he kicked Rooney in the face. Rooney's spot-kick would have beaten even a professional goalkeeper.

It was another crash back to earth for Simoncini who had just produced a splendid reflex save to turn a shot over from Welbeck and the cue for Hodgson to start making changes with the trip to Tallinn in mind.

The limbs of Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson were to be preserved, a sign of how important the Liverpool pair have become to their country.

And, with San Marino beaten, the fluent movement of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and vision of Lallana helped England ease clear. Oxlade-Chamberlain set up the second for Welbeck at the near post, within four minutes of the restart.

Lallana had his first England goal wrongly disallowed for offside before Townsend cut inside from the right to score and Rooney, having fluffed one elaborate attempted chip, scored with another, helped by the deflection.

And the best part? It is over. On to more important matters.
