Katie Mulrennan, from County Kerry, applied for a job in Seoul, but was informed by an agency that their client would not hire an Irish person because of their perception of the nation's drinking habits

An Irish teacher was told she wasn't being considered for a job in a South Korean school because of the 'alcoholic nature' of her people.

Katie Mulrennan, from County Kerry, applied for a job in Seoul, but was informed by an agency that their client would not hire an Irish person because of their perception of the nation's drinking habits.

The 26-year-old, who has taught English for more than three years, in Barcelona, Oxford and Abu Dhabi, said that she could not believe the email was real at first because schools usually don't bother replying, or tell her they would prefer a teacher with an American accent.

Miss Mulrennan, who does not drink alcohol, told MailOnline: 'It's quite ridiculous, I was really taken aback.

'Coming from Ireland you get used to the stereotype that people have and you joke about it but to be refused a job because of it is most unfair.

'I was very frustrated by it.'

The email said: 'I am sorry to inform you that my client does not hire Irish people due to the alcoholism nature of your kind.'

She replied saying she does not drink, or consume animal products, but has not heard back.

She added: 'I didn't send them a harsh reply.

'I contemplated doing that but you don't know what they might do with your résumé. 

Miss Mulrennan, who has been living in Seoul for the past year, said she had been searching for a new job after her last teaching contract in the city had come to an end.

She said that many schools in Seoul prefer to hire ex-pat teachers who are American, and she has found that often they do not want a teacher with an Irish accent. 

'I have had some emails from recruiters on previous occasions they would prefer Americans,' she said.

'I was told by one recruiter to speak in a Skype interview with an American accent, he said "I advise you speak with an American accent to get this position".

'I thought it was crazy - they know I'm not American, they are looking at my CV and they know I'm Irish.' 

She does not know who the recruiter was as their details were not listed on the ad, which she had seen on the Korean version of Craigslist.

Miss Mulrennan said many schools in Seoul prefer to hire ex-pat teachers who are American, and she has found that often they do not want a teacher with an Irish accent.

'They don't usually give the names of the private schools, they just tell you what the job is,' she said.

'I was urgently seeking a job so I wasn't fussy and this was in central Seoul so I sent my CV and they emailed back.'

English graduate Miss Mulrennan said she suspected that the recruiter who sent the email had only done so because the advert had been posted anonymously. 

'I couldn't imagine them sending that email if the recruiter's id was out there because it would damage their reputation but it is frustrating that I can't report it.'

She added: 'If they had met me in person and made a judgement on my character I would understand but they didn't even speak to me on the phone,' she said.

'I don't think they had any right to do that at all, it's infuriating.' 

A friend suggested she post the email and it went viral. Fortunately she found another teaching job at a private academy, and says she still 'loves' Seoul and South Korea.

She also said she had been inundated with further job offers from around the world after her rejection email went viral.

Ironically, earlier this year it was reported that South Koreans drink more alcohol than Britons, Russians and Americans put together.

The average person of drinking age in South Korea knocks back 13.7 shots of liquor per week - more than in any other country in the world.

South Korea’s unparalleled liquor consumption is almost entirely down to the country’s love for the fermented rice spirit Soju. The South Korean liquor accounts for 97 per cent of the country’s spirits market, according to Quartz.

Hard drinking has become a growing issue in South Korea forcing the government to launch a marketing campaign to reign in its citizens.

'Almost every night in almost every police station lockup in Seoul, drunken men - and sometimes women - can be found abusing officers verbally and even physically, as a widely tolerated way of banishing anger,' reported the New York Times in 2012.

'They usually are allowed to sleep it off and go home, their punishment no more than a small fine.'

'A problem with the way South Koreans drink is that they drink fast to get drunk fast,' an official at the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation told the paper.

Many South Koreans, who work some of the longest hours in the world, believe that one of the quickest ways of building friendship and office camaraderie is to get drunk together, the Times' report added.
