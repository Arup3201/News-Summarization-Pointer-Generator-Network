As fireworks lit up the heavens above the Olympics opening ceremony, watched by around a billion people, something else was seen among the whizz-bangs in the night sky... a UFO.

It may have ticked all the cliche boxes - saucer-shaped, bulge in the middle, metallic - but no one has yet stepped forward to explain the slow-moving object.

The incident came right at the close of last Friday's spectacular at the Olympic Park stadium in Stratford, east London at around 12.30am.

And it was just as Nick Pope, one of the UK’s top UFO experts, predicted only weeks ago - that mass summer events would be a prime time for crafts from other 
worlds to present themselves to mankind.

This UFO was seen at the Olympics opening ceremony in Stratford, east London

It may have ticked all the cliche boxes - saucer-shaped, bulge in the middle, metallic - but no one has yet stepped forward to explain the slow-moving object

One theory is that the 'spaceship', whose presence was reported by Examiner.com, was a blimp used by a news channel to gather footage.

But
 while NBC Olympics - a division of NBC Sports - has picked Goodyear 
blimps for all of its 2012 Olympics aerial coverage, the object does not
 look like one of the floating airships.

Some commentators on YouTube believe it is actually a helicopter - or simply a fake.

Mr Pope, who worked at the Ministry of Defence 
for 20 years, investigated reports of UFOs between 1991 and 1994.

Aliens may be visiting Earth for military reconnaissance, scientific research, or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some tourism

Here are some of the theories regarding the Olympics UFO...

He began his research as a sceptic, before becoming convinced that 
the sightings raised important defence issues for national security and air 
safety.

Speaking earlier this month, he said: 'It has been a widely held 
belief in Ministry of Defence circles that "aliens" have been able to 
detect us for decades via TV and radio broadcasts.

'What once seemed like science fiction is steadily being realised by central governing bodies as distinctly real.

'If aliens have studied our 
psychology, they may choose to appear in our skies on a significant date.

'The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games is one date being widely 
circulated by conspiracy groups.’

The footage is believed to have originated from a web user known as 'MrScipher'.

Tony Blair and the 'UFO cover-up'

Two weeks ago, it was revealed that former prime minister Tony Blair 
received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of 
his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on alien 
life-forms.

Downing Street 
requested the advice for the PM in 1998 as the Freedom of Information 
Act was being introduced, which allowed the public to obtain information
 on alien mysteries.

Ex-PM Tony Blair received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on extraterrestrials

Mr 
Blair's concerns were raised after he received a letter from a member of
 the public referring to a 'cover-up' and asking him to make UFO reports
 and other information available.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Blair sought advice from the MoD for its policy on the issue.

He
 was told by staff at the ministry that it has 'only a limited interest 
in UFO matters' but that they ' remained open-minded' about 
'extraterrestrial life forms'.

Details
 of the briefing emerged ahead of a release of files on July 12 by 
the Government of more than 6,700 pages  detailing seemingly close 
encounters with UFOs over the last 30 years.

Among
 a series of UFO sightings in the files is a  policeman's report of a 
mystery cluster of lights darting across the sky during an FA Cup replay
 between Chelsea and Manchester United.

The
 mounted officer's claims to have seen the bright object hovering over 
Stamford Bridge in March 1999 for almost 15 seconds, slowly changing 
shape, were corroborated by a colleague.

The
 ‘credible witness report’ is one of a series investigated by the 
Ministry of Defence, whose top-secret files are being released in 
sections by the National Archives following the closure of the 
ministry’s UFO desk in 2009.

One confidential 1995 report by the 
defence official responsible for manning the desk says the presence of 
extra-terrestrial lifeforms is ‘possible’, although there is ‘no direct 
evidence’.

It also speculates on the reasons why
 aliens may be visiting Earth, including for military reconnaissance, 
scientific research, or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some 
tourism.

The
 policeman claimed that he saw something ‘unlike anything I’ve seen 
before’ at Stamford Bridge while Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-0 in 
the FA Cup quarter final replay

He said a ‘square to almond shape’ yellow object with four lights floated silently above his horse.

Another file describes a West Wales 
hotelier who saw a UFO landed in a field. Two ‘faceless humanoids’ in 
silver suits emerged and took measurements
