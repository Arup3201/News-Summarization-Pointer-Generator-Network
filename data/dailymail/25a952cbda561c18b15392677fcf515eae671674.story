Parents have removed their children from a primary school after the governors banned packed lunches.

At least six children have been taken away from Milefield Primary School in Barnsley because of its strict new policy which aims to have all pupils eating a freshly cooked school dinner.

The change follows new rules, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, which force schools to provide a free hot lunch to infants aged four  to seven.

Unhappy: The Martin family, who protested over the move. Adam, 31, and Claire, 30, have now taken their three children - Harry, four, George, five and Amelia, seven - out of the school and moved them elsewhere

New rules: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has introduced compulsory hot meals for all four- to seven-year-olds

Decision: Milefield Primary School in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire, told parents of the policy in a letter sent home on the last day of term in July - and it was implemented upon the children's return last Friday

Milefield Primary decided to offer the hot lunch to all pupils, charging those aged over seven £1.75 a day. Children who don’t want the school dinner can be collected and taken home for lunch.

But some families are upset that packed lunches, often cheaper to prepare, have been banned. They fear fussy children will end up going without as the school only offers one choice of meal.

Parents were told about the meal policy in a letter from the headmistress on the last day of term in July.

Paula Murray has said she is proud of the change, which has been backed by a majority of parents.

But Adam Martin, 31, has taken his children Harry, four, George, five, and Amelia, seven, out of the school over the dispute.

Angry at the decision: IT consultant Mick Curphey, 39, and his wife Debbie, 37, have kept their children - William, eight, and Beth, seven - in school because they do not want to disrupt their education

Defence: Milefield Primary School - rated 'good' by Ofsted inspectors - has stood by its decision to ban pack lunches - and headteacher Paula Murray said it was 'encouraging the promotion of healthy eating'

Mr Martin, a gas engineer, said: ‘I feel like our freedom of choice has been taken away. We were appalled to be told our children couldn’t take in packed lunches and further incensed with how the school have dealt with the situation.

'We like our kids to have a packed lunch because, not only does it save us money, but it also allows you to let your children eat what they like.’

He added: ‘The packed lunches we make are healthy, we don’t  need somebody to tell us what our children should be eating.’

His attempts to communicate with education authorities over the summer had failed, he said.

Parents who had hoped to discuss the meal policy with teachers on the first day of term were met by two police community support officers.

Mr Martin said he had allowed his two sons to have the school dinner but sent his daughter with her usual packed lunch.

He then received a phone call from the school asking what she was going to eat, as her packed lunch had been confiscated.

‘Maybe the school meal is good value but when your child doesn’t want to eat any of it then it’s too expensive,’ Mr Martin said.

He said his children’s new school offers five different meal choices and allows packed lunches.

A spokesman for Barnsley council said six children from three families had so far been removed from the school.

Q&A: The answer to Question 7 explains what parents should do if they want to give their child home dinners

Headmistress Mrs Murray said no one was being ‘forced’ to participate as parents could take their children home for lunch if they chose.

She claimed the cooked lunch policy was having a ‘positive impact’.

‘We’re encouraging the promotion of healthy eating,’ she said.

‘We have to work towards what’s best for a large proportion of children in the school – over 97 per cent of parents are in favour of the changes.’

The Government has set aside £1billion over the next two years to cover the cost of the hot meals, which will be provided to all pupils without any means testing.

Options: On the first day back at school Mr and Mrs Martin took their children to school, leaving Harry and George to have a cooked school dinner - and Amelia went with her packed lunch
