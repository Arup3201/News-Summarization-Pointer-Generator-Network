Livestock, carnivorous plants and 'a whole box of doctor gloves' are just some of the requests found in a hilarious collection of children's letters to Father Christmas.

But among the pleas for toys, games and, er, pigs, there are a number of queries from inquisitive youngsters who are keen to use their missive to Santa to pick his brain.

One child asks for a cat, dog and a pig for Christmas, while another wants a big horse and a box of doctor's gloves among other things.

A modest request: Nicki doesn't want much this year, just 'cat, dog, pig', and she's drawn three helpful pictures so Santa doesn't get confused

One cheeky child tries their luck 
requesting Santa brings all the presents early, and another wants 
the whole picture, demanding to know what other children are getting before he makes his demands.

Concerned about his friend Carter, Cullen wishes to know whether or not his buddy made the 'nice list'.

Another excited child asks for a real Venus Flytrap and 
Lightsaber, while one poor mite admits it is not necessary to bring him anything at all, because he has been 'somewhat bad' this year.

Promising they've been good this year, a couple of the children attempt to butter up the delivery man, telling Father Christmas they love him and that he is their 'best pal'.

There are also several questions 
about the existence of Rudolph and his famous red nose, while one young man wishes to ascertain facts about the largest cookie Santa has ever eaten.

One inquisitive youngster asks a series of questions, including, 'What are you getting for my sisters?'; 'How tall is 
the average elf?' and 'Did you stick the gifts in the basement because 
there was no room in the sleigh?'

Understanding: This unnamed writer admits that have been 'somewhat bad' this year, so understands if Santa decides not to get them anything at all

Quick quick! This cheeky chap doesn't mind what presents Father Christmas brings, just so long as he brings them early

Your best pal: Joshua knows the way to Father Christmas' heart, but he also has a couple of queries about Rudolph's famous nose

Rainbow request: This dilligent child spent such a long time writing their letter in multicoloured pens that they forgot to sign their name at the end...but hopefully Santa will still be able to find them

Timing is everything: This little boy has been good for 'about three years', so thinks it's fair enough to make some requests from the big man

A Venus fly trap, a scooter and The Nightmare Before Christmas: Quinn seems to be hatching some sort of plot, but needs Father Christmas' help to carry it out

Flattery will get you everywhere: Cullen is curious about whether or not his friend Carter made the 'nice' list, and why he found all those presents in the basement....

A picture paints a thousand words: Sadie illustrates her letter with a picture of the doll's house she's after

Missing the point: Timothy is less bothered about sending his toy requests to Santa and much more curious about the biggest cookie he has ever had to eat while delivering presents

Please? Eva promises that she has been a good girl, and that she is still trying to be a good girl

Excitable: Some young writers got so carried away with excitement while writing their letters to Father Christmas that they appear to have lost their train of thought...

A helping hand: Charles is very clear about what he wants, and very neat, but it soon emerges that his mum may have helped with his penmanship
