Forensic scientists have identified the remains of a woman found buried at the estate of Hitler's deputy Hermann Goering 21 years ago as those of his wife Carin.

Carin, born Carin Fock in Sweden, died aged 42 in 1931 and was buried in her homeland.

But as Goering rose through the Nazi ranks he had her body exhumed and transported to his massive hunting lodge outside of Berlin called Carinhall in her memory.

As the Red Army advanced on the estate early in 1945 Goering ordered his vast art collection to be transported to safety and the place dynamited.

Ever since then it has a been a magnet for weekend treasure hunters who pore over the ruins convinced they will find missing masterpieces in the rubble and undergrowth.

In 1991 they did find a chest with human 
remains which was sent to Sweden's National Board of Forensic Medicine 
for identification.

An expert called Marie Allen and her colleagues, together with Anna Kjellström at the Stockholm University osteoarchaeological research laboratory, have now used state of the art methods to determine whose they were.

Analyses of the total of 26 bones showed that they were from an adult woman while DNA analyses confirmed that they are from a woman.

The researchers then performed two kinds of genetic analyses.

A comparison of so-called mitochondrial DNA evinced identical DNA sequences between the skeleton and Carin Goering's son, indicating a mother-child relationship.

'The variant of mitochondrial DNA we saw in the bones is a relatively common one, occurring in about 10 per cent of all Europeans.

Therefore we went on to study nuclear DNA," said Ms. Allen.

They were able to show mother-son kinship.

'The results of our anthropological 
and genetic analyses, together with historical data, provides several 
pieces of evidence in the identification of the remains of the former 
Nazi leader Hermann Goeing's wife, Carin Goering.,' she added.

After the testing the remains were reburied in Sweden with family members present.

Goering,
 who founded the Gestapo secret police, organised the bombing of 
defenceless cities in WW2 and was a prime architect of the Nazi 
Holocaust, was sentenced to death at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials.
