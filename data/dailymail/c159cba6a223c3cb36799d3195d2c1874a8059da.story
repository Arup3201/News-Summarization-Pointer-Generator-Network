A number of Australians are sending the Attorney-General a very clear message of what they think about the government’s proposed new metadata retention laws - straight to his iPhone and his email inbox.

Those opposed to the Abbott government’s plan to force telcos to record all Australians' calls, texts, and emails so that it can be freely accessed by police and intelligence agencies have begun trolling George Brandis’s Apple device and copying him into all of their emails.

The bill to retain so-called metadata for a minimum two years has been drafted as a counterterrorism measure but the bill does not specify what metadata is and experts differ on definition.

Mr Brandis's bombardment comes as the Senate  censured him for seeking the resignation of Human Rights Commission boss Gillian Triggs and failing to defend her from 'malicious attacks'.

The fallout from the public spat between the government and Professor Triggs continued on Monday when the upper house spent hours debating the Labor motion condemning Senator Brandis over his handling of the issue.

Opposition Senate leader Penny Wong claimed the attorney's 'deplorable' treatment of the commission and its president made him unfit to hold office as the nation's most senior law officer.

Senator Brandis vigorously defended his position, claiming the public deserved to know why the government had lost confidence in Prof Triggs.

Delaying an inquiry into asylum-seeker children in detention until after Labor lost office could only be seen as protecting that side of politics, he said.

'To say that is not to attack her character, or to be a bully-boy, it is merely to explain why a conclusion has been reached,' he told parliament.

Software engineer Justin Simon first realised that he could send an iMessage direct to Mr Brandis’s phone on Sunday by spotting his publicly available email is linked to his Apple device, BuzzFeed revealed. 

Mr Simon then shared the revelation on Twitter with the crudely worded tweet: ‘Hey c*** how’s tricks?’

Other Twitter users then followed suit by trolling Mr Brandis’s iMessage account with messages.

Luke Vurens wrote: ‘Hello Mr Brandis can I please see your harmless metadata? It’s for security purposes. Don’t worry, if you’re not doing anything wrong you don’t have anything to free.’

A grassroots campaign called Help Curious George also served up the Attorney-General’s email address and encouraged the public to ‘cc senator.brandis@aph.gov.au on all your emails’.

‘Attorney-General George Brandis is very very curious. He wants to know exactly what we're all up to online. And the phone. Email, Facebook, Twitter. Calls, Texts, Skype. Friends, Family, Politics. The lot!,’ the online campaign reads.

‘We like “Curious George”. He's such a clever little monkey. But he's really not too technical. Please pledge below to help George feed his insatiable curiosity.’

Emily Lockwood pointed out that Mr Brandis has a physical similarity to Muppets character Professor Bunsen Honeydew.

‘How do you feel about looking like one of the dumbest muppets?,’ she emailed him.

The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 bill will be debated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.

The government wants to be free to set the definition without consulting Parliament after the bill becomes law.

Those opposed to the government's data retention plan began the social media hashtag #StopDataRetention

In its review of the draft bill, Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee recommended that the definition be set in the legislation rather than decided by government through regulations.

In describing metadata, the government uses the analogy of traditional mail. The metadata is the information written on the envelope, not what's written on the letter inside.

With telephones, metadata includes the number called, the duration, time and date of the call, plus the location of the cellphone. It does not include the contents of the conversation.

But the Internet is a grayer area.

George Williams, a University of New South Wales law professor, said the recommendations addressed his two major concerns with the legislation: that it failed to specify what metadata was and failed to say who could access it.

Attorney-General George Brandis said the government would make a public response next week. It could ignore the recommendations, but to do so would likely doom the legislation to rejection in the Senate, where the ruling conservative coalition does not hold a majority.

Ben Jenkins also took the opportunity to troll Mr Brandis once the campaign began

Several countries have laws on metadata retention. U.S. laws allow government access to metadata with or without a warrant.

Australian police say they already access metadata, but are concerned that many companies don't store it for as long as they used to. Several companies have warned that the new retention obligations would cost them and their customers millions of dollars.

The Attorney-General’s website unveiled the estimated cost on Sunday.

‘The Attorney-General’s Department has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to cost the implementation of the proposed data retention regime in consultation with industry.

‘PwC estimated the upfront capital cost of the regime to all of business to be between $188.8 million and $319.1 million, which is less than 1 per cent of the $43 billion in revenue generated by the telecommunications industry annually,’ the website states.

‘This estimate will inform the Australian Government in delivering on its commitment to make a reasonable contribution to the capital costs of implementation of the data retention regime.

Because Australians are among the worst in the world for illegally downloading movies and video games, many fear that prosecutions won't stop at terrorists.

The Attorney-General’s website states: ‘Australia needs a data retention scheme because telecommunications companies are retaining less data and keeping it for a shorter time. This is degrading the investigative capabilities of law enforcement and security agencies and, in some cases, has prevented serious criminals from being brought to justice.’
