Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos promised cocaine ‘white sweets’ to a bogus film producer who offered her a  leading movie role alongside Leonardo Di Caprio, a court heard yesterday.

The 26-year-old pop star, who once described herself as a ‘drug dealer’s wife’, allegedly arranged to supply cocaine to Samir Khan because she thought he was a ‘big shot’ Bollywood producer offering her a blockbuster role ahead of Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet.

But her dreams of being a movie star were shattered when Mr Khan turned out to be undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, who exposed her in a tabloid newspaper sting.

Former X Factor judge: Contostavlos, 26, continues to vehemently deny helping to broker the deal

Southwark Crown Court heard the N-Dubz singer was filmed boasting she could easily sort out ‘white sweets’ – allegedly her code for cocaine – as she was once part of a gang that sold crack and her ex-boyfriend was a major cocaine dealer.

Beguiled by talk of a movie loosely based on her life as a ‘street kid, someone who rises up from the streets and is making a better life’,

Contostavlos was ‘queuing up’ to offer drugs and strip-club parties to the undercover reporter offering her the big break, the jury heard.

In a series of phone calls and texts, she is accused of arranging for her rapper friend Michael Coombs to take a bag of cocaine to a luxury suite at the Dorchester Hotel in London, where Mr Mahmood was staying.

Coombs, 36, whose rapper name is Mike GLC, has already pleaded guilty to supplying the drugs.

Jurors were played footage from May 23 last year in which he was seen removing a white bag containing 13.9grams of cocaine from his sock and placing it on a table in exchange for £820.

On trial: Contostavlos also allegedly bragged that she used to be part of a gang who sold crack cocaine and that her ex-boyfriend was a cocaine dealer

The jury heard Contostavlos first met Mr Mahmood in March last year when he approached her.

Posing
 as a wealthy Bollywood movie maker, he wooed the singer and Gareth 
Varey, described in court as her manager, in top hotels in Las Vegas and
 Mayfair and with dinners at Nobu restaurant, a favourite with 
celebrities.

The court 
also heard Mr Mahmood offered to get her on the red carpet at Cannes 
Film Festival and said he could make the star and her then boyfriend, 
former Newcastle United star Danny Simpson, the David and Victoria  
Beckham of India.

‘She 
and her manager swallowed the story completely,’ said prosecutor Timothy
 Cray. ‘She was told that she would be more suitable for the film than 
Keira Knightley or Kate Winslet.’

He added: ‘Although she had not 
negotiated the price or the amount, she had done all she could to make a
 supply of cocaine happen. It’s very clear to the extent of her falling 
for the trick – she is queuing up to arrange this.’

The excited star was filmed saying: ‘I
 could probably get a good Hollywood sexy role in a movie but it would 
not be a leading movie. When this part came along I was like, a leading 
role for the first time…it’s almost perfect.’

When
 Mr Mahmood asked her to provide cocaine on a night out, she said she 
did not abuse cocaine but could easily get some ‘white sweets’ for him 
through  her friends.

Rapper: Mike GLC, whose real name is Michael Coombs, 36, pleaded guilty on Monday to supplying half an ounce of cocaine for £860

Earlier,
 she bragged that ‘she used cannabis to help her get to sleep and that 
she had connections to drug dealers’, Mr Cray said.

‘In her drug-dealing
 speak, white sweets equals cocaine, green sweets equals cannabis.’

The
 jury heard that within minutes she was contacting an ex-boyfriend 
saying ‘need sum sweets’, but he told her his phone was tapped.

She
 then contacted Coombs before promising Mr Mahmood ‘white sweets’ on his
 return from Cannes.

She texted: ‘Let me know wen u land so I can sort u
 out! Love Tulisa xxx’.

In
 other calls she told him she had arranged for him to visit a 
pole-dancing club called Whites.

Mr Mahmood can be heard saying: 
‘Talking of White, what about white sweets?’ Contostavlos replies: ‘I 
can definitely sort it, I just need to make some more calls.’

Mr
 Mahmood responds: ‘Obviously, just keep this between us.’

Giggling, the
 singer says: ‘It wouldn’t sound too good that Tulisa is off finding 
white sweets.’

Days 
later, Coombs was caught on camera as he handed over the drugs, Mr Cray 
said.

The powder was found to be just 37 per cent pure, despite Coombs’ 
boasts it was ‘100 per cent grade A stuff’.

The
 star’s alleged drugs deal was reported in the Sun on Sunday by Mr 
Mahmood who also reported her to police. She was arrested on June 4 last
 year.

She told police: 
‘I was trying to find a role in a film. [The journalists] asked me a 
number of intimate questions. I answered these sometimes in an 
exaggerated manner in an attempt to seek the part.

‘My words have been taken out of context. I’m not a drug dealer.’

She had been dropped as a judge on The X Factor two weeks before her arrest.

Contostavlos, of Friern Barnet, North London, denies being concerned in the supply of cocaine between May 10 and 23 last year.

The trial continues.
