Passport: American-born Randall Cole, 44, says he had to answer 'clearly homophobic' questions when he attended a routine interview to get a British passport

A passport official has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation after a gay man complained he was interrogated about his personal life in front of his four-year-old son during a routine passport interview.

Randall Cole, 44, says he was grilled for half an hour by a Home Office employee in Chelmsford, Essex, about whether he had ever had sex with a woman, why his son's biological mother had given him up, and what passers-by thought when they walked past him and his husband with their two adopted sons.

The American-born charity worker, who is married to a Brit and became a British citizen in May, said that when he objected to her questioning in front of his small child, the woman said: 'We can ask anything we want'.

Mr Cole has filed a formal complaint to the Home Office, and the employee is currently suspended while an investigation is held into the matter.

He said he was shaking after the interview, which was conducted in the middle of an open-plan office and left him feeling violated.

The father of two adopted sons said that the atmosphere in the 'clearly homophobic' interview changed when he explained that he had two adopted children with his husband, Stuart Wales, 42, and the passport official realised he was gay.

Despite him being accompanied by his son Samuel, four, Mr Cole said he was asked whether the children were biologically theirs, what Samuel and his brother Benjamin, eight, thought of their birth mother, and whether they were confused by their family set-up.

Mr Cole said that he explained that even if the boys' birth mother were there too, if one of them fell over, he would run to him rather than her, but says the Home Office employee merely sighed and shook her head.

He told the Guardian: 'Then she said: "What do you think people make of you when they see you walking down the street with your kids?"'

And he said she went on to quiz him about whether the boys called their biological mother 'Mum', forcing him to explain to his small boy about him coming out of his mother's 'tummy' but him and his husband being their parents.  Mr Cole said the line of questioning in front of his son left him upset that he had 'failed to keep him safe'.

He said that when he said he worked part-time, the woman dismissed him as playing the 'housewife' role in the couple, and then her questioning became even more personal.

'She said: "You must have had relationships with women in the past, though?"'  He said at this point he objected, but she was having none of it.

'She became indignant and said: "We can ask anything we want, regardless of whether or not it makes you feel uncomfortable,"' he said.

Mr Cole, who married human resources manager Mr Wales in California but moved to Britain because of its reputation for tolerance, said the woman was clearly trying to humiliate him and put him in his place.

He said she told him that he could refuse to answer questions but that his refusal would be noted in his application, and that she continued to press for answers on the point of whether he or his husband had ever been sexually active with women.

The Home Office website says that during the interview for a first British adult passport: 'You'll be asked to confirm facts about yourself that someone trying to steal your identity may not know'.  Passport interviews are routinely recorded.

This morning a Home Office spokesman said: 'People applying for their first British passport are required to attend an interview designed to detect and deter those trying to obtain passports fraudulently.

'Intrusive questions about someone's sexuality as part of an interview would be inappropriate and is not a reflection of our policy.

'HM Passport Office expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from our staff and takes allegations of misconduct extremely seriously.

'The member of staff in question has been suspended and a disciplinary investigation is now underway.'

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told MailOnline: 'It's truly shocking in this day and age that a Home Office official can behave in this intrusive and bigoted way.

'I'm delighted that the official has been suspended.  No-one applying for a passport should be subjected to such humiliation for any reason. 

'It shows that the Home Office needs to do more to train its staff to be sensitive and non-homophobic.'
