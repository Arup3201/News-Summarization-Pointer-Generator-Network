Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the UK must build new houses to avoid boom and bust

The Governor of the Bank of England has issued a stark warning that the booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy – and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid further catastrophic boom-and-bust cycles.

Mark Carney said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand, and that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were beginning to borrow heavily again.

His warning comes as house  prices soar in some parts of Britain – although in other areas they remain stagnant.

Mr Carney said: ‘The biggest  risk to financial stability, and therefore to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing market, and that’s why we are focused on that.’

Contrasting Britain with his native Canada, he added: ‘The issues around the housing market in  the UK… [are] that there are not sufficient houses built in the UK.

‘[There are] half as many people in Canada as in the UK, [but] twice as many houses are built in Canada every year than in the UK.’

Official figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in England in the 12 months to March and that the number of new properties being started is rising. But the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007.

Mr Carney – who issued the warning in an interview with Sky News’s Dermot Murnaghan, to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that home buyers are borrowing heavily once again, with signs that loans of four times a person’s salary or more were starting to increase.

‘We don’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium term,’ he said.

‘We would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high  loan-to-value mortgages across the banks... we’ve seen that creeping  up and it’s something that we are watching closely.’

The Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent, despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm the bubble emerging in some regions.

Last week, Mr Carney said the Bank judged the economy was still fragile and indicated rate rises were unlikely in  the near future. When they came they would be ‘limited’: ‘The recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable,’ he said.

The Bank is widely expected to use tools other than an interest- rate rise to stem excessive borrowing.

Under new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial regulation, it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves against home loans or tighten rules on lending.

The Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, which is chaired by the Governor and is in charge of the stability of the financial system, is expected to outline how it might use those powers next month.
