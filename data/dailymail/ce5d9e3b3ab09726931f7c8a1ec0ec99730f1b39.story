One popular bookmaker yesterday offered odds that Sir Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney would one day buy a horse together. The price was 8-1 if anybody is interested in wasting  some money.

Nevertheless, Manchester United manager Ferguson was in bullish mood yesterday as he presented  a rather passionate version of  his current relationship with the centre forward.

‘There’s absolutely no issue between Wayne Rooney and me,’ he said. ‘There is absolutely no problem.

Happy camper: Wayne Rooney appeared in good spirits as the Manchester United squad were put through their paces on Friday ahead of this weekend's FA Cup clash against Chelsea

Hands up: Nani, who was sent off against Real Madrid, seemed content in training at Carrington on Friday

‘He will be here next year, you have 
my word on that. There are no issues at all with the player. He’ll  be 
involved on Sunday (against  Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final), no 
doubt about that.’

Ferguson, of course, was talking in 
the wake of his decision to leave Rooney out of the team that lost — 
rather unluckily — to Real Madrid in the Champions League at Old 
Trafford on Tuesday night. More specifically, he was responding to 
subsequent reports that the  27-year-old may be sold this summer.

At the end of a week in which  
Ferguson has gone through the emotional wringer — he was too 
‘distraught’ to talk after the Real defeat — it certainly appeared that 
his blood was still up.

Facing the media: Sir Alex Ferguson hit back at suggestions Wayne Rooney would be ditched in the summer

Benched: Wayne Rooney was unceremoniously axed for the visit of Real Madrid on Tuesday night

‘To suggest we don’t talk on the 
training ground is absolute  nonsense,’ said Ferguson, even though 
nobody had actually suggested that.

‘Wayne understood the reasons for not 
playing him were completely tactical and I think we were right. He 
understood exactly what we were doing. I explained it to him before we 
announced the team and he was fine.

‘You don’t always get it right but I think we got it right.

Taking his seat: Ferguson expressed concerns about Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir prior to Tuesday's game

All smiles: Rooney appeared in good spirits yesterday despite being omitted from United's startling line-up

‘Danny Welbeck is the best player we 
have in terms of operating in a double role. We had to stop Xabi 
Alonso’s ability to control the game, which we did, and it took away his
control of the match and ability to go further forward and be an 
attacking player.

‘You don’t always get it right but we definitely did on Tuesday.’

Rooney can expect to start  United’s 
next big game, against Chelsea tomorrow. Now that talk of a rather 
unrealistic treble has gone, a Premier League and FA Cup  double remains
as a tantalising consolation.

On the ball: Ferguson opted for Danny Welbeck ahead of Rooney for Tuesday night's tie

As reported in Sportsmail this week, 
Ferguson has harboured  concerns over Rooney’s fitness but will hope he 
can continue what has been a pretty good scoring run between now and the
end of the season.

‘He does need a lot of football,’ said Ferguson once again. ‘He’s always been that type and it’s always been the case.

‘There are a lot of things you can do 
when you lose a game. Certainly we won’t give in, we will get off our 
backsides and be ready for Sunday.’

Across Manchester, Roberto Mancini weighed into the issue, saying he too couldn’t see Rooney leaving.

‘I think that Rooney is one of the 
best strikers in Europe but I think it is difficult he can leave 
United,’ said the Italian, whose side showed an interest in the England 
man two years ago.

‘It was always my opinion. Like two 
years ago when there was a chance he would leave because I think he’s an
important player for United.’

For Ferguson, focus now shifts to Chelsea.

‘A big game is the best. We’re at home and with a home draw in the FA Cup we’ll play anyone.

‘Chelsea have a terrific cup record 
themselves, the best in the last decade, and we haven’t won it for nine 
years so there are a lot of incentives for us.

Ferguson will face off against former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez on Sunday

‘Rio Ferdinand hasn’t got a medal, 
for  example, so that’s another great incentive for us.’

It is hard to 
look back on Tuesday’s defeat without giving some consideration to the 
performance of Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir, who sent off United winger 
Nani with Ferguson’s team a goal up before the hour mark.

Certainly the United manager does not seem ready to forgive just yet.

Blow: Ferguson confirmed Phil Jones was still not fit enough to return after an ankle injury

‘On the issue of the referee, quite 
simply it’s hard to keep your faith in the game,’ he said. ‘It’s the 
third time we’ve been knocked out by a referee’s decision.

‘I was definitely concerned before the game. I said that to the staff but it’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it.

‘It’s not easy to take but, in the 
cold analysis of the day, you realise we’re Manchester United and we 
just have to get on with it. Nothing can be done now and the important 
issue is Sunday.

‘It’s clear in my mind now and we have
to get on with it. It’s another day in the history of our club. Not a 
good day but another day.

Dismissed: Nani was shown a controversial red card in Manchester United's defeat by Real Madrid

One might think Manchester United fans would be calmed by their manager's words on Wayne Rooney on Friday morning. However, a glance at the history books shows it’s not the first time Sir Alex Ferguson has tried to flatten a story about one of the clubs stars after which the player is sent on his merry way anyway. 

After sensationally dropping David Beckham from a crucial Champions League 2nd leg against Real Madrid, Ferguson went on to say: 'I saw it as quite a straightforward decision. Solskjaer's form has been fantastic on the right hand side. He's impressed greatly. There are only so many times you can hit a guy over the head.

'When someone plays as well as he's been playing, what do you do? Leave him out because David Beckham's a great player, too?’

That was on April 23. When asked if he would sell Beckham, Ferguson responded: 'It is totally out of the question. There is no way we would sell him, or any of our best players.'

Beckham was sold that very July.

Watching brief: David Beckham was left out of United's Champions League match with Real Madrid in 2003

Sound familiar?

It then happened again when the Scot left out Ruud Van Nistelrooy out of United’s biggest game of the season, the 2006 League Cup Final.

On dropping the Dutchman on February 26, 2006, Ferguson said: 'I think Louis [Saha] deserved to play.  He had scored five goals in the previous games and, since he’s been fit, I think he’s scored 10 in 13 games. I think there’s a danger you can sometimes overlook it and not give him the credit, but today he deserved to play in the final.

'Ruud seemed to be okay in the dressing room and okay with the players. He will be disappointed, you have to be disappointed. I have had that disappointment myself, being dropped in a cup final, at 10 past two, when you are the top goalscorer.

'It happens and it’s a horrible life that way. Finals are terrible to pull players out and to only have five substitutes, I think it’s wrong.' 

Also pressed on whether the striker had a future with the club, Ferguson stated: ‘Of course, He’s a member of our squad, no question. He’s on a long contract and we’re very happy with that situation. He has been patient and he’s never complained..

Three months late, in July of that year, Van Nistelrooy was sold.

So United fans, if history tells us anything, then Rooney may be facing the exit this summer after all, whatever Sir Alex is trying to make you believe.
