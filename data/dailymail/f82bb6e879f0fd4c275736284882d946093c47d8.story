And a representative for the style-conscious teen explained that the clothing range  
'symbolizes Talia's sassy, brave and inspiring spirit of overcoming all 
odds.' 

Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear label called Maison De Urbana, decided to help fulfill Talia's dream of becoming a fashion designer after hearing her inspirational 
story on the Ellen show last fall.

Fulfilling her dreams: Talia with Los Angeles-based designer Urbana Chappa

She flew to Florida on April 15 to meet her at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and help bring her design ideas to life.

Talia was first diagnosed with 
stage four neuroblastoma cancer, a tumor that develops from nerve tissue
 in infants and children, on Valentine's Day in 2007 when she was just seven years old.

Following
 chemotherapy, surgery and radiation she was cancer-free for one year 
but in September 2008 doctors found the disease had spread to a 
small lymph node near her heart.

For
 the next four years she received various treatments, but after periods 
of remission the cancer kept on returning to other parts of her body.

Last year she revealed that she had neuroblastoma and leukemia at the same time.

Doctors
 suggested a bone marrow transplant as a possible remedy but Talia 
decided forgo another painful surgery and enjoy her remaining days.

Ms Chappa, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 19 but successfully overcame the disease, explained that meeting Talia was an experience 'I'll never forget.'

Trend-setter: Talia says that her favorite styles include 'preppy', 'rocker' and 'boho chic'

'Even though she was sick in the 
hospital, we made the best of our time. She's so full of life that it's 
hard for me to imagine that she has cancer.

'We talked, sketched, worked on her
 line. My heart hurts to know that she has to go through this and that 
she had so much she wants to do and accomplish.

'I wanted nothing more to keep her legacy alive.'

Talk show star, Ellen DeGeneres, also cited the youngster as an inspiration.

Inspirational eyes:  Talia, who was first 
diagnosed with with stage four neuroblastoma cancer on Valentine's Day 
in 2007,  says that make-up helps to boost her confidence

While interviewing her last October on her eponymous daytime show, Ms DeGeneres stopped to say: 'You really are quite something.

'There's a depth to your soul that is not a 13-year-old soul.

'You’re an old soul and you are very 
special and amazing, and I’m so honored that you wanted to meet me and 
that I got to meet you.'

Talia and Ms Chappa have called their clothing brand That Bald Chick, in reference to Talia's hairless appearance.

Natural beauty: Talia Joy Castellano, who charmed America with her YouTube make-up tutorials and became an honorary face of CoverGirl, has died aged 13 following a six year  battle with cancer

In
 one of her YouTube tutorials the 13-year-old explains that she doesn't 
wear a wig because they make her feel 'fake and 'just not me'. Instead 
she uses make-up as a confidence booster.

She told MailOnline that fashion also lifts her spirits and some of her favorite styles include 'preppy', 'rocker' and 'boho chic'.

All proceeds from sales of her clothing range will go to her family who face sky-high medical bills.

Doctors estimated last summer that Talia had around four to 12 months left to live.

On Wednesday she was admitted back to hospital with symptoms including nausea and vomiting.

She explains in another of her videos: 'I've gotten so many benefits from [cancer].

'Having a YouTube channel, having to inspire people and having 
people look up to me . . . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But 
every journey has an end.'
