Accused: Cedric Ricks has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her eight-year-old son

A 38-year-old man suspected of murdering his ex-partner and her eight-year-old son has been captured by police after he went on the run.

Cedric Ricks was arrested in Oklahoma yesterday after a 30-year-old woman and her son were found dead at their home in Bedford, Texas on Wednesday night.

A 12-year-old boy, who was in the property, was also attacked and is in a critical condition in hospital after he suffered a serious brain injury.

Ricks was the woman’s estranged 
boyfriend, and the two had an eight-month-old child together.

The infant was the only 
child in the apartment who was found uninjured.

A protective order the 
30-year-old victim had filed against Ricks had reportedly expired in 
January.

Authorities will now begin the process of extraditing the double murder suspect back from Oklahoma, where he was stopped in the early hours of Thursday morning, Dallasnews.com reported.

Police say they were first tipped off by Ricks’ family who called to say he had carried out the attack.

Neighbours at the Bedford apartments where
 Sanchez lived said they heard screaming Wednesday night but they never 
dreamed two murders may have been taking place.

The victim is believed to have filed an emergency protective order against Ricks in November.

The protective order ordered Ricks to stay away from his ex-partner's Bedford apartment and also the children's grandmother's house. The protective order expired on January 15, 2013.
