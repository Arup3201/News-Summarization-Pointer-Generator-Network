It had already been a particularly cringeworthy visit for tax exile Gerard Depardieu.

Then he hit the dance floor.

The French actor, 64, looked more like a dad throwing awkward shapes at a wedding when he took part in a traditional highlander dance on his tour of Chechnya over the weekend.

Hours earlier, he had flown to region's capital Grozny where he was treated to a lavish meal by its dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, who joined him for the after-dinner festivities.

Depardieu, who has
been accused of betraying his country by moving to Russia to escape a 
new 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires, has courted further controversy by touring his adopted homeland,
where income tax is set at 13 per cent.

Cringeworthy: French tax exile Gerard Depardieu hits the dance floor to perform Chechnya's highlander dance on a tour of the region

Embarrassing: The 64-year-old actor resembled a dad dancing at a wedding when he showed off his moves

Controversial: Depardieu was joined on the dancefloor by Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been ruling Chechnya with an iron fist since 2004

The actor, 64, was treated to a lavish meal by the head of the Chechen 
Republic Ramzan Kadyrov - a warlord's son who has been accused of grave 
human rights abuses - after touching down in the capital Grozny sporting
a Cossack hat.

Depardieu and Kadyrov posed for 
pictures with their arms around one another's shoulders in the 
predominantly Muslim Republic of Chechnya, and later performed a 
highlander dance known as lezginka together.

Kremlin-backed
Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist since 2004. The son of 
former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov, the 36-year-old is widely 
credited with bringing stability to the war-ravaged region. But he has 
been condemned in the international media amid allegations of serious 
human rights violations.

Depardieu,
who received a Russian passport from President Vladimir Putin last 
month, officially became a resident of Saransk on Saturday.

The actor, who has denied that he accepted the passport to escape the taxman, has now had it stamped with his new address in Democracy Street, Saransk, a city of 300,000 which lies around  400 miles east of the Russian capital.

He has been accused of national betrayal by critics in France, where President Francois Hollande plans to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent for those with an income in excess of 1 million euros.

But Depardieu is apparently unfazed by criticism aimed at him in his home country, and was pictured embracing President Putin on a trip to Russia to collect his new passport in January.

Hospitality: Depardieu was greeted with a hug from dictator Kadyrov when he touched down in Grozny yesterday

Saransk is the provincial capital of the Mordovia region, home to a sprawling web of Soviet-era prison camps, where one of the members of the Pussy Riot band is serving her two-year sentence for an irreverent 'punk prayer' against Putin.

Depardieu said at the ceremony that he appreciated the symbolism of his new address.

'I want to be an ambassador of democracy to the world,' he said, according to Russia Today television, which quoted him as saying that 'Russia is a country with a great democracy'.

Saransk has otherwise mostly retained Soviet-era street names. Democracy Street is surrounded by Proletariat, Communist, Soviet and Bolshevik streets.

Local cuisine: The newly-minted Russian citizen inspected some local cheese on a visit to a factory outside Saransk

Culture: The actor walks among a group of actors wearing traditional clothing on a visit to the Mordovian national culture centre outside Saransk

New address: Depardieu visited an agricultural complex in his new hometown of Saransk during his tour

Depardieu, who has starred in films such as 'Green Card' and 'Cyrano de Bergerac', enjoys broad popularity in Russia and received an enthusiastic welcome in the city. Showing off his knowledge of local history, Depardieu likened himself to Yemelyan Pugachev, the chief of a peasant rebellion in the 18th century.

'Yemelyan Pugachev was a peasant tsar who came to Kazan and to Saransk,' Depardieu said, according to Russia Today. 'I am like Pugachev: I am a peasant, and I want to be tsar of Saransk.'

Depardieu was registered at an apartment belonging to the relatives of his Russian friend, the head of the Gosfilmofond state film archive, Nikola Bordachev. It is not clear if Depardieu will actually live in the apartment, and he has no requirement to spend any particular amount of time there - though he promised to visit the city often. 

Depardieu's decision to accept citizenship has earned sarcastic comments from Putin's critics, who say the actor is a tool of Kremlin spin.
