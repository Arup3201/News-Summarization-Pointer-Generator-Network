So, will Lewis Hamilton be Happy after Sunday’s Formula One season finale in Abu Dhabi?

The Briton, who must finish second to guarantee the title, was, despite the semi-smiles and waves to the crowd, somewhat downbeat after Nico Rosberg stormed to pole in qualifying.

Hamilton was unable to match the supremacy of his Mercedes team-mate, but will take some comfort from the fact he starts directly alongside his rival for tomorrow’s race.

Pharrell Williams was the centre of attention when he arrived in the Abu Dhabi paddock on Saturday 

American hit-maker Pharrell Williams, responsible for the pop anthem Happy, caught up with Hamilton after the qualifying session under the lights in Abu Dhabi.

Hamilton has hinted at a career in music after he hangs up his racing gloves, but it is Pharrell who will take centre stage later on Saturday when he headlines tonight’s after-race concert on Yas Island.

Pharrell, seen garage hopping during Saturday's qualifying session and pictured speaking to former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, is the artist  also responsible for the hit ‘Lucky’. It's an adjective which could be used to describe Rosberg if he claims the championship this weekend.

Hamilton failed to put together his best lap and will start second with Valtteri Bottas breathing down his neck 

The German has won five fewer races than Hamilton this year, but would pinch the title if he wins on Sunday and Hamilton finishes outside the top two.

'It was a great day again today, it all worked out well,' said Rosberg. 'I put a good lap together in the end, but it's only one very small step. It's about the championship, not about the pole.

'I was hoping for a Williams to be between us, it didn't happen, but hopefully that can be the case tomorrow.

'My mindset now is I need to get the job done, to continue with the form I showed at the last race in Brazil. In any case I'm sure it will be a great race.'
