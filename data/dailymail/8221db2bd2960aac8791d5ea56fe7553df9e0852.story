Most young women could imagine few things worse than being told doctors were going to cut off one of their legs.

But Sun Jingjing, from Anyang city in China, was more than happy when medics broke the news to her two months ago.

The grindingly poor 22-year-old was struck down by congenital angiolipoma in her right leg at birth which made it swell to the size of her entire torso.

As the tumour grew, so too did her pain with blisters covering her leg as it dragged along the floor whenever she walked.

Triumph: Sun Jinjing was all smiles as she was wheeled triumphantly out of hospital to a rapturous applause from doctors and nurses

Tumor: The 22-year-old was struck down by congenital angiolipoma in her right leg at birth which made it swell to the size of her entire torso

Hard times: She says her leg would break out in blisters from the summer heat and dragging on the floor while winter would bring frostbite as she never had any clothes to cover it properly

The growth, a tumour composed chiefly of fat cells, is completely benign but rendered her unable to work or enjoy a normal life.Â 

'Whenever the summer came, my leg would break out in blisters from the heat and the fact it would constantly rub on the concrete floor,' she said. 'And when winter came, I even got frostbite because I didn't have clothes that would fit around it. That was incredibly itchy.'

To make matters worse for Sun, her father died of kidney failure 12 years ago, and her mother is suffering from terminal esophageal cancer.

'My mother lives a very difficult life,' she added. 'She is in almost constant pain but never complains. Instead she looks after me and I look after her.

'Even in my darkest moments she encourages me to be strong and to survive. My leg may have now gone, but my mother's cancer will not go away. Although all I want is to find a cure for her.

'If there is an afterlife, I hope to be with her again.'

Ambitions: Sun Jingjing Now she hopes to find a boyfriend, get married and have a family

Nevertheless, Sun was all smiles as she was wheeled triumphantly out of hospital to a rapturous applause from doctors and nurses.

She had never received any adequate treatment before leaving her leg to swell to a circumference of 85cm.

Now she hopes to find a boyfriend, get married and have a family.
