It's iconically Parisian, but now the secret's out. Underneath the feathers and sparkle, much of the Moulin Rouge is imported from Australia.

Janet Pharaoh, associate artistic director of the French institution, estimates that a third of the 75 can-can girls at the cabaret club are from Down Under, which is why she's currently back in the Southern Hemisphere for this year's round of auditions.

Dancers are auditioning for a place in the 125th anniversary show, which will also feature a giant aquarium, five pythons and six miniature horses.

Ms Pharaoh, herself a former dancer, headed to Sydney's Walsh Bay Pier to watch 60 girls and 17 boys strut their stuff.

They did their best to impress Ms Pharaoh with their agility, rhythm and general razzle-dazzle ability.

According to journalist Michael Koziol at Sydney Morning Herald Ms Pharaoh pulled dancers aside muttering 'not 
bad, with practice' or 'those turns were scary'.

She also measured heights
 against a marker on the studio door, telling one young man he was 'very
 promising' but needed to eat more meat, fish and eggs and 'go to the 
gym'.

Perhaps there's a place for Ms Pharaoh on next year's Strictly.

Across Australia, 400 dancers will try out for Ms Pharaoh and will compete with British and international dancers for just 20 places with legendary MoulinÂ  Rouge.

Auditions will take place in Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast before returning to 
Sydney. Ms Pharao told The Sydney Morning Herald that successful dancers will have been performing classical 
ballet and jazz since they were as young as five. And the secret formula to success? 'Great legs, super figure, fabulous 
personality.'

One dancer, Kaycee Paget, 23, who was a competitive 
gymnast for 10 years, sums up the sentiments of the hopefuls.

'It's such a big dream for any girl who's tall and 
dancing. To have the chance to be a part of something
 that's so world-renowned is just amazing,' she says.

The Moulin Rouge club in the Pigalle 
district of Paris welcomes 630,000 visitors a year for its twice-daily 
cabaret performance and turns 125 years old in 
October.

If the dancers make it through they will perform twice a night on stage at the Moulin Rouge

Can you kick it? She certainly can-can
