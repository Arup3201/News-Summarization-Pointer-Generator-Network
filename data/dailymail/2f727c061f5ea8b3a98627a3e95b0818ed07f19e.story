It's that time of year again as fans plan their away travels for the new season, where the die-hard supporters slam midweek evening travels to the other end of the country.

But there's one team you can sympathise with most, and it's little surprise they come from the north-east.

Road trip: Table showing total distance travelled and the cost in petrol, calculated by AA

Figures in the Newcastle Chronicle from AA reveal Newcastle United fans will have to travel 8,198 miles for their away trips this season, costing an estimated £1,077 in petrol.

North-east neighbours Sunderland are a close second, having to clock 145 miles less, while Swansea supporters also suffer, requiring 7,905 miles on the road.

The Swansea vs Newcastle fixture is most problematic for fans, with both sets having to make a 700-mile round trip, while the six London clubs all within 15 miles of each other.

Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion may have had it bad on the pitch last season, but the Midlands sides are luckiest when it comes to hours behind the wheel to follow their club.

Villa prop up the table, having to travel 4,237 at a cost of £556, while Leicester City and the Baggies are in 18th and 19th respectively.

Villa's first trip of the season is the 45-mile journey up the M6 to Stoke, while Newcastle travel to Villa Park for their first travel of the season, a 410-mile round trip for the club's famous support.
