Chaps, thinking of indulging in one last free swimming session before Autumn is well and truly here?

Well, it's not just the forecasted plunge in temperature that might make it a bad idea - a piranha-like fish known for biting and eating testicles may be on its way to Britain.

The Pacu, known as 'The Nut Cracker' and 'The Ball-Cutter', was recently discovered in the Seine river in Paris.

The nightmarish beast is usually found the Amazon, can grow to up to 90cm and grow to 25kg.

On it's way here? The piranha-like Pacu could soon be in the UK

May want to reconsider: This man was pictured in The Thames yesterday. Experts fear the Pacu could soon be found in UK waterways

Fishermen in South America have reportedly bled to death after losing their testicles to the vicious teeth of the fish, a relative of the piranha.

When Pacu turn up in strange places, it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one.

It was found in European waters for the first time in August with experts warning men to keep their trunks on if swimming in the Øresund channel between Denmark and Sweden

Now it has migrated to France, there are fears it could be on its way to the UK's lakes and rivers.

But British men fearing for their manhood take heart - the chillier weather will 
soon ensure that fish like the Pacu could not survive.

Fish expert Henrik Carl told the Local
earlier in August: 'The Pacu is not normally dangerous to people but it
has quite a serious bite. There have been incidents in other countries,
such as Papua New Guinea, where some men have had their testicles 
bitten off.

'They bite because they're hungry, and testicles sit nicely in their mouth.'

A fisherman in Paris called the river 
police when he reeled in the frightening looking fish, which can weigh 
as much as 25 kilos, last Friday morning

'He
sent us an image of the picture through his smart phone and it turned 
out to be a Pacu,' said a police spokesman. 'It is a fish with a very 
dangerous bite!'

The
Pacu is technically a vegetarian,
but tends to be attracted to male genitalia for unknown reasons.

Pacu grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally

When one was found in Denmark last month,
Copenhagen University professor Peter Rask Moller said: 'All we 
suggested was that swimmers keep their pants on until we know if there 
are more of these fish out in our brackish waters.'

'Pacu are commonly kept in aquaria because they are fairly docile, but look like piranhas,' Peter Moyle, a fish biologist, told the Los Angeles Times last month.

'They grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally.'
