Schools will be shut down if they fail to promote British values under plans to root out extremism in the classroom to be unveiled this week.

Education Secretary Michael Gove will announce all pupils must be taught about democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of those of different beliefs.

Schools will also be banned from forcing Muslim girls to wear the veil or sit apart from boys as part of an outlawing of discrimination.

Education Secretary Michael Gove will set out the plans for teaching British values this week

They will be required to challenge parents, teachers or pupils who express support for radical Islamic practices or other forms of extremism.

Overhauled Ofsted inspections will check that schools are meeting the new requirements. Headteachers and governors could be sacked or the school closed if they are found not to be.

Before now, academies and free schools had to show they ‘respect’ the nation’s ‘fundamental’ values, but the new rules, which will apply to all schools, will be strengthened to require the ‘active promotion’ of them.

The new rules, which will come into effect from September, are being introduced in the wake of the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations of a takeover plot in Birmingham schools by hardline Muslims.

Head teachers told Ofsted there was an organised campaign to impose a ‘narrow, faith-based ideology’ at some schools in the city.

It placed five of the city’s schools in special measures after ‘deeply worrying’ findings.

The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in new Oftsed inspections ordered in the wake of concerns about teaching in Birmginham schools

Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils

Reports found music lessons had been removed from the timetable at one school, where Muslim pupils exhibited ‘limited knowledge’ of other religions.

Raffles were banned at one primary school because they were considered ‘un- Islamic’ as they promoted gambling and one academy’s Christmas special assembly was also cancelled.

In addition, inspectors found the terms ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ were used in assemblies.

A consultation will be launched this week setting out the details of the new rules.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Keeping our children safe and ensuring schools prepare them for life in modern Britain could not be more important. This change is an important step towards ensuring we have a strong legal basis for intervening in those schools where this is an issue.

‘The vast majority of schools already promote British values - this is about making sure we have the tools we need to intervene if children are being let down.’
