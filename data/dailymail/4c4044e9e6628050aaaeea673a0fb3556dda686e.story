These are the cigars that the man who founded the Gestapo and gave the order for the Jewish Holocaust puffed on at the height of the Battle of Britain.

Once belonging to Hermann Goering, the cigars and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf went on display at the National Liberation Museum in Groesbeek, Netherlands earlier this week.

Made especially for the Luftwaffe chief, the cigars were taken from him when he was arrested by U.S. troops in Austria in 1945 as he tried to move towards a castle he intended to be his last bolthole.

History: Hermann Goering's cigars and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf have gone on display. An inscription on the box translates as: 'Custom made for the Marshall of the Realm Hermann Goering'

They were purchased after the war - along with a signed copy of Hitler's 
autobiography Mein Kampf - by a Dutch government official who was later charged with trying to have items looted by the Nazis returned to their rightful owners.

The cigars were made by a German company using Sumatra tobacco and were manufactured and presented to Hitler's deputy in August 1941 when the aerial assault that the Nazi leadership saw as the precursor of the occupation of Britain was in full swing.

'Perhaps he smoked them and reflected on the losses incurred on his bomber fleet by the Spitfires and Hurricanes of the RAF,' a National Liberation Museum spokesman said.

'They are an interesting addition to our collection of Nazi regalia,' he added.

Monster: The cigars were custom made for Hermann Goering (pictured). Goering was Adolf Hitler's deputy, the head of the Luftwaffe, and the man who founded the Gestapo and gave the order for the Jewish Holocaust

An inscription on the cigar box translates as: 'Custom made for the Marshall of the Realm Hermann Goering'.

Marshall of the Realm - or Reichsmarschall - was the highest rank in the armed forces of Nazi Germany during the Second World War.

Hermann Goering was the only man ever to hold the rank, with Hitler appointing him Reichsmarschall primarily to make it clear that he was considered senior to other Nazi commanders.

Caught: Hermann Goering was convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg and sentenced to death. He cheated the hangman on 15 October 1946 by taking a cyanide pill that he had concealed in his teeth

The cigars, the signed copy of Mein Kampf and the files of Louis Otto - the man who kept the Nazi memorabilia as souvenirs - were given to the museum by his son earlier this week.

Goering once boasted that soon after his death 'every home in Germany will have a statue of Hermann Goering in it.' But he was convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg and sentenced to death.

He cheated the hangman on 15 October 1946 by taking a cyanide pill that he had concealed in his teeth.Â 

Goering died within minutes, with his body buried in an unmarked grave.
