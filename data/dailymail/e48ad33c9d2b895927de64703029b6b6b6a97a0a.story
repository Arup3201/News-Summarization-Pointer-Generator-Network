One child sex attack was reported every 20 minutes last year, equivalent to 444 attacks a week, according to shocking police figures released today.

About 23,000 children were reported victims in England and Wales during 2010/11 but fewer than 10 per cent of cases ended in a conviction.

There were 4,973 alleged victims aged ten and under, including 1,472 younger than six.

The statistics, obtained by the NSPCC in a freedom of information request, cover rape, incest and child prostitution across all 43 police forces in England and Wales - the figures shown on this map include sex offences against boys and girls in 2011

And six times as many reported offences were committed against girls as against boys.

The statistics, obtained by the NSPCC in a freedom of information request, cover rape, incest and child prostitution across all 43 police forces in England and Wales.

The charity said a major effort was needed to protect children and boost conviction rates.

Shocking: More than a third of all sex crimes are committed against children, figures showed today

A spokesman said: ‘The Government has to start treating the situation as seriously as they would if faced with an outbreak of chronic disease.’

More than a third of all sex crimes 
are committed against children with more than 60 child sex offences 
reported to police every day., figures showed today.

Overall, there were 54,982 sex offences last year, including 23,097 against children, the figures showed.

Most of the children (14,819) were aged between 11 and 17, including 8,749 aged 13 to 15.

Britain's
biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, received the highest number of 
reports (3,420), followed by the forces in Thames Valley (1,264) and 
West Yorkshire (1,170).

Jon 
Brown, head of the NSPCC's sexual abuse programme, said: 'A concentrated
effort has to be made if we are to start reducing this distressing 
level of offences, many of which are committed on extremely young and 
helpless children.

'When you have a situation where more than 60 children are being sexually abused every day, something is very wrong.

'The Government has to start treating the situation as seriously as they would if faced with an outbreak of chronic disease.'

He
went on: 'We also need a clearer picture of what is happening between 
an offence being reported and someone appearing in court.

'The
police are doing their best to bring prosecutions but we need to 
understand why there is such a huge disparity between the two figures.

'It
requires a major effort from Government and the public to give children
the protection they need and to provide more therapeutic programmes so 
the young victims of abuse can start to rebuild their lives.'
