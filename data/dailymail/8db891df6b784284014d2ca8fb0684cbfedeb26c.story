A teacher at an elite boarding school in Princeton, New Jersey, has been arrested by police and charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl who was one of his students.

Nolan A. Johnson, 39, of Morrisville taught theater at the Hun School of Princeton where fees run to $50,000-a-year.

He has been charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child.

Charged: Nolan Johnson, 39, a teacher at The Hun School of Princeton, was arrested and charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child

Hun School officials contacted Princeton Police earlier this month after receiving information about the alleged abuses on the girl.

Nolan allegedly engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with the 16 year-old female victim on multiple occasions between June and July while he was the victim's teacher. 

The incidents apparently occurred both on and off campus.

The charges were a result of an ongoing investigation between Princeton Police detectives and Mercer County Prosecutor's Office detectives.

'We find Mr. Johnson's actions, as described by police, deplorable and we are saddened by their inevitable impact,' Hun Headmaster Jonathan Brougham said in a written statement.

 'Our policies and expectations in this area are clear. And, under no circumstances will we tolerate a violation of the basic trust between teacher and student.

Exclusive: The Hun School of Princeton is a private, coeducational, secondary boarding school located in Princeton, New Jersey with fees of $50,000-a-year

Class dismissed: The former theater teacher was fired as soon as he admitted to police he had an 'inappropriate' relationship with a student of his

Johnson was immediately dismissed after acknowledging to law enforcement officials an inappropriate relationship with a student.

The former theater teacher was placed on leave as soon as we learned of the misconduct and notified the police.

 We have and will continue to assist the authorities in their ongoing investigation. Our first priority is for the privacy and well-being of the student involved. 

We ask that members of the community understand and respect this need.'
