Kieran Read will return for the All Blacks after concussion trouble for Saturday’s third and final Test against England in Hamilton.

Head coach Steve Hansen has thrown the fit-again number eight into the starting line-up, as New Zealand bid to complete a series whitewash against Stuart Lancaster’s side.

Jerome Kaino moves to blindside flanker to accommodate Read - but keeps his place in the starting XV ahead of Liam Messam, who drops to the bench.

Back in the fold: Kieran Read will return for New Zealand for Saturday's final Test

Waiting in the wings: Read watched the last Test from the sidelines

B Smith, C Jane, M Fekitoa, M Nonu, J Savea, A 
Cruden, A Smith, T Woodcock, D Coles, O Franks, B Retallick, S 
Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read. Replacements: K Mealamu, W 
Crockett, C Faumuina, P Tuipulotu, L Messam, TJ Perenara, B Barrett, R 
Crotty.

Malakai Fekitoa wins his first start for the All Blacks, with Conrad Smith ruled out after breaking a thumb in New Zealand’s 28-27 second Test victory last weekend.

The All Blacks will look to equal the record 17 consecutive Test by seeing off England in Hamilton, so Hansen has duly selected from strength.

Highlanders centre Fekitoa is already proving one of the Super Rugby starts of the season, the 22-year-old bolting through the All Blacks ranks in impressive fashion.

Fit-again Read’s global renown was underlined by being crowned International Rugby Board player of the year in 2013.

The 28-year-old was forced to sit out New Zealand’s first two Tests after suffering lingering concussion symptoms.

Now the Crusaders loose-forward will win his 62nd cap this weekend, with captain Richie McCaw completing a fearsome back-row unit to take his 127th All Blacks bow.
