Authorities say a retired Chicago police detective shot and killed his son after mistaking him for a burglar.

According to police, the body of 48-year-old Michael Griffin was found early Wednesday in the father's condominium on Chicago's Northwest Side. He had been shot in the head.

The dead man's brother, Stephen Griffin, said the victim had been watching television with his sleeping father when he went outside. Michael Griffin was shot when he re-entered the apartment.

Tragic: Authorities say a retired Chicago police detective shot and killed his son after mistaking him for a burglar

'My brother was staying there, and last I heard they were watching the Jay Leno Show, and my dad fell asleep,' Stephen Griffin said to CBS. 'And I guess he assumed my brother was at home sleeping, and when someone came in the back door, he just naturally assumed it was an intruder.'

When Michael entered the house, he was shot in the head, police said.

At first, the family did not recognize the victim. Another brother who was staying at the home called Stephen and said 'something happened at dad’s house, that he shot an intruder.'

'At that time he didn’t know who he shot. Then he called me back and told me the bad news,' said Stephen Griffin, whose mother died in 1999, said to the Chicago Tribune.  'I’m just glad my mom wasn’t around to see this.'

He was shocked by the revelation, adding that his 77-year-old father's senses 'aren't as sharp as they used to be.'

James Griffin was a police officer for 42 years serving as a homicide detective on the West Side, Stephen Griffin said. He retired in 1998.

The father had allowed Michael to move in with him after he was having difficulties paying his own rent. The son had just moved in on Tuesday, Stephen Griffin said.

'It has to rip his heart right out of his chest.'

Stephen Griffin had to make the difficult phone call to Michael Griffin's 28-year-old daughter in Tennessee.

'It’s a tragedy,' said Stephen Griffin, 47. 'I’m still in shock.'

Neighbors said the Griffin family was a quiet, police presence in the community.

'It has to rip his heart right out of his chest... it's sad,' neighbor Jim Delaney remarked to Fox.

After the incident, James Griffin was treated for an undisclosed condition. So far, no one has been charged.

This is the second time in as many months a father has accidentally killed his son. Connecticut teen Tyler Giuliano was shot and killed by his father Jeffrey in another case of mistaken identity.
