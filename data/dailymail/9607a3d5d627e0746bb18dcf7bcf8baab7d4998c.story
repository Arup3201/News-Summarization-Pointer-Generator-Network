An ice cream van driver who lost attention 'for a few seconds' killed a motorcyclist after failing to spot him during rush-hour traffic.

Mohammed Zabeur Khan, 49, was making a right turn in his Ford Transit van in Bolton in April this year when he crashed into Andrew Wood, who was travelling in the opposite direction. 

The court heard that Mr Wood, from Bolton, was overtaking 
stationary traffic on his own side of the road when Khan pulled out 
across the traffic.

Khan - who was said to be 'utterly devastated' about what had happened - did not spot Mr Wood’s motorcycle approaching.

The 23-year-old, who worked at an animal 
sanctuary where he cared for sick and abandoned creatures, died in 
hospital from his injuries. 

In a statement released by police, Mr 
Wood's family said he had been a 'hard-working, honest and friendly 
person' and they were 'completely overcome' by his death.

During the hearing at Bolton Crown Court, Khan pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving.

The court heard that Khan - who needed an interpreter in the proceedings - had momentarily lost attention.

Mr Wood had been 
travelling in the opposite direction in his own lane and on the outside 
of queuing traffic, the court was told.

Mohammed Nawaz, representing Khan, said the collision had been 'no more than a few seconds of momentarily in-attention'.

He said: 'He was on a main road in Bolton, in rush hour traffic. He was wanting to execute a right turn, he positioned himself in the centre of the road and indicated to turn right.

The crash, which took place in Bolton, pictured above, during rush-hour traffic, took place after Khan momentarily lost attention. Mr Wood died later in hospital from his injuries

'He waited for a gap in the traffic. Once a gap appeared he began his right turn.'

He added that the defendant accepted that carelessness had led to the crash, but that he had been left shattered by the outcome. 

He said: 'He (Khan) is a man almost in
 his 50s, he drives for a living. He was driving an ice cream van at the
 time. He has a clean record and no previous convictions.

'He is a family
 man with children. He is utterly devastated by the consequences of the 
collision.'

Prosecutor Peter Cadwallder said: 'Clearly in-attention was only for a 
few seconds but in light of tragic circumstances I would put it in 
category two although not at the top of that.'

Khan pleaded guilty at Bolton Crown Court, pictured above, to causing death by careless driving and was told it was unlikely he would be sent to prison for the crime

Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant would be unlikely to go to jail for the killing.

He said: 'Momentarily in-attention means exactly what it says. The case doesn’t easily fit in. It seems to me that it is placed at the bottom end of the second category.

'This case, if the defendant pleads guilty will not attract a prison sentence.'

The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports. Khan will be sentenced in September at the court.

He was issued with an interim driving ban ahead of sentencing.

In a statement released by police, Mr Wood’s family said: 'Andrew was a dedicated son, brother and uncle and will be sorely missed by his close circle of friends.

'He was a hard-working, honest and friendly person who enjoyed walking with his dog and riding his motorcycle.

'He worked with sick, injured and abandoned animals at a local animal rescue centre. He had a lovely girlfriend and they had plans to move into their first home together in the near future.

'We are all completely overcome by his loss and our lives will feel empty without him.'
