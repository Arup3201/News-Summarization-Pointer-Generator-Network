A Texas man with a lengthy criminal record has been indicted on murder charges for allegedly killing his wife's newborn daughter - whom law enforcement officials say he resented because the little girl wasn't his - in July of 2013.

Brian Christopher Keith, 29, had just been released from prison for an arson conviction nine days before he allegedly murdered 4-week-old Nevaeh Keith.

After he was released from prison, Keith moved in with his wife, Shanna Keith and little Nevaeh, in their home in a Houston suburb.

'Killer': Brian Keith resented the fact that his wife's newborn belonged to another man, authorities say

According to authorities, On July 2, 2013, Keith was heading to work at about 4 a.m. when he heard the baby crying in her crib as his wife slept.

Keith later told authorities that before he left for work he remembers 'patting the child on the head and maybe striking the baby.'

Later that morning, at about 11 a.m., Child Protective Services agents stopped by the Keiths' home to bring Shanna Keith to a treatment facility.

When the CPS agents got to the home, they discovered that Nevaeh was unresponsive and immediately called 9-1-1.

The little girl was taken to a local hospital where she later was pronounced dead.Â 

An autopsy showed that Nevaeh was killed by 'compression death, which essentially is any form of blunt-force trauma to the body.

Keith, authorities contend, resented the baby because she wasn't his, which may have been a motive for the killing.

Only a few days after the baby's death, Keith was arrested for a road rage incident and thrown in the county jail on assault charges, according to KHOU.

Keith was released on probation, which he soon violated and was sent back to jail where he remains.

As Keith was sitting in jail for violating his probation, a grand jury was deciding whether to indict him for the murder of Nevaeh.

On Friday, Keith was served with a murder indictment while still behind bars in the Liberty County Jail.

No bond has been set.

Since 2005, Keith has been accused with more than 23 criminal offenses, including assault, arson and now murder.
