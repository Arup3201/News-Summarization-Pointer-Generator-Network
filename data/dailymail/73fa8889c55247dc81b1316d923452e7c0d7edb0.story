A pair of young female lovers writhing in pleasure as they embrace. A married, older couple entwined in each others arms. A courtesan, her neck exposed, the flash of crimson at her collar hinting at pleasures to come.

This is Shunga or 'spring pictures', an astonishingly explicit genre of Japanese art that is the subject of a new exhibition at the British Museum.

But though it sounds like pornography at first hearing, the reality of shunga is far from crude modern depictions of sex.

Most of the images, although explicit, are loving - even tender - and show the pleasure being shared out between men and women in equal measure.

Nevertheless, it certainly doesn't pull any punches. So frank are the 170 artworks on display, the museum has insisted on a no unaccompanied under-16's rule.

There are young people and old, gay and straight couplings, clothed and unclothed, and images that hint at sex, while others offer a ringside seat.

Many focus on middle-class married couples with their stories delicately inked in alongside as well as exhortations to go faster or slow down from the ladies pictured.

Particularly stunning is Torii Kiyonaga's 1785 Sode no maki (Handscroll for the Sleeve), where the finely drawn scene offers an intimate glimpse into the bedroom of an ageing couple, her hair elaborately drawn up with gold pins, his receding rapidly.

But not everything is so familiar.  Hokusai's 1814 Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, shows a dreaming woman wrapped in the erotic embrace of an octopus.

And while most shunga do focus on ordinary Japanese people, the odd Dutch or Portuguese adventurer sometimes creeps in.

Although most of the works on display at the British Museum date from between 1600 and 1900, shunga's roots go back much further and to China.

Among the first artists to create what would become known as shunga was T'ang Dynasty erotic painter, Zhou Fang, whose paintings, created between 730 to 800 AD, depicted courtiers in various states of undress and with unusually large genitalia.

In Japan itself, the earliest works can be traced to the contemporary Heian period, although it didn't become widely popular until much later.

By 1600, shunga was being produced by the Ukiyo-e school (‘pictures of the floating world’), which included some of the greatest Japanese masters including Hishikawa Moronobu, Kitagawa Utamaro and Katsushika Hokusai.

Despite widespread acceptance, shunga was banned by the Japanese government in 1722, although censorship barely dented in its popularity.

Shunga finally fell out of favour in the late 19th and early 20th century, when the advent of erotic photography left it unable to compete.

Now, with porn and boob-heavy lad's mags everywhere you look, shunga appears an oddly gentle way of portraying sex and love - octopuses notwithstanding.

Shunga: Sex and Pleasure in Japanese Art runs from 3rd October until 5th January 2014 at the British Museum. See britishmuseum.org for more information.
