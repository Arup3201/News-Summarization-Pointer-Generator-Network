The U.S. soccer team's career scoring leader Landon Donovan was among seven players cut Thursday as the United States announced its 23-man World Cup roster.

The 32-year-old attacker, bidding to make his fourth World Cup, was bypassed by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann in favor of newcomers Aron Johannsson and Chris Wondolowski, who joined mainstays Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey as the forwards.

The shock announcement came well before the June 2 deadline set by FIFA in advance of this year's World Cup in Brazil - which starts next month.

Also cut were defenders Brad Evans, Clarence Goodson and Michael Parkhurst, midfielders Joe Corona and Maurice Edu, and forward Terrence Boyd - but Donovan's name is the one that stands out.

Donovan has 57 goals in 156 international appearances and has been the face of American soccer for the past decade, both with the national team and with Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, where he has won five titles.

The most famous goal, his signature moment, was the stoppage time thriller in the 91st minute to give the U.S. a 1-0 win over Algeria in the 2010 World Cup to sent the Americans to the elimination round.

'It has been an honor and privilege to have represented the US National Team in three World Cups,' Donovan said in a statement posted to Facebook.

'I was looking forward to playing in Brazil and, as you can imagine, I am very disappointed with today’s decision,' he continued.

'Regardless, I will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer, and I remain committed to helping grow soccer in the US in the years to come

Donovan was the star of the national team before he took a sabbatical of about four months after the 2012 season, spending part of the time in Cambodia. Klinsmann said upon Donovan's return last year that he would have to earn his spot back - but few thought he would not make the trip to Brazil.

He restored Donovan to the roster for last summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup, where Donovan excelled, and played Donovan for World Cup qualifiers later in the year.

But Klinsmann kept him out of the starting lineup for last month's exhibition against Mexico, saying Donovan practiced poorly because of a knee problem.

Donovan insisted this week his knee was OK, but Klinsmann clearly did not like what he saw from the attacking midfielder. Still, he did not take the cut lightly.

'This is certainly one of the toughest decisions…the toughest decision in my coaching career,' Klinsmann told ESPN.

'I'm very confident in my abilities and I think I'm deserving to be a part of the squad, but I have to prove that and I have to earn it,' he said Monday.

When Klinsmann announced his 30-man preliminary roster on May 12, he said he viewed Donovan more a forward than a midfielder.

'I don't have that youthful energy and excitement that I did in 2002, but I see the game and I see the situation a lot more clearly now, so I'm able to I think enjoy it more in that way,' Donovan said.

'When you're younger, you're just sort of going crazy to do whatever it takes to make the team and you forget to enjoy it, And now I'm actually getting to enjoy it.'

Reaction among most fans at the news of Donovan being left off the team was a mixture of outrage, shock and sadness.

'Donovan not making the US roster doesn't feel right,' New York Red Bulls striker Ryan Meara tweeted.

'Landon Donovan was not my favorite teammate in the world. With that said, this is a HUGE mistake to leave him off the World Cup team,' tweeted former MLS player Alecko Eskandarian.
