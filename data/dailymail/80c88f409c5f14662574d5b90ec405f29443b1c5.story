BBC political editor Nick Robinson is fighting a rare form of cancer, it emerged last night.

The 51-year-old has been diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid tumour and will undergo lifesaving surgery to have it removed.

Located in the lungs’ larger tubes, they are usually slow-growing. But they can spread and trigger cancer elsewhere in the body, becoming fatal.

In a statement, Mr Robinson’s agent said the broadcaster would be ‘taking a short time off work over the next few weeks’.

‘His doctors are aiming to get him back at work in plenty of time to cover the Election campaign proper,’ she added.

‘He and his family have asked that they now have the space and privacy he needs in order to rest and recover fully before returning to work.’

Prime Minister David Cameron sent Mr Robinson a message of goodwill, tweeting: ‘Sorry to hear you’ll be off for a few weeks. I wish you well – and a speedy return before the General Election.’

And a BBC spokesman said: ‘Everyone at the BBC wishes Nick a speedy recovery.’

Last night Mr Robinson tweeted: ‘Thank you for the many kind and generous messages. Here’s hoping to be back reporting the news soon.’

Bronchial carcinoid tumours are different from ‘normal’ lung cancer, which forms among the cells that line the lung. Carcinoid tumours are actually cancers of tissues that produce hormones and send messages, called the neuroendocrine system.

They can occur in numerous organs. Two-thirds appear in the digestive tract, a quarter in the lungs, and others in the pancreas, kidney, ovary and testes, according to Cancer Research UK.

Dr Keith Prowse, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, said while bronchial carcinoid tumours were malignant, they tended to be less aggressive than other forms.

He said: ‘I’ve had ten or a dozen patients who have had it removed successfully and are still around, some of them older than I am. The majority are cured by surgery.

‘It’s often possible to remove the tumours completely, because they tend to grow inside the air passage rather than into the lung.’

About 70 per cent of patients live at least five years after being diagnosed, he added. But he said if they did spread, they tended to be fairly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Most people with bronchial carcinoid tumours are diagnosed after the age of 60, although they can have existed for years without any symptoms.

Mr Robinson has been the Corporation’s political editor since 2005, when he was poached from ITN.

His illness follows that of his BBC predecessor, Andrew Marr, who suffered a stroke in January 2013 at the age of 53.

After lengthy rehabilitation Mr Marr has made a good recovery.
