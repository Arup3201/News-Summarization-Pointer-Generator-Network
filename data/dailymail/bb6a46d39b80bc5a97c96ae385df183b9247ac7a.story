A leading American cardinal has slammed the Pope for destabilising Roman Catholicism, leaving congregations feeling 'betrayed'.

Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke said the Church is 'a ship without a rudder' leaving believers 'feeling a bit seasick'.

His words come after a Vatican conference proposed relaxing their approach towards homosexuality.

Angry: Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke condemned Pope Francis for 'confusing' the faithful

He said: 'Many have expressed their concerns to me. At this very critical moment, there is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder.

'They are feeling a bit seasick because they feel the church’s ship has lost its way.'

The conference, which convenes every two years, discusses the Church's approach to family dynamics.

A preliminary report released from the confidential meeting revealed a proposal to sideline the 'all or nothing' attitude currently held by Catholics in respect of 'irregular' set-ups such as unmarried parents. 

Shocking: The pontiff sent shock waves through the Church by kissing a severely deformed man

'Liberal approach': He has been condemned by hard-line Catholics for being too relaxed on social issues

It added that there are 'positive elements' in gay relationships that have 'gifts and qualities' the Church should not reject.

Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput also raised concerns with the pope's comments, saying of homosexuality: 'None of us are welcomed on our own terms in the church. We are welcomed on Jesus' terms. That's what it means to be a Christian. You submit yourself to Jesus and his teaching. You don't re-create your own body of spirituality.'

The report has been seen as one of many moves by the papacy to negotiate new perspectives on social issues that had until now been sidelined - such as abortion, divorce and contraception.

The pontiff sent shock waves through the Church when he washed two women's feet in a local prison on Holy Thursday last year.

Compassion: He demonstrated compassion by washing the feet of a woman and a man with boils last year 

Unconventional: Instead of the SUV that Benedict preferred, this vintage Renault is Francis' ride of choice

This year, he kept up his reputation for controversy by washing the feet of 12 disabled people of various ages, ethnicities and religious confessions.

It came after he halted his papal audience to kiss and hold and man with elephantitis in November 2013.

He also declared that Darwin's theory of evolution does not contradict the belief that God created the universe.

And when asked about gay marriage, he said: 'Who am I to judge?'
