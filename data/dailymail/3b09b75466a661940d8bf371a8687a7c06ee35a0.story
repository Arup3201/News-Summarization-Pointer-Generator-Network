Hundreds of families have signed up to join a new community dubbed the Citadel, an armed and 'defensible' fortress city where their freedoms and liberty will be fiercely protected.

Organisers have outlined plans for a community of 3,500 to 7,000 families of 'patriotic' Americans in western Idaho and more than 200 have already signed up through their website.

The group has already purchased 20 acres in the area where they intend to build an arms factory which will be used to fund the project.

Fortress: Plans for the Citadel include two perimeter walls with 18 watchtowers and further 
walled sections for residential areas

A plan for the fortress shown on theÂ website includes a perimeter wall complete with 18 look-out towers, a firearms museum, a reflecting pool, a school and an amphitheatre.

Inside the individual neighborhood areas will each have lower walls dividing the town into defensible sections.

The community will live in accordance 
with Thomas Jefferson's ideal of rightful liberty which is described as 
'neighbors keep their noses out of other neighbors' business, that 
neighbors live and let live.'

The bizarre plan emerged as sales of firearms have soared amid growing demands for tougher gun laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre in December.

A warning on the homepage reads: 'Marxists, Socialists, Liberals and Establishment Republicans will likely find that life in our community is incompatible with their existing ideology and preferred lifestyles.'

According to the Citadel website states that residents will bound by the following principles:

Anyone planning on joining the Citadel community is expected to be proficient with a rifle and to be 'prepared for the emergencies of life'.

In return the Citadel will offer a safe, well-prepared, patriotic community where children will be educated in school, not indoctrinated.

Site: The proposed location for the Citadel is in Benwah County, Idaho where the group have already purchased 20 acres

The website carries an advert to an associated gun retailer which urges visitors to 'buy an AR before it's too late' - referring to military-type assault rifles as used by gunman Adam Lanza during the Sandy Hook massacre.

Following the shootings at the elementary school in New Town, Connecticut are underway to make the sale of such weapons illegal, which is seen by some groups as an attack on their liberties.

The Citadel website says that people selected to live in the community 'will voluntarily agree to follow the footsteps of our Founding Fathers by swearing to one another our lives, our fortunes and our Sacred Honor to defend one another and Liberty against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'
