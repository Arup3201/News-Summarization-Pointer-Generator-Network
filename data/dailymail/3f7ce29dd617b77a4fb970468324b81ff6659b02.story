A Spanish restaurant has been accused of taking advantage of female staff by forcing them to serve customers in their underwear.

The Eric II restaurant in the town of Tarragona, in the east Spanish province of Catalonia, said they had found business was booming since waitresses had been ordered to strip down to their underwear to serve breakfast to guests.

But after the restaurant was featured on local television the business is now facing an investigation following a complaint by women's rights activists from the Reus L'Violet Hour (Reus L'Hora Violeta) organisation who reported the restaurant to police.

A spokesman for the organisation said it was taking advantage of the economic situation and the fact that many of the waitresses knew that if they refused to agree they might lose their jobs.

However, owner Loli Carrillo said it was precisely because of the economic crisis that she was encouraging staff to be more inventive with the way customers were served.

She also claimed the underwear was only worn on certain days of the week and that on other days other costumes were worn.

For example she said that on one day the girls had been asked to dress up as bees.

She said: 'I don't see a problem with what we do here and I certainly don't see it as being on a par with something like the American bar chain that has topless women.

'We had an inspection last week and there were no problems as far as the labour inspectors were concerned. In fact they saw that there were also women in here who are customers and I don't even have a problem when my children are here.'

She said she and her brother had decided it was the only way to ensure the restaurant's future, and the jobs for the staff adding: 'As far as I'm concerned it's a family business, and it is not sexist to do what we have done.'
