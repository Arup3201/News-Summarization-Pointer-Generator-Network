The father of Chelsea captain John Terry has told how his son was a ‘tower of strength’ who had 'been through it as well' after being cleared of a race-hate charge in his latest brush with the law.

Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette.

Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict – which came less than two years after his professional footballer son was also cleared of racial abuse.

Edward 'Ted' Terry said he was 'relieved' after being cleared of racially-aggravated assault at the Old Bailey in Central London yesterday

England captain John Terry talks to the media during a press conference. He has supported his father throughout the trial this week and was accused of racial abuse in 2011

John Terry had been accused of hurling racial abuse at Queens Park ranger player Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in 2011.

He was cleared of the charge by Westminster Magistrates' Court but was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association.

It means both the father and son have now won court cases where they’ve been accused of racially-aggravated offences.

On the steps of the Old Bailey, he told reporters yesterday: ‘I'm just going home and I'm going to phone John up.

'It's been a hard year for all of us. We all felt it was nothing, really. It was stupid.’

Speaking to The Sun, Mr Terry also told how his England footballer son had supported him throughout the trial.

He said: ‘It has been a tough time for him as well. But he just kept saying to me, “You will be alright, Dad. You'll be OK”.

‘He's been a tower of strength and he has been through it as well. I worried he felt a bit responsible as Mr Talafair admitted in court he went to the police after being told who I was.

‘I feel very relieved.’

A jury of seven men and five women took an hour and 20 minutes to find self-employed decorator Terry not guilty of one count of racially-aggravated common assault after a five-day trial.

Terry, from Grays in Essex, was also cleared of one count of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

His colleagues, Stephen Niland, 36, and Moldova-born Tudor Musteata, 47, were also found not guilty of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

Mr Talafair said that he had suffered no injury from Terry's alleged headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time and admitted calling the defendant a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off.

Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying "f****** P***, let's have it right here and now'.

The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'f*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.'

The confrontation started after a dispute over a cigarette outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station in London.

The jury of seven men and five women also heard that the Chelsea captain's father received a 24-month conditional discharge for common assault in 2005 and a suspended prison sentence for an offence of supplying class A drugs in 2010.

Two months after being arrested for racially aggravated assault in March last year, Terry admitted racially abusing another man.

He was fined £200 for saying 'f****** Irish p****' during an argument at Barking rail station, the court heard.

Ted Terry's appearance today at the Old Bailey, where he was acquitted of a racist attack, is the latest in a string of scandals to strike the Terry family over the years.In 2010 Terry was given a suspended prison sentence and 100 hours' community service after he admitted supplying drugs.He had been caught on camera handing over three wraps of cocaine for £120 by an undercover reporter in a bar in Essex.He told the reporter, who posed as a chauffeur buying the drugs for his wealthy boss: 'The stuff 's all right. I get off on it.'He added: 'This is just between me and you. Don't tell him that I'm John Terry's dad.'John Terry's mother Sue has also run into trouble with the law. In 2009 she was caught shoplifting £800 of shopping from Tesco and Marks & Spencer.She was arrested along with the footballer's mother-in-law Sue Poole after shop attendants noticed them walking out of a store in Weybridge, Surrey, with a shopping trolley filled with shoes, clothes and even pet food.Terry and Poole accepted a caution from officers after being caught, which would have been put on both women's criminal records.A police spokesman said at the time: 'Cautions are usually applied for more minor matters or when it is a first time offence. A caution represents an admission of guilt and forms part of a criminal record.'John Terry has also found himself in court on race charges. He was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers on the football pitch in October 2011.Prosecutors said Terry swore and used the word 'black' of Mr Ferdinand. He was cleared of the charge, but a later hearing by the Football Association still imposed a £220,000 fine and a four-match ban.Their verdict said that Terry had been found guilty of 'using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race.'In 2010 he was also exposed by the Daily Mail for touting his personal box at Wembley Stadium for £4,000 a match.The terms of the perk, which he received as then England football captain, specifically forbade Terry from hiring the box out, but an undercover reporter was offered use of it by one of Terry's go-betweens.Shortly after the revelations, coupled with an ongoing controversy about attempts to cover up an extra-martial affair, he was sacked as England captain by Fabio Capello.
