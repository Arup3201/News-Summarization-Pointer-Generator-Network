Harrogate, who found him hanged at home.

A 12-year-old schoolboy has hanged himself at home.

Art-loving Jordan Green was found by his mum Heidi in an upstairs room.

Yesterday tributes were paid by classmates of Jordan. They left flowers and a lit candle in a lantern outside his stone-built mid-terrace home in Duncan Street, Harrogate, North Yorks.

Mobile hairdresser Heidi, 36, discovered Jordan's body at 9.20am Wednesday.

Paramedics and police were called but Jordan was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Harrogate High School pupil was checked on by mum after he'd failed to leave for classes.

Her next door neighbour said: 'My partner was in the bath upstairs and heard Heidi let out a terrible scream.

'Then there was lots of noise and then the ambulance and police turned up.'

Jordan, who also loved horses, was an only child and his father lives elsewhere in Harrogate.

'Jordan was a sweet lad and it is awful to think of him hanging himself. I know he had some problems.'

Classmates have set up Facebook pages in Jordan's memory. Emily

would nag me to get out of bed to come in the pool with you because we 
didn't know anybody else :') and then we would walk to the shop and buy 
cat biscuits and feed them all on our porch bit, (Smokey was mine and 
Jessie was yours) they were so cute and we wanted to bring them home in 
the suitcase with us! I will miss you!xxxxx'

 Hindsleey left a message saying: 'Jordan, I remember seeing your happy 
little bubbly face outside your house, coming round to mine always 
saying 'alright kayley' in a proper Yorkshire accent...'

Miss Hinsleey said Jordan was 'always saying hello' to people in the street and recalls how he had a 'little den' at the back of his street.

She goes on to recall how Jordan used to enjoy playing football and 'always knew how to put a smile on peoples faces'.

On Sunday friends are going to release Chinese lanterns from The Stray - park and grassland in the heart of Harrogate - at 8pm.

Andrew Bayston, head teacher at Harrogate High School, said a special tribute room had been set up at the school in memory of Jordan, and counselling was being provided to pupils saddened by the loss of their classmate.

Mr Bayston said: 'The school was deeply shocked and saddened to hear the news yesterday of Jordan's death at his home. Jordan was a lively Year 7 student who had a particular passion and talent for art.

'The school is providing counselling for students and staff during this very difficult time. We have also arranged a special 'tribute room' where students can leave messages, flowers and mementos and spend some quiet time reflecting upon this sad loss.

'Our thoughts and sympathies go out to Jordan's family.'

North Yorkshire Police have launched an investigation into Jordan's death.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'The death is not being treated as suspicious and no-one else is being sought in connection with the incident.

'Police officers are working with the family to provide support at this very difficult time. A file will be prepared on behalf of the coroner.'
