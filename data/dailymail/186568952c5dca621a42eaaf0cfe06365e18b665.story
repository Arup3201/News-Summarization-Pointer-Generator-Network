A government agency in Chile has published a report on two photographs showing an object which it claims 'can be qualified as a UFO.'

The Committee for the Studies of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena (CEFAA), part of Chile's Ministerial Department of Civil Aeronautics, studied photographs of the object after it was spotted by four engineers above a remote copper mine.

According to the report, the engineers described the object as 'a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [16 to 32 feet]. It performed ascending, descending and horizontal movements in short lengths, about 600 meters above the ground.'

The Commitee for the Studies of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena (CEFAA) studied the photographs of an object spotted by four engineers above a remote copper mine

Following investigations, the CEFAA ruled out the possibility of any meteorological phenomena, including lenticular clouds, along with experimental aircraft, planes, and weather balloons

One of the workers reportedly took the pictures on a Kenox Samsung S860 camera after they spotted the object at the Collahuasi copper mine while they were working there in April 2013.

While the engineers did not want to talk about the sighting, the photographer did tell a colleague at the mine, who sent copies of the images to the CEFAA earlier this year.

The engineer who sent the pictures on to the government agency also passed on information provided to him by the witnesses, the Huffington Post has reported.

Following investigations, the CEFAA ruled out the possibility of any meteorological phenomena, including lenticular clouds, along with experimental aircraft, planes, and weather balloons, according to the Inquisitr.

The agency also ruled out the possibility of drones in the area.

CEFAA international affairs director Jose Lay told Leslie Kean, for the Huffington Post: 'Fishing companies use drones and they make a lot of noise. This was definitely not a drone.'

According to the report, the engineers described the object as 'a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [16 to 32 feet]'

The study concludes: 'It is an object or phenomenon of great interest, and it can be qualified as a UFO.'

Caution has been urged however 
regarding the conclusions, primarily as the four engineers who witnessed
 the incident refused to co-operate with the agency conducting the 
investigation.

The report 
was released in the same week as the CIA revealed they were responsible 
for a number of 'UFO' sightings in Norway in the 1950s.

Throughout
 the decade, numerous lights in the sky were reported by members of the 
public and pilots alike, with some suggesting they were of 
extraterrestrial origin.

But the CIA last week revealed it was the agency flying their secretive U-2 aircraft high in the atmosphere.

In a tweet the CIA said: ‘Remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ‘50s? That was us.’

Meanwhile, a series of images from Nasa's Curiosity rover, which shows a white dot appearing to descend to the surface of Mars, was also explained this week.

While one Youtuber claimed the images was evidence of a UFO landing on the red planet, Nasa said the anomaly can be easily explained as a so-called 'hot pixel' in one of the cameras.
