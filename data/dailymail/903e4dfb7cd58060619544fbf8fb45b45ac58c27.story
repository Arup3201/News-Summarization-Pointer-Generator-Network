For hospital patients, the nights are often the loneliest, bleakest time. For Caroline Attrill, the night after surgeons found a worrying ‘abnormality’ was possibly the worst of her life.

Caroline, then 25 and a mother of two, had undergone routine surgery to repair a prolapsed womb — but during the operation, surgeons had spotted a growth near her bladder that needed to be removed as soon as possible. It was frightening news.

‘I’d gone into hospital to have a routine op and now there was this “abnormality” — I was petrified it was cancer,’ recalls Caroline.

Her anxiety was understandable — over the previous ten years the receptionist from Southampton had suffered more than 300 kidney infections, with no obvious cause.

Despite her anguish, ‘not a single nurse or doctor came to see me that night to explain what was going on’, says Caroline.

‘My husband, Mark, had left because visiting hours were over and I just felt so scared and alone. I spent the night crying my eyes out — I even phoned my mum at 3am, begging her to come and get me. She rang the nurses’ station and that was the only time a nurse came to see me.

‘I was really distressed, yet the nurse basically told me off and almost pushed me back to bed.’The next morning a young nurse starting her shift caught sight of a clearly distraught Caroline. ‘She appeared by my bed like some kind of angel,’ she recalls.

‘She was just so comforting, asking me what was wrong, and reassuring me she would sort everything out. She hadn’t even taken off her coat, but started looking over my notes and explained what had happened during the operation. She also arranged for the surgeon to come and see me.

‘And, despite having other patients to see to, this nurse was by my bed, on and off, for ages — even through her lunch break. She made me believe everything would be all right.’

The nurse was Gemma Pearson. Over the next ten months, Caroline was admitted to hospital nearly 20 times, but the dedicated care she received from 24-year-old Gemma helped her through this.

That’s why Caroline is nominating Gemma for the Daily Mail Health Hero awards.

‘It’s not just her empathy that makes Gemma stand out,’ says Caroline. ‘She goes out of her way to care, anticipating what you might want, how you might feel.

‘She’d come to check on you just to see how you were. The other nurses did the medical things, but didn’t really speak to us; she did both. When she was on the ward, everyone cheered up and felt better.

‘I was the youngest patient by far, and with the older patients, Gemma would make sure they’d eaten properly, cutting their food up for them, or feeding them, to keep their strength up.

‘She’d search out fortified drinks for those who couldn’t eat, bringing back a selection of flavours, rather than just making them have what she’d chosen. She’d find chairs for relatives to sit on.

'It's not just her empathy that makes Gemma (pictured left) stand out,' says Caroline (right). 'She goes out of her way to care, anticipating what you might want, how you might feel.'

'I just do what I can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through. That's what we have to do as nurses' explains Gemma (pictured)

‘She would also stay after her shift had finished to make sure her patients were OK. She even came in on her day off to check on me. She made such a difference.

‘Before I met Gemma, my faith in the NHS was non-existent — she restored it.’

Two days after her operation, Caroline was discharged from the Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton, facing the prospect of another operation to investigate and remove the ‘abnormality’ once she’d recovered properly. Adding to her worries was the news that the catheter which had been inserted to drain urine from her bladder would have to remain for the foreseeable future.

‘I was already anxious about my next operation, and now I felt so humiliated that I was going to be hooked indefinitely to a bag — I was only 25.’

It was Gemma who was there to comfort her and explain.

Two days later, on Christmas Eve, Caroline was rushed back into hospital in agonising pain, caused by a blockage in the catheter. She spent Christmas Day not at home with her husband and their two sons, Alexander, now five, and Benjamin, four, but in hospital. ‘Even though I felt so ill, I was miserable about not being at home. But Gemma spent as much time with me as she could.

‘And when the children were allowed a brief visit, she made balloon animals out of surgical gloves, drew pictures on napkins and played games with the cardboard sick bowls. She tried so hard to make us all feel better.’

Caroline returned to hospital last February to have investigative surgery — this revealed that her ‘abnormality’ was actually a 5cm cyst. That was the good news.

‘When I woke up from the operation, I was racked with pain,’ she says. ‘But what made things worse was I’d been led to believe the growth had been the cause of all my problems and I wouldn’t need a catheter any more.

‘But it was still there and I was told it might have to stay for good because of the damage to  my urethra.

‘I felt utterly wretched. But as soon as I got back to the ward, Gemma was there, reassuring me, talking me through everything.’

Caroline had to undergo two more investigative operations, and each time, she says, she was overwhelmed by Gemma’s unstinting care and devotion.

‘Once she came to see me on the day she was off work and going on holiday, saying she just wanted me to know that she was always there for me,’ Caroline says. Matron Carol Gosling, who works alongside Gemma at the Princess Anne Hospital, says her colleague ‘deserves both the plaudits and the nomination of health hero’.

‘Gemma goes above and beyond to make sure her patients always come first. Many times I’ve seen her work through her break or stay late because she wants to make sure she can personally see that everything is done for a particular patient,’ she adds.

‘There are a lot of good nurses, but Gemma nurses as much with her heart as with the practical skills and knowledge she has learned. She’s an exceptional nurse and a credit to the profession.’

Gemma says: ‘Nursing is easy because it’s something I feel so passionately about.’ She puts it down to the death of her 14-year-old cousin in a motorbike accident when she herself was a teenager.

‘I spent a lot of time with my aunt, his mother. I saw how she struggled to come to terms with what had happened, and I felt I needed to do something with my life to help other people when they were having such difficulties.’

‘I just do what I can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through. That’s what we have to do as nurses.’

Moved by her example, in January Caroline quit her job as a receptionist at a gym to work with elderly and vulnerable people.

‘I was so inspired by watching the way Gemma cared for others and the difference she made,’ explains Caroline, now 26.

‘I wanted to be able to do for others what she had done for me. Everything I do in my new job — whether it’s explaining things carefully to frightened elderly people or giving what comfort I can — is down to watching Gemma at work.

‘Gemma’s an exceptional person who genuinely cares about your health. And she’s helped me deal with whatever my fate may be. She’s unique.’
