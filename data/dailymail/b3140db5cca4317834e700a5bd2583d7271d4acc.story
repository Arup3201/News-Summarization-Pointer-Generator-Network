Manchester United have been warned they may have to break the world record fee for a defender after enquiring about Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos.

United stumbled through a 0-0 draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday which left more questions about the strength of their squad and their defence continues to look fragile.

They have sounded out the French champions ahead of a possible summer move for the stylish Marquinhos.

The 20-year-old is under contract until 2018, but Manchester United are said to be interested in him

Manager Louis van Gaal has drawn up a list of potential targets and the Brazilian is among those names, however, they have been warned the defender won't come cheap.

The 20-year-old central defender joined PSG 18 months ago from Roma in a £23.4million deal but has found himself playing at right-back to accommodate the arrival of David Luiz this season.

United value Marquinhos at around £30million but PSG have laughed off those figures and United would have to supass the £50m fee PSG paid to Chelsea for Luiz to get him.

His agent Giuliano Bertolucci said: 'Last summer, PSG's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that Marquinhos was unsellable. We will see what their position is this summer. Many clubs are interested in the player. Manchester United are one of them, this is true.'

Marquinhos appeals to Van Gaal as he can play in a four or three-man defensive line and is comfortable in possession.

United predictably are being quoted huge sums for their defensive targets as they weigh up options for the summer. 

Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin would be £28.5million, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels will command £30m and Nicolas Otamendi at Valencia has also been discussed but the Spanish side want his buy-out figure of £37m.

The fact Marquinhos has been moved aside to allow compatriots Luiz and Thiago Silva to form PSG's central defensive partnership has encouraged United they could persuade the player to move.

Under-fire Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is keen to land a new defender in January 

Talking to Le Parisien, Bertolucci added: 'Marquinhos wants to become the best defender in the world. He is not a lesser player compared with Thiago Silva or David Luiz.

'He respects the decisions of his coach, but just wants to play and spend as little time as possible on the bench. Marquinhos is prepared to play at right-back and even in defensive midfield if he has to.'

Marquinhos has made 47 first-team appearances for PSG since joining the club from Roma in July 2013.

United, meanwhile, have yet to agree new contracts with young defenders Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett with both players free to talk to foreign clubs.
