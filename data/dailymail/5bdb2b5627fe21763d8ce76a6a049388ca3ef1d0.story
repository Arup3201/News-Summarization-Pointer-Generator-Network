The grandmother of a 13-year-old girl at the center of a battle to turn off her life-support machine said she is devastated because the last words spoken to the terrified teenager were hers, saying everything would be OK.

Sandra Chatman, a nurse, said she held Jahi McMath’s hand as she suffered complications following a routine tonsil operation and reassured her that the doctors knew what they were doing.

But just minutes later Jahi’s heart stopped and caused so much brain damage that those same doctors now want to turn off the ventilator that keeps her alive.

Mrs Chatman, who works at a different hospital to where her granddaughter is being treated, said that the memory had left her distraught and destroyed the trust she had in the medical profession.

'She was so frightened,' a visibly moved Mrs Chatman said from her home just a few miles from where Jahi remained in intensive care at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California.

'I was with her [when] the complications began, when the blood started to come out of her mouth. I was the one holding her hand and reassuring her that everything was going to be OK.'

'She said ‘'Grandma this hurt so bad" and I said everything would work out and it hasn’t.

'That is the devastating part. I feel so bad because Jahi was so scared. I feel so bad because I think Jahi, the sweetest girl in the world, suffered so badly.'

Mrs Chatman, 50, a grandmother-of-four, said that when the complications began she told the nurse to get a doctor, but claimed that no one took her seriously enough.

She said that it was only when she noticed that Jahi’s vital signs were slipping away and she shouted across the intensive care unit that any proper action was taken.

By then it was too late for a crash team to resuscitate her in time to stop devastating brain damage – damage so severe that the hospital wants to turn off her life support machine because it claims there is no chance of her recovering.

Mrs Chatman, who along with Jahi’s other relatives are fighting the move because they believe she can still recover, said the treatment by the hospital had destroyed her faith in the medical profession.

'I really trusted the doctors,' she said. 'I held her hand and said so. I am a nurse. I reassure and encourage people every day. That’s my job. I’ll never be able to reassure anyone ever again.'

She said that she had been appalled by the behavior of the doctors at the hospital who she alleges have been 'heartless' in their treatment of the family.

She said a few days after her daughter’s complications the hospital told them the only option was to contact the coroner.

But when the family asked for a second opinion, she claims the hospital’s Chief of Pediatrics Dr David Durand was brutal in his reply.

'We asked for a second opinion and Dr David Durand came in and said "What don’t you understand? She is dead, dead, dead".'

'I couldn’t believe how heartless they were. If that happened in my hospital I would be so upset and embarrassed.

'That is when we got an attorney involved. Now all we want is to be free of Children’s Hospital so that we can take her to a hospital that will care for her.

'We want to be able to say that we tried everything we could for her. We are not crazy people looking for a miracle.

'I am a nurse. I do believe the body has an amazing ability to heal itself. But these doctors are used to playing God and they are not used to people questioning their opinion.'

Mrs Chatman’s comments came as the hospital and family remain in legal stalemate, each accusing the other of misinformation.

The relatives' attorney Chris Dolan claims that the hospital is blocking their attempts to transfer Jahi to another facility, while hospital spokesman Sam Singer said that the family had not fulfilled any statutory requirements for the move.

All that is known is that arrangements have to be made before a court injunction runs out at 5pm next Tuesday or the hospital can switch off the life support machine.

The wrangling has left Mrs Chatman emotionally exhausted.

'All my tears have gone because I have cried so much,' she said. 'I am just in defense mode now. We have to take it day by day. We are a normal family. People don’t die early in our family.'
