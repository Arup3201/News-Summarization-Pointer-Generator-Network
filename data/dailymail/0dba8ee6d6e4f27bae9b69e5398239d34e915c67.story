Rhea Holley, pictured, was with a friend, both with new babies, in Costa Coffee in Purley, south London, when her son Arthur began to cry for a feed

A new mother was reduced to tears by a couple who called her a slut for breastfeeding her baby in a coffee shop.

Rhea Holley was feeding her  son Arthur, 11 months, when nearby Costa customers said she was ‘disgusting’ and should  ‘control herself’.

Mrs Holley, 27, had arranged to visit the coffee shop with a friend who also had a baby.

Yesterday she said: ‘Arthur was asleep so I went in and ordered us some drinks and cake. While we sat there he woke up and was quite upset so I started to breastfeed.

‘A couple were on a table facing in such a way that they did not have to look at me. I heard one of them say “it is disgusting” and I was a “slut”.’

Writing on her blog, she added that her friend had confronted the couple, who were in their late 60s.

They told her it was ‘offensive’ and she should breastfeed in the cafe’s toilet. The woman added: ‘You know what time babies need feeding. Go home if you can’t control yourself.’

Mrs Holley, an account manager, said the incident was ‘probably the most humiliating thing that’s ever happened to me’.

She is the latest in a series of women to be abused for breastfeeding in public. Last month, the head of the Royal College of Midwives said it  suggested that nursing mothers were being demonised.

Support: Staff at this Costa Coffee in Purley, south London, pictured, 'reprimanded the couple' 
who had made the abusive remarks to new mother Rhea Holley

Rhea Holley, pictured right with son Arthur, praised staff at Costa Coffee (file picture left) for supporting her after she was branded 'disgusting' by a pair of elderly customers while she was breast-feeding

Professor Cathy Warwick said that 
overstretched health professionals were struggling to give mothers the 
individual help they sometimes need to breastfeed for longer, which is  
generally considered the healthiest choice for the baby.

Mrs
 Holley, who lives with husband Christopher, 32, in Faversham, Kent, 
said the couple made her feel ‘broken’ but praised Costa Coffee workers 
at the branch in Purley, South London.

She
 said she spoke to staff, who then ‘reprimanded’ the couple. She added: 
‘It was so good of them not only to stand by the law on breastfeeding 
but also to be so supportive of someone feeling so upset.’

The
 Equality Act 2010 makes it an offence for staff to ask a breastfeeding 
woman to leave a public place, such as a park, cafe or bus.

Emma
 Pickett, of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, said the Act left
 a loophole open because it only applied to staff and business owners, 
not other customers.

A 
spokesman for the charity Maternity Action agreed, adding: ‘We regularly
 hear from women who experience harassment because they have breastfed 
in public.

‘It’s time the 
Government started educating businesses and the wider community to 
support breastfeeding women, rather than shaming them.

‘Service
 providers have to intervene and support women if they are  experiencing
 difficulties with other customers, but legislation does not 
specifically outlaw customers from making comments such as those 
directed at Mrs Holley.’

A spokesman for Costa said: ‘We have always been very happy for mothers to breastfeed in stores.’

In
 March, Heather Vaughan, 29, said she was left in tears after a male 
staff member at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth 
ordered her to stop breastfeeding in its creche, saying: ‘We don’t  do 
that here.’

The same month, Emily Slough was branded a ‘tramp’ by 
internet trolls after somebody took a photograph of her breastfeeding in
 public in Rugeley, Staffordshire.

Elsewhere, nurses stopped Gemma 
Murphy, 37, from feeding her infant daughter in a waiting room at St 
Cross Hospital in Rugby.

The
 Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding 
woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport

It states that a business cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age.

In
 Government guidelines, companies are advised to make sure women they 
are providing a service to 'are allowed to breast feed on your premises 
if they want to'.

It also advises that staff are trained to understand the rights of breast feeding mothers.

Under the Act 2010, discriminating against someone because they are with a breastfeeding mother is also prohibited.
