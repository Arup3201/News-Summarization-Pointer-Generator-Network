Cuffed: A tearful Aisling Brady McCarthy enters the courtroom

An Irish nanny accused of killing a baby in her care broke down in tears as she begged a judge to grant her bail while she awaits her trial for murder.

Wearing a dark knitted jumper and sobbing throughout proceedings, Aisling Brady McCarthy looked on as her lawyers called for her to be released.

They argued that prosecutors have failed to turn over critical evidence they need to defend her against murder charges.

The 35-year-old is accused of smashing Rehma Sabir's skull on the child's first birthday in January.

The tot was rushed to hospital with severe head injuries but died two days later.

McCarthy’s lawyers argued that the case against her is weaker than prosecutors claimed after she was arrested.

They
 cited notes of police interviews in which they say the baby’s mother 
appears to have said 'no issues with nanny' when questioned the night 
she was rushed to the hospital.

Prosecutors
 say McCarthy, 35, 'violently' injured the baby, whose family lived in 
Cambridge, just outside Boston. McCarthy lived in nearby Quincy.

Judge S. Jane Haggerty said she expects to rule on the bail request later today.

The judge also said she expects to rule by the end of the week on a defense request to dismiss the charges against McCarthy.

McCarthy’s
 lawyers argued that prosecutors presented 'false and deceptive' 
information to a grand jury, including evidence about earlier bone 
fractures the girl had with no accompanying evidence linking the 
injuries to McCarthy.

On 
Tuesday, the defense told the judge that prosecutors still have not 
turned over medical reports about the earlier fractures and other 
evidence vital to their defense of McCarthy.

'An innocent person sits in jail while we are begging for discovery,' attorney Melinda Thompson said.

Assistant District Attorney Patrick 
Fitzgerald said prosecutors have turned over more than 500 pages of 
notes from doctors at Children’s Hospital, where the baby was treated, 
and grand jury testimony, including that of a doctor on the earlier bone
 fractures.

He said prosecutors are waiting for medical reports on the fractures from outside experts.

Aisling McCarthy was accused of living illegally in the U.S. for more than 13 years

Fitzgerald didn’t comment directly on 
the defense claim that the prosecution’s case against McCarthy is weaker
 than what was presented to the grand jury that indicted her, but he 
said he doesn’t think McCarthy should be granted bail.

'I see nothing that has changed relevant to the issue of bail,' he said.

After
 McCarthy’s arrest, immigration officials said she was in the United 
States illegally after arriving from Ireland in 2002, when she was 
authorized to stay only 90 days.

During an earlier hearing, McCarthy, accused prosecutors of presenting 'false and deceptive' information to a grand jury.

The defense attorney made the allegations against prosecutors as she asked a judge to dismiss the charges.

A
 prosecutor said the evidence was not misleading or false, and that 
authorities had to present a complete picture of the girl's injuries.

The judge did not immediately rule.

The nanny's lawyers also claimed 
Boston prosecutors acted unethically in the way they presented evidence 
to the grand jury that indicted her for the murder.

They
 were seeking the charges to be dismissed based on the alleged 
prosecutorial misconduct as well as a general lack of probable cause.

Her lawyers accuse Middlesex prosecutors
 of acting unethically in the way they presented evidence to the grand 
jury but there were no further details on how.

Questions have been raised about the 
length of time between when McCarthy was arrested, on January 21, and when 
indictments were obtained, some 80 days later.

The defense also contends the case is so weak that it does not meet the low legal threshold of probable cause.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement to The Boston Globe in August, her office is working on a response to the defense allegations, which they will soon file in court.

No bail: McCarthy, who has been in the United 
States illegally for the last 13 years, is being held without bail on 
charges of first-degree murder and assault

McCarthy was arraigned April 18 in Middlesex Superior Court, where she pleaded 
not guilty to all charges and was ordered held without bail.

She faces being deported 
to Ireland when the criminal case ends because she was living in Boston 
illegally, according to federal officials.

She
 is accused of slamming little Rehma against a wall and changing table 
before pretending its lifeless body was sleeping to its relatives.

Defense
 attorneys have claimed the baby was already 'sick' and 'not normal' 
while in her care before she was found bruised and unconscious in her 
family's Cambridge, Massachusetts home.

woke up

Rehma Sabir was 
hospitalized with severe head injuries on her first birthday, January 
14, before being declared brain dead two days later.

In April, prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said McCarthy violently shook 
Rehma, possibly bouncing the infant's skull off a changing table and a 
wall, as seen by plaster shattered from the wall.

McCarthy has been in the U.S. illegally for the past 13 years.
