A man making a hospital visit has been left horrified after a strange woman pushed a trash bag on him which contained a blood-soaked baby boy.

Justin Goldfarb had been visiting his girlfriend on Saturday night at Maryview Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia when the shocking incident took place.

He was at the hospital entrance at 8pm when a woman got out her car and placed the bag on the ground, shouting at Goldfarb: 'Hey 
you, can you come here'.

Shock: Jason Goldfarb was handed a blood-soaked baby in a trash bag by a woman at a Virginia hospital on Saturday night

Care and attention: Nurses at the hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia have been looking after the baby named David

He said: 'I didn't think she was talking to me, so I walked over there and she was like, "You need to take that bag inside."

'She was nervous, she was scratching her arms and forearms, I guess she was kind of nervous.'

The woman then jumped back in her car and sped off. The young man took the plastic bag to a nurse who opened it to find the newborn baby inside.

The Safe Haven Law allows an individual to give up a baby with no questions asked and without fear of being prosecuted.

The purpose of the law is to protect new but unwanted babies from coming to harm or being abandoned in dangerous circumstances.

Mothers unable to cope are often under severe emotional distress and this law allows them a way out from actions that may be committed in fear or desperation.

The law was introduced in Texas in 1999 and now each state in the U.S. has a slightly different version of the legislation.

Mr Goldfarb added: 'When she picked up the bag, you could see the baby's face in the bottom of the bag bleeding.'

The bag was 'dripping but not gushing with blood', he told WTKR.

The newborn was cold to the touch but is
 healthy and appeared to have been carried to full-term.

The baby has been given the biblical name David by nurses at the hospital.

Hospital staff 
were caring for the child and Child Protective Services had been 
informed.

Under Virginia's Safe Haven law, any 
new mother can leave a baby that is up to 14 days old with an employee 
at an emergency room with no questions asked and no fear of prosecution.

However charges are pending in this case, according to wavy.com.

Mr Goldfarb said: 'I'm not sure why people would do that 
when she could just take it in to the hospital instead of just dropping 
it off at the front door and expecting somebody else to take it in.

'I dreamed about it a couple 
nights in a row and I hope I don't dream about it tonight. I'm going to 
remember that when I'm old and in a wheelchair.'
