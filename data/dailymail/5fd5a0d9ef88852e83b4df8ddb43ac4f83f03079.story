A teacher has been accused of hacking her disabled daughter to death and then burning her body on a barbecue.

Wheelchair-bound Magdalena Nunyango Amunyoko, who was born with a condition that restricted her body functions, was allegedly murdered at the home she shared with her mother in the town of Ongwediva, in northern Namibia.

The charred remains of the 26-year-old’s badly burnt body were discovered by her brother on Saturday morning.

Her mother, a teacher at Shapwa Combined School in Ongwedia, has been detained at the Oshakati Intermediate Hospital’s psychiatric ward and is receiving treatment.

According to The Namibian, Amunyoko’s wheelchair, household appliances and newspapers were also found burned along with a fan, dishes, cups, a satellite dish, clothes and a machete.

The website reports how neighbours said 
the woman's mother had been ‘behaving strangely’ on the day of the 
gruesome murder and that she could be seen collecting various items in 
the house.

Sources revealed that in the days before her death, Amunyoko's two brothers had been 'chased' from the property by their mother, who may have been suffering from a mental illness described as 'not severe'.

The neighbour said: ‘That woman has been acting strangely of late and that day (Friday), we saw her through the windows packing her TV sets and decoders but we just thought she was moving out of the house or something and we could not ask her because she had not spoken to us for some months.’

One of the suspect’s two sons is reported to have come to the family home and after becoming suspicious, searched the house – only to find his sister’s remains behind the property.

Amunyoko was reportedly raised by her grandmother at their home village at Okakukaumbe-Okando in Omusati Region but she went to live with her mother when she graduated as a teacher.

Police confirmed the alleged murder during a press briefing.

Amunyoko's mother was due to appear in the Oshakati Magistrates’ Court this week.
