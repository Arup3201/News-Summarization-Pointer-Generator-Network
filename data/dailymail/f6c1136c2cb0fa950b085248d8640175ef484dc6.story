The move to Australia which catapulted Burgess into the pantheon of rugby league greats was a case of an on-field warrior being lured by an on-screen Gladiator.

In 2008, Sam was ruled out of England selection due to injury, so he, Luke and three friends spent five weeks backpacking Down Under. He caught the bug and upon returning home, informed Bradford of his desire to move to the other side of the world, to play in the NRL. 

His life changed when he received a call from the owner of South Sydney Rabbitohs — a certain Russell Crowe.

‘Midway through the 2009 season I was desperate to go to Australia,’ said Sam. ‘I got this call off a private number and it turned out to be Russell. As I’ve said before, I thought it was a prank call and hung up!

‘At that stage, no-one from South Sydney had called me, so the first call I got from them was from Russell Crowe. It was surreal!

‘I had watched Gladiator and it’s a mega film. I knew exactly who he was. I went to meet him two weeks later where he was filming, in Derby. For that first meeting, I went down with four or five of my mates. There were about 10 of us sitting around a big table at the hotel he was staying in. We had a feed and a few beers.

The 25-year-old was given a hero's reception by fans at Redfern Oval after the Grand Final victory 

‘The next day he asked me to come over and meet him again, where he was filming. My mum came down as well. We sat in his trailer for three-and-a-half hours, drank coffee and chatted. We spoke about what I went through with my dad, about my family and what I wanted to do in Australia.’

The player whom Crowe would go on to acclaim as the ‘sparkly-eyed man’ earned a contract with the Rabbitohs and the actor served as his tour guide when he made the move.

‘For the first week or two I spent every day with him,’ said Burgess. ‘We would get on bikes and cycle all around Sydney. I would finish training at 1.30pm, meet Russell at 2.30 and we’d ride for 30km around town — every single day. I was absolutely knackered, but I couldn’t say no! It was a great experience.

‘We’re so close now; we talk about really personal stuff. He’s a friend for life.’
