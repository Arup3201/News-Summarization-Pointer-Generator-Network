When he vented his frustration about holiday prices shooting up during the school half-term break, Paul Cookson struck a chord with other parents.

His rant to 250 Facebook friends quickly went viral as outraged parents shared his post about rip-off prices 143,000 times.

Now the issue may even be debated in Parliament after more than 100,000 signed an online petition calling for the Government to curb prices.

Father-of-one Paul Cookson, 41, wrote an online tirade about price hikes during school holidays - it went viral

A survey by the Daily Mail yesterday showed that some holidays will more than double in cost during half-term next month.

Mr
 Cookson, 41, who was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip 
to Center Parcs with his seven-year-old daughter Phoebe, said he was 
stunned by the response on social media.

His
 initial post asked why parents should be penalised for doing the right 
thing and not taking their children away during term time.

He
 then set up a Facebook group, Holiday Price Increase, and one member 
posted a link to an online petition titled ‘Stop holiday companies 
charging extra in school holidays’ which at the time had only about 
3,000 signatures.

Price rise: Mr Cookson noticed that the cost of a stay at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest, pictured, went up by £300 during half-term week

Mr Cookson, of Chillington, Devon, said: ‘It was exactly what I would’ve started, so I thought I may as well help it along.’

The
 sales director started his post after trying to book a villa at Center 
Parcs Sherwood Forest during half-term last October and finding that the
 price was £300 higher than for the week before.

He wrote: ‘Share this post if you have also had enough.’

‘I think I’ve touched a nerve with this one,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why I should be penalised for sticking to the rules.’

Mother-of-two
 Donna Thresher, from Essex, set up the petition last March in protest 
at the £600 difference in the cost of taking her family away during 
school holidays.

She thought
 the petition, which calls for a cap on price rises in the school 
holidays, was ‘dead in the water’ – until Mr Cookson’s Facebook post 
ignited interest in it.

Campaigns
 which reach 100,000 signatures on the Government’s e-petitions website 
can be given parliamentary time, although no decision has been taken 
yet.

Mr Cookson acknowledged
 that the call for price regulation might not be successful but said 
that it was raising awareness and increasing the chance that travel 
firms would change their policies.

New rules mean head teachers can grant pupils absence outside school holidays only in exceptional circumstances.

The sales director from the South Hams in Devon set up a Facebook group called Holiday Price Increase for those who felt the same way as he does - it now has more than 12,000 members

The
 Association of British Travel Agents said that one solution would be to
 stagger school holiday dates, rather than having most pupils off at the
 same time.

The Department 
for Education said academies and free schools already had the power to 
set different term dates, with council-run schools being given it from 
2015.

The National Union of 
Teachers has warned this could result in travel firms extending the 
periods in which they charge higher prices.

The
 Department for Business said the UK holiday industry relied on profits 
from peak periods, while Center Parcs said its prices were based on 
supply and demand.
