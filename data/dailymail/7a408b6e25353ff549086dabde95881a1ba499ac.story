A 51-year-old man appeared in court today charged with the attempted murder of a four-year-old boy during a horrific Easter Monday stabbing.

Steve Frogg of Mansfield was remanded in custody after a brief hearing at the town's magistrates' court this morning.

The bloodsoaked child was found 
wandering the streets with multiple stab wounds after he was attacked outside his home while playing with a neighbour's kittens.

Frogg's alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is conscious and in a stable condition at the Queen's Medical Centre in nearby Nottingham, police say.

Cordon: Police guard the scene in Frederick Street, Mansfield, where a four-year-old boy was stabbed

The child's father revealed he 
had left his animal-obsessed son playing with a Mansfield neighbour's kittens when
the attack took place.

Frogg, dressed in a white T-shirt and
dark trousers, spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, and to
indicate that he understood the proceedings.

The public gallery was empty for the two-minute hearing today.

On Monday the child was rushed to Nottingham’s
Queen’s Medical Centre, where he was treated for stab wounds to the 
head, neck and both sides of his lower torso.

Police said in a statement 'A 51-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after an attack on a four-year-old boy.

'The child was found with serious injuries, believed to be stab wounds, in Frederick Street, Mansfield just before 1.30pm on Monday.

'He remains in a conscious and stable condition at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre.

'Police believe the attack was an isolated incident.'

The child's father wept last night as as he spoke about the attack, revealing he had left his son playing with kittens while he did some shopping - and 
returned to a storm of sirens.

He said: 'I had been looking after him for the week. We had been having a great time. He was due to go back to his mum at Monday teatime.

'My neighbour knew he was here and 
asked if he would like to play with some little kittens he had just got.
He got all excited because he loves animals.

'I left him at the neighbour’s house 
while I popped to the corner shop to get us some lunch. I bought 
ravioli, spagetti and a loaf of bread.

'I had only been gone ten minutes. As I
was walking home police cars and an ambulance came rushing down the 
street. I thought, ‘Crikey, someone’s in serious trouble’.

Horrified neighbours alerted police 
after spotting the bloodied, sobbing youngster outside a house in 
Frederick Street, Mansfield, Nottingham, at about 1.30pm on Easter 
Monday.

His son had already been rushed away by paramedics.

It is understood Frogg is not a relative of the boy but is known to his family.

Search: Forensic teams have been scouring the scene for clues today

The father says that as he reached his 
end of the road, a neighbour approached him and told him terrible had 
happened and his son had been rushed to hospital.

The distraught father continued: 'Doctors say my boy’s going to be OK.

'He’s got loads of stitches on the top
of his head and down his neck to his shoulder. He’s also got wounds on 
either side near his waist. He’s also had a head scan.

'I’ve no idea why he was attacked. 
The police haven’t told me anything. I’ve spoken to a police inspector 
who said he would be back to ask me some questions.

Investigation: A 51 year-old Steve Frogg has been arrested and charged with attempted murder

'I’ve lived here for only seven weeks.
The neighbour I left him with seemed an OK guy. He knew he liked 
animals and I didn’t have a problem leaving him at his place so he 
could play with the kittens.

'Never, ever, did I think something 
like this would happen. I’m living a nightmare. I just don’t want people
thinking I’m some sort of bad dad. I love my boy so much.'

The child was treated at the scene where he
was discovered before he was taken by ambulance to Nottingham’s Queen’s
Medical Centre, where he is still undergoing treatment.

A police spokesperson said: ‘We believe this is an isolated incident and we do not think any other parties are involved.

‘Specialist support is being provided 
for the boy and his family, while house-to-house enquiries and a full 
forensic examination of a property in Frederick Street will be carried 
out today.’

Inspector David Wilkes said police ‘are investigating events leading up to the boy sustaining stab wounds’.

Police say their enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact detectives.

The father revealed his son had been released 
from intensive care and was recovering in hospital.

He said: 'He is my only son. He is a bright lad, sprightly and everybody knows him.

'We stayed with him until he came round. He should be out of hospital within two or three days.

Shocking: The boy was taken to Queen's Medical Centre after being spotted by neighbours wandering in the street

Neighbours said the boy's parents do not 
live together. One said: 'The house where the lad was stabbed is a 
couple of doors from where his dad lives.

'I think dad must have popped out on an errand and left the boy with a neighbour.'

Another neighbour said: 'The dad has 
lived at the house for only a few months but had got friendly with his 
neighbours. I hadn't seen him with the boy before.

'Perhaps he was looking after him 
while the mum was doing something else over Easter. It must have been 
awful for the mum when she was told what happened to her little boy.'

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
