A yoga teacher who nursed her boyfriend after he suffered a stroke had to flee Britain when he started bombarding her with abusive letters.

Alessia Avellino, 42, said her relationship with 51-year-old Paul Bijl broke down after the stroke four years ago completely changed his character.

But Bijl still often sent her letters and text messages calling her a ‘c***’ and ‘whore’, forcing Miss Avellino to flee her flat in St John’s Wood, north-west London, to her native Italy

She told the London Evening Standard: ‘He looked the same after the stroke but had become someone else. I couldn’t handle it. It destroyed me. I cried myself to sleep every day.’

Miss Avellino, who is also an artist and has exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts, said Bijl ‘went bananas that I had left him’ and would shout at her in front of other people.

She withdrew a harassment case after he promised to change, but then called police when the abuse became ‘relentless’. Bijl has since admitted harassment at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

The Westminster resident was sentenced to six months of community service and handed an indefinite restraining order, but Miss Avellino stressed that he is ‘no monster’ and ‘needs help’.

Speaking to Standard reporter Anna Dubuis, she added: ‘When it happened it destroyed me.

'My self-esteem was in tatters. I loved him so much - that’s why it was so hard to get away from him.

‘I was convinced he was the love of my life. I hoped he would change. When I finally saw he wasn’t going to, I said it was over.’

Miss Avellino studied at the Chelsea College of Arts and has also exhibited paintings at the Rivington Gallery in east London.
