Animated films have become the UK’s most popular film genre for the first time.

The success of Despicable Me 2, which brought in £247 million, tipped the scales and stole the show from action films- the UK’s former favourite.

Figures from the British Film Institute show millions flocked to cinemas to see animated movies like Frozen, Monster’s University and The Croods, all of which bagged a place in the top ten films for 2013.

For the first time ever, animation is the most popular genre, with Despicable Me taking £247 million

Oliver Hyatt, chairman of Animated UK, said: ‘It’s bonkers that we’ve grown so quickly. The great thing is that in the past 20 years the industry has matured so much.’

Youngsters aged 7 – 24 are the UK’s biggest cinema fans, making up 47 per cent of total admission and have been credited with encouraging the success of animated films.

But Mr Hyatt also said the success was also down to developments in the industry.

The success of animated films like Despicable Me 2 has been attributed to the fact that young people make up the majority of cinema admissions

He reported: ‘When we have a family film released there is a lot in it for adults. I would argue that adults can sit down and watch Ratatouille. But in the past the films didn’t really cater for parents so they’d just have to go along and sit there with the kids while not getting anything out of it.’

Animation is the most popular genre, with Despicable Me taking £247 million – a £100m increase on the previous year

Youngsters aged seven to 24 are the UK’s biggest cinema fans, making up 47 per cent of total admission in 2013

Thirty-three animated films were released last year

Three of them made the UK's top ten

They represented more than 20% of the total UK box office

The UK film industry turnover is £7.3 billion, an 11 per cent share of the global box office

Cinema admissions were 165.5 million in 2013 compared to 172.5 million in 2012

He added that developments in technology meant software was much more sophisticated than in the past.

And a shift in cultural attitudes mean more and more adults aren’t snubbing animated films as movies for children.

He said: ‘People are beginning to accept animated films as an adult source of entertainment.’

The
 figures also indicated that with the exception of Gravity, British 
cinema audiences were becoming less enamoured with 3D films.

Mr
 Hyatt said: ‘It’s horrible to say 3D films are faddy because when 
they’re done well they’re brilliant. But it does look like animated 
films are taking viewers away from them. This might be because animated 
films are generally more suitable for children/

Most animated films are made in America but Mr Hyatt said the UK market is set to experience some exciting changes.

He reported additional funding from the BFI’s Vision Awards, which were launched last year.

He said: ‘It’s going to be really exciting to see what happens over the next four years in the UK animated film sector.’
