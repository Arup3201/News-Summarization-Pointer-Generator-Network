AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi says Clarence 
Seedorf could stay on as AC Milan manager next season despite reports 
that the Dutchman will be replaced in the summer.

Milan
 are currently languishing at eighth place and head into the final 
weekend of the Serie A season looking to grab a place in the Europa 
League.

'It wasn't a 
mistake to sign him in January. We thought that he had all the 
requisites to be a good manager,' former Italian prime minister 
Berlusconi told Radio24 on Friday.

'At the end of the season we will have a board meeting and we will make a decision together.

'It's
 not excluded that Seedorf continues as coach, if we can find an 
agreement on what type of relationship he should have with the club.'

Seedorf replaced Massimiliano Allegri as the manager after ending his playing career at Botafogo in Brazil.

Local
 media reports have claimed he is almost certain to leave in the summer,
 despite recent good form that has seen them win six of their last eight
 games and stay in contention for a Europa League spot going into the 
final day of the season.

Milan
 host already-safe Sassuolo on Sunday and are currently on 54
 points, a point behind Parma and two behind sixth-placed Torino, who 
occupy the last Europa League place and play at Fiorentina.

Hope: AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi (centre) has not ruled out that Seedorf could stay on

Milan
 need to beat Sassuolo and hope that Parma do not win at relegated 
Livorno at home and Torino lose at Fiorentina, as the latter drew both 
their matches with Milan this season and have a superior goal 
difference.

Should Torino 
draw, Milan will need to beat Sassuolo by four goals or more to overtake
 Giampiero Ventura's surprise package and seal a European spot.

They
 also need Hellas Verona, who are ninth but level on points with Milan 
do not win at Napoli. Should Parma not win and Torino, Milan and Verona 
all finish on 57 points, Torino would take sixth spot due to their 
better mini-league record against the other two.

However,
 even qualifying for Europe might not be enough to save Seedorf, as 
Milan Chief Executive Adriano Galliani was caught on camera during last 
weekend's 2-1 defeat at Atalanta describing the Dutchman as 'mad' for 
not playing Adel Taarabt instead of the off-form Keisuke Honda.

Playing days: Seedorf made 300 appearances in a 10-year spell as a player with the Italian giants

While
 carrying out his community service in an old peoples' home, Berlusconi 
recently said that he had met 'lots of people who could keep the Milan 
dressing room under control'.

If
 the 38-year-old Seedorf is sacked, former AS Roma and Zenit St 
Petersburg coach Luciano Spalletti is reportedly the front-runner to 
replace him.

According to 
reports, Milan are also considering Fiorentina manager Vincenzo 
Montella, Parma coach Roberto Donadoni and Filippo Inzaghi, currently 
managing the club's youth team, as possible replacement.
