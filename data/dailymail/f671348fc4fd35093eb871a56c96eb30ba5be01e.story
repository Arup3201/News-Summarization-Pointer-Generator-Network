Where else but Australia can you view kangaroos and koalas in the wild, watch the sunrise in the Outback or witness Aboriginal traditions stretching back to the dawn of time? 

From the mysterious Red Centre to the glittering waters of the Great Barrier Reef, it is a land of unique, yet accessible adventures, the ultimate destination for that once-in-a-lifetime trip.

Next month's new pension rules make funding a grand tour more feasible - and right now, there's a favourable exchange rate for British visitors, too.

Tourism Australia reports a 12 per cent surge as more of us seize the opportunity, often breaking the journey there with a few days in Bangkok, Dubai or Singapore.

Recent television shows have also been whetting the public's appetite for travel Down Under.

In the BBC's A Cook Abroad - Rick Stein's Australia, the celebrity chef revealed why bountiful fresh seafood and sublime produce, served by friendly Aussies, is making this land the next big foodie destination.

And Jimmy's Australian Food Adventure on More4 sees British farmer and food expert Jimmy Doherty trace Australia's award-winning passion for food back 50,000 years. It's completely fascinating.

Joining an escorted tour is the easiest way to see Australia. It means you'll reach all the right places, with a tour manager and specialist local guides to take care of you the whole way.

And far from being about long coach rides, the latest tours make it easy to access the most iconic places and hidden wonders, usually by air and at a steady, manageable pace. The itinerary will have been expertly arranged.

All you'll have to think about is being in the magical moment, soaking up each incredible Aussie experience as it comes.

One day you might find yourself being guided through the southern night sky by an indigenous star-talker during a Sounds of Silence dinner at Uluru - rounding off a day when you've ridden through the Red Centre on a camel or on the back of a Harley-Davidson.

Another day you might be watching migrating whales, skimming over coral in a semi-submersible, or snorkelling for a close-up views of turtles and tropical fish. 

Each place will bring a new way to engage with nature and the vibrant Australian lifestyle - you'll never have felt so alive. Here's what a tour might also include: 

PERTH breathes west-coast optimism. View the glowing skyline of the City Of Lights from a delicious dinner cruise boat on the Swan River. Meet and greet a colony of 200 wild dolphins in crystal-clear waters, en route to lunch in the premier wine-growing area around Margaret River.

MELBOURNE is full of bespoke charm, with free tram rides in the European-style centre. Treats here include dinner on an historic tramcar and visits to the amazing botanical gardens. 

The city is the gateway to the circular Great Southern Touring Route and the Great Ocean Road, which passes stunning rock formations such as the Twelve Apostles. And Phillip Island, 90 minutes from Melbourne, is home to teeming Australian wildlife and the world-famous little penguins' parade.

ALICE SPRINGS introduced the Royal Flying Doctor Service - and is the closest city to Uluru - or Ayers Rock as it is otherwise known. Watch the iconic sandstone rock change through burnished oranges and reds at sunrise and sunset.

CAIRNS is the launch pad for sunrise balloon rides over the Atherton Tablelands, rail and cable car trips through rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. The best tours take guests by high-speed catamaran to pontoons moored on the outer reef - which is unspoiled and far superior to the tourist hotspots.

SYDNEY is where most tours converge. After a seaplane flight over the city, a dip in the surf at Bondi Beach, a fiery curry in the city's Thainatown, a sail on an America's Cup yacht or a lunch cruise around Sydney Harbour, you'll know you've been in another world. 

Why not top off this life-enhancing holiday with dinner overlooking the iconic Opera House? Just one more incredible Aussie moment to add to a stack of memories that will stay with you for ever.
