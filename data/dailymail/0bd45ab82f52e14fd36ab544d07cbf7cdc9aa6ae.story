An OAP singer proved she still has the X Factor when she appeared on TV in a red corset and suspenders performing Beyonce’s hit Sweet Dreams.

Grandmother Neda Ukraden, 64, from Belgrade, Serbia, stunned viewers of the X Factor style competition. The programme, confusingly named 'Your Face Sounds Familiar', sees contestants imitate famous performers, strutting their stuff alongside professional dancers.

The former pop singer-turned-restaurant-owner, who used to be a performer in the former Yugoslavia, received a standing ovation as she gyrated and semi-twerked her way through the Beyonce classic.
