A San Francisco parking attendant went for a 12-block ride last Thursday sprawled across the hood of a car while the driver inside screamed in panic.

The picture of the incident looks too perfect to be real, but the resulting criminal charges are certainly not. 

Allison Yates was driving in the right-hand lane when a car driven by Bo Mounsombath, 33, sped by on her left and passed multiple lanes of traffic to turn right.

Shocking: Bo Mounsombath, 33, allegedly jumped in her car when she was being given a parking citation, though she claims she thought the meter maid was trying to sexually harass her

It took a moment before Yates realized there was a man clinging to the hood of the speeding vehicle.

Yates told Hoodline that she caught up with the car a few blocks later and snapped the photo. According to Yates, Mounsombath 'was screaming, he was screaming, it was insane.'

The story gets stranger. San Francisco police say Mounsombath was trying to flee a parking ticket when she sped at an officer and hit a motorcyclist while Mounsombath claims she bolted because she believed the man was posing as a parking attendant to solicit sexual favors.

Mounsombath told KRON 4 the officer said she could 'do things instead of getting a parking citation which led me to believe he was posing as a meter maid.'

Distraught, she climbed into the car to get away and the officer jumped on the hood. Mounsombath says she stopped several times. 

'At one point the cars were stopped at the light and she actually hopped out,' Yates confirmed, saying that at least once the officer had a chance to get off.

Driver: Mounsombath says she stopped several times but the parking attendant wouldn't get off the hood of her car

Parked: Witness Allison Yates says that she saw the car stop once when Mounsombath got out to yell at the officer, before the light turned green and everyone 'got back on and kept moving'

'She was yelling, guy on the car was yelling, motorcycle guy was yelling, and the light turned green and they all got back on and kept moving.'

SFPD spokesperson Officer Albie Esparza confirmed that a parking attendant was involved in the altercation, saying he was issuing a citation when Mounsombath got in the car and sped at the officer.

Mounsombath was charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon and misdemeanor hit-and-run and was arraigned in court on Wednesday.
