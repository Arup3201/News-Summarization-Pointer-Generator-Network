West Ham have been fined £71,000 and reprimanded by FIFA after they played Diafra Sakho in an FA Cup win 18 days after he withdrew from Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations squad.

Sakho scored in the 1-0 victory at Ashton Gate and the governing body opened an investigation to see if they had breached rules over international duty.

The Hammers vigorously denied any wrongdoing but could have faced expulsion from the FA Cup if they were found guilty.

West Ham were paid £90,000 by the FA for winning their fourth round tie against Bristol City. 

The Hammers also earned a live broadcast fee of £247,500 after their game was shown live on BBC One.

They will receive the same amount again for their fifth round clash with West Brom, which has been chosen for live coverage by BT Sport.

If Sam Allardyce's men manage to win at the Hawthorns - or in a replay - the club will pocket another £180,000 from the FA's prize fund.

Earned in fourth round: £337,500 

Guaranteed fifth round earnings: £247,500

Potential fifth round earnings: £427,500 

FIFA rules say a player cannot appear for a club if he was meant to be on international duty and they released a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming the fine.

It stated: 'The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has found the club and the player to have violated art. 5 of Annexe 1 of the Regulations in relation to the match played by Sakho on 25 January 2015. The club has been fined CHF 100,000 in accordance with art. 10 c) and art. 15 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC) and issued with a reprimand, while the player has been sanctioned with a reprimand in accordance with art. 10 b) and art. 14 of the FDC.'

Senegal were furious that Sakho played for West Ham 48 hours after they were knocked out of the competition.

The Hammers insisted the player had a back injury that prevented him from flying and claim he was driven to Ashton Gate in a limousine for the FA Cup tie. They requested FIFA dismiss the case. 

West Ham issued a brief statement following FIFA's decision.

'The club and the player have received the decision and will now be focusing their concentration on the game against Manchester United on Sunday,' it read.

Bristol City also released a statement on their website which read: 'Bristol City FC notes FIFA’s decision with regards to the Disciplinary Committee’s case against West Ham United and their player Diafra Sakho.

'The club is disappointed with the penalty handed down by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and is considering its options.'

Hammers co-chairman David Sullivan told Sportsmail last week: 'A top back surgeon said Sakho can't fly and he still can't fly. He went by car to Bristol.

'We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred while playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.'

Manager Sam Allardyce, who left Sakho out of the Premier League trip to Liverpool on Saturday, said: 'I'm not worried that he will face a ban. We have stuck by every rule and regulation in the book.'

FIFA can today confirm the decisions of its Disciplinary Committee in the case involving the English club West Ham United and the player Diafra Sakho.

Diafra Sakho was called up by the Senegalese Football Association on 18 December 2014 to play for Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations 2015 taking place in Equatorial Guinea between 17 January and 8 February 2015, as well as to attend the training camp of the said representative team from 5-16 January 2015 in Morocco.

The Senegalese FA was informed by West Ham United that Sakho was prevented from playing and travelling by plane due to injury and thus he did not join the Senegal team.

On 25 January 2015, the player took part in an official match for his club West Ham United. Senegal were eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations 2015 on 27 January 2015.

In view of the above and in accordance with art. 6 par. 1 of Annexe 1 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (hereinafter the Regulations), disciplinary proceedings were opened against the player and the club for a potential violation of Annexe 1 of the Regulations.

The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has found the club and the player to have violated art. 5 of Annexe 1 of the Regulations in relation to the match played by Sakho on 25 January 2015. The club has been fined CHF 100,000 in accordance with art. 10 c) and art. 15 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC) and issued with a reprimand, while the player has been sanctioned with a reprimand in accordance with art. 10 b) and art. 14 of the FDC.

The terms of the decisions were notified to the relevant parties today.
