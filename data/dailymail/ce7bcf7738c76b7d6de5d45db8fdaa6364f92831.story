Manchester United stars are forced to hand in their mobile phones the night before a match under strict new rules from manager Louis van Gaal. 

The Dutchman has laid down the law since taking over from David Moyes this summer and also drops any player who is late for breakfast on the morning of a game.

But so far, Van Gaal's methods have failed to yield results with United failing to win any of their first three Premier League fixtures.

Laying down the law: Van Gaal also drops any player who is late for breakfast on the morning of a game

After an opening day defeat by Swansea, they drew with Sunderland and Burnley and were also thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

Van Gaal has a history of taking a no-nonsense approach to management. 

In Maarten Meijer's biography of his compatriot, he wrote that while in charge of Ajax, Van Gaal fined players if they were even a minute late for breakfast - it was doubled if it happened again. The squad also had to start eating together and Van Gaal preferred that they only talk about football.

At United, the 63-year-old ordered the first team and the youth squads to eat together while he introduced a strict 1pm lunch and the installation of £500,000 worth of HD cameras at United's Carrington training centre.

Defender Jonny Evans said during the club's US tour in pre-season: ‘We have this system at the minute where he can watch us on the pitch. The manager is saying, “You should be five yards to the right”.

‘We went through a video last night and I was 10 yards out. There are things you are doing on the pitch, and the whole team will be feeling the same, where you are thinking, "Am I in the right position?" Then the manager will show you in the video and you will know.'

The mobile phone rule was introduced by Sir Alex Ferguson in an attempt to prevent the leak of team news.
