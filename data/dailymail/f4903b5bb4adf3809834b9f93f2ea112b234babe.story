Beaming in the spring sunshine on a rare day out without baby Mia, a radiant Zara Phillips was the picture of maternal joy.

Seven weeks after she became a mum, there was no sign of the dreaded snap-back — the worrying trend in which celebrities shed their baby weight the second they leave the delivery suite. Nor has she succumbed to the pressure to stay indoors, away from prying eyes, until all signs of her pregnancy have been sweated off in the gym.

As pictures of her enjoying herself at Cheltenham races this week prove, Zara is clearly taking a sensible approach to losing her baby weight. She is not showing off the flat tummy, model-esque legs or toned arms boasted by so many other post-partum celebrities, but, in short, she looks just like any other new mother.

A day at the races: Zara chose an empire-line coat and opaque tights in her favourite colours for a day out at Cheltenham, after giving birth 7 weeks and 4 days ago

Hurrah for Zara! But while I wholeheartedly congratulate her for embracing her new figure, with its magnificent bosom and gently rounded stomach, I certainly can’t applaud her fashion choices.

She’s often been criticised in the past, and again, here, the proportions are all wrong. The tiny hat only serves to make her seem bigger than she is. The empire-line cream coat drapes down from her new fuller bust, making her look a little like a ship in full sail, while the fussy horizontal bows and the high neckline do nothing to flatter her lovely new curves.

And while endlessly fashionable, those clumpy shoe-boots don’t make the most of her excellent legs.

Never known for her fashion sense, it seems Zara has made the classic mistake of jumping into her pre-baby style before her body has had a chance to ping back.

I sympathise. I’ve been there. In the months after giving birth most women develop a strange kind of body dysmorphia — you’ve been huge for months, so as your bump deflates you suddenly feel svelte again.

Overnight, getting dressed seems more appealing; after an eternity wearing your husband’s jogging bottoms and hideous maternity tents, perhaps it’s time to get your pre-baby look back? Any mother will remember that moment — it’s incredibly exciting. So exciting, in fact, that it’s all too easy to overlook the signs that you’re not quite back to your old self just yet.

I recall one favourite jumpsuit that I couldn’t wait to wear after the birth of my son Mackenzie, now six. Three months after he was born I got one leg in, then another. I stuffed my arms into the sleeves and even managed to zip it up. I was so delighted by this fact that I even went out in it, only to catch sight of myself in a mirror which showed up the straining fabric across my midriff.

And this is the issue; your body changes after a baby and you have to change the way you dress to suit it. It’s not about covering up, as Zara has done with her empire-line coat, it’s about accentuating your good bits and skimming the bits that need a bit more time. Dressing needs more thought, and a bit of a revamp.

Zara has worn a uniform of cream, knee-length coat, black tights and boots to Cheltenham every year for the past decade. But while it might have worked beautifully on her pre-baby body, it is not the best shape on the other side of the motherhood divide.

The raised waist of the empire line cuts across her impressive embonpoint, making her silhouette much rounder than necessary. An empire line should tuck just under your bra-line, emphasizing your amazing assets and adding definition to your shape; without that your chest and tummy merge, adding weight where there really isn’t any to hide.

 'All things considered, the most important thing for a new mother is comfort.'

Reaching for roomier clothes is a habit that many mothers fall into. The logic, which, again, I know so well, is that if you embrace baggy, no-one will notice that your waist has gone on an extended holiday. Sorry, but actually you need clothes to fit properly.

And this is something that the other young royal mum, the Duchess of Cambridge, seems well aware of. When the ever-chic Kate was photographed looking fabulous just seven weeks after giving birth to Prince George, she plumped for a dazzling floor-length gown which skimmed her frame. While comparisons of Kate’s post-baby body and Zara’s are unfair — they were completely different to start with — Zara could have opted for a longer, more fitted frock like Kate’s to break up her silhouette.

If you’re not sure of your shape, stick with wider necklines, which are much more slimming, and go for a print to break up your body.

And while Zara has wonderful legs, the black opaque tights are too harsh and unladylike against the pale coat. 

Sleeves are a major issue for new mums too; go loose and you add unwelcome volume, but too tight like Zara and we’re back to the problem with my jumpsuit — flesh straining against the fabric.

Accessories are the fun bit — they always fit — and I can imagine Zara’s glee at ditching the nappy bag for a clutch. The key is to keep things in proportion. Big accessories make you look smaller, but that hat looks like it would fit Mia.

Shoes, too, can be problematic, especially as your feet are still prone to swelling. Zara opted for a shoe-boot shape with a stiletto heel that she may be cursing after a long day at the races.

All things considered, the most important thing for a new mother is comfort. New mums need to feel comfortable in their roles, in their new wardrobes, and in themselves. But ultimately, the best accessory for every new mum is a huge smile and Zara’s got that spot on.
