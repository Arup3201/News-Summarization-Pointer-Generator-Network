Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq could be defeated within six months if Britain and America sent in ground troop, ex-army chief Lord Richards has claimed.

The former head of the Armed Forces said it was 'naïve' to think ISIS could be overcome without 'boots on the ground' and greater involvement by western armies.

David Cameron has ruled out using ground troops in the conflict, as ministers stepped up calls for Turkey to step in to defeat forces threatening a key town close to their border with Syria.

Former Army chief Lord Richards said it was 'naive' to think ISIS could be defeated without greater involvement by western forces

There has been growing frustration among members of the US-led coalition being assembled against IS at the reluctance of Turkey to intervene, despite having forces positioned on the border.

But Lord Richards said western troops would need to be sent in to tackle the threat posed by ISIS.

He told Huffington Post: 'If western boots were on the ground, if western armies were to be applied to the problem [of Islamic State], it could be over in six months.'

He stressed that British soldiers being sent in was 'not going to happen, clearly' but he said the option should remain on the table.

'The idea that you can make [the Free Syrian Army or the Peshmerga] successful in the time we have available to us... without much more active and fulsome western involvement is, I think, naive.'

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today called on Turkey to do more to tackle the threat from Islamic extremists on its border with Syria

The British government has insisted that the response to the rise of ISIS must involve an international coalition, including countries from the region.

There are growing fears that the lightly armed Kurdish defenders in Kobani - just inside Syria - could be overrun by ISIS fighters.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today urged the Turkish government to become more involved.

'Turkey certainly could help. It is a matter for Turkey, but other allies in the region have been helping,' he told the BBC Radio 4 today programme.

'This is a situation that can only be resolved, not just by America and Britain, but by the region itself so we'd certainly like to see Turkey more involved but in the end it is a decision for their government.'

Mr Fallon warned that if ISIS - also referred to as Isil (Islamic State in Syria and the Levant) and Islamic State - was not stopped, it would have severe consequences for the entire region.

'Clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to dealing with Isil otherwise we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region,' he said.

Last month the House of Commons voted in favour of air strikes, but only in Iraq.

Today Mr Fallon made clear that ministers do not believe that Parliament is ready to authorise the extension of military action into Syria.

'We don't have authority from Parliament to operate in Syria at the moment.

'Our judgment at the moment is that Parliament wouldn't give us that authority,' he said.
