An adorable baby chimp has been captured on camera apingÂ  zookeepers by brushing his teeth.

Little Mladatko, who will be 
celebrating his second birthday next month, knows it's important
to keep his teeth in top condition and was spotted going through his 
morning ritual at Bratislava zoo in Slovakia.

Every morning the sanitary simian make sure all his gnashers are cleaned, fastidiously scrubbing his front teeth before ensuring his back molars are also gleaming.

He is a huge draw to the zoo, and knows not to monkey around with dental hygiene and make sure the waiting tourists get his signature megawatt smile.

Austrian photographer Jutta Kirchner caught the cheeky chimp when she spotted him on her second visit to the zoo.

She's been interested in photography for the past 40 years and specialises in animal photography.

Jutta said: 'I'm sure the monkey knows exactly what he is doing when he's brushing his teeth because the zoo keepers taught him what to do and he doesn't cause any fuss when they pass him the brush.

'He's such a cute monkey and I first came across him a year ago so I made sure I went back again to get pictures of him brushing his teeth because I find it amazing how similar their behaviour is to what humans do.

'In an ideal world I would spend all day watching Mladatko and taking pictures because I love animals and think they always make brilliant photographs.'
