Severe amnesia: The mystery man has told police he suffers from a disorder called dissociative fugue

A man with severe amnesia who believes his name is David or Tony has been found sleeping on the streets, having forgotten his identity.

The mystery man has told police he suffers from a disorder called dissociative fugue - a condition often connected to some form of traumatic experience which can cause loss of memory.

He was brought to the attention of detectives last September after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire.

Having spent four months trying to discover his identity, police now want the public to help.

He believes his name is either David or Tony Thorpe and that his date of birth is October 5, 1955 - making him 58 - but a thorough search of both police and NHS systems has drawn blanks.

The stranger said he thought he was from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, but was not sure and also thought he could have connections in Blackpool, Lancashire.

The man is well-spoken and has a northern accent which could be from either the Yorkshire or Lincolnshire area. Authorities hope this clue could help unlock the secrets of his past.

Police officers said the mystery man is not a person who sits begging on the street and that he is not wanted for any criminal offences.

Humberside Police Detective Chief Inspector Paul Welton said: ‘This is very rare case in which somebody will come to an area, and have no idea who they are and if they have any family.

Appeal: He was brought to the attention of detectives last year after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough

‘We have not been able to establish how the man came to stop in north-east Lincolnshire, however we are doing all we can to help him find his family and friends.

‘The man is no longer sleeping rough and is being supported by the police and a number of agencies. He does not drink alcohol and does not take any form of drugs or medication.’

DCI Welton added: ‘This is a genuine case of somebody who really does need to the help of the public to return home to his family and his friends.

‘Anyone, who may think they can help this man find out who he is should call Humberside Police as a matter of urgency. We want to all we can to help him but we can't do that if somebody does not come forward to tell us who he is.’
