PC Chris Findley, 33, had been off duty when he was set upon in the early hours of Monday morningÂ  outside a nightclub.

The West Midland Police officer was punched and left unconscious in the road. He suffered serious head injuries and was taken to hospital in a critical condition but died last night.

'Hero': Friends and colleagues of PC Findley have been posting tributes on social networking websites today

PC Findley, who is still to be formally identified, had become embroiled in a row involving a black man and two white women, who had just left Divine Bar in Wolverhampton, at 4.30am.

Detectives believe the suspects, who 
were all in their late teens or early 20s, had been drinking in the nightclub in Darlington Street for several hours before the attack.

He had been with the force for nine years and patrolled the Sandwell area.

West Midlands Police Detective Inspector Phil Asquith, said: 'They got into a scuffle moments after leaving Divine Bar.

'I'd appeal for anyone who was in the club that night and may have seen them to contact police.

'Similarly I'm keen to hear from anyone 
who was driving along Darlington Street in the early hours of that 
morning, heading home after a night out or perhaps taxi drivers, as they
may have witnessed it.

Early hours: The officer was attacked outside Divine Bar in Darlington Street at around 4.30am on Monday

Tragic: PC Findley was left unconscious in the road after suffering serious head injuries in the attack

Serious assault: West Midland Police detectives have appealed for witnesses to come forward

'At the time they may have written it off as a low-level disorder but it's a very serious assault which has left one man dead.

'If anyone has any information that could assist the inquiry, who's possibly heard someone since talking about the incident, I'd ask them to call us on the 101 number as their information could prove vital.'

An 18-year-old man and two women have been arrested by police and bailed until a date next month pending further enquiries.

A post mortem is yet to be carried out, but Mr Findley's family have been informed of his death.

Police bosses today paid tribute to the 'hard-working' policeman, who they described as a 'selfless and humble man'.

Chief Inspector Paul Betts said: 'It is with great sadness that friends and colleagues mourn the passing of PC Findley who died shortly before 11pm yesterday.

'Chris, a 33-year-old single man, joined West Midlands Police in 2003 and completed all his police service in Sandwell.

'The majority of his time with the 
force was spent serving the communities of Smethwick as a valued member 
of the Neighbourhood Police Team.

'More recently he was part of a dedicated, proactive team delivering targeted policing to priority areas.

'He is fondly described by his 
colleagues as a selfless and humble man, always watching out for those 
in need of cheering up, which he achieved through his warm, infectious 
personality and sense of humour.

'Chris was a proactive, hard-working officer who was a credit to the service and the communities of Sandwell.

'Chris will be sadly missed by all 
that knew him and our thoughts and condolences go out to his close 
friends and family at this difficult time.'

Memorial: A Facebook page has been set up in honour of PC Findley, who worked in Smethwick

Devastated friends and colleagues have also been leaving tributes on social networking websites.

Stu Fitzgerald wrote on a Facebook 
page set up in his honour: 'Another good man has been lost at the hands 
of the scum we endeavour to protect all good people from... Taken from 
us all too soon, RIP PC Chris Findley.'

While fellow officer David Smith 
added: 'R.I.P. Chris Findley..a mate, fellow copper, raconteur, all 
round good guy and purveyor of fine ales.

'Now
polish your boots, tighten your belt, put your hat on and book on 
duty....your new beat awaits to patrol with the big man uptop.'
