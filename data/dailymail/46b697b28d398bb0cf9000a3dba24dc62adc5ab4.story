A £17-a-head children's party themed around Disney's Frozen that left disappointed children in tears has today been branded a 'dangerous' and 'shambolic nightmare' by parents.

Organisers have apologised after the DJ played children Right Said Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy' and an actress playing one of the film's main character Princess Anna showed too much cleavage.

Upset parents say their children were 'barged and pushed' around in 'dangerously' overcrowded rooms  and others were left 'hungry and crying' during and after the Disney-themed event.

Upset: Parents who took their children to a Frozen-themed party at Langley Park Sports and Social Club in Beckenham, have called the event a 'shambolic nightmare' after a series of blunders

The party, hosted by Perfect Kids Parties at Langley Park Sports and Social Club in Beckenham, south east London, has caused large numbers of complaints.

Mother Jodie Wise-Steppel said: 'The whole event was shambolic. Sadly, the highlight was Anna's boobs literally spilling out of her top.

'The organisers were too greedy and didn't consider the consequences.

'Me and my children were barged, pushed and shoved.'

Complaint: One mother said the actress playing the character Princess Anna showed too much of her cleavage at the event over the weekend 

The chaotic event saw hundreds of adults and their children crammed into the venue, and the promised party lunch consisted of a small amount of sweets and other unhealthy foods, she said. 

Mrs Wise-Steppel added: 'The cake lady stormed out with her Frozen-themed cake. After just minutes, there wasn't any food left, and there weren't enough seats.

'I could have done a better job on the face painting. The staff were headless chickens all shouting at each other, and the sound system was like a two-year-old's karaoke machine.'

Many of the disappointed parents slammed the events company on Twitter and Facebook, who have since deactivated their web accounts.

One mother, who did not wish to be named, took her Frozen-mad three-year-old daughter to the event.

She said: 'Last night I commented on Perfect Kids Parties Facebook page about the disappointment, as had others, but saw later that it was taken down as a page.

'I think it's not just a shame but at times bordered on chaotic and at worst could have been dangerous.

'All in all, my friends and I just left after 45 minutes, as our children, aged three and four had seen nothing, had no seat and missed the welcome cakes.'

Kathryn Marshall took her five-year-old and seven-year-old daughters, but is now demanding a refund.

She said: 'I was shocked at how badly planned and unsafe the event was.

'The kids were so squashed on the dance floor that they were unable to participate in any of the activities.

'We left after an hour with both girls crying. Not a great experience for something that cost us £35 and was supposed to be the highlight of our month.'

She also slammed the choice of music after the DJ played inappropriate gay club anthem 'I'm too sexy' which includes the lyrics 'I'm too sexy for your party, no way I'm disco dancing.'

Mother-of-two and part-time beautician Claire Jeffreys, 30, went to the expensive event with personal trainer partner Anthony Delamare and their two children.

She said: 'We had such high hopes, but it was a massive let down. It was dangerous. There were too many people there and the kids were getting crushed.

'It was awful, really really dreadful - the kids were all packed in there like sardines in a can. We were all looking forward to it, but it was just a waste of time and money.'

Party organisers were also criticised for playing songs such as Right Said Fred's (pictured) 'I'm Too Sexy'

Perfect Kids Parties have vowed to change their ways after being swamped with complaints.

A spokesman said: 'We have taken on board the honest feedback received from a minority of customers to make sure issues of parent overcrowding do not occur again and look forward to welcoming children to our future events.

'Children's safety is of paramount importance to us.' 

It's understood some parents have been contacted by Perfect Kids Parties saying it was considering their feedback and would respond to all queries within four days.
