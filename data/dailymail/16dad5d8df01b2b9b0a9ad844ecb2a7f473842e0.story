The Navy says an aerial target drone malfunctioned and struck a guided missile cruiser during training off Southern California, causing two minor injuries.

Lt. Lenaya Rotklein of the U.S. Third Fleet said the accident on the USS Chancellorsville happened on Saturday afternoon while the ship was testing its combat weapons system off Point Mugu.

She said two sailors were treated for minor burns after the ship was struck.

She said the ship was heading back to Naval Base San Diego so that officials can assess the damage.

The Navy was investigating the cause of the drone malfunction.

Rotklein said the drone was being used to test the ship's radar.

She had no immediate information on whether the drone has malfunctioned before.

About 300 crew members were aboard the ship.
