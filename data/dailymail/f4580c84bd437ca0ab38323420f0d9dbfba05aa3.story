Michael Clarke is to undergo surgery on Tuesday after he badly injured his right hamstring during Australia's first Test win over India last week.

Australian cricket officials are still no closer to knowing whether Clarke will be fit enough to play in next year's World Cup.

The 33-year-old is ruled out of the three remaining Tests against India and is facing a race against time to be ready for the World Cup, which starts Down Under in mid February.

Team doctor Peter Brukner announced: 'Michael was assessed by a surgeon in Melbourne early this evening and will be undergoing surgery tomorrow to repair his injured right hamstring.

'Whilst surgery is not always required with hamstring injuries, Michael has substantial damage to a key part of the hamstring tendon and it was felt the best course of action was to surgically repair the damaged area.

'His recovery and the timing of his return to play will be dependent on the surgeon's advice and how well he recovers in the coming weeks.'

It is he latest in a series of problems Clarke has had with his back and hamstrings.

He has already consulted with a specialist who is expected to decide on the best way to treat the problem.

'These are difficult circumstances given Michael's injury and the fact that we don't know how long he will be out of the game,' Australian chief selector Rod Marsh said on Monday.

'What we do know is that it won't be an overnight fix.'

Cricket Australia announced on Monday that Steve Smith would take over as the new Test skipper, but no decision had been made yet on the one-day team.

George Bailey is the current vice-captain and has filled in for Clarke before whenever the skipper has been sidelined.

'The next 24 to 48 hours will give us far better guidance on that process. But I think George Bailey has done a fantastic job,' Australian team performance chief Pat Howard said.

'We're No 1 in the world. He's led the last two series, so all that was discussed.'

Smith wants to lead from the front as he takes over as Australia's Test captain in the absence of the injured Michael Clarke.

The 25-year-old was on Monday promoted to the vice-captaincy, chosen ahead of the veteran Brad Haddin to lead the Aussies out against India in the second Test in Brisbane on Wednesday, with Cricket Australia indicating the decision was made with an eye on the future as Clarke's injury woes put his long-term status in doubt.

Smith is the third youngest player in the squad to play at the Gabba and will be Australia's youngest captain since Kim Hughes in the 1970s, but he promised not to let the added responsibilities change the way he approaches the game.

'I think first and foremost I will try to lead from the front in terms of my performances,' he said. 'The on-field tactics, I think we've been pretty good this year, 'Pup' (Clarke) has been amazing with that and what he's got going on. With the group we've got going forward I don't really feel there's any need for a big change there.'
