Jane Birkin was performing on stage in France when news broke that her daughter was dead, it was revealed today.

The 60s icon, best known for her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg, was 15 minutes into a concert in Besan√ßon when news of the death of Kate Barry began to filter through the auditorium.

According to French media, Birkin was singing an emotional song called Javanese a capella when her manager was told of the tragedy.

But rather than interrupt the concert, he waited for it to finish before he told Birkin that Ms Barry had been found dead on the pavement beneath her fourth-floor flat in Paris.

Shock: Ms Barry (pictured with her mother Jane Birkin and half-sister Charlotte Gainsboroug) was found soon after 6.30pm on Wednesday in the 16th arrondissement of the French capital

'She heard the news just after the 
concert,' a source told the Parisien newspaper. 'The tension was 
palpable backstage, nobody really knew what to do.'

The
46-year-old, whose father was the late James Bond composer John Barry, 
was found soon after 6.30pm on Wednesday in the 16th arrondissement of 
the French capital.

Sources say she fell 80ft from a window of her apartment, where anti-depressants were found inside.

It is just a few miles from the flat where Ms Birkin herself now lives on Paris's Left Bank.

Ms
Barry was thought to be alone inside the flat before the tragedy 
happened, and anti-depressants were said to have been found by police.

'The
matter is under investigation, but we can confirm the death,' said a 
local police spokesman. He said the front door of the floor was found 
locked.

France's culture 
minister paid a moving tribute to Ms Barry today, offering 'heartfelt 
and loving thoughts' to 'a family we all love, the French love'.

Kate Barry came from a family in the public eye.

Her mother Jane Birkin, who starred in Death on the Nile, became a sex symbol for her 13-year love affair with the French singer Serge Gainsbourg.

The pair never married but Gainsbourg raised Ms Barry like a father.

Their daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg has released four albums and is a French film star.

Meanwhile Ms Barry's father John Barry wrote all the most famous music of James Bond, including the opening theme and the hit songs for Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever, both sung by Shirley Bassey.

Earlier this year, she said: 'I've never had a week without having all three of my daughters on the telephone.

'My eldest daughter, Kate, looks most like me. She's a photographer. She had a Polaroid camera in her hand from a young age and photographed her sisters all the time.'

Ms Barry's parents separated in 1967, the year she was born in London, and she was brought up until the age of 13 by Ms Birkin and Gainsbourg, who died in 1991.

At 17, she underwent treatment for drug and alcohol addiction in central London.

She had a close relationship with groups including Alcoholics Anonymous and set up a centre for addicts in France in 1993.

Ms Barry began her career as a professional photographer in 1996 and her first major exhibition was at the Bunkamura Gallery in Tokyo in 2000.

She went on to produce pictures for a variety of publications including British Vogue and the Sunday Times magazine.
