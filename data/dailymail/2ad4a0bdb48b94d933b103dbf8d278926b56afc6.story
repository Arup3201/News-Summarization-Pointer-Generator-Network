A shocking video has emerged of an innocent bear cub being forced to fight a Russian boy - 16 years before the child allegedly became an international Ultimate Fighting Champion.

Khabib Nurmagomedov, 25, has been undefeated since he became a professional mixed martial artist in 2008 with 16 straight wins to his name.

And last year the ferocious fighter, also known as 'The Eagle', joined the notoriously violent UFC cage-fighting circuit where he boosted his winning streak to 21.

Scroll down for video.

Shocking: The video alleges to show Nurmagomedov engaging the baby bear in a series of wrestling holds as they tumble about in the dust egged on by adults and other children

Hampered: The bear appears to fight back as best it can but its movement is hampered by a chain tied around its neck and repeatedly tugged by one of the adult onlookers

Fierce opposition: Khabib Nurmagomedov takes down Pat Healy in their UFC lightweight bout in September. it has been alleged Khabib he is the boy in the video

But it has now been alleged it was through brawling with woodland predators in his home region of Avar, in the North Caucasus of Russia, that he honed his skills as a hardened international prize fighter.

It is alleged Nurmagomedov is the boy in the video, engaging the baby bear in a series of wrestling holds as they tumble about in the dust egged on by adults and other children.

Not a bear fight? The bear does manage to get the youngster in a hold of its own but the boy soon overpowers it

Questions: It is impossible to verify the grainy video, which was filmed on September 23 1997 - three days after Nurmagomedo's ninth birthday

Bear hug: Wearing a red, white and navy blue tracksuit, the boy laughs and the bear takes his jacket in its jaws and pins him down

The bear appears to fight back as best it can but its movement is hampered by a rope tied around its neck and repeatedly tugged by one of the adult onlookers.

Wearing a red, white and navy blue tracksuit, the boy laughs and the bear takes his jacket in its jaws and pins him down.

But the boy overcomes the bear, turning him over to hold it in the same position.

MailOnline has been unable to verify the grainy video, which was filmed on September 23 1997 - three days after Nurmagomedo's ninth birthday.
