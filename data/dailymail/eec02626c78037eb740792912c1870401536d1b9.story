An anonymous donor from Hong Kong has given $1 million to the families of the two NYPD officers shot dead last month.

Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20, 2014, by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide.

On Friday, their grieving families united to receive the gift.

Liu's father Wei Tang Liu will receive $100,000 a year for five years. Ramos' two sons will have $500,000 put into their educational fund.

Grateful: The families told reporters at the ceremony on Friday they are incredibly grateful for the money

Weeping at the ceremony in Manhattan, Wei Tang Liu said in Cantonese that he is very grateful, the New York Daily News reported.

Ramos' widow held her sons' hands tightly before they gathered with Liu's family to hold the check.

'In every tragedy there are individuals who step forward, step up to the plate,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association.

The gift was organized by Chinese daily newspaper Sing Tao, which was approached by the entrepreneur. 

Liu's father Wei Tang will get $100,000 a year for five years. Ramos's sons will receive $500,000 for studies

The money will be paid into the widows' and children's fund run by the police union. 

After speaking to Detective Liu's father, Rep Grace Meng (D-Queens) told the Daily News: 'He's just always expressing gratitude towards everyone for how much they have taken care of him and his whole family.

'He repeatedly, every time I speak to him, reminds us that Officer Liu was his one and only son. One and only child. And so obviously he is very heartbroken.'

'In every tragedy there are individuals who step forward, step up to the plate,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, which will organize the transfer of the donor's funds to the families
