Georgina Beevers was found dead at her home more than 13 hours after her mother warned police she was a suicide risk

A boy of four was left alone with a woman’s body for 13 hours – despite a 999 call to police.

Officers were told the woman, Georgina Beevers, 37, was a suicide risk and had been threatening to take an overdose.

But Greater Manchester Police downgraded the call to a lower priority and an officer who called at the house left when no-one answered the door.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission accused the force of a ‘lack of diligence’  in handling the case. One member of staff has been disciplined.

On January 29 last year, the woman’s mother, Sheila Beevers, 65, made a series of calls to  police and social services warning that Miss Beevers was preparing to overdose on prescription anti-depressants.

Mrs Beevers, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, called police at 6.44pm because she was unable to drive to her daughter’s home herself but no-one was sent round until about 10.25pm.

Miss Beevers’ body was discovered the next morning when officers called again.

The boy then answered the door and they found her body on the sofa.

Naseem Malik, of the IPCC, said the case needed a priority response but ‘didn’t get one due to flawed decision making and a lack of diligence’.

She added: ‘All I can hope is that those involved will learn lessons from this tragedy.’

An inquest gave a verdict of death by misadventure.

Ms Beevers' mother told a police call handler that her daughter was at the 'end of her tether' and her partner had been 'battling with her to stop her taking an overdose'.

Although the 999 was initially treated as urgent and requiring an immediate response, it was later downgraded from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

An officer should still have attended within an hour but due to an ongoing armed robbery and a missing person incident there was no-one available.

The former home (centre) of Ms Beevers, where an officer visited on the night her mother contacted police, but left after there was no answer

The call was assigned to an officer 
at 9.25pm and he visited the house an hour later. But he left after 
getting no response and failed to realise Ms Beevers was a suicide risk 
because he hadn't read the log about the incident properly.

Another officer visited the house at 8.17am the next day and found Ms Beevers' body.

The
Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation concluded
the call should not have been downgraded and the officer who initially 
went to the house had failed to read the log properly, failed to 
understand the nature of the incident and failed to act diligently.

A
radio operator who requested the call be downgraded has received 
'management action' while the police officer had a case to answer for 
misconduct.

The call was downgraded by a supervisor in the control room but neither supervisor accepted responsibility and police systems could not prove which one had taken the decision. Therefore, no action was taken against either supervisor.

IPCC Commissioner Ms Naseem Malik said: 'This was a terribly tragic incident and my deepest condolences go out to Ms Beevers' family. Ms Beevers was vulnerable and in a distressed state.

'Her mother attempted to contact social services and then turned to Greater Manchester Police for help. Despite an excellent, caring response from the initial call handler, the response that followed was inadequate.

'Following Georgina's death we referred this case to the IPCC, who managed an investigation into our handling of this incident. As a result of their findings one officer received management action for breaching the standards of professional behaviour'

- Assistant Chief Constable Zoe Sheard, Greater Manchester Police

'This was an incident that needed a priority response. It didn't get one due to flawed decision making and a lack of diligence.

'We cannot know what difference a prompter response would have made. All I can hope is that those involved will learn lessons from this tragedy.'

Assistant Chief Constable Zoe Sheard, from Greater Manchester Police, said their thoughts were with Ms Beevers' family.

She said: 'We note the verdict of the coroner and will respond positively to her directions.

'Following Georgina's death we referred this case to the IPCC, who managed an investigation into our handling of this incident.

'As a result of their findings one officer received management action for breaching the standards of professional behaviour.

'Our police officers and staff work tirelessly 24/7, 365 days a year to keep communities safe and prevent harm to the public.

'We will continue to work with the family to provide whatever support or assistance we can and are also supporting those officers and members of staff directly involved who have been personally affected by what happened.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
