Arsenal are evaluating the cost of a deal for Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic.

Manager Arsene Wenger is resigned to the fact that Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa is joining Chelsea this summer, while Monaco's Radamel Falcao, who is still recovering from a knee ligament injury, would be an expensive risk.

Scouts have been in Germany continuing to monitor Schalke's Julian Draxler and Nuremberg's promising Josip Drmic but Mandzukic represents the ready-made centre forward.

Target man: Arsenal are weighing up a deal to sign Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic this summer

Reluctant sellers: Bayern are said to want to keep the Croatian forward, but he is after more playing time

Bayern are reluctant to sell but Mandzukic wants regular football and has one year left on his contract.

The 27-year-old came on as a substitute for Thomas Muller against Manchester United and gave Bayern's attack even greater threat. The Croat is clever in his movement, aggressive, technically adept and good in the air.

Mandzukic believes his performances and goals record warrant a regular place in Pep Guardiola's starting line-up but the summer arrival of Robert Lewandowski from Borussia Dortmund will only serve to restrict his game-time further.

David Moyes is also a confirmed fan of Mandzukic having tried to sign him for Everton in the past but Manchester United remain keen on Edinson Cavani at Paris St Germain for now.

Hit list: Sporting Lisbon left-back Marcos Rojo is also on Arsene Wenger's list of potential transfers

Incomings: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be under pressure to reinforce his squad this summer

Meanwhile, Arsenal have checked on Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo.

The
 24-year-old Argentine - who has also been watched by Liverpool, United and 
City - has been booked eight times but has been impressive at 
centre-back during Sporting's rise to second in the Portuguese league 
table. However, he plays left-back for Argentina and that is an added 
attraction for his British suitors who are all seeking to strengthen 
that position.

Everton weigh up Lukaku alternatives due to £25m hurdle

Everton remain in the frame for the 
permanent signing of Romelu Lukaku, but Chelsea's asking price of around 
£25million will be an obvious stumbling block.

Manager
 Roberto Martinez has had scouts monitoring other forwards in Spain and 
Germany with the likes of Carlos Bracca at Sevilla, Loic Remy of QPR and
 Luciano Vietto of Racing Club among names discussed but a permanent 
deal for Lukaku remains his dream ticket.

The
 20-year-old is keen to play in European competition next season and 
Everton's finishing position could prove crucial in terms of standing 
and new finance. Lukaku's camp would prefer to wait until after the 
World Cup when more clubs are anticipated to show an interest.

Options: Everton remain firmly in the hunt to sign Romelu Lukaku, a player they have on loan from Chelsea

In demand: Everton aren't the only club vying for Lukaku - Tottenham are also talking about a deal this summer

The Belgium international's agent Christophe Henrotay has confirmed a conversation has taken place with Tottenham.

Talking
 to Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad, Henrotay said: 'I’m looking for a 
club for Romelu. And yes, I’ve talked to (Spurs chairman) Daniel Levy 
once, but that doesn't mean Romelu will join Spurs. That's not a talking
 point at this moment.'

Although
 Chelsea are reputed to want an option on Everton midfielder Ross 
Barkley in any negotiations for Lukaku, the 20-year-old Barkley is keen 
to stay at Everton and further his development under Martinez. Contract 
talks are expected in the summer.

No deal: Everton are adamant that any deal with Chelsea for Lukaku wouldn't include Ross Barkley

Crystal Palace will rival Sunderland in a renewed battle for Will Buckley this summer.

Both
 clubs showed an interest in the Brighton winger in January and will 
resume talks over a £3million deal at the end of the season.

Sunderland
 were rebuffed in two bids for Buckley before settling on a deal for his
 team-mate Liam Bridcutt, who was considered the greater priority by 
manager Gus Poyet.

Sporting director Lee Congerton wants a
 more British-themed recruitment policy to Sunderland's transfers and at
 24 years-of-age Buckley fits into that profile along with the likes of Hamburg's 
Michael Mancienne.

Palace 
manager Tony Pulis could be in a stronger position to tempt Buckley with
 his side favourites at this stage to stay up, although Pulis himself 
will be in demand following his exploits at Selhurst Park.

Leicester, meanwhile, are among clubs to have shown an interest in Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

Martin Skrtel's agent has dismissed the prospect of the Liverpool defender moving to Napoli in the summer.

Skrtel
 has revived his career at Anfield after being on the brink of leaving, 
with his former boss Rafa Benitez keen to take him to Serie A.

However,
 the Slovakian's agent Karol Csonto said: 'There is no chance for Skrtel
 to go to Napoli. What I can say is that Martin Skrtel will not go to 
Napoli. Skrtel will remain at Liverpool.'

Staying put: Martin Skrtel's agent has said the Liverpool stopper will not be leaving Anfield this summer

Napoli do remain strong candidates to sign Pepe Reina on a permanent deal.

Meanwhile,
 representatives of Napoli's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami are 
understood to have spoken to Tottenham to gauge interest. The 
28-year-old is keen on a move to England.

Halifax's
 very own livewire striker Lee Gregory will be looking to impress 
tonight against Braintree Town in the crucial Conference League clash.

A
 win for either side would put them into the play-off positions and 
Gregory will be looking to add to his tally of 28 goals in 31 games this
 season.

Staff from 
Blackburn, Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester, Barnsley and 
Millwall are all due at the game to watch the 25-year-old striker who 
has scored seven in his last four games.

Gregory,
 who finishes his shift with his electrical company at 3pm before 
heading off for his pre-match meal, is eager to impress and earn his 
chance of a transfer to a league club as well as propel Halifax closer 
to promotion.

Sevilla are rekindling interest in Fulham forward Bryan Ruiz. The Spanish side were among clubs interested in signing Ruiz in January prior to the 28-year-old joining PSV Eindhoven in a £1m loan deal.

He is rediscovering his best form in Holland and has scored four goals in 10 games to keep talented teenager Zakaria Bakkali out of Philip Cocu's first team.

Sevilla, who are expected to lose the goal threat of midfielder Ivan Rakitic to Real Madrid in the summer, sent scouts to run the rule over Ruiz last week.

Cardiff City are in talks over a £1.5million deal for for Beira-Mar striker Willyan.

The clubs have been in discussions over a possible partnership and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recognises the potential in the 20-year-old Brazilian.

Full name Willyan Barbosa, he has an Italian passport which would clear any work permit problems. Formerly with Torino he joined Beira-Mar on loan and only joined on a permanent deal in January.

Anderlecht's highly-coveted defender Wout Faes has agreed a contract with the club after turning 16.

Manchester United and Chelsea scouts watched the Belgium U17 international defender in action in the European Championship qualifiers in Scotland last week and will monitor his progress.
