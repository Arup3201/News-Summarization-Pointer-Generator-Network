In a year that has already brought the death of America’s most-wanted terrorist, news of Muammar al-Gaddafi’s capture and death proves one can still shock Hillary Clinton.

Mrs Clinton was preparing for interviews in Kabul, Afghanistan, when top aide Huma Abedin handed her a BlackBerry with the first news of Muammar Gaddafi’s capture.

'Wow,' the secretary of state exclaims. ‘Unconfirmed reports about Gaddafi being captured.’

She then hands the phone back to Abedin, the wife of disgraced lawmaker Anthony Weiner.

As others hover around her, she reminds them the report is not yet confirmed, saying, 'We’ve had a bunch of those before.

'We've had him captured a couple of times.'

In Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama said the rule of an 'iron fist' in Libya has come to an end.

At a press conference today in the White House rose garden, Mr Obama said: 'The dictator is no more.'

He added: 'This is a momentous day in the history of Libya as a dark shadow of tyranny has been lifted. Now the people of Libya have a great responsibility.'

Kind words: President Obama commended the Libyan people in a speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, saying that they rose up and demanded their rights

Earlier, Vice President Joe Biden said the Libyan people have now 'got a 
chance' with him gone.

And
 he said the Obama administration made the right decision in playing a 
secondary role to other NATO allies in the seven-month Libya campaign.

 Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain called the Libyan
 dictator's death 'an end to the first phase of the Libyan revolution.'

Although the U.S. briefly led the NATO bombing campaign in Libya that sealed Gadhafi's fate, Washington later took a secondary role to its allies. Britain and France said they hoped that his death would lead to a more democratic Libya.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said it would allow Libyans 'to free themselves from the dictatorial and violent regime.'

Presidential contender Mitt Romney was the first to weigh in on Gaddafi's death among the Republicans hoping to unseat Obama next year.

The former Massachusetts governor tweeted: 'Muammar al-Qaddafi was a tyrant who terrorized the Libyan people and shed American blood and the world is a better place without him'

Herman Cain also took to Twitter, saying: 'Gaddafi is gone, that's good. Now the question is: What's next?'

Mrs Clinton was in Libya just two days ago to praise leaders of the revolt against Gaddafi's forces, as well as to pledge the U.S.'s support.

The secretary of state is no stranger to being photographed in tense moments.

Her reaction stood out in the iconic White House photo of President Obama and his top advisers watching live footage of the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.

Mrs Clinton can be seen with her hand to her mouth in what looked like anxiety over the outcome of the operation.

But Mrs Clinton later said her expression may have been nothing more than her efforts to stifle a cough.

She said on May 5: 'I am somewhat sheepishly concerned that it was my preventing one of my early spring allergic coughs.

'So it may have no great meaning whatsoever.'
