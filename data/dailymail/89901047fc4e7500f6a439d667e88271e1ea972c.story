In her over-sized designer sunglasses, sparkling diamond earrings and full make-up, Katherine Jenkins looks ready for a red carpet appearance.

In fact, this was the Welsh mezzo-soprano before taking part in yesterday’s marathon.

Only four days after she raised eyebrows at Baroness Thatcher’s funeral in a plunging cocktail-style dress, the 32-year-old joined thousands of runners for the 26.2mile race and looked every inch the celebrity.

Her blonde hair was pulled back in an immaculate ponytail, her smile was a dazzling white, her lip gloss was a glistening pink and she wore what appeared to be false eyelashes.

Miss Jenkins ran in aid of Macmillan cancer support in memory of her father Selwyn, who died from lung cancer when his daughter was 15.

Before the race she posed for photographers, proudly showing a picture of her father on her T-shirt.

But as soon as the photocall was over, Miss Jenkins got down to business, putting on her £200 Prada sunglasses and her headphones ready to listen to the marathon play-list installed on the iPod attached to her arm.

Miss Jenkins, who hardly seemed to break a sweat during the race, crossed the finish line with a time of five hours and 26 minutes.

The singer, who has already raised more than £22,000 for charity, said: ‘I wanted to run it in support  of Macmillan.

‘My father passed away from  cancer when I was 15 and the  Macmillan nurses came and they  were wonderful.’ 

She added: ‘I really don’t think of myself as an athletic person at all. I never in a million years thought I would do this. I’m glad that I am, but I am nervous.’ Miss Jenkins, who wore a black ribbon pinned to her green running vest in memory of those killed and injured in the Boston bombings, said that she wanted to show solidarity with those affected in the US.

‘Like everyone else, it was just so devastating to see that on the news,’ she said. ‘But I think we all feel more than ever that we want to do this and show our support  for Boston.’
