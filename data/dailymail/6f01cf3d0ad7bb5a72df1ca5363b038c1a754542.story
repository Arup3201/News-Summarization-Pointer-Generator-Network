After a blistering start, England were forced to work for their win against Scotland, which took them level on points with Ireland and Wales at the top of the Six Nations championship table.

Jonathan Joseph had Stuart Lancaster's side ahead inside five minutes, but Scotland fought back and forced a thrilling finale.

Sportsmail's Chris Foy was there to run the rule over the two teams:

Courtney Lawes gets up above Jonny Gray to secure line-out ball for England in a hard-fought battle

ENGLAND

Mike Brown – Ominous when he dropped first high kick but settled well and posed a threat whenever he had the ball. 7.

Anthony Watson – A game of near-triumph for him, but he scored a ‘try’ which was ruled out, as was another he helped set up. 7. 

Mike Brown takes on Finn Russell as the England full back looked to create opportunities

Jonathan Joseph – Took his try with typical, swerving aplomb, to showcase his nifty footwork. Held up well in defence. 7.

Luther Burrell – Squandered glorious early scoring chance. Forceful as ever, but not igniting this campaign as he did last year. 6.

Jack Nowell – Exeter wing was electric with his broken-field running. Some suspect decision-making but good finish for try. 7. 

Jonathan Joseph dives over to score England's early try, which looked to have set them on their way

George Ford – His authority grows. Created openings with distribution and pace, and scored a try. All was well until late missed kicks. 8.

Ben Youngs – Was a livewire threat early on and continued to test the Scottish defence with his darts around the fringes. 7.

Joe Marler – Deft handling in run-up to Ford try, put in familiar busy shift in defence and was at the heart of set-piece onslaught. 7.

George Ford dives over the line for his try in a game where he contributed 15 points and controlled the play

Dylan Hartley – This was a fast-and-loose encounter, so his work in the tight was most felt with his part in a first-half scrum blitz. 6.

Dan Cole – The Leicester tighthead is quite content to win scrums and hit rucks, in which case he was in his element here. 7.

Dave Attwood – Not as prominent as he was in Dublin, when his defensive work was so valuable and not among top carriers. 6. 

Dave Attwood gets the ball away out of the tackle as England in another good display from the second row

Courtney Lawes – Largely effective in the way he orchestrated the lineout and a dynamic, punishing presence around the field. 7.

James Haskell – Made his fair share of tackles but no major carrying or breakdown impact. His place may be under threat. 6.

Billy Vunipola – Determination to impose himself was clear from sheer number of times he pounded the Scottish defence. 7.

Billy Vunipola goes on one of his characteristic runs as he offers England some momentum 

Chris Robshaw – Not a towering presence before the break, but more influential later, especially as a link-man in attacks. 7.

Replacements: Tom Youngs exploded from the bench to provide impetus and fellow front-rower, Kieran Brookes, was involved in the build-up to Nowell’s try and Tom Wood made one strong late burst.

Chris Robshaw needs two Scottish tacklers to bring him down as he led England to a Calcutta Cup victory

SCOTLAND

Stuart Hogg – Did well to chase back and prevent a try by Brown. Frustrated by restricted chances and threw some wild passes. 6.

Dougie Fife – Had a couple of jinking bursts but largely well shackled. Covered effectively when Watson threatened in second half. 5. 

Stuart Hogg goes low to bring down Jack Nowell but Scotland couldn't hold out for long

Mark Bennett – Kept his head when the chance came; ignoring men outside to touch down. Largely occupied with tackling. 7.

Matt Scott – Was an emergency replacement for Alex Dunbar and this wasn’t a day for him to prove his creative credentials. 5.

Tommy Seymour – A regular threat. He came in-field looking for work and often found gaps. Kept choosing clever lines. 7.

Finn Russell – Was all at sea in the first quarter but grew into the game. Some shrewd touches but also some glaring lapses. 6. 

Finn Russell looks for territory as the Scots struggled to get good field position to make a late charge

Greig Laidlaw – Behind a beaten pack, he struggled to control proceedings and didn’t challenge England with box-kicks. 6.

Alasdair Dickinson – The prop was damned by association with a scrum effort which was hapless as England took command. 5.

Ross Ford – He has had far more commanding outings than this, as he failed to make many dents in a pack on the back foot. 5.

Euan Murray – After early tussle with Dan Cole, was left flailing as George Ford scored his try and couldn’t prevent scrum rout. 5.

Greig Laidlaw kicks clear as Courtney Lawes attempts to get through two Scottish forwards to charge down

Jim Hamilton – It wasn’t his day. Took a blow to the head that led to an early exit and not the usual snarling menace. 5.

Jonny Gray – Nearly touched down when the Scots finally gained a foothold. Couldn’t disrupt English supply at the lineout. 6.

Rob Harley – Had a hand in the try scored by Bennett but against the big, strong home forwards he was a lightweight presence. 5.

David Denton – Last year, he was almost a lone threat to England and this time he again fought the good fight in vain. 7.

Jonny Gray carries the ball as Scotland fought back from a poor start to make a game of it

Blair Cowan – Aside from one slick aerial off-load to send Seymour hurtling clear, he was a low-profile figure in this game. 5.

Replacements: The lack of Scottish depth was harshly exposed. None of them sent on from the bench by Vern Cotter could do anything to turn the tide against their team.
