Virtual currency Bitcoin could be regulated in Britain to make it easier and safer to use, George Osborne signalled today.

The Chancellor said the world of finance 'is changing in front of our eyes' and laws had to keep pace with technology.

A major review will examine how alternative payment systems could be used to boost the economy and help shoppers in Britain.

Unlike traditional currencies like the pound or dollar, Bitcoin exists outside the control of any central banks or laws.

Instead it is traded entirely online, often anonymously, leading to its association with the internet drugs market.

It is also volatile, with its value 18 months ago just £8 and increasing to more than £645 late last year. It now trades at £352.

But now it is gaining credence as a viable alternative for the costly wire transfers of an estimated £350 billion in remittances to families in the developing world.

In a speech on how to bolster the FinTech sector, Mr Osborne said: 'The world of finance as we know it is changing in front of our eyes.

'I can today announce that the Government will start a major programme of work exploring the potential of virtual currencies and digital money.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer 
digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as 
the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Miners operate the computers that keep 
track of bitcoins and create additional coins. They pool their computing
 power to spread the financial risk of their operations.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

The value of bitcoins has fallen six per 
cent in a week to around $600 (£354), although the decline is within the range of normal 
fluctuations for the volatile currency.

A
 bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than 
half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four 
years.

'These alternative payment systems are popular because they are quick, cheap, and convenient – and I want to see whether we can make more use of them for the benefit of the UK economy and British consumers.'

Aides to the Chancellor stressed that any move to regulate Bitcoin would be designed to make it easier and safer for people to use, rather than to drive it out of Britain.

Mr Osborne added: 'I want to be alert to the risks that accompany any new technology.'

The review will 'look into whether regulation of the sector is required, so that virtual currency business can continue to set up in the UK, and for people and businesses to use them safely', he said.

As part of the other measures new rules will force banks that reject loans for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to ask the firms whether they want to be referred to alternative lenders, including crowd-funders, peer-to-peer lenders and invoice financiers.

Mr Osborne said: 'Key to the Government's long term economic plan is cementing Britain's position as the centre of global finance.

'That's why I'm delighted to announce a series of major steps today to help our FinTech firms continue to grow and succeed.'

Britain's alternative finance market is expected to be worth £1.6bn in 2014, the Treasury said.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Forcing banks to refer businesses to alternative lenders is something I've been determined to make happen.

'It's good that more SMEs are making use of alternative finance but the big banks still dominate and small businesses often give up if they're turned down for finance by their bank.

'The UK needs a diverse and competitive business finance market like Germany and the US if our SMEs are to thrive, and that is why the Business Bank is so important.

'Money is already reaching small businesses, but my ambition for the Business Bank is to radically alter the overall market landscape.'

Other measures announced included a consultation on digital communications, a review of the part technology will play in the future of the FinTech sector, a £100 million extension to investment for smaller businesses, a push to promote Britain in overseas markets and awards for those who come up with solutions to help small businesses access finance.
