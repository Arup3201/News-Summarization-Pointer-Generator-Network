Tragic: Imam Sheik Abdullah was killed during an attack carried out against a mosque with a petrol bomb in Anderlecht

A Belgian mosque leader was killed last night as he tried to save a worshipper set alight in a brutal petrol bomb attack.

Father-of-four Abdullah Dadou, 46, died from smoke inhalation after a man burst into a Shiite mosque in the Brussels suburb of Anderlecht at 7pm.

Witnesses said the man, who had no ID
 papers, turned up at the building, pulled out a knife and axe, poured 
petrol over the floor and then set it alight.

He then shouted Sunni slogans - sparking speculation that the attack was linked to tensions between them and the Shiites.

Worshippers detained him and locked him in a room before he was arrested.

But Adbullah failed to escape, and remained trapped in the blaze.

The man was arrested - a Muslim who said he was born in 1978.

No other 
people are being sought in connection with the attack, which also injured one other person.

As investigators sought to determine whether the arson attack was an isolated incident or a deliberate assault on the Shiite community, Belgium's Interior Minister Joelle Milquet suggested inter-religious strife may be to blame.

She said: 'This person went in (the mosque) hurling statements linked to the Syrian conflict. It appears to be a problem between Sunnis and Shiites.

'Belgium will not tolerate this type of act and the importing of this type of conflict on its territory.'

Islam's Sunni and Shiite movements have fuelled violence in several Muslim countries, from Iraq to Yemen and Pakistan.

The area around the Brussels mosque, one of four Shiite centres of worship in the city's overwhelming majority Sunni Muslim community, has a large immigrant Muslim population.

Azzedine Laghmich, an official at the mosque, said the attacker was 'a Salafist', who sprayed petrol inside the mosque before setting it alight and shouting Sunni slogans on his way out - cries related to the conflict in Syria.

Isabelle Praile, another senior official in Belgium's Muslim community, said the mosque 'had already been placed under police protection several years ago,' because of threats from members of the ultra-conservative Salafist movement.

More than 100 men gathered near the Rida mosque after the fire, shouting Shiite slogans behind a police tape as some prayed and others hugged or cried over the death of imam Abdallah Dadou, a 46-year-old father-of-four.

'I brought my eight-year-old son here with me so that he can see blind hate, what it can do,' said Ismael Ben Mohammad, 40.

The mayor of the city's Anderlecht ward, Gaetan Van Goidsenhoven, appealed for calm at an overnight press conference, saying it was 'not only necessary to live side-by-side, but also to allow justice and the police to do their work.'

The imam was described by worshipper Abdel Adouzeyneb, a 39-year-old real estate agent, as 'a person who was loved by everybody -- he was open, well integrated, smiling and happy.'Â

Anxious: People wait in the street after the petrol bomb attack. A witness saw a man setting fire to the mosque in Anderlecht, killing the mosque's imam Sheik Abdullah and injuring another person.

Prosecutor Jean-Marc Meilleur said the arson suspect was detained by police after people inside locked him inside the mosque.

'At the moment, there is only one suspect,' Meilleur said, adding that it was too soon to know whether it was a one-man attack or a wider plot.

The last time an imam was targeted in Brussels was in 1989 when Saudi-born Abdullah Muhammad al-Ahdal was shot dead.

He served as imam in the Grand Mosque of Brussels and was killed on March of that year by an armed man inside the mosque.

His killing was claimed by a small pro-Iranian group in Lebanon who accused him of being too moderate and of having rejected the death fatwa slapped on writer Salman Rushdie.
