Bayern Munich’s wing wonder Xherdan Shaqiri has declared that a move to Juventus would be hard to turn down.

The Swiss star’s stock increased off the back of an impressive World Cup campaign, with the 22-year-old netting a hat-trick in his country’s final group game against Honduras.

On the move? Xhedran Shaqiri has said an offer from Serie A champions Juventus would be hard to reject

However, he has found opportunities hard to come by at Bayern, with him only appearing in 17 league games last season, finding the goal on six occasions.

This has seen him linked to numerous clubs this summer, notably Liverpool, but Italian champions Juventus – who appointed Massimiliano Allegri as manager last week following Antonio Conte’s resignation – have also joined the running for him.

In an interview with Tuttosport, the Swiss star stated: 'Juventus would definitely be a nice option.

'Juventus are a big club, who wouldn't want to play for them... I don't think Juventus would be a step back in my career.

'But I am on holiday at the moment. My brother is occupying himself with my future.

'I don't know whether Juventus have been in touch with Bayern. I have not heard anything about it from Juventus or Bayern.'
