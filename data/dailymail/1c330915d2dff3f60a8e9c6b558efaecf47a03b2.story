Real Madrid were keeping their cards close to their chest regarding potential deadline-day transfers amid speculation of a possible swoop for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez.

Madrid, who sold Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso recently, have been linked with a move for Monaco star Radamel Falcao while there was speculation they were looking to bring in Mexico forward Hernandez on loan.

However, neither Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti nor director Emilio Butragueno were giving anything away following the team's shock 4-2 La Liga defeat at Real Sociedad on sunday night.

Cashing in: Angel di Maria went from Real Madrid to Manchester United last month

Ancelotti, whose side led 2-0 after 11 minutes against Sociedad only to leave Anoeta empty-handed, said: 'This defeat changes nothing regarding the transfer market. It's our problem, of concentration. We have to work much harder not to make these mistakes.

'Something has to change and it's going to change.'

Meanwhile, Butragueno, the director of institutional relations at Madrid, said: 'There are 24 hours left and if there's something new Madrid will announce it. There's nothing to add or deny.'

Target: Radamel Falcao is said to be another player Madrid are interested in
