A wealthy Chinese businessman has been jailed for 13 years for hiring poachers to kill three tigers so he could eat their penises and drink their blood.

China's official Xinhua news agency said Xi Pat had 'a special hobby of grilling tiger bones, boning tiger paws, storing tiger penis, eating tiger meat and drinking tiger blood alcohol'.

A court heard he ate the genitals and drank the animals' blood before giving the rest of the meat to his business friends and partners.

Xi Pat has been jailed for killiing and eating three tigers - he was caught out when one of his accomplices filmed the entire process with his mobile phone (pictured). The footage was later obtained by police

The court heard he organised three separate trips last year for 15 people, including himself, to Leizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, where they bought tigers for a 'huge amount of money' that were killed and dismembered as they watched.

One of the group filmed the entire process of a tiger slaughter with his mobile phone. The footage was later obtained by police.

Police then seized eight pieces of animal meat and bones from a refrigerator in Xi Pat's home, some of which were later identified as tiger parts, including a penis.

The police report added exotic meats including gecko and cobra were also found in the fridge.

A court in Guangxi convicted the 15 of 'illegally transporting precious and endangered wild animal products'.

The court heard Xi Pat insisted on the big cats being caught alive so when they were killed they could be bled and he was able to drink the blood.  

A court heard Xi Pat had eaten at least three tiger penises and drunk 'several litres of tiger blood' 

The court heard Xi Pat had eaten at least three tiger penises and drunk 'several litres of tiger blood'.

Prosecutors claim the illegal poaching operation saw at least 10 tigers being killed and eaten. 

They said that the tigers had been killed by electrocution so that the hide could be removed and used to create trophies that were handed out to his friends.

Xi Pat was sentenced to 13 years in prison and handed a fine of 1.55 million yuan ($25,000), gxnews.com.cn said, with the others were jailed for terms between five and six and a half years.

Tiger meat is not only sought after on the black market but is often used in Chinese medicine. 

It is a long-held belief across parts of Asia that penises of animals such as tigers and seals can boost men's sexual performance. 

Decades of trafficking and habitat destruction have slashed the tiger population from 100,000 a century ago to approximately 3,000, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species, where the tiger is classed as endangered.
