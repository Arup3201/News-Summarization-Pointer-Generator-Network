Injured friends of a student nurse who died in a minibus crash as they all travelled to a hen party joined hundreds of other mourners for her funeral today.

Beth Jones, 18, died in the collision between the bus and a lorry on the M62 near Pontefract in West Yorkshire in April.

Today, many of Miss Jones's friends who were injured in the crash were in tears as they waited for the cortege to arrive outside St Joseph's Church, in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire.

Miss Jones's parents, Diane and Paul, led the mourners along with her boyfriend, Nathan Hurcomb.

Diane Jones was also injured in the crash and she walked into the church with the aid of crutches.

Miss Jones's sister, Amy, was in a wheelchair.

Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, walked into the church still wearing a neck brace, supported by her fiance Gary Leafe.  

The pair had been due to get married in the fortnight after the crash, but have postponed their wedding.

Mr Leafe's mother Lesley was also seriously injured in the crash.

The women were travelling from South Elmsall, between Doncaster and Wakefield, for the hen night in Liverpool.

Twenty women on the bus were hurt, eight of them seriously.

Ryan Jones led tributes to his sister during the 90-minute service.

Reading a message from their sister, Amy, he said: 'My beautiful baby sister.

'I can't begin the explain, that I had the most amazing sister in the whole wide world, my best friend forever.

'I will never forget you. We were the same on the inside and out. Love you always, your big sister.'

And reading a message from their father, he said: 'My little girl - not just beautiful on the outside but stunning on the inside.'

He added: 'Beth could light up any room with her smile and warmth. A true diamond.

'Forever in my heart and thoughts, love Dad.'

Miss Jones's cousin, Becca Thompson, told the packed church her friend was a 'fun, caring, happy-go-lucky girl who would always wear a smile to brighten up any day'.

She said Miss Jones was the 'big sister I never had - my best friend'.

The service was relayed by speakers to mourners who gathered outside the packed church.

Many of those waiting were wearing pink clothes and sporting pink flowers.

A choir from St Wilfrid's Catholic High School, where Miss Jones studied, sang Purify My Heart, I'm Giving You My Heart and I Watch The Sunrise.

The service ended with the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful and was followed by a private cremation nearby.

Miss Jones, who would have celebrated her 19th birthday last Monday, was in the first year of a nursing course at Leeds University.

She died in the crash that happened close to one of the off-slips of junction 32 of the motorway. The lorry involved was travelling in the same direction.

Firefighters who attended the battered minibus said the scene was one of the worst they had ever seen.

In a statement after the crash, Miss 
Jones' family said: 'Beth was a fun and bubbly girl who was caring and 
considerate to everyone she met.

'She was the apple of her grandad's eye and she will never be forgotten and sadly missed by everyone.'

The family has asked for donations to Beth's Angels, a fund to raise money for those affected by the crash, which has already raised £12,000.

Many of the mourners, including Beth's sister Amy, wore pink and carried pink flowers in tribute

The fund was set up by her cousin Mark Larkin, the landlord of the Barnsley Oak pub, where Miss Jones worked.

He said: 'I knew a lot of people had started raising money for the air ambulance after the crash but I thought we needed to do something for the girls who are going to be out of work for a long time while they recover.

'Also, we wanted to support Beth's family while they look after her older sister Amy, who was also injured and was the last one to leave hospital.'

The driver of the minibus, Jimmy Johnson, 62, from Bradford, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving last week. He was bailed pending further inquiries.

Lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 43, was arrested and bailed following the crash.

Another crash victim, Sarah Johnson, was pictured being wheeled into church today
