A California woman is asking the thieves who stole her mother's urn to return the ashes, no questions asked, after her house was robbed last week.

Vanessa Llanas of Hesperia went on vacation earlier this month to attend a family member's wedding and returned to find her house had been ransacked.

The robbers stole a TV, electronics and other valuables, but also took the urn containing her mother's ashes.

Llanas' mother Yolanda Molina Bedoy died at the age of 50 in 2011 from Lupus, and her family didn't bury her body since she said she always wanted to be in the house with her grandchildren.

The robber or robbers came in through Llanas' bedroom window and left the house in disarray, exiting with their loot through the back door and the urn they grabbed from Llanas' closet.

'I don’t understand how a robber would want it. What are you going to do with it? It’s a body. You have to have some type of heart,' she told KCAL.

She has since filled out a police report, hoping the ashes will be tracked down and returned.

She has also released a statement to the robbers, pleading with them to simply return the urn anonymous.

'Just drop her off in front of the porch,' Llanas told NBC Southern California. 'No questions asked.'

She says her greatest fear is that the ashes have been dumped and the thieves have tried to sell the urn.

Some of her stolen property was reportedly found in a dumpster in Victorville.
