They are among our most commonly seen birds, doing nothing more extraordinary than looking for food in an unremarkable back garden.

Frozen in flight by the camera, however, they become creatures of spectacular grace and beauty.

In a fraction of a second, these incredible photographs capture the everyday activity of robins, tits, finches and other native species in a way the human eye never could.

They transform the simplest manoeuvre into an aerial ballet; show tiny wings in majestic, intricate detail. They also give a rare glimpse of the fierce competition for food and territorial supremacy in the avian kingdom.

These two goldfinches were captured during an amazingly complex flight display as they almost danced most serenely in the air while they were out feeding 

These robins seem to have a difference of opinion as they perch on a rusting metal pole in a back garden. The moment was captured by photographer John Crabb

John Crabb wanted to be able to capture the images of birds in free-frame while they are in mid-air without scaring the birds, which was a major task

But just how does a photographer get close enough to freeze-frame the mid-air action in perfect focus, without scaring the birds?

Simple, if you happen to be retired physicist and lifelong gadget enthusiast Dr John Crabb. He might have bought his first camera only four years ago, but his enthusiasm for Heath Robinson-style solutions to challenging problems has rapidly allowed his new-found hobby to take flight.

Hence, it was a succession of wacky looking, home-made devices that allowed him get the perfect shot. The first was nothing more complex than a twig attached to a post, wired up to trigger the camera shutter when a bird launched itself from the perch.

The Mk II version was a spring-loaded feeding platform (it looks a little like a medieval siege-engine catapult) — rigged up with a switch that operates an electrical circuit connected to the camera.

Dr Crabb had to go back to the drawing board after a cheeky robin bounced up and down so excitedly on the platform, it produced hundreds of frames of an empty patch of air. The camera was focused on the spot where the robin should have flown; instead, the bouncing bird kept triggering the shutter without actually taking off.

The retired physicist designed an ingenious method of capturing the perfect image of the bird every time without scaring the subject

Dr Crabb used his scientific know-how to attach a trigger to a twig with a pressure switch, when the bird launched itself from branch it set off the camera

So in the weeks and months that followed, the devices were refined with infra-red or laser beams that fired the camera when the beam was broken by a bird or its shadow. Result: a portfolio of stunningly clear photographs revealing the hidden beauty of birds in the early stages of flight, fighting each other, and feeding their young.

Yesterday Dr Crabb explained: ‘The main point of all the geekery was, of course the photos, and some of them turned out astonishingly well. They show aspects of flight that would otherwise be unobservable — people tell me they have never seen birds flying like that before.

All of them are just ordinary garden birds, so much overlooked. But to catch them in dramatic flight really pleases me. Even the smallest ones look more magnificent than I could have expected. With their fully spread wings, they look every bit as impressive as eagles. You can see these birds every day, but the images give a new insight into what they actually look like.’

The photographs were all taken in natural light in Dr Crabb’s back garden in Somerset, then posted on a wildlife website he created to showcase them. Needless to say, he’s also on Twitter.

Dr Crabb said he was concentrating on ordinary garden birds that he had seen out of the back of his Somerset home but was able to capture the most amazing images 

Dr Crabb captured images which are normally missed of birds landing and taking off or fighting with each other
