Thousands of bat carcasses continue to litter the streets of a small town in New South Wales after an extreme heatwave caused the flying mammals to die in droves. 

Up to 5000 dead flying foxes are estimated to have died at Casino in northern New South Wales according to the Northern Star, as temperatures soared to 44 degrees over the weekend.

However, amongst those saved by wildlife rescue organisation WIRES and other groups, were hundreds of baby bats most of which were less than one month old.

Up to 5000 flying foxes are believed to have died over the weekend due to an extreme heat wave

A spokesperson for Wires explained that 'the extreme heat, low humidity and lack of shade' too early in the season, led to the mass deaths.

By 1pm on Saturday, the first flying foxes began falling to the ground after dying in their trees.

'Female flying foxes have young this time of the year and hundreds of babies were clinging to their dead mothers on the ground,' a WIRES spokesperson said.

'Each of these orphans had to be assessed, hydrated and taken care of individually.'

The streets of Casino, in northern New South Wales, are still being cleared of the carcasses after temperatures soared to 44 degrees on Saturday 

'The task is ongoing; carers are working round the clock and emotions are tested as carers do what they can to ensure each and every little flying fox is taken care of whilst dealing with the sight of thousands of adults and juveniles dead and dying.' 

Approximately 450 flying fox pups were rescued by volunteers, according to the Northern Star.

The Rural Fire service sprayed trees with water over the weekend in an effort to help cool any surviving bats; however temperatures have since cooled in the small town.

Carcases continue to be cleared from the neighbourhood by the local council who have also issued health warnings.

About 450 baby bats less than one month old, which were found clinging to their dead mothers, have been saved by wildlife organisation WIRES

'Some areas along the riverbank are inaccessible and the stench from the rotting carcasses will be quite unbearable for some time yet,' John Walker, the general manager of Richmond Valley Council, said.

'People should avoid the area and not try to help living bats themselves as they could bite and scratch and some carry the lyssavirus.'

'Young children could be attracted to the bats on the ground but there could be serious health risks if they pick them up,' Mr Walker said.
