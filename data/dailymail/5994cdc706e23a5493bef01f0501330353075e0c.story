A man has been accused of murdering two vulnerable pensioners who lived 120 miles apart.

Leo Barnes, 32, is suspected of killing 80-year-old Cynthia Beamond and Philip Silverstone, 67.

The bodies of the victims, who are not related, were found within 24 hours of each other in the West Midlands and London.

Yesterday, Barnes appeared before magistrates accused of double murder.

In the dock alongside him was his girlfriend, Chantelle Moran-Stokes, 24, who is accused of murdering Mrs Beamond.

The
 glamorous blonde sat just a foot from her partner but stared straight 
ahead without acknowledging him during the brief hearing.

Friends
 said Barnes is well-known for driving a Porsche and for his love of 
powerful cars.

He has posted numerous pictures of garishly-painted 
supercars on his Facebook, alongside images of luxury brands and London 
landmarks.

His girlfriend has posted dozens of pictures of herself online posing with friends at Birmingham nightclubs.

The
 police investigation began when worried family members reported Mrs 
Beamond missing in Halesowen, West Midlands, last Friday.

The grandmother-of-two’s battered body was eventually discovered concealed inside the semi-detached property on Sunday evening.

A post mortem examination found the widow, who has two daughters, died from head injuries inflicted during a vicious attack.

Mrs
 Beamond’s T-registration Vauxhall Astra was later found abandoned in 
the Druids Heath area of Birmingham after a tip-off from a member of the
 public.

Meanwhile, police 
in London found Mr Silverstone’s body at his flat in Belsize Park, North
 West London, on Monday morning after being alerted by relatives.

The
 former market trader had suffered a number of stab wounds at Spencer 
House, which is in a warden-controlled block for the elderly.

Investigators believe he was murdered around midnight on Saturday.

They
 originally arrested his second wife Mary, who is in poor health and in a
 wheelchair, but quickly released her without charge. She is more than 
15 years older than him.

Detectives
 are investigating whether Mrs Silverstone witnessed the murder of her 
husband of 36 years in their top-floor flat at the four-storey Georgian 
townhouse.

Neighbours described Mr Silverstone as a ‘gentle’ man and a ‘Del Boy character’, who was devoted to his wife.

Barnes, a father-of-one, and Moran-Stokes were arrested on Sunday morning by West Midlands Police murder squad detectives.

Barnes was questioned over the London murder on Tuesday evening after Metropolitan Police detectives discovered a link.

According to housing records, he is a former neighbour of Mr Silverstone and lived in the same block for several years.

The unusual circumstances have led West Midlands Police and the Met to form a joint investigation.

Self-employed Barnes, of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, appeared at Dudley Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

Wearing a black T-shirt, he refused to give or confirm his name, address and date of birth to the court clerk.

Moran-Stokes,
 of Darlaston, West Midlands, spoke only to confirm her name, address 
and date of birth during the five-minute hearing.

The pair were remanded in custody and ordered to appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court today.
