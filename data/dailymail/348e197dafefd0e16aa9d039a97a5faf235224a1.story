 

The house where the infamous 'Hackney
 Mole Man' constructed an elaborate labyrinth of tunnels underneath his 
London home is going under the hammer.

Eccentric William Lyttle, a retired civil engineer, spent 40 years digging 60 foot-long passages below his property.

Now the house in east London's Hackney area is expected to fetch around £750,000 when it goes up for auction next month.

Planning permission to knock the house down and replace it with two town houses - with basements has now been granted.

Lyttle died at the age of 79 two years ago, leaving a £408,000 bill for his four decade long underground campaign.

He was evicted from the house in 2006 'for his own safety' after Hackney Council discovered his exploits.

They found skiploads of junk 
including the wrecks of four Renault 4 cars, a boat, scrap metal, old 
baths, fridges and dozens of TV sets stashed in the tunnels.

Mr Lyttle was then put up in a hotel for three years, at a
 cost to the taxpayer £45,000, before being re-housed in a nearby 
council-owned property.

Towards the end of his life the reclusive pensioner battled to keep his mole tunnels preserved, but after his death 
council workers filled in the tunnels with concrete for safety reasons.

It is now surrounded by high fences and most of the tunnels have been filled reports The Independent.

The building went on sale last year for around £500,000 but no deal resulted.

'Putting the property  up for auction
 is the best option to achieve the maximum property price' said Sean 
King of estate agent Move with Us.

'We expect lots of interest in the 
sale. The property is prime real estate in Hackney with the added cachet
 of being the 'Mole Man's former house.'
