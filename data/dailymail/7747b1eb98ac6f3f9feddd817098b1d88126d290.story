Posing topless in his bright red shorts and proudly displaying his pierced nipple, the police officer caught on video striking an unarmed woman advertises the fact that he is a 'sexy single' man with a racy photo-shoot for a Philadelphia newspaper.

Patrol Lt. Jonathan D. Josey II, 40, nominated himself to be the Philadelphia 'Daily News Sexy Single' in 2006 and cited his 'charm and magnetic personality as his most outstanding features.

In addition to his modeling talents, ladies-man Josey, who appears to punch mother of three Aida Guzman, 39, twice in the head so hard that she is knocked to the ground has also spent the last 19-years as a wannabe actor and comedian appearing in hits such as 'Tryna' Get to Heaven on 15 Cents'.

Accused: Lt Jonathan Josey is a 19-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department but also dabbles in acting

Cop by day, actor by night: Jonathan Josey - in Tryna' Get to Heaven on 15 Cents - moonlighted as an actor and comedian in his free time

As police say they will launch a full
investigation into the actions of the 19-year veteran cop, Guzman was revealed to have suffered a swollen and cut lip as well 
as injuries to her hands and arm after the violent assault from Highway 
Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II, 40.

Speaking
at her Chester home yesterday, she said she was angry at the officer's 
actions and insists she had done nothing wrong and that she was merely a
participant in the parade.

Translating for her mother, her daughter Keysha, 19, said her mom was hit from behind and while she was on the ground the officer said: 'That's what you get'. She then told him,'It wasn't me.'

She said: 'That's what happened. I didn't do it. He has no right to put his hands on me. I'm 39, I don't play games like that.

'I feel angry, very angry. I go to someplace, got a good time and look this happen, for no reason.'

Victim: Aida Guzman said he is very angry about the attack and insists she did nothing to provoke it

Lt Josey - is seen in the video punching Ms Guzman violently in the back of the head after someone else in the crowd throws silly string or water at the officers.

In March 2010, Josey was cleared in the fatal shooting of an armed robber at a 7-Eleven and was later cited for bravery.

He was stabbed in June 2010 when he was trying to break up a fight at a bar when he was off duty.

An internal affairs investigation was 
launched on Monday and Josey was placed on desk duty pending the outcome
of the investigation.

Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said of the incident: 'We'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge that the video is disturbing.

'Clearly, the one issue at hand is she does appear to be walking away. She does not appear to be facing Lt Josey at that time.'

Aftermath: Ms Guzman points to the cuts and bruises to her arms and elbow from the attack

Injuries: Ms Guzman has a cut and swollen lip as well as grazes to her hands and arm

More cuts: Ms Guzman also has scrapes to her hands and knuckles from the fall

Floored: Ms Guzman falls to the ground after the sucker punch and the police man roughly cuffs her

The 36-second video, which was first 
posted on YouTube on Sunday - the same day as the parade - has been 
watched by hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have voiced outrage at 
what is largely deemed unnecessary violence and brutality.

The
video shows a number of people milling around during a street party that followed the parade.

A number of officers appear to be surrounding a
car and as their backs are turned, someone throws an unidentified 
substance at them which some viewers speculated was either water or 
silly string.

When Lt 
Josey turns around, he zeroes in on Ms Guzman and as she nonchalantly 
walks away from the impending danger, he punches her from behind and 
knocks her to the floor.

The
39-year-old was then arrested and was issued a summary citation for 
disorderly conduct, on which police reported she had thrown beer at 
them.

Violence: The woman is floored by the cop's punch and he can be seen cuffing her roughly as she looks up bewildered

Injuries: Ms Guzman is led away from the scene bloodied from the sucker punch before being arrested

Friends
told the Daily News that these were not actions typical of Josey, calling him a stand-up citizen, loving father and caring member of 
the community.

They also revealed that bout three years ago, he and Crime Scene Unit
Officer Terry Lewis started the Life or Death Initiative, a nonprofit 
organization that teaches violence prevention to teens and ex-offenders.

The
Fraternal Order of Police said it will 'defend Josey to the end', with 
President John McNesby saying the officers did not know what was being 
thrown at them as they have been attacked by urine and bleach in the 
past.

The executive 
director of Concilio, the organization responsible for putting on the 
parade every year, called on police to fully investigate: 'While we have
no knowledge of what led to the incident, it is clear from the video 
that a police officer unnecessarily and brutally struck a woman in the 
face.

'One of the 
reasons for Concilio’s founding 50 years ago was to combat police 
brutality such as the assault shown in this video.

'Even
as we celebrate the tremendous advancements of Philadelphia’s Hispanic 
community over the decades, we cannot overlook this episode. 

'We call on the Philadelphia Police Department to fully investigate and take appropriate action.'

Around 1,500 people attended the parade on Sunday.
