These spectacular photographs show five trucks abandoned in 1943 that have rusted so severely they now blend in with their natural surroundings.

The selection of old vehicles - parked in a row next to each other - have not moved in 73 years and their corrosion is now so advanced the old motors appear camouflaged in front of the green, orange and yellow backdrop.

The vehicles were involved in the building of the Canol Road - the 'Canadian American Norman Oil Line' - in the Yukon Territory in Canada.

The five trucks, abandoned in 1943, lie camouflaged and the bottom of the brightly-colored mountain

They were used for the building of the Canadian American Norman Oil Line in the Yukon Territory, Canada

Almost every part of the abandoned trucks has now rusted into a stunning mix of bright yellow, red, green and blue

When it is the right season, the trucks blend in perfectly with their picturesque surroundings deep in the Canadian wilderness

It is 279miles long and after its competition the trucks were left on the roadside and have not moved since.

Photographer Robert Postma, 43, from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, travelled to the road to take the spectacular pictures.

He said: 'The trucks have been there since 1943 so they are 72 years old. They were involved with the building of the Canol Road which is short for the 'Canadian American Norman Oil Line.

'The owners of the trucks would have been the Canadian and American military and they were abandoned after the road was completed.

'I noticed the trucks had started to blend in with their surroundings which was the reason for my taking the photographs.

'I thought about the hardships that would have gone into the completion of this road, the landscape which it traverses is not very hospitable.

'I imagine it would have been a very daunting task done by very tough soldiers.'
