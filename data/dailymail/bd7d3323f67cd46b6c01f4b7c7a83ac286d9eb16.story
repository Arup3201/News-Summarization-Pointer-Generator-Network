Wayne Rooney might have proposed on a garage forecourt but with 75 per cent of women saying they were unhappy with the way they got engaged, it seems more effort is needed.

One woman who certainly subscribes to the make an effort school of thought is Daisy Amodio, 32, from Hertfordshire who has turned popping the question into a lucrative business.

The proposals organised by her firm, The Proposers, range from simple musical serenades to lavish designer shopping splurges followed by a helicopter ride to a country church for the big moment.

Popping the question: Daisy Amodio, 32, spends her days organising other people's perfect proposals

'It all started when we spotted a man in Hyde Park one evening who was trying to spell "make me the happiest man alive" but who had spelled happiness wrong,' explains Amodio.

'He proceeded to
 tell us that he was planning to propose in five minutes time and we were so 
excited that we offered to hide and take pictures of the happy 
moment.

'Needless to say, we captured the yes and so The Proposers was born.'

Since that moment just over two years ago, Amodio, a petite blonde in skyscraper heels, has gone on to orchestrate hundreds more proposals, some restrained and others endearingly wacky.

Popular choices include flash mobs, musical serenades and champagne picnics, while others involve splashing out on helicopters, super-cars and even, in one case, recreating the wedding scene from Love Actually.

But while Amodio says she and her team can pull off most of her clients' more outlandish ideas, some are beyond even her network of contacts.

'One of the wackiest proposal requests we’ve received was from a guy who honestly thought we could arrange for the Queen to be at his proposal,' she chuckles.

'We politely told him that unless we hired a lookalike, there was absolutely no way the Queen would come to his proposal. He didn’t call us back.'

Others have asked for all-action affairs, with the result that Amodio and her team have had to gird their loins and get to grips with everything from abseiling to skiing and even scuba diving.

It all sounds fairly intense - even more so when Amodio reveals that some of the most simple seeming proposals can turn out to be among the most challenging.

'We recently got asked to help with a proposal at Barafundle Beach in Wales,' she explains, 'which was once voted the best beach in the world.

'It was to be sunset proposal surrounded with love notes, fairy lights, candles, cushions and rugs and so on but when we arrived, the beach was nowhere to be seen.'

Venue: Venues include private beaches, churches and in this case, an art gallery

Instead, laden with candles, cushions and champagne, Amodio had to spend half an hour hiking along the clifftop before navigating a tricky descent down 100 steep steps.

Struggling to light the candles in the face of bitter sea winds, matters grew worse when, unbeknown to Amodio, who had no phone signal on the secluded beach, the client arrived early.

'Luckily enough, we spotted them in the distance and hid,' she chuckles, 'and the proposal went without a hitch.

'It then dawned on us that we would have to pack everything up at midnight and then hike back along the cliff in the dark.

'Let’s just say that it was a horrendous walk back but it was all in the name of a couple getting a gorgeous proposal.'

Happily, not all involve candles and cliff top treks. Others have included unique artwork and rose petals, while more still were traditional with a twist - among them, Amodio's own.

'I’m more of a private person and always 
said that I’d love to turn the lock on our front door to find something going on inside,' she smiles.

'Well one day I did turn that lock and was surprised by a trail of rose petals and candles leading to the roof terrace 
door.

'The door had a huge sign on it that said, "Is this how you 
pictured your future?" and I opened it to find him 
surrounded by thousands of lanterns, candles and flowers.

'He had my 
ring made for me 
and even booked a nail appointment because he knew I’d want to show my 
ring off. It was certainly how I pictured my future.'

And Amodio isn't the only woman looking for something special from a proposal. 'Times have changed,' she explains.

No luck: One client asked Daisy to invite the Queen to his proposal - unfortunately, she had to say no

'In 2014, couples want
 more of a story. It doesn’t need to cost the earth but it does need to be thoughtful and personalised.'

This is where Amodio and The Proposers come in, offering unique proposals that cost between £500 and £50,000.

'Everybody has a different opinion on proposals but I think it should whatever you want it to be,' she continues.

'If you want to declare it to the world via a dancing flash mob in Covent Garden then that’s amazing but if you’d prefer to keep it private and simple then that’s fabulous too.

'Some people want a great story to 
remember and tell everyone and some people wouldn’t care if it was in a 
car park – everyone’s different,' she adds.

'The men we deal with are 
usually extremely romantic and just want to make sure they propose in the very best way.'
