Doctors are being urged to use a new blood pressure measuring device that detects a dangerous heart condition which makes sufferers more likely to suffer a stroke

Doctors are being urged to use a new blood pressure measuring device that can also detect a dangerous heart condition.

Atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate, can lead to dizziness, shortness of breath and palpitations.

The condition also makes a person up to five times more likely to have a stroke.

But some of the 800,000 people who suffer from the condition in the UK have no symptoms and are not aware that their heart rate is irregular.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) said if doctors suspect a patient has high blood pressure, they should use the WatchBP Home A device which could ‘opportunistically’ detect atrial fibrillation.

Nice said that if medics in England used the device it would increase the discovery rate of the condition.

It said use of the device would mostly benefit those over the age of 65, many of whom would already be having their blood pressure measured.

Professor Carole Longson, director of the Nice Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ‘The evidence indicates that the device can offer advantages in detecting atrial fibrillation opportunistically while measuring blood pressure, and that using the device in primary care could increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation compared with taking the pulse by hand.

‘This would allow preventative treatment to be considered to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation-related stroke.

‘The guidance is not about screening for atrial fibrillation, but about the benefits that the device offers in helping to pick up atrial fibrillation by chance in people with suspected high blood pressure or those being screened for high blood pressure, in primary care.’

If doctors suspect that a patient has high blood pressure through routine tests, they should use the WatchBP Home A device which could ¿opportunistically¿ detect atrial fibrillation, says NICE

Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘This new device won’t replace electro-cardiograms but any device that aids in earlier detection of atrial fibrillation should be welcomed.

‘Atrial fibrillation is a potentially dangerous condition that affects roughly one in 100 people in the UK and can increase four-fold the risk of a stroke.

‘With appropriate treatment that risk can be substantially reduced so early diagnosis is vital.’

Dr Clare Walton, of the Stroke Association, said: ‘Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for stroke, increasing your risk by up to five times and resulting in around 12,500 strokes every year.

‘Unfortunately not everyone who has atrial fibrillation will know they have it, yet we know that around 4,500 strokes each year could be prevented if atrial fibrillation patients received appropriate treatment.’

Dr Walton added: ‘A blood pressure testing machine that can detect an irregular pulse will help identify more people with atrial fibrillation and in turn enable them to receive medication to reduce their risk of stroke.’
