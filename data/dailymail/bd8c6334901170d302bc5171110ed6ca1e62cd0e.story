More than 957,000 immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally have received work permits since Barack Obama became president, a shocking report revealed on Monday.

The Center for Immigration Studies uncovered documents through a Freedom of Information Act request, showing that more than 5.5 million new work permits were issued to aliens overall from 2009 to 2014.

That was more than the number of green cards – lawful permanent residence authorizations – and temporary worker admissions in those years.

The organization called it 'a huge parallel immigrant work authorization system outside the limits set by Congress that inevitably impacts opportunities for U.S. workers, damages the integrity of the immigration system, and encourages illegal immigration.'

The 5.5 milliion number also includes 1.8 million work permits given to to immigrants with temporary visas or visa waivers. And two-thirds of those held visas that did not permit employment in the United States.

More than 470,000 aliens on tourist visas have received the work permits since 2009; another 532,000 went to foreign students. The Obama administration gave more than 156,000 to dependents of guest workers and students, although deferal law prohibits it. 

'Inexplicably,' wrote Center for Immigration Studies director of policy studies Jessica Vaughan. is  1,200 new work permits were issued to aliens who were denied asylum, were suspected of using fraudulent documents, were stowaways, or were refused at a port of entry.'

Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions called Monday for 'a full investigation.'

'This massive increase in the labor supply has occurred simultaneously with a steep drop in family incomes and a sharp rise in the number of Americans pushed out of the workforce,' he said. 

'All jobs gains since the recession have gone to foreign workers, while the slack labor market has depressed median family incomes almost $5,000 in that time.'

Sessions backs a GOP effort to hold up Department of Homeland Security funding past February 27 unless Obama drops his plan to mainstream 5 mllion or more illegal immigrants by guaranteeing them they win't be deported through at least January 2017.

The president's plan also calls for green cards and work permits for most of them – but Monday's report suggests many already have the documents. 

A Gallup poll published on January 29 found that only 7 per cent of Americans want U.S. immigration policy changed in a way that would admit more immigrants.

Sessions said a House of Representatives bill pending on the Senate floor 'fully funds every lawful activity of DHS; what it does not fund is outlaw behavior.' 

Work permits can be used as one of multiple documents needed to obtain driver's licenses and federal benefits.

Vaughan said the documents her organization obtained 'indicate that the executive branch is operating a huge parallel immigrant work authorization system outside the bounds of the laws and limits written by Congress.'

'It inevitably reduces job opportunities for Americans.'
