This is the dramatic moment a college student's car burst into flames moments after she escaped.

The incident took place just yards from a petrol station in North Cheam, Surrey, yesterday morning, after the woman smelled burning plastic.

When smoke began to fill the front of the car, the student ran out on to the side of the A217 where she watched the vehicle burst into flames.

No one was hurt in the accident near St Dunstan's Hill, though the girl lost several college assignments that were in her back seat.

Fire fighter Ray Foster said: 'The lady was driving and she had the heater on in her car. After a while it started to smell of burning plastic and then smoke started coming through the passenger compartment.

'She got out of the car and it was engulfed in flames.'

Mr Foster added the blaze was so severe, the car's engine dropped out.

'She was a college student and all her assignments were in the car plus Â£200 worth of make-up'.

'But luckily no-one was going past.

'The lady driving got out in time - I would say four seconds before the explosion

New Malden fire fighters said the student was understandably 'shaken up' by the incident which could have taken her life
