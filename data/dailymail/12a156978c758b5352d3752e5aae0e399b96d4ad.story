Their tight-knit team spirit has helped them soar to the summit of the Commonwealth Games medal leader board.

But it appears some members of Team England may be enjoying Glasgow’s party atmosphere too much.

Olympic long-jump gold medallist Greg Rutherford, 27, criticised ‘ignorant athletes’ who have been disturbing his preparations with their noisy antics.

Disturbed: Greg Rutherford is hoping he can repeat his London Olympic Games success

Unlike its strictly alcohol-free London equivalent, Glasgow’s games village is designed to allow athletes to let their hair down and enjoy themselves.

The £230million hub, in the city’s east end, features a bar, jukebox, beauty salon and thousands of free condoms.

There are also a number of chilled cabinets filled with bottles of free champagne.

London 2012 star Rutherford yesterday expressed his frustration through a series of Tweets which appeared to point the finger at his England teammates.

He wrote: ‘Being in an athletes village is great until the ignorant athletes make more noise than a herd of elephants startled in a china shop.

‘It bloody kills me. I have the noisiest people above me with some serious big feet banging around. 

'I think some people are determined to annoy every other athlete around them. Strong words will soon be said.’

His friend and England teammate Bianca Williams expressed sympathy, writing: ‘Me too Greg! It’s so inconsiderate. The door slamming is so ridiculous.’

One of the co-ordinators of London’s Olympic village advised the long jumper to make a formal complaint.

Lucy Katan, of the Sport and Recreation Alliance – who managed the arrival and departure of 24,000 athletes and support staff at the 2012 Games – tweeted: ‘Report them to village management.

Is the party atmosphere in the athletes’ village the reason why Olympic cycling golden girl Laura Trott failed to pick up a medal in yesterday’s women’s 10km scratch event? 

The 22-year-old had been favourite but could manage only 11th place. 

Fellow Olympic team pursuit champions Dani King and Joanna Rowsell finished fourth and 19th respectively.

‘All athletes should respect each other’s preparations right until the last day of the Games.’

The Commonwealth Games Federation insisted athlete rowdiness was not its responsibility and that it was up to English officials to police their competitors.

Chief executive Mike Hooper said: ‘Team England manage their team and this is a matter for them. Because of the size of their team they have a specified part of the village that they can control. 

'It’s a great environment within the village and we have received absolutely no complaints whatsoever. The tweet that he [Greg Rutherford] made is news to me.’

A Team England spokeswoman stressed it was happy with the Games village and its facilities.

She said: ‘We will be reminding athletes to be considerate to each other when sharing a house.’

However, a team insider hinted that the bulk of the disturbance may be coming from athletes who are representing other nations. 

He added: ‘We are next to South Africa, Mauritius and Wales. Everyone is bordering everyone.’

The world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt, sprinkled his stardust on the Games when he arrived in Glasgow yesterday.

However, the Jamaican said he would compete in only this week’s sprint relay and not take part in his favoured 100m race as he is recovering from injury.
