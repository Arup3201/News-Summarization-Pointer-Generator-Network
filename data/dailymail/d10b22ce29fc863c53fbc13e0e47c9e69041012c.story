The New York Times editorial board on Saturday endorsed a repeal of the federal ban on marijuana, becoming the largest paper in the nation to back the idea as it compared the U.S. government's stance on America's most widely used illicit drug to the prohibition on alcohol from 1920 to 1933.

The post on the newspaper's website is part of an editorial series that in the coming days will explore different aspects of marijuana use, from health effects to how the criminal justice system treats it.

'It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition, 13 years in which people kept drinking, otherwise law-abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished,' the editorial states.

Forward thinking? The New York Times suggested in an editorial published Saturday that the United States make pot legal

'It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana, inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol.'

The editorial under the headline 'Repeal Prohibition, Again' comes less than two years after voters in Washington state and Colorado became the first in the nation to sanction taxing and regulating pot at the state level for recreational users 21 years and older. Marijuana stores have since opened in both states.

A number of other states, including Oregon and Alaska, will vote this year on whether to take the same step, and polls from the Pew Research Center and Gallup have shown a majority of Americans support legalizing weed.

The New York Times editorial cites the 658,000 arrests nationwide for marijuana possession in 2012, and the fact such arrests disproportionately ensnare young African American men.

It also finds moderate pot use poses no risk to otherwise healthy adults, but that concerns about the drug's effects on the adolescent brain should merit banning its use by those under the age of 21.

The New York Times, which on its editorial Web page showed a U.S. flag with its stars morphing into marijuana leaves, is the largest newspaper in the nation to take an editorial position calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana.

'I think it’s playing right into the hands of this big (marijuana) industry that seeks only to increase addiction while reaping profits,” said Kevin Sabet, co-founder of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalization.

A number of smaller newspapers, including the Newark, New Jersey-based Star-Ledger, have called for some form of legalizing or decriminalizing pot, which over 20 U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow for medical use.

ALASKA (legalization)Alaska may seem like an unlikely place to follow the lead of liberals in Colorado and Washington, but the state's libertarian electorate may provide a good look at how a different breed of voters will respond to marijuana legalization. It's early, but proponents have a big head start on fundraising and organization, led by the Marijuana Policy Project based in Washington, D.C. Marijuana legalization failed in Alaska in 2000 and 2004, but advocates say the landscape has changed markedly since then.If the measure is approved, adults could use marijuana legally and purchase it at state-licensed stores, but use in public would still be illegal.

OREGON (legalization)Oregonians rejected legalization just two years ago but are all but certain to have a chance to reconsider this November. State elections officials haven't yet validated the signatures turned in last week, but advocates submitted far more than they needed. Oregon has long been on the leading edge of the decades-long push to loosen marijuana laws. It was the first state to decriminalize small-scale marijuana possession in 1973 — a step that's been taken in more than a dozen other states. Marijuana use remains illegal, but possession of a small amount of the drug is punished with a citation and fine rather than a criminal charge.  Oregon was also among the first states to approve medical marijuana. Unlike Oregon's 2012 effort, the team behind the current initiative has strong backing from many of the groups and individuals who helped bankroll the successful campaigns in Colorado and Washington.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (legalization)The D.C. Cannabis Campaign says the group submitted 55,000 signatures for a legalization initiative on Monday — twice the number required to put the issue before voters. The measure would allow possession of up to two ounces of marijuana in the nation's capital. But the effort could be frustrated by Congress, which reviews all new laws in the District and has moved to block its other recent efforts to ease up on marijuana laws. Last month, the Republican-controlled House took a big step toward blocking a decriminalization bill passed by city lawmakers. That measure would make marijuana possession a civil offense subject to a $25 fine, one of the lowest in the nation. Congress used a similar amendment to block the District from implementing its medical marijuana program for 10 years.

FLORIDA (medical)The push for more liberal marijuana laws is not limited to full legalization of the drug. Florida voters will be deciding whether to allow the drug for medicinal use. A poll by Quinnipiac University in May found overwhelming support for medical marijuana in Florida, where it will require support from 60 percent of voters to pass in November. Nearly 9 out of 10 voters said they support allowing adults to use the drug for medical purposes. Support was over 80 percent for all age groups. State lawmakers voted this year to legalize a strain of low-potency marijuana to treat epilepsy and cancer patients.

NEW YORK (medical)New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill earlier this month making his state the 23rd to allow medical marijuana, though his state will have one of the most restrictive programs in the country. The drug isn't expected to be available for at least 19 months while the state works out regulations.Patients with one of 10 diseases will be allowed to use the drug, but it must be ingested or vaporized; smoking it will remain illegal. Some advocates argued it is too restrictive but called it an important step.
