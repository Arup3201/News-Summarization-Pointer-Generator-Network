To the uninitiated, it looks as though the parishioners of St John’s Church are being rather rude.

But their tablet computers aren’t for sneakily checking their emails. Instead, they’re a very modern way for them to read hymns and prayers.

Yesterday the congregation took part in what is believed to be Britain’s first ever digital church service.

Members of the congregation were handed tablet computers before the service, which they can use to enlarger the text of the service as they follow it

The UK's first digital church service allowed the congregation to follow the sermon, bible passages, prayers and hymns live on tablet computers

The trial service that was delivered to tablet computers via service provider, The Cloud using WiFi from a local cafe

The digital service was designed to help some of the members of the congregation of St John's who had been struggling to read the small text in the printed hymn and prayer books

The idea came about after some 
parishioners said they were struggling to follow the tiny print in the 
church’s pocket-sized hymn books because of their deteriorating 
eyesight.

The tablets, with their bright 
displays and ability to enlarge the text, make it much easier for some 
of the older members of the congregation to follow the service.

They access the hymns and prayers through a wi-fi network installed in the church cafe next door.

Alun Rowlands, curate of the church in
Mickleover, Derbyshire, said: ‘The church leadership team is really 
keen to make our services as accessible as possible. At the same time we
are keen to use audio-visual technologies as much as possible by 
projecting our liturgy and songs on to large screens.

‘The two aims seemed to be in tension 
until we had wi-fi installed and began experimenting to replicate the 
exact content on to individual tablets for those with visual impairment 
of differing kinds.

‘We are delighted with the progress so
far and look forward to see how we can develop things further.’ 
Parishioners said they were delighted with the mini computers. Paul 
Gribbin, 62, who attended the service yesterday, said: ‘We have one man 
who is registered blind and for him being able to blow up the text and 
then scan across using his finger was great.

Church curate Rev Alun Rowlands said they are keen to use audio visual technologies as much as possible

‘He didn’t need to fiddle with a book and any sort of magnification because what he needed was there already.’

He added: ‘We have been experimenting 
with audio-visual technology for a while but to actually have it there 
in the palm of your hand is marvellous. It felt like you were holding a 
hymn book or prayer book, but you didn’t have to rummage around to find 
the right page.

‘It created a really nice atmosphere for the whole service and was really good fun.’

The church is working with networking company The Cloud, which agreed to donate the tablets to members of the community.
