Violence erupted on Wall Street this morning with hundreds of protesters clashing with police as they marched in Manhattan - jumping over barriers, pushing over police scooters and blocking traffic.

Fifteen protesters have already been arrested in New York today after they got into fights with police officers after a planned ‘eviction’ was postponed following a last-minute standoff with authorities.

Park owners - backed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg - put off the scheduled clean-up and Occupy Wall Street demonstrators celebrated this morning as they marched down Broadway.

Stocks scored their first back-to-back weekly gains since early July on Friday, on strong Google earnings and optimism towards a solution to the euro zone's debt crisis.

The gains put the Dow and the Nasdaq back into positive territory for the year, marking a dramatic reversal from two weeks ago, when the threat of a Greek default and sour U.S. data had buyers running from the market.

The Dow Jones was up 166 points, or 1.5 percent, at 11,644. The S&P 500 was up 21 points, or 1.7 per cent, at 1,225. The Nasdaq was up 48 points, or 1.8 per cent, at 2,668.

The dramatic move came just hours after 
demonstrators chanting 'Hell no! We won't go!' stormed a Wall Street 
restaurant last night to confront Mayor Bloomberg over a planned 
clean-up of their camp.

Protesters surrounded Cipriani 
restaurant in Manhattan as the Mayor was at dinner in an attempt to hand
 him a petition with 310,000 signatures supporting their right to remain
 in Zuccotti Park.

Their 
anger was triggered by the Mayor's endorsement of a clean-up of the 
'unsanitary' Occupy Wall Street encampment - which was postponed by Brookfield Office Properties at the last minute.

Mayor Bloomberg said it was Brookfield rather than him that decided to postpone the clean-up, but added that the firm had come under pressure from city politicians, reported the New York Daily News.

'My understanding is that Brookfield 
got lots of calls from many elected officials, threatening them and 
saying: "If you don't stop this, we'll make your life more difficult",' 
Mayor Bloomberg said.

'If 
those elected officials would spend half as much time trying to promote 
(the) city and get jobs to come here, we'd go a long way to answering 
the concerns of the protests.'

New
 York City Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway made the announcement and 
protesters, who viewed the clean-up as an 'eviction notice', streamed 
into the plaza this morning.

'Late
 last night we received notice from Brookfield Properties that they're 
postponing their scheduled cleaning of Zuccotti Park,' a tweet by Mayor 
Bloomberg's office said this morning.

The
 demand that protesters clear out had set up a potential turning point 
in a movement that began on September 17 with a small group of activists
 and has swelled to include several thousand people.

Occupy Wall Street has inspired similar demonstrations across the U.S. and become an issue in the Republican presidential race.

The
 protesters' demands are wide-ranging, but they are united in blaming 
Wall Street and corporate interests for the economic pain they say all 
but the wealthiest Americans have endured since the financial meltdown.

Protesters
 have had some run-ins with police, but mass arrests on the Brooklyn 
Bridge and an incident in which protesters were pepper-sprayed seemed to
 energise their movement.

The
 protest has led sympathetic groups in other cities to stage their own 
local rallies and demonstrations such as Occupy Boston,  Occupy Los 
Angeles and Occupy Seattle.

There
 was a strong police presence and a showdown with protesters had been 
feared. Hours earlier, the Mayor had refused to leave his New York 
restaurant, instead making his exit out of a back door.

‘I'll believe it when we're able to 
stay here,’ protester Peter Hogness said. ‘One thing we have learned 
from this is that we need to rely on ourselves and not on promises from 
elected officials.’

But Nick
 Gulotta was jubilant. He had been holding up a sign saying: ‘Bloomberg 
Don't Evict Occupy Wall Street.’ People cheered as he scratched out the 
‘don't’ and replaced it with ‘didn't.’

‘It shows when people work together, you really can make a difference and make justice happen,’ Mr Gulotta said.

Boisterous
 cheers floated up as the announcement of the postponement circulated, 
and protesters began polling each other on whether to make an immediate 
march to Wall Street nearby.

‘Late last night, we received notice 
from the owners of Zuccotti Park - Brookfield Properties - that they are
 postponing their scheduled cleaning of the park,’ Deputy Mayor Holloway
 said.

Ten people in an Occupy Seattle protest were arrested last night at a park, police said.

The demonstrators were detained after Westlake Park closed late on Thursday night.

Detective Mark Jamieson said the arrests came as police focused on protesters associated with a tent who did not comply with orders to leave.

Earlier, some protesters gathered outside a downtown hotel where Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney had a private fundraiser.

‘For the time being (they are) 
withdrawing their request from earlier in the week for police assistance
 during their cleaning operation.’

New York police said they would make arrests if Brookfield requested it and laws were broken.

Deputy Mayor Holloway said Brookfield
 believes it can work out an arrangement with the protesters that ‘will 
ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use,’ it said.

Brookfield
 had planned to power-wash the plaza section by section over 12 hours 
and allow the protesters back - but without much of the equipment they 
needed to sleep and camp there.

The
 company's rules, which haven't been enforced, have been no tarps, no 
sleeping bags and no storing personal property on the ground.

The park is privately owned but is 
required to be open to the public 24 hours per day. In a last-ditch bid 
to stay, protesters had mopped and picked up garbage.

Many protesters said the only way they 
would leave is by force. Nicole Carty, a 23-year-old from Atlanta, had 
hoped the group's cleaning effort would stave off any confrontation.

‘We tell them: “Hey the park is clean, 
there's no need for you to be here”,’ she said. ‘If they insist on 
coming in, we will continue to occupy the space.’

'I'll believe it when we're able to stay here. One thing we have learned from this is that we need to rely on ourselves and not on promises from elected officials'

Protester Peter Hogness

A spokesman for Bloomberg, whose girlfriend is a member of Brookfield's board of directors, had said on Thursday that Brookfield had requested the city's assistance in maintaining the park.

‘We will continue to defend and guarantee their free speech rights, but those rights do not include the ability to infringe on the rights of others,’ his spokesman Marc La Vorgna said.

Several protests are planned this 
weekend across the U.S. and Canada, and European activists are also 
organising their own demonstrations.
