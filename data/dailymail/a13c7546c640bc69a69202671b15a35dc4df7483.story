Searchers have discovered a body in a Texas creek that is thought to be a 26-year-old mother of four who disappeared the day after Christmas.

Melissa Sowders' family fears she was killed after she went meet up with her estranged husband Matt Sowders to visit her 18-month-old daughter on December 26. 

Authorities found a body in Cypress Creek in Harris County, Texas, Thursday afternoon that they believe is Mrs Sowders - though an autopsy will be needed to confirm it is her.

Mr Sowders denies he was involved in his wife's disappearance. He has hired a lawyer and police say he is not cooperating with the investigation.

Fears: Melissa Sowders, 26, has been missing since last Thursday. The pregnant mother-of-four was going to meet her estranged husband when she vanished and her abandoned car was found the next day

The video is from a Christmas Day visit Sowders made to her boyfriend's godparents' home. She disappeared the next day

'As far as we know he has threatened her numerous times. He has had a knife to her throat before,' Melissa's cousin Michelle Bierman told ABC News.

'We think he just went off the edge when he found out she was two months pregnant with Jason's child.'

The godparents of Miss Sowders's boyfriend released surveillance video of her Christmas Day visit to their small business - just hours before she went missing. She can be seen on camera gently rubbing her pregnant belly.

Miss Sowders vanished after meeting 
her estranged husband to visit her youngest child, according to her new 
boyfriend, Jason Sanford. Mr Sanford, says she was terrified of her ex -
 with whom she has four children.

Police have interviewed Miss Sowder's husband, but have not named him as a suspect.

Crickitt Kreger, Mr Sanford's godmother, told KHOU-TV she was one of the last people to see Miss Sowder alive. She and Mr Sanford visited Mrs Kreger and her husband for Christmas.

'I did tell her Christmas Day, you're working your way into my heart,' Ms Kreger told the TV station.

Miss Sowder's family say they fear she is already dead, that she drowned in Cypress Creek.

'The water is cold, she's in there. It's not a proper place,' Michelle Bierman, Miss Sowder's cousin, told KHOU.

Deputies suspect foul play.

Sowders' boyfriend, Jason Sanford, told police he last saw her when she took him to work at 6.15am on Thursday in her white Honda Accord.

He told deputies that she was supposed to meet her ex-husband and their youngest daughter at a McDonald's - and her family said they fear he could be involved in her disappearance.

'She was terrified of him. Terrified,' Michelle Bierman, Sowders' cousin, told KHOU11 on Monday.

Relatives told the news channel that her estranged husband was abusive towards her and did not like her having a new boyfriend or having a child by him.

Search: Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff Department had searched a wooded area along Cypress Creek on Saturday. They were then searching the water for any signs of the woman's body

Hunt: Volunteers used sonar equipment to search for the missing mother in the creek

Where's Melissa? They show the reading that has sparked their interest - before her body was found

'Pretty much from the first day that we knew she was missing, and the circumstances of how she went missing. We knew. We knew,' Bierman added.

Concerns: Her family says she was terrified of her ex - but police have not named him a suspect

Court records show that the ex-husband, who has custody of their children, actually filed for divorce in October.

Authorities have interviewed the man but have not named him as a suspect.

Volunteers from Texas Equusearch are using boats with sonar equipment at Cypress Creek and said they have already found readings of interest in 12 feet of water.

'We don’t want to leave this water until we know that we’ve absolutely cleared everything,' Tom Miller from Texas Equusearch said.

'I mean, there’s a lot of debris in there. There’s a lot of loose rocks in there. There's a lot of stuff and there's times we get false images but I really want to take a lot closer look at it.'

But he said he was hopeful that Sowders was going to be found.

'I’m very optimistic she’s going to be found,' he said. 'I would hope it's gonna be today. If it’s not…I’m optimistic she’s gonna be found.'

Hopeful: Volunteers with Texas Equusearch, seen Saturday, said they were hopeful she would be found alive

But her family is less positive about her returning to them alive.

'At this point, it’s been too long,' Bierman said. 'It's been too long. The reality is she's not gonna come back alive.'
