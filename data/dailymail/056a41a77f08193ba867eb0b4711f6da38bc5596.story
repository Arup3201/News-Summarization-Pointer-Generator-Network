Read our brilliant preview to the new NBA season... so, who will come out on top? 

Tony Parker scored 23 points, including a big three-pointer late in the game as the San Antonio Spurs opened their title defence with a thrilling 101-100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.

Manu Ginobili added 20 points for San Antonio, which shot 53 percent from the field. 

Tim Duncan scored 14 points and 13 rebounds for his 14th double-double in a season opener, the most by any player in NBA history, according to Elias Sports.

Monta Ellis scored 26 points for Dallas and Dirk Nowitzki had 18. Devin Harris finished with 17 points.

Following a video recap of the 2014 season narrated by actor and Spurs fan Samuel L. Jackson, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver presented San Antonio's staff and players with their championship rings. 

The inscription inside the ring was 'Good to Great' - which was coach Gregg Popovich's mantra last season.

After Nowitzki gave Dallas a 100-98 lead with a fadeaway jumper over Boris Diaw with 1:37 remaining, Parker drained a three in front of the Mavericks' bench off a feed from Diaw. Parker was four from four from long range, matching a career high for threes in a game.

Meanwhile, Houston's James Harden scored 32 points and Dwight Howard added 13 points and 11 rebounds before getting into a shouting match with Kobe Bryant as the Rockets spoiled Bryant's return to the Lakers with a 108-90 victory.

Bryant's comeback game got even worse when Lakers rookie forward Julius Randle seriously injured his right leg in the fourth quarter, leaving his NBA debut on a wheeled stretcher.

The seventh overall pick out of Kentucky collided with two Rockets under the basket and landed awkwardly.

At New Orleans, Anthony Davis had 26 points, 17 rebounds and nine blocks to lead the New Orleans Saints to a 101-84 season-opening win over the Orlando Magic.
