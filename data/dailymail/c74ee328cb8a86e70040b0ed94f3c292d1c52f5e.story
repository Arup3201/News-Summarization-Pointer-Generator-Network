By signing for Roma, Ashley Cole will become only the second British player to play for the Serie A club.

Welsh legend John Charles played for Roma between 1962 and 1963, scoring four goals in just 10 appearances before ending his career with Cardiff City. 

Cole's agent, Jonathan Barnett, also confirmed recently: 'At the moment it is only clubs based abroad - there may be other developments, but for the moment, that is all we are talking.

'The situation is that we are talking to several clubs.'

The former England defender is a free agent after leaving Chelsea and has had interest
 from Monaco and various Major League Soccer franchises.

But Cole, who spent eight years at Stamford Bridge after moving there from Arsenal, is set to move to Serie A.
