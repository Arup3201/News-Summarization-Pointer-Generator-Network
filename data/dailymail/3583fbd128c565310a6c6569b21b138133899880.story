A gay couple are considering legal action against a bus company after they were forced to move to the back of a bus by the driver because they were holding hands. 

Ron McCoy and his partner Christopher Bowers boarded the shuttle bus from Albuquerque's Sunport Airport after flying in from their home in Portland, Oregon, the day before the Albuquerque Pride Festival began on June 28.

The couple was in town for a long-awaited road-trip, but their elation soon turned to dismay when the driver of the bus noticed they were holding hands and told them to sit at the back.

Excited: Ron McCoy (left) and his partner Christopher Bowers had just arrived in Albuquerque when a shuttle bus driver discriminated against them

Shocked: Ron McCoy (right) and his partner Christopher (left) were appalled at their treatment on the Sunport shuttle bus

'I saw him look at us, look down at his hands and he looked so angry,' McCoy told KRQE.

'He just blurted out at me, he goes, “Okay, if you're going to do that, you're going to the back of the bus.'"

Discomfited, the couple did as he ordered and moved down the bus. When they arrived at their destination, they had recovered enough to question the driver on his actions.

'I said, "I think it was because you didn't like the fact that I was holding my partner's hand." He goes, "See, now you're telling on yourself." I was like, "What?" and my partner responds, "Well, that's discrimination," and the driver responds, "You're telling on yourself again,"' McCoy said.

Closure: McCoy says he and Bowers are still upset about the incident and have received no formal apology from Standard Parking

A fellow passenger witnessed the incident and gave the driver a piece of her mind.

'I told the bus driver that I was completely appalled that anybody would be treated this way,' Bernadette Aguirre told KRQE.

Witness: Bernadette Aguirre saw the incident and told the bus driver his behavior was 'appalling'

'And the driver looks back at us and goes, "I'll show you what's appalling," and he points to us,' McCoy said.

The incident occurred just two days 
after historic rulings overturning the Defense of Marriage Act and 
rejecting Proposition 8 in California.

McCoy
and his partner remain upset about the incident that happened more than
a month ago. As yet, they haven't received a formal apology from the bus 
company.

'I’ve had people 
call me faggot. I’ve had people tell me that they hope I catch AIDS and 
die, but the difference was those were individuals being jerks and 
expressing their own bigoted, biased hate.

'But this was a guy operating a
shuttle on behalf of the city of Albuquerque,' McCoy told Alibi.

The Sunport Airport contracts its shuttle buses out to Standard Parking.

'First
and foremost, it is absolutely unacceptable,' Dan Jiron, Sunport 
spokesperson, told KRQE.

'We immediately got in touch with Standard Parking to 
assess what exactly happened. They acknowledged this was a mistake on 
the part of the driver.'

Fighting: Ron McCoy and his partner have referred the incident to the American Civil Liberties Union

'I took it personally, and I'm still upset,' McCoy said. 'I don't have any closure. Neither of us do.'

Standard Parking manager Bill Alberti told KRQE that the driver's conduct was 
inappropriate, but that he just 'overstepped a little bit'. The driver is still working for Standard Parking.

Alberti said following the incident, all drivers will undertake sensitivity and non-harassment training.

According
to Alibi, the driver told them he told the couple to move because he 
didn't want 'women and children' to see the couple's 'inappropriate 
behavior.' He refused to comment further on what he felt was 
inappropriate.

McCoy says he and his partner have filed a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union.
