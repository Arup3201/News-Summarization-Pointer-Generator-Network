Neil Patrick Harris may have been the host, but Sunday night's Academy Awards ceremony hadn't even started before John Travolta stole the show. 

The actor, who famously fluffed Frozen singer Idina Menzel’s name at last year’s Oscars, grabbed all the social media heat again by sneaking up on actress Scarlett Johansson on the red carpet.

Travolta, 61, approached Scarlett from behind and kissed her on the cheek, while sliding his hand around her waist.

The surprising smooch, and Johansson's amused reaction, was captured with one click of the camera. And the rest, as they say, was history.

I ain't sayin' he's a gold digger: A flurry of memes have since erupted after Travolta's kiss, including this one with rapper Kanye West 

A flurry of memes have since erupted after Travolta's kiss. 

They feature Kanye West, the Statue of Liberty and even Travolta kissing himself, dressed up as his character Edna Turnblad from the movie-musical Hairspray. 

A number of world leaders, including Kim Jong-Un and Vladimir Putin, also get a chance to receive the Pulp Fiction star's smooch. 

But the famously affectionate Joe Biden makes sure to cut in on the Scarlett action himself. Who said three's a crowd? 

Travolta garnered even more attention Sunday night after he was reunited with Menzel, who he mistakenly introduced last year as 'Adele Dazeem', and proceeded to continually stroke her face.

The actor must have heard about it, because he later said: 'Apparently I played with her chin too much'.
