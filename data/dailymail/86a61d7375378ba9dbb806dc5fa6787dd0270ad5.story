In the case of the oddly familiar Lego figure, the officers of Hampshire police had only one suspect – and he was right under their noses.

Step forward PC Rob Thomas, who was startled to discover that Lego’s new model policeman was the very image of himself, right down to his collar number of 1337.

The 48-year-old father of two said: ‘One of my colleagues collects the Lego figures and found my doppelganger as he opened the latest bag.

‘When I clocked in for my next shift, there was the little Lego fellow waiting for me in my work tray. I think the likeness is amazing, especially with the matching moustache.

'There's been a lot of banter about my resemblance to this old British bobby. My colleagues have been sending me lots of emails with photos of him attached.

'One
of the lines I've had is "if it was a lifesize figure they'd need more 
moulding of the plastic", poking fun at my larger physique.

'My
family think the whole thing is hilarious and my wife Sandra thinks 
it's highly entertaining having her husband immortalised in plastic 
too.'

PC Thomas, who has a 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son, said he was a fan of Lego as a child.

He
was so intrigued by the resemblance that he even asked Lego about the 
model. But the firm told him that the figure’s features and number had 
been designed purely by chance.

The limited edition 'Constable' mini figure, complete with hat and truncheon, has just been released as part of Series 11, a collection of 13 toys.

Doppelganger: The Lego figure is perfect in every detail and even has PC Thomas' number

Its biography on minifigures.lego.com reads: 'The Constable is an old-fashioned sort of policeman. He doesn't use a fancy squad car or motorcycle.

'Instead, he patrols the cobbled streets on foot, twirling his baton as he walks his daily route. He knows every law by heart, he always keeps his uniform neat, and he only takes off his helmet in the presence of the Queen.'

PC Thomas, known to colleagues as 'Norm', worked as a response driver before moving to a Safer Neighbourhoods team four years ago.

He was given the number - a Southampton number that belonged to a previous officer who had retired - when he joined the force.

The shoulder system has now changed, so no one will take over this number when PC Thomas retires.
