Said Kouachi - one of the brothers who gunned down 12 people in Paris on January 7 - has been buried at a secret location in his home city of Reims.

The city's officials said the burial was carried out at the French government's demand, despite concerns it could become a shrine for extremists.

The Kouachi brothers - Said and Cherif - killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, sparking a wave of terror attacks across Paris which left 17 innocent people dead.  

A spokesman for the city of Reims said: 'Given the risk of disturbance of the peace and in order to quickly turn the page of this tragic episode, it was decided to do the burial quickly.'

Triumphant: He and his brother, Cherif (pictured), were pictured chanting 'we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' moments after the attack

Massacre: The attack on the magazine's offices (pictured) sparked a wave of terror attacks in the city, in which 17 innocent people died

Objection: Reims' mayor initially refused to have Kouachi, who attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices (pictured), buried in his city - but the French government forced it to go ahead 

Its Mayor, Arnaud Robinet, said he'd 'categorically refuse' a request by Kouachi's family to bury him in the city where he lived - until police gunned him and his brother down on January 9.

He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate.

'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.'

Speaking Saturday on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence.

Robinet claimed he didn't know where Said Kouachi was buried in the cemetery - which he didn't identify.

Antoine Flasaquier, the lawyer of Kouachi's widow, said the burial took place overnight 'in the greatest discretion and dignity'. 

Mr Flasaquier said the widow did not attend the burial for fear she would be followed by reporters and give away the location of the grave.

Gunned down: A funeral for Ahmed Merabet, the policeman killed by the Kouachi brothers on a street in Paris, was carried out at the Bobigny Mosque in Paris on January 13

Terrorists: Said's brother, Cherif (left), will be buried in his home city of Gennevilliers outside Paris next week. There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly (right), who killed four hostages in a Kosher deli on January 9

Two other terrorists killed in shootouts with police following last week's attacks await burial. Said's brother, Cherif Kouachi, will be buried in his hometown of Gennevilliers, outside Paris. 

City officials there say they wanted to avoid 'all useless and indecent polemic' over the burial. He too will be buried in an anonymous grave 'to avoid all risk of disturbance to the peace and to preserve the town's tranquility'.

There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in Paris - before he was killed by police on January 9.
