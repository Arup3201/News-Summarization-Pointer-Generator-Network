Three daughters of disgraced Lord Antony Lambton said yesterday they are ‘sad and bitterly heartbroken’ that a family war against their brother has ended up in the courts.

Their comments came on the first day of a High Court hearing at which they are battling for a share of their late father’s estate.

The sisters, including author and former TV presenter Lady Lucinda Lambton, say they are entitled to a proportion of the £12million estate plus further assets – a claim their brother Edward Lambton, the seventh Earl of Durham, contests.

Forty years ago Lord Lambton was at the 
centre of one of the raciest scandals of his day when he was 
photographed cavorting in bed with two prostitutes.

Lord Lambton was forced to resign in 1973, when he was photographed in bed with two dominatrix prostitutes

The then junior defence minister was forced to resign and later fled to Italy where he spent the remaining 30 years of his life living in a mansion in Tuscany with his mistress, Claire Ward.

When he died aged 84 in 2006 he left his fortune to his only son Edward under the British tradition of primogeniture by which the male heir inherits not only the title but also the entire estate.

In the years after his death, three of his five daughters demanded a slice of the family fortune because all children have a right to an equal share under Italian law.

They had been in negotiations with their brother and his lawyers and were hoping to receive about £1million each in return for giving up a much larger claim.

But Lord Durham, 52, served a High Court writ in May this year in England to prevent them making claims on his inheritance in Italy.

The move upset Lucinda, 70, and her sisters Lady Beatrix Nevill, 64, and Lady Anne Lambton, 59, an actress.

It was argued at the court in London yesterday that under Italian law, all six of Lord Lambton’s children are entitled to one-ninth each of their father’s ‘heritable property’.

The daughters claim the Italian courts should decide what they receive given that Lord Lambton spent his last years in the country.

Their counsel Alexander Layton QC told the court the proceedings in England should be stayed and the case should go ahead in Italy.

He said the sisters ‘are sad and bitterly heartbroken that this family dispute should have entered into the courts at all’.

He said their action in seeking a stay was ‘designed to stop this litigation in order to reach a resolution as soon as possible’.

The court heard that the estate of £12.1million was comprised of only certain movable assets, some paintings found in England and a small amount of cash.

But Mr Layton said that during his lifetime Lord Lambton owned valuable assets, including fine collections of paintings, furniture, books and wine, and money in trusts, so the estate could be worth much more.

That could put the sisters’ claim under Italian law ‘in the region of millions of pounds’.

Lord Durham claims the English court should deal with the matter. His counsel Dominic Dowley QC said Lord Lambton had remained a British citizen. The hearing continues.
