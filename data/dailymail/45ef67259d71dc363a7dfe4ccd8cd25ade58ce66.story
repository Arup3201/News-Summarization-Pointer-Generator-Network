Ronald Koeman welcomes three former Southampton players back to St Mary's after warning his current squad to think twice before leaving the south coast.

England midfielder Adam Lallana will face the team he spent 12 years with for the first time since his £25million summer move to Liverpool.

But while Lallana has become a key part of Brendan Rodgers' Champions League push, fellow ex-Saints Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert have endured frustrating starts to their Anfield careers.

Rickie Lambert has had to make do with a spot on the bench and came close to joining Aston Villa last month

Rodgers is preferring to use midfielder Emre Chan as a makeshift centre back despite paying Southampton £20m for Croatian international Lovren.

Saints legend Lambert is likely to have to watch Sunday's game from the substitutes' bench after finding starts hard to come by since joining his boyhood heroes.

Koeman has also cited Calum Chambers' struggles at Arsenal as a reason for sought-after trio Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez to consider rejecting the advances of Premier League big-guns.

Former Barcelona star Koeman said: 'It is not always for football reasons players' move, maybe it is about money. We cannot pay salaries like the big teams play.

'If you stay you stay for different reasons, because you are sure you will play regularly in the first-team. It is about the age of the players and the experience of the player. It is normal you will lose players if you do not play every season in the Champions League.

'I said to Calum Chambers: "I don't think this is a good moment to go to Arsenal because you need to develop yourself and you will play much more here than you will at Arsenal."'

While Lambert is assured of a heroes' reception from the Southampton supporters, Lallana can expect a much more frosty welcome.

Many supporters are angry with the way Lallana forced through his switch to Anfield, with suggestions from club insiders he refused to play for Southampton again.

Lallana has refuted those claims and former teammate Schneiderlin is baffled by the animosity directed towards his former captain.

Schneiderlin said: 'I know it was hard for Adam to leave the club. He was very emotional about it and I don't know why the fans are so angry with him.

'He gave everything to this football club from the first moment he wore the shirt when he was in the youth team.

'People come and people go. That is part of your career. Adam is a good guy and people should not forget what he did for the club.'
