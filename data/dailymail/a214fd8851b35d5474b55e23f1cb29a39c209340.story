A door that came loose and fell off a plane mid-flight has
turned up on the roof of a California hotel.

The private plane involved in the mishap, which is now under
investigation, left Monterey Regional Airport about 3pm Thursday heading west.

The pilot reported hearing a 'pop' and promptly turned the
aircraft around to land.

It wasn't until he was back on the ground that he realised
the door was missing.

But it would be some 18 hours later - about 8am Friday morning - until the
door was discovered on the roof of the El Castell Motel in Monterey by a
contractor doing maintenance outside.

'The strange part is, nobody noticed it,' the motel's front
desk manager, A.J. Panchel, told The Salinas Calfiornian.

Lucky: The door that fell off a plane, of the same make as this one, on Thursday afternoon has been located on the roof of a hotel in Monterey, California

Scene: The missing door was found on the tiled roof of a hotel room here, the El Castell Motel in Monterey. No one was injured

Luckily, the motel room was unnocupied at the time and,
according to staff, no one reported hearing the door crashing onto the tile
roof.

The Police Department were called, who then notified the
Fire Department.

The door, weighing about 75 pounds, was then removed.

While the roof sustained some damage, the interior of the
motel was not affected.

The door came from a Beechcraft King Air, a common
twin-turboprop plane, said Thomas Greer, general manager of the Monterey
airport.

Mr Greer said he immediately contacted the Monterey County
Fairgrounds, which the plane was flying over at the time the pilot said he
noticed something was wrong.

Mr Greer also contacted the Coast Guard, waiting all of
Thursday afternoon and night for any news.

Finally word came on Friday morning.

Mr Greer said airport authorities were still to work out why
the door fell.

The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have been notified about the incident.

The NTSB will now investigate the mishap.

Mr Greer said that, over the course of his aviation career,
he had only dealt with two objects falling from a plane.

'You don't hear about it often,' he said.

'(But) anything that can come loose - somewhere, sometime -
will come loose.'
