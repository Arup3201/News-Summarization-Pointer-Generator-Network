Kingman’s place in the line-up for the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on October 18 has been thrown into doubt after Khaled Abdullah’s colt picked up a throat infection.

The John Gosden-trained four-time group one winner could be re-routed to the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Santa Anita in California if he is forced to swerve the big mile race on British Champions day which is now a target for Sunday’s Freddie Head-trained Prix du Moulin winner Charm Spirit.

Gosden, whose Pomology was second in the Prix Vermeille, said: ‘It is annoying. He is the only horse in the stable affected and has never had a sore throat before. His chances of running depend on how long he is on antibiotics.’

Richard Hannon’s Prix du Moulin runner-up could run in the longer Champion Stakes rather than the QE II Stakes if he goes to Champions day after jockey Richard Hughes advised upping the colt in distance.

After consulting the Queen on Sunday night, royal racing adviser John Warren could formally announce on Monday that her Estimate will not go for the Melbourne Cup.

Brown Panther, trained by Tom Dascombe and part-owned by Michael Owen, won Sunday's Irish Leger by six and a half lengths.
