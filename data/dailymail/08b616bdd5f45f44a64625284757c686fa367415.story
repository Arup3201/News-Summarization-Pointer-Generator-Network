Margaret Thatcher is pictured with Charles Haughey outside 10 Downing Street two years before the incident in question

Margaret Thatcher threatened to cancel a visit to Ireland because it was being ‘unfriendly’ about the Falklands War, newly declassified files reveal.

The then prime minister was in no mood to meet with taoiseach Charles Haughey – because Ireland planned to back calls for a ceasefire.

State documents show how, during one of the most critical stages of the war with Argentina, Britain pushed Ireland to abstain from a planned United Nations ceasefire resolution.

Ireland had let it be known it was in favour of ending military action.

An unnamed Irish diplomat at the UN sent a cable to Dublin warning about the threats from London after having lunch with the then Conservative foreign secretary Francis Pym.

At the meeting in June 1982, Mr Pym said he felt Anglo-Irish relations were ‘getting worse every day’.

The deterioration was particularly disappointing to Mrs Thatcher, who accepted the ‘unique relationship’ between the countries, he said.

The official told Dublin in the cable: ‘In her present mood he could not give any assurance that the PM would wish to have a meeting with the taoiseach, although he added that a week is, of course, a long time in  politics and things could change.’

The files, released into the National Archives under the 30-year rule, show Mr Pym asked Ireland to at least abstain from voting. But the diplomat wrote: ‘I gave him no hope of this.’

The diplomat also spoke to Sir Antony Acland, then head of the British diplomatic service.

The official told Dublin in the cable: 'In her present mood he could not give any assurance that the PM would wish to have a meeting with the taoiseach'

‘He hinted, without saying so bluntly, that the PM might find it politically difficult to visit Ireland this year if we continued to play a role seen by No 10 Downing Street as unfriendly to Britain,’ he wrote.

He added: 'I insisted we were in favour of a ceasefire leading to peace in the interests of all concerned, including the islanders and that it was this approach which had guided out actions at the UN.'

In the event, Britain vetoed the resolution, and two days later the Versailles summit supported its stance on the conflict.
