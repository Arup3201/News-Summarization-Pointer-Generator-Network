A 12 year old son's refusal to continue fitness training nearly cost him his life as his father has been accused of attempting to kill the child with a knife, a court heard. 

The boy pleaded that he 'didn't want to die' as his father is alleged to have whipped him with a belt at their Highgate hill home, in south Brisbane, at about 5.15m on Monday, The Courier Mail reported.

The father, who was charged with attempted murder and torture, is alleged to have said to his son that he 'wished he had never been born', the Brisbane Magistrates Court heard on Tuesday.

The police prosecutor said the child did not want to keep training but the father said he had to continue training or 'continue with the belting'.

Neighbours notified the police after hearing the boy's cries of distress.

The boy tried to escape  by scaling a neighbouring balcony during the attack where the father tried to have stab his son, the court heard.

'It's as if what (the father) was saying about wishing the child was never born was actually true,' the prosecutor said according to The Courier Mail.

'It's not a temper thing alone, he has had two clear occasions to calm down.' 

The 44 year old man was refused bail following concerns for the young boy's safety.
