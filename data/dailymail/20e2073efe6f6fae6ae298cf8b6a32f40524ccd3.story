Suspended: An eight-year-old boy was excluded from school for taking a knife into school after an argument with another pupil. Teachers found the table knife in his school bag (file picture)

An eight-year-old boy has been excluded fromÂ  primary school for taking a knife into class after he had an argument with another child.

Teachers were alerted to the fact that he had the piece of cutlery in his backpack after he told his classmates he had it.

Staff at the Christ Church Primary Academy in Folkestone, Kent then found the table knife in the young boy's school bag.

The pupil, who has not been identified, was immediately suspended from the school.

The boy admitted intentionally taking the blade into school and his parents were immediately 
called.

They were said to be 'shocked' and 'horrified' by what he had done.

Head teacher Jim Kreiselmeier sent a 
letter to all parents informing them of what had happened and reassuring
them there would not be a repeat of the incident.

It said: 'Unfortunately, a child brought a table knife to school after a disagreement with another child the previous evening.

'Although
the knife was brought to school, it did not leave the pupils bag until 
it was confiscated and was not seen by other pupils.

'There is no risk to any of the children and we will maintain vigilance to ascertain that no further incidents occur.'

The school confirmed that the 
youngster had been temporarily suspended, but would not 
confirm when he was due to return to classes.

Mr Kreiselmeier added: 'It was a very thoughtless action on his part, for whatever reason he did something very, very silly.

'We investigated the incident and found out the reason behind it, and it was because of a disagreement with another pupil.

'After calling his parents he was immediately removed from site.

Warning: The headteacher of Christ Church Primary Academy in Folkestone, Kent sent a letter to parents informing them of the incident

'There was no reason to think that the knife would have been used.

'But there's no rational reason as to why he should bring in the knife in the first place.'

A
spokesman for Kent Police confirmed they had been contacted regarding 
the incident but said it was in the hands of the school.

The
spokesman said: 'Christ Church Academy did inform us that an 
eight-year-old pupil had a knife in his bag but that no children were in
danger.

'The matter is or has been dealt with by the school itself.'
