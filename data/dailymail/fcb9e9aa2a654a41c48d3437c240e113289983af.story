Katie Couric has shot down reports that she will return to The Today Show when Savannah Guthrie goes on maternity leave.

Couric's afternoon talk show has been cancelled and is wrapping up its final tapings next month as she heads to Yahoo to start her new role as the site's first global news anchor.

Because of the break in her schedule, some unidentified sources said that she had been asked to return to her old early morning stomping grounds and fill in for Guthrie but she said Tuesday that she will never be returning.

Next gig: Katie Couric said that she does not plan to return to morning television and she's headed to Yahoo after her afternoon talk show finishes taping in June

'I don’t think so. No, no, no,' she said when asked by CNN's Bill Weir if she ever thought of returning to morning television.

'Sometimes I miss the gang.

'I had a wonderful 15 year run at the Today show, and I’m still in touch with them. So, you know, they’ll always have a special place in my heart.'

There was even speculation that should her temporary fill-in go well, she would be asked to stay on permanently. That wouldn't be the first time that such a move was pulled, however, since that is how Couric got the Today Show gig in the first place.

Old and new: Couric and Savannah Guthrie, seen together over the weekend at the White House Correspondents Dinner, have both been Matt Lauer's co-hosts for the Today Show

Couric sat in for then-co-host Deborah Norville when Norville was on maternity leave and Couric was given the position full time when she didn't return.

Given Couric's most recent denial, it doesn't look like the past will be repeating itself quite yet.

NBC News head Deborah Turness also shot down the speculation of a Couric-Lauer reunion on Wednesday.

'Savannah has been such a big part of the ‘Today’ show’s momentum over the last few months,' she told The New York Times.

'While she’s with her newborn we’ll keep that momentum going with our own homegrown talent with perhaps a few surprises mixed in.'
