The sad absence of Prince Philip from the final glorious tableaux marking the Diamond Jubilee meant the Queen had the opportunity to decide with whom to share the affection of the public on that last open carriage ride through the streets of London to Buckingham Palace.

She chose the former Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall.

The two women sat side by side, their comfortable level of intimacy plain to see. Prince Charles sat on the seat facing them. How true the old axiom that time changes everything.

 Charles

Some 14 years ago, just 12 months after that crash in Paris in which Princess Diana was killed, Charles went to see his mother.

He was looking for approval and 
support for his relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles. Since Diana’s 
death, his relationship with her had continued to be conducted in the 
shadows.

He wanted to be able to go out openly 
with Camilla, to be seen with her, to take her to the theatre and out to
 dinner with friends.

The Prince knew the Queen’s approval 
would help, and that the first step was to get her to soften her 
attitude towards his long-time mistress.

It was not a happy meeting. As a 
highly placed royal confidante told us then: ‘The Queen told her son she
 never wanted to talk about that wicked woman, and wanted nothing to do 
with her.’

Charles was devastated. He couldn’t 
understand why his mother had taken so bitterly against the woman he 
loved. Nor could he see that his request to the Queen so soon after 
Diana’s death was premature.

These were the days, of course, when 
memories of Princess Diana, accompanied by considerable public anger at 
the way she was treated, were still fresh in the nation’s mind.

Today, the only mention of the tragic 
Princess came four days before the Jubilee weekend from Prince William, 
in a touching TV interview recorded not here but in the U.S., where 
affection for — and understanding of — Diana remains high.

Here, the woman Diana described as the
 ‘third person’ in her marriage has not merely been accepted into the 
Royal Family. She has clearly turned into its most central figure after 
the Queen herself, a vital and trusted lynchpin between the young and 
the old.

During the four-day Jubilee weekend, 
Camilla has never been without a word: here, to the Duchess of 
Cambridge; there, to the Queen; an amusing aside with Prince Philip; a 
giggle with the young Princes.

Throughout the spectacle, she has been
 the most animated and relaxed figure in the Royal Family, plugged in to
 them all. The truth is that she has become — as we first saw as the 
Royals grouped with the Queen on board the Spirit of Chartwell on the 
Thames on Sunday — an integral element of the so-called ‘Magnificent 
Seven’.

These core VIP family figures, in addition to the Queen and Prince Philip, are Charles, Camilla, William, Kate and Harry.

So there was Camilla in the spotlight 
while Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne — who has always 
been frosty towards her elder brother’s wife — were consigned to the 
margins on other boats.

The reason? A new palace policy of a ‘slimmer’ family focusing on the monarchs and her direct heirs.

Harry, too, will probably disappear 
from this core group the moment William and Kate have a baby and the 
child is old enough to take his or her place in public.

Yesterday, not one of these 
‘relegated’ royals was even allowed on the Buckingham Palace balcony 
with the Queen when she excitedly took in the RAF Battle of Britain 
fly-past salute followed by the Red Arrows. No Anne. No Andrew. No 
Edward. Yet a smiling Camilla was there with the other principal royals.

How very different from the Queen’s 
Golden Jubilee a decade ago, when Diana had been dead a mere five years 
and Camilla was a peripheral presence, shepherded carefully out of the 
spotlight.

On that occasion, when there was a 
concert in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, and Charles went on stage 
to give his thanks and pay tribute to his mother, William and Harry were
 with him, but there was no sign of Camilla.

This time, on Monday night after the 
concert watched by tens of thousands round the Victoria Memorial and 
down the Mall, when the Prince again paid a warm tribute to ‘Mummy’, the
 Duchess of Cornwall was not only on stage with him, but standing 
alongside the Queen.

For Diana’s friends and millions of supporters, Camilla’s comfortable prominence is bound still to be painful.

What has to be said about the Duchess 
of Cornwall, however, is that since marrying the Prince of Wales in a 
civil ceremony at Windsor in April 2005, she has made a spirited effort 
to win over her detractors and has worked hard embedding herself as the 
wife of the heir to the throne.

Charles’s relaxed and jolly manner 
during the past few days can also be ascribed to Camilla’s influence. 
The raw humour and blue jokes that first attracted him to her at the 
start of their epic love affair 40 years ago still make him ‘giggle’.

His confidence and widely praised 
speech after Monday night’s concert is not unconnected to her perceived 
growing popularity with the people, even though many will never forgive 
her for her role in Diana’s tragedy.

‘No one should underestimate how proud
 the Prince is of her,’ says a friend. ‘He sees Camilla as a 
misunderstood woman who has stuck to her guns. This weekend he has 
derived great comfort and pleasure from the fact people have been 
applauding Camilla. It’s what he’s always wanted.’

The intervening years, however, have 
been difficult for the Queen, who has had to tread a delicate path 
between public animosity towards the woman Diana described as the 
‘rottweiler’ and her son’s refusal to give up the woman he loved. Under 
the circumstances, the Queen really didn’t have much choice, because the
 heir to the throne could hardly go on living indefinitely with a woman 
who was not his wife.

When they married seven years ago, the
 Queen clearly made up her mind to give them her support, hence her 
amusing speech at that Windsor Castle wedding breakfast in which the 
horse-racing enthusiast Queen welcomed the newlyweds ‘into the winners’ 
enclosure’.

Even the Queen could not have recognised the prescience of her words.

Since then, having earlier lost the 
wise and close counsel of the Queen Mother and her sister Princess 
Margaret, it is no surprise to long-serving courtiers that the mature 
and shrewd Camilla has turned herself into someone to whom the Queen 
feels she can talk.

Indeed, this has made Camilla the ultimate bridge — between Charles and his mother.

Whichever way you look at it, hers has certainly been a remarkable transformation from scarlet woman to royal Duchess.

And ultimately — who would seriously question it? — to be Queen one day.
