Gareth Bale has sounded a word of caution after Wales secured a valuable point in Belgium and declared their next match against Israel is 'like a cup final'.

Wales sit second in Group B and travel to surprise table-toppers Israel in March a point behind having played a game more.

The Real Madrid star said his country must not get 'carried away' by the hard-fought draw in Brussels but admitted that Welsh teams of the past would have crumbled and conceded late on.

'Don’t get me wrong, the draw wasn’t easy to come by,' Bale said. 'We showed what team spirit we’ve got.

'In previous years we definitely would have caved in but we showed what we are made of. 'We must not get carried away. At the moment it’s going our way, it’s all down to our work ethic, no luck is involved.

'We’ve all given 110 per cent, we all work hard on the training field. And we feel like we’re getting what we deserve.

'Belgium are still the team to beat for sure. They're a fantastic team - it was very difficult out there. 'To be able to come to a team ranked fourth in the world and get a result is fantastic for our confidence.

'It's something to build on and now we must keep plugging away. 'Isreal will be a huge game - but if we realistically want to qualify then every game is massive, like a final.

'We move on to the next camp and we'll be aiming to get the three points.'
