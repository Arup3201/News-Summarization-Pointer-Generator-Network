Eleven-year-old Olivia Estrella woke one morning to find a strange, intoxicated man sleeping beside her in her twin-sized bed.

Startled, Estrella slipped out of her bed around 7 a.m. on Saturday without waking the man and alerted her mother, who called 911 and rushed into her daughter’s bedroom with a metal rod to confront the intruder.

Estrella’s mother kept the intruder, who turned out to be a neighbor, in their Sacramento, California home until authorities arrived and arrested him on suspicions of burglary and child molestation.

The suspect, 25-year-old Havinder Badesha, claims he was so drunk that he thought he was breaking into his own home Friday night -- believing that he had locked himself out -- when he slipped into the Estrellas’ home through a window screen.

Badesha, who has been previously charged with driving under the influence, lives just five blocks from the Estrella family.

Breaking in: Badesha jumped a fence in the back yard of this home and slipped inside through a window

Olivia Estrella, 11, was startled to find Badesha, a man she had never met, sleeping in her twin-sized bed

‘He jumped the back fence and started walking all around, Mark Estrella, Olivia’s father, told Fox40 of Sacramento. ‘He tested all the windows, took off all the screens and finally found a window that was slightly ajar and managed to pry it open.’

Once inside the home, Badesha walked upstairs past the bedroom where the girl’s parents were sleeping, crept into Olivia Estrella’s bedroom and crawled under her covers, according to Sacramento police.

Estrella said he wasn’t at home when his wife called to tell him there was an intruder in the home.

‘I was going fast and thinking all the way home I know they’re safe, but what am I gonna do to this guy if I see him,’ he said.

Mark Estrella, the girl's father, said he is 
reinforcing the locks on all his doors and windows after an intruder 
crept into his daughter's bedroom overnight

He said his daughter has been ‘very brave’ but that she did not want to discuss the incident with reporters.

The man did not touch Olivia Estrella, so it’s likely the child molestation charges will be dropped, authorities said.

Estrella
said he has been working to reinforce all the locks on the home’s 
windows and doors to prevent another intruder from breaking in.
