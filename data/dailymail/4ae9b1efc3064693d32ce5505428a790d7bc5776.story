Russian President Vladimir Putin says gays should feel welcome at the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, but they must 'leave the children in peace'.

Mr Putin told volunteers today that gays visiting Sochi 'can feel calm and at ease,' and vowed that there would be no discrimination at the games.

But he emphasised that, according to a law banning homosexual 'propaganda' among minors, gays cannot express their views on gay rights issues to anyone under age.

Mr Putin and other politicians have defended the June propaganda law as a protection of child rights, but critics believe that the law discriminates against sexual minorities.

In the wake of international outcry against the bill, Russian authorities have put limits on the right to protest during the Sochi games, which run from February 7-23.

Last week the Orthodox Church in Russia demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships 
in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  

The
 demand comes less than a month before the start of the Winter Olympics 
in Sochi when a number of participants and visitors are expected to 
stage protests against laws banning the promotion of homosexuality to 
young people.

The spokesman for the church - which 
is seen as close to Putin - said Russia should not be dictated to by 
liberal Western values, and urged a referendum on a return to a Soviet 
law enacted by Stalin which criminalised homosexuality.

'There is no question that society should discuss this issue since we live in a democracy,' said Vsevolod Chaplin.   

'For this reason, it is 
precisely the majority of our people and not some outside powers that 
should decide what should be a criminal offence and what should not.'

He
 urged in an interview with pro-Kremlin Izvestia website:  'I am 
convinced that such sexual contacts should be completely excluded from 
the life of our society.

'If we manage to do this through moral pressure, all the better.

'But if we need to revert to assistance from the law, then let us ask the people if they are ready for this.'

Chaplin is seen as a powerful figure within the church and his call has been echoed by MPs.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond.  

'If you stage a referendum in Russia,
 90 percent would back both the death penalty and the idea of shooting 
all homosexuals,' said gay pride parade organiser Eduard Murzin.  

'By discriminating against minorities, the authorities want to deflect attention away from other problems.'

Clergyman Chaplin recently accused Western governments of being out of touch with values elsewhere in the world. 

'Western
 civilization still cannot realize that its model of social order is 
shared by the minority of people in the world,' he said.  

The demonstration in a Moscow cathedral by Pussy Riot was linked to the church's alleged close ties to Putin.  

Two singers were jailed after the protest which Putin branded 'hooliganism'.
