The Earl of Cardigan has revealed he was forced to shower at a gym and wash his baby daughter in a sink as trustees fought to sell his family's £16million estate.

For two years, the 61-year-old was embroiled in a bitter legal battle over the sale of Tottenham House in Wiltshire as he tried to persuade the courts to give him permission to lease the Grade I Listed estate to a hotelier. 

During the acrimonious proceedings, the Earl, whose family name is David Brudenell-Bruce, lived off a weekly state allowance of £71 and was forced to move his family into a small lodge on the estate's grounds.

Unable to even heat the cottage, he took to bathing his daughter, now one, in a sink and he and his second wife, Joanne, travelled to a local leisure centre to shower. 

'Because the trustees would not release any money we have been forced to bathe our one-year-old daughter in the sink and we have been forced to take daily showers in the local leisure centre.' he told the Daily Telegraph.

The Earl said the sale would be 'galling' for his father

'They cut off my income, deprived me of my job and had me living in complete penury every since.'  

Last week the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the trustees and ordered that it be sold for £11.5million. 

Trustees had been trying to sell the property in Wiltshire as, they claimed, much of it lay decaying having been unoccupied for years.  

Last year a deal was reportedly made with a property developer to sell the most valuable part of the estate, Tottenham House, with the Earl and his son, Viscount Savernake, the beneficiaries. 

But Lord Cardigan argued it was worth more than the £11.5million offer, despite an estate agent valuing the property at closer to £8million. 

He launched an appeal to block the sale, pleading that the house be kept within his family. 

But this week a panel of judges ruled it was in his best interest to sell the house.  

Speaking of how the sale will affect his father, the 9th Marquess of Ailesbury, he said: 'To hear it will be sold against his wishes in his 89th year will be very galling for him.'
