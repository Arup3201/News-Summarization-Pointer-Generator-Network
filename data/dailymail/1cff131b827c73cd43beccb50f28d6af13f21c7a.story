A Japanese woman is suing the country's most powerful Yakuza godfather in a bid to recoup £115,000 in protection money she paid him over 12 years.

The unidentified restaurateur says Kenichi Shinoda, chief of the feared Yamaguchi-gumi gang, owes her a refund for the money she paid out to gang members affiliated to his group.

As head of the cartel, Shinoda is liable for any damage caused to her or her business by employees under his command, her lawyers claim, citing an anti-organised crime law that was revised in 2008.

Many in Japan have lauded the woman for her remarkable bravery in taking on a man who once spent 13 years in prison for the murder of a rival Yakuza boss with a samurai sword.

The woman, from Nagoya, also claims that when she refused to pay the bung in 2008, Yamaguchi-gumi henchmen threatened to burn down her restaurant.

This is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind in Japan, Kyodo news agency reported.

The former restaurant owner is reported to have paid a total of 
10.85 million yen ($109,000; £72,000) in in total. The rest, lawyers say, will cover damages.

Police figures suggest that the Yamaguchi-gumi make up 
over 40 per cent of Japan's organised criminal underworld, AFP news agency 
reported.

Kenichi Shinoda, also known as 
Shinobu Tsukasa, began his yakuza career in 1962 when he joined the 
Hirota-gumi, a Nagoya-based Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate.

The Yakuza is a collective term given to Japan's organised crime syndicates.

It is estimated that the Yakuza has over 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs, but together they make the largest organised crime group in the world.

Numerous films have been made about yakuza crime, culture and practice, including the 1993 movie American Yakuza (pictured)

They are known for their controlled organisation and strict codes of conduct, which involves punishments such as 'yubitsume' for members who break the rules.

The tradition of 'yubitsume', beginning with the first joints of the left hand little finger comes from the Japanese way of holding a sword with 'yubitsume' intended to weaken the Yakuza member’s sword grip.

The number of members has been on the decline since the Japanese Government introduced the Anti-Organized Crime Law in 1992 and as recent as last year, the US Treasury Department froze assets for the largest Yakuza ‘family’, the Yamaguchi-gumi.

But his reputation for violence, loyalty and shrewd business acumen saw him rise fast up the ranks.

Perhaps most famously, Shinoda was convicted of murdering a rival yakuza boss in the early 1970s, with a samurai sword. He was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in prison.

But he is seen as an unusual Japanese crime boss, who likes to keep a lower profile than some of his rivals.

He insisted on taking the train to 
his induction ceremony instead of a chauffeured limousine and reportedly
stopped in a street noodle restaurant on the way to the lavish yakuza 
banquet arranged in his honour.

In November, police revealed one in five Japanese companies shaken down by the yakuza gangsters ended up paying them off.

A
study released by Japan's National Police Agency found that of the 
companies that answered the survey, at least five had paid more than 
5million yen ($61,000) to meet the demands of yakuza extortionists.

The survey gives a good indication that Japan's 'nine-fingered economy' is still very much in business.

Police sources acknowledge on 
background that there may be more companies who actually paid off the 
yakuza than were willing to admit it in a police survey.

In October of 2011, it became a crime
in Japan to make payments to the yakuza or utilize their services under
the organized crime exclusionary ordinances.

The NPA has repeatedly warned people not to give in to yakuza extortion demands.

Despite that, of the 2,885 companies that participated, 337 or 11.7 per cent reported run-ins with yakuza shakedowns.

Of those companies approached by the yakuza, 62 companies or 18 per cent gave into the demands, The Atlantic Wire reported. Police said this figure is probably only the tip of the iceberg.

For the companies approached by the yakuza, more than half (185) were pressed for payments or services in the last year.
