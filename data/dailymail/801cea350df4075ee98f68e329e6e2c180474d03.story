Opemipo Jaji is accused of raping an 11-year-old girl in a park in Enfield

A teenager accused of snatching an
11-year-old girl off the street and repeatedly raping her today claimed
he is 'not capable of doing anything as despicable and heartless'.

Opemipo Jaji, 18, said at the time of the attack he was at a youth club working on a backing track for a song.

He told a jury at the Old Bailey: 'I wrote the song after I heard a girl killed herself from bullying. I wrote the song hoping things would get better.'

Jaji admits he was on the same bus as the victim and got off at the same stop.

But he claims he then went on to a youth club in Enfield, North London, for a recording session.

The trainee chef said he went to Jubilee Park 
later that evening to compose music but left after 10 minutes because he
saw police at the gate.

Jaji, of Edmonton, north London, denies raping the girl in November, last year.

The court heard the girl was walking home from school when she was dragged into the park and subjected to a three-hour rape ordeal.

She ran home and police were called.

Traces of her blood were found on 
Jaji’s white trainers and bag which he says were from when he sat down 
on the grass later that evening.

Opemipo Jaji, 18, told an Old Bailey 
jury that when he previously mugged and sexually assaulted another 
schoolgirl in an almost identical attack two years earlier it had been 'childhood stupidity.'

The trainee chef claimed that 
since the first attack he’s been forced to grow up, and was planning to 
set up his own catering firm. He also claimed he was to appear on BBC TV
talent show The Voice.

The court heard Jaji accounts for every second of the day so he 'would not get into trouble.'

Jaji denies he was the rapist who 
grabbed the girl after she got off a bus and walked through a north 
London park on a Friday night last November.

The girl was forced to strip from 
her school uniform and had a woollen glove pushed in her mouth to stop 
her screaming as she was subjected to a terrifying three-hour ordeal.

Her injuries were so bad she had to spend four days in hospital.

The jury were told just 21 months 
earlier, aged 16, Jaji grabbed a schoolgirl from a bus stop, dragged her
to a secluded area on a housing estate, stripped her of her school 
uniform and used her school tie to gag her.

He later pleaded guilty to robbery and sexual assault.

Today, Jaji said: 'It was just childhood stupidity.

'Since I’ve been in prison and out, I’ve been forced to grow up.

'Since then I have sorted myself out. I
got an apprenticeship as a chef while being paid £10 an hour, I was two
weeks from starting my own catering business. I was suppose to be on 
The Voice TV show on BBC.

'I am just not capable of doing something as despicable and heartless as this. To be honest, I don’t know what to say.'

Terrifying assault: The girl finally reached home at 8pm and was taken to hospital for surgery

'I have done everything to keep myself
out of trouble. Every single day of my week is planned out to the 
letter by me. That’s just because I don’t really like too much free time
because you get into trouble.'

He told the jury he had been on a 
bus with the schoolgirl and had handed her back her travel pass when it 
fell to the floor, explaining why his fingerprints were on it.

He also said he went inside Jubilee 
Park later that evening to compose music in his 'favourite spot' but 
left after 10 minutes because he saw police at the gate.

He explained blood belonging to the 
girl found on the inside of his boxer shorts, around the crotch and zip 
area of his trousers, on and inside his upper long johns, t-shirt, polo 
shirt, trainers and on his Adidas sports bag must have been picked up 
when he sat down on the grass.

However, the jury heard when 
police searched Jaji’s home they found a book on his bunk bed called 
“Nobody Cares” about a little girl who is repeatedly raped.

Also on his bed was a picture of a seven-year-old dressed in 
tennis clothes cut out and pasted on a piece of cardboard. They also 
found a page of small ads searching for childminder.

Rosina Cottage, prosecuting, accused Jaji of wanting case to go to trial so he could watch the girl having to relive her ordeal.

He replied: 'What does that do for me exactly?'

Ms Cottage said: 'You are sexually interested in very little girls and manipulate and control them.

'What better way than to control a
little girl than make her come to court and give evidence? So you could
watch the DVD and how she explained what you have done to her.'

Jaji replied: 'I have not committed this crime.'

She accused Jaji of not being able
to 'resist' attacking the girl when he followed her off the bus and it 
was 'no coincidence' she was repeatedly raped at his 'favourite' spot 
inside the park.

He says he handed the schoolgirl her 
travel pass when it fell to the floor which explains why his fingerprints were found on it.

Jaji of Osward Place, Edmonton, north London, denies a single count of rape.

The trial continues.
