With their golden age behind them Spain get ready to go again on Thursday night in Paris against Didier Deschamps’ French team. With Xabi Alonso and Xavi Hernandez recently retired and the horror-show memories of losing to Holland and Chile in Brazil still fresh in the mind can they rebuild in time to be a force at France 2016? We answer some key questions. 

What is the mood like in their first game since the World Cup failure?

Melancholic. Wednesday morning’s papers were full of the team photos of the last Spain side that played in the Stade de France. David Villa, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Gerard Pique, Alvaro Arbeloa, Victor Valdes and Nacho Monreal all started in that crucial World Cup qualifier that Spain won 1-0 last year but will not be on the pitch when the game kicks off on Wednesday.

Villa, Xabi and Xavi have all retired and will be impossible to replace. Pique’s self-confessed dip in form and fitness will also create a huge problem if it continues because there are no central defenders on the horizon.

Sounds grim, maybe Vicente del Bosque and Roy Hodgson need to swap squads for a couple of games so Spanish fans can get things back into perspective?

Well exactly. Group stage elimination was hard to take after winning three tournaments on the bounce and some all-time greats have since quit, but still if you look at Spain’s proposed starting line-up you would probably say that eight of the 11 would walk into the England team. Hart, Cahill and Sterling might keep out Casillas, Albiol and Pedro. But Alba, Ramos, Azpilicueta, Koke, Busquets, Fabregas, Silva and Costa would all make Roy’s cut.

So it’s not all doom and gloom; what’s the grand plan?

Del Bosque has the same dilemma he had before the World Cup. He does not want to betray the short-passing game that gave the team its unprecedented success but some of the team’s most important players actually play a slightly more direct game. And he needs to recognise that.

Players such as?

Centre-forward Diego Costa, his Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas, and his former Atletico Madrid team-mates Koke and Raul Garcia all favour a slightly more direct approach.

But Spain are not going to start playing like Chelsea or Atletico Madrid?

There is still a big Barcelona influence with Pique, Alba, Iniesta and Busquets integral, but Del Bosque can’t watch videos of Fabregas setting-up Costa to score every weekend in the Premier League and not want to incorporate that into his new Spain side.

A big Barça presence still then, but also a big Premier League one?

Very much so and if Casillas’ World Cup form were to continue and he were to lose his Real Madrid place then Spain would look to a new number one – probably Manchester United’s David de Gea. Adding a Premier League keeper to the names of Azpilicueta, Fabregas, Silva and Costa would mean almost half the team would be based in England.

Down to the nuts and bolts then: what formation will Del Bosque play? Who are the undroppables? And where are the doubts?

It seems 4-3-3 will be system with Costa at centre-forward, Ramos at centre-back and Busquets in centre-midfield, the three players its hardest to see being left out. Silva and Pedro are expected to play either side of the Chelsea centre-forward and Koke and Fabregas either side of Busquets.

Andres Iniesta and Thiago Alcantara will both need to come back into the equation when fit again. Defensively Del Bosque is desperately looking for alternatives to Pique and could try both Barcelona’s Marc Bartra and Athletic Bilbao’s Miquel San Jose on Wednesday. 

Azpilicueta and Alba will be pushed by Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal and Atletico Madrid’s Juanfran at full-back. And that just leaves Casillas trying to get back to his best but under pressure from De Gea.

Will it be enough to see them reign again?

It will be enough to see them challenge again. Matching the team that had Villa, Carles Puyol, Xabi and Xavi as its spine will be much more difficult.
