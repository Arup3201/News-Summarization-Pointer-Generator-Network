An army of more than 500 Caped Crusaders have smashed the world record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Batman.

Employees from Calgary-based energy firm Nexen donned their black outfits, masks and capes to set a new Guinness World Record.

Stunned onlookers took to Twitter to post pictures of the bat invasion at Century Park - where other comic book icons including the Joker and Robin made an appearance.

After five minutes, the staff members beat the previous Guinness World Record of 250 novelty batmans 

Their efforts were rewarded after 542 members of staff dressed up as the famous comic book hero to crush the previous record of 250.

Fang Zhi, CEO of Nexen Energy ULC, said: 'Our employees are true super heroes.

'We're very proud of the teamwork and community spirit they've demonstrated in supporting this initiative.

'Our goal was to show a unified spirit in kicking off Nexen's annual United Way campaign and also to raise awareness for United Way of Calgary and Area.

'We needed 250 or more participants to set the Batman record and I'm very proud to say that we've more than doubled that figure.'

In 2011, 437 of the company's employees dressed as Superman for another World Record success 

The superheros were made to wear a full body outfit in black, a cape, mask and a yellow belt and had to stand together for a five minute countdown to claim the record.

The firm are no strangers to smashing records after earning the title of largest gathering of people dressed as Superman in 2011 with 437 employees wearing the Man of Steel outfit.

Nexen Energy staged the stunt, on September 18, to kick off their charity campaign which carries the slogan 'From Suits to Superheroes'.
