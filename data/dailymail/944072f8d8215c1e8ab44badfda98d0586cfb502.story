West Bromwich Albion U21 coach Jimmy Shan has emerged as a surprise candidate for the vacant post at Notts County.

The League One strugglers sacked Shaun Derry and assistant Greg Abbott on Monday as they look to stop their slide. Notts are only one place above the relegation zone on goal difference after Saturday's 4-1 loss at MK Dons.

They have won just three games in 24 league matches since November.

How the bottom of League One is shaping up

Former Nottingham Forest boss Paul Hart is the early favourite to replace Derry but Shan, 35, is regarded as one of the game's brightest up and coming coaches. He is credited with helping bring through Albion prospects such as Saido Berahino, Iasiah Brown, Chris Wood, George Thorne and Yan Dhanda who was snapped up from Albion's academy by Liverpool.

He worked with FA director of elite development Dan Ashworth and has progressed through the coaching ranks since moving to the Hawthorns as U11s coach in 2006.

He was promoted from his role at U18 development coach last summer with Albion technical director Terry Burton saying: 'James was the obvious choice to fill the role. He knows the players well having worked with them and helped progress them over the years.'

Former Cheltenham boss Mark Yates, James Beattie, Darren Ferguson and ex-Coventry manager Steven Pressley are also in the frame.Â
