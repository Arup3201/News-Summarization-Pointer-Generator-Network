Fulham striker Marcello Trotta is being lined up for another loan move away from Craven Cottage, this time to League One strugglers Barnsley.

The Italy U21 international has had previous loan spells with Brentford, Watford and Wycombe in recent seasons and is ready to go out on loan again in search of more game time.

Barnsley are finding it difficult to adapt to life in League One following their relegation last season and are currently fourth from bottom in England's third tier.

The Italian U21 striker scored 22 goals in 70 appearances during his two seasons on loan at Brentford

Trotta cuts a popular figure following the Bees' League One Play Off Semi Final victory over Swindon in 2013

Danny Wilson is out for more striking options after just two wins from Barnsley's first nine League One games

The Tykes face high-flying Rochdale on Saturday and manager Danny Wilson is keen to bolster his forward options to lift his team up the table.

Fulham face Bolton tonight but Trotta has yet to figure for them this season.
