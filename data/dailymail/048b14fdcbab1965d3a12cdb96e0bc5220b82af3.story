Councils have blown thousands of pounds recruiting X-Factor cast-offs and Z-list reality television stars to switch on their Christmas lights this winter.

Former talent show winner Matt Cardle was paid £5,000 to switch on Basildon's Christmas lights last month.

He also signed a deal believed to be worth £4,000 to switch on the lights in South Ayrshire - but missed his flight up to Scotland because he was 'stuck in traffic'. As a result, he got paid nothing.

Organisers had to scramble in former Britain's Got Talent winner Jai McDowall as a last minute replacement.

Fortunately, he had plenty of time on his hands after being ditched by his record label.

Councils across the country have blown
 £1.8million since the general election in May 2010 hiring celebrities, a
 MailOnline investigation under the Freedom of Information Act has 
revealed.

South Tyneside Council spent £285,600 alone hiring celebrities for free concerts in an effort to give the area a boost over the last three years.

Local authorities 
have blown taxpayers money to hire stars to turn up at cheesy staff 
awards ceremonies, sports centre opening ceremonies and public events.

The figures were branded 'astonishing' by critics as they have come at a time when budgets have been slashed.

The
 total spend could be far higher as 98 out of 434 councils surveyed by 
the MailOnline failed to provide a response to the request.

In Perth, Z-list TOWIE 'star' Mark Wright was given £7,000 plus £132 for flights and £150 for travel - all for just one hour of work.

He turned on the Christmas lights but decided he was too 'tired' to meet hundreds of fans who queued outside a restaurant.

Instead, his team invited just 30 people at the front of the queue along to the three-star Mercure hotel in Perth where he spent half an hour signing autographs before swiftly flying home.

Former Westlife star Brian McFadden - who was famous in the 1990s - was paid £2,500 by Denbighshire Council, in Wales, to perform six songs and turn on the lights.

And the crowds in Gravesham, Kent, could be forgiven for asking 'who?' when an unfamiliar face hosted a Festive Cake Bake Event last month.

Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off in 2011, was paid £1,500 to turn up.

Shamed broadcaster Stuart Hall was paid £4,800 to open a white water course in Stockton, Durham.

The 83-year-old, who is currently serving a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 girls over a period of nearly 20 years, was arrested months after making his appearance in March 2012.

The Queen also attended the event at the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee White Water Course.

And in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, Rolf Harris was paid £738 to re-open the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum and Art Gallery.

The 83-year-old television entertainer has since been charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four charges of making indecent images of a child.

He is due to stand trial next year.

Chloe Sims from TOWIE was paid £5,000 and Matthew Wolfenden from Emmerdale received £3,500 to promote road safety.

The pair were filmed accelerating on a runway before braking sharply to demonstrate to young drivers just how long it took to stop their car.

They were used in a cheesy Valentine's Day Road Safety Campaign and videos of their 'road test' were published on YouTube.

Five councils across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire shared the cost of the project.

In a press release put out by Road Safety GB, Matthew Wolfenden was quoted as saying: 'Anyone can drive fast - you stick the pedal to the floor and go.

'The skill is in stopping and your reactions to stopping and to the cars around you.'

One of the biggest names to be hired was Brian Blessed who attended a walking festival twice - at a cost of more than £11,000 to Isle of Wight Council.

In 2010, he was paid £5,967 including expenses to appear at the annual event - and then £5,500 plus £250 expenses to attend the same event this year,

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said that councils should stop wasting money on minor celebrities.

He said: 'This is an astonishing bill for taxpayers to foot. Everyone wants to enjoy Christmas and lights in town centres are often part of the festivities, but that doesn't mean hard-pressed families should have to fork out for minor celebrities to come and switch them on.

'If businesses genuinely believe having Z-listers turn on the lights helps bring shoppers to the area, perhaps they could all stick some money in the kitty themselves.

'Councils are dealing with tighter budgets and have to cut out wasteful spending like this.'

A spokesman for Perth and Kinross Council said that hiring Mark Wright from TOWIE got more people to go shopping in the town centre.

'The decision to pay fees to attract a top line-up of entertainment for the Perth Christmas lights festival has been totally vindicated by the overwhelming success of the event,' he said.

'Around 90,000 people visited Perth on Saturday 23 November, with 26,000 in the city centre during the peak hour of 5-6pm when the switch-on took place.

'Not only did we see a 73 per cent increase in footfall for the day compared to last year, but also significantly improved footfall in the days leading up to the event.'

Payday: The BBC's 'voice of athletics' Paul Dickenson was paid £1,500 to interview David Weir - while the Paralympic star gave up his time for free

A Paralympic hero opened a council sports centre for free - while a BBC commentator was paid £1,500 to interview him at the event.

David Weir - who was one of the stars of the 2012 London games - opened the Westcroft Leisure Centre in Sutton, south London for free after it underwent an £11million refurbishment.

But while the disabled athlete gave up his time for free, Paul Dickenson, who is known as the BBC's voice of athletics, pocketed a fee to appear on stage at the event in February.

David Weir, who is known as the Weirwolf, has won six Paralympic gold medals including four in London last summer.

He has also won the London marathon a record-breaking six times after being born with a spinal 
condition that left him unable to use his legs.

The athlete lives in Sutton and regularly trains at the council's facilities so was happy to give his time up for free.

Paul Dickenson on the other hand is a retired hammer-thrower who competed in the Olympics in 1976 and 1980 before joining the BBC after his retirement.

As well as commentating on athletics he commentated on the BBC's heavily-criticised coverage of the Diamond Jubilee Thames River Pageant last year.

At one point during his commentary, he said: 'Tower Bridge is about as iconic as it gets'.

Mr Dickenson, Mr Weir and town mayor Sean Brennan all appeared on stage together at the sports centre opening.

A spokesman for Paul Dickenson refused to comment.

A spokesman for Sutton London Borough Council said: 'Paul Dickenson hosted the reopening of the Westcroft Leisure Centre in February following a major upgrade which included new sports facilities and a new library.

'His role included being the compere, giving a speech and interviewing David Weir.

'This is the only time in the past three years that we have paid for a celebrity to host an event.

'In this case, the cost was deemed worthwhile because the event promoted the new facilities to a wide audience and encouraged families to lead healthier lives as part of our Olympic legacy ambitions.'

A council spent nearly £300,000 hiring celebrities to perform at free concerts in just over three years, figures have revealed.

South Tyneside Council paid X-Factor 'stars' Stacey Solomon, Joe McElderry, Little Mix, Gareth Gates, Matt Cardle and Little Mix to appear at the annual event.

Critics said the day-long parties are of dubious benefit to the area - at a time when other council-run services are cut back.

The authority has axed 1,200 jobs and been forced to make £48million of savings since 2010 - but the taxpayer-funded knees up has escaped the chop.

The council hosts the free Bent Park Sunday Concert each year in an effort to boost tourism.

The authority refused to give a full breakdown of how much each act was paid and claimed it was 'confidential' and 'personal data'.

MailOnline explained to them that other councils had released the data in full and had not claimed it could be kept secret.

Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: 'For a council in that part of the world to be spending that kind of money is conspicuous.

'They may try and argue that spending that money on concerts will cheer people up. The key issue is accountability for spending public money.'

The council spent £54,850 on hiring celebrities in 2010, £48,950 in 2011, £51,000 in 2012 and £130,800 this year.

Although they released a full list of names of everyone who was paid to show up - they did not give a breakdown of the fees.

A spokesman for the council said: 'The Council stages a hugely popular summer festival, attracting around 100,000 visitors to our borough every year.

'Tourism supports thousands of jobs in South Tyneside, and visitors to our seafront festival spent an estimated £1.3million with local businesses last year alone.

'It would not be appropriate to publish details of the fees paid to individual performers. If the Council published details of a commercial agreement that we have been able to secure at an exceptional rate, it will affect future negotiations and earnings elsewhere for the artists and therefore make performers in general less willing to agree to special deals.'
