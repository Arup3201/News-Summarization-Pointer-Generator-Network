A restaurant worker was left for dead after he was battered by three masked men wielding a baseball bat. 

Jamil Ahmed was left with a bleed on the brain and needed hospital treatment for two weeks after the brutal assault in Sparkbrook, Birmingham, on December 15 last year  

Detectives believe the 27-year-old was deliberately targeted as a result of a 'grudge' because the masked gang didn't steal anything.

Mr Ahmed was so badly injured he has been unable to return to his restaurant job.

Police have now released a shocking picture of Mr Ahmed taken in hospital after the vicious assault in a bid to track down his assailants.

It shows him sitting in a hospital bed with a white bandage over his head and blood covering his face.

Detective Constable Michelle Akers, from West Midlands Police, said the investigation had so far been unable to identify those responsible or confirm a motive for the beating.

She added: 'This was a targeted attack, nothing was stolen and it appears Mr Ahmed has been assaulted by someone with a grudge against him, but precisely what's prompted it remains unclear.

'There can be no justification for an assault of this nature.

'It was a cowardly attack by three people, armed with baseball bats and with their faces covered. Mr Ahmed stood no chance of protecting himself and has been left with lasting physical, emotional and psychological scarring.

'This has happened during a busy time of day on Ladypool Road in full view of members of the public.

'Somebody must have seen something, or suspects who is involved, and I would appeal to their consciences to come forward with information.' 

A police trawl of local CCTV cameras reveals one offender was wearing a black face covering, gloves, a long-sleeved grey top, and grey Adidas tracksuit bottoms with light blue stripes on the side of the legs.

Anyone with information is urged to call DC Michelle Akers at West Midlands Police on the 101 number or call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
