Monty Don has hit out at the BBC for replacing his gardening show with 'cheap' coverage of snooker.

Gardeners' World will not be broadcast in its regular slot at 8.30 on BBC Two tonight because of the semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship.

And lovers of the show, which recently pulled in 2.6million viewers, have taken to the internet to complain about their interests being repeatedly sidelined in favour of sport.

As well as taking a break for the snooker every May, Gardeners' World is usually displaced by wall-to-wall coverage of Wimbledon in June and July.

Criticism: Monty Don has slammed the BBC for replacing Gardeners' World with snooker coverage

Mr Don, 57, complained on Twitter that the cancellation of his programe was a 'crazy hiatus' which was 'bound to annoy' his audience - adding, 'and me'.

He continued: 'Total lack of interest in programme or audience by schedulers.'

The Bank Holiday weekend is usually one of the busiest times for gardeners, and millions were hoping to tune in for Mr Don's tips on how to take advantage of the warming weather.

Viewer Bryan Appleyard tweeted: 'They should be made aware that the whole point of a show like GW is continuity.'

The presenter replied: 'Exactly... but few if anyone in BBC management understands that. Can't see football being randomly dropped.'

Other fans have called from the programme to be expanded beyond its half-hour timeslot, with Roz Smith tweeting: 'Why isn't GW longer? At least an hour. Why does snooker... any sport ALWAYS take precedence over GW?'

Mr Don tweeted: 'Because they are cheap.'

Ms Smith said she wanted the BBC to broadcast more gardening coverage, but Mr Don said: 'I am afraid the chances of this are low. GW is currently seen as more or less fulfilling the gardening remit.'

Former Gardeners' World presenter urged fans to take action, saying: 'Write a letter to the Beeb saying what you want to see - tweets are too easily ignored. Good luck!'

Writer Matthew Appleby, from magazine Horticulture Week, accused the BBC of letting down the nation's gardeners.

Replacement: Mr Don's show takes an annual break for the World Snooker Championships

'The bad weather this year has meant it has been a tough season for Britain's 20million garden owners,' he said.

'And now, just as spring has finally sprung and Gardeners' World gets its best audience in years, the BBC is dropping the show for snooker again.

'The BBC's sole gardening show, which only lasts half an hour, should be given priority at the peak of the gardening season.

'They are short-changing licence fee payers who like gardening.'

In the past, BBC garden makeover shows like Ground Force, starring Alan Titchmarsh and Charlie Dimmock, have attracted up to 12million viewers.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Gardeners' World is broadcast across the year, breaking only for major events.

'The transmission of sporting events is dependent on their dates, so it is therefore necessary to move all types of programming, not just of the gardening type, around in the schedule and this is done with minimum disruption.'
