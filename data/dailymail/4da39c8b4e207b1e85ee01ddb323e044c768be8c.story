Mark Clattenburg is being investigated by referees’ chief Mike Riley after Southampton accused him of ‘abusing and insulting’ their captain, the England star Adam Lallana.

Sportsmail can reveal that the extraordinary incident occurred in Southampton’s  2-1 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park last Sunday.

Saints have written to the Premier League asking that Clattenburg is not appointed as an official for any of their matches until the investigation is over.

Clattenburg has a controversial style and it is understood the alleged insult was directed at Lallana after the referee turned down Southampton penalty appeals late in the game.

Stunned: Lallana could not believe Clattenburg was not pointing to the penalty spot

Last
 season, Clattenburg was accused by Chelsea of racially abusing their 
midfield player John Mikel Obi during a fiery Premier League clash 
against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge.

An FA inquiry concluded 
there was no case to answer and Clattenburg was back in charge of a 
Chelsea game six months after he had been accused of calling Mikel a 
monkey.

On Saturday, Clattenburg will officiate the high-profile FA Cup third-round tie at the Emirates between Arsenal and Tottenham. At his Friday press conference, Arsene Wenger said: 'I would be disappointed if he isn't the referee. You are innocent till proven guilty.'

Lallana
 confronted Clattenburg at Goodison after his cross was met by the hand 
of Everton defender Antolin Alcaraz. The referee turned down Southampton
 appeals for a penalty.

Fuming: Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino let rip over the decision not to award a penalty

At his Friday press conference, Everton manager Roberto Matinez responded to the story: 'That's the first time I have heard that. I thought Mark Clattenburg had a very good game in terms of controlling the players and his manner.

'I don't think that that was the case. That's the first time I've heard any comment about that.’

According to sources close to the incident, 
Clattenburg spoke to the player in a manner that is ‘not what you might 
expect of one of the game’s top officials’.

Saints manager Mauricio 
Pochettino was furious with Clattenburg after the game and claimed the 
South Coast club should have been awarded two spot-kicks.

But 
Southampton, who followed up their loss at Everton with a 3-0 defeat by 
Chelsea at St Mary’s on New Year’s Day, have taken Pochettino’s 
complaints a step further by writing to the Professional Game Match 
Officials Ltd board.

Riley is investigating the matter, but PGMOL and
 the Premier League refused to comment.

Merseyside mayhem: Clattenburg sent off Everton's Tony Hibbert during a fiery clash with Liverpool in 2007

One that got away: Clattenburg did not send Dirk Kuyt off despite a lunge at Phil Neville at Goodison Park - the Dutchman went on to score two penalties as Liverpool beat their Merseyside rivals 2-1 back in 2007

Riley is duty-bound 
to speak with Clattenburg about Southampton’s claims and they are 
expected to respond to the club’s letter within the next few days.

Clattenburg is well known in the game for responding to verbal abuse from players with some choice phrases of his own.

After the match at Goodison, Pochettino complained bitterly about Clattenburg’s handling of the game.

The
 Southampton manager said: ‘These things need to be said and I am 
actually defending my club because it is my club and if I don’t talk I 
am going to be seen as if I am dumb or I don’t care about my club.

‘I
 don’t mean any disrespect against any referees but anyone watching the 
game can see there were two clear penalties that weren’t given or should
 have been given.

Accusation: Chelsea claimed that Clattenburg had abused Chelsea's John Mikel Obi during a game last season

Cleared: Clattenburg returned to refereeing after investigations found him not guilty of any wrong-doing

Southampton assistant manager Perez has vowed Saints will not let the situation affect their preparations for hosting Burnley on Saturday. Refusing to go into detail on their complaint to PGMOL, Perez said he expects the club to find out more information in the next few days.

'I won't talk about this situation, I prefer to stay away from this and just focus on the game on Saturday," he said.

'This type of situation doesn't help us in this moment, for this game, it's away, and we'll see in the next couple of days what's happening with this.

'I read it this morning; when you are in the games sometimes you can see or hear something, but history has led me to stay away from these things.'

‘That would have changed the game completely but we weren’t given them and, of course, we are angry and upset about this.

‘I
 am saying that should not be forgotten in the overall analysis of the 
game and they need to be said. We don’t want to be judged by our young, 
handsome, good-looking players. We just want what’s fair. We can be 
a******s as well.’

Incredibly, last Sunday’s match was 
Clattenburg’s first appointment at Goodison Park since his questionable 
handling of the Merseyside derby won 2-1 by Liverpool in October 2007.

On
 that occasion he sent off Everton’s Tony Hibbert, allowed Liverpool’s 
Dirk Kuyt to escape after he launched a kung-fu kick at Phil Neville and
 ignored a penalty appeal when Jamie Carragher clashed with Joleon 
Lescott.

This weekend Clattenburg will be officiating Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at the Emirates between Arsenal and Tottenham.

MERSEY MADNESS, OCT 2007In the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, Clattenburg looked ready to book Everton’s Tony Hibbert but, after apparently consulting Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard, sent the defender off. He failed to show Dirk Kuyt a red card for a waist-high lunge and denied the hosts what looked a penalty in the final minutes. He did not referee an Everton match for five years and the game against Southampton was his first return to Goodison Park.

SUSPENSION, JAN 2009After the winding-up of one of his businesses in the High Court, Clattenburg was suspended from refereeing and finally sacked by the referees’ governing body, the PGMO, for breaching his contract. He was accused of having business debts of nearly £200,000 and told he would never referee again, but he was reinstated that February after clearing his name.

BASHING BELLAMY, DEC 2009In a match between Bolton and Manchester City, Clattenburg sent off Craig Bellamy for two bookable offences — dissent and diving. At half-time, he allegedly said to members of the City staff: ‘How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?’

SEETHING SPURS, OCT 2010The referee had already caused problems between Tottenham and Manchester United when he failed to award Spurs a goal in 2005 after Pedro Mendes’ lob clearly crossed the line. Five years later, he correctly, if controversially, allowed a goal to stand when Nani tapped the ball in after goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes thought he had a free-kick.

CLEARED OF RACE JIBE, OCT 2012Clattenburg was accused of aiming a racist insult towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi during their 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United. The FA and the Metropolitan Police launched inquiries into the incident, but a month later, dropped the investigation and Clattenburg was cleared. Mikel was later fined £60,000 and banned for three matches for threatening Clattenburg in the aftermath of the game.
