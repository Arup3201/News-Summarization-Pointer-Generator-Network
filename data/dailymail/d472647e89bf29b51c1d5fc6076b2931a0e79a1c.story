An NBC executive producer has jumped into the controversy surrounding the firing of former Today show co-anchor Ann Curry, saying that it was him - and not Matt Lauer - who made the decision to cut her loose.

Jim Bell has been with NBC since 1990, but in 2005 became the executive producer of Today, which has been marred in recent weeks by diving ratings following Curry’s departure in June.

Reports hinted that Curry’s firing was orchestrated by Lauer as part of a deal to extend his contract, claims that Bell calls 'absolutely not true.'

Bell told The New York Times' Media Decoder blog: 'It was definitely not Matt’s call. He is the host and does not have management responsibility. It was not his call. That was my call.'

Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival Good Morning America has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks.

Early data shows that the ABC morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well.

Additionally, in the 10 weeks before Curry left, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since she left there were just 4.6 million.

Trouble at Today? NBC is reportedly examining whether Matt Lauer, left, is worth what he's being paid after the show took a major hit in rating following the tearful departure of Ann Curry, right

The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed

As Today’s ratings decline in the wake
of Curry’s departure, reports have swirled that Lauer has morphed into 
something of a monster on the set.

Sources told the New York Post’s Page 
Six last week that Lauer is now 'running the show and he’s not listening
to anyone,' causing a 'huge problem.'

Birthdate: July 20, 1967

Hometown: Branford, Connecticut

Education: B.A. in government, Harvard. Played football as a defensive linebacker

Marital status: Married with four sons

Work history: Joined NBC out of college in 1990 to profile athletes for 1992 Barcelona Olympics; became coordinating producer and programming supervisor for NBC Olympics; producer for NBC broadcasts of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA; joined Today in 2005 as executive producer; won Emmys for his work on 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002 Olympics

Responding to the report, Bell told 
The Times: 'Matt is the heart and soul of the broadcast. He has a heart 
of gold. This stuff about him has been very irresponsible and in a lot 
of cases flat-out wrong.'

Bell spoke out amid rumours that NBC is examining whether Lauer is worth his $25million salary as Today ratings tank.

A source close to the situation told Radar Online: 'Matt Lauer will be asked to take a significant cut in his $25million salary if TODAY doesn't win the key November sweeps.'

'The May and November sweeps dictate 
how much the networks can charge for advertising and they are extremely 
important to the bottom line. The TODAY show had always been a cash cow 
for NBC, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.'

Radar reported that NBC Universal is 
now looking at the budgets of the network’s shows, and seeing where cuts
can be made, and in the news division, a significant portion pays 
Lauer's salary.

Bell told The Times that those reports 'could not be more wrong.'

Bell made headlines in August after he
was revealed to be the executive producer behind a series of faux pas 
surrounding NBC’s broadcast of the Olympics.

Among them were delaying the men’s 100 more than six hours so that it could be aired during prime time.

During the Opening Ceremony, the 
network cut a tribute to the victims of the 2005 London terrorist 
bombings, which claimed the lives of 52 people, including one New 
Yorker.

Despite the global impact of the 
tragedy, NBC cut the dance routine and tribute, claiming it wasn't 
tailored for an American audience.
