Federico Fazio believes Tottenham have the players at their disposal to challenge for the title - but only if they can operate as a unit.

The 27-year-old Argentina international moved to White Hart Lane in the summer but, like many new faces at Spurs over the last 18 months, he has struggled to make an impact.

Having already picked up two red cards in just nine first-team outings, Fazio is yet to show the type of form which saw him at the heart of the Sevilla team that won the Europa League last season.

Mauricio Pochettino's tenure at Tottenham has not started well, with the former Southampton boss seeing his side lose four of their six Barclays Premier League home games so far this campaign.

Despite their stuttering start, as well as the uncertainty over the future of the ownership, new stadium and chairman Daniel Levy, Fazio feels the sheer talent can shine through.

The defender disagreed with Emmanuel Adebayor that the club's supporters had to stop showing their dissatisfaction and has instead urged the players to gel together and turn their form around.

'I think at Tottenham we have very good players who can fight for first position in the Premier League,' he said.

'We can fight for the Champions League and the Europa League. But we need to improve like a team, to be like a team because I think we have got very good players.

'I think this (fan's jeering the players) is not the problem. We need to play like a team on the pitch. I think that we have very good players, good enough to be higher in the Premier League.

'There have only been 10 or 11 matches. We need to improve some things but I think we will stay in the top positions of the Premier League.'

Fazio played in Argentina's 2-1 win over Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday evening, operating alongside Sunderland's Santiago Vergini in the centre of Gerardo Martino's defence.

A deflected Cristian Ansaldi strike and a Lionel Messi penalty saw Argentina come from behind to win their friendly, with a trip to face Portugal at Old Trafford next up for Martino's side.

Fazio enjoyed his outing and is keen to keep club woes out of his mind as he looks to add to his three senior caps at the home of Manchester United on Tuesday.

'I was happy to give a good performance in this friendly match,' he added.

'The most important thing was to win for Argentina. We need to win all of our matches and I am very happy for this.

'I'm with the national team and so I only think about Argentina. About the national team. We did very well in this match and I am very happy for this.'Â
