He is known for handing out giftwrapped presents to team-mates.

So it came as no surprise that Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata repeated the trick when he delivered dozens of toys to a primary school in one of the city's toughest areas.

The Spain international, 26, teamed up with a pal who owns a toy brand to dish out gifts to youngsters at the school and across Greater Manchester.

The children were all too happy to take advantage of Mata's visit and collect a late Christmas present

Mata's manager, Louis van Gaal, may also have been happy to see him following in his footsteps when he took a PE lesson.

United's Dutch supremo was a PE teacher back in his homeland and will have been impressed by Mata's masterly skills when he put the four to six-year-olds through their paces at Wythenshawe's Button Lane Primary.

In total Mata and his friend have donated 500 toys which will the club's charity arm, the Manchester United Foundation, will distribute to 49 schools.

He explained: 'I have a good friend who owns a toy brand and we thought it would be nice to work together for the kids here in Manchester and in my hometown of Oviedo, to give these gifts to school children, but also for kids who are in hospital and kids who may not have had gifts from their parents this Christmas.'

Mata, who missed three decent chances in United's 1-0 home defeat to Southampton on Sunday, soon had a smile back on his face.

The deputy head at the school said Mata's visit was a pleasant surprise for the pupils

'It’s been a very nice experience for me to come here today.' he said. 'The kids seem really happy with the gifts and I want to try and do this as much as I can, not only me but the other players as it can be easy for us to do something like this.'

Tracey Palmer, deputy head at the school, revealed that the visit stunned her unknowing pupils.

'In assembly I explained someone famous was coming into school and the children have been intrigued all day.

'The fact that Juan has given up his own time to come along is wonderful. He’s a great inspiration and this visit will be life changing for some of these children as they never get to meet anybody famous and probably never will again.'

Following United's defeat to Southampton, Mata vowed that the team will hit back during the season

Mata was praised by the teachers for giving up his spare time to visit the children at the school

Following the loss to Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints, former Chelsea Mata vowed to come back stronger on his blog.

'We are disappointed because of the defeat,' he wrote, 'but you can rest assured that the team will keep fighting in every game until the end to achieve our goals'.
