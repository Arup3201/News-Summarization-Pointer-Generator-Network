A top private school ignored complaints that a paedophile teacher wanted to ‘spend time alone with boys’ while he was secretly drugging and abusing pupils, a report has ruled.

William James Vahey is said to have abused 60 boys after a series of failings by Southbank International School, which failed to carry out checks on him, an independent inquiry has concluded.

Police believe the globe-trotting predator, who was a leading figure in the international schools community with an ‘immaculate record’, abused hundreds of victims over four decades spent teaching in nine different countries.

He committed suicide earlier this year as the authorities closed in. He preyed on boys aged 12 to 14 at the elite international school, plying them with sleeping pills before carrying out his sickening attacks during school trips abroad.

The married American was found dead in a motel in Luverne, Minnesota, on March 21 just days after confessing to abusing boys.

His death came as the FBI was poised to probe a USB memory stick containing graphic images of 90 children in schools around the world who appeared to be asleep or unconscious while they were assaulted by Vahey.

A review into his criminal conduct by barrister Hugh Davies QC has criticised the £25,000-a-year London school – favoured by diplomats and international executives for their children – for failing to properly handle concerns raised about the 64-year old.

A review seen by the Guardian newspaper said the school breached statutory guidelines when they hired Vahey in 2009, failing to take references before offering him the job and allowing him to be hired after an interview with only the then headmaster, Terry Hedger.

The sex offender had a 1969 conviction for child molestation in California, which various criminal record checks at Southbank failed to uncover as he was not on any sex offenders’ register.

The interim findings of the review, commissioned by Southbank, reveal that concerns about the humanities teacher’s ‘unusual/questionable conduct’ were known about.

A school source said fears were raised about Vahey’s conduct on school trips in his first year.

‘Complaints were made about him wanting to spend time alone with boys,’ the source said. ‘He would say he would stay behind with the boys and the lead teacher would say that was against guidelines. [The teachers] made complaints to the management.’

Mr Davies concluded: ‘Had what was reported within the school about Vahey’s conduct been appropriately recorded and evaluated, the pattern of conduct recorded would have required direct intervention by the school.

‘As a minimum, reviewing his role on school trips and almost certainly further independent investigation under the direction and control of the local authority designated officer.’

Chairman of the school board, Sir Chris Woodhead, who is the former chief inspector of schools, said better recording of complaints should have been in place, but he did not accept it would have led to Vahey being stopped.

He said: ‘There would have been some intervention but what that would have been is speculation.’
