More than 110 Britons evacuated from Libya because of recent deterioration in the military conflict have arrived in Malta on board the HMS Enterprise.

The group including 30 children and four pregnant women entered the Grand Harbour in the Mediterranean island's capital, Valletta, this morning following their journey from Tripoli.

The staff were transported from the British embassy which has been shut down as a result of the worsening security situation in the North African country.

Fighting in Tripoli and the eastern city of Benghazi is the worst since the 2011 civil war that ended four decades of Muammar Gaddafi's rule, increasing international worries Libya is becoming a failed state.

Three years after the war, Libya's fragile government and nascent army are unable to control heavily armed brigades of ex-rebels who refuse to disband and have allied themselves with competing political factions to become powerbrokers.

HMS
 Enterprise's commanding officer, Cdr Mark Vartan, said: 'This is a 
period of uncertainty for UK citizens based in Libya but we have been 
proud to play our part in enabling their move to safety.

'My
 ship's company have adapted to the challenge superbly, making as much 
space as possible and providing essential food, shelter and security for
 the journey.'

Defence
 Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'I thank the crew of HMS Enterprise for 
their support and professionalism in carrying out this important task.'

Between 100 
and 300 Britons are said to remain in Libya. Many of the consular staff 
were evacuated last Monday but the ambassador and core staff remained, 
although they will now also return to the UK.

The precarious situation in Libya was laid bare last week when a British Embassy convoy in Libya came under fire.

Embassy
 staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred on Sunday 
between Tripoli and Zawiya, a city in northwestern Libya.

Michael Aron, the UK's ambassador to Libya, wrote on Twitter: 'There was an attempted carjacking on a British Embassy convoy this morning. Shots were fired at our vehicles but all staff safe.'

The evacuation comes as 22 people died in a day of militia fighting for control of the international airport in the capital, a spokesman for Libya's interim government said.

In a statement early today, it said 'heavily armed groups' have shelled 'civilian targets' endangering thousands of citizens and leaving hundreds of families displaced.

 Crisis in Libya yesterday

A fighter from Zintan brigade watches as smoke rises after rockets fired by one of Libya's militias struck and ignited a fuel tank in Tripoli yesterday. 22 people have died in a single day of fighting 

Flames from the fuel depot light the night sky. In the last few days, sporadic fighting between rival militias has spread northwards in capital Tripoli, including into the area where the British embassy is situated

Islamist militias from the coastal city of Misrata led the assault on airport, seeking to seize it from militias from the mountain town of Zintan.

The 22 people were killed yesterday alone, the latest casualties in fighting that has claimed more than 200 lives in recent weeks.

Since the overthrow in 2011 of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi by rebels supported by British and French air strikes, the north African country has descended into a state of lawlessness as rival militias struggle for power and wealth.

In the last few days, sporadic fighting between rival militias has spread northwards in Tripoli, including into the area where the British embassy is situated.

The violence across Libya has prompted the closure of several foreign missions and the withdrawal of diplomats. On Saturday a Greek naval frigate evacuated embassy staff and nearly 200 people from Greece, China and other countries. 

Tourists have been advised against all travel to the country and the Foreign Office said an assisted departure was being prepared.

Any Britons unable to take advantage of this opportunity to leave have been told they should find their way home on commercial flights, with limited departures from Misrata and Maitega airports.

HMS Enterprise was launched at Appledore in Devon in 2002 and is designed to carry out a wide range of survey work, including support to submarine and amphibious operations.

Since her first operational overseas deployment to the Mediterranean in late 2004, Enterprise has worked in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin, through West Africa to the Republic of South Africa, and off Iraq.

She is the second Royal Navy ship to use azimuth thrusters, where the propellers are part of a swivelling pod, allowing for precise manoeuvring. 

On Wednesday, British Airways suspended flights to and from Tripoli up to and including Tuesday due to the security situation at the country's main international airport.

An FCO spokesman added: 'Fighting has intensified in Tripoli, including around the British Embassy compounds.

'In the light of the deteriorating security situation, we are taking steps temporarily to suspend operations at the British Embassy in Tripoli after the planned assisted departure of British nationals.

'The UK Government has changed its travel advice to reflect the ongoing security situation.

'We advise against all travel to Libya and urge British nationals in Libya to leave through commercially available means.

'The British Embassy is arranging an assisted departure for British nationals. Places are limited and requests for travel will be strictly prioritised.

'We plan temporarily to suspend operations at the British Embassy following the assisted departure. We will not be able to offer consular assistance after August 4.'

On September 11 2012 U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans - information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the U.S. Mission in the Libyan city, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated.
