These are the chilling images of an abandoned amusement park that shut down after a boy lost his ARM on a ride.

Dadipark amusement park, Dadizele, Belgium, closed its doors more than 10-years ago after a young boy had his arm ripped off on the Nautic Jet water ride.

Kris Van de Sande, 28, captured the eerie pictures of the abandoned rides at the fairground where they were left to rust and covered in graffiti.

Uneasy: The fact that many of the 'attractions' remain only add to the chilling atmosphere

The freelance photographer, from Hasselt, Belgium, said the whole park had been 'invaded by nature' after being left untouched since closing 12 years ago.

He said: 'A boy lost his arm on the nautical jet attraction 14 years ago.

'After that people started to complain about safety in the park.

'Visitor numbers dwindled and the park closed in 2002 for major renovations, but never reopened.

'Several groups started to try and re-open the park, but their attempts weren't fruitful.

'There were a lot of plants around because nature had been left to take over. Nature started to reclaim the park, with all of the attractions still intact, but in disrepair.

'Graffiti artists also claimed some of the walls - one hall was used as an impromptu skate-park.'

Kris said the amusement park had deteriorated so drastically since being shut down it had to be demolished completely.

He said: 'Up until a couple of years ago, everything was still there - but at this moment, everything has been levelled.

'Weirdly enough, there were still a few people there when I took a look around.

'While it sometimes is completely locked down, the gates were wide open when I arrived.

'A few locals were walking their dog in the park and other urban explorers were wandering around.

'I've been in several abandoned places during my lifetime. I've also been to theme parks such as Disneyland when only a few hundred guests have been present.

'It's only then that you can truly appreciate the beauty of the minds behind these amusement parks - trying to tell a story.'

Fancy this? A chilling welcome awaits any visitors today to the Dadipark

Not a pretty picture: All that remains of the amusement park is derelict buildings and memories
