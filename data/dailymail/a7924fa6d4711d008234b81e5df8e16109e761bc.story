The fat lady hasn't started to sing yet. She’s barely warming up.

And Jose Mourinho knows football can be a cruel mistress. Arsene Wenger discovered that this time last year when Arsenal were top of the Barclays Premier League by four points and, eventually, they self destructed.

Chelsea find themselves in similar surroundings. They are six points clear of Manchester City and the seventh club in Premier League history to go unbeaten in their opening 14 games. Of the others, three went on to become champions, the rest failed.

It’s a good start but that’s about all it is, despite Mourinho’s mantra proving a hit once more. The Chelsea manager has a history of producing his best work not in the first year, but the second.

At Porto and Inter Milan, Mourinho won the Champions League in his second season. At Real Madrid, the Portuguese manager beat Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering Barcelona to the La Liga title.

At Chelsea, he is projected to break their own Premier League record of 95 points, perhaps scoring more than a century.

They currently have 36 points with a hypothetical 72 to play for in this, Mourinho’s second season at Stamford Bridge following a third-place finish behind Liverpool and Manchester City respectively last year.

It can be no coincidence. Mourinho, too, acknowledges having a year to settle in, to make his mark, to get his squad playing the way he feels best.

‘I think the second season is a privileged place to have the team in very good conditions,’ he said in September 2014. ‘There are teams and managers who work 10 or 15 years with the same team, and step by step with conditions to improve all the time.

‘But I think the second season is a good space for evolution, for improvement and for the team to be in the right condition.’

Diego Costa (centre) and Cesc Fabregas have arguably been the best signings of the summer

So, what makes them such an unbeatable force this year compared to last? Can it really come down to something as simple as the new blood?

Five players in - Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Didier Drogba, Loic Remy and Filipe Luis - at a cost of £88.3million, almost half of which was paid for by getting rid of David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain. Not to mention the return of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from Atletico Madrid and Nemanja Matic in January, too.

The hype has firmly surrounded Costa. The 26-year-old has single-handedly lifted the curse of Chelsea strikers at Stamford Bridge, bringing 11 goals to the Premier League in 916 minutes, seven of which were scored after his first four games.

Hence the excitement when calculations revealed it took Fernando Torres 43 games to match that same total. Instant approval.

Drogba and Remy, too, have proved suitable back-up, as Mourinho reiterated in an I-told-you-so kind of way after a goal apiece against Tottenham Hotspuron Wednesday night.

Fabregas has been an inspiration and has already racked up 10 assists so far this season

But those behind are the workhorses.

Fabregas has contributed 10 assists this year and, as the record stands at 20 by Thierry Henry, the Chelsea midfielder is well on his way to surpassing the total of his former Arsenal team-mate.

Fabregas, much to the annoyance of Wenger, averages twice as many touches per game than his fellow signings. Again, it can be no coincidence.

If that doesn’t outline the 27-year-old’s tirelessness, then this might: he and midfield partner Matic officially became the first players this season to cover more than 100 miles on the pitch.

All this is not to say there aren't times when Chelsea can come unstuck and they have to rely on a smidgen of fortune.

Take, for example, their 0-0 stalemate against Sunderland. Gus Poyet’s blueprint to halt the Mourinho train worked to perfection, namely because he starved Chelsea’s midfield and service to Costa, who was driven to distraction by John O’Shea.

Chelsea are the seventh team in Premier League history to remain unbeaten after the opening 14 games. 

Here's the previous best unbeaten runs, and how the team's fared...  

Arsenal (2003-04) – 38 games, won the league

Man Utd (2010-11) – 24 games, won the league

Arsenal (2007-08) – 15 games, did not win the league

Man City (2012-13) – 15 games, did not win the league

Man City (2011-12) – 14 games, won the league

Liverpool (2007-08) – 14 games, did not win the league 

They came as close a side have to ending Mourinho's record.

'We played to win against a team that defended with nine players. It’s a critique. It’s just to be objective about their strategy. We couldn’t break them,’ Mourinho analysed afterwards.

Fabregas managed 94 per cent completion with 153 passes against West Bromwich Albion previously. At the Stadium of Light, he was down to 88 per cent with just 112 as Sportsmail’s Match Zone shows.

Sunderland shut Chelsea down for 90 minutes and escaped with a hard-earned point. Others are likely to try the same, which may be why Mourinho feels going 38 not out is unthinkable.

Still, Chelsea look a far cry from the team that ‘parked the bus’ under Roberto Di Matteo against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final of 2012. They no longer turn to that strategy, even though the wheels never fell off. They won the final at the Allianz Arena in Munich against Bayern, spoiled the German party, and Di Matteo went his own way.

Chelsea have not had to revert to the spoiling tactics that brought them victory over Barcelona in 2012

Oscar is one of several players who have contributed to Chelsea's 33 league goals this season

But there’s a new approach this year, a more direct one at that by Mourinho.

Chelsea make 53 more passes per game on average these days. They have a better completion rate, are opting for shorter passes, are more clinical in the final third and, to be blunt, know they can score more than the opposition on their day.

The averages just keep rising. Their goals per game has shifted from 1.87 to 2.36, their shot accuracy has gone from 45 per cent to 54, and they are yet to concede a goal through an error.

Despite their impressive record even Mourinho has said that going the whole season unbeaten is 'impossible'

They have 33 goals in 14 matches through Costa, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar and Co, having scored 71 in total last year. Chelsea dominate the game, dictate it to their liking, and Tottenham were the latest to come to terms with that.

Sure, there is a degree of luck. In football there always is.

But Chelsea are a whole different component this year to last, as Mourinho continues to prove why his second time around is far better than the first.
