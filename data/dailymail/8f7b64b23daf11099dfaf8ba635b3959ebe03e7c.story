For motorists driven to distraction by Britain's increasingly cratered roads, German luxury car giant Mercedes-Benz's tonight unveils a clever antidote.

Its new flagship S-Class limousine can see potholes and bumps in the road and adapt suspension to brace itself ahead of the impending impact in a bid to reduce the potential damage and discomfort.

Mercedes-Benz says it is the first car in the world to have suspension 'with eyes' as part of its revolutionary system called 'road surface scan' using a stereo camera.

Flagship: The German luxury car company has unveiled its new S-Class limousine in Hamburg

The firm boasts it is the 'most advanced S-Class ever created', with the driver even able to choose any perfume he or she wishes circulating around the cabin via an atomiser in the air conditioning system.

And it is also the first car in the world to dispense completely with light-bulbs – replacing all lights with LED systems.

As the covers came off the new car in Hamburg, Mercedes-Benz said: 'The new S-Class is the world's first car to detect bumps on the road ahead.

'If the car's road surface scan detects unevenness, it instantaneously sets up the suspension to deal with the situation.

'The 'eyes'; are provided by the camera fitted behind the windscreen, which scans the road up to 15 metres ahead.

More sensors - more protection: The new S-Class is fitted with radar, stereo camera and ultrasonic systems

Dazzle-free: The car's highbeam assist plus detects traffic ahead and adapts the lights accordingly

'The vehicle then adjusts the damping
 of each wheel to a tauter or softer setting in advance or the load in 
the wheel via an active hydraulic system.

'The suspension is adapted within fractions of a second and body movement reduced considerably.'

The firm said the system works in good visibility and at speeds of up to 80 mph. It added that the new S-Class is also 'the first ever car without a single light bulb'.

Instead, nearly 500 high tech 
electronic 'LEDs'  light emitting diodes illuminate the road, the 
vehicle, the interior and the boot.

A
 spokesman said: 'Around 100 years after the introduction of electric 
lighting in motor vehicles, Mercedes-Benz is now making a complete 
switch to LED technology.

Luxury: The S-Class seats include a special massage feature and can recline to 43.5 degrees

'The  new S-Class is the first vehicle in the world that does not contain a single light bulb, outside or inside.'

The intensity of the brake lights is also reduced at night or while waiting at traffic lights to ease the effect on other drivers.

Among the other luxuries are special massage seat features which can even replicate a 'hot stone' massage.

Mercedes-Benz also promise 'to replicate the feeling of a First Class airline cabin by reclining the rear seat to 43.5 degrees.

For executives on the move the car also features a series of mobile office aids, including a multi-media system.

Long awaited: Mercedes-Benz's S400 Hybrid (W222) will be available to order in Britain from next month

Price tag: The S-Class will cost between £65,000 and £100,000 with UK order books opening in June

This is all in a car which Mercedes-Benz points out is lighter, more efficient and faster than the model it replaces.

The firm says the most frugal S300 BlueTec hybrid model will manage 64.2miles to the gallon.

The most powerful S500 model will accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 4.8 seconds with the top speed electronically restricted to 155mph.

The new S-Class will cost between £65,000 and £100,000 with UK order books opening in June ahead of first deliveries in October.
