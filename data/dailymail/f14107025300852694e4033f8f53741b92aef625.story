A disabled puppy dubbed 'the mermaid dog' because her badly bent legs dragged behind her has been taken for a walk for the first time in her life after pioneering surgery.

Daisy, a 14 week-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross Toy Poodle, was born with problems that affected her back legs, earning her the nickname 'the mermaid dog'.

She either walked like a seal with her legs spread behind, or had her legs folded inwards under her body leaving her dragging her feet and shuffling her bum along the floor.

Once nicknamed 'the mermaid dog', Daisy is now able to enjoy running and walking like any other dog. Here she is pictured going for a run after her surgery, for which the back half of her body was shaved

Daisy, who was originally called Tuffty, was taken to a vet to be put down by a dog breeder, but the vet passed her on to an animal shelter.

Her new owners Paul Brothwell, 57, and wife Debbie, 54, fell in love with her after spotting her at Ravenswood Pet Rescue, Cambridgeshire.

The couple spent £2,500 on pioneering surgery for Daisy at the Queen's Veterinary School Animal Hospital in Cambridge.

Surgeons had to use tweezers and small eye surgery tools to delicately fix Daisy's knee joints as she is so small.

She now has a new lease of life and is able to run around with the family's other dogs Harry, a two year-old chihuahua cross Yorkie, and Alfie, a nine year-old Yorkie cross Jack Russell.

Mr Brothwell, who works for Anglian Water, said: 'When we saw her we just fell in love with her.

'She dragged along her legs a bit like a seal. Her knee caps weren't in the right place and her hips were funny and we just felt so bad for her.

'She wasn't in pain but she was very uncomfortable and she couldn't bear any weight on her right leg.'

But since her pioneering surgery - carried out with tweezers and eye surgery tools - she has been able to run and play like any other dog. Here she is pictured on the right in the arms of her owner Debbie Brothwell

Mr Brothwell added: 'She used to drag her bum across the floor and that would also be uncomfortable.

'We were absolutely thrilled to know she could be helped and though the surgery cost a lot it was worth it.

'We were told the day after the operation she just stood up, it was incredible.

'My wife Debbie used to take Daisy out in her coat while the other dogs were walked, but now she can join in.

'Now she charges around the house like a mad thing. She can play with Alfie and Harry and though her legs still go slightly to the left they are more or less straight.'

Mrs Brothwell, a carer, said: 'Her legs were like jelly, she just dragged them round in the position she got up in.

'It's amazing to see her be able to walk. We were told by one vet to think about putting her to sleep but we just couldn't, and Daisy proved them wrong.'

Daisy was already fixed at the rescue centre with splints which helped her build up the ability to walk.

But the centre never thought a family would be kind enough to not only take on Daisy, but fork out the cost for surgery too.

Her legs still veer slightly to the left (as pictured on the right), but her condition is now significantly improved from when they were 'like jelly', owner Paul Brothwell said

The Brothwells were told the surgery - which carried a 50 per cent success rate - would cost a whopping £10,000, but orthopaedic surgeon Gareth Arthurs found a way of doing it for a quarter of the price.

The delicate surgery, which involved filing a groove in her bones to help reset her legs and get her knee caps to sit properly, was the first time it had been carried out at the practice.

Paul, who is dad to Sarah, 33, Sophie, 30, and Lucy, 23, said the pup was already walking on all fours when she was ready to return to their home in Orwell, Cambridgeshire.

Sophie, a school teacher, said: 'A call to adopt her was put on Facebook and that's how we first found out about her. We called her the mermaid puppy.

'She still needs some physio. We're doing hydrotherapy with her, which makes her fur come out all fluffy - it's adorable.

'She may need hip surgery later, but for now she loves running about and we're so happy to have her this Christmas.'

The family are planning to fundraise for Daisy's future hip surgery and are getting in touch with Paul O'Grady to see if he can help.
