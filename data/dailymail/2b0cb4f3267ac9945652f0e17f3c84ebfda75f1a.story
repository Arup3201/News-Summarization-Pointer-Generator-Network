Victim: Jon-Jo Highton, 18, suffered horrific injuries after one of his attackers shouted ‘That’s him!’ and he was set upon by a gang, a jury was told

A teenager was hacked to death in the street near his home by eight men who jumped out of two cars and launched a brutal revenge attack, a court heard yesterday.

Jon-Jo Highton, 18, suffered horrific injuries after one of his attackers shouted ‘That’s him!’ before the group began slashing at him, a jury was told.

His mother fled the court in tears as the jury was shown a computerised image showing the horrific injury to the side of the head which the prosecution say was the fatal blow.

The shocking attack in a street in Preston, Lancashire stemmed from rivalry between groups of drug-dealers but had been provoked by a violent incident hours earlier at the home of one of the alleged killers, the court heard.

Member of the group which set upon the father-of-one had earlier been storing axes, knives, hammers and a sword, telling people they were ‘in case the enemy rolls on us’, the jury was told.

‘We are not able to say which of the defendants struck the fatal blow, but what we do say is that each of the defendants charged on count one is guilty of the offence of murder because he participated in the attack on Jon-Jo Highton and he did so with murderous intent,’ Neil Flewitt, QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Preston Crown Court.

He said Jon-Jo had been killed by being struck on the side of the face by a long-bladed weapon ‘with considerable force’, severing his jugular vein and carotid artery, but suffered numerous other wounds as well.

He said the jury would hear the attack had been launched in revenge for an incident in the early hours of that morning, August 23 last year, at 19-year-old Owen Whitesmith’s home in which a friend of his mother was headbutted.

Mr Flewitt said the jury would hear that Whitesmith had been storing weapons including a sword in the flat of a girl he had been dealing heroin only for them to be moved a week before the killing.

He said Jon-Jo's group and Whitesmith's associates were rival drug dealers and that there was 'a background of hostility' between them.

In the day following the headbutt attack, ‎another witness told police Whitesmith had been ‎'trying to get some lads together in revenge', Mr Flewitt said.

The jury was told Whitesmith referred to friends as 'G' in texts, meaning 'gangster', Mr Flewitt said.

Among those they recruited was 23-year-old Arran Graham, known as 'Scottish'.

In one text, the jury was told Whitesmith asked him: '‎Are you going to come and do something with me today because all the boys are pussies?'

Graham allegedly replied: 'Come and get me bro.'

Mr Flewitt said Graham later sent Whitesmith a text message asking 'What soldiers have we got?' to which he answered 'L's bro and big weapons'.

Flanked by security guards in the glass-panelled dock, Graham appeared to smirk and exchanged glances to a smiling co-defendant ‎as the prosecution case against them was outlined.

Another was Craig Walton, 26, who according to visitors to his flat had a large machete-type weapon and a stick with a spike taped to one end to defend his drugs if someone tried to steal them, Mr Flewitt said.

Mr Flewitt said the quartet, joined by 24-year-old Stephen Walton (no relation) drove towards Jon-Jo's home in the Deepdale area in Whitesmith’s blue Vauxhall Vectra at about 10.30pm that day, keeping in touch with three further men in a second car, a Vauxhall Meriva.

At about 11.15pm, he said, the jury would hear that 20-year-old drug dealer Zaahid Patel, who was in the second car, spotted Jon-Jo - who had just left a pub near his home where he was playing pool - and shouted 'That's him!' and called Whitesmith‎.

'It is the prosecution case that the purpose of the call was for Zaahid Patel to let Owen Whitesmith know that he had spotted Jon-Jo Highton,' he added.

Moments later, Jon-Jo was attacked with fatal consequences.

Whitesmith, Graham, Patel, Craig Walton, Minhaj Musa, 21, Mohammed Sabaar Dal, 20, all of Preston, Joshua Bore, 19, of Ribbleton, and Stephen Walton, of no fixed address, all deny murder.

Liam Tunstall, 26, of Penwortham, Stuart Eastham, 32, of Ribbleton, and John Wilding, 36, of Darwen, all deny assisting an offender.

The trial continues.
