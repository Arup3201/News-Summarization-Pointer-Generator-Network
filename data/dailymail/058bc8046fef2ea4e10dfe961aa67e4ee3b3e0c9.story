Fans of HBO's Game Of Thrones can now relax and enjoy the hit TV series with a new beer brewed in its honour.

Ommegang brewery - based in Cooperstown, New York - is hoping to cash in on the medieval fantasy show's popularity by releasing the Game Of Thrones 'Iron Throne Blonde Ale.'

focus 'on developing truly unique beers that directly tie into themes, 
characters and nuances of the series of the medieval-like fantasy realm 
of Westeros and surrounding kingdoms,' the Chicago Tribune reports.

Iron
Throne Blonde Ale is available on draft and in 750ml bottles.

Another three types of Game of Thrones beer are planned to coincide with the different seasons of the medieval fantasy series.

Founded by Don Feinberg and Wendy Littlefield, Ommegang began brewing Belgian-style ales in 1997. The brewery was set up in a purpose-built building based on the design of a traditional Belgian farmhouse.

Game of Thrones is based on George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels. It is filmed in a Belfast studio and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia, Iceland, and Morocco.
