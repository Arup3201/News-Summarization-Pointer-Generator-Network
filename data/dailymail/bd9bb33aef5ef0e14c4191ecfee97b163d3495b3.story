When working in the service industry, returning customers are king, and with all the extras that come with this bike-taxi ride, he should have them queuing up in no-time.

G Annadurai has upgraded his rickshaw with amenities a passenger in a London black cab could only dream of, including magazines, a mobile phone charger and a tablet.

Annadurai, from Chennai in South India, also offers free rides for teachers and hospital workers and spends his profits on education for impoverished street children.

 Annadurai has become famous across Chennai thanks to his unique three-wheeler, which boasts a wide selection of newspapers and magazines as well as wi-fi and a TV for his passengers.

The 28-year-old believes in putting the customer first, offering free rides to the deserving and even running regular prize draws for his returning passengers.

Annadurai, 28, said: ‘Customer satisfaction is the most important thing in my work. Customer is God. I try to keep my rickshaw well decked up.’

The humble taxi driver even offers free rides on Mother’s Day, Valentine's Day and his own birthday.

He added: ‘All customers will also get a chocolate on all these days.’

It took Annadurai years to save up and afford many of the luxury items he offers his passengers.

‘The rickshaw has a wide range of magazines and newspapers for the passengers. I also offer mobile phone and satellite TV service recharge,’ he said.

‘I have Wi-Fi, but not all passengers have a device, so I offer them a tablet.’

Annadurai also issues lucky coupons to passengers, and come end of month, he has a prize draw.

The winners get free rides throughout the following month, and sometimes a cash reward too.

For a good cause: This year, he is sponsoring three street children's education, but hopes to increase the number to ten by next year

The good samaritan also provides his 
services free of charge to teachers and hospital workers, and spends 
most of his earnings on educating poor kids throughout Chennai.

Last
 year he sponsored the education of three street kids and later this 
year he intends to sponsor 10 more from a local government school.

‘I also want to provide a place where the elderly don't feel they are a burden, an old age home maybe,’ he said.

‘There they can be taught simple skills which they can use to earn a little money and spend it the way they want to.’
