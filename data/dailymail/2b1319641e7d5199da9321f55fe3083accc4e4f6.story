A Chinese man has accidentally set his wife on fire in the middle of a crowded restaurant, after becoming impatient with how fast his tea was brewing.

Tang Kung set his wife ablaze after he poured alcohol over an open flame at his table in the restaurant in Guangzhou, a city in China's Guangdong Province, the People's Daily Online reported.

He had  become impatient with the speed with which his tea was boiling, so decided to give in a helping hand. 

Explosion: The moment the fireball shot across the restaurant table was caught on camera

Help: Tang Kung is then shown desperately trying to put the flames out, which had engulfed his wife

Mr Tang said he had only wanted to make the flame a bit larger after noticing the burner was starting to run low on fuel.

But as soon as he poured the alcohol on the flame - which was lit in the middle of the table - a massive fireball shot out, engulfing his wife Lu Mai, 43. 

Video footage shows the injured woman - whose clothes had caught fire - leaping up as her 53-year-old husband tried to extinguish the flames with his hands.

Mr Tang told reporters later: 'The fire was extremely fierce. All the service attendants fled in terror when it happened.

'It was very difficult to put out.' 

In the end, Mr Tang was helped by other customers and restaurant staff, who extinguished the fire with the help of table cloths.

Injured: Shocked restaurant customers then rushed to the burned woman's assistance

Mrs Lu was rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for second degree burns to her face, neck and left arm. 

Cooking items at your own table in a restaurant has become a trend in China, but it is not without its risks. 

Last September, a similar tragedy took place when a waitress at a barbecue restaurant in the city of Zhejiang poured liquid alcohol over the grill, causing it to burst into flames and setting a customer on fire. 

A spokesman for Xia Hsing, the restaurant where the most recent accident happened, said: 'Customers are not allowed to refuel the stoves but the man had ignored the rule and taken the matter into his own hands, saying he didn't want to disturb the waitress.'
