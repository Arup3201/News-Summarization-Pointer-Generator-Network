Prince Charles said he was 'enormously proud and happy' at becoming a grandfather for the first time as he went ahead with a scheduled visit to York.

The Prince did not want the impending birth of his first grandchild to interfere with his royal duties, but he couldn't hide his delight after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a baby boy.

He said: 'Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild. 

Prince Charles leaving Harewood House, West Yorkshire. When asked by the press of any news on the baby he replied 'No, no, no. You'll hear before I do,' but perhaps there was a special reason he was smiling

'It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy.  

'Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyone’s life, as countless kind people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing the baby in the near future.'

India, from York, said: 'He said hello and who's this, and I said this is Henry and he is excited for your imminent arrival. 

'And he said "oh yes, we are excited".'

Charles then continued with his official duties but his joy was plain to see as he smiled and joked with the crowd.

The smile that says it all: Prince Charles couldn't hide his joy at the birth of his first grandchild in York today - smiling and joking with members of the crowd

Later in the evening as Prince Charles left a function at Harewood House, near Leeds, was asked if there was any news from the hospital.

He laughed as he replied: ‘No. You'll hear before I do, I suspect.’

He was asked by a number of guests at the function whether he had heard anything from the hospital and he said he had not.

His comments come as the Queen returned to London after spending the night at Windsor Castle, travelling by car to Buckingham Palace.

Return: The Queen arrived at Buckingham Palace this afternoon after leaving Windsor Castle, in time for her great-grandson's birth at 4.24pm

New child: But it is not yet known when the Queen will meet her new grandson for the first time

Return: The Queen was in London when the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth

Great-grandmother: The Queen left Windsor Castle this afternoon on her way back to Buckingham Palace

But while the Queen decided to return to London, Charles remained more than 200 miles away in the North of England, showing 
that not even the most exciting family drama can stop him carrying out 
his Royal duties.

He arrived at the National Railway Museum in York by steam train as he began a two-day visit to Yorkshire.

The Prince stepped off the Royal Carriage through clouds of steam, to applause and cheers from the crowd.

The
carriage was pulled into the museum by Bittern, the sister engine of 
Mallard, which marked 75 years as the world's fastest steam train 
earlier this month. 

Visit: While his daughter-in-law went into labour, Prince Charles tried out a steam train at the National Railway Museum in York

Out and about: Prince Charles greeted crowds in York as he continued his official visit despite the impending birth of his first grandchild

Dedicated: The Prince was not distracted from his Royal duties by the news the Duchess of Cambridge had gone into labour

Tribute: The Prince of Wales was visiting the centre to mark the success of the Mallard Locomotive

As he alighted, he spoke to well-wishers who had turned out to welcome him.

Alex Dickinson and her sons, Thomas, seven, and Freddie, five, 
travelled from nearby Church Fenton to catch a glimpse of Charles.

She wished the Prince well with the birth of his grandchild as her children gave him a picture of a giraffe for the baby.

She said her son Freddie had said the royal baby was coming in six hours, to which Charles replied: 'Yes, it may well be.'

Asked by another bystander whether 
there was any news from the hospital, the Prince replied: 'Absolutely 
nothing at the moment - we're waiting.'

Gift: The Prince was handed a teddy by members of the crowd outside the museum

On his visit Charles blew the whistle 
of the Doncaster-built Mallard, which broke the world record for steam 
when it reached 126mph on the East Coast Main Line in July 1938. It is 
now a permanent exhibit at the museum.

He met retired Mallard driver Bernard 
Bell, 89, who once transported the Queen on a royal visit when he was 
working as a fireman on another locomotive.

Mr Bell, from York, who drove Mallard,
Bittern and similar engines for decades, said: 'He was very interested 
in the locomotives and he asked me all sorts of questions about my 
driving. It's the first time I've met him and he seemed very nice.'

Charles also looked round the museum's
collection of royal carriages, including Queen Victoria's favourite 
carriage, King Edward's saloon and Queen Elizabeth's saloon, used by the
Royal Family during the Second World War.

The visit was the first event of the 
tour of Yorkshire by the Prince, who will be joined by the Duchess of 
Cornwall tomorrow when he will visit rural communities before ending up 
in the seaside town of Bridlington.

Record: The Prince is the patron of celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the day the Mallard broke the world speed record when it reached 126mph on the East Coast Main Line in July 1938

Tour: The Prince of Wales was shown the Doncaster-built Mallard and the museum's collection of royal carriages

Engagements: Charles will visit several sites in central Yorkshire today before finishing with a reception for Prince's Trust supporters at Harewood House, near Leeds

He then moved on to York Minster, where he was greeted by cheering crowds and the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu.

He walked through the magnificent interior of the Gothic cathedral with the Archbishop as tourists stopped to take photographs.

He
was given a private tour of a recently opened state-of-the-art visitor 
attraction, Revealing York Minster, in the Undercroft before moving on 
to the workshops to talk to the craftsmen and apprentices restoring the 
building.

Charles even had a go with a chisel and a hammer as he talked to the stonemasons.

The
Dean of York, the Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, said: 'We're proud and 
excited that he's come today - but especially today because, in the life
of his family, this is going to be such an important day.'

The Dean said she was especially pleased the Prince took such an interest in the apprentices working at the Minster.

Exhibits: The Prince of Wales was shown around the museum's collection of royal carriages

Smiling: The Prince seemed happy and relaxed will looking around the museum's collection of trains

Train fan: Charles was apparently very interested in the vintage locomotives he saw in the museum

As the Prince left the workshops, in glorious sunshine, he was greeted by crowds shouting 'congratulations'.

One York resident, John Dowson, had a joke with the Prince, shouting out 'It's triplets!' as a joke and receiving a generous laugh in return.

During his visit to an abattoir, Charles joked about becoming a grandfather, saying: 'I'm very grateful indeed for the kind wishes for my rather slowly approaching grandfatherhood.'

He added: 'Some of you may realise that with grandfatherhood comes, in four months' time, old-age-pensionerhood.'

The Prince's comments came as he toured Dovecote Park, a food processing plant near Pontefract, where owner Richard Canvin said: 'We'd like to wish you a speedy and safe arrival of your first grandchild.'

Technical director Peter Boyes said that Charles had been keen to discuss issues such as sustainability and animal welfare, especially since he keeps his own cattle.

On duty: Prince Charles, pictured in York today,
and the Queen, pictured last week, are carrying out their schedules as 
normal despite the Duchess of Cambridge going into labour today

Couple: William and Kate drove to the hospital around 6am today to prepare for the birth of their child

Hospital: Kate was in labour in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London

Scrum: The media had gathered outside the hospital awaiting the birth of the future monarch

Charles has rarely commented publicly on the impending birth, but earlier this month he asked a women's group if they had any tips on being a good grandparent during to a trip to Kenfig in Wales.

One 74-year-old grandmother told him, 'Spoil them - enjoy it,' leading him to reminisce about happy memories of his own grandmother, the Queen Mother.

The Queen was kept informed about Kate's condition when she was at Windsor castle, and travelled to Buckingham Palace early in the afternoon.

Prince Harry is at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk, where he is based with his squadron of Apache helicopter pilots, and is said to be very excited about becoming an uncle for the first time.

The Earl of Wessex is currently in Devon.

The whereabouts of the other Royals is 
not known, but it is believed that William is the only relative to have 
joined Kate in hospital today.

Birth: Charles with Princess Diana and their newborn son William outside St Mary's in 1982

Last week, the Queen suggested that she was keen to see the baby - her third great-grandchild - as soon as possible.

During a trip to the Lake District, 10-year-old Fay Batey asked Her Majesty whether she wanted the child to be a boy or a girl.

The Queen replied that she did not mind, but added: I would very much like it to arrive because I'm going on holiday soon... I wish it would hurry up.'

Her Majesty is apparently set to travel to her private Balmoral estate in Scotland for her summer holiday in the next few days.

The Duke of Cambridge, who has temporarily been off duty from his role as an RAF rescue pilot, will take two weeks of paternity leave after the birth.
