A cabin perched on a creek - that has just 240 square feet - has become the perfect getaway for one Maine couple.

'The best part is getting away from it all. There's no TV, no one to bother you - and no property taxes or permits,' builder Foy Brown, who shares the home with his wife Louisa, told Maine Home Design.

Foy built the Perry Creek residence over ten years, the magazine reported, by creating a base on land before he constructed  'Chateau Bathub' on water. 

The Browns' home 'was pretty crude' when they married four years ago, Foy told the magazine, but over 
time he said he was able to fix the leaky roof.

Foy told the magazine he and his wife kept the home to themselves after ' [...] we realized that if you rent it to someone who gets 
snot-flying drunk you’re screwed no matter how much insurance you have.'

Photos reveal 'Chateau Bathtub''s ground floor features a largely blue-and-white coloring scheme, with a sofa, table and chairs, and small kitchen area.

Despite its cozy size, the cabin which is also referred to as 'The Redneck Yacht Club,' features a small second floor, which includes a bed and a balcony fashioned out of pieces of wood.

Out front, there is a small deck area, with chairs, lamps and potted plants.

The couple use both propane and water tanks to keep the house - which they keep open between May and November -  running smoothly, Maine Home Design reported.

Though the home has its charms, Foy told the magazine 'the outdoor shower ain't that nice when it's cold out.'

'I feel very sad when we have to leave,' Louisa told the magazine. 'It's like closing up a summer house.'

Rest: Upstairs, the home features a small sleeping area for homeowners Foy and Louisa Brown
