Alex Salmond is under pressure to sack one of his top aides after he was accused of 'smearing' the mother of a disabled child who spoke out against breaking-up the UK.

Campbell Gunn, the First Minister's senior special adviser and political spokesman, has apologised 'unreservedly' to Clare Lally, who spoke at a Better Together rally this week.

But a tearful Miss Lally yesterday refused to accept the apology and said it was an 'insult'. Opposition  accuse the SNP Scottish Government of being involved in a co-ordinated attack on Unionists.

Clare Lally told hundreds of campaigners in Glasgow she was 'just an ordinary mum from Clydebank campaigning for Scotland to stay in the UK'

At the rally, Miss Lally told hundreds of campaigners in Glasgow she was 'just an ordinary mum from Clydebank campaigning for Scotland to stay in the UK'. 

She told how she was grateful for the care health workers had given her seven-year-old twin girls, one of whom has cerebral palsy, and said she wanted to 'make sure our NHS remains the best in the world'.

She was subsequently subjected to vile online abuse from so-called 'cybernats' who labelled her a 'liar' and a 'quisling' and accused her of exploiting her own disabled child for political purposes.

One blogger suggested that Better Together was 'misleading people by presenting hardcore political activists as normal everyday folk' because Miss Lally failed to mention that she had been appointed to Labour's shadow cabinet as a carers' champion.

The Wings Over Scotland website also questioned if she was 'Claire Lally', the daughter-in-law of former Labour Lord Provost of Glasgow Pat Lally. However, Miss Lally is not related to Mr Lally, and the blogger behind the site, Stuart Campbell, later edited the entry.

But his original post, published around 10am yesterday, was followed by an email from Mr Gunn to the Daily Telegraph's Scottish political editor Simon Johnson at 10.53am.

The correspondence, sent from Mr Gunn's Scottish Government address, stated: 'You are no doubt aware that the "mother-of-two" who described herself as "just a normal person" in the Telegraph today is actually a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet and daughter-in-law of former Labour Lord Provost of Glasgow Pat Lally...'

Last night Mr Gunn, a former political editor with the Sunday Post newspaper, said any suggestion of a co-ordinated attack was 'completely untrue'. But Miss Lally said: 'In the past 48 hours it's just been absolute hell, and that's because of him.

'I think I am only receiving the apology from him because he has been caught out. The email and inaccurate information has been shown for what it is. It is an attack on myself as a mum, as a person and as a parent. I won't be accepting this apology.'

Miss Lally has campaigned for carers and children with disabilities since one of her twin girls, Katie, was born with cerebral palsy. Now seven, she has a number chronic and complex health conditions which means she requires 24-hour care.

Miss Lally lives in Clydebank with her fiancé Derek Steel and Katie's twin, Holly.

Yesterday Miss Lally, who was forced to give up her full-time job as a secretary, told the Scottish Daily Mail that she did not want to become a 'pawn' in the political debate.

Speaking from her home, she said: 'I have been accused of using politics, but they have used my children.

'My battle is not the independence referendum. My battle is trying to get through this. I just want to make my children proud of me.'

Both Labour and the Tories accused Mr Gunn of a 'smear'. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'Apologies are not enough. Alex Salmond must sack his senior adviser Campbell Gunn.

'Campbell Gunn's attack on Clare Lally unleashed a tidal wave of vile abuse aimed squarely at her on the internet which caused Clare and her family immense distress.

'Once Campbell Gunn is sacked, we can then ask the many further questions this disgusting incident throws up. Did Alex Salmond sanction this attack?

'How far reaching is the First Minister's grip on the Nationalist machine which abuses and traduces his opponents?'

First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Gunn made a 'mistake' but is under pressure over attacks on opponents to independence

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'For such slurs and misinformation to be spread by one of the First Minister's taxpayer-funded key advisers is a new low for the SNP government in this referendum debate.'

But Mr Gunn sought to defend his actions, saying: 'Nothing in the email I sent was intended in any way to be a personal slight on Miss Lally or question her absolute right to express her views. 

'I apologise unreservedly for the upset and offence that has been caused to her and her family. 

'I deplore online abuse directed against Miss Lally or anyone else - from whichever side in the referendum debate - and the assertion by the No camp aign that I had any involvement in the co-ordination of such activity is completely untrue.'

Mr Salmond said: 'Campbell made a mistake and he has been told to apologise.'
