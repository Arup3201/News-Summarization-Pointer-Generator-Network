A 100-year-old British runner has become the oldest person to complete a marathon. 

Fauja Singh finished the  26-mile Toronto Waterfront Marathon in Canada on  Sunday – ahead of five other runners – in eight hours, 25 minutes and 16 seconds.

After 22 miles the centenarian briefly looked like he  might have to stop, but battled on for another two hours to reach the finishing line in 3,850th place.

The feat earns Mr Singh, from Ilford,
East London, another spot in Guinness World Records. He already held a 
world record for the men’s over-90s category after finishing the 2003 
Toronto marathon.

Indian-born Mr Singh,  who moved to the UK in the 1960s, developed a love for running when he was a farmer in Punjab. 

He took up the sport seriously only 11 years ago after the death of his wife. He trains every day, running ten miles. 

Mr Singh, who was a torchbearer at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, now hopes to participate in the 2012 London Games torch relay. 

He attributes his extraordinary 
stamina to ginger curry, cups of tea and ‘being happy’, adding: ‘The 
secret to a long and healthy life is to be stress-free. 

‘Be grateful for everything you have, stay away from  people who are negative, stay smiling and keep running.’
