Jermaine Pennant has become the latest former Premier League star to move to the Indian Super League after signing for FC Pune City.

Pennant, formerly of Arsenal, Liverpool and most recently Stoke City, follows in the footsteps of Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg and Nicolas Anelka by joining the newly-formed league.

Pennant made 11 appearances for Stoke last season before the Potters opted against renewing the 31-year-old’s contract in January.

The 31-year-old made 11 appearances last season - his final competitive outing came on January 1

The winger has been called in as a replacement for Colombian Omar Andres Rodríguez who has been ruled out of the remainder of the IPL campaign with a kidney complaint. 

Pennant, who has been without a club since Stoke released him at the beginning of the year, left the Londoners following a short trial.

Pennant was linked with a move to Napoli this summer which would have meant a reunion with former boss Rafa Benitez, whom he flourished under at Anfield playing in a Champions League final, but that failed to materialise.

Pennant moved to Arsenal when he was just 16, but failed to make a permanent impression on the first team
