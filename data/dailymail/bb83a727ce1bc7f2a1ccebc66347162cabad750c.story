A new smartphone app - nicknamed the iPlod - will allow the public to report crimes directly to the police.

Every year hundreds of thousands of crimes - including burglary, theft and violent attacks - go unreported because victims can’t be bothered with the ‘hassle’ of calling the police.

And last year around half a million calls to the non-emergency 101 number went unanswered because operators were too busy.

Ministers want the police to be more efficient through the use of mobile technology. Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured with a neighbourhood policing team in South West London in 2010, was speaking at yesterday's Superintendents' Conference

The free app, which is named ‘Self Evident’, allows users to report the crime without making the call.

The information - including the location of the crime, when it happened and the victim’s personal details, are then passed on to their local beat bobby or the police headquarters.

The app was the idea of charity Witness Confident, which was set up to help improve relations between the public and the police.

Guy Dehn, the charity’s director, said he hoped the app would improve levels of unreported crime and ensure the police get all the details they need.

He said: ‘The Self Evident app is a state-of-the-art expression of Sir Robert Peel’s principle that ‘the police are the public, the public are the police’.

‘Self Evident makes it easy for the public to report crime, make statements and file evidence with the police simply and securely.

‘Mobile technology is an incredibly powerful tool and this app will put that power in the public’s hands so they can help cut crime in their area.’

The app is available to download on iPhones and Android smartphones.

In London and Northumbria, crime reports filled in on the app will be sent to the police headquarters.

Elsewhere, the data is sent directly to the neighbourhood police team via the police.uk website.

The charity estimates that some 406,000 victims of crime do not report what happened to them because of the inconvenience.

Ministers have said they want the police to be more efficient through the use of mobile technology.

Yesterday Theresa May said officers would be able to use iPhones to get instant access to the Police National Computer - allowing them to remain on the beat while carrying out checks.

In her speech to the Superintendents’ Conference yesterday she also pledged £50million for a new Police Innovation Fund designed to help pay for new inventions.

She said IT was currently the ‘bane of every officer’s life’.

‘IT is central to efficient policing, and we are going to end the situation where a police officer either carries an out-of-date device that cannot link him to essential databases, or none at all.

‘It is soon going to be possible to connect a range of the most popular mobile devices to national policing systems - and without compromising security.

‘This will mean that officers will be able to use an iPhone (for instance) to get on to the PNC to check criminal and other records - which will increase their efficiency very considerably.’
