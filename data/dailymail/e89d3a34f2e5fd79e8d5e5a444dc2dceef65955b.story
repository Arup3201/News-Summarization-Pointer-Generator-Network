Snuggling tenderly on the sofa, Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp could not seem more in love as they share a laugh over their pet monkey - in their final photograph together before he shot her dead.

The photo provides a moving insight into the life of the lovers, who friends claim appeared every inch South Africa's golden couple.

But four days after it was taken, Reeva would be dead and Pistorius in court accused of murder.

'He was tickling her,' Pistorius' best friend Christo Menelaou, who took the picture, told South Africa's You magazine. 'They were lovers and also real friends.'

Christo, 34, who said Pistorius had grown a thick beard since his girlfriend's death, added: 'He cries a lot and says over and over, "I’m sorry".' 

Pistorius denies murder, claiming he shot his model girlfriend by accident because he believed a burglar had entered their home while they slept.

It comes as it was today reported detectives investigating Reeva's death have questioned a blonde socialite over her relationship with the Blade Runner amid claims the two shared flirty text messages and canoodled at a party.

Junior PR executive Erin Stear, 25, gave a statement to police under oath in which she denied having an affair with Pistorius, according to The Sun.

A source told the paper: 'Erin met Oscar when Reeva was his girlfriend. They hit it off and met up again after messaging each other. She was really excited about getting to know him.'

Also today, Pistorius' brother Carl appeared in court 
charged with killing a woman with his 4x4 in a road 
accident in 2008.

Prosecutors say Carl Pistorius was 
driving an SUV in March 2008 when he collided with a female 
motorcyclist. The woman, Marietjie Barnard, died in a hospital.

Although
the culpable homicide charge against Carl was initially dropped, it was
reinstated this year after forensic evidence and reports from the 
accident scene became available, according to prosecutors.

The Pistorius family said last month that Carl deeply regretted the incident, but insisted it was a 'tragic accident.'

He was not under the influence of alcohol, the family said.

It comes days after Oscar Pistorius revealed he will not return to the track for the rest of the year so he can focus on his looming court case.

Pistorius
stands accused of premeditated murder after the death of his girlfriend
Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead on Valentine's Day at his Pretoria 
home.

The 'Blade Runner', 
who was released on bail in February, will be back in court on June 4 
and is likely to stand trial before the end of 2013.

But the Paralympian’s coach Ampie Louw
revealed Pistorius has turned down invitations to take part in major 
international athletic events and will stay away from the track.

Louw said: 'We have decided as a team we are not talking [about] any training or athletics.

'We have postponed [races] for the whole year.'
