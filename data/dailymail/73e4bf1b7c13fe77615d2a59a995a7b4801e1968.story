A man was being quizzed tonight over the nightclub murder of a 17-year-old boy, stabbed to death in a 'silent killing'.

Jordan Malutshi, 17, from London, was stabbed early this morning while partying in the Face Bar in Chatham Street, Reading, Berkshire.

A 31-year-old man handed himself in to police today and was being interviewed by detectives over the killing.

Crime scene: Police seal off the area outside Face Bar in Reading, where Jordan Malutshi, 17, was stabbed

The venue was full of clubbers enjoying an R&B event, where Radio 1 Extra DJ Young Lion played a set.

Revellers
said they did not even realise someone had been stabbed, adding that 
there had been no fracas or fight in the moments before Jordan was 
murdered.

A woman noticed blood on her dress and told bar staff she did not know where it had come from. Jordan was found lying on the floor near the club's toilets shortly afterwards.

Police called to the club at 3.50am tried to revive him at the scene before he was taken to hospital.

But he died from his injuries a short time after being admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, said Thames Valley Police.

A murder inquiry has begun into the killing which has been described as an 'isolated incident' by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Mahon, of the force's major crime unit, said tonight: 'This was an isolated incident in which a young man needlessly lost his life.

'We have a team of detectives working on the case and are committed to carrying out a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to this tragic incident.

'We know there were a large number of people in the Face Bar at the time of the incident and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has information which could assist our ongoing inquiry, to call us.'

Shocking: Jordan was found lying on the floor near the club's toilets. Police tried to revive him but he died in hospital

A post mortem conducted by a Home Office pathologist this afternoon found Jordan died from a haemorrhage caused by a stab wound to the heart.

Clubbers spoke of their shock at the incident, which happened 10 minutes from the scheduled end of the nightclub's 'Love Suh Nice' R&B night.

One reveller, who would not be named, said: 'There was a girl who found blood on her dress. She didn't know where it had come from.

'When they found him collapsed we thought he had just been punched.'

Another clubber said: 'It was about 3.50 and there were a few in from out of town.

'There hadn't been a fight, there didn't seem to be anything going on.

'The guy who had been stabbed even walked to the entrance, near to the men's toilets.

'There wasn't even an argument or a bad word said but it must have been ongoing.

'I don't know what it was to do with. I think they were from London.'

About 150 people are believed to have been in the bar when the attack occurred.

The clubber said: 'These nights have been running for 10 or 15 years and most of the people who go are regulars - everyone loves it and they all have a good time.

'Maybe this group came down because they thought people wouldn't know them.

'Everyone who was there is a bit shaken up and shocked, especially because there has never been anything like that happen - that's the most amazing thing.'

The witness added: 'There has never been any problem at all, no fights or arguments or anything.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
