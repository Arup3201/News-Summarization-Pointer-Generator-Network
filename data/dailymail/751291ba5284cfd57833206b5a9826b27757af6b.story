A drug addicted mother gave her baby a heroin substitute to 'knock him out' so she could take crack cocaine 'in peace', a court has heard.

Kelly Emery, 34, of Frankley, Worcestershire, was charged with manslaughter after her son Fenton Hogan died of a methadone overdose on July 1, 2013.

Emery denies giving the two-year-old the heroin substitute to make him sleep and is currently on trial at Nottingham Crown Court.

On the second day of her trial jurors heard the baby was 'energetic and happy' right up until his death.

But his grandmother Angela Emery, Kelly Emery's mother, told the court her daughter 'cared more about drugs than her children'.

When she was asked how her daughter funded her habit in the months before Fenton's death, Mrs Emery said: 'Selling herself, basically.

'She would phone [me] regularly for money - she would claim it was for gas, electricity or food.'

Mrs Emery said her daughter had been addicted to drugs since the age of 17.

She said it was clear from her daughter's home and her appearance that she was an addict.

Mrs Emery told the court the house was mess and her daughter was 'not bothered' about housework or ensuring the children had clean clothes. 

She added Emery began developing scabs on her face and arms

In the months before his death the court heard Emery had been referred to Birmingham Social Services.

However, Mrs Emery said she did not share her concerns with social workers because past referrals had led nowhere.

Following his death Mrs Emery told police Fenton and his older sister, then 12, were an 'inconvenience' to Emery.

But she added she did not think her daughter had wanted Fenton to die.

Fenton's paternal grandmother Lynn Wheeldon also gave evidence. 

She took care of the baby the day before his death. She said he was happy when she returned him home on Sunday, June 30, 2013.

She said the previous week he had spent time with his older cousins.

She told the court: 'He enjoyed his day with us. He was happy, bubbly, it was a lovely warm day.'

A post-mortem examination revealed Fenton had ingested methadone at least twice before his death

Emery has pleaded guilty to causing Fenton's death by gross negligence but denies charges of manslaughter and cruelty.

Christopher Hotten QC, prosecuting, alleged Emery deliberately gave the toddler methadone in order to 'knock him out' so she could take crack cocaine in peace.

The trial continues.
