Sophie Countess of Wessex looked radiant today as she posed for a portrait in Qatar following her week-long tour of India.

The royal, 48, donned a blue chiffon scarf, a white jacket and patterned trousers as she smiled for the camera in the courtyard of the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha.Â 

The museum, which is located on the waterfront, houses a collection of Islamic works spanning 1,400 years.

Elegant: The mother-of-two swept her blonde hair into an elegant ponytail before posing for photos at the waterfront museum

The mother-of-two, who had swept her blonde hair into an elegant ponytail, had the opportunity to pose for photos and was shown around the building.

She visited the museum with the charity ORBIS, who work in developing countries to save sight.

She then changed into a stunning red dress - complete with a matching red shawl - and nude heels to meet with the Prime Minister of Qatar Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani at the Doha Palace.

It comes only a day after the Countess completed a week-long trip to India with the charity, where she was required to put hygiene ahead of style as she visited an eye hospital in Kolkata, West Bengal.

She was forced to pull protective blue shoe covers on over her feet as she entered the operating theatre at the Susrut Eye Foundation on Friday.

The hospital is an advanced eye care unit and Sophie had the opportunity to learn about the sight-saving treatments they carry out.

She even had the chance to also try her hand at cataract surgery using a simulator.

The Countess had her hair pulled back in a slightly messier ponytail, but was not asked to don any other scrubs than the shoe covers.

She wore a palm tree print dress with a silver jacket and matching clutch bag and had a purple pashmina draped around her neck.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex wore protective shoe covers in the operating theatre at Susrut Eye Foundation and Hospital on day 3 of her visit to India

The charity launched the India childhood blindness initiative in 2002 to help 
ensure that the country's children have access to quality eye care.

Sophie was able to see the progress 
the initiative has been making and met patients who have benefited from 
the technology and medical expertise at the facility.

The
visit came on day three of her trip to India that 
she undertook without her husband Prince Edward.

On
Thursday, she saw how the eye medics are reaching people in 
poverty-stricken areas using a plane that has been converted into a 
flying opthalmic hospital and training facility.

Later she dressed up in an embellished top as she attended a reception for ORBIS volunteers at the ITC Sonar Hotel

Susrut is an advanced ophthalmology eye care instituition and during her solo visit to India the Countess is supporting the sight saving charity ORBIS

Sophie met patients, staff and 
volunteers on board the converted DC-10 Aircraft which ORBIS uses to 
improve eye care for people in rural communities.

Later the same day, she put on her glad rags to attend a reception at the Kolkata Hotel. She wore a silk black and silver print wrap dress and carried the same silver bag she was seen with on Friday.

On the first day of her visit, Sophie met orphaned children from Kolkata who are being supported by the charity Future Hope.

Greetings: The Countess met families who have benefited from the charity's support
