Cheryl Cole has mysteriously closed down a £2.5 million Irish company which has apparently helped her avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in UK corporation tax in the last three years. 

The company, Tara Entertainments Ltd, set up in 2011, was widely seen as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax on her international earnings than would be owed in Britain.

But both Tara and its British-based parent company CC Entertainments International were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, suggesting that the star is keen to avoid accusations that she is dodging tax.

The move came just days before Gary Barlow and two other members of Britain’s most successful boy band, Take That, learned that they owed millions in unpaid tax after an investment vehicle they had been using was ruled to be a tax avoidance scheme.

While Cole’s actions are perfectly legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting earnings of at least this much have been funnelled through the company.

If so, the singer would have avoided paying more than £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent in the republic – compared to 21 per cent in the UK.

Meanwhile, documents for the  liquidation of the UK company, CC Entertainments – which in 2013 only declared £1 in net assets – now show it has cash of £1.88 million, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner once liquidation is complete.

If the money has been moved from Ireland to the UK, taxes could be liable on that amount. But last night a leading accountant said that Cole could add to her savings by declaring the windfall as a capital gain, liable for 10 per cent tax under business tax relief rules – as opposed to paying up to 45 per cent income tax on declared income.

‘[Irish companies] are a very popular way of lowering the amount of corporation tax owed compared to that in the UK,’ he said. ‘When you bring your money back into Britain, if you liquidate your company, the money can be drawn out as a capital gain which means you only pay 10 per cent tax.’

Neither Cole’s Irish accountant nor her spokesman would comment last night, but company filings seen by The Mail on Sunday confirm Cole’s role in the company: ‘Tara Entertainments was 100 per cent owned by CC Entertainments International Ltd a company registered in the UK. The directors consider the ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party of the company to be Cheryl Cole.’

Tara and CC Entertainments International were set up with the help of Irish music industry accountant Alan McEvoy, who is the accountant for some of the UK and Ireland’s biggest names in music. He lists money-making machine One Direction, JLS and a host of other stars among his clients.

Last year it was reported that another client, former X Factor star Olly Murs, incurred an Irish tax bill of €61,735 (£49,067) on earnings of €516,816 (£410,765) through his Irish company in 2012 – much less than he would have paid in the UK.

McEvoy also acts for Ronan Keating and his estranged wife Yvonne, and has also looked after Boyzone and Girls Aloud. Just this month, McEvoy set up a company with One Direction member Harry Styles called HSA Publishing Ltd – adding to suggestions that the heart-throb star may be about to launch a solo career.

A statement on McEvoy’s website reads: ‘Our strength lies in bespoke financial and accounting packages to suit the client. Our services can range from dealing with a client once a year regarding tax compliance to dealing with a client on a week to week basis on their financial and accounting management.’

Cole’s rearrangement of her financial affairs comes amid growing condemnation of all forms of tax avoidance in the UK. 

In the last two years companies such as Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and Google have been heavily criticised for declaring their profits in Ireland and other low tax jurisdictions, while celebrities have also come under the HMRC spotlight. 

HM Revenue & Customs always refuses to comment on individual cases but has previously emphasised it will not ‘tolerate abuse of the system’.
