Chelsea, flush from their £220million shirt sponsorship deal with Yokohama Rubber, are now following the Manchester United route by looking for a training kit backer as well.

Chelsea, no doubt, will be looking to get as near as they can to the £120m figure over eight years that United have attracted from American insurance giants Aon for training gear branding as well as title sponsorship of their Carrington training complex. 

Liverpool also have separate training kit sponsors in Indonesian airline Garuda.

Chelsea had been lagging behind Manchester United in the sponsorship stakes but the Yokohama agreement, worth £38m annually for five years plus another potential £30m in bonuses, has fully vindicated demanding owner Roman Abramovich’s desire to challenge for the No 1 position on and off the pitch.

Chelsea’s new commercial chief Christian Purslow hired outside agency HTH, run by two former Manchester United executives, to help with his sponsorship hunt. 

Their success in bringing in the second highest British shirt sponsorship from a standing start last October further exposes the FA commercial department’s chronic year-long failure to land an FA Cup sponsor.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it is business as usual for his Zurich staff, who have been told not to get involved in any electioneering that would be in breach of regulations that were not in place last time Blatter faced competition for his crown. 

However, FIFA and Blatter — bidding for a fifth term — are so intertwined it is impossible for the communications team not to effectively support Blatter in their day-to-day work. 

So, unless the president forms a stand-alone campaign team, he is making a mockery of the election process. 

But FIFA have insisted that Blatter was not intending to set up a separate election operation as he was not campaigning.

The most awkward moment at the IFAB summit in Belfast so far was FA chairman Greg Dyke’s quick welcome handshake with Sepp Blatter. 

But 78-year-old Blatter’s remarkably sunny disposition in Northern Ireland was down, he admitted, to being accompanied by his glamorous 50-year-old girlfriend Linda Barras.

The IFAB delegates, after being entertained last night at Stormont Castle by first minister Peter Robinson, are dining at the Titanic Museum tonight, although Blatter shows no sign of sinking.

Lord Coe is in campaign mode on the IAAF presidential election trail, taking in Jamaica, Marseille and Addis Ababa in one week. 

Coe’s rival Sergey Bubka, who has yet to make any policy announcement, chose to go to the IOC executive committee in Rio, where there were no votes to canvass.

This allowed Coe to have the stage to himself in the south of France, where 23 voting athletics federations were present.

Qatar blows hot and cold

Qatar's World Cup 2022 organising committee took the FIFA task force delegates out for dinner in Doha at an open-air restaurant after agreeing to a November-December scheduling of the tournament because of the intense heat in the summer. 

Ironically, it was so cold for the diners that blankets had to be brought out to keep them warm.

The FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes and vice president David Griffiths are still insisting that the gentlemen’s agreement between the Home Nations chiefs from the 2011 IFAB meeting at Celtic Manor is relevant today. 

That would mean it is Wales’s turn to provide the British vice-president on the FIFA ExCo. But the three other countries regard the changes in statutes that see the whole of UEFA voting for the British place voiding that pact. 

So Lloyd Hughes, much to his chagrin, will miss out on the $200,000-a-year stipend plus $500 a day and expenses as England’s David Gill, already on the UEFA ExCo, is a certainty to be elected.

It’s a sign of the times that neither the Chelsea or Tottenham owner will attend the VIP lunch for the Capital One Cup finalists at Wembley tomorrow. 

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich prefers to attend games surrounded by his own Russian entourage while Tottenham’s Joe Lewis rarely goes to games — even cup finals. 

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck and his Spurs counterpart Daniel Levy will head their club’s delegations.
