A terminally ill mother's dying wish was fulfilled after she celebrated her son's first birthday with a traditional party with cake, balloons and a bouncy castle.

Jorie Rogers has a rare form of cancer which causes tumors all over her body and was told she would be made infertile by her radiation treatment.

Despite the odds, she gave birth to 'miracle' baby Tristan last year. But Mrs Rogers was told she would not live to see Tristan turn two, so she wanted to make his first birthday special.

Terminally ill cancer sufferer Jorie Rogers wanted to make the first birthday of her son Tristan special because it is likely to be the last she spends with him

Many happy returns: The special birthday party had everything a child could wish for including clowns and balloons

After Mrs Rogers, who lives in Missouri, struggled with mounting medical bills, it seemed unlikely that the party for Tristan, who has Down's Syndrome, would go ahead.

Mrs Rogers' wish was granted however, when an Illinois charity stepped in and threw Tristan a carnival to celebrate his first year.

The party included clowns, balloons, a
bouncy castle and a colorful birthday cake. Mrs Rogers said: ‘It's so 
much more than I could have hoped for. It's amazing,’

She
told KSDK: ‘It's very special because not only are we celebrating my 
son's first year and everything that he had to go through to get here, 
but it's the one birthday that I'll get with him. And we get to 
celebrate the one year that we had together.’

Amid preparations for the party, Mrs Rogers decided to stop all treatments and come home to live her remaining days.

She said: 'My cancer has unfortunately 
progressed to a point where there's really nothing else that we can do. 
We've pretty much run the gamut and tried everything.

A colorful iced cake was made especially for the occasion - which Tristan seemed to thoroughly enjoy judging by the smile on his face

It was the first and last birthday that Missouri mom Jorie Rogers would likely spend with her son, Tristan

'So we're just going to live out the rest of the days as best we can and be as happy as we can with the time we have left.

Although Tristan will be too young to 
remember the party, Mrs Rogers wanted him to have photos and videos of 
the day as keepsakes after she passes away.

Loved ones gather to celebrate Tristan's first birthday for what is likely the only birthday his mother will get to celebrate with him

She added: ‘I want him to be able to look back on videos and pictures from today and hear the stories about today, and for him to know how much his mom loved him. And for him to know how hard his mom fought to be here for him.’

The charity which organized the party, 3 Little Birds 4 Life, has also fixed a young man’s ‘chemo teeth’ and helped a person with brain cancer go to Disney World.
