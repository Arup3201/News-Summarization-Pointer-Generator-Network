From a young age Tanya Crawley dreamed of becoming a vet.

And the mother-of-two was so determined that she refused to let a potentially life-threatening allergy to animals get in the way of owning her own veterinary practice.

The 38-year-old faces a daily battle against sneezing and spluttering, sticking to a rigorous timetable of medications to help ease her symptoms.

But carrying out a routine examination on a dog, cat or rabbit can render the vet incapacitated, fighting to breathe and suffering from a painful skin rash.

Vet Tanya Crawley faces a daily battle against a potentially life-threatening allergy to animals

Every day is a fight against the allergy, with Ms Crawley keeping a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close to hand.

Despite the constant battle, Ms Crawley refuses to let her allergy get in the way of the job she loves.

She said: 'Being a vet is part of who I am - I have never even considered doing anything else.

'I’ve known that I’ve been allergic to cat and dogs from a fairly young age, and the rabbit allergy seemed to develop a few years ago.

'It can be hard sometimes but as long as I’m careful and ensure I have good hand hygiene, then I get along fine.

'I am most allergic to rabbits, so if I feel like my airways are starting to close up I’ll just step outside and take a few puffs on my inhaler.

'It would probably be better for me to wear gloves and a mask when I’m treating an animal, but I don’t think it’s fair on them - a mask can look quite scary and you can’t examine them properly with gloves on.

So severe is the 38-year-old's allergy, that a routine examination can leave her fighting to breathe and with a painful skin rash

The mother-of-two is particularly allergic to rabbits. She keeps a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close at hand to keep her symptoms at bay

'Sometimes I’m snuffly during a consulation, but I assure the owners I’m not contagious. The animals are never put in in any danger, so I’ll keep going for as long as I can - I just love my job.'

Ms Crawley first discovered she was allergic to animals when her family took a dog home from Battersea Dogs Home.

She said: 'When I was a child I went to Battersea with my dad and my sister and we came home with a dog.

'It was common in those days to be allergy tested and shortly after I found out I was allergic to a few animals.

'I remember playing with my friend’s kitten, Jellicoe, and after she had scratched me a little, as all kittens do, my skin erupted in red wheals.

'My allergies are constantly changing and evolving - I think I’ve recently developed an allergy to fleas. It starts with an itch in my nose, and I can tell as soon a pet with fleas walks into the room.

'I’d say I’m allergic to pretty much all of the animals that I treat on a regular basis.

'Once I had to treat a giant rabbit and in the car on my way home I really started to struggle to breathe.

'I stepped out of my car and nearly had to call an ambulance - it was really scary. This is when I first realised that I had developed an allergy to rabbits and that I’d need to control it.

'Rabbits are by far the worst - after I’ve seen about three or four rabbits in a row I’ll need to take some time out.'

But despite her serious allergies, Ms Crawley, who runs the veterinary practice at Companion Care Vets in Swindon, continues to be dedicated to her profession and refuses to let them get in the way of delivering the best patient care that she can.

Ms Crawley first discovered she was allergic to animals when, as a child, her family picked up a dog from Battersea Dogs Home

'I take antihistamines most days, and I have to have my inhalers with me at all times, in case of emergency.

'Most owners wouldn’t know I have these allergies, as I manage to control them so well.

'If I know I’ve got a particularly heavy day - especially with lots of rabbits then I’ll take extra medication.

'I also have a fantastic team around me that support me and would know what to do if I had an

extreme reaction.'

But whilst Tanya battles on through her allergies, she often finds them frustrating.

She said: 'To be honest I just find them a bit annoying.

'It just irritates me and I hate getting wheezy because I can barely speak. I find it a bit embarrassing but I just try not to think about it most of the time.'

But despite her allergies, being a vet has always been a dream of Tanya’s.

She added: 'I have never wanted to do anything other than being a vet.

'As a little girl, when my friends were saying they wanted to be princesses and fairies when they grew up, I always wanted to be a vet.

'All my soft toys were animals and I absolutely adored our family pets.

But Ms Crawley refuses to let the allergy get in the way of her dream. She said: Being a vet, allergies or not, is part of being me, I just love it'

'I just love animals - the bond that you can have with a pet is just incredible, and I love that I can be there for an animal, and find out what’s wrong with them when they could never tell you themselves - I give them a voice.

'I knew that I’d run into some difficulty being a vet, but I can control my allergies with medications and inhalers, so I’ll keep going for as long as I can.

'I have never thought about doing anything else.

Despite the constant challenges, the lack of rest breaks, the long hours, and my allergies, I just love being a vet. I wouldn’t swap it for anything.

'I spend most of my down time working, either talking to anxious owners or tending to one of the many abandoned pets that come to us.

'Every pet deserves to be loved and cared for, and they are an absolute privilege to own and to work with.

'Being a vet, allergies or not, is part of being me, I just love it.'
