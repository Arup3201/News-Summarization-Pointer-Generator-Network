When multi-millionaire Giles Mackay planned his family’s dream home, every detail had to be perfect.

The property tycoon set out meticulous plans for the £100million house, even telling workers he wanted his new library’s leather shelves to be hand-stitched to look like the upholstery in an Aston Martin.

But when the vast project was hit by delays, his relationship with his design team appears to have soured dramatically.

Abuse: Property developer Giles Mackay branded an architect a 'f****** little t***' and boasted about his superior wealth in a string of abusive emails

Mr Mackay, 50, said he woke up in the 
morning wanting to kill his architect, and described the wife of another
 business partner as ‘avaricious and jealous’ and ‘needing a ******* 
good slapping’.

He sent around 3,700 emails to firms 
involved in the project. In one, to a director of his building 
contractors, he fumed: ‘My middle name is “Relentless”. I have the money
 and anger at this point to push on and make sure that you have to 
deliver or get punished for not delivering.’

He went on: ‘Guess what, when I have 
forgotten about you in a year’s time, enjoying my £100million home or 
sailing on one of my 40-metre yachts, you’ll still be trying to wind up 
some other poor unsuspecting customer with your brand of mediocrity – a 
sad loser – gaining your kicks and being irritating.

‘Suggest a new career as a traffic 
warden might be ideal at least it wouldn’t involve lying.’ Mr Mackay, 
who is worth around £134million, threatened to sue the contractor, 
Walter Lilly & Company, over the delays and alleged defects in their
 work at his house, on one of Britain’s most expensive streets.

But a High Court judge said he had 
‘lost nearly all sense of objectivity’ over the house in Kensington, 
West London, and branded the project ‘a disaster waiting to happen’.

Mr Justice Akenhead said Mr Mackay’s 
behaviour to his architect and the contractors was ‘not simply coarse’ 
but ‘combative, bullying and aggressive’.

Mr Mackay, a trained barrister who 
founded the property data company Hometrack and affordable homes 
specialist Assettrust, bought the five-storey townhouse in 2004. He 
wanted it to be a dream home for him, his wife and their two children, 
complete with a swimming pool, basement cinema, wine cellar, gymnasium, 
staff quarters, a guest suite and a state-of-the-art ‘light wall’.

His wife Caroline, a solicitor, spent 
hours planning it and told the High Court she wanted it to be ‘modern, 
stylish, with great attention to detail, luxurious with the highest 
quality of finish with smart, shiny dark glossy floors, luxurious 
bathrooms, beautiful lighting and elegant perfect finishes’.

It appeared cost was no object, as 
estimates warned that the stitching on the library’s leather shelves 
alone was likely to top £41,000. But as work began, Mr and Mrs Mackay 
noticed a growing number of faults.

The agreed ‘American Black Walnut’ for
 the floors was too orange, there were no ballet bars in the gym and Mrs
 Mackay described the finish in her children’s bathrooms as ‘a 
disgrace’.

Mr Mackay said ‘every room in the 
house contained defective plastering’ and told his architects, Barrett 
Lloyd Davis Associates, they were ‘a disgrace to [their] profession’.

The case ended up in court earlier 
this year after Walter Lilly & Company claimed money had been taken 
off its payment for alleged defects and delays.

Mr Mackay’s firm, DMW Developments, 
counter-sued, asking for damages for alleged defects in the work, and 
saying it had overpaid for the work.

But Mr Justice Akenhead ruled in favour of Walter Lilly and said it was owed more than £2.3million.

Mr Mackay, who spent more than £6million on legal work for the case, said he plans to appeal against the judgment.
