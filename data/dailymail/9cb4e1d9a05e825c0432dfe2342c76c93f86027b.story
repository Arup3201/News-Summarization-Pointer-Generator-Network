A tortoise was taken for an emergency visit to the vet after he got an electrical cable stuck under his shell.

Mr T, a giant African spurred tortoise, was stretching his legs on owner Jill Johnstone's lawn when he became entangled in the cable from a garden strimmer.

Fortunately, vets were able to free the cable from around the animal's neck and remove the plug that was wedged under his shell. And today Mr T was pictured back in the garden.  

Tangled: Mr T had the garden strimmer cable wrapped around his body and the plug wedged under his shell

Back in action: Today the tortoise was seen walking happily around Mrs Johnstone's garden

Beloved: Mrs Johnstone, pictured with her pet, got Mr T when he was the 'size of a 50p piece'

Mrs Johnstone, 60, has owned Mr T, whose shell now weighs 11.7kg, 'since he was as big as a 50p piece'.

She said that it was 'panic stations' when her beloved six-year-old pet got into trouble in the garden.

She said: 'My son Scott was putting the strimmer away when Mr T walked over the wire and got it wrapped around his neck and the three pin plug stuck under his shell and between it and his front leg.'

'Scott was very calm but I was really panicking as we tried to pull him loose and we couldn’t get him free.

'His head was stuck outside his shell when his natural response was to try and go back into the shell which really didn’t help things.' 

The two had to cut the strimmer wire before rushing to vets near their home in Alfreton, Derbyshire. 

Vet Lisa Fotheringham: 'We had never had anything like this in the clinic before - most tortoises are smaller than Mr T and we think it was his large size that enabled this accident to happen.' 

Mr T was left with just minor bruising after vets and allowed home, where Mrs Johnstone's family have since been doting on him.

Mrs Johnstone added: 'I wanted to make sure he was okay so I’ve been gently stroking his shell to keep him calm and shutting his eyes.

'He loves banana and soon he was back to normal munching away. In the summer he goes in and out of the house and in the winter he will come inside with me where he’l sit under his sun lamp.

'Bizarre accident': Vets were able to free Jill Johnstone's beloved six-year-old pet after the incident

Doting: Mrs Johnstone's grandchildren, six-year-old Reece and Lexi, three, are now busy looking after Mr T

'I was really worried that they wouldn’t be able to get the wire and plug out of his shell but the vets were marvellous and I can’t thank them enough for all they did for Mr T. He’s one very lucky tortoise.' 

The African spurred, or sulcata, tortoise, gets its name from the 'spurs' - enlarged bony scales on its hind legs. 

Native to African countries including Ethiopia, Sudan and Chad - the animal lives in areas where there may be no rain for several years. In the wild they depend on succulent plants for food and water.

This species of tortoise, which can live for more than 50 years, need to be carefully looked after and require specialist handling and treatment, otherwise they can suffer painful and potentially fatal diseases.
