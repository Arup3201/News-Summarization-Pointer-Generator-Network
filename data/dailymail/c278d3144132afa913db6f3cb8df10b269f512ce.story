A British father considered the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann kidnapping for six years blew open the case after coming forward to police with his child's distinctive frilly pyjamas.

The mystery man's involvement was ruled out after detectives realised he was taking his own two-year-old daughter home from a crèche and had not snatched Maddie.

He even agreed to be pictured in the clothes he wore in Praia da Luz, on May 3, 2007, to prove he was the man in the police sketch previously seen as key to cracking the case.

His two-year-old's pink pyjamas, which were described by one of the McCann's closest friends, were also brought to Scotland Yard to help prove his innocence.

'Revelation moment': Police revealed a major breakthrough when a British father came forward to reveal he was the man who for six years had been considered the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case

Evidence: The girl seen at 9.15pm wore distinctive pyjamas and the prime suspect also brought these to police to prove his innocence

DCI Andy Redwood, the Met officer leading the investigation, described it as a 'revelation moment' and completely changed when they thought Madeleine was kidnapped.

The Metropolitan Police last night confirmed it had ruled out a sighting of the man previously seen near the McCanns’ Portuguese apartment.

Jane Tanner, a close friend of Kate and Gerry, previously told officers she saw a dark-haired man carrying away a child wearing pink floral pyjamas at 9.15pm on May 3, 2007.

One of the so-called ‘Tapas Seven’, Miss Tanner had been dining with the McCanns in a nearby restaurant when their daughter went missing.

All change: Jane Tanner, a close friend of Kate and Gerry, described a dark-haired man carrying away a child at 9.15pm on May 3, 2007, but this man came forward

But this has been found not to involve Madeleine.

Police probe: DCI Andy Redwood last night reveals that he was 'almost certain that the man seen by Jane Tanner is not Madeleine's abductor'

The revelation has shifted detectives’ focus on to a later sighting at 10pm when an Irish family reported seeing a man walking towards the beach carrying a blonde girl in pyjamas.

She appeared to be in an uncomfortable position with her head slumped against him.

DCI Redwood said: 'Our focus in terms of 
understanding what happened on the night of May 3 has now given us a 
shift of emphasis. We are almost certain that the man seen by Jane 
Tanner is not Madeleine's abductor.

'It
 takes us through to a position at 10pm when we see another man who is 
walking towards the ocean, close by to the apartment, with a young child
 in his arms.'

Today it was revealed the police may have made a major 
breakthrough in the hunt for Madeleine after more than 1,000 people came 
forward with fresh information and several named the same man as the 
prime suspect.

The 
three-year-old's disappearance was reconstructed in a dramatic BBC 
Crimewatch appeal last night and Scotland Yard has today hailed a 'truly
 unprecedented' response.

Detectives believe a suspect seen 
carrying a child 500 yards from the McCanns’ holiday apartment was the 
kidnapper who struck just before her mother went to check on her children. 

Timeline: A Crimewatch special last October revealed that police believe the prime suspect was a man seen carrying a child at around 10pm on May 3, 2007. The current dig is set to start on land very close to where he was seen

This means Kate McCann may have missed the abduction of her daughter by a matter of minutes on May 3, 2007.

Last night several tourists who were in Praia da 
Luz that night have come forward, and crucially two have named the same person.
