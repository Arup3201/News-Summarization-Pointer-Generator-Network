In what local police have described as a 'pretty horrific scene,' a Florida man - who was arrested on domestic battery charges less than a month ago - is suspected of fatally stabbing his girlfriend and her 9-month-old son multiple times before turning the knife on himself.

Authorities in Hernando Oaks, a relatively safe golf community about 60 miles north of Tampa, say 28-year-old Jamil Etayem stabbed his 23-year-old girlfriend, Roseanna Sanson, and her infant son, Carter, in what appears to be a gruesome double-murder suicide.

'It was a pretty horrific scene,' Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis told reporters on Friday. 'It was shocking even 
to hardened law enforcement officers, and even our dispatchers are 
having a little bit of a difficult time with it. Fortunately, we don't 
see this very often.'

Killer: Authorities say Jamil Etayem fatally stabbed his girlfriend and her infant son before turning the knife on himself

Deputies were called to the home the couple was renting inside the gated community about 10 p.m. Thursday after a neighbor who'd heard the couple arguing in the afternoon noticed the house had gone silent and there were no lights on.

'Unfortunately when we got here we found all three of the individuals, 
including the 9-month-old little boy, deceased,' Nienhuis said.

The couple had just moved to Florida from Ohio in July. Deputies had been called to the home for domestic violence incidents twice since they'd moved in.

Authorities said that the only weapon used was a knife - or knives - and that it appears Etayem killed Sanson and then the baby, who had a different biological father.

When deputies arrived on the scene, the garage door was open and it appeared that the car was in the process of being packed - perhaps suggesting that Sanson was planning on leaving.

Etayem first found himself on the Sheriff's Office's radar on August 20, when deputies responded to the home the couple shared after receiving several calls of an 'irrational subject' at the home who was threatening to harm himself.

On August 24, Etayem was booked into jail on domestic battery charges. He was bailed out by a family member the next day.

According to Hernando Today, Etayem's bond was set at a mere $500. Conditions of his release included staying away from Sanson.

Sheriff Niehuis maintains that his deputies 'followed protocol' in regard to Estayem's August arrest.

'This really illustrates as much information is out there about domestic
violence we can't stress enough to those victims to seek out help,' 
Nienhuis said. 'No one wants to move out of a house, especially if young
children are involved, but your life may depend on it.'

Following Etayem's August 20 arrest, Sanson wrote a statement for sheriff's deputies claiming that on August 19, Etayem kicked her and her son out of the house in the middle of the night. According to her statement, Etayem drove Sanson and her son to homeless shelters and then to the police station

Sanson claims that the next morning, Etayem threatened to kill himself when she told him she planned to move back to Ohio.

Additionally, the report claims that Etayem threatened to kill himself and Sanson's baby with a knife.

Etayem's court date for the previous domestic battery charge was scheduled for Tuesday.Â
