U.S fashion brands such as Gap, Victoria’s Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch and Urban Outfitters are already familiar sights to many British shoppers – but the American clothing invasion is showing no signs of letting up.

The reportedly favourite clothes store of Michelle Obama, J.Crew, is opening its first major British outlet at 10am this Friday, on London’s trendy Regent Street.

Other famous fans of J.Crew include Blake Lively, Katie Holmes, Bradley Cooper, Michelle Williams, Samantha Cameron, Angelina Jolie and Sarah Jessica Parker.

J.Crew has already dipped its toes in the waters of the British marketplace with a small menswear store on London’s Lamb’s Conduit Street and in addition to this and its flagship Regent Street store will be opening a women’s ‘Collection’ boutique in Brompton Cross later in November.

Millard Drexler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of J.Crew, said: ‘London was an easy decision - it's a place where people understand and respect the integrity of great style and great design. We share this appreciation and are excited to introduce J.Crew to more customers throughout the UK.’

Commenting on the location of the smaller men’s and women’s stores, he said: ‘I love that every neighbourhood throughout London has its own unique personality – it’s a lot like New York City in that way.  After a lot of looking around and visiting various areas, we came across these two very different locations and knew – both were too good to pass up.’

Britain is an attractive prospect for many U.S retailers as they see it as a reliable source of revenue and the gateway to the continent.

Maureen Hinton, an analyst at market research company Verdict told The Guardian: ‘They often see the UK as a good jumping off point for Europe.

Property expert James Ebel, from Harper Dennis Hobbs, echoed her thoughts.

He told the paper: ‘When a U.S retailer reaches an optimum number of stores in its domestic market they turn to Canada and then to Europe or Asia. Many choose the UK because it is a sophisticated retail market, while London is at the centre of the worldwide fashion scene.’

J.Crew may be able to vacuum up shoppers who’ve turned their backs on Marks & Spencer.

The company has reported its ninth consecutive quarter of sliding clothing and homeware sales.

The retailer said like-for-like general merchandise sales dropped 1.3 per cent between July and September on a year earlier, slightly above City hopes and better than a 1.6 per cent first-quarter decline.

Underlying pre-tax profits dropped 8.9 per cent to £261.6 million during the six months to the end of September, weighed down by the cost of the star-studded launch of its autumn/winter clothing range.
