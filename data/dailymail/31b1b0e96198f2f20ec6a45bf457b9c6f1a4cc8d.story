At one point Pendleton performs a few bounces on a workout ball.

'For the first in forever we're hiring . . . don't know if I'm elated or gassy but I'm somewhere in that zone,' he chimes.

After the music cuts, Pendleton stops dancing and continues on a more serious note: 'Don't stay frozen in your current job. If you've ever had a desire to become a police officer visit our website.

'We don't care if you're a bit of a fixer-upper or you just like to have fun in summer.'

Pendledon told ABC News that he came up with the unconventional recruitment video while watching Disney's Frozen a few months back.

It took around 12 hours to film and edit the two-minute-28-second-long clip. 

Recalling the production process, Pendleton said: 'I came after work in the evening when no one was in the building.

'It took me about four hours total to film everything, and the editing took about six to eight hours to finish.'
