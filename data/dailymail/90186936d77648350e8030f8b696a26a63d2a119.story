Despite the strength in numbers of regional voting, Janet Devlin lost her place in The X Factor semi-final last night.

After battling Misha B in the bottom two, it seems her native Northern Ireland couldn't save her.

It comes as little surprise, considering the 17-year-old forgot the lyrics to her first song on Saturday while performing Hanson track MMMBop in the Guilty Pleasures round.

Luck of the Irish ran out: Janet Devlin was sent home last night after singing for survival against Misha B

The redhead performed well in the sing-off, tapping into the innocence of her very first audition with a rendition of Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol.

But as Misha B belted out a hit from the Fame soundtrack, nailing her version of Out Here On My Own by Irene Cara, it was clear who was going to be saved.

Judge Louis Walsh said: 'It's getting
tougher and tougher. I'm taking everything into consideration, judging 
on last night's two performances and the sing-off. The act I'm sending 
home is Janet.'

Fellow panellist Tulisa Contostavlos 
followed his lead, saying: 'I'm going to base my decision on the person 
who has a career after the show, who will sell records and sell out 
arenas.

'I'm sorry to say I'm sending home Janet.'

Their mentor Kelly Rowland turned on the waterworks, refusing to decide between the two.

She
said: 'I know how great these two young ladies are. Janet, I admire you
as a musician and you bring something so unique to the music industry. I
absolutely love you and adore you.

'Misha, my goodness girl, you just want this so bad. I have to pass it, I'm sorry.'

This
meant that the majority verdict overruled, without Gary Barlow even 
having his say, as Dermot O'Leary declared Janet was going home.

However, when O'Leary later quizzed Barlow, he said: 'I'd have sent Janet home.'

Janet simply said: 'I'm feeling very confused. I can't wait to leave the show and get my music out there.'

The show opened with guest 
appearances from Olly Murs and Jessie J, before the live show finalists 
sang charity single Wishing On A Star - which saw the return of Craig 
Colton and Sophie Habibis.

JLS
and One Direction joined the contestants onstage, after they were 
called in at the last minute by Simon Cowell in a bid to boost sales on 
the track in honour of Together For Short Lives.

Dermot announced: 'Good news. The chancellor has decided to waive VAT on the single, so all money will go to charity.'

Little Mix, Amelia Lily, Marcus Collins and Misha B will now compete in the semi-final next week.

Meanwhile, 14.1milion tuned in to see Devlin voted off last night, compared to 2.5million less for rival Strictly Come Dancing.

Over the past few weeks, Strictly Come Dancing tends to win the biggest audience during the Saturday show, but the X Factor results draw more.
