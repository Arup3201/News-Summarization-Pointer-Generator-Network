A teenager paralysed two years ago in a tragic ice hockey accident has returned to the ice.

Matt Brown, 17, from Norwood, Massachusetts, dropped the ceremonial puck before the start of Saturday's game between the Boston Bruins and the New York Islanders.

He did so while debuting a new state-of-the-art wheelchair that allows him mobility while in an upright position.

Back on the ice: Paralysed 17-year-old Matt Brown meets his ice hockey idols before Saturday's Bruins-Islanders game in Boston

The teenager is a longtime Bruins fans and admitted being star-struck while out on the ice with some of his sports idols.

'It was pretty mind blowing go out, but I’ve been around those guys before,' he said.

'They weren’t on skates when I first saw them so it was pretty cool.'

Matt was paralysed from the chest down on January 23, 2010 after suffering a spinal chord injury during a high school hockey game.

The teenager recently received his new wheelchair through funds raised at the Matt Brown Gala hosted by the Boston Bruins Foundation and the TD Garden.

'When I was first injured, Patrice 
Bergeron sent over his jersey and it had four words on it: "Be 
patient, stay positive"'

Matt has made great progress since his injury while working with Journey Forward, a nonprofit rehabilitation facility in Canton.

He said he is much stronger than he was two years ago and can now breathe on his own.

'When I was first injured, Patrice Bergeron sent over his jersey and it had four simple words on it, "Be patient, stay positive,"' Matt told TheBostonChannel.com.

'Those four words have stuck with me everyday.'

Matt's next goal is to complete the wheelchair division of this year's Boston Marathon.

His friend, Army Ranger Luke Carr, who will be pushing his chair for the 26.2 mile race said that Matt will be inspiring him throughout.

Matt, who graduates this spring from high school, is currently searching for a college to attend in the fall. He said he would have never made it this far without the support of his family, friends and the community.
