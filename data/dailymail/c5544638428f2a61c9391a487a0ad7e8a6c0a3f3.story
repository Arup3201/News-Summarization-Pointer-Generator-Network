A musical therapist who works with terminally ill children and their families at Cincinnati Children's Hospital has begun creating musical memories using the heartbeats of dying patients.

Brian Schreck records the thump of a patient's heartbeat using an improvised stethoscope microphone, and then lays an instrumental version of their favorite song over the top.

The result is a precious preservation of the patient's humanity, says Schreck.

From the heart: Musical therapist Brian Schreck uses an improvised stethoscope microphone to record the heartbeats of dying patients

Precious legacy: Schreck then records an instrumental of the patient's favorite song and lays it over the heartbeat

Schreck was struck by the need to preserve some essence of a person when a mother whose daughter was dying told him she was afraid she would forget her daughter's voice.

He would record musical therapy sessions with patients to leave their family with a collection of memories and music, but when he began working in the intensive care units with dying patients, it became difficult to capture these moments.

'Some of these patients cannot speak, whether it is due to their age (infant), progression of illness, or intensive medical care (intubation),' writes Schreck in a blog about his work.

After seeing a story on the news of a woman's response to hearing her deceased daughter's heart beating inside a donor recipient's chest, Schreck realized he could capture a patient's 'rhythmic essence' and create music that is meaningful to the patient and their family.

'The heartbeat is the most basic, beautiful metronome. It is such a powerful, audible representation of life and of the human experience,' says Schreck.

When Margaret and Jeremy Bennett's son Dylan, 14, lay dying, he felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness.

'Our son was dying in front of us, and it was very tough. So just to hear that music, it really, really got my spirits up and I needed that,' says Jeremy Bennett.

Now, the Bennetts listen to the resulting song, Ed Sheeran's Lego House, underlaid with the steady beat of their son's heart, every day.

'To be able to have that, and carry it around on my phone. It's his heartbeat, you know? I can listen to his heartbeat whenever I choose to,' says Jeremy Bennett.

Over the last six months, Schreck has made a dozen songs, music as diverse as John Legend and Metallica, for patients and families to help them cope.

Schreck says many have played the heartbeat songs at the patient's funerals.

'To let me know that it’s in some way helping with their ability to cope with the very early onset of grief is a very rewarding thing,' he says.
